    <strong>I went outside and didn't get covid</strong>
    <p><p>Considering the doomers like to post (mostly fake) stories about "My <strong><em>_</em></strong> got covid and now has to have their head amputated! Take it seriously! Fucking anti maskers!" all over the place, I figured we should do the same and post every time one of us exists and doesn't get the virus. </p>
<p>So I just wanted to let everybody know that I went outside without a mask a bunch of times over the last month and didn't get covid. Nobody I know got covid either. </p>
<p>Please share your non-covid-getting experiences below or elsewhere on reddit.</p></p>

        <p>People i know have gotten covid but all but one has survived and he was a man in his late 80s with decaying health already. I do not believe that COVID is fake, I do however believe that it is not serious enough to give up freedoms and destroy our economy. If people WANT to wear a mask let them, if people WANT to get the vaccine, let them. But if you do not want to do these things than that should be fine as well. I feel lucky to live in an area where I feel at least half of the community does not wear a mask.</p>

        <p>Everyone I know personally who has had covid, including myself, is still alive.  No iron lung or amputations necessary.  The people I know who died WITH COVID? Had seriously bad health and many problems to begin with.</p>

        <p>I attended a gathering of more than 10 people, indoors, without a mask, and didn’t catch covid!  </p>
<p>I traveled to visit a friend in a high risk city and didn’t catch covid.</p>
<p>I went out to eat and didn’t catch covid.</p>
<p>I went to the grocery store without a mask and didn’t catch covid. </p>
<p>I go about my day to day life and don’t worry about catching the flu because the world isn’t a “safe place” and never will be and I choose not to stress about the little things.</p>

        <p>Totally catch your drift and I feel pretty similar. In my case I still chill with friends and do things out without masks as we are all young and safe. But I still wear a mask in shops as you never know if people(old/underlying conditions) around you could be less equipped to deal with it. Feel like it is a courtesy and not a big deal to wear for 15 minutes</p>

        <p>My mother (who’s in her 60’s and a smoker) and I have had covid. We laid in bed and got better. My partner who took care of me and our son did not get covid. Really wish the media would quit beating us over the head with the worst case scenarios.</p>

        <p>But I can't. I mean, I could, I suppose, but I won't be lying unless someone pays me for that real good lol</p>
<p>Anyways I went outside a ton of times, I generally wear a mask when I can't avoid bumping into people, partially because I don't get kicks out of aggravating people, and partially because I don't exactly feel like paying fines (yes, that's a thing here in Italy), and yet apparently I had covid at some point. At least that's what serology says. I didn't die though. In fact I didn't even notice the thing.</p>

        <p>I go to the store with a mask, grocery, target, been in restaurants, take my dad to his. dr’s appointments, he even went in the emergency room a 3 times (not related to covid) and so far I’ve avoided it. I didn’t regally realize people were not leaving their house at all. My uncle died of it in a nyc nursing home, my brothers whole family had it and were fine. I wear masks, but I get why people don’t. With my health I also have a hard time breathing in them.</p>

        <p>Feel free to never drive a car then. Wait no what am I saying? Makes way more sense to ban cars altogether for everyone. </p>
<p>But really... The whole point of the shitpost was to say that we are selectively pushing exceptional experiences as the norm; if everyone posted about how nothing happened with the same frequency, you would see how that far outweighs all the "it's so awful" posts.</p>
<p>Using your example... If I drive safely and I don't get in a crash, that doesn't make me lucky, that makes me the norm. If I drive safely and I get in a crash, <em>that</em> actually makes me (un)lucky, since statistically I'm way more likely to have nothing happen to me if I drive safely.</p>

        <p>Yeah I can see I screwed up my point a bit, but you give a good example of the difference between safe and reckless driving. So in your case not wearing masks could be seen as reckless driving in that example right? Like you can drive reckless for a month and not get into a crash but doesn't mean its safe. </p>
<p>I agree that the whole news is all dread and gloom and highly points out the worst case scenario all the time, but that's just the shitty news cycle as usual. It's like plane crashes, the news makes it out planes are dangerous whenever there is one when they are statistically the safest transportation method.</p>

<p>Exactly correct. However, we would need to have a serious conversation on the actual validity of the claims. For example, how do we reconcile the amount of conflicting studies on the subject of mask effectiveness? Especially now that the whole double and triple masking narrative is coming in? Basically what I'm saying is, we have to put these measures through the same process that we do things like seatbelts, drunk driving, etc. People forget that we have a process for how laws have passed, and governmental edicts passed under emergency measures are not in the same realm.</p>
<p>Short version - Yes, but we would need to have an open and honest conversation and have the measure passed through the proper legislative channels. What we've had up until this point is nowhere near close to this standard. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

        <p>Okay I understand your stance. I agree that there's been many studies arguing how exactly effective these masks are at stopping the spread, but it is agreed that they definitely do reduce the spread, especially to others. </p>
<p>A majority of evidence points to masks helping, whether it is alot or not as much as we thought. But in the meantime, surely its better to take precautions and wear them? There is no harm in wearing them for 20 minutes to shops. </p>
<p>I think the double masking that has been popping up is mainly for people who are high risk, as they have shown to give more protection.</p>
