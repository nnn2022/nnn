    <strong>Something doesn't add up (regarding the Wuhan lab leak theory thats now being acknowledged by the media)</strong>
    <p><p>Anything that supposedly leaks out is purposely done so because they want it out. Do you really think the elites don't have the capabilities to hide the news if they truly didn't want the public to find this out? Feels way too easy. I feel like there's more to the story here, perhaps to ""vindicate"" some conspiracy theorists, to make us think we've somewhat won the battle, which I think is the real trap because now there's some push to trap the conspiracy theorists too "yeah, you're right, we lied, there is a wuhan lab leak after all, but still, its real! so get the vaccine (which I think is the real threat) to protect from the bio weapon!" I can imagine them saying that.</p>
<p>Also this throws question to that other study a while back about COVID potentially spreading was early as November 2019 in Italy, when according to wikipedia + other sources, the first case was December 2019 in wuhan?</p>
<p>I don't know guys, perhaps its just overthinking but it feels like standing on a beach before an upcoming tidal wave hits. I don't think it'll be that easy that the MSM just suddenly flipped so damn fast in May 2021</p></p>

        <p>The media is still completely failing to acknowledge the fact that COVID-19 was created by Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J and AstraZeneca. </p>
<p>I think the media was deliberately going to cover up the lab “leak” until after the vaccines were widely distributed. That way, the vaccine companies would be seen as heroes of COVID, and few people would even consider the idea that the vaccine companies actually created COVID.</p>
<p>If the lab leak theory had been accepted a year ago, I think the idea that the vaccine companies had created COVID would be a lot more widespread.</p>

        <p>We're seeing the Biblical end days play out before our eyes :)</p>
<p>I don't understand every move they make but the Bible tells us the world will unite under a one world order with a one world religion</p>
<p>Right now they're destroying the old order of things... But the new world order comes in through a false light and deception. More than likely this is all controlled from both sides. It'll look like evil is being defeated but it'll be by a false good. With this in mind, it makes sense that they're bringing forth proof against Fauci</p>
<p>This is something great to look into:
https://www.lucistrust.org/arcane_school/service_the_plan_study_course</p>
<p>It's a step by step on how they've planned to roll this in from their own page. The links also open up a PDF with more details. This is the Lucis Trust. They work under the UN and the UN follows its founders ideology (Alice Bailey). Lucis Trust was formerly the Lucifer Publishing Company. Bailey was / is highly admired in the occult. She wrote many books on Lucifer and what had to be done to bring in the NWO and the false messiah (who they believe is the true messiah and not Jesus)
They've carried out everything she has written, from banning God in schools to using the media for mass control. The goal has been to destroy Christianity</p>
<p>The false messiah will bring the world together through peace, and possibly make it look like corruption is defeated but he will be the Antichrist</p>
<p>The Bible tells us there are hybrids again in the last days and I believe this is what the V is</p>
<p>Here is a great docu:
https://youtu.be/sOK3_gzGeP8</p>
<p>Don't trust either side :)
If this resonates with your heart, I really recommend reading the book of Matthew and John. They're short and free online in any Bible site / app</p>
<p>I was an atheist and I had an experience that showed me how real Jesus is. He's God. And what we're living is the battle for our soul described in the Bible
God bless you :)</p>

        <p>They are trying to cover up that there is no virus.  Or if there is it's probably nanotech.  If there was a real virus they wouldn't have to fake the numbers.  So they want people to believe that there is a virus.  Even if it means telling them that the government unleashed it.  Because if there isn't a virus or if it's nanotech then there is no reason for vaccines or any of the other bullshit.</p>

        <p>I thought I heard independent investigative journalist Kim Iverson mention on one of her live-streams that covid-19 was found in some sewer samples in Spain as early as March 2019. That’s a whole year earlier than when the pandemic broke out.</p>
