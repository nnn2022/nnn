<p>If this clearly was some horrifying disease like small pox or an aerosolized hemorrhagic fever, 95% of people would be begging to be vaccinated. </p>
<p>But it isn’t, not even close, so people aren’t. The educated and non-educated can rationally make the risk calculation for themselves.</p>

        <p>Thank you, friend. As someone finishing a PhD, I have highly resented the constant gaslighting that suggests I’m actually very stupid for my skepticism here. I’m literally an analytic fucking philosopher and am paid to evaluate argumentation <em>for a living</em>, but the number of music degreed Netflix bingers who have expressed doubt about my intelligence has now approached dozens. Fucking infuriating.</p>

        <p>I'm not highly educated but I've always taken an interest in logical fallacies, persuasive use of speech and the like. Does that sort of thing fall in your wheelhouse?
So many of the pro-vaccine arguments are built upon fallacious arguments that I learned to identify long before Covid. Huge red flags for me.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, man. Blatant fallacies are a bit rare in the work I encounter in a daily basis, haha, but they run absolutely and shamelessly rampant in the media and government, and thus popular consciousness. </p>
<p>It has been particularly egregious with Covid: the actual logic, per se, has been all but abandoned as a part of discourse and replaced by violently defended political presuppositions that cannot be questioned without being accused of representing evil (ad hominem is the dominant fallacy of our time). It’s not just left or right, of course, but for me, being stupid in a way that causes harm on no one but oneself is just a part of a free society and respect for human autonomy. Stupidity that is weaponized to accomplish things, that willfully harms others in its idiocy, is a different thing altogether that works toward the destruction of free societies. Keep thinking lucid and strong, man; Lord knows we need it.</p>

        <p>A lot of good points. The "appeal to authority" is another prevailing fallacy of our time, my personal favorite. With all of the scientific experts, "Dr science" Fauci, and then science itself being treated like an all-knowing deity rather than a method of understanding. </p>
<p>These people don't even realize how asinine they sound when saying you're anti science for being vaccine skeptical, while simultaneously denying all we have ever learned about natural immunity. It's insanity.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, man. Straw man and black and white are also in vogue. </p>
<p>The actual academy deals in subtlety, hesitance, patience, accountability, and caution. The “experts” the media is always referring to is essentially a replacement of when someone says “they”: “they” said this happened, or “they” have found rubbing chocolate on your skin causes immortality. Nobody knows who exactly these experts are, why their findings are not laid bare for intellectual scrutiny from all experts in the field, or whether or not they, in a very real way, <em>exist</em> in the same capacity as scientific experts should (E.g., not motivated by political ideologies or agendas). It doesn’t take a particularly brilliant person to note that any real scientist would not say gathering in houses of worship was deadly while protesting by the tens of thousands isn’t; or how masks were, then weren’t, then were effective; or, in a more general way, why this virus which was supposed to drop bodies in the streets needs constant attestation by the media in order to be maintained as threatening to the world. There is great dissonance in all of these things, and the harder the powers that be lean into “shut the hell up and trust us. We’re the experts,” the more they court anti-establishment sentiment. People aren’t nearly as stupid as their actions imply they think we are, but such a misinterpretation of humanity actually checks out for rooms which are rife with sociopaths and narcissists. </p>
<p>Sorry for the rant. Lol. But, yes: logic is still important, and nobody is ever expected to believe anything that isn’t logically sound. That, friends, is what science is about.</p>

        <p>I use the appeal to authority all teh time at work...but I do it with an authority that doesn't exist.  It is AMAZING how many people will accept it when you do that. </p>
<p>For example: try saying "I have a rule against working after 5pm" instead of "I can't work after 5pm because &lt;some family commitment&rt;", the first one a huge majority of people just accept and leave it at that, the second one while reasoned and logical will often lead to someone arguing why what you are working on is important and you should work late anyways... and then think of you as not committed etc if you don't work late.</p>

        <p>Lol. Good on you, but I fucking hate that move when it’s the actual authority using it. I used to work as a teacher and the principal would often implement policies and, when defending them, use the “sorry, those are the rules” move and I was like, DUDE. THEY’RE YOUR RULES. YOU CANNOT USE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY TO WEASEL OUT OF SOMETHING WHEN THE AUTHORITY IS YOU. Lol</p>

        <p>I would also briefly add that <em>anyone,</em> and I mean that deeply, who appeals directly to their own intelligence as a part of their argument is likely not actually very intelligent. I’m sure all of my other highly educated/intelligent friends here will confirm: hyper-intelligent, highly educated people are too busy <em>being</em> intelligent to groom and maintain an ego-dependent picture of themselves <em>as</em> intelligent (which is actually a dead giveaway for someone of average intelligence - consult the oft referenced, rarely understood Dunning-Kruger effect). The same way the strongest dude in the gym doesn’t constantly remind you how strong he is: he just is, and he is happy with that, and he couldn’t care less what you think about it.</p>

        <p>The article you posted is in reference to an older article about a different topic. Do you have any response to anything that is written in the ADE article? This is probably the most important concern about the vaccine. I actually thought you were joking when I originally replied to your comment but now I see you are serious.</p>

        <p>This is the wrong move. This is the same hackneyed bullshit that the “arguments” on Fox/CNN/Twitter start with, but it starts in a bad place and, as such, cannot but devolve into partisan bickering with no way forward. Let me explain: </p>
<p>Your position, “what are your concerns regarding the vaccine(s),” seems innocent and and collegial enough, but it actually assumes something dramatic: that <em>your</em> position is the established and rational one and that those who take issue with it must explain their skepticism to maintain their position. As such, those who cannot give a satisfying explanation to the biochemical problems with the vaccines are now disqualified from disagreeing: their lack of expertise means they never had a chance to start with, but not because this is necessarily how the argument must be framed, but because your presumedly innocent question has forced it this way. Not only is this a kind of rigging the game, it is also false. </p>
<p>The “burden of proof,” both in philosophy and law, is the obligation for a party introducing a new or controversial proposition to prove why that proposition should be accepted and decidedly <em>not</em> for those defending the standard/common proposition to prove why the new/controversial one should not be accepted. E.g.: that the moon is made of cheese instead of rock is something the one alleging the cheese argument has the burden of proving, and not that those that believe it is made of rock need to prove it is not made of cheese in order to defend their belief that it is made of rock. </p>
<p>Your argument assumes that the makeup of the vaccines, which is likely created by some of the world’s most brilliant scientists, is almost certainly perfectly fine for human use. This is likely true, though virtually nobody you argue with on Reddit will have the expertise, much less the data, to argue such a point (let’s disregard for the moment that some of the world’s leading vaccinologists have, in fact, questioned the vaccines’ makeup). If this were the primary contention, then your argument would stand solid, though not technically be considered correct until (a) all qualified parties agreed that the chemical makeup of the vaccine was perfectly fine and effective. </p>
<p>However, even granting (a), which would solve the contention (a1) that the vaccines are not chemically safe for human beings, it utterly disregards many other, and I would say more salient, aspects of the argument. In fact, it misrepresents the major concern entirely. Your proposition makes those skeptical about the vaccine sound more like</p>
<ul>
<li>I contend the new vaccines are not chemically safe for human use</li>
</ul>
<p>whereas the <em>actual</em> contention is </p>
<ul>
<li>I contend that human beings should not be expected to put this vaccine into our bodies at this time. </li>
</ul>
<p>Where your proposition and its alleged contention (a;a1) do decently well to answer the first, it does virtually nothing to answer the second. You see, the latter, more real contention is not strictly a chemical or scientific matter: it crosses into law and philosophy, human bodily autonomy and rights. The real question is not one of technical detail but of ethics: why should I put a vaccine that has not been through the same testing,  certification, and approval that is required of every other vaccine into my body? Here, the contention is (b1) why should we betray our standard operation of not using vaccines until they have been fully tested and approved over years and cannot be satisfyingly answered by your (a), the chemical makeup of the vaccines in perfectly fine. Even if (a) is true, it does not answer the question of (b1). Or, it does, but does so fallaciously: we are super smart scientists who know better than you, so betraying standard scientific and legal procedure is ok. That is a combination of fallacious reasonings, but mostly it’s an authority fallacy: I’m a super smart guy who knows this stuff really well, so do just shut up and just take the vaccine, you moron. </p>
<p>This authority fallacy, as they often do, takes the “scientists are smart” trope and overreaches into intellectual areas that scientists are not qualified to remark upon: ethics, law, philosophy, religion, etc. Scientists are qualified to do science, and any venture they make into other areas needs to be done simply as an opinion making citizen and not as an expert. I.e., scientists are not legal scholars or ethicists, and no matter how good your new drug is, it does not follow that people are obligated take it. </p>
<p>What we would need to answer (b1) is something that addressed why, in this case, employing a vaccine still in experimental trials should be taken by humanity. This is more of an ethical question, as the obvious answer is “because it saves lives,” but that is a deeply naive and presumptuous utilitarian line of reasoning. Many, many things could save lives, yet we do not force them on people. It also ignores the deeply troubling events from the past 18 months regarding government, law, media, and expertise that raise major flags against unwavering trust in institutional authorities, which is a basic issue in the history of governance and not a tin foil hatted conspiracy theory. Authorities often abuse their power; multi-billion dollar corporations are at the very least not primarily looking out for the good of humanity. The one who denies those two observations is the silly one, not the other way around. Again: the burden of proof is on the one asking the rest of us to betray standard knowledge and procedure, and even a perfectly created vaccine does not solve that issue. I hope the vaccines are perfectly safe and good for us: time will tell. But, it is an individual’s human right to not have to find that out firsthand as part of the experiment.</p>
<p>I’m assuming, from what little I’ve seen in your comments and your username, that you might be a scientist or someone minded as such. I am a philosopher and wouldn’t dare to make definitive claims about biochemistry. You are not a philosopher, lawyer, medical practitioner (or, if you are, you are likely not an academic scientist), or any of the many other qualified professions that fall into the realm of this question, and your being a “smart scientist” does not grant you the rest of the degrees at the university, regardless of whether that’s how most scientists view themselves.</p>

        <p>A very close acquaintance of mine with a PhD in Cryptology took the Astra Zeneca the minute it rolled out in his country (April 2021). The statistics shown are very well doctored that he, a highly respected mathematician in his country, fell for it. It is the collective naivety and the antiquated paradigmatic belief that scientific institutions won't get corrupted that still makes him --and a large amount of the population-- believe the official narrative.</p>

He recently got rid of his hiatus hernia during surgery and got a bit complicated due to abnormal adherences and irregularities in coagulation. He says he doesn't relate it to the jab. He didn't drop but he's willing to keep getting the jab as the variants appear. He believes so blindly in science that he literally does whatever mainstream science research tells him to do.</p>

        <p>hey man I think it's totally reasonable to question how all these radio waves are affecting us. I work with signals a lot in the army and one weird thing that I've been told is any man that works with them for long enough and accidentally ends up too close to a transmitting dish a few times will only be able to have daughters. I know it's anecdotal but I know quite a few people that this is true for one guy with 8 daughters and no sons.</p>
<p>I think it's ignorant to jump to conclusions on this stuff (specifically laser focusing on just 5G and making wild jumps in logic) but I am worried that <em>something</em> happening to us. And I really wish I could trust "the science" to honestly seek the truth on a subject like this but sadly I cannot.</p>

        <p>“Mark Steele and 5G” comes to mind if you’re questioning all of this. Radio waves in general have negative health effects on humans, especially long term use of phones and other devices, but I have found that shungite and orgonite pyramids along with a healthy diet help negate its effects. Dm me if you have any more questions your skepticism is right on the money.</p>

        <p>Eh, online survey, but n= 5 mln, so i ll bite. Phds are followed closely by high school diploma or less, so would work nicely with the meme. Those phd could be in gender studies though, or literature, and looking at the state of us higher education, the longer you stay there the more stupid you are:D. And those with phd that matters (medicine) are 96% vaxed https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-survey-shows-over-96-doctors-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19
Good meme nontheless, based on actuall studies. Chapeau bas.</p>

        <p>PhD is a general degree still, how about looking at STEM PhDs vs. all others for vaccine hesitancy?</p>
<p>Also this is a pre-print so these papers should be taken with a massive grain of salt.</p>

        <p>"The largest decrease in hesitancy between January and May by education group was in those with a high school education or less. Hesitancy held constant in the most educated group (those with a Ph.D.); by May Ph.D.’s were the most hesitant group. While vaccine hesitancy decreased across virtually all racial groups, Blacks and Pacific Islanders had the largest decreases, joining Hispanics and Asians at having lower vaccine hesitancy than whites in May."</p>
<p>While a PhD is a general degree, certain assumptions can be made about those with such a degree: high critical thinking and analytical skills, ability to read and interpret data or statistics, ability to research independently - among others. The fact that those with high school level education or lower had the largest decrease in hesitancy is also telling and makes sense in this particular context of education level.</p>

        <p>This is also rely on self-reported surveys without fact checking so not an exactly scientific method for assessing the general public.</p>
<p>On top of that once again, being educated doesn’t mean you are intelligent in making decisions in areas outside your field. Hence why it would be relevant to see a breakdown between those with a STEM PhD and those without.</p>
<p>You do not learn the same critical thinking skills and knowledge from a languages PhD as a Biochemistry PhD</p>

        <p>What? General critical thinking and research skills are ubiquitous with a PhD. Different fields have different areas of research, bias, and expertise obviously. But the comparison isn't between people with different PhDs - it's between people with PhDs and people WITHOUT PhDs. Which is why the nugget (if true) about people with high school level education levels or lower  had lower hesitancy. That's the proper comparison.</p>

        <p>That’s patently false, different PhDs develop a different set of critical thinking skills. I’ve interacted with so many various PhD students at my university and it’s quite obvious we aren’t all equal in our methods of assessment, thinking, and decision making. </p>
<p>By grouping all PhDs together you’re implying someone with a PhD in classical literature has an equal understand of vaccine science as a someone with a PhD in immunology</p>

        <p>Of course different PhDs will not be equal in their level of assessment or research skills - but they all have a baseline level of skill. And I just said that isn't even the proper comparison to make in this context. It's between people WITH PhDs and people WITHOUT PhDs - in this case people with a high school or lower level of education. Which is the entire point of this post. I'm talking about skills necessary to obtain a PhD versus skills necessary to graduate high school (or not).</p>

<p>Actually I’m far from a doomer, I think people need to stop freaking out about the delta variant cause the vaccines combat it just fine. Get herd immunity and then get rid of these public health orders and bring our normal lives back. It’s gotten pretty close back to normal where I live because the overwhelming majority of our population aren’t anti-science morons.</p>

        <p>Why not narrow it down even further? What does anyone who isn't an evolutionary virologist know? Hell, why even accept the input of people who didn't work on these particular vaccines? Anyone have the number of a Pfizer rep I could ask the really hard questions?</p>

        <p>That’s kinda my point bud, if you aren’t an expert in the field or at least informed well in the fields relevant to these vaccines you aren’t exactly going to understand or interpret the data correctly which makes falling for unsubstantiated conspiracy theories quite easy compared to those in the relevant fields</p>

        <p>That’s fallacy. First principles allows even a layman to examine these problems from a more scientific perspective that your chosen method of appealing to demagogues. The idea that very real and possible complications to which people are purposely being uninformed are just “unsubstantiated conspiracy theories” is exactly why people outside of the field need to take re-examine what they’re being told by the experts who rely on withholding information to make their arguments more compelling. We don’t need a Lysenko in public health claiming they can’t be challenged by anyone whose credentials they don’t recognize</p>

        <p>I believe scientists need to be better communicators for sure but at the same time someone who doesn’t study a field definitely will not be as well informed as someone who does and especially someone whose career is their field. If you think that’s a fallacy then don’t bother using a surgeon to remove your appendix, just do it yourself cause replying on experts are a fallacy.</p>

        <p>A surgeon is most likely to recommend surgery as a solution to everything, wouldn't you agree? This isnt appendicitis, it's not a something with one clear solution and it never was.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Why is it you only see the vaccine proffered as the solution to getting us out of lockdowns (which always necessitated a miracle treatment that didnt/doesnt exist to get us out of, and shouldn't have been used at all)? It's almost like being a specialist limits perspective and filter real world observation and studies with bias. It's almost like they do what's best for them and don't provide solutions that don't rely on their specialties.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, at the end of the day, if a specialist I supposedly cant challenge states something I can prove isn't based on first principles, basic knowledge, or collected data, such as the unvaccinated being blamed for escape variants, I wont listen to them. Suddenly the attitude has done more harm than good because their message is falling on deaf ears</p>

        <p>Not necessarily no, it’s clear you’re getting your knowledge of surgeons from Grey’s Anatomy, House, and Scrubs. Surgeons know when to perform and not perform surgery. Covid-19 definitely isn’t a simple problem, but a huge part of the solution is vaccination. Why do I only see vaccines as the way out? Because they greatly prevents the spread of the disease and reduces the toll on healthcare systems and people. We don’t have a guaranteed cure for covid-19 and preventing disease in the first place is always the better option. </p>
<p>lol so you can prove what exactly about the vaccines? And please, provide this lovely evidence</p>

        <p>I’m only claiming the obvious, that they’re no where nearly as effective as they touted, which has been proven with the data they should have collected in the first place. You’re parroting lines so much it’s absurd you accuse others of getting their options from television.</p>
<p>The people who suppress information shouldn’t be trusted when they say they’re being objective while they grossly benefit themselves and their cronies</p>
<p>Edit: frankly the track record of these experts you think aren’t subject to critique from outside their own fields is enough to show they’re more than worthy of such critique. As I said first principles goes a long, long way, and when their policies are contrary to such things there’s a big problem</p>

        <p>Wish I could provided clear US data, but the experts you claim are above reproach stopped counting breakthrough cases in the vaccinated in May. They also withheld basic information about vaccine risks and possible complications, but hey they’re wise and only want the best so it’s ok that they lie in order to keep me from making my own choices! </p>
<p>Look to the Israeli numbers coming out for evidence of rapidly diminishing vaccine efficacy. Look at the cdc shitting its pants when they tested the vaccinated in Provincetown outbreak. Look at Pfizer and moderna pushing boosters and anti-virals. Odd that repurposed antivirals were ruled out before by the same experts who think in terms of vaccinations campaigns instead of real healthcare</p>

        <p>Who mentioned isreali healthcare workers? Look at the data fro the hospitalized, it's majority vaccinated by far, and they're releasing more data constantly showing efficacy is plummeting for the first vaccinated. It's heavily implying a dangerous complication that would not exist without the vaccine being administered.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You keep on ignoring what is actually said after accepting it. You accept the CDC is manipulating data then defer to figures derived from said falsified data. It's fact that you can be hospitalized for anything and end up covid tested as a matter of course, and end up a statistic used to manipulate public opinion, whereas the vaccinated are not tested unless presenting symptoms as per CDC guidelines, and even then only the most severe cases would be tracked. I would consider accepting it instead of pretending it doesnt happen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Only 7 went to the hospital in provincetown? And how many were vaccinated? this wasnt a discussion about raw numbers, but vaccine efficacy. That outbreak showed us it simply does not reduce the viral load int he vaccinated. That the variants we all knew (supposing you're not braindead) already existed arent slowed by it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The issue here is you were sold a product that was never proven to work, and are vehemently trying to bend reality to demonstrate an efficacy that simply isnt there. You're fully convinced that they managed to create truly effective vaccines in ways that have never had prior success, against a family of virus they never had success against, the complications that ended so many other trial vaccines simply isnt a concern and never was, and the EUA to bring these to the market is just a matter of convenience. You just KNOW that given proper trials every single candidate would have passed, and why is that? It's certainly not historical observation or a detailed knowledge of the issue at hand, those would raise doubts.</p>

        <p>&rt;Well mRNA vaccines and vaccines for coronaviruses were decades in the making so with the massive financial and resource investment in them yeah it isn’t surprising effective vaccines were produced by now.</p>
<p>Decades of failure with huge financial losses to recoup. They didnt magically solve the issues, these products are only on the market due to an EUA, not proven efficacy and safety. </p>
<p>Yes, I sincerely want to prove them unsafe if that's the case. I fail to see why that's bad, as I wouldn't be making them unsafe, just demonstrating reality. You are constantly ignoring reality, I want to embrace it for what it is, and even rudimentary observation and research provides plenty of reason to pursue this cause. You refer yourself to the reasons yourself and re-frame them as positives or non-starters: decades of failure? <em>decades of study!</em> improper time devoted to ruling out catastrophic complications? <em>they had to hurry, but it's safe!</em> EUA being the only reason they're available? <em>They're just that good!</em> The vaccinated making up the majority of hospitalized when the numbers arent manipulated? <em>No worries! Small samples!</em> The majority of those in critical care in the nation that rolled out vaccines first is showing a huge drop in efficacy and maybe even ADE-type complications? <em>The numbers are small dont worry! Take your boosters!</em> A demonstrated need for companies to recoup massive financial losses in dead-end research? <em>Who'd ever lie for money?!</em></p>
<p>This is what you get when you trust expert demagoguery instead of engaging in first principles examination of the problems at hand.</p>

        <p>The ENT dr I saw recommended I have my T&amp;A removed....also recommended all 4 of my kids have theirs removed.  Why?  Because they are always enlarged and it is better to take them out!</p>
<p>....he was considered one of the top 10 ENT surgeon's in the country.  I have no doubt he was a great surgeon, but seriously if you need an obvious example in your life go ask a chiropractor if they can solve your physical ailments by aligning your back.  Im betting they can probably cure covid doing it.</p>

        <p>Except we didn't end up doing the surgery for all 5 of us based on other doctors feedback.  And my experience while anecdotal aligns with many others experience.  At some point most would consider that a trend.  If you want to be stuck on your anchoring, than others experience aren't going to matter to you, whatever.</p>

        <p>When a surgeon recommends surgery to me, without fail I will get a second opinion (from a surgeon) and the opinion of my general practitioner.  Why?  Because a surgeon will recommend surgery (to a hammer all problems are a nail)...but a second surgeon may recommend a different surgery.
