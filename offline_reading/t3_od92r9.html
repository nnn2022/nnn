    <strong>I blame this subreddit for the death of my granddad.</strong>
    <p><p>My 81 year old grandad was autistic and had adhd. Quite heavily autistic, actually, so it was very easy to give him information and have him believe it. He also loved reddit. He was quite a chill dude most of the time and he liked some of the memes on here. So when he found a post about this sub his natural instinct and impulsiveness meant he immediately went to find it. He immediately became invested and told me about how he read as far as 5 months back. Over time he started to believe that covid wasn't real. One time he went out with my grandma to go shopping as he hadnt left the house in ages due to paranoia and this sub gave him the confidence to do so. He wasnt careful at all, and a few days after he came back from his trip he got a fever and lost his taste. Obviously, this was covid. He got tested and this was the result that came back. As his state worsened due to old age, he constantly protested against my grandmas pleas to go to hospital. He was dying, yet every time his wife tried to call 111 or 999 he would smack the phone out her hands and thrash it against the floor. My grandma was miserable, my grandpa was dying. Eventually, after a door-stop visit by my grandma to my mum, an ambulance came to take him to the hospital. He protested, but was eventually ushered into the ambulance. He was immediately put onto a ventilator. He died May 29th. Please, your claims here, that are not backed up by any validated science and are merely a circle jerk of conspiracies, can damage people like my grand dad. It was a miracle for him to make it to 81 with his mental health conditions, and you all ruined it for him. Please, I am begging you, please stop. Thank you for reading.</p></p>

<p>Even if it did, if he wanted to go live life again despite the risk, that was his choice.  As an autist, it is very ableist of you to claim things like autism and adhd as invalidating a person's ability to make their own choices.  After living in fear for a year plenty of people, even neurotypical ones would rather face the storm that live in constant fear, even if it's like a 15% death risk at 80.  You are also going to be dead within a few years anyhow.  My 80 year old great aunt was taken out by a basic, run of the mill cold.  I don't think she would have appreciated if we just kept her as a prisoner for her last years to potentially give her another one.</p>
<p>Respecting the elderly also means accepting they might want to take risks that you don't approve of.  Also, autistic people are perfectly capable of making their own decisions, and if you don't think he was, then your grandmother is a rapist for taking advantage of someone who was mentally incompetent.  If he can't consent on big life decisions, he couldn't consent to sex or marriage either.</p>

<p>Sounds pretty spry for a man on his deathbed.  Maybe you should blame the doctor who put your granddad on a vent when it wasn't necessary.  He most likely developed ventilator acquired pneumonia, a hoslital indection.  Sounds like all of you ushering him to the hospital, when he didn't need to go, is what led to his death.  That's what your appeal to authority got you.  You listened to experts, but never questioned what they were saying.</p>
<p>That's if your story is even true.  Was your grandad's name Alberto Einstein?</p>

        <p>You know how I know this is fake? If your grandad really was so invested that he read back as far as 5 months worth of posts here, he wouldn't have believed covid isn't real because that's not what we're about and he would have gotten Ivermectin as soon as he got covid and he would have been fine. Your grandad, if he even exists either passed away a long time ago, is still alive or passed away recently of old age or some other thing that happens when you're old.</p>

        <p>There is no pandemic. It is all a giant scamdemic. If your grandfather did pass away, then what he had was pneumonia. Sadly, this is common to occur to people in their 80s. May he rest in peace. Wake up to the scamdemic, and don't take the poison injections. They are designed to genetically modify and eventually kill people.</p>

        <p>Bitter truth is the ventilator was primary cause of driving up mortality. Lots of nurses have blown the whistle and they saw the fratricide first hand. If they put you on a ventilator that's it, you're becoming a statistic to drive up "covid(idiot) deaths". Doctors that actually gave a damn got them started on ivermectin or hcq and azithro regimen and avoid ventilation at all costs. Both treatments have saved COUNTLESS LIVES. the vaccine, the ventilator (a huge money grift too), MIDAZOLAM ; these were used to slowly kill the frail and elderly while we we couldn't even visit to stand up for them.</p>
