    <strong>Why are we different?</strong>
    <p><p>I'd like to take a moment and discuss / dissect what forms communities like this one. Our thought processes, ideologies, against the grain mentalities, ect.  </p>
<p>One thing I have often noticed is that people who have been through immense trauma / hardship often end up on one of two extremes.</p>
<ol>
<li>An ultra realist. Your reality has been shattered by hardship, you had to face life and experience things most people don't see. Now, you view things different. Not via the lens of emotion, but through the lens of simply - what is.</li>
<li>Emotional driven. PTSD, CPTSD, BPD, the list goes on. Abandonment issues, distrust in people, ect. They end up at the other end of this spectrum and now everything is emotionally based due to being scarred.  </li>
</ol>
<p>I am the first and this is what has separated me from some people I know. They find me to be cold, too forward, a pessimist, ect. In reality it's just calling it as you see it.  </p>
<p>But now about you. Why is it that we manage to think so much differently than the masses? Surely it's not intelligence because there are plenty of highly intelligent people out there that people this. Is it ease of daily life? If it's not ruining your day to day life, they just suck it up and tune out what's really happening? Or lastly - could it be that they just really believe it and have been brainwashed.  </p>
<p>To think the way we do in this world is extraordinarily isolating and I am just trying to find out where in life our neurological paths split that lead to these 2 extremes of sheep vs. free thinkers.  </p>
<p>Also, I know the Corona freaks are frothing at the mouth to lay into us. "It's because you're low IQ and selfish! And a redneck too who voted for DRUMPF!" - so, those responses should be funny.</p></p>

        <p>We're true skeptics, no holds barred. Less susceptible (but not immune) to cognitive biases and manipulation tactics. In the case of covid, the lies are so blatant and the moral justifications so self-contradictory that only the willfully ignorant can dismiss them</p>

        <p>Personally I was raised in a staunch libertarian family &amp; was taught to distrust all government down to law enforcement. And you can be sure if I was taught to distrust the US government this much, I distrust other governments even more. So my alarm bells went off when China produced so much video and social content related to their lockdowns. I knew China only shares what they want others to see &amp; that distrust only deepened when they lifted their lockdowns &amp; suddenly foreign journalists were dispelled &amp; all content out of China ceased.</p>
<p>So you can imagine how much I thought it was bullshit when all other countries began adopting those same practices that suddenly dropped off the media as soon as the media wanted western countries to follow the same path. Then I saw how state governors went buck wild with their power and it was game over. I lived through 9/11. The government doesn’t give back what it takes so I have mentally prepared myself that I might even have to die to help take that power back from our government. America doesn’t follow Chinese bullshit and I’ll be damned if that country takes over mine by way of technocratic overreach in my lifetime or the next one. I am a skeptic through and through because I’ve never trusted the government so why would I start now?</p>

        <p>I’ve been through some stuff and my bullshit detector is good. I can tell when something is off. I have experience with narcissistic abuse and I know that people lie and have their own agendas. Also that experts can be wrong and they can be bought.</p>

        <p>Midwits are the problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9agM261CSJU&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=AuronMacIntyre">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9agM261CSJU&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=AuronMacIntyre</a></p>
<p>Those in the "university-educated" class that believe they went to university to learn to think, when, in fact, they went to finish their indoctrination process.</p>
<p>They are insecure people, smart enough to know they could achieve more if they were just, well, smart enough. </p>
<p>They inhabit the 110 -125 IQ corridor (and possibly a bit above that too) and are not only prone to groupthink but they can never admit their mistakes either, to do so would be to confess to their own mental inadequacy and that's something that the midwit fears above all.</p>
<p>Combine that with social media and you get the world's first Western "face culture". </p>
<p>Worse, all the avenues for resistance are closed. All the world's politicians appear to be collaborating on this with almost no exceptions - the UK, for example, has "lockdowns" to the right, and umm... "lockdown harder" to the left.</p>
<p>This is aided and abetted by a media class that has only recently been relevant again after being out in the cold. Covid is making trad media rich again. Why would they let it go?</p>
<p>The social media companies are also raking in the cash. So, they're modulating "the truth" to be exactly what makes them rich. </p>
<p>Academia, on the other hand, gets paid based on keeping politicians happy and appearing in the media - the final branch of potential resistance is neutered. </p>
<p>Bring all 4 together and the midwit has endless reassurance and justification that their stupidity is actually right. "Are you saying that millions of very smart midwits are wrong?" is their non-stop defense. And for any midwit reading this, yes, yes, I am. </p>
<p>This began with the ridiculous "97% of scientists say climate change is the biggest emergency of our lifetimes" (a ludicrous lie but boy did it catch on) and ended here.</p>
<p>The majority of the public is also numerically illiterate. Sure, they can do their times tables and perhaps split a bill without a calculator. But they can't review or interpret data sets - so, even if the midwit wanted to break from the herd, they lack the basic skills to read the data and realize they're being lied to. </p>
<p>This ends when people realize that the "experts" are not experts. They have no powers of accurate prediction. Their tests don't work. Their "medicine" is dodgy at best, criminal at worst. Etc. </p>
<p>My grandparents' generation would have figured this out in a week. Generation university educated midwit? They'd rather burn their own babies to stop others from getting Covid than realize their mistake.</p>

        <p>My take on it is collective intellectual laziness. Group think brought about by "some experts agree" or "researchers suggest" click bait nonsense. </p>
<p>Academia no longer teaches the fundamentals. People do not know of the trivium. There is no acquisition of true knowledge (the who,what,when,where) BEFORE coming to a firm understanding of the information and then spreading wisdom to others. Lots of people seem to let the media get away with lazy journalism that leaves out the true data and factual information but they jump right into spreading the rhetoric as if it is gospel without truly having all the information and a solid understanding of the subject matter. </p>
<p>When debate is discouraged and disallowed we have the crisis we are experiencing now in both the social and scientific setting. Research the replication crisis. Nobody wants to be wrong or even budge on a preconceived belief so they will defend positions with emotional extremes because they do not have the logical thought processes required to defend a position with only facts. Fallacies are their primary tool of communicating. </p>
<p>Cloth masks don't work. The science has proven it. Further research is not conducted on wearing cloth masks because they already know the outcome is not in their favor. They are hardly washed, constantly touched, and worn improperly. The CDC acknowledges this. Global leaders will not. Fuckery is a foot and when it is so blatantly obvious to some and completely invisible to others, you know it is a breakdown in critical thinking ability using fundamental thought processes. </p>

        <p>I'm definitely in the second category. I've been through some shit and I didn't come out of it unscathed. I have truth issues and I learned not to blindly trust people, especially people with authority. I think the major COVID doomers are pollyanna types that believe in hope and the goodness of mankind and all that bullshit. Some of them seriously believe that we should put all of our trust in Pfizer and Moderna(sp?), even though they don't have a clean track record.</p>

        <p>part two was an interesting take and I've said this about people before because people ask me how did you know that so and so was not a good person? </p>
<p>and I said because hardship makes you hypervigilant of others intentions. </p>
<p>it helps you see that people aren't mostly good. people are mostly neutral and you have a lot of people who are downright evil. when you have personal contact with the dark side of humanity you don't walk around trusting anybody, let alone authority. </p>
<p>many people would throw you under the bus or abuse you to save themselves. many people would ignore you so they dont inconvenience themselves.</p>

        <p>I find it an interesting thing as well, there must be common denominators among us skeptical and critical thinkers. I’ve noticed among my personal acquaintances that the ultra religious ones tend to be the ones all on board with what the media and government tell them. Has anyone else noticed this?</p>

        <p>As far as Christianity is concerned, most fundamental Bible believers see this entire event as more groundwork for the mark of the beast and the coming of the antichrist. The masks are viewed as a precursor to the mark (Revelation 13:16-17), and the talk of mandatory vaccination is viewed as at least the next step toward the same. </p>
<p>Moreover, the Bible is clear that Satan is "the god of this world" (2 Corinthians 4:4), and that all the kingdoms of the world are under his control (Luke 4:5-6), giving fundamental Bible believers a good foundational reason to distrust any and all governments, especially those that seek to control people.</p>
<p>The western world is replete with biblically ignorant "Christians", so it comes as no surprise that much of modern Christianity might be going along with the current narrative, but the people who actually read the Bible and know what it says--the "extreme" christians--are definitely bucking the system right now.</p>

        <p>That really makes sense, especially the part about most Christians these days not really studying the Bible. It isn’t easy to do that. So they just listen to the sermons and go from there. Thanks for your input!</p>

        <p>We're different because we're sane. Something goes off in our heads that signals to us that this is wrong and that is very lacking nowadays. I always knew that, but this virus revealed just how many crazy people there are out there, a staggering amount that was much more than I thought.</p>

        <p>I would say partly 1 &amp; partly 2. I went through 1 after some middle school bullying where I was blamed for fighting back (and nearly expelled) while my perpetrators got off scot-free &amp; received virtues awards, and the scars from the shaming I got from literally everyone around me for standing up for myself numerous times over the years led to 2. I’m deeply, profoundly angry at the world tbh &amp; ALREADY believe everyone is against me. Have been this way for a long time. These lockdowns just laid those feelings bare.</p>
