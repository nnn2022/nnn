    <strong>Big news - search Twitter for Lisa Shaw. Lots of reports of her dying from the vaccine, and the BBC covering it up because she worked for them.</strong>
    <p><p>Just search Twitter for Lisa Shaw, and look by Latest.</p>
<p>There are a lot of posts saying that she was a BBC radio presenter who had the Astra Zeneca vaccine 2 weeks ago, had a bloot clot and died.</p>
<p>That's a little bit of news, not massive news as it can happen. It's rare but can happen.</p>
<p>But the BBC are purposely not reporting it. They normally say what people's cause of death is. There are hundreds in the BBC archive when "famous" people die, and they say cancer, suicide, drug overdose, etc. Its pretty rare for them to not say.</p>
<p>In this case, they've said "short illness" and they've actually used those speech marks as well. It's clear they are purposely not saying vaccine, probably because they don't want to discourage people from getting it.</p>
<p>But that's not their job! Their job is report the news and they are purposely not doing it!</p></p>

        <p>Yep. And it amazes me the doomers don’t see a huge red flag when they us a covid death is “anyone diagnosed with covid within the last 60 days” even if they were hit by a train or blew their own brains but if you die within a day or a week of getting the vaccine, they tell us “it’s unrelated to the vaccine”.</p>
