    <strong>No other generation would have accepted this. The internet made it possible.</strong>
    <p><p>I read <a href="http://archive.is/CSCMj">this article</a> a few days ago and it really got me thinking. </p>
<p>Would the people in the 1930’s have accepted a lockdown? People were already starving. </p>
<p>1940’s? No they just lived through the Great Depression. The war was all consuming part of life and the ones at home were needed in the factories. </p>
<p>1950’s? There was the McCarthy hearings, so there was some mass hysteria going on. The majority just got their lives back from the war. Nothing was going to put that on hold! </p>
<p>1960’s? They had civil rights and Vietnam. We know they hardly paid attention to the Hong Kong flu. </p>
<p>1970’s? Recession, more civil rights, the bicentennial was huge. Disco fever was their pandemic. </p>
<p>1980’s? Our mass hysteria was nuclear war. People had to riot to get attention for AIDS help. Remember hands across America? Yuppies weren’t going to stay home from work. </p>
<p>1990’s? This one I actually think a portion would have done it. Remember “storm if the century “ in 1993? The big buzz was all the online orders LL Bean received. </p>
<p>My apologies that this is so US centric.</p></p>

        <p>We had gas lines in the 70s.  And odd/even days, according to your license plate for which days you could buy it.  Plus there was an impending ice age to worry about.  Astronomical inflation.  Enormous interest rates.  Big hole in the ozone layer.  Acid rain.  Somehow we got through it though.</p>

        <p>I don't know. I can't see the 90s doing this. We had some mild hysteria around Y2K that fizzled, but I don't remember anyone I actually knew being that worried. We had high-profile school shootings to contend with but we still went to school. There was one at a rival school a few miles up the road in the late 90s, and we had school the next day. Insane restrictions followed, but nothing really stopped.</p>
<p>And the next decade had 9/11. I went to high school as normal the next day. My parents went to work. No one knew what to expect, and obviously there were huge disruptions to life in the places that were directly attacked, but things went on pretty much everywhere else.</p>
<p>In the 80s we had the satanic panic and recovered memories popping up in the news a lot, although I mostly don't remember that because I was a little kid in the 80s. I have read about it some since then, though.</p>

        <p>1993 was 2 years before the world wide web became popular and bandwidths were finally big enough to allow for it. Most consumer internet was self contained at the time. There was Compuserve, Prodigy and America Online, and probably others. The internet at universities was different. There were networks between unis but they didn't all play nice with each other. There were formatting issues. Email had existed on this network for some time.</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree. It’s something I remember from the news. I don’t know if they were phone orders, fax orders or some other thing. It made news because it was very new. The news talked about people staying home during the blizzard and were on the Internet. It set a lot of records (not only in snowfall) of people on the Internet. The news mentioned often that LL Bean received a lot of orders for winter gear. </p>
<p>I’m from Chicago. The snow here wasn’t a blizzard. It hit the east coast very hard.</p>

        <p>Maybe my experience wasn't typical but I remember a huge amount of AIDS fear. Yes, people had to riot to get help but there was plenty of fear and panic and trying to get kids with AIDS thrown out of school, adults with AIDS getting fired from their jobs.</p>
<p>I remember the news reporting at one point that they thought you could get AIDS from your cat. We had a bunch of cats killed brutally in my hometown over that one. Then there was a summer people thought you could get it from mosquitos. That did affect summer parties and camping trips where I was. </p>
<p>I really think the only thing that kept people from panicking over AIDS and acting just like people are now with Covid-19 is that AIDS was seen as a gay pervert disease. I know that's offensive but that's how a huge majority of the general public saw it. If they saw it as something decent people could get outside of a freak occurrence, I think we would have seen the same panic we're seeing now. </p>
<p>I can't personally speak for all decades but people in the 80s were not smarter or more rational than now. I know that. The media could have easily whipped them into a frenzy exactly like what's happened today. I'd be willing to bet that could have happened at any time in human history. People have always pretty much sucked.</p>

        <p>The AIDS panic is very memorable to me as well. Unless you lived around a gay neighborhood or had a friend or family member die, it really didn’t affect you. However the media had a lot of stories of very sick men dying from it. Ryan White was all over the news and that’s probably what made regular people afraid. I’m sure local media was filled with urban legends and people’s best guesses.</p>
