    <strong>"Good morning, Redditor"</strong>
    <p><p><code>"Good morning, Redditor"</code><br>
<code>"I'm Dr. Jabberg and I'm here to administer your COVID vaccine"</code><br>
<code>"But first I have to give you a few information"</code><br>
<code>"I will not inject you parts of a virus, but genetic code to modify how cells in your body operate, don't worry, it's brand nex and innovative technology, it's the future"</code><br>
<code>"After vaccination, you will still be able to catch the virus, spread it, and die from it. You will have to still practice social distancing and wear a mask"</code><br>
<code>"Genetic and carcinogenic effects were not studied because the pharmaceutical company didn't have time"</code><br>
<code>"We don't know how long the vaccines will be effective and you may or may not need a third dose, booster shots, or a shot every year until the day you die"</code><br>
<code>"If the vaccine causes any side-effect, including bad ones or even causes death, I can't be held legally responsible, neither can the company that produced the vaccine"</code><br>
<code>"If you were to die from vaccine-related complications, your life insurance won't give any money to your family, as your contract specifically says it doesn't cover death following the use of an experimental treatment"</code><br>
<code>"The vaccine is available thanks to an emergency authorization that can be revoked at any moment"</code><br>
<code>"It used to be a big no-no to start large-scale vaccination during an epidemic but we're doing it now because we trust the experts and believe in science"</code><br>
<code>"Now, are you ready to take your jab, Redditor?"</code></p></p>
