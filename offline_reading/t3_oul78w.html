    <strong>"It is time to shift how people think about the pandemic."</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center, said he was struck by <strong>data showing that vaccinated people who became infected with delta shed just as much virus as those who were not vaccinated.</strong> The slide references an outbreak in Barnstable County, Mass., where <strong>vaccinated and unvaccinated people shed nearly identical amounts of virus.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Genetic analysis of the outbreak showed that <strong>people who were vaccinated were transmitting the virus to other vaccinated people.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;"I think <strong>the central issue is that vaccinated people are probably involved to a substantial extent in the transmission of delta,</strong>" Jeffrey Shaman, a Columbia University epidemiologist, wrote in an email after reviewing the CDC slides. "In some sense, <strong>vaccination is now about personal protection</strong> - protecting oneself against severe disease. <strong>Herd immunity is not relevant as we are seeing plenty of evidence of repeat and breakthrough infections</strong>."</p>

        <p>Two points here.</p>
<p>First,  I really want to read this paper.  It is unreviewed and unreleased. It simply "leaked".   I can't comment much until I've seen it.</p>
<p>But Second, </p>
<p>&rt; data showing that vaccinated people who became infected with delta shed just as much virus as those who were not vaccinated.</p>
<p>&rt;  people who were vaccinated were transmitting the virus to other vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest to me a totally non-creepy way that this data could have been collected?  Did they do God's own case of contact tracing and determine that people who had contracted the virus only had contact with vaccinated people or what?</p>

<p>If only people felt the same way about confirming cases of covid and vetting information about the non-vaccines, we wouldn't have destroyed our entire country and our entire world for no reason.</p>

<p>Probably the same way they collect all of their other data - throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and see what sticks.</p>
