        <p>I think more people would be open to trying to understand wtf is what if it wasn’t being shoved down peoples throats! I’m a very accepting person, mind you I walk on the straight side of the road, but when being heterosexual starts to offend people and the he she x z gets taken out of context because it changes every damn day, yeah I’m annoyed!! I’ll totally encourage someone to be themselves but you can keep your taco away from me!!</p>

<p>SCIENTISTIC CONSENSUS:</p>
<p>Also if you cant question science....any science whether it be evolution or whatever...its not science...its a belief system aka a religion. There is no such thing as scientific consensus or settled science. The definition of science  is the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. There is no such thing as settled science as it flies in the very definition of the definition of science.</p>
<p>Here’s what Michael Crichton had to say about “scientific consensus” back in 2003 when he gave a lecture at the California Institute of Technology titled “Aliens Cause Global Warming” (emphasis mine):   </p>
<p>"I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you’re being had.
Let’s be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus. There is no such thing as consensus science. If it’s consensus, it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus. Period.
In addition, let me remind you that the track record of the consensus is nothing to be proud of. Let’s review a few cases.In past centuries, the greatest killer of women was fever following childbirth. One woman in six died of this fever. In 1795, Alexander Gordon of Aberdeen suggested that the fevers were infectious processes, and he was able to cure them. The consensus said no.
In 1843, Oliver Wendell Holmes claimed puerperal fever was contagious, and presented compelling evidence. The consensus said no.
In 1849, Semmelweiss demonstrated that sanitary techniques virtually eliminated puerperal fever in hospitals under his management. The consensus said he was a Jew, ignored him, and dismissed him from his post. There was in fact no agreement on puerperal fever until the start of the twentieth century. Thus the consensus took one hundred and twenty five years to arrive at the right conclusion despite the efforts of the prominent “skeptics” around the world, skeptics who were demeaned and ignored. And despite the constant ongoing deaths of women.
There is no shortage of other examples. In the 1920s in America, tens of thousands of people, mostly poor, were dying of a disease called pellagra. The consensus of scientists said it was infectious, and what was necessary was to find the “pellagra germ.” The US government asked a brilliant young investigator, Dr. Joseph Goldberger, to find the cause. Goldberger concluded that diet was the crucial factor. The consensus remained wedded to the germ theory.
Goldberger demonstrated that he could induce the disease through diet. He demonstrated that the disease was not infectious by injecting the blood of a pellagra patient into himself, and his assistant. They and other volunteers swabbed their noses with swabs from pellagra patients, and swallowed capsules containing scabs from pellagra rashes in what were called “Goldberger’s filth parties.” Nobody contracted pellagra.
The consensus continued to disagree with him. There was, in addition, a social factor-southern States disliked the idea of poor diet as the cause, because it meant that social reform was required. They continued to deny it until the 1920s. Result-despite a twentieth century epidemic, the consensus took years to see the light.
Probably every schoolchild notices that South America and Africa seem to fit together rather snugly, and Alfred Wegener proposed, in 1912, that the continents had in fact drifted apart. The consensus sneered at continental drift for fifty years. The theory was most vigorously denied by the great names of geology-until 1961, when it began to seem as if the sea floors were spreading. The result: it took the consensus fifty years to acknowledge what any schoolchild sees.
And shall we go on? The examples can be multiplied endlessly. Jenner and smallpox, Pasteur and germ theory. Saccharine, margarine, repressed memory, fiber and colon cancer, hormone replacement therapy. The list of consensus errors goes on and on.
Finally, I would remind you to notice where the claim of consensus is invoked. Consensus is invoked only in situations where the science is not solid enough. Nobody says the consensus of scientists agrees that E=mc2. Nobody says the consensus is that the sun is 93 million miles away. It would never occur to anyone to speak that way."</p>
<p>Related: From John Kay’s 2007 op-ed “Science is the pursuit of the truth, not consensus“:</p>
<p>"The notion of a monolithic “science,” meaning what scientists say, is pernicious and the notion of “scientific consensus” actively so. The route to knowledge is transparency in disagreement and openness in debate. The route to truth is the pluralist expression of conflicting views in which, often not as quickly as we might like, good ideas drive out bad. There is no room in this process for any notion of “scientific consensus.”"</p>

        <p>FASCISM:</p>
<p>Fascism is a form of socialism. And before you say the Fascists can't be socialists because they killed commies..Socialists killing other socialists doesn't make them not socialists. Fascism is a form of national syndicalism. The ideology is an offshoot of Sorelianism...which was named after George Sorel...a syndicalist that believed in traditionalist values and was against the idea of the bourgeois democracy. Sorelianism and marxism share a central ideology...Hegelianism. Now that we have that out if the way. The only difference between fascism and communism is nationalism vs globalism. Hitler went after the commies because they reported to moscow...as a nationalist he couldn't have that as he wanted all socialists to report to Berlin.</p>
<p>There is this book called the "Doctrine of Fascism"written by Benito Mussolini and Giovanni Gentile. An exert from this book: </p>
<p>"Anti-individualistic, the Fascist conception of life 
stresses the importance of the State and accepts the 
individual only in so far as his interests coincide 
with those of the State, which stands for the 
conscience and the universal, will of man as a 
historic entity. It is opposed to classical liberalism 
which arose as a reaction to absolutism and 
exhausted its historical function when the State 
became the expression of the conscience and will of 
the people. Liberalism denied the State in the name 
of the individual; Fascism reasserts
The rights of the State as expressing the real essence 
of the individual. And if liberty is to he the attribute of 
living men and not of abstract dummies invented by 
individualistic liberalism, then Fascism stands for 
liberty, and for the only liberty worth having, the 
liberty of the State and of the individual within the 
State. The Fascist conception of the State is all 
embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values 
can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, 
Fascism, is totalitarian, and the Fascist State — a 
synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values —
interprets, develops, and potentates the whole life of a 
people.
No individuals or groups (political parties, cultural 
associations, economic unions, social classes) outside 
the State."</p>
<p>Then you have an interview with Hitler himself: The following document contains Adolf Hitler‘s explanation of the Nazi form of socialism. It comes from an interview with Hitler conducted by German-American writer and Nazi sympathiser George Sylvester Viereck. The interview appeared in Liberty magazine on July 9th 1932:</p>
<p>“‘When I take charge of Germany, I shall end tribute abroad and Bolshevism at home.’
Adolf Hitler drained his cup as if it contained not tea but the lifeblood of Bolshevism.
‘Bolshevism’, the chief of the Brown Shirts, the Fascists of Germany continued, ‘is our greatest menace. Kill Bolshevism in Germany and you restore 70 million people to power. France owes her strength not to her armies but to the forces of Bolshevism and dissension in our midst’…
I met Hitler not in his headquarters, the Brown House in Munich, but in a private home, the dwelling of a former admiral of the German Navy. We discussed the fate of Germany over the teacups.
‘Why’, I asked Hitler, ‘do you call yourself a National Socialist, since your party program is the very anthesis of that commonly accredited to Socialism?’
‘Socialism’, he retorted, putting down his cup of tea, ‘is the science of dealing with the common weal [health or well-being]. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.
‘Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality and, unlike Marxism, it is patriotic.
‘We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists. We are not internationalists. Our Socialism is national. We demand the fulfilment of the just claims of the productive classes by the State on the basis of race solidarity. To us, State and race are one…"</p>
<p>And now for the definition of socialism: The definition of socialism is  a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.  Now notice the it says means of production, distribution, and exchange...well that's an entire economy top to bottom. So is essence this is a command economy. Notice its also says regulated by the community. Now how does a community regulate things? Through government, through the state. So socialism is a government controlled economy. Even the second chapter of the communist manifesto by marx calls for an economy under the state.</p>
<p>Yes fascism is a form of socialism.  You are so ignorant of history it isn't funny.</p>

        <p>ur right.
this sub is full of people that can’t have a civil debate but think they’re right about everything.
there is nothing wrong with having a different opinion. everyone on this sub acts like they’re so rational and everyone that doesn’t attack ‘lefties’ is stupid.
there are many people that don’t want this ‘new normal’ bullshit, but we’re not all psycho doomsday preppers that can’t accept other ideas. 
this sub is nothing but a ‘conservative’ circle jerk.</p>

        <p>The perversion of language, sex, science, and fact are all a part of the “new normal”. Some see the scope smaller some see it wider. For me it’s all the same. Lies and bullshit being forced down our throats. Like the lie that trans is anything more than a weird ass kink like scat play. Scat play just isn’t socially acceptable to do in public. For now</p>
