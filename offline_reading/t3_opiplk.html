    <strong>Discussion: SARS-CoV-2 causes brain inflammation and induces Lewy body formation in macaques - which in humans leads to dementia/parkinson/alzheimers</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.23.432474v1.full.pdf</p>
<p>Hello fellow people. I've been coming back to this paper once in a while, and this seems to spell doom for humanity in a couple of decades.</p>
<p>Short version is, SARS-2 triggers ~~100%~~ 75% probability of formation of Lewy bodies in the brain, including in completely asymptomatic cases, which in turn cause dementia/parkinson/alzheimers. Given that vaccines don't actually protect from asymptomatic infection, pretty much everyone is going to be a dementia/parkinson/alzheimers patient in 20 years - especially after multiple rounds of infection.</p>
<p><strong>Can someone please lay out why this might not be the case after all?</strong></p>
<p>Some select quotes from the paper:</p>
<p>&rt;The formation of intracellular Lewy bodies was clearly shown in the midbrain region of the caudate nucleus of all infected rhesus macaques (Table 2, Fig. 3B), and in one aged cynomolgus macaque (C4), while Lewy bodies were absent in the brains of all four control animals.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;In humans, Lewy body formation is linked to the development of Parkinson’s disease or Lewy body dementia (22, 23). It has been hypothesized that certain neurotropic viruses, including MERS and SARS coronaviruses, can trigger formation of Lewy bodies and cause Parkinsonism (24-29)</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;There is a growing concern that symptomatic COVID-19 patients may suffer from long-term consequences (9, 37). In this light the finding of Lewy bodies in brains of infected macaques without overt clinical signs is intriguing. They are considered a hallmark for the development of Parkinson’s disease, or Lewy body dementia. More confirmation is required, but the observations in the translational macaque models for COVID-19 (12-14, 38, 39) can be regarded as a serious warning as they may be predictive for COVID-19-related dementia cases in humans in the future, even after an asymptomatic infection or mild disease process.</p></p>

        <p>Ok here goes:</p>
<p>1) This is not peer-reviewed. Even peer-reviewed studies are sometimes wrong or even fake. Since this hasn’t been vetted at all it is easily wrong or even completely fabricated which does happen sometimes.</p>
<p>2) The sample size only had 8 total individuals and no control. Extrapolating the entire human race from so few individuals is like saying blondes don’t exist because there aren’t any in the room you currently sit in.</p>
<p>3) “All animals showed mild to moderate disease symptoms” meaning: no asymptomatic cases in the study.</p>
<p>4) Monkeys were euthanized at six weeks so we do not know if this response is lasting or something that would heal over time.</p>
<p>5) Only 5/8 monkeys showed Lewy bodies so right over the top 38.5% showed nothing. There goes your 100% probability.</p>
<p>6) Note that all rhesus monkeys but only one of the cynomolgus macaques showed Lewy bodies. Perhaps there is a strong difference between species which would call into question the applicability of results in humans.</p>
<p>7) Detecting Lewy bodies currently requires lobotomy. As such we don’t really know if they can be reversed, naturally flare up in response to certain brain irritations, etc.</p>
<p>Don’t let fear ruin your life. They want you scared and compliant. Be strong and healthy instead.</p>

        <p>First, thank you.</p>
<p>&rt; 1) This is not peer-reviewed. Even peer-reviewed studies are sometimes wrong or even fake. Since this hasn’t been vetted at all it is easily wrong or even completely fabricated which does happen sometimes.</p>
<p>Best case scenario right here. I hope this is the case.</p>
<p>&rt;2) The sample size only had 8 total individuals and no control. Extrapolating the entire human race from so few individuals is like saying blondes don’t exist because there aren’t any in the room you currently sit in.</p>
<p>They had 4 control monkeys, actually, none of which had Lewy bodies on autopsy.</p>
<p>&rt;3) “All animals showed mild to moderate disease symptoms” meaning: no asymptomatic cases in the study.</p>
<p>I guess that depends how you define asymptomatic. The definition of asymptomatic has been muddied quite a bit recently.</p>
<p>&rt;4) Monkeys were euthanized at six weeks so we do not know if this response is lasting or something that would heal over time.</p>
<p>I am under the impression that Lewy bodies are prion-like, and once they are there, they will keep multiplying until death. Is that not correct?</p>
<p>&rt;5) Only 5/8 monkeys showed Lewy bodies so right over the top 38.5% showed nothing. There goes your 100% probability.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Re-checking the paper, Table 2 shows that R1-4, and C4-5 all got Lewy bodies. Only C1 and C2 did not get Lewy bodies - which is something I missed, so thank you for pointing that out.</p>
<p>&rt;6) Note that all rhesus monkeys but only one of the cynomolgus macaques showed Lewy bodies. Perhaps there is a strong difference between species which would call into question the applicability of results in humans.</p>
<p>Agreed. Are there autopsies performed on humans who died of/with covid? Did anyone ever look for Lewy bodies in their brains? This would be a great study to pursue.</p>
<p>&rt;7) Detecting Lewy bodies currently requires lobotomy. As such we don’t really know if they can be reversed, naturally flare up in response to certain brain irritations, etc.</p>
<p>Exactly - not quite ethical to perform on live humans. However - we do have lots of dead humans that we could check for Lewy bodies.</p>
<p>&rt;Don’t let fear ruin your life. They want you scared and compliant. Be strong and healthy instead.</p>
<p>They do want us scared and compliant. However, MSM is not peddling this study in the slightest, and why would they? They can't offer a solution to have people run to daddy government.</p>

        <p>2) Just went back and searched for “control” and saw that they had six rhesus monkeys as a control. This makes the control group non-representative of the group being studied since the control only represents one species but ok. My bad there.... really wish this was setup in a more typical manner so that I could see the controls and protocol more clearly spelled out.</p>
<p>3) As asymptomatic goes, it surely has been muddied but by definition asymptomatic means without symptoms. If the monkeys had mild to moderate symptoms they were by definition not asymptomatic. Words have precise technical meanings to avoid confusion such as this. It’s a poor choice to conflate asymptotic (literally without symptoms) with mild symptoms and vice versa.</p>
<p>4) That <em>could</em> be right. The only information I could find related to Lewy body dementia which is currently separated from Parkinson’s based on order of symptom appearance it seems. Researchers are looking for new ways to detect Lewy bodies which could help us understand more in the future. Based off what I saw it seems that the only way to know if Lewy bodies are present is to check the brain after death. That is the reason I suggest there could be potential reversibility or other factors. We simply don’t know the full story with current tools unless we start killing healthy people and examining their brains.</p>
<p>5) I believe it was only C4 actually. Table 1 Fig. 1 describes C1 and C2 as having hyper metabolism in the pituitary but there is no mention of Lewy bodies being found. If you scroll under Fig. 3 towards the end it states:
&rt; The formation of intracellular Lewy bodies was clearly shown in the midbrain region of the caudate nucleus of all infected rhesus macaques (Table 2, Fig. 3B), and in one aged cynomolgus macaque (C4), while Lewy bodies were absent in the brains of all four control animals.</p>
<p>Which begs the question as to whether or not aging played a role in the Lewy bodies found in the one cynomolgus macaque. Also... it makes me wonder what happened to the other two control monkeys?</p>
<p>Additionally, the researchers are a bit disingenuous when discussing the increased pituitary uptake in the infected monkeys. They dismiss the notion that it could result from an immune response increasing cortisol as this has not been documented in Covid-19 cases. That might be true but it’s also known that respiratory infections increase cortisol in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.00485/full?utm_source=Email_to_authors_&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&amp;utm_campaign=Email_publication&amp;field=&amp;journalName=Frontiers_in_Veterinary_Science&amp;id=548361">primates</a> so it’s kinda misleading to pretend this isn’t expected. It’s also somewhat dishonest to fail to mention that SARS-CoV is known to manipulate the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12020-020-02325-1">cortisol stress response.</a>. Since covid’s family has a habit of mimicking ACTH which tricks your body into filling the cortisol immune response.... well it just seems obvious that cortisol production would rise at least until the immune system was able to start churning out antibodies. Plus let’s not forget that being a sick is stressful and likely increases cortisol all by itself.</p>

        <p>My internal dialogue after reading this:</p>
<p>- Beware the man of one ~~book~~ study.</p>
<p>- But if the virus, and the vaccines both give Alzheimer's, it's such a coincidence that FDA has just approved the controversial Alzheimer drug. </p>
<p>- There's no coincidence Evey, just the illusion of coincidence.</p>

        <p>I think a big problem with this pandemic is most people, including myself, aren't very well educated on infections and viruses. </p>
<p>From how I understand it now, this happens with all viruses and we don't know the long term effects and won't for a while. </p>
<p>I've seen people on here say the vaccines cause this too and yes it's due to the body's immune response but it's no different to getting it from catching Covid either. </p>
<p>Either way, it's not going to be avoidable and is likely a risk for everyone over time.</p>

        <p>This paper did not determine the exact mechanism of trigger formation of Lewy bodies, just the fact that they are formed.</p>
<p>It could be the spike protein itself, or it could be something else - but that's largely moot because current vaccines do not protect from infection, they merely eases symptoms.</p>
<p>Monkeys are expensive (and there is actually a shortage of them right now), and this paper obviously doesn't have big pharma financing behind it.</p>

        <p>Granted, they had limited numbers of monkeys to test on. But 100% of the infected group had Lewy bodies in their brain upon autopsy, contrasted with 0% of the control group having them.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, cases of neurological damage are starting to come to light as a result of the vaccine.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, vaccine does not protect from infection, merely helps with hospitalization, and even that's a maybe. This isn't about the vaccine, as with or without you're still getting infected with wild (feral?) virus.</p>
