    <strong>Can someone explain long term effects of the virus and the vaxxine</strong>
    <p><p>What I know up until now about this topic:
- apparently the main dangerous symptom of covid is cloggage in arteries and (possibly) gangrenes due to vasoconstriction
- mRNA method has not been used before and apparently there are concernes it might influence DNA somehow (although we learned that RNA affects ribosomes and not the core of a cell)
- and ofc that vaxxine can cause similar symtoms to the virus itself.</p>
<p>I started hearing about these "long term effects" of these 2 and I'd appreciate it if someone who is more educated on this topic could explain if such effects exist and what they are.</p></p>

        <p>How can we know the long term effects of either when neither has been around long enough for anyone to have even HAD it long term? </p>
<p>This is why drug testing is (usually) a long term process.  It takes time to find out if there are long term effects.  There is simply no other way to know what will happen in 3 years than to wait 3 years.</p>

        <p>I think that at this point any talk about long-term-effects is mostly just speculation.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean that there's no credibility to the speculation. Some of the theories about long-term-effects come with an explanation of the mechanism of how the long-term-effects could be caused.</p>
<p>Without the right tools to verify it and without the experience of someone working in the field, I have a hard time judging whether an explanation of a mechanism sounds valid or not.</p>
<p>However, the ways in which Dr. Sucharidt Bhakdi and Dr. Charles Hoffe explain the mechanisms of potential long-term-vaccine-side-effects sound kinda plausible to me.</p>
<p>But still: Only time will be able to tell if they are actually correct.</p>

        <p>I don't know if they have effects on DNA. It might be as it might not.</p>
<p>I believe however that they've made a terrible mistake by choosing the spike protein for the antibody reaction. This is the autopsy report of a deceased man after the vaccination. They found spike proteins in all the examined organs: lungs, brain, heart and so on:</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8051011/</p>
<p>At best, this vaccine exposes the injected to the same risks of covid, at worst, it's a ticking bomb for an epochal disaster, far worse than the virus itself. The clues are all around:</p>

<p>https://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953-6205(21)00142-4/fulltext</p>
<p>https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318902</p>
<p>Also, it's not a secret that vaccine adverse reactions are myocarditis and blood clots that lead to heart failures and aneurysms.. how is it possible since there's not even a virus in it?</p>
<p>Doesn't all this make ring a bell?</p>
<p>About covid symptoms, it is fair to assume that if the protein is harmful, then it is harmful in the virus too.</p>
<p>I think the cure is worse than the disease, therefore I choose the virus (until better and safer drugs will be out) because at least I might have a chance to get a mild exposition, just enough to have an antibody response but not to get the worst symptoms, or even to not get it at all.</p>

        <p>The DNA thing shouldn't happen according to many sources I found because RNA should only be able to affect ribosomes to produce stuff not the core. The reason I still took it as a possibility is because our chemistry professor seems to believe mRNA is dangerous for that reason (but take in account he is usually slightly peculiar).</p>
<p>Btw, do you believe vasodilators could be used to treat symptoms caused by spike protein?</p>

        <p>I have noticed a lot of what I suffered through when I was sick these vaccinated people are getting but worse. It seems to be mostly the spike protein that's doing a lot of the damage and now these vaccinated people are creating their own spike proteins. </p>
<p>The only lasting effect I have noticed is that my joints (knees and hips) still hurt a year later.</p>
