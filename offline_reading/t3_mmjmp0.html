        <p>Video description:</p>
<p>&rt; A large portion of the U.S. population still doesn’t want to get the new Covid vaccine, but they might not have a choice. Powers at the federal and state level, not to mention the legal rights granted to employers under U.S. labor law, may make it impossible for Americans to escape inoculation against the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>I'm amazed they allowed voting and comments on the video.</p>
<p>500k views as of 9 PM Pacific on April 7, 2021.</p>
<p>7,000 downvotes. 10,813+ comments.</p>
<p>A selection of the top comments (who wants to guess when they and the downvotes will be be hidden/erased?):</p>
<p>&rt;“Imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be threatened to take it for a disease so deadly you have to be tested to know you have it!“<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The more they try to enforce it the more resistance they will meet...naturally<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Thomas jefferson: "If a law is unjust, a man is not only right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;My mothers arm went numb after her first shot and she refuses to get second. A guys at works wife lost all her hair ....? Like are we just not hearing about some of these side effects cause they are forcing this on us.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;From the vaccine consent form: "I understand that the long-term side effects or complications of this vaccine are not known at this time."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I was thinking about not getting it. But now that it’s being forced. I’m definitely NOT getting it.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The fact that they’re even considering giving this out to children who are not even affected is incredibly disturbing. These people are so crooked.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“If you don’t feel like you’re going insane, it’s because you already have” - AA<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I truly cannot believe that this is the world that I am stuck in.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This is insanity! The battle of good vs evil  has begun...doesn’t matter the race, colour or creed it’s either your on the side of good or evil.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There are demons disguised as people among us.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I’ve spent the last 5 years fighting to reverse years of damage by over a decade of pharmaceutical use; I will NOT take this jab willingly. I can’t understand why a 95% survival rate justifies the risk. God help us all!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If they try to force people to get the shot is against our contrition. Or will have a civil war on their hands.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;An employer requiring a vaccine for employees as a "selling point" is just saying "I'm willing to risk your life for a few dollars".<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Revelation 13:17a “And no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Soo... she got fired from her job because she didn't want to take a vaccine that is still in phase 3 trial. The land of the free etc.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;News flash folks, those in power do not have your best interests at heart.yall better wake! We are in critical times<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Vaccine Passport is the Mark of the Beast Beta Stage</p>

<p>"The vaccine passports doesn't mean we're going to force people to take it, anyone who says otherwise is paranoid"</p>
<p>"Ok, so we will force you to take it but..."</p>

        <p>More comments on the video:</p>
<p>&rt;Get a place ready at FEMA Camp for me then. I certainly don't say that flippantly behind a keyboard and no experience. I can't allow coercion or duress to pressure me to go against my conscience. I made a terrible error in going to a cult for several years and I vowed to never be compelled, threatened or pressed into subjection by someone else's moral standards ever again. I can't waver or it will crush my spiritual and emotional compass to make independent decisions and choices. My only fear is to give that precious gift of my innate and inherent birthright over to another. That to me would be the ultimate definition of slavery. We're not chattel unless we can be brainwashed into believing we are. That is the danger we face worldwide if we chose not to have perception but to be willingly ignorant about our freewill choice.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I don't give a damn about going to concerts, movie theaters, etc. vs. not taking a vaccine<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Anything this political is a red flag for me! This whole affair feels like a worldwide military exercise. I ain't drinking the cool aide!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;So deadly everyone I know who has had it, including those immunosuppressed have had zero symptoms. It was the vaccine they had which has made them really ill!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Evil operates with fear and torment. Who else does, oh ...our loving care-takers, the Governments<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I'll fight with whatever I have, and plan to take this to the next world if I must.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;They're telling you, quite blank, they don't care about what you think.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Facebook has been removing support groups for people who have been having side effects.  Typically, people who die after the shots, their deaths are labeled as "inconclusive".<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Mainstream media and social media refuse to allow the FACTS about side effects and deaths from these "vaccines". I tried to share a news story about a 39-year-old woman in Idaho (may have been Ohio) dying about a day after she got hers and Facebook wouldn't allow it! I've tried to share with others about horrible side effects and deaths and they won't let me. It's insane!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;First let me say forget about the"vaccine". Not taking it. I went thru the whole year as an essential worker. Sometimes didn't wear a mask. No virus. The government is doing something shady I just don't know what it is but miss me with this BS vaccine<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Anything this political is a red flag for me! This whole affair feels like a worldwide military exercise. I ain't drinking the Kool-Aid!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Alternative title: “Why we’re telling you, little idiot people, that you will be forced against your will into taking a drug that you do not want to take.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Covid passport was a conspiracy theory 11 months ago. Now look<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It is a “Human Right Violation” to force someone to take chemicals in their body by restricting freedom!!!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I will never get vaxed. My body, my choice.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If they try to inject me with this vaccine I'm gonna inject them with lead<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It’s really as if they want people to start rebelling, especially against the old “order” so they can offer a “new” one. So much ridiculous confusion constantly. All I can say is don’t let it ruffle up your emotions. Seek God<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Have anaphylaxis. Have a list of allergies. My doctor, thank God, says no way, Jose. And if she would not have said that, I would have said that on my own. My coworker's mom took the first shot to Pfizer and within 30 seconds after had a code blue heart attack. They revived her. But she was in a coma for 2 weeks as her kidneys and liver began to fail. Somehow she survived. But when she woke up, she showed signs of mid-stage Alzheimer's.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It's easier to fool people than to convince them they have been fooled!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This is such an f'ed up situation man forced to wear a mask forced to take a vaccine when there's nothing wrong with me or my family were all perfectly fine and have been healthy for years THIS SUCKS<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“Remember: you’re not free till we tell you you’re free.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I’m willing to die for my right to refuse, are you willing to die trying to make me???<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;According to the Nuremberg Code, you cannot be forced to take a vaccine that is an experimental state... Now how this works then? If I get forced to take it or else I will be fired, can I sue the company?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Don\t let them fool you, they are going to cure us to death. When they are done with this bioweapon, they can stamp another one.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Suddenly pharmaceutical companies that profit endlessly off the death and suffering of others, and who have lots of blood on their own hands, care about you.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I live in NH. my doctor tried talking me into the vaccine today. I’m pregnant... they have no studies on how that would affect the baby or me 😂 she goes well we think it’s safe. y’all also thought the polio vaccine was safe and look how that worked out.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Why should we force people to protect themselves from others who don’t want the vaccine. What happened to our body, our choice! What happened to not letting the govt. getting between me and my doctor?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"You can be forced" just try it then that's all I got to say<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This is honestly terrifying that they can make you put something in your body that took less than a year to develop and that we have no real hard facts on how it affects the human body<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Are these 🐑 lining up for the slaughter or 🐐 I have never 🙈 seen anything like this.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Keep pushing the people, I can't wait to watch the fireworks<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I said no to forced hand sanitizer at the eye doctor’s Office and the front desk chicks looked at each other like I had just pulled a gun out 😂 Fun times we live in<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;What about people with autoimmune conditions and reactions to previous vaccines? Are we banned from society?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; I'll believe this is an actual pandemic when they stop stores from selling cigarettes and alcohol. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; I will die on my feet before I live on my knees.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; "The welfare of the people will always be the alibi of tyrants, and it provides the further advantage of giving the servants of tyranny a good conscience" Albert Camus <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; The world has gone absolutely bonkers <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; Sounds like zillions of lawsuits for crimes against humanity. I'll take a bullet instead. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; Many of us know that the vaccine contains fetal tissue taken from aborted children in the 1980s. Additionally there's Mercury as well as formaldehyde in the vaccine. Is this something you want to put in your body? <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; My body my choice! I ain't taking that garbage and risk getting bell's palsy! <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; A great way to get people to not want something is to tell them they have to have it. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; "The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the Government and I'm here to help." Ronald Regan <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; Why in the world would someone thumb this video up? You all like the government forcing their will unto people? Yeah cuz that usually ends well in history. Also what happened to my body my choice? Now forced penetration is hip? Y’all are confusing af. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; How can you be forced by an employer to take part in a medical experiment, an  employer can't give you informed consent and is not your personal doctor.  Why would they make it mandatory to take an experimental vaccine for something that is over 99% survivable. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; My friend got the vaccine and now he's sick. He's just not himself. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; As my grandfather used to say to me years and years ago about him being told the Germans were going to over-run his position in 1944, He said, "Tell them to pack a lunch"!</p>

        <p>First of all, none of these shots are FDA approved, they are all under Emergency Use Authorization.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title21/html/USCODE-2011-title21-chap9.htm">FDA 21 US Code 360bbb-3 - "Authorization for Medical Products for Use in Emergencies</a> the administration of any product authorized for emergency use MUST be voluntary.</p>
<p>Under "Required Conditions", it states that;</p>
<p><em>"(ii) Appropriate conditions designed to ensure that individuals to whom the product is administered are informed-</em></p>
<p><em>...
(III) <strong>of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product,</strong> of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks."</em></p>
<p>CNBC is cheering on a violation of the Nuremburg code. They must not realize that administering such an inoculation is punishable by law. At what point does ignorance become complicit?</p>
