        <p>That's even worse.  A debt-slave slave.</p>
<p>Maybe the universities can just put ankle bracelets on the students like those for house arrest, or maybe shock collars.  Monitor their temperatures, their location, their blood alcohol level, their proximity to others, all of that.  For their "safety" in this "unprecedented pandemic" time.</p>

        <p>so called formal 'higher education' destroyed my sons' ability to think critically about anything, beginning with their majors. one chose 'acoustic engineering', the other 'creative writing'</p>
<p>i myself have no 'higher education' at all. i barely made it out of grade school, it took me 7 schools to get from 4th grade to 8th, heh, expelled from 5 of them. it took another 3 until i was expelled 1/2 way through junior year of h.s. </p>

        <p>&rt; "Higher education" has little to do with intelligence and knowledge. </p>
<p>heh, i am well aware. i was fortunate to have been taught from the earliest age 'how' to learn about anything, not 'what' to learn. </p>
<p>my early education was from a totally unique private school, that employed a man named mortimer adler's philosophical approach to 'education'. this man's existence has had a profound effect on my life, i would not be who i am, had he not existed. look him up, good stuff.</p>
<p>taught to read using phonics (rather than whole word), by 3rd grade i was able read and comprehend material at the then college level. </p>
<p>once i was subjected to catholic school in the 4th grade, forget it, 'school' lost any and all appeal to me. i was never 'socialized'</p>
<p>that said, i am, in fact, well 'educated' in every subject that interests me and i do not care what any 'pompous ass' tells me, they can all fuck right off. lol</p>
<p>cheers! resist the tyranny! the worst is yet to come, be strong!</p>

        <p>Funny you mentioned him.  I've in the past talked about him with my daughter who wanted to be and now is an education major.  In the classes she assists in, she's upset that her students don't know how to learn, that it's mostly rote.  She was brought up with a much "freer" sense of "education", one which allowed her to explore areas of interest to her.  I suspect she may drop education for something less structured once she get a load of all the parameters and restrictions she'll be confined within.  Or worse, she'll acclimate.</p>

        <p>i'm surprised anyone else has heard of him. i myself had not until i was in my 30s, and i went to a school named for him.</p>
<p>i doubt your daughter will find her major in 'education' satisfying or fulfilling as the role of teachers in today's system is that of indoctrinators of a (marxist) curriculum that is not their own, rather then 'liberal' educators of free men and woman. the emphasis is on the what, not the how or why, and is geared to the lowest common denominator</p>
<p>the word educate has 2 latin roots with completely different meanings. 'educare' meaning to mold or train, and 'edecere' meaning to lead or draw out (from within)</p>
<p>pre-coronahoax, i would have wished your daughter to have 15 babies, then raise and 'educate' them properly with her husband. :) today, i would not wish the oncoming 'social' slavery on anyone, least of all children.</p>

        <p>When I read your explanation of "educate" and its roots my first thought was it's like we're long lost siblings or something.  I do that with my daughter.  I also encourage her to read the dictionary so that she can learn not only meanings but etymology because I'm a firm believer that an expanded vocabulary can expand thought. Plus I love learning and want her to love it too!</p>
<p>I'm not sure what direction she'll take.  On one hand she's very good at following directions and playing the game, whether it's in school, sports, or her part time job with children.  One the other hand, she is becoming more aware that if she follows this career choice, she will have to give up the autonomy she has known her whole life.  She was very frustrated this summer with the restrictions imposed on what she could do with the children, things like which books she could read to them or what types of movies to watch in their free time. Add in the coronavirus measures and she literally cried one day when telling me that she didn't think she could teach in that environment.</p>
<p>I used to be very good at playing the game too, but then I hit my bullshit threshold and couldn't do it anymore.  Now I'm back to autonomy and won't let it go again.</p>

It claim funeral homes were over ran in China.
Videos like this caused the world's reaction to the virus.
Now China claims they have the lowest cases.</p>

        <p>Isn't it maddening how no one has any understanding of basic math and proportions anymore? If they did, they would have logically deduced that China is bullshitting to hell. China claimed they had less than 4000 deaths from covid (all or most in Wuhan/Hubei province), yet at the same time, they put out complete bs like this video about "funeral homes on brink of collapse, bodies in the street". Now any first grader can look at this at say "that makes absolutely no sense". Wuhan is a city of over 10 million people, so how the hell can 3000 people dying over a course of a couple of months be "overwhelming" anything? But apparently, we've entered some bizarre clown world where no one understands what numbers and proportions mean anymore. It's like I died in early March and woke up in a hellish Jacob's Ladder nightmare scenario. Nothing makes any sense anymore, and the way the world is behaving is psychotic. China must be declaring victory at how easy and quick it was to destroy the West. Gee, I wonder why China is the only place that doesn't have this whole "muh pandemic" problem. And it certainly isn't the inane "we locked down early and we locked down right" bullshit that they fed this dumbass  world. These four words sum it all perfectly: THE ART OF WAR.</p>
