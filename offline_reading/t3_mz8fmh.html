        <p>For those who don’t remember, <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nme.com/news/music/kanye-west-clarifies-controversial-slavery-comments-2306479%3famp">in 2018 he said</a>:</p>
<p><em>“When you hear about slavery for 400 years, for 400 years?! That sounds like a choice,” he argued. “We’re mentally imprisoned.”</em></p>
<p>He elaborated by saying:</p>
<p><em>“We need to have open discussions and ideas on unsettled pain… to make myself clear. Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will”.</em>
...
<em>“My point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved,”</em>
...
<em>“They cut out our tongues so we couldn’t communicate to each other. I will not allow my tongue to be cut… they hung the most powerful in order to force fear into the others… they can no longer stop our voice”.</em></p>
<p>Of course the media, rather than refuting the point, tried to destroy him by acting offended, taking his quote out of context, and launching ad hominem attacks on his weight, mental health, and opioid problems</p>

<p>yeah amazingly, from what I experienced so far... most blacks aren't "liberal" in a political way (rather pretty relaxed like in "you do you"), but many of them are straight up patriots, some republicans and even to be called 'right wingers' in many cases. Why not? All we have to do is, accept them as human beings and don't dehumanize them by looking down to them, belittering them for "being black" like they were born victims without an own opinion and all.</p>

Luckily I am a girl, people tend to open up a lot easier.

        <p>There really isn't bigger fish to fry. These are no longer petty disputes, leftists are at war with our civil liberties and are advocating for big government and their best friends (big corporations) to help them with that goal. Whether they realize it or not, this is what leftists are fighting for. So spare me with the "the elite are just trying to divide us" crap. We already are divided and one side is clearly fighting for freedom while another is fighting for tyranny.</p>

        <p>I though leftists were communists? You understand that mega-corporations don't like that? You can't be stupid enough to think honestly think these multi-million and trillion dollar corporations prefer the heavy regulations and taxes that are laid down and cheered on by the left over the "hand's off" and zero-responsibility outlook of the right. Do you know how corporations work? Why would they want to make less money? Ask yourself these questions. How are "big-corporations" the friends of the people that want them to make less money and want them to adhere to more rules?</p>

        <p>I think people confuse liberals with leftists. But the argument is that corporations like big government and regulation because they have the money to either A) pay these politicians off and thus end up with loopholes or subsidies or B) destroy small business who can’t afford the taxes/regulatory fees and thus make us all dependent on them. </p>
<p>The problem is the liberals Ive noticed in my small city don’t counter the leftists and rather let them run roughshod through policy and the like.</p>

<p>They still get more money off of a market with no regulations and lower taxes. When you are racking in billions a year any percentage difference in tax is huge.</p>
<p>&rt;B) destroy small business who can’t afford the taxes/regulatory fees and thus make us all dependent on them. </p>
<p>Once again, they don't need the government for this, regulation/taxes are hardly going to be what breaks a startup business when trillion dollar organizations are already in the field, if they see competition they just buy them, or spend their practically limitless resources copying whatever is making the competitor able to compete.</p>

<p>The mean of production don't need to be seized, the companies need to be split up and taxed like hell, anti-trust laws have laid dormant for long enough, and have no teeth, these corporations know that. Policy is the only way that will change.</p>
<p>My only point is that it makes no sense for the corporations to be allies with the " communist left". They would much prefer the Right sides "freemarket" approach so that they can violate human rights without challenge.</p>

        <p>I think both of you are right, to some extent. The megacorps know where the Overton window lies and play into it hard. They do things like mass produce Che Guevara t-shirts because “revolutionaries” will buy them and not see the irony. They’re selling people their own ideologies. They don’t want a communist left to be in power, but they want to profit off the people who do. So they show public support for it, slowly turning public opinion until you have the shitshow we have now.</p>

        <p>I was very surprised to see jojo get so many fewers votes than gary. I'd like to think it was because of vote rigging, but I think most likely it was due to heavy fear mongering from both sides that convinced people to vote for "lesser of two evils".

        <p>I've still never voted. But I intend to get involved this time to back Dave Smith and help get him in as the lib party presidential candidate. If anyone can get the message out, it's him, he is Hella based. I even joined the LP officially last month because of him because finally, there is a chance now to make the LP into something not totally pathetic!</p>

        <p>you're probably on the wrong sub. r slash libertarian was literally taken over by marxists. the actual libertarian sub where actual libertarians congregate is r/GoldandBlack</p>
<p>if you need to ask questions to libertarians and want good faith, cogent and educated responses, that's the place you need to be.</p>
<p>it is sadly true that the vast majority of those who claim the libertarian label have a poor understanding of the underlying principles of libertarianism (which are actually incredibly simple and straightforward, which makes it kind of sad). </p>

        <p>I used to think I was more liberal. As I learn more about conservatives (I'm Canadian but basically republicans), I realize liberal just means someone with no experience but plenty of education and safe spaces. Whereas conservatives just stick their fingers in their ears and get it done. Neither approach is good lol.      </p>
<p>I think part of the issue is with only two parties, you have to group everyone as either A or B. Finding two people who agree with each other on everything would be difficult enough, let alone getting half of America on the same page</p>

        <p>In Canada, we have liberals, conservatives, and New Democratic Party as our major parties, with power mostly being tossed between libs and cons. NDP is smaller but has held office a few times I think historically. There's also two smaller parties, green party and bloc Quebecois. They've never held power, but get a few seats every year.      </p>
<p>My point I'm getting to with this though, is that having a third party is useful for political theatre, but in practice doesn't change a whole lot. The system is broken. The majority of Canadians refuse to vote for anyone but lib or cons because it would be "throwing their vote away." Even if they politically align with one of the other parties way more. It's stupid. Having more parties is a bandaid on a missing limb imo</p>

<p>Edit: Additionally, racial issues have never stopped, racial Injustice has permeated throughout America for centuries and saying people are "too focused" on it is absurd. People are not focused enough on it, there will never be enough focus on these injustices until they are wiped out.</p>

        <p>Solzhenitsyn made a fairly similar point about the Soviet Union gulags I recall—people tiptoeing down the stairs when arrested to avoid disturbing their neighbours. And I think a similar point was even made about Jews going to concentration camps: just going passively, little to no fighting back. </p>

<p>A. Many of them did not know where they were going.</p>
<p>B. if they fought back, them, their children, their wives, mothers, father's, siblings, could and would be brutally murdered or tortured as punishment.</p>
<p>Holy shit you guys are downright fucking idiots, it's almost funny that you guys think if you were in their situation you would do anything other than nod your head and follow the line, life isn't a movie, when it's you and your loved ones life's on the line, 9 times out of 10 your going to comply, because that is what is more likely to keep you alive longer.</p>

        <p>Thanks for proving to us that you have zero concept of how guns work.</p>
<p>https://www.gunowners.org/sk0802htm/</p>
<p>This has a well cited list describing how guns save lives every day. Your arguments for proper gun reform are inherently stupid, because surprise surprise, criminals who take lives don't follow them anyways.</p>
<p>And this is easily relevant to the conversation, because one of the first things the Nazis did was to disarm the people so they could not defend themselves. Every nation in history that had disarmed it's people has typically followed with a authoritarian regime, often times killing its own people in mass. The only way to prevent that long term is to maintain an armed populace that keeps the government in check.</p>
<p>But I'm sure that papa government will treat you well if you keep complying, maybe they won't Ruby Ridge or Waco your ass, maybe they will. Depends on how they feel tomorrow.</p>

        <p>The problem was that, even in his extended quote, he's ignorant of both history and the complexities of the slaves' experiences. They did have superior numbers. but they never had superior force. Even still, there were constant slave uprisings, many of them quite violent, but they were always eventually quelled by gruesome means. Wives and children were often held separately to dissuade activists from organizing. Examples were made, loved ones tortured.</p>
<p>Kanye can fairly talk about the mind of a slave in a theoretical sense, but to criticize actual slaves for being cruelly brutalized and broken by a system that actively negated any recourse; to chastise their legacy for not somehow overcoming nearly an entire nation that saw them as somewhat or fully less than human is to minimize and devalue their experiences and to cast aspersions against their character.</p>
<p>THAT is why he was ridiculed.</p>

        <p>He wasn’t criticizing the slaves. His point is to say that there’s a strong element of psychological slavery that accompanies the physical, and that in many cases the psychological aspect can be more powerful. Splitting up families in order to weaken the family is one of those things. As he, Candace, and others have <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/06/12/to-truly-reduce-racial-disparities-we-must-acknowledge-black-fathers-matter/">pointed out</a>, fatherlessness for black people now is worse than it was during Jim Crow. That might not have the gruesome effect of the things you mentioned, but it has tremendous consequences for black people in America today. Rather than try to counter that point in a reasonable manner, the media chooses to smear black conservatives as crazy, stupid, or somehow white supremecists.</p>

        <p>So it was a choice when african people were thrown in cages to fester with their own piss and shit, hipped off to a foreign land thousands of miles away where they were exposed to diseases that killed them by the thousands them, beaten and tortured nearly daily for anything remotely opposing white people. </p>
<p>All of that was a choice? Because if you honestly think if you were born into the situation that they were, that you would do anything other than live and die a slave because any other option resulted in you mind, body, and loved ones being brutalized, then you are nothing short of a moron.</p>

        <p>Oh you just don't understand how masks work, I see. Well you see, when you breathe, you release LITTLE ITTY BITTY particles that you can't even see! When you wear a mask, those particles get stopped, so if they carry disease, they won't spread! Now it's not 100% effective, but neither are condoms!</p>

        <p>The more I think about it, that just doesn't seem sanitary. Breathing your warm, moist breath into the same strip of cloth for 8+ hours sounds like a terrible thing to do. (germs and bacteria thrive in warm, moist areas). And I'm saying this as someone who has done it. Chances are you have touched the mask with your hands multiple times throughout the day without even realizing it (subconsciously). Adjusting it, scratching an itch, taking it on/off to eat or get a drink of water, etc... Not to mention if you have coughed, sneezed or belched into it. And then, let's be fully 100% honest, most people don't wash their mask every single day. I'm sure some do, but I'd wager the majority don't. So they grab their germy mask and put it right back on the next day. Repeat cycle.</p>

        <p>Because, and this is going to be a shocking revelation for you, it is for other people, so your face mask holds all your dumbass personal germs in, if your washing it regularly/not reusing it you won't have any bacterial growths. It's not rocket science, if everyone wears one, everyone keeps their germs from spreading, a toddler could figure it out.</p>

        <p>The more you think about it? If someone wears a mask 8+ hours a day and doesn't wash it, they probably don't wash the rest of their clothes either. Have you tried thinking about it from the point of view of someone who showers daily?</p>

        <p>Anything other than an n95 is ineffective in actually stopping the spread. When the government came out and said "yeah you can use a reusable cloth as a mask" that should have been the first indication that the mask isn't actually that important.</p>

        <p>Patently false? Studies show the most effective mask for ultra fine particles is an n95.</p>

        <p>You're right, I misworded and absolutely should have said less effective, not ineffective. Doesn't change the fact that the best mask to use is an n95, and there are studies showing that the cloth ones are not as effective. If you really wanted people to be safe and wear the masks, then we should give n95 to everyone, but that's not feasible. Instead, maybe we should only have the at risk population mask up.</p>

        <p>If you are not familiar with the concept, most celebrities undergo trauma-based programming from a very young age (especially ones who started out with Disney) in order to be able to mindlessly project and propagate the agenda and symbolism that their handlers want to be implanted into the conscious and subsconscious mind of the populace. </p>
<p>The general consensus is that Kanye appears to be one of the celebs that have been more resistant to the programming and his true self occassionally still shines through, although by now it’s of course distorted, and he is also being constantly discredited by being portrayed as crazy, so he can even straight up say the truth of what he knows and it will be laughed off as crazy talk. There are many other celebrities who „escape” the programming, no shortage of stories of celebrities acting crazy or getting admitted to mental hospitals (where some of the programming happens as well). Look up Project MK Ultra to learn about how they do this.</p>

        <p>Free thinking ≠ bipolar. You are not stupid enough to actually think that so why even say it. </p>
<p>So what if he is bipolar, so what if someone is autistic, so what if someone has ADHD. Does that take away their right to have an opinion. It definitely doesn’t and I’m pretty sure that you also agree with me on this, so this is honestly a waste of time conversation.</p>

        <p>"The Willie Lynch Doctrine instructs slave owners to use public torture and humiliation to create fear in the black man and destroy the male image in the mind of the black woman. Back in the day they used to tie each leg of a black man to a horse, then light him on fire and have the horses pull him apart in front of his woman and all the other african captives. What they do today is shoot Amadu Dialo with 72 bullets, beat the crap out of Rodney King, or have the police cram a plunger up your ass and lock 20 percent of you in jail. But, instead of having all the slaves gather around to witness it, they just broadcast it on TV and get the same result which is the destruction of the Black Male image that all the people witness. These televised images result in the black woman feeling like she can't depend on the black man and it produces "independent women" but independence is not natural in nature."</p>

<p>If you havent read slaveowning instructions written by slaveowners for slaveowners, then you're missing a big part of how our world works today. Because we are still run by slaveowners. Also if you look at conventional animal husbandry practices, they bear resemblance as well.</p>

        <p>I had a profound realization the other day while waiting for the bus. A black woman was patiently waiting in the hot sun with two masks on and a drip of sweat rolling down her forehead. Her eyes had a defeated look, and possibly on her way to go he an essential worker wearing the mask for another 8 hours. </p>
<p>All because some old white guy on tv told her it's common sense to wear two masks.</p>

        <p>Earlier today, I was honestly thinking about this Kanye topic and how relevant it was to the current time. Didn’t realize there were tweets floating about that were already drawing those parallels.</p>

        <p>So, the mask thing hasn't been regulated in regards to the first link, so stating that as a current event is misleading. </p>
<p>If you're around your abuser more often, that's going to lead to an uptick in abuse of course, as far as the second link.</p>
<p>You really are going to try to pin slavery and Corona law together? I get acne bad cause of the mask, but I'm sure as shit going to wear it to work 100% of the time now, as a cook, and Im 100% positive it won't leave a mark like shackles and chains did.</p>

        <p>Slavery isn’t about shackles and chains - that’s the point of what Kanye said. If a society doesn’t have enough people who can think freely, it’s very easy for them to succumb to authoritarianism. And that’s what happened during Covid</p>

        <p>The mandates were to clear up space in hospitals, because they were full. You never had to put on a mask in the first place. Grocers started to go heavy on the delivery shit right away. You couldn't go out to bars and restaurants, damn, sorry you couldn't find a way to socialize any other way.</p>

        <p>Bill Gate's has spent more than $60 billion dollars  to build out the Gate's foundation, a global organization made to prevent and control the spread of infectious disease. Are you such a dipshit that you think none of that money has gone to experts in the field advising him? Or do you honestly think he is randomly spouting off nonsense like you folk?</p>
<p>&rt;Oh, and a guy who contradicts and changes his mind about every other day.</p>
<p>If you mean Dr. Fauci, it is common practice with the scientific field to change your opinion and stance when new information comes to light.</p>
