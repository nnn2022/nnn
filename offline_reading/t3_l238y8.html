    <strong>How some people are not questioning the COVID rules itself?</strong>
    <p><p>I dont care if you believe in this or not, but the rules are such a red flag and people dont really see it(or maybe dont care about it.)</p>
<p>Im not sure how people think they can go to a bar or club and stay there without a mask and be fine even tho there are people all around them WITHOUT A MASKS, and maybe someone who is positive was sitting on the same table as them, but upon leaving they MUST put the mask back even tho they are outside in open space.</p>
<p>But no wait, there a dude who is not wearing a mask, how? Well he is exercising and he dont need to wear mask its safer for you when you run towards your home in a form of exercise but its not safe for you if you are walking home from a pub or some market.</p>
<p>This makes totally no sense to me, not sure if am alone on this one but seems like many people are acually buying the rules and believing in them.</p></p>

        <p>For a community that follows the science - there is no logic or reasoning behind any of it.  </p>
<p>Watching people eat at my local Dunkin Donuts is so funny. Tons of people sitting down with no masks on eating, drinking - But those standing in line all must wear masks. It makes no sense. Wouldn't you expect the Covidians to shout "Stop being selfish! A virus shouldn't have to spread because YOU needed to eat in the store", yet they don't. It's perfectly sound to them.  </p>
<p>In all reality - if a virus so deadly was actually on the loose, none of these people would need to be fined, shut down, scolded online, or yelled at to wear a mask or distance. The fear would be self evidence and natural. But life is entirely normal except for the bizarre restrictions put into place.</p>

        <p>Yep, the logic goes like this. Whatever the government says is good, is good. Whatever the government says is bad, is bad.</p>
<p>The government says eating in Dunkin Donuts without a mask is good, so no issue there.</p>
<p>But the government says standing in Dunkin Donuts without a mask is bad, so you're bad if you do that.</p>
<p>It sounds insane, right? But this is in fact how the majority of people go through life.</p>

<p>Yeah, I agree, that makes no sense. Dr. Fauchi says bars and restaraunts are a great place to catch Covid. Anyone doing that is not listening to the science. They're the reason why we are having 4,000 deaths a day.</p>

        <p>Simple. Because some people really ARE to stupid to think for themselves. Critical thinking skills have been lost in our society. Most people don't read anymore and it's easier to fool an uneducated population.</p>
