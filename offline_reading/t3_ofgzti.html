    <strong>Black-Pilled and Burnt Out</strong>
    <p><p>I am exhausted and I am tired and my hope is running low.  </p>
<p>TLDR: I am black-pilled to all hell and am wondering at what point does it stop being worth it.</p>
<p>I can't even truly say that I am sad, but rather I am walking along the line of apathy - the sheer level of conformity, corruption, ignorance, insincerity is disappointing but also... boring! Humans being assholes in situations you would expect them to be assholes. Much wow. (sarcasm). </p>
<p>Everything has an agenda - movies suck, tv sucks, music sucks, games suck, politics sucks, new books suck. I can't find the things I look for on google and what I do find are usually mid-wit opinion pieces - the quality of data is crap. The food is junk, the quality of so many products is terrible - they break and fall apart and can't withstand the tasks they were made for; everything on our shelves is made in china (which wouldn't be bad if the low prices weren't due to the suffering and exploitation of workers). Most of the "experts" are morons, and the "talented" have no talent. People are hooked on junk food, drugs, sex, and their phones.  </p>
<p>I have TRIED going to church to find better quality people (despite not being strictly Christian myself) and the styles of worship, and the borderline MLM/pyramid schemes, I have come across make me ill. I have a deep respect for theology, history and philosophy and the churches I have found don't even compare.  </p>
<p>Now, I feel the authoritarian guillotine drawing closer to my neck. 18 straight months of this COVID crap. I get that it is important but the madness has outweighed the method. The covid counter-measure has been this bipolar frenzy of policy and mandate. It has been too strong in the areas we needed flexibility, and too limp in the areas we could've used strength. For example, thousands of people have suffered from the lockdowns but urgency to test all viable preventions (such as Ivermectin etc) were totally ignored. Harsh on one end with no logical follow-up. The house is burning down and we didn't even bother to TRY using the neighbors hose until the firefighters show up, so-to-speak.   </p>
<p>I don't want to live under dictators. I don't want to be forced to vax just to go to work (to earn money that barely covers rent and I can't even get close to buying a house, simply because the prices of rent/property are going up). I don't want to eat the bugs and live in a pod. I don't want to be surveilled and tracked everywhere I go. I don't want to start a family because they will be swimming in propaganda (schools, tv shows, peers, etc.) and I worry that bringing them differently will only pass down my own sense of alienation in the world because things seem so unrelatable.  </p>
<p>It's not even that I am coming at this from a depressed mindset. I don't want to "give up" in the woe-is-me sense. Rather, if getting through this life is going to be like trying to sprint through mud, then forget it. This game sucks. It may one day simply be an unplayable game. The controller is faulty and the programmers half-assed. I am 28 now, and have given myself til my 35th birthday. I still have books I want to read and other odds and ends I can and want to experience while I have the window to do so. No need to rush. But I expect that window to close someday. </p>
<p>Part of me wants to add what little I can to pushing this boulder back up the hill. To start bringing the community together or SOMETHING in order to help. I just can't see the end goal clearly enough. I need to know there is a goal and that there are others pushing for it too. </p>
<p>The only shred of hope I have is knowing there are many keen eyes glaring at the oncoming totalitarian machine. Many individuals that are aware and able to see what is happening, and I trust they will be sounding the alarm as the threat looms ever closer. But the resistance does not yet have a strong enough group cohesion and momentum to rival The Cathedral. It is a wire fence against a tsunami, rather than a heavily fortified buttress.   </p>
<p>Pardon the depressive dump, but I really wanted to communicate what I am experiencing. Thanks, if you made it this far. Rest assured, I am currently perfectly fine. Not cause for alarm in regards to self-deletion.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you for a great comment. I do find solace in this community and I am yet to feel threatened or belittled by anyone I have ever come across in here. That said, I don't feel I am enabled or a part of a "group-think" either. It's nice to be around such balanced people such as yourself.   </p>
<p>I hope the size of our strength is bigger than what it appears. Kind of like how authoritarian leftists seem so powerful just because they scream the loudest, but in reverse? I hope there is a huge silent majority that will come together when the time calls for it. Who knows...</p>

        <p>Ha! Here is a dark thought... What if in 100 years the truth does indeed come out. We add our story to the tome of atrocities, and it too never gets read and understand. Quite like how our 20th century history could have easily steered us away from the path we are currently walking. </p>

        <p>Great writing style and I'd say the majority of people here resonate with most of what you've highlighted.  </p>
<p>At this point everything is a watered down vanilla version of its former self.  The entertainment industry is always busy pandering to the latest hysterical social justice flavor of the day , the churches are pure cringe (MLM is a great comparison).</p>
<p>There is seemingly cohesive resistance to covid and people are more than happy to stand in line all day at the slaughterhouses.  </p>
<p>It really is a sad world.  These people have always been sheep and cucks but it's been depressing to walk around for the last 2 years and see them wear their weakness right on their faces.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the compliment on my writing style. It hits home. </p>
<p>It would be nice for people to read what I wrote and find a sense of relief rather than to be weighed down by my worry, or have their own worry entrenched even deeper.  </p>
<p>I am disappointed by the mundane act of evil and tyranny because it is so predictable. I would be truly impressed if the elites used the same power to benefit the populations they wish to rule over. Not to say I want to be ruled over at all. But I would imagine it would be way cooler to be an empowering tyrant. If such a thing could ever be possible. <br>
We have such great technology and knowledge at our disposal and yet we, as a species, seem to be going backwards.   </p>
<p>I mourn for the churches because I think the notion is wonderful. To have a place to congregate and reflect on our values and how we want to traverse the path ahead. The gist of it is amazing, but I don't like how it is currently being used - at least in the churches I have found. The churches trigger the same reflex as the covid propaganda. I don't care if the authority is God or the state - I refuse to follow anything blindly. So the "just let Jesus into your heart and give yourself over to him" translates to me the same as "just trust the science". Either your ethics make sense or they don't. I am not afraid to follow ideals I respect.  </p>
<p>With all that being said, I like your comment. Thanks for the empathy.</p>

        <p>I long for the days eons ago of the country church on Sunday mornings and the picnics on the nice days thereafter.  If you can find a small country church I suggest it.  They still exist, though they are more frequented by the older generations.  It would be nice to repopulate those places with the next generation of families.  I'm not sure how many good preachers exist anymore - I'd almost prefer a church that centered itself more around the weekly gathering of community than it did around the modern day teachings of the Bible.  I think religion has been poisoned with modernity and I'm not sure it can fully recover.</p>
<p>In regards to our leaders - those who want power don't deserve it and those who would make great leaders don't want it.  I'd say Trump was a pretty big exception to that rule.</p>

        <p>I really like your ideas and sentiment about church. I don't know how much our perspectives of Christianity overlap but there appears to be at least some amount, and it's nice. Most of the time I can only speak to devout born-again's, or dogmatic atheists. Neither resonates with me.  </p>
<p>I like your grounded suggestions of a church that focuses on bringing the community together.   </p>
<p>I have been wanting to create my own church because I can't find one that fits me, and I think having some kind of higher narrative is important for humans and societies. I don't care for "saving" people or conversion. I absolutely despise the idea of proselytizing. </p>
<p>I am working on an essay to help flesh out my beliefs and other ideas around theology etc.</p>

        <p>I was raised Catholic and went to catholic school for 12 years, I then spent about 2 years as an atheist before realizing that I was better described as agnostic and then more recently slowly moving into something that I would consider more just spiritual than anything else.  I come to think the flavor of your god is less important than realizing that you aren't it.  </p>
<p>It's clear that a godless society loses its was quickly, and will always gravitate to wanting to trust in a higher being.  Sick as it is that higher being has now become the likes of Gates, pharmaceutical companies and worse of all the government.</p>
<p>I find proselytizing pure cringe - I'm just not cut out for it.  Yet maybe that isn't true because I have no problems proselytizing about the danger of vaccines or government overreach.</p>

        <p>haha perhaps I find christian proselytizing a matter of poor marketing. The "Take Jesus into your heart and he will come to you" and discouraging any attempt to intellectually understand the messages of the Bible, the will of God, or the sociological functioning of Christianity just makes my skin crawl. <br>
Based on an attempt at Petersonian analysis of Christian ideas I have grown to really see the value of Christianity and no matter how much I reassure certain Christians of the value I see in the belief it is simply not blind enough for them or "faith" as they call it. As I say, I don't care if it is God or the state. I will never follow anyone blindly. I only put genuine faith in those I trust AFTER I have vetted them. I think blind faith of any kind leads to problems.   </p>
<p>Whereas I would hope that proselytizing against vaccines or the Government would be based on a logical and linear path of explanation, rather than just emotional assertions.   </p>
<p>I am always open to having my mind changed as long as the other person can make a better argument than I can AND it fits with my guiding philosophies. <br>
I would be "Christian" with or without God or Jesus' approval because when I act in alignment with Christian ethics I feel better and things go better.</p>

        <p>I’ve always had a deeper respect for Buddhism because they <em>don’t</em> proselytize and they just work on themselves and controlling what they can. Buddhist temples in Asia were the absolute most peaceful places I’ve ever been, just a weird sort of calm. I was wanting to go on one of those things where you can stay with them for a month but now we can’t go anywhere. Being raised in church though and gay, it’s really not for me, too much focus on what other people are doing. Too condescending to other cultures and people of the world, though some Christians are great, can’t generalize everyone</p>

        <p>Good post my friend, and relatable. Speaking as a Christian most of my church family are all believers in the narrative, shutting up church and getting injected/joining this clinical trial. I am ashamed of the church on the whole in the UK. However there are a few of us who can see what is really going on.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for my hope in Christ - firstly that He paid my debt on the cross, that one day He will judge and deal with all evil forever, and that He will make the heavens and the earth new one day, then I would not be here; further, I would also not have the strength to face what is coming for those of us not getting injected.</p>

        <p>As I said, I am not quite christian - I am totally down for the ideas and values, but have my own approach to making sense of it. With that said, I share and appreciate your sentiment. I am mildly impressed by the diversity of N3. I have seen men and women of all ages, beliefs, and levels of conspiracy. Your expression of your faith made me think of that, is all.   </p>
<p>This whole experience has certainly motivated me to dig deeper into my ideas of philosophy and religion. I think it points to something when the mainstream so readily attacks the Judeo-Christian foundations of western culture. Literal God or not... there must be something in there that they don't like. If it means we all convert back to a kind of "cultural Christianity" to at least revive and replace some of the missing societal structures in order to fend off catastrophe, count me in wholly. From kind open-minded atheists to devoted believers. As long as we are pushing for the same thing, I am in.  </p>
<p>I hope your faith serves you well.</p>

        <p>Here's a thought: When Islam looks at the West and sees "The Great Satan", are they really far off?</p>
<p>We have girls dressed in skulls, makeup like death, gyrating half naked singing about how they are going to kill their friend that owes them money - and depict themselves in videos drinking their blood or bathing in it.</p>
<p>We have a Pastor of a Christian church, who pimped his oldest daughter out to the music industry, who gyrates half naked to pop music, whilst still wearing a Cross around her neck - then he pimps out his younger daughter as she gets to age of maturity.</p>
<p>We have another lady, who is a daughter herself of a Pastor, who said "I couldn't make it as a Christian singer, so I sold my soul to the devil" and now makes videos with Illuminati imagery, posing herself as a grand Queen, and speaks of eating hearts and cannibalism..</p>
<p>Everywhere you look in our culture, from music to movies, we see death, skulls and occultic practices, murder and hedonism up front and center.</p>
<p>We are not God's nation.</p>

        <p>I am feeling this too but with the added thought of maybe we should just let the sheep be slaughtered. Their idiocy is great and their numbers large, in order for some sort of return to normalcy, maybe several need to go.</p>
<p>I don't like thinking this, because that means many of my friends and family, the father of my children included, would go. But how else can we bring sanity back if they refuse to wake? I don't know what to do either but I refuse giving up. I'm stuck in a holding pattern and just waiting. I believe in God, so I trust that he will guide us through this mess. Its the waiting that gets me antsy.</p>

        <p>I am sorry to hear that the issue is as close as your immediate family. It really is tough figuring out where to draw the lines and from whom you should detach.  </p>
<p>My thinking is that most people genuinely want good things to happen. I was still pro-government, pro-vaccine, pro-lockdown in the very very beginning. I shunned those people breaking curfews and lockdowns. I still think it is important for us all to do our bit to weather tragedies. If this were a war or genuine overt threat, I might still be quite rigid. But the pandemic has been treated like a joke by all authorities. So, that undermined my value of us all working together. My point being, some people haven't snapped out of it yet. They still think we are all in this together... and they aren't wrong... if the global threat was actually justified.<br>
I want us to beat the "covid" thing and get on with our lives, but not at the cost of a Brave New World. And THAT is what the normies can't see. The patterns of authority don't trigger any Huxlian or Orwellian associations, likely because they have never read those books or don't take those ideas seriously.</p>
<p>The ones I worry about are those that may on some level think "I am no Gestapo, but I now see why Stalin needed them. Some people just don't do as they are told" (I have seen lines of thought like this).  </p>
<p>Thank God you are aware of things though. I will be keeping you, and others like us, in mind as we move through this thing.</p>

<p>That is truly terrifying to read, that there are people making excuses for needing Gestapo type action. Those are the lost ones that I do not mind losing to injection side effects.</p>
<p>I am aware but my family is toast. Both sets of parents/in laws have taken pfzier or moderna. Only my brothers have abstained, I think all of my inlaws have taken it. I've switched from dreading this winter to trying to make the most of the time I have with those who have taken these injections..... in case summer is all the time I have left with them.</p>
<p>I know I will do what is necessary to keep my kids safe, so I pray I can hold on.</p>

        <p>I don't know if this provides any hope. But people can pass at any  time for any reason, regardless of covid or the vax. We get criticized by Pro-vaxxers for the risk we supposedly bring upon ourselves, and we must be careful not to mirror them in regards to the vax. </p>
<p>Forgive them for they know not what they do. Or as Alan Watts says "Give them a blessing for they know not what they do".<br>
Any one of us could have fallen on any side of this issue. Who knows what glitch in our software that lead us to doubt authority. </p>
<p>Everyone is scared and exhausted and just trying to do the best they can with the information they have. May I encourage you not to view the vax as a death sentence?  It absolutely has its issues, I will never deny that. But the vax is only one part of the bigger problem. Just because some family chose to get it doesn't mean they are doomed. As I said, people go at any time for any reason, so maybe them getting the vax has incentivized you to be more attentive to your relationships. Regardless of how long they live, I hope you can have a good relationship with everyone in your life.</p>

        <p>That is what I am trying to do, maybe I didn't articulate my meaning as I intended.</p>
<p>While I will still hold that worry in the back of my mind, for the here and now, I have chosen to be present with my friends and family around me. I don't want them to suffer, but they have made their decision and thankfully so far none are trying to force their decision on me.</p>
<p>You are right to say that they may not be doomed. That is what I hope to be true. In my husband's case, I have moved past the trying to convince him of his decision. He took it, so now we will deal with the consequences, whatever they may be. He said he did it for me so that I won't be ill since I am still recovering from long term genetic liver damage that I had no idea I was suffering.</p>
<p>Life is bittersweet. It is not meant to be good all the time, unfortunately.</p>

<p>I used to wonder how historical figures would fight in battles, sometimes knowing it to be a lost cause but still going unafraid to their deaths.</p>
<p>I recently had a near death experience with a tragic loss. I met God and finally understood the reason why for what I endured. It was totally humbling and filled me with that knowledge I needed to be able to say unquestionably that I am not afraid.</p>

        <p>Some days are better than others.  I recently moved out of a city to a rural area and things are pretty normal.  I don’t really have expensive tastes so I save a lot of money. I’m looking for a job but I may just do odd jobs and handyman work I’m pretty good at home repair and painting the type of work I used to do was in the medical field and I assume they would require the vax and I ain’t doing it.  You are a good writer btw not sure what field you are in.  I’m kinda waiting to see what happens this autumn and winter I have a gut feeling things may be bad so hang in there</p>

        <p>I admire your handyman skills. That is brilliant. I wish I could  do things like that - I am starting to try! One of the gifts from the past year and a bit was a renewed appreciation for a simpler, more modest kind of life. Cities seem like death-traps should any issue arise. I want to be somewhere small and quiet; out of view from the state and the mob. </p>

        <p>Although you may be feeling depressed right now, it is a natural reaction to dealing with REALITY - but it will pass.</p>
<p>Your thoughts and observations mirror my own.</p>
<p>Welcome to the ones who live in the world, but are not OF the world.</p>
<p>Churches are divided and are full of hypocrites unfortunately, but the tenets and base are good to live by. Research the Cardinal Virtues and develop them, and seek them in others, and observe where those virtues are not present in others - it will explain a lot.</p>
<p>I have no answer or solution for you, because this is the way of the world now. </p>
<p>Work through the anger, the grief and depression, as it is part of "acceptance", and believe me - dealing with REALITY (guided by self-assessment) gives you a lot of power - as you can make appropriate and informed decisions.</p>

        <p>Roger that. I have been thinking to try harder to disconnect. My town is lucky in that it looks pretty normal, minus a handful of masked people. Staring at the problem isn't going to make it go away. So, spending more time outside and away from things is a good idea.</p>

        <p>The only real white pill in the world is Jesus. Jesus reigns in heaven right now and he is coming back. </p>
<p>You currently see the game being played but you don’t see all the players. The main player, God most High, is still in the game. All of us who ally with God have already won. So what can they do to us? Inject us? Imprison us? Kill us? </p>
<p>Jesus says: “Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭10:28-31‬ ‭NIV‬‬</p>
<p>He also says: “So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭10:26-27‬ ‭NIV‬‬ </p>
<p>It’s our job to speak about Christ until he comes. And when it’s our time to die, we go to be united with him forever. </p>
<p>Life is a gift from God, an opportunity to know and love him. Don’t squander it with apathy. You have a mission, go do it.</p>

A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world. So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.”

        <p>I am genuinely curious how your Christian faith, such as it is, connects with the values of No New Normal? <br>
It seems the general crowd of N3 are atheist or agnostic/spiritual and a handful are genuine Christian etc. Since you lead with Jesus as the solution to my post, it would seem your faith is important to you and is your lens through which you see the world and the dilemmas we face in the world. So, how did you get to No New Normal and what do you think kept you from joining the normies? Did your faith play a role in that, and if so, how?  </p>
<p>I want to know what you see and how the current situation of things makes sense to you.    </p>
<p>I hope this doesn't sound like a debate or anything like that. :) I really do want to know. I am not quite in-sync with the whole "let Jesus guide me" thing. I understand the value of the idea but I am too rebellious for my own good. But I deeply respect Christian ethics and respect how you choose to form your relationship to them.</p>

        <p>Have you ever heard of Mark Passio or Whatonearthishappening.com?</p>
<p>A lot of what we hear are distractions.  A very long and wacky game is being played with our minds and those we play against are very good at what they do.</p>
<p>The podcast mentioned above has helped me gain some insight as well as leading me to a lot of other information.  Going to church isn't the same as studying yourself deeply.  Church should be a group of people that work on themselves and help eachother in that work.</p>
<p>I love you.  Life plays on a rhythym with ups and downs.  I will pray for you to feel that up soon.</p>

        <p>Hey, thank you for writing this. I feel the exact same way. Thank you for putting it into words.  I have also been struggling a lot with these same feelings and ideas.  I feel upset because most of my family and friends have taken the shot despite my warnings.  It makes me feel paranoid that everyone will become ill.  The economic destruction of the lockdowns and inability to travel have really destroyed me.
For me the white pill is the hope that I can watch all these things burn.  I want the institutions that failed me to fail.  Even prior to covid I knew that things couldn’t continue down this same path.  I feel like a lot of things will come to a head soon.  Maybe the best thing that can happen is that this whole blister will burst and we can start healing.</p>

        <p>This. </p>
<p>For the longest time, I felt like I was watching the world happen. I could see all the governments/economies/policies go for things against reality, against the natural order of life and wonder why no one tried to fix it. At the same time I realized that the problems were so ingrained and so large that only God himself could reverse the trend.</p>
<p>Churches have been twisted to a shadow of what they should have been. I was raised Catholic but have since fallen away from the hierarchical structure and just read my Bible at home. They lied when they said the Sacraments were important but shut their doors and denied them to us. Correct me if I'm wrong, but not even during the Black Death did the Church shut down, so why for this puny annoying man made virus? Because the Church leaders have been usurped by evil creatures, it is the only answer that fits.</p>

        <p>One fact I've been taking comfort in is that all the great writers and philosophers of the past dealt with people who were afraid and willing to sleep for promised safeties and hope they're not the one on the outside of the herd who gets picked off by wolves. So that means the great thinkers who learn to change history (inventors, mathematicians, artists, etc.) also all fought against the resistance and mindless opposition of the masses. From Socrates, to Christ, to Galileo, each brings forth the truth he has identified in his observations and evaluations to be judged by the world. </p>
<p>Some were condemned in their time and praised now, some learned to only share their knowledge with select people, some are vilified now for having told the truth or continuing to tell the truth. While there is great potential for destruction, it's true that there is nothing new under the sun. Principled men and women of all past generations faced the same challenges of mind, heart, body, and soul that are part of being a manifested form in a physical universe. Every human struggles with identity and purpose in their own way. </p>
<p>So the challenge need not ever be to convince someone of one's own rightness (as there are measures beyond an individual's current knowledge that may eventually prove them wrong), but to share a truth from a new perspective. This is a long-hidden mystery of humanity: that we can hold opposing perspectives--or conflicting truths--within ourselves and understand and judge the reality of both. So our first concern is loyalty to the principles we have identified as true in our own hearts. </p>
<p>If you're already talking about not wanting to live like this, what do you have to lose from fighting back? Your life? You've already said you're willing to give that up. So what is it you ARE willing to live for? Start fighting for those things by living by the principles you identify as true. What are we so afraid of losing? That's what I'm fighting for.</p>

        <p>I feel you. I expressed something similar yesterday. I have nothing for you but my commiseration. I guess "this too shall pass" or something cliche like that. You are the age of my oldest son, and I really feel for your generation. You guys are getting screwed out of so much. At least I had the opportunity to buy a house when buying a house was feasible, and we had a lot of hope for our children's future. I don't think I'll get to be a grandmother because my son feels the same as you. No way he wants to raise a family in this dystopia. It does feel so hopeless lately. 
Everything has its season, though. We shall see this thing through to the end. Hang in there.</p>

        <p>I really relate to what you said about church - I go sometimes and enjoy it but I can’t quite convince myself to believe all of it. I’m a spiritual person and believe in a higher power but I’ve always had a hard time going all in with the dogma aspect of religion (I tried Buddhism in the past too and although it was a wonderful community, I just couldn’t get all the way there.)</p>
