    <strong>Are quarantines for travelers actually enforced?</strong>
    <p><p>This has been something that I've been wondering for a year. I see places like Canada, the UK, and several states here in the U.S. that had "mandatory quarantines" for people traveling to those places. What do these places do, if anything, to enforce said quarantine? Are you put under lock and key by armed guards? Is it an honor system? Do police stop and check you if you are out and about to see if you abided by the quarantine? I'd like to hear from someone who has experienced this. I haven't traveled anywhere that required a quarantine in the last year.</p></p>

        <p>In the UK it depends. For the majority of returns you can quarantine in your own place. For example when I returned here in January, I never even had anyone call me and only got a text that I need to quarantine. Apparently now people are called daily, but I've not heard about anyone being actually visited and a lot of my friends have travelled since quarantining was imposed. Situation is different when you return from red list countries, as you are put in hotel quarantine, and yes, it is enforced.</p>

        <p>They’re enforced here in Canada. 
Quarantine at an approved hotel or pay something like a $3000 fine (that you could probably take to court anyway). They have you prove your hotel reservation using the ArriveCAN app.</p>

        <p>So can you check into the hotel and then leave? Is there someone preventing you from leaving your hotel room?</p>

        <p>You aren’t allowed to leave your hotel room until you have a negative covid test lol you have to book for three nights and it could turn into two weeks. They bring you food, there’s security. It’s a prison.</p>

        <p>There was one in my state for any out of state travel, but it finally got dropped a few months ago. I was gonna just not tell my work I was going anywhere and ignore it if they didn’t get rid of it tbh lol</p>
<p>Edit: I’ll add that it was only loosely enforced. If you didn’t openly say you’re traveling, nobody could ask you or force you to do anything. There was nobody at the airports checking or anything. Just some voluntary form online to take. I know tons of people probably ignored it</p>
