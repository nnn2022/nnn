    <strong>Why should we care</strong>
    <p><p>I believe covid is real, I believe the numbers are grossly exaggerated. I believe that it really does kill old and obese people as easily as the media says. I believe the media grossly exaggerates how bad the disease is for clicks and to control people. I also believe we shouldn’t give a shit. Everyone dies someday, we can only control nature so much.</p>
<p>The world is extremely overpopulated as it is and that lowers the amount of time that humans as a species can live on Earth. Am i saying we should just let people die and go on with our lives? Yes.</p>
<p>Tons of old and obese people have died from the flu every year for a long long time. We don’t shut the world down every winter, do we? </p>
<p>I feel like everyone (including on this sub) argues about the facts of the disease when we should be talking about why were trying to stop a pandemic in the first place. If the lockdowns were really 2 weeks it would have made some sense, but this shit is completely pointless.</p></p>

<p>This is the biggest lie that people on this sub continue to believe. What evidence do you have that the earth is overpopulated? What is your definition of 'overpopulation?'</p>

        <p>The way we live right now and use fossil fuels cant sustain this many people doing it. Burning fossil fuels releases CO2 -&rt; global warming -&rt; thermohaline circulation in the ocean gets disrupted from higher ocean temperatures-&rt; more hurricanes and natural distasters -&rt; more species go extinct eventually to the point that it kills them all but us. If you don’t believe climate change you really are a conspiracy theorist. What makes more sense? Billionaire oil moguls spreading lies, or people who think we should have less people on earth (there is no money in that)?</p>

        <p>Are you aware that the ExPeRtZ have been bloviating about apocalyptic climate change since the 1930s? They have been wrong 100% of the time. Do you want me to show you the evidence - because you have clearly never spent an iota of your time independently investigating the issue - or will you continue to call me a CoNsPiRaCy ThEoRiSt? Repeating MSM talking points doesn't constitute research, BTW. I really thought that the current C19 debacle would make everyone question SETTLED SCIENCE^(TM) especially now that we see that the C19 lockdowns are slowly being transformed into climate change lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Yea but im not one of those people that says the coasts are gonna be underwater in next year. And im also not one of those people saying that going vegan will save the world. Im saying humans have been around for 100000 years and we have maybe a good couple thousand left. I went to school for the stuff, and theres no money motivating me to bitch about this.</p>

        <p>That's great and proves that you're not an ecofascist veggie-Nazi. What I am asking you to do is to QUESTION the things that you learned in school and have been deemed SETTLED SCIENCE^(TM). I never questioned your ethics, I just asked you to be objective and look at the possibility that you may have been deceived by the same people who want to transform C19 lockdowns into climate change lockdowns.</p>

        <p>CO2 is plant food. The higher it gets, the better they do and the less water they need. We're at ~400ppm average outside. Current plants want ~1500ppm for ideal growth. Conversely, the lower it gets the worse they do. Below 150ppm plants starve and die.</p>
<p>Do you know the earth has been greening the last few decades from all this "excess" CO2? It's all fear porn. The only thing that can cause less green these days is us actively trying to kill it.</p>

        <p>Dude there is LITERALLY propganda being spread by fossil fuel companies that takes that fact and twists it to make it seem okay that we’re fuckin trashing the earth. There was some website like CO2isfertilizer.com or something like that and it was proved that it was completely funded by some oil company CEO. CO2 is a fertilizer but the rates we are releasing it are doing more harm than good, and the fertilizer effect is diminishing over time.</p>

        <p>The Death rate in the UK over the last year is no worse then it was in 2005 and any time before that... </p>
<p>So there is absolutely no need for such draconian measures... 
I agree with the main point you said... we should carry on as normal... people die everyday, that is a natural part of life... everyone dies.</p>
<p>So why not enjoy the time we have rather than trying to squeeze out an extra year or two for the extremely vulnerable? 
The freedoms of the young and future generations are far more important than a couple of extra years.</p>

        <p>I'm at the point now where I want to scream when I hear people talking about it. I just don't give a shit anymore. I agree with you, I know it's real I've known people who have died from it over the past year but every single one of them had some pretty serious health problems before they got it. I'm just tired of it, it's about more than a virus and many people have been successfully programmed to accept all of this crap.</p>
