    <strong>Crucial Arguments that few mention - I want to hear your thoughts</strong>
    <p><p>Hello Everyone. </p>
<p>I am fairly active on this subreddit and others similar to this, and I also watch a lot of radio shows from a variety of sources, etc. </p>
<p>I want to bring up some talking points/thoughts that I haven't heard anyone mention often or at all. I would appreciate if you could read them and share your thoughts. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>1. Wearing a simple cloth mask/medical mask to stop the spread of a virus is an extremely new theory that was never proven before.</strong> </p>
<p>When the pandemic started a year ago, I did a good amount of research as to the effectiveness of mask wearing to stop a virus. I used multiple browsers and websites to find different studies including regular Google, DuckDuckGo on Tor, etc to reach as much information as I could. What I found was extremely interesting. </p>
<p>Before 2020 (pre-Covid), I could not find a single study or source that stated that surgical masks work to prevent any sort of virus transmission. Out of the many that I could find, whether it be testing air through a cloth mask or study groups of patients who had a virus, etc, most studies stated that there was further research needed to make a conclusion. Some studies said that the results concluded that mask wearing does nothing, <em>but there were none that I could find that stated that mask wearing had a  negative/positive effect on a virus spreading within a population.</em> </p>
<p>It is also important to note that there are no large-scale studies on the effects of virus spread on a population with mask wearing.</p>
<p>Mind you, I read studies before 2020, when funding these tests was not yet politicized.</p>
<p>It is almost like some people think that the opposite is true, that <em>not</em> wearing a mask to stop a virus is some sort of new science. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>2. There are no rules/regulations for a proper facemask</strong> </p>
<p>If the mainstream media is true and mask wearing is extremely important to slow the spread of the virus, then what are the requirements for a proper mask? <strong>CDC official answer: Double Cloth (two layers) .</strong>  I'm not joking. They do not specify what type of cloth, strength, size, etc. If there are two layers, then it follows CDC guidelines. </p>
<p>How the F*$&amp; are masks so important to save lives yet there are no rules on which ones are the proper ones to wear? Just that I need to <em>wear one.</em> </p>
<p>Lots of people bring up the <em>seatbelt argument</em>, how wearing a mask in public is like wearing a seatbelt on the road, but they fail to mention that car manufacturers have actual proper rules/testing on which seatbelts are safer, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/tp-209-08_tag.pdf">you can read about that here</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>3. SINGLE USE Surgery mask/bacteria</strong> </p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to mention that the wearing of surgical masks in professional fields of work such as medicine, science etc, never was for the purpose of stopping a virus. Surgeons wear them for the same reason that dentists wear them for the same reason that <a href="https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-watch-the-UAEs-first-deep-space-probe-reach-750x375.jpg">space probe engineers wear them</a>, it is to stop the spread of bacteria/saliva or aerosols, not to stop the spread of a virus, which I will explain soon.</p>
<p>The same surgical masks that people use in public are the same ones that medical professionals wear, except the only difference is <em>they actually treat them how they're designed, for single usage.</em> </p>
<p>If a surgeon touches their mask with their hands, the mask is considered useless and they must throw it out. They also have a time limit of about a few hours as well. </p>
<p>So if the mainstream theory that a facemask catches all of my infected bacteria is true, <strong>why don't we treat it as hazardous waste?!</strong> </p>
<p>Apparently as long as I am wearing my single-use facemask I can touch it all I want, touch my face and other surfaces, heck, <em>even reuse it!</em> And nobody gives a shit. Why aren't there as much advertisement to wear a mask as there should be to wear it and <em>dispose of it</em> properly.</p>
<p>I've seen a little bit about washing your reusable facemask, but nothing about touching your face/mask or replacing them.  </p>
<p>I don't know a single person who hasn't thrown out their single-use surgical mask after 1 use. Everyone I know reuses them hundreds of times before they end up on the ground somewhere. </p>
<p>Can you imagine if you could use a needle multiple times? People would be absolutely disgusted. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;There is one last thing that I want to mention that is extremely important, <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>"Science" is not what hypothesis is the most true/accurate, but which is the most widely accepted.  This validation can be obtained through whatever means necessary, often corruption and politics.</strong> <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>And if you think that scientists generally agree on things, you need a long history lesson!</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Stay safe, everyone. And please discuss in the comments.</p></p>

        <p>lots of good points. the only time i throw away a mask after 1 use is the one i‚Äôm required to use in place of my own cloth one that my university gives me for labs, and afterwards it grosses me out cause i feel like i got ‚Äúdissection juice‚Äù all over it. but yeah, i have similar studies i‚Äôve saved pre-2020 that always seemed to conclude ‚Äúour findings did not suggest that masks reduced virus transmission‚Äù, etc. etc.</p>

        <p>The Swedes seem to be on point with this. They have officially stated that masks are not effective at preventing viral transmission, and have even banned them in some regions. </p>
<p>Whatever happened to the virus being able to survive on surfaces for days, even weeks? Whatever happened to airborne transmission?</p>
<p>I actually wonder if a major motivation for enforcing mask mandates is psychological, in that it gets people to be aware of the virus and causes them to take it seriously. Although, this is not ethical, as it deludes people into thinking that a mask will protect them and others, when it won't. Not to mention it's dishonest.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure I've heard some Canadian health officials, although I forget exactly who, admit that this (psychological thing) is one of the reasons masks were mandated/encouraged.</p>
