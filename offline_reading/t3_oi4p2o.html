    <strong>Shedding? Women please respond to help me understand</strong>
    <p><p>I have been searching for this. A place to get real info; somewhere I can hope to put this all together- I may or may not get censored as I typically do but here it goes..</p>
<p>I hope folks will finally listen to me. I‚Äôm 31F. For my whole life I‚Äôve had regular period that came every 28 days on time lasting 4-5 days max.</p>
<p>After staying with my bf parents post their vaccine I had 3 periods in 2 months (this was after their first shot)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After spending more time with them (2days) I developed an ovarian cyst that ruptured for the first time in my life (1.5 months after their second shot)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It happened a second time a month later while I was staying at their house (3days) (less than a week after his sisters second shot)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It happened a third time after staying with my dad (2days) post his vaccine, spent a 2 hour car ride with him to a hiking spot- half way up the mountain it ruptured (a little under 2 months from his final shot)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe this is all coincidence .. I have not gotten the vaccine.. But this has been the weirdest 6 months of my life and maybe coincidence it lined up with me spending time around vaccinated folks idk
I often live by once is a coincidence, maybe even twice- but three is a pattern</p>
<p>I want to gather data to see if this is lining up for anyone else/similar effects?</p>
<p>Wondering about amount of time spent with vaccinated folks and how long/quickly you developed off menstrual/reproductive symptoms</p></p>

        <p>Try hit up shedding or vaccine shed in search tab on this sub. There's every once in awhile anecdotal story and others in comments to affirm their own experiences... There's also study being conducted <a href="https://www.vaccineshed.com/">online</a>. Even some women came out and said that <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/60c753ec4c89190f3bad43ca">NAC</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/o3306r/ivermectin_prevents_the_spike_protein_from/">ivermectin</a> seem to help (supposedly against spike proteins binding which seems to be the culprit.)</p>

        <p>You confused me at first when you said you had ‚Äúregular 28 day periods‚Äù-  but the other info in your posts makes it look like that was a typo.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt have any data for you- but I will say that I got hugged by a vaccinated person and the next morning my period came in STRONG- and early for that time of the month. It was really heavy but lasted the normal amount of days I have it. I‚Äôve been having lots more cramps (I never get cramps) a couple weeks after getting my monthly. So far- nothing else out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Has your diet and exercise changed lately? Sometimes stress has something to do with it. What‚Äôs your birth control routine?</p>

        <p>I agree. I‚Äôm open to it being coincidence I am hopeful that it is.</p>
<p>However, I practice as a therapist and have often found that once or even twice could be coincidence but upon the third time it is reasonable to start considering a pattern (usually of behavior lol but still, I initially focused on research)</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm coming up to a very unavoidable 4 days :(</p>
<p>My bf sister is coming to stay with us for 4 days; in 1.5 weeks- we have a one bedroom open concept living room dining area apartment with the bedroom down the hall. She will be sleeping in the living room truly not much I can do- family dynamics dictate many sacrifices </p>
<p>I‚Äôll be keeping all windows open
Sheets on couch although she‚Äôs bringing a blow up bed
No shared cutlery or drinks
Spraying down the bathroom after her
She‚Äôs bringing her own pillow and blankets
We‚Äôre planning full days outside and going out to eat</p>
<p>Any other suggestions I‚Äôm very open
I may be pulling up coincidences, I admit that, I‚Äôm trying to prove myself wrong or possibly right.
But, 3 ovarian cysts with massive ruptures all of a sudden at age 31??
It feels like a pattern but I guess I‚Äôll find out</p>

        <p>I have had no menstrual issues whatsoever. I don't live with anyone. I work with some vaccinated people (in a large building, we're not physically close for very long) and one person in my family got it, and I've been in the same room as him for hours several times. Either that's not enough to trigger a reaction or I'm somehow resistant to the effect. Or maybe he got saline, he didn't have any side effects either.</p>

It‚Äôs just odd that in 31 years of life it‚Äôs all of a sudden happening now and the timing of it all- but it could be coincidence</p>

        <p>Have you looked into germ theory vs terrain theory? The more I look into germ theory, the more I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs bullshit. </p>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think shedding is real -but if germ theory is flawed -then as long as your body is strong and healthy, those spike proteins you encounter via shedding (in a minuscule amount compared to what‚Äôs circulating inside a vaccinated person) should be taken care of very quickly. </p>
<p>My fianc√©‚Äôs whole side of the family is vaccinated, and  we are very close. I‚Äôm not menstruating, but I am currently going through a high risk pregnancy (sounds bad, but unrelated. I already had a history of high risk pregnancy in 2018. Also during this pregnancy I‚Äôm doing much better than in 2018.) I try to stay away from them for about 2 weeks after each of their shots, but other than that we get on with our life. We hug, prepare dinner together, and see each other multiple times a week for hours at a time. The only ill effects I‚Äôve ever had was the day after one of them got vaccinated and didn‚Äôt tell me -I had a mild headache that went away an hour or so after I left. </p>
<p>To be getting adverse effects after they got the shot 1.5/2 months ago is really wild to me. I don‚Äôt think it would be a bad thing to go to the doctor and get checked out. </p>
<p>Other than that, remember that the mind is incredibly powerful. Sometimes a sugar pill is just as effective, if not more so than the medicine they‚Äôre trialing it against. If you are expecting to experience side effects after being around them, and are stressed and fearful about it, then you‚Äôve just negatively placebo‚Äôd yourself friend.</p>

        <p>Really good points.
I only developed this theory two days ago when I started writing down the dates for my OBGYN</p>
<p>Looks like I‚Äôve just a a bout of shit luck then
I definitely kept in mind it was coincidence and it would be actually both relieving (because I love seeing my family) and maybe the very very slightest of slightest bummers only because then I‚Äôd have an answer</p>

        <p>I'm not vaccinated but most people around me are. I haven't felt any issues at all, except for maybe some very intense cramps 10 days before my period 1 month ago. But I'm sure that's unrelated because by then I had spent a lot of time with vaccinated for months.
Also sorry this happens for you. Stay safe. If this shedding thing is real, maybe not everyone is affected or they react different to it.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned it really could be coincidence (and likely is) and I‚Äôve just had a round of shite luck this past 5 months.

        <p>Yeah it's hard to know because of the uncertainty around the vaccines and the stories we read. Just pay attention to it and make a timeline and see how your body reacts. If you think it gets worse, probably speak to a doctor.
Yeah the best news would be that it's just bad luck and odd timing</p>

        <p>No problem and 100% agree with you about this sub. Even if the people don't agree, nobody gets banned or kicked off just for asking sincere questioning or doubting what's going on. I think it's important for us to have an open mind and listen to others experiences. I also have a personal reason for not getting vaccinated because 2 years ago I got my hepatitis nr 2 shot and around 1 week later my chronic pain started. I haven't wanted to post it on other subs (even before 2020) of the fear of being shut down. I really hope your situation will improve</p>

Interestingly enough when I got the H1N1 vaccine, 3 days later I was the sickest I‚Äôve ever been in my life for like 6 days (well I‚Äôve been sicker but not with a flu)</p>
<p>Thanks for chatting. I always feel better talking things through- even if I‚Äôm wrong. What freaks me out about this covid and vaccine stuff is that no one can talk about it negatively or question it which is horrible!</p>

        <p>Last weekend my BFF got her first dose (Pfizer, I think).  She told my she had gotten it on Thursday, and was asking for me to visit on Saturday night.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt want to because I‚Äôm aware of shedding and she had just had it so recently.  But 75% of my coworkers have had it and it‚Äôs never sees to make any difference. Although I have heard that it only happens in very close proximity (riding in a car, sitting closely next to them).   And I knew we were going to be hanging out watching Netflix in her bedroom. </p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to go because I felt guilty about blowing her off last week.</p>
<p>Wrong choice.</p>
<p>Literally the next morning I woke up and from 9am to 11am I had bad cramps (period not due for over a week).  We had been together about 3-4 hours. </p>
<p>I NEVER get cramps.  I‚Äôm blessed with light and pain-free periods.  I am the same age and I haven‚Äôt experienced period cramps since high school.  </p>
<p>So that was <em>highly</em> unusual.  I‚Äôm due for mine early next week, I hope everything turns out okay.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the OBGYN said she has no idea why this would be happening now and heavily focused on that it is not life/reproductive threatening and discussed pain management should another occur next month. My fingers are crossed it does not happen because when it ruptures it is extraordinarily painful</p>
