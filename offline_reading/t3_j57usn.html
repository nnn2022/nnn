    <strong>The Czech Republic "beat" covid by wearing masks (article from July 14). In the last week, it ranked 6th in the world in cases per million</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/07/14/how-czech-republic-beat-covid-require-everyone-wear-face-masks-column/5426602002/">This USA Today article</a> from July 14th proclaims how well the Czech Republic fared with covid, explaining the use of masks as the obvious reason why.</p>
<p>In the last week, the Czech Republic reported the 6th most cases per million in the world.</p>
<p>The larger pattern I see, is that other nearby eastern european countries such as Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria all have very similar distributions of cases from March through today. They never had significant first waves and are only now seeing a first surge.</p>
<p>I'd speculate that masks had little to do with the initial success, since all these other countries showed similar patterns. The countries all are less "connected" to the world as western Europe, hence the slower spread until now.</p>
<p>I'm not against masks or lockdowns, in general. It's possible that lockdowns can be used as a precautionary measure to help us understand the lethality of a novel virus.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/264466031/mask-usage-flattened-growth-of-covid-19-cases-in-czech-republic">Here is another article from March 29</a> where a data scientist attempts to assign causality of the low case rates directly to masks. This is basic cherry picking data 101 to fit a narrative.</p>
<p>I personally wear a mask when inside (basically just supermarkets) and semi-crowded outdoor areas (like schools) and see them as a minor inconvenience and a decent precautionary measure.</p></p>

        <p>Heh, I wasn't expecting this bit of the discussion to get a response. I put it in there to provide a better understanding of my position. I think mask wearing is important as a precautionary measure (this doesn't mean I am sure it has a positive effect), though distancing seems to be a better way to prevent transmission.</p>
<p>It's possible we are nearing the end of covid as the countries that are experiencing second waves have extremely few deaths compared to the first. If these countries can pull out of this second wave in the next 6 weeks, I'll be more at ease about mask wearing.</p>

        <p>from what you write you have really boughten in to the whole scandemic 'narrative'</p>
<p>what does it matter what other countries do? what does that have to do with your plight in the CR?</p>
<p>the mainland u.s.a claims millions of 'cases' and 200k are claimed to have died with not from the covid. therefore hawaii, where i live must be shut down since march even though a mere 150 elderly sick have died with the covid?</p>
<p>just today, the state reports a total of 70 new 'cases' with none requiring hospitals out of 1.4 million people. yet still locked down</p>
<p>&rt; I'll be more at ease about mask wearing</p>
<p>i am further saddened to read this.</p>

        <p>I mean, you do you re: masks in terms of personal use. </p>
<p>As long as you do advocate masks as soon as you leave the house or advocate masks for long term use (like to a vaccine), we can have very reasonable discussions.</p>

        <p>The best way to use masks is to wear one when you feel sick or feel like you might be getting sick (presymptomatic) like waking up extra groggy or a headache that doesn't normally happen. This is how China and all the other Asians counties use masks. They never mandate healthy people be forced to wear them.</p>

        <p>Your analysis is on the right track but you need to incorporate the real world population using the masks incorrectly which is the dominant mode of usage. That alone is making the masks either nearly useless or with negative utility by increasing the spread.</p>

        <p>Yes, it would be nice to have a study about this. Would be extremely difficult to pull off. You'd have to stop people at random in public, assess their mask usage, swab the mask, etc... You'd then have to watch this person in a natural setting for a long period of time (how often do they touch their face, are they cleaning it properly, etc...). Doing all this would be a minimum to understand mask usage, and even then, the analysis would still likely be prone to bias and unknowns.</p>
<p>My own two young kids wear masks to school for multiple hours each day and their ability to use their mask correctly is extremely low. I wouldn't doubt if its increasing their chance at infection. Thankfully, they are allowed to take it off when going outside.</p>

        <p>You don't need to do a study: ask anyone who is a PPE instructor. People suck at this. And this guy too: <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/do-masks-work/">https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/do-masks-work/</a></p>
<p>&rt;Now I am going to introduce some personal anecdotal information,  through my observations over the last two months. I am still seeing  patients, with maximal precautions, which includes everyone who comes  into the clinic wearing a face mask. I have also been deliberately  observant when I am out in the public (for essential services). What I  have observed is most people not using their masks properly. Many people  have the mask below their nose, which is essentially useless. Or the  mask is on loosely. But far and away the greatest violation of protocol  is that people touch their mask or temporarily remove their mask, and  frequently adjust their mask. This is understandable. Non health-care  providers are not used to wearing masks. They were not trained how to  use them. The masks can be uncomfortable, and whenever you cannot touch  your face, it itches. So people are constantly fidgeting with their  masks.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This may be worse than useless. We now have data of virus deposition  on the outside of face masks, so touching your mask is a good way to  spread the virus. Also, there is the “false sense of security” issue.  People may feel they don’t have to be a rigorous with social distancing  because they are wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>I believe that the ability to properly use a mask could be low overall. If I had to bet money, I would bet that mask usage evaluation from a PPE expert would rank an average mask wearer as poor. I think I remember seeing somewhere that 90% of kids carseats are not installed/used properly. People suck at doing things right.</p>
<p>I think a properly done observational study would be nice to have. Perhaps there is one.</p>

        <p>Definitely on the right track. Run your own observational study of what's going on around you, I've been doing it for months now and it's not hard. Just watch people.</p>
<p>What I've seen is the retailers either wearing masks with valves or the latest trick is to cross the ear loops which causes the mask to bunch up so all the air exhausts out the sides and no filtering is happening. The rest of the public caught on is starting to do it too. Also masks are removed and replaced all the time, stored on the neck, noses hanging out, etc.</p>
<p>It's not pretty.</p>

        <p>Yea, my own observations are all I have. Just yesterday was in a stone/tile store and the employee I was talking to had a full plastic face mask on, but had it lifted up in its resting position.</p>
<p>The vast majority of retail workers are younger so I have some sympathy for what they are going though, knowing full-well that they have close to a 0% chance of death.</p>

        <p>I also have a hunch (without proof) that the virus has weakened since March. One of the first people to die in Ontario was a friend of a friend who was just 52, not obese, but did have cancer the year prior. He may very well have been alive if got the virus today.</p>
