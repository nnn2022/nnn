        <p>why do people keep claiming this without sources? an update implies there’s some type of change. i’ve yet to see anyone provide proof that the WHO changed their stance. it’s somewhat pathetic to see a community of people who routinely blast the media and it’s shit practices engage in similarly shit practices. i’m happy to change my tune and apologize once i see anything that remotely reflects that at one point they explicitly stated children should be vaccinated. i’m not defending the who, and it’s not true they changed their stance. lots of people grabbing at straws and engaging in needless alarmism. if you want to change people’s minds about lockdowns, vaccines, then defer to the multitude of talks by the multitude of professionals from a multitude of disciplines, not shitty gotcha moments that don’t hold up to scrutiny.</p>

        <p>I think there’s a knee jerk reaction when people see the WHO recommending against vaccinating young children on their website, because it contradicts their individual experiences. Parents, people who work around young kids; they’re receiving a lot of social pressure to vaccinate these ages despite the WHO saying it may not be necessary. </p>
<p>Many are being called bad parents or reckless people for not taking their young kids to get the shot. I personally wasn’t aware that this was the WHO’s official stance or when exactly they made that known, but given the perceptions of the mainstream media and many people around us IRL, I am surprised that this is the WHO’s official stance.</p>

        <p>i’m 100% with you, just tired of seeing this shit get spread by people who pride themselves on bearing higher powers of discernment than most. nuance is critical, and this headline i keep seeing has none is totally false. not surprising ultimately but people getting excited about this are wasting their energy because they are not going to be able to supply a source that the who had at one point explicitly advocated vaccinating children, which is the crux of their gotcha moment. people who are brainwashed deserve sympathy as well, not asinine fear mongering.</p>
