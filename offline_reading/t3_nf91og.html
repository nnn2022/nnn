    <strong>Vaccinate college aged kids? You’ve got to be f**king kidding me. Here’s why that’s complete security theatre.</strong>
    <p><p>Doing so has absolutely <a href="https://www.andrewbostom.org/2021/05/dr-andrew-bostom-in-support-of-rhode-island-bill-to-ban-covid-19-vaccine-passports-provides-hard-data-on-convalescent-immunity-to-covid-19-and-asymptomatic-transmission-audio-text-references/">nothing to do with the science</a> - unvaccinated recovered exposure/infection confers <em>more robust</em> immunity than uninfected vaccinated immunity.</p>
<p>There were <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#SexAndAge">2,163 deaths involving covid from 2020-2021 for the 17-29 year old age bracket according to the CDC</a>.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+college+students+in+america&amp;amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;amp;hl=en-us&amp;amp;amp;client=safari">20 million college students </a>.</p>
<p>.0108% death rate/99.99%+ survival rate.</p>
<p>For 95% of covid deaths, there were on average 4 comorbidities (or “additional conditions or causes per death) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">according to the CDC</a>.</p>
<p>College students, FIGHT THIS.</p>
<p>Your vaccination risk is greater than your infection risk.</p>
<p>No conditions or morbidities? You are, for all intents and purposes, at ZERO risk.</p></p>

        <p>Also, a further note on the 95% comorbidity rate per death: they do not detail the age ranges for this, at least not from what I've been able to find. But I am almost 100% certain that each and every death in the 17 - 29 age group had a serious comorbidity. But even if you apply the 95% figure, 5% of 2163 is 108. So the actual infection fatality rate is, at most, 0.00054% among that age range.  </p>

        <p>Plus that's assuming accurate reporting for people who died without a comorbidity. There's been several cases just in my province where someone died of a completely unrelated accident (2 motorcycle crashes come to mind) and it was listed as a COVID death, which would be included in those numbers</p>

        <p>Right. Actually, the CDC's site has a special category listed as "intentional/unintentional events and poisonings". So in other words...murders and accidents [with COVID]. Last I checked, there were some 12,000 deaths listed in that category.  </p>

        <p>This is how they lie about that: they claim "no comorbidity" on the grounds that none was ever formally diagnosed.  The person in those "young person died!" reports is usually obviously 400 pounds once you see their picture.  They get away with that past the "fact-checking" because they hadn't been to a doctor to officially diagnose them with obesity.  Of course it would be fat-shaming to presume obesity if no medical professional had said so.</p>
<p>Once you see the picture of the deceased in any of those media reports, you realize that basically every "no comorbidity" case that wasn't some unrelated injury was really ridiculous obesity.</p>

        <p>They’re using the asymptomatic lie as a reason for jabbing young people, and children. If everyone is a silent carrier then everyone must be jabbed, to protect grandma. Forget natural immunity which most probably already have, you have to take their sub par lab made financial investment instead.</p>

        <p>&rt;I realized "Hey... CoVid is just the usual yearly flu bug. Full stop there!"</p>
<p>&rt;Even when my own parents got this disease and died from it in May 2020, I was sad that they were gone and INCENSED by the medical malpractice on the part of the rehab center my father was in that allowed my mother and I to catch this virus yes.</p>
<p>&rt;However I realized that my personal sadness aside, the truth was still the truth: CoVid was just the usual yearly cold/flu, albeit so contagious that it outcompeted almost all other strains.</p>
<p>I don't understand. How can it simultaneously be the worst illness of your life, be responsible for the death of both of your parents, and require medical malpractice in order for you to catch from a patient filled facility, if it's ultimately just a more contagious version of the seasonal flu? </p>
<p>Like, how could one know the rehab center to be to blame for anyone contracting it if <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nfdbdl/do_health_care_worker_have_to_get_the_vaccine/gykym3d/">both parents worked at Johns Hopkins Hospital?</a></p>
<p>And how could CoV-2 be a particularly contagious strain of influenza, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2">SARS‑CoV‑2</a> is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza">all types, forms, strains, and variants of influenza</a> are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses?</p>

        <p>It can be the worst illness of my life while simultaneously being nowhere goddamned near fatal.</p>
<p>Second, read my post: Medical malpractice and negligence came into this. It was NOT CoVid itself that killed my parents, it was the medical negligence and malpractice, i.e. not using HCQ+Zinc, Ivermectin, Activated Vit. D, etc. on them that killed them along with my father the rehab center he was in after having a coronary triple bypass letting him waste away to near nothing.</p>
<p>Third: They were RETIRED from Johns Hopkins Hospital, something that I mentioned in other posts though perhaps not in the earlier one.</p>
<p>Fourth, the CDC themselves have said that SARS-CoV-2 is just a particularly contagious strain of influenza numerous times.</p>

        <p>We just got a letter from our school district saying it was great news that the FDA had approved the experimental emergency treatment for the 12-17 age group.  Now we are supposed to fill out a form and sent it in to schedule our kids to receive an experimental treatment, and if we dont realize what a super great opportunity it is, we can sign up for counselling for them to explain it to us again.  </p>

        <p>I'd sign up for the counseling and take print-outs of the data from CDC and the actual vaccine companies.  Factual data is all you need, no opinionated stuff is necessary.  Ask them to explain how the statistics, emergency use definitions and legal constraints, and the lack of long term data shows it is a great opportunity.</p>
<p>They'll likely be reading from a pre-determined script and it is very unlikely they'll be able to answer you.</p>

        <p>Yup I can confirm. My University sent out an email a couple weeks ago saying the vaccine was now mandatory. They’re receiving some backlash from students (myself included) but I doubt it’s enough to make any difference. On the one hand I don’t want to touch the vaccine with a 10 foot pole. On the other hand however having to learn through Zoom for another year will probably make me go insane and tank my GPA while dropping out entirely would throw my whole life into turmoil. I can’t win dude. I can’t fucking win.</p>

        <p>Not sure how far into it you are, and what you're in school for, but if you're not too far along and don't want to continue the bullshit, drop out and learn a trade. Be a welder, plumber, electrician, carpenter. College is bullshit. I wish I would have dropped out and learned a trade, instead of getting a bio degree and working for a pharmaceutical company. Honestly I feel a bit hypocritical sometimes, but my company directly makes shit that saves lives every minute of every day, so I can justify it to myself as a means to an end. We're just owned by a big pharma conglomerate. But every day I consider quitting, and I'm working on saving up and positioning myself to be able to quit my job and homestead somewhere with my woman and our animals. Unfortunately have to play their game to get out of the rat race.</p>

        <p>Hi! Currently a sophomore, going to be a junior so although I'm not super far in, I've more than gotten my feet wet. Under many circumstances I would agree with you that college is garbage. I've long been a proponent that some degrees are better than others, and that trade schools are awesome alternatives if you're planning on getting a degree in something pointless. I'm currently majoring in Atmospheric Sciences with a goal of becoming a meteorologist for the National Weather Service so I like to think my path is at least semi-useful with a promising future. Would dropping college temporarily to practice a trade for a few years to make decent money before resuming my degree once this has all blown over be at all viable? I'd be lying if I said I was familiar with how this all works. Thanks man!</p>

        <p>Yeah see that's why I said not sure what you're there for, it sounds like you have a passion and a goal that is achievable and need a degree for, college makes sense for you. I was a lost kid who just wanted to smoke and grow pot, but it was before shit was really legal, so I just got a bio degree (should have done horticulture but I was dumb), and am now stuck in a lab doing work I don't like all to make enough to gtfo lol</p>

        <p>My young friend, listen to the guys below telling you to drop higher education and going into a trade. When you are in your early 20s you think college or uni are the only way to get a good life and a decent job, but it is absolutely not like that and sometimes it is actually detrimental. Unless you have an ardent passion for a scientific topic which can then land you a solid career, you'd be better off doing something practical or technical. Most people end up losing time and money in college and would be better off learning business and/or a trade that can kick-start them into a lucrative career path early on. Nowadays if you really want to go deep into a topic there are plenty online courses anyway, such as those on EdX. College is not the only path, just be aware of that.</p>

        <p>exactly. and it makes no sense because of the two things that they continue to suppress/distract away from: treatment for infection and natural immunity in people <em>who have never even been infected</em>, let alone the recovered. most “vulnerable” people already have robust T-cell immunity. </p>

        <p>My college is pushing the vaccine and is requiring everyone to get it to go to school on campus. It’s a private school. How would I combat this? And don’t say e learning because nobody learns anything from online learning, it’s so hard to pay attention and just isn’t worth anyone’s time. They also release statements that say something like this: “since the CDC has said that [insert what the cdc has said vaccinated people can do now], it is no longer required for the fully vaccinated people to do that on campus. Just a reminder, covid vaccinations are required before August 1st if you wish to attend on campus.” It’s all bullshit and I hate how all these schools follow the CDCs bs guidelines. The data is there and covid doesn’t affect young healthy people. I wish they made it optional. I’m completely healthy I shouldnt have to take a vaccine for a cold and end up getting 7 different booster shots when they come out with those. What could I do to fight it?</p>

        <p>Yea they’re reasonable. My family is pretty open about things like this. They don’t WANT me to have it, they know I don’t really need it since I’m healthy and young. It’s just that they want me to go to college and my college enforces the vaccine, so they’re like “well you’re going to college so you’re gonna need to get it anyway,” that sorts argument.</p>

        <p>I'm in this age group, and sadly I can say they aren't much better than the previous generation. They get the shitty vaccine without asking any questions and don't even think about the risk between getting covid vs getting the vaccine ( the first option being much better than the other). Unfortunately stupidity carries on with generation and though less and less, the numbers are still too great of those who get this joke "vaccine" against covid.</p>

        <p>Agree that it's unnecessary to push vaccination on otherwise healthy college kids, but the "95% of COVID deaths had an average of 4 comorbidities" thing is misleading. This includes both "significant contributing conditions" (underlying, chronic issues) and "chain-of-event conditions" which are conditions directly caused by COVID, like pneumonia or respiratory failure. </p>
<p>The CDC actually does breakdown the contributing conditions by age here: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e2.htm?s_cid=mm7014e2_x">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e2.htm?s_cid=mm7014e2_x</a></p>
<p>Scroll down about halfway and you'll see the table. So if we want to see how many people didn't have chronic illnesses that directly contributed to their death with COVID, you add up "COVID-19 only", "COVID-19 and ≥1 chain-of-event condition only", and "COVID-19 with no plausible chain-of-event or significant contributing condition." The last one meaning the person had another condition but it didn't contribute to the death. Now we see that the overall number of people who didn't have an underlying condition but still died of COVID is 42%.</p>
<p>What's actually surprising is that number jumps up to 60.2% for the 18-29 group.</p>
<p>Still, this means that of the 2,163 deaths in that age group, only about 1,300 didn't have underlying conditions. And considering the vast majority of that age group doesn't have underlying conditions, it means that if you're in your 20s and don't have any known conditions, your chance of dying if infected with COVID is a good bit lower than 0.01%.</p>

<p>All of this is based on just looking at ICD.10 codes and trying to guess what a "plausible chain of event" condition might be.  I'm not wild about drawing conclusions on this data set.</p>

        <p>I haven't really given it much thought. These are the codes listed by the actual doctors reporting the death, not bureaucrats in DC. I think it probably refers to people who, as an example, have high blood pressure and died of COVID, but the ultimate cause of death was respiratory failure and not heart failure. They had another condition, but high blood pressure doesn't seem like a plausible contribution to lung failure/pneumonia.</p>
<p>But again I'm not a doctor so I don't know for sure. It's also a relatively small percentage of the overall death certificates.</p>

        <p>fair enough - i just remember reading on more than one occasion about the incentive of funding/payouts for issuing covid death certificates - i read just today about someone who died of blunt force trauma, it was labeled as a covid death and they tried to appeal but were unable to get that reversed.</p>

        <p>Oh I definitely think that still happened. Just not in huge numbers since it's risky for doctors to do it. And you gotta remember that with 600,000 deaths attributed to COVID so far, even if a small percentage like 2.5% <em>was</em> wrongfully attributed, that's still 15,000 death certificates. That's a lot of lying doctors.</p>

        <p>I’m in Europe and it’s just being ignored. No one is reporting or talking about the fact that more than 10000 people have died in the EU, and more than 400 000 injured according to Eudravigilance. 
And they just keep pushing people to get vaccinated. 
Someone has to take notice ASAP, these peaks are not normal.</p>

        <p>The AVERAGE COVID DEATH IN 2020 had 2.5 COMORBIDITIES. That means (hiv, aids, cancer, severe asthma, diabetes, extreme obesity, etc.) and that's TWO AND A HALF ON AVERAGE (aka 2 or 3 per person who died) Meaning some people had upwards of 4 or 5 Comorbidities if the AVERAGE death had 2.5 (two and a half statistically).</p>

        <p>vaccines just suppress symptoms with 0.7 absolute efficacy; that’s pretty much it. </p>
<p>we know they kinda help you not be hospitalized, but as mentioned in the post and elsewhere in the comments, there are PLENTY none-vaccine solutions to preventing hospitalization.</p>
<p>if you don’t want to get sick and believe the vaccine is your ticket, by all means take it.</p>
<p>but schools MANDATING the vaccine for “safety” is absolutely unacceptable and is all politics.</p>
<p>as the statistics show, college kids just aren’t at risk as a whole.</p>
<p>your degree of sickness btw is uncommon. most 20 year olds are not sick for 2 weeks. idk you or your health so i can’t presume to know why you fell ill (<em>assuming it was covid</em>), but i most definitely wish you well and have <em>zero</em> problems with you <em>voluntarily</em> choosing the EUA experimental therapeutic.</p>
