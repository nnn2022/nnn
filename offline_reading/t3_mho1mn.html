    <strong>You guys give me hope</strong>
    <p><p>So my husband was laid off today. He worked for a company that specialized in cancer screenings but, wouldn’t you know it, the only deaths that matter are Covid deaths. Now everyone is too afraid to leave their homes and realize how sick they really are. Long story short, his company has been losing money for the past year since no one is getting tested and they just had another series of layoffs (I think this is the third round?). </p>
<p>His former coworkers are all doomers that lined up for the vaccine despite many of them catching Covid naturally and “surviving” it (they also mask still, so that’s simultaneously hilarious and pathetic). His CEO wanted to force everyone in the company to get the vaccine but couldn’t in some places due to “laws not allowing it.”</p>
<p>While it sucks that my husband is out of work for the time being, it’s probably a blessing in disguise that he’s being forced to get out of that dumpster fire. Hopefully the other people being laid off wake up to how we’ve all been complicit it letting government restrictions and media-driven fear porn absolutely wreck our economy. </p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted to thank you all for being voices of reason through all this insanity. Keep fighting the good fight!</p></p>
