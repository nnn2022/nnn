    <strong>Scary hours</strong>
    <p><p>I can name 7 people that I personally know that have taken the vaccine and were hospitalized for either experiencing heart problems or for “unrelated” health concerns, including cancer. Not a coincidence. I can name 1 (one) person that has been hospitalized due to covid, and that person was 100% normal, 2 weeks after their release from the hospital. Im the only one who hasn’t gotten the vax out of all my friends, so this is one of the few places where I feel I can speak my truth. One of my close friends was one of the people who was hospitalized shortly after getting the jab, but I don’t see myself bringing up that interesting sequence of events to him because I have no idea how he’ll react. The next few months are going to be interesting, but sad, bc more and more people are gonna die and it won’t be from covid, even thought that’s what the media will tell you what happened</p></p>

        <p>I'm concerned with the 'plug and play' nature of these 'experimental mRNA gene treatments'.</p>
<p>The shot tells cells to turn into a printing press of a spike protein, which amounts to only 'partial' protection against covid19, while a traditional vaccine would give a FULL sample of the virus to teach the immune system proper and full protection.</p>
<p>It's just so unnatural and meddling with the body through science, most people must not even understand the process that they'd be so quick to take it</p>
