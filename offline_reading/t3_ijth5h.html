<title>Here's an uncontroversial doctor reviewing a new retrospective study showing that the much-hated HCQ may decrease deaths in hospital by 30%. This middle-of-the-road video was DVed in two other subs. Are you as surprised as me?!</title>

        <p>Itâ€™s actually very disturbing how the politics around Trump poisoned the research or lack there of  around this medication.   It should not have mattered what he said, one way or the other.</p>

        <p>I am posting this here because there continues to be an irrational movement against this ... old medication ... simply because Trump promoted it. The doctor even touches on this briefly -- the unusual "hatred" of this drug.</p>
<p>I'm posting it to highlight how you probably <em>won't even hear about this</em> anywhere else. It got crickets and was downvoted to zero (!!) on r/Coronavirus (<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ihu9l6/hydroxychloroquine_evidence_of_efficacy_sources/">link</a>) and r/CoronavirusUK. </p>
<p>The underlying study is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920303423">'Low-dose Hydroxychloroquine Therapy and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Nationwide Observational Study of 8075 Participants'</a>.</p>
<p>This doctor is not "on our side" in any meaningful way; that's what makes it important. He is doing his best to analyze medicine as medicine, whatever his <em>beliefs</em> are.</p>
<p>If I ever get coronavirus or someone close to me does, I am going to ask for low-dose HCQ to be started immediately, with zinc and vitamin D (which the doctor discusses in other videos). The preponderance of evidence suggests that these treatments <em>will help</em>. Isn't that what the world wants??</p>

        <p>I would call him PHD instead of doctor. Otherwise I agree.</p>

        <p>Oops. I had no reason to think he wasn't a doctor. The title of his youtube account; and in the video he refers to "not writing prescriptions any more", I think, to paraphrase. Apparently he's an advanced nurse, who in whatever locale might be able to write prescriptions.</p>
<p>My opinion of this fellow just went down.</p>

        <p>This is where I diverge from some in this community. I don't really understand why we need a particular drug to be the one that works. I've seen several studies suggesting HCQ has minimal to negative impact. Why are we still on about this?</p>
<p>The main thing we should be focusing on is the fact that COVID-19 is not nearly as dangerous as the media is making it out to be, NOT that some drug Trump was pushing may or may not work.</p>
