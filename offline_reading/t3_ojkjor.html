    <strong>One thing that's been on my mind is how insurance providers are handling the Covid Vax. I don't have all the answers, but here's what I've noticed:</strong>
    <p><p>From what I've personally observed, we may be able to get some insight of the risk-benefit analysis from Insurance companies. These people are true experts at analyzing info in a non-biased manner. Left or right doesn't matter. Money is what matters to them. It's funny that life insurance companies aren't giving discounts for vaccinated people (as far as I know). They are the ones who actually care if you die because they don't want to pay out. They want to give you as many tools as possible to keep your ass alive so they don't have to pay. I have a "wellness plan" that I have to participate in as a condition of my life insurance. It's extremely intrusive. I have to answer health surveys every month that go into incredible detail of all aspects of my life, including mental health, level of physical activity, etc. There were even a few where I had to list every single type of food I eat, including condiments. I could go on and on about how detailed it is, but you get the point. You would think this plan would be pressuring me to get Vaccinated. Nope, not a word about it. They are the ONLY ones who don't mention it. Why do you think that is? The truest, most honest statistics are the ones gathered by someone who is evaluating financial risk.</p>
<p>Does anyone in here work in insurance? If so, how are they treating this situation? I remember at the beginning of "the pandemic", I thought insurance companies would go bankrupt for having to pay out for mass deaths all at once ðŸ¤£. </p>
<p>And what about health insurance? I wonder if anyone who's been injured from the vaccine is having trouble getting their insurance to pay for the aftermath.</p></p>

        <p>I have been saying that the simplest way to get more people vaccinated is to jack up health insurance premiums on those who are not. I donâ€™t know why the Government has not pushed this option. Maybe they are still waiting?</p>
