    <strong>We The Human Beings</strong>
    <p><p>We the free people of Planet Earth have a message for the governments, banks, 0.01% of globalist elites and the banks.</p>
<p>We choose our government, we choose to elect you and gave you power. We purchased your products and made you rich. In return, you track us, feed us poison, inject us with synthetic genetically modified organisms and chemicals. You betray us, backstab us, cage us, manipulate us, aim to enslave us, erase our individuality, destroy our families and friends. </p>
<p>You aim to control us, divide us and destroy our lives, liberties and businesses, so your owners and friends can profit and rule this planet. You create chaos and pose solution. You create viruses and your owners create vaccines. You create proxy wars and our brothers bleed so your friends can profit.</p>
<p>We know the names of the families, you can't hide.
We know the names of the clubs, you can't hide.
We know the names of the corporations, you can't hide.
We know you, we know your agenda. You can not hide.</p>
<p>We will take our freedom back. We will liberate ourselves and this world from the grips of your greed and Ill intentions. You will pay for your crimes no matter how rich you are.</p>
<p>WE THE HUMAN BEINGS. 
WE ARE ONE.</p></p>
