    <strong>Anyone in Tennessee?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m wondering about the nonsense level here.  How are the elementary schools now?  How are the stores/restaurants?</p></p>

        <p>I'm wondering that too because it's a close second choice after Texas, I like the people there</p>

        <p>I’m in the eastern part of Tennessee. The schools lifted all mask mandates in my county (and several surrounding counties). I feel like most people aren’t wearing masks anymore. It’s just about like normal I feel like sometimes.</p>

        <p>IIRC, the TN courts recently said that school boards requiring masks for children were "acting outside of their statutory authority."</p>

        <p>I'm considering TN as well, only because it's closer to me than FL for the purpose of not taking my kid too far from his Dad. I'm trying to stay in NY as long as possible because of this, but it's not looking good here.</p>

        <p>Our school still has a mask requirement, but I can’t see it standing for much longer. With only 2 weeks of school left, they probably won’t lift it now, but I doubt it will be in effect for fall. My kids are reporting the teachers have been very lax about enforcing it lately which is nice to see attitudes shifting. Our elementary kids have been full time in person the whole year, middle and high school went back to full time in person in Feb/March. I feel the schools have been pretty reasonable and non political about it, especially compared to where we came from. We’re are in E TN and relocated here from CA in January. It’s been awesome, we absolutely love it. I homeschooled our kids in CA for years because I wouldn’t subject them to the indoctrination. We tried the public schools here and I’ve been very pleased that they are not overwhelmingly leftist and stick to education. Absolutely beautiful scenery and wonderful, kind people. Like living in the 90’s in so many ways. The only place we’ve worn a mask is the doctors office and walking into Costco  in the almost 6 months we’ve lived here. Kids have never worn them outside of school. Never had anyone hassle us. Id say it’s about 20% of people in masks now, unless you go down to Knoxville. It’s a big city so not surprising, but still we don’t mask there (except for stupid Costco) and no one has bothered us. We looked all over the country and are very happy we chose E TN.</p>
