<title>I see people shocked that the vaccines don't stop the virus. Let's not forget that the vaccines were never meant to stop it. From Fauci himself “What I would settle for, and all of my colleagues would settle for, is the primary endpoint to prevent clinically recognizable disease.” AKA symptoms only.</title>

    <strong>I see people shocked that the vaccines don't stop the virus. Let's not forget that the vaccines were never meant to stop it.

    <p><p>From October 2020 from this article : <a href="https://bgr.com/science/coronavirus-vaccine-efficacy-explained-fauci-interview/">https://bgr.com/science/coronavirus-vaccine-efficacy-explained-fauci-interview/</a></p>
<p>"Dr. Anthony Fauci explained in an interview that the actual goal of the early COVID-19 vaccines <strong>isn’t even to block infections</strong>, a detail that people should be aware of even before considering whether to get a vaccine or which vaccine to go for. Instead, scientists are aiming to prevent severe COVID-19 cases or stop symptoms altogether. <strong>The virus would still gain entry into the human body</strong>, but vaccines will stop it from replicating and <strong>prevent symptoms</strong>, including life-threatening complications."  </p>
<p>" “The primary thing you want to do is that if people get infected,  prevent them from getting sick, and if you prevent them from getting  sick, you will ultimately prevent them from getting seriously  ill,” Fauci said during an interview at <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fauci-vaccines-will-only-prevent-symptoms-not-block-the-virus-195051568.html"><em>Yahoo Finance’s</em> All Markets Summit</a>  on Monday. “<strong>What I would settle for, and all of my colleagues would  settle for, is the primary endpoint to prevent clinically recognizable  disease</strong>.” "  </p>
<p>"Should these vaccines effectively prevent symptoms, then patients might <strong>still be infected and they would still test positive</strong>."  </p>
<p>Remember when they tried making asymptomatic people the enemy and how they were the ones spreading the virus to everyone and had to be stopped and everybody was forced on lockdowns? Remember when friends and family or complete strangers were calling for death for those who were asymptotically spreading the virus and killing grandma? Well the vaccine is only meant to turn people into asymptomatic cases, which most people were already to begin with if they even caught it. It's interesting since they are now trying to push this "pandemic of the unvaccinated" for being the leading cause of cases, deaths, and transmission while highly guarding what they consider to be "breakthrough cases" since that would show the vaccine doesn't work and it doesn't prevent death.</p>
<p>That's gotta be a hard pill to swallow for those who actually believed in whatever they were told and who took the jab without question.</p>
<p>Virus gonna virus.</p></p>
