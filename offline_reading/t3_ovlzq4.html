    <strong>Changing jobs during the state of terror</strong>
    <p><p>Recently I accepted a new job offer.</p>
<p>When I did so, the situation was significantly better.
There were no discussion on mask mandates, no plans or legal framework for firing the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Since then, it has become accepted for employers to demand vaccine certificates, make public (internally in the Company) lists  of people that are vaccinated and those that are not. </p>
<p>I do not know how my next employer will react to my "status", but I do not plan to discole this information unless I am forced to.</p>
<p>I have never been an activist for a social or political cause, and did not plan to do so in my life. However, I have realised that if I would lose this job (that I have worked very hard for, and made significant sacrifises) due to me being unvaccinated, I will have little to lose. </p>
<p>I think there are millions in my position. I have energy, means and thirst for revange to dedicate myself to fight against this unjustice.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated have been silent for most part, or silenced. In many countries we are still the majority. Lots of lives to be interrupted by new mandates all over the world. At some point there is going to be pushback.</p></p>
