        <p>I mean we <em>know</em> that when you attack someone's identity, they just dig in. That's why half of us are here lol.</p>
<p>Stone's "Policy Paradox" really opened my eyes to the power of narrative. Think about the narrative that red team and blue team craft on their news networks: </p>
<p>1) the average joe on the other team is a demon trying to kill you. </p>
<p>2) The way to discuss ideas is to come with a list of facts, nevermind that no one ever changed their mind or their internal narrative by being argued with (hearing others argue is a different matter).</p>
<p>3) So they sell you the narrative that you need to argue with a list of facts. Meanwhile there's so much information out there that both teams can have a list of true facts to back them up.</p>
<p>The sum total of all this is that no one ever changed their mind and they feel entertained, but never successful, in exercising this false "agency.</p>
<p>And red team and blue team, and their affiliated corporations, each maintain a permanent 50% market share. Something any salesman would sell his left nut for.</p>
