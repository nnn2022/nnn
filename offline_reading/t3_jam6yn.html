        <p>Covid didn't become a deadly virus until after the media got ahold of it. It's so deadly that we didn't even realize anything was wrong while it was here.</p>

        <p>I think Seattle as well, I live in the area and since that was the “first” US case city it just goes to show how much those people were already traveling to and from the area. A lot of my family and friends were sick in November/December and tested negative for flu/pneumonia.... just kind of interesting!</p>

        <p>Absolutely. Its contagious as fuck. No way it all just magically started in March. People had it and were probably told it was a bad flu by the doctors if they had to seek treatment. The unfortunate deaths were probably just contributed to pneumonia</p>

        <p>Pretty sure my husband brought it back as a Christmas present from his mod December Shanghai trip.  This isn't a hard concept - as you said, we live in a globalized world and I guarantee it was already making its way across the world by the time China even discovered it.  It's the lack of interest on the part of the "experts" to make any real efforts towards identifying when it was here, how widespread it is/was, what percentage of the population has already been exposed that concerns me.  This isn't about health and it isn't about science, otherwise we would care about getting to the bottom of this.</p>

        <p>COVID was definitely around before New Year's Eve that's for sure. How would they know who the original patient is? There is literally no way of tracking it back to the very first person. Hell, the first person could have been asymptomatic and went around spreading it without any knowledge whatsoever. How would they find this person? This whole thing is a joke, really.</p>
