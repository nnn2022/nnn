    <strong>How do we tell the difference between someone having the flu and someone having covid?</strong>
    <p><p>I keep seeing how "Flu cases are down because we are social distancing and wearing masks" as if that's just a matter of fact. But I struggle to see how we even truly know who has the flu vs covid.</p>
<p>It's already known that PCR tests aren't really reliable and that's what's being used to determine if someone has covid. Do these tests differentiate between the flu and covid? How? Is that reliable?</p>
<p>I see the below from the CDC which says there has been a test that was authorized for emergency use back in July 2020 that does this discernment, but does anyone know if this is actually being widely used?</p>
<p>I'd love input from anyone who's knowledgeable because I don't think it can just be said "restrictions help with not spreading the flu" without knowing how the tests are conducted.</p>

        <p>It's pretty easy. Just ask "Is there anything to gain from it being Covid?"</p>
<p>If yes, then Covid.</p>

        <p>I work in a lab and analyze both, influenza and covid. Our lab uses antigen combo POC-tests that look for both, influenza and covid (also few other respiratory viruses). I know that similar combo kits for rt-PCR are used also, just not in our lab.  POC-antigen tests are known to be somewhat inaccurate. About PCR, it really depends on the CT value you get.. high CT value means high chance of false positive.   </p>
<p>Antigen tests: "Antigen tests Sensitivity varied considerably across studies (from 0% to 94%)" <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32845525/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32845525/</a>   </p>
<p>rt-PCR:  "false positive results may instead arise chiefly as consequence of extended Ct, far beyond the recommended threshold of 30-33. Other causes of false positive results include wrong timing, cross-reactivity among SARS-CoV-2 and other Coronaviruses." <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/False_positives_SARS_CoV_2_RT-PCR_test">https://www.researchgate.net/post/False_positives_SARS_CoV_2_RT-PCR_test</a>  </p>
<p>Hope this helps :)</p>

        <p>PCR as a technology is more than capable of distinguishing even very similar strains, which flu/sars-cov-2 are not.  This does rely on the protocol being well designed, which is questionable in this case (look up the analyses of the drosten paper used as the template for the WHO protocol).</p>
<p>Still, it's likely that the sars-cov-2 pcr assays are specific enough to miss the flu.</p>
<p>It has been established in medical literature going back 50 years that flu strains and other diseases can push each other out as dominant infections.  Strains can lie quietly on the sidelines until immune systems are again more susceptible to them.</p>
<p>It's also possible that those being tested (because cdc claims they're running lots of tests) are from a very biased selection and thus not representative.</p>
<p>The answer really is that we don't know.  Science packed up and left in 2020, and the data we have been gathering and sharing is an absolute mess, so it's hard to draw any quality conclusions.  Whether this is by design or gross incompetence is unclear.</p>

        <p>RT-PCR only tells you if the swab picked up a bit of RNA.  That's it.</p>
<p>It's QUANTITATIVE not QUALITATIVE.</p>
<p>Besides, ANY test since September 2020 has been considered a CASE no matter the final result, so it doesn't really matter anyway.</p>

        <p>&rt;PCR tests aren't really reliable </p>
<p>They are to reliable. That is kinda problem, since it may come up as positive long time after the person is infectious. Awesome minutephysics video on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ_8b_Ydsv0<br>
Also the flu generally coming from the other side of the world every flue season, that is why can we prepare for the correct strain of flu just in time. Since travelling is restricted (besides masks etc.) influenza has less chance to spread.</p>
