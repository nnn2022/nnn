    <strong>Philosophy discussion: is contagious disease a morale failing?</strong>
    <p><p>Growing up, getting sick was just part of life and even though sometimes maybe you might get mad at your friend for "getting you sick", you wouldn't really hold them responsible because you know they didn't choose to get sick and suffered as well.  </p>
<p>With Covid now however, contagious disease is no longer seen as an inevitability to being a morale failing for the person who becomes sick because they are now liable for the others who will get sick down the chain.</p>
<p>If avoiding contagious illness is paramount to society how do we continue to be social creatures since we can never be certain that we are not a threat to those around us?</p></p>

        <p>You might enjoy The White Castle by Nobel Prize in Literature recipient Orhan Pamuk, which deals some with this question. The translation from Turkish is pretty easily accessible. In my opinion the answer to your post's question is a clear "no."</p>
