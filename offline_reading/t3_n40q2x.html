    <strong>Covid control freaks</strong>
    <p><p>I am usually not a confrontational person, but there’s been 2 separate times that people have made me get angry. Y’all can decide which person is worse.</p>
<p>Story 1: I’m waiting outside to schedule a doctors appt. There is a 4 person limit on who can be in the room. So a lady which I’ll refer to as “Karen” tells me there is 4 people in the office and I have to wait outside. So I play on my phone and I get impatient, as I just need to schedule a meeting. I go inside while Karen tells me, “you still can’t go in, there’s 4 people inside!” I ignore her this time. Of course, nobody cares in the lobby that there is now FIVE people as I sit and wait. Karen comes in like 5 minutes later and out of nowhere, tells me “that wasn’t very nice of you to BARGE in there while I’m waiting”. “It’s rude of you not to follow the rules...” I just end up being passive aggressive/sarcastic and tell her to have a good day.</p>
<p>Story 2: I’m working out at the gym. Unfortunately I am at a gym where masks are required. This situation is going to make me switch and just spend the extra money because it’s not worth it anymore. So I’m working out and the attendant comes up to me pointing at the mask above his nose. I can’t hear him at the moment and mind you, when he does this, I HAVE MY MASK ON. Sometimes I pull it down below my nose when nobody is around to you know, breathe (or drink). Anyways the guy tells me “it goes over your nose”. I say it is over my NOSE, with a confused look. He responds, well I saw you with it down earlier. WHAT. I didn’t even know how to respond. What makes a person that they have to go out of their way to interrupt someone over something as stupid as that. I was kinda pissed at this point as I say I was probably drinking as the attendant walked away.</p>
<p>I just needed to get those stories off my chest. I don’t agree with everything posted here, but I am just so tired of people and how they think they should have control over others because of stupid things that don’t matter. Not only do I have antibodies but I have also been vaccinated (I know that’s controversial here). I want to make a shirt that says immune, or immune and vaccinated so people can just mind their own damn business.</p></p>

        <p>As a frequent at the gym in New England I feel you pain entirely. I got kicked out from my gym for my mask slipping down MID SET. There is this one person who’s literally job is a mask checker and she just stares at you and waits for the second that mask goes anywhere. Typical bully who needs to feel empowered by ruining someone’s day and annoying them. Side note she’s a fat fuck who’s never worked out in her life and she says to “suck it up” when I complain about wearing a mask while doing a 5x5 squat. Yeah ok</p>

        <p>I had my first sort of experience like this today. I was walking to class and passed a little table type setup with these two people. It’s about the vaccine of course. I’m walking by and they go “Are you vaccinated” and I look right into their eyes and go nope with a smile! They just looked so confused as I never stopped (they expected me to be like nope and run right over to their little table) and they go “wellll wait don’t you want to?!” I stopped walking and said “Absolutely not.” While glaring right into their eyes. They both just had a look of not even anger but just total shock and confusion as if I was walking away from a briefcase with a million dollars.</p>
