        <p>Initially the CDC and OSHA both believed that masks offered significant protection to the wearer. That was a year ago. Both the CDC and OSHA both now believe that masks offer protection to others. </p>
<p>CDC: "Masks substantially reduce exhaled respiratory droplets and aerosols from infected wearers" <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7007e1.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7007e1.htm</a> </p>
<p>OSHA: "The main <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html">function of wearing a face covering</a> is to protect those around you, in case you are infected but not showing symptoms. Studies show that face coverings reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth." <a href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework">https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework</a></p>
<p>Before people comment asymptomatic spread doesn't exist, you are infectious with most viruses before you are sick because it can take 2 days for the immune system to recognize the virus (which is when you first get symptoms).</p>

        <p>The CDC has the answers to these questions:
The diameter of the coronavirus - 1-2 microns
The diameter of the pores of the lungs - 2-10 microns
The diameter of fabric masks -  150-200 microns.
The time a 100 micron liquid particle takes to hit the ground - 10 seconds.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that many people can not think about those undisputable facts and understand why fabric masks are nothing but degrading filthy face rags.</p>

        <p>That's true, the CDC study I sent was using surgical masks as the primary prevention of the spread of aerosols, not just cloth masks.</p>
<p>It's a shame they didn't do this study sooner.</p>

        <p>You're wrong on your definitions. Being asymptomatic isn't the same thing as showing no symptoms. Being asymptomatic means you came in contact with the virus, but you did not (and will not) contract the disease from it. Those who show no symptoms immediately before contracting the disease are not considered to be asymptomatic.</p>
<p>With that said, it is theoretically possible for an asymptomatic person to spread the virus, but it's very unlikely. The way that respiratory diseases spread is through the manifestation of symptoms, such as coughing and sneezing. That is well established science.</p>

        <p>Maybe my definition is wrong? I'm seeing conflicting definitions online. Merriam-Webster says asymptomatic means "not causing, marked by, or presenting with signs or symptoms of infection, illness, or disease". Which I guess would include both my definition and your definition.</p>
<p>I found a <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article">CDC study</a> that uses the term "Presymptomatic", which would be a more accurate term with what I meant when I said asymptomatic. They even explained how some people confusingly included presympomatic spread into asymptomatic spread. I will use presymptomatic from now on.</p>
<p>Contract vs. contact is also an iffy definition because it relates to illness. Some bacteria can be "contracted" without causing any symptoms, or the symptoms may not be noticeable. But you are right about asymptomatic spread, it is not a contributing factor to the spread of coronavirus (from the CDC study). Presymptomatic spread is much more likely.</p>
