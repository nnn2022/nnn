<title>The last resort of a pro-lockdown person in an argument is “BUT BUT the refrigeration trucks!!!”. My question is...is there any evidence that refrigeration trucks are somewhat common in places like NYC? I’d assume a lot of people die who aren’t claimed.</title>

        <p>You can find lots of stories about earlier use of refrigerated trucks.  it's not so rare.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.healthy-holistic-living.com/opioid-addiction-crisis/">Opioid Deaths are Leading States to Rent Refrigerated Trucks Due to Lack of Storage Space</a></p>
<p>&rt;Since 1999, opioid overdose deaths quadrupled, as did the amount of prescription opioids sold in the U.S. All of these pain relievers did not equate to equal amounts of pain relief, however, as Americans reported pain levels stayed steady during that time.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Meanwhile, death rates from overdoses of oxycodone, hydrocodone, methadone and other prescription opioids also quadrupled since 1999. In some areas, such deaths are becoming so commonplace they’re overwhelming coroner and medical examiner systems.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Some Areas Are Looking Into Renting Refrigerated Trucks to Store Bodies. 
&rt;. 
&rt;In Connecticut, the chief medical examiner has considered renting a refrigerated truck to store bodies because the storage space at the medical examiner’s office is often maxed out.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The space shortage is attributed to rising drug overdose deaths, including opioid overdoses, which are pushing many medical examiner and coroner offices to their limits.</p>
