    <strong>"To attend the in-person meeting, registrants must be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus."</strong>
    <p><p>It's already starting here. The stamp club never responded when I wrote them and said they should not institute vaccine passports on people. Sadly I think they are going to go that way. I can tell for multiple in-person events, the nonvaccinated are already being banned. This was another event I would have been interested in until I saw the rules. </p>
<p>I went on my facebook and saw people ranting against the unvaccinated today too and how "dangerous" and "evil" we are. This is by a person who got the J&amp;J and still supports that, even though that vaccine was "paused" for blood clots. </p>
<p>I am talking to husband about moving to a free state trying to warn him of what is coming. I am not sure he is going to listen. I talked him into avoiding vaccines, but I know he is surrounded by other voices including the best friend who lined right up and ignored everything I had to say. The two women who got neuropathy from the Covid vaccines and still supported the vaccines scared me. I left things polite what else could I say?</p>
<p>I can already see that being denied medical care is next on the list and told husband our liberal church is probably going to ban the unvaccinated too from any future in-person meetings. [of course I have the worry the vaccinated are shedding the spike proteins, don't know if this is true or not]</p>
<p>I said no to dinner plans with the vaccinated people over fears of the spike proteins, but felt I had told too many I was unvaccinated, two-three people and didn't want to add others. The social ramifications of Covid true believers finding out you were unvaccinated and to come around them would be very bad news. </p>
<p>People are happy to "ban" the unvaccinated now. My state is scary now. Very scary. </p>
<p>No one cares about someone with extreme disabilities many that show. I don't trust my doctor anymore but fear not being able to get medical care, and don't know how to find a doctor that questions the vaccinations, probably few and far between. </p>
<p>This is the nightmare that will never end it seems. The Covid vaccines don't provide immunity and don't stop transmission but all these people seem to believe they do.</p></p>

        <p>Fuck, I'm sorry to hear that, OP.</p>
<p>In complete seriousness, your state sounds like the beginning stages of an honest-to-God apartheid regime.</p>
<p>And it's funny you should mention disabilities, since for a lot of autistic people (myself included), the muzzles are literal torture devices. I ignore the signs on the occasions where I do go out, but I have been told that "my kind" isn't welcome before.</p>

        <p>Yeah it's getting bad here. I started crying and told husband. I said "Maybe we should move to South Dakota". He's lived in this state all his life [well except a few years in another state] and I can tell does not want to leave, however he told me if things get bad enough we would leave if we have to. I just don't want us waiting until it's too late. It does sound like it's going into an apartheid regime. </p>
<p>I am on the autistic spectrum myself too, and yes the muzzles wear me out too, took me months to even get used to them to even wear them for around an hour. I could never handle hours in them. I have COPD too, never smoked in my case and they make me constantly short of breathe as well.</p>
