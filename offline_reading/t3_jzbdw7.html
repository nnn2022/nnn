    <strong>Can you name me a single aspect of the COVID crisis that lived up to the government or medical hype-aganda?</strong>
    <p><p>From the criminally-inflated Imperial College projection numbers, the fatality rates, mask effectiveness/ safety, age and ethnic demographic casualties, the use of traumatising fear tactics over scientific data, outrageous and unsupported claims of transmission methods...</p>
<p>Meanwhile near 100% recovery rates in the healthy under-70s and genuinely avoidable lockdown deaths are un(der)reported and case numbers quietly replaced COVID deaths many months ago. Meanwhile every positive aspect of our culture is eviscerated by ‘preventative’ measures that actually and provably harm us all. Still no mention of genuinely sensible precautions, such as vitamins and supplements.</p>
<p>I will not claim that COVID was fabricated, much like I wouldn’t claim the annual/ seasonal flu is a fraud, but can someone tell me the difference between the two, by any metric?* The WEF Agenda can ably explain why we reacted the way we did this year, as opposed to every other preceding year.</p>
<p>And yet there are those who will not and cannot see through such an obvious scam. Perhaps it’s the sheer audacious scale of the deception that continues to throw some people. Goebbels had something to say about that, if I recall.</p>
<p>If you are elderly and vulnerable, go ahead and take the flu and COVID vaccines if you like. But for those who are not, why risk your bodily integrity, health and fertility on a 99.5% recovery rate when Cochrane estimates vaccine damage in 2.6% of us (200 miliion people worldwide)?</p>
<p>* Besides flu fatalities decreasing globally last season by 98%.</p></p>

        <p>The levels of fear and panic people exhibited in the beginning was definitely on par with or exceeded whatever the government predicted. That’s how we got into this mess in the first place; panicked people accepted, even demanded that the government take away the rights of others for their own safety.</p>

        <p>Yes yes yes! If the populace at large would have stayed calm and collected, I believe life would be normal right now. I remember going to the grocery when we were told we were going shut down and everything was fucking gone. Even the nasty food that no one in their right mind would want to buy. </p>
<p>The officials saw the response and have ran with it.</p>

        <p>The USS Comfort didn't see COVID patients because refused to see them and only acted as additional critical care capacity. City hospitals were left to setup their own extended capacity, e.g. the tents in Central Park outside Mount Sinai main. These were used for weeks. The Jacob Javitz Center took overflow from hospitals across the five boroughs.</p>
<p>What about the refrigerated trailers that parked at all the NYC hospitals to act as necessary expanded capacity for the city morgues? Mount Sinai Queens, a tiny community hospital in Astoria, needed two trailers. Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan had over a dozen.</p>

        <p>I know the Comfort wasn't for covid patients. My statement still remains that it saw very limited patients. Morgues weren't accepting bodies so the hospitals didn't have anywhere to store them.</p>
<p>I used to work in a hospital a couple years ago. The morgues in most hospitals don't have space for many bodies to begin with. They're only meant to stay for a few hours before they're picked up usually in the morning. </p>
<p>I currently work in Manhattan and still have contact with my buddies at a hospital in Yonkers who told me how much of a joke this all is.</p>

        <p>Cool story. My wife is an RN in Queens and worked through the pandemic. Her emergency room was routinely over capacity (\~50 beds, census over 100) and she watched people fucking die night after night.</p>
<p>The field hospital in Central Park <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/nyregion/coronavirus-central-park-hospital-tent.html">saw over 100 patients in the first two weeks</a>. The Javitz Center treated over <a href="https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-nyc-update-corona-virus-cases/6142109/">1000 patients in a month</a> before closing down.</p>
<p>The refrigerated trailers weren't just about hospital capacity. It was about morgue capacity at the <strong>city level</strong>. NYC has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/us/makeshift-morgues-coronavirus-new-york/index.html">morgue capacity of roughly 900</a>, and needed to expand that to \~3500 via the trailers. I'm not sure why you're able to call out the stressed morgue capacity without making the logical next step to "this isn't normal".</p>
<p>Your "buddies in Yonkers" can't offer up the universal experience. Neither can I, but I'm also not going to call 20000 dead people in NYC a joke, or anything resembling routine.</p>

        <p>Exactly! I ask doomers exactly what the "experts" got right and they have no answer. They give the excuse that the experts are "learning" yet this virus isn't that dissimilar to any other respiratory disease, hell TB is more lethal and infectious than covid, smh. What the hell do they need to learn about if that's the case? </p>
<p>Then I have to hear about the longterm effects which still aren't known in reality because we've only been aware of this "novel virus" for less than a year. It's fucking complete and total bullshit.</p>

        <p>it was a hoax just face it.
yes people took money and doctored death certs
yes the media made up numbers
its never been isolated and there is no reliable test.
its a straight scam people need to just face up to that already. we been getting hoaxed on stuff for years and years but cause people do not want to face up they have to justify it to themselves that "oh its just not as bad as they say" or some crap
face reality already its a scam, there is an agenda, there are occult networks that coordinate behind the scenes, that is reality.</p>

        <p>About the only thing I found to be true is that it does spread a lot faster than the flu. If one person gets it, it’s likely others will too. But the death rate is lower than the flu from what I’ve heard.</p>
