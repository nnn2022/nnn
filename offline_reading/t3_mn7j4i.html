        <p>Lmao 14k deaths annual is an epidemic? Does this mean car crashes are epidemics? Alcohol poisoning? Christ obesity is leading cause of more than 300k deaths every year</p>

        <p>I agree with you I think it is wild that we would call this an epidemic but he did so you know Joey B. And the gang are at it again lol </p>
<p>Outside of my agreement I do think gun deaths amount to more than 14k but still not enough to be an epidemic even if it was it just isn't an epidemic that is crazy.</p>

        <p>14ish thousand annual is excluding suicides. Including suicides the number jumps to 62ish thousand, which is still less than car crash fatalities</p>

        <p>That makes sense, I wouldnt  include suicides in the count. That suicide or I should say multiple murder suicide in Texas was crazy though I guess that double counts. </p>
<p>Mental health is the problem, which I know makes people sound like broken records but guns don't kill people, people kill people. When everyone gets locked up for a year and goes crazy bad things happen.</p>
<p>Edit: spelling and clarification</p>

        <p>I think they will go for Climate Change as the next "Public Health Crisis."</p>
<p>They rely on the police, FBI, ATF,  and other alphabet agencies to employ force on behalf of the government.  Those blue collar workers face the daunting prospect of trying to force confiscation of a heavily armed population that knows what's at stake. I don't think a gun grab is iminent.</p>
<p>Climate is way easier to shame and guilt us, and fleece us for more money.  Anybody with a big pickup or SUV will have a new tax, and be labeled a social pariah.  "How dare you drive an internal combustion vehicle?"  If you don't install the thermostat that limits your AC to 80 degrees or your heat to 65, you are murdering a future generation.  Install the solar panels, bigot, it's only $40K--think of the children!</p>
<p>Those can be advanced gradually, boiled frog style, with no violence--and plenty of crony industries and corrupt kickbacks.  That's how they will bilk us of $5-$10 trillion more.</p>

        <p>That is already happening with the milage tax. I live in a rural area it is 30 minutes by car to get to town for the gym and groceries. A milage tax is only going to hurt people we don't live in cities or who try to get away. </p>
<p>I dont think it has to be one or the other.  The idea that people will stand up for thier rights while 80% of the population is against them becuase well if it saves even one life clearly hasn't played out the way you or I would have hoped. (I am not speaking for you but given your participation in this sub I think our views around this might align)</p>

        <p>I respect a truck driver way more than any politician.  I'm killing it right alongside you by driving an SUV and putting lead into the ground at my local gun range from time to time.</p>
<p>Crazy thing is, I teach my kids not to litter, and always leave campgrounds cleaner when we depart, than how we found them.  I teach them to not waste electricity or hot water, and not to kill anything unless you are going to eat it--save parasites like mosquitos, flies, rats, etc.</p>
<p>I bet if we planet killers actually led the planet, it would be a pretty good place.</p>

<p>Indeed.  That's why I hate to see the cucks in the pro-gun-but-actually-anti-gun lobby whimper, "We need a national database to keep the mentally ill from getting guns. You wouldn't be against <em>that</em>, would you?"</p>
<p>Why yes, yes I would.  Why?  Because it won't take long before they decide that, oh, I don't know, denying climate change gets classified as a mental illness, or being heterosexual, or not separating your green glass from your clear glass on recycling day, or not liking the President.  The list goes on.  Assure me that this won't happen and I still won't believe you.</p>
<p>Remember guys, up until fairly recently, homosexuality was officially considered a mental disorder.</p>
