    <strong>I can’t go a day without being shamed for not wanting to get vaccinated right now</strong>
    <p><p>These past two weeks especially, every single person I’ve talked to whether it’s parents, friends, coworkers, people I’m meeting, etc. have brought up getting the vaccine in some way. </p>
<p>My response to them is always, I support your personal choice and will support you in getting the vaccine or not. Yet on the other hand, I get a barrage of comments about how I need to trust science, there’s nothing wrong with the vaccine, it’s good enough to take, I’m being a “conspiracy theorist”.</p>
<p>The one that gets me the most is when I’m told that I’ll eventually be socially isolated. When people find out that I’m not vaccinated no one will want to be around me. That one kind of hurts the most and really opens my eyes about the world in it’s current state. I fear for a society split by vaccinated and non-vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Believe me, I’ve seen how COVID has effected people, families, businesses, the list goes on. But, I always say (and have since the start) that I am skeptical and nervous about getting injected with a rushed vaccine. I state that they need a certain amount of people to be vaccinated and that I’m ok with not being in that number due to my age and level of health. I try to be as rational as possible, but am constantly met with the ridicule.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the rant but I’m so exhausted and I’m tired of walking on eggshells just talking to people. I hope I explained this well enough in a way that others can relate to. Curious to know what everyone’s experience has been like talking to people about the vaccine.</p></p>

<p>a lot of the damage you’ve experienced here is due to lack of cunning. adapt.</p>

        <p>This is a valid point. I think the worst part has been people I generally feel comfortable sharing my opinions and thoughts with I’ve had to battle with on this topic. Probably best to just keep things to myself at this point.</p>

        <p>i shouldn’t blame the victim (you) here. just be more cautious, because it can come back to bite you. </p>
<p>it’s sad that people we once looked at as friends or family have been completely lobotomized by state propaganda.</p>

        <p>My own dad did this to me a few days ago on the phone. Just out of nowhere. And when i said "nah im good im not sick" he began shaming me. The propaganda machine is strong. We ran from communism. Now he is starting to embrace it slowly again. This propaganda shit is really deep and strong man.</p>

        <p>Actually, they don't have to know if you're vaccinated or not. With all the respect all your medical procedures are between you and you doctor.</p>
<p>So, my advice don't even discuss it with them.</p>
<p>I know it's hard, but they need to learn to respect your privacy. And actually for you it would be easier to stop them there, because if you would start to explain yourself, why you prefer not to get vaccinated, you put yourself in defense position, and it's very hard to win this argument unless you don't care about those people and can tell the whole truth...</p>
<p>So my advice, stop it there, don't even enter this vaccine discussion, it's between you and your doctor. Period.</p>

        <p><strong>Tell anyone that shames you to Google "pfizer criminal history"</strong></p>
<p>These companies all have a long history of putting profits over people, so it's completely rational to say "no" to taking a new, experimental vaccine.</p>
<p>Another important thing to know is -- you don't owe anyone an explanation as to why you do or don't want it. It's your body, your right. Your life. It's a private matter, and it's bizarre that people want to get all up in your personal health matters.</p>
