    <strong>Am I the only concerned by what this contract means?</strong>
    <p><p>I've read end-to-end several times this contract (which is available since the end of May): http://ti-health.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Albania-Pfizer.pdf</p>
<p>and I can't believe this didn't create more outrage anywhere... am I understanding this wrong?</p>
<p>I'll outline the important parts and what I understood.</p>
<p>&rt; Section 2.1.b: Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) Pfizer’s efforts to develop and manufacture the Product are aspirational in nature and subject to significant risks and uncertainties...</p>
<p>So, no commitment that the product will reflect the claims.</p>
<p>&rt; Section 2.1.c: ...the Parties recognize that the Product has completed Phase 2b/3 clinical trials and that, despite the efforts of Pfizer in research, and development and manufacturing, the Product may not be successful...</p>
<p>They're making sure that the Purchaser is really aware that it might not work.</p>
<p>&rt; Section 2.8.d: Without prejudice to Section 4.4, Purchaser acknowledges that Pfizer will not, in any circumstances, accept any returns of Product (or any dose).</p>
<p>Section 4.4 is about non-complying product in the manufacturing sense. Thus, they're making it clear that they don't promise anything about what the product is supposed to do (which is a theme that appears too often for my taste in the contract).</p>
<p>&rt; Section 5.5: Purchaser further acknowledges that the long-term effects and efficacy of the Vaccine are not currently known and that there may be adverse effects of the Vaccine that are not currently known.</p>
<p>The other sections were an introduction to what they were really aiming for: not that the product might not work, but that it may cause harm.</p>
<p>&rt; Section 6.2.a: Pfizer may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Purchaser in the event of a material breach by the Purchaser of any term of this Agreement...</p>
<p>No surprise there. There was a categorical "NO" by Trudeau, when the Canadian's provinces ask to see the contracts.</p>
<p>&rt; Section 8.1: Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Pfizer, BioNTech...</p>
<p>I think that this is the most reveling bit: the Purchaser is bound by contract to become Pfizer spokesperson (not that it matters that the Government is supposed to represent the People).</p>
<p>&rt; Section 9.5: Purchaser represents that it has and will continue to have adequate statutory or regulatory authority and adequate funding appropriation to undertake and completely fulfil the indemnification obligations and provide adequate protection to Pfizer and all Indemnitees from liability for claims and all Losses arising out of or in connection with the Vaccine or its use.</p>
<p>Essentially, it furthers the idea that the Purchaser must be at the mercy of Pfizer by making sure that all its power is dedicated to protect Pfizer interests (seriously, WTF).</p>
<p>I don't know if this contract is representative of all other contracts between Governments and Pharmaceuticals, but it would explain a lot of what we're seeing. The Government is allegedly bound by contract to make sure that everything from messaging to law enforcement doesn't cause harm to Pfizer financially. If financial harm of any form happens, Pfizer is free to pull out from the contract without losing a penny and no obligation to deliver the product. Then, compound that to the fact that people of power might really believe that the only solution is to put all of our chips on the vaccine: what's the worst that could happen? Well, that something that actually works both as a preventive and a treatment and is cheap and easy to manufacture with a pretty good track record of being safe comes to light: such as ivermectin.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah it’s the greatest example of extortion today. There’s also a clause in it that states that the government must provide legal representation, or fund it, for Pfizer in the case of a lawsuit. </p>
<p>Meanwhile you have doomers gaslighting people about how it’s all typical legal stuff. Maybe 90% of it is, but the 10% that isn’t should scare enough people. The United States government has hunted mafias down for less.</p>

<p>Yep, I've post this stuff on /r/ivermectin and people were arguing that this is business as usual. Although, a lawyer jumped in and said that he saw infrastructure contracts in the past, but never something that was decided by the supplier like this one is.</p>

        <p>Typical agreements these days signed by governments as proxies.</p>
<p>"Purchaser" in this agreement is "Albania Ministry of Health and Social Protection, acting on its own behalf and on behalf of the Republic of Albania"</p>
<p>However, pfizer makes the purchaser to acknowledge,</p>
<p>"Purchaser has the authority to bind the Republic of Albania"</p>
<p>If product succeeds, pfizer profits. If it fails, government will use taxpayer funds to cover costs. If government was person with a conscience, they'd never sign such one-sided contract.</p>

        <p>Everyone who doesn't work for Pfizer should be. Hilarious how the media, politicians, and npc's say it's safe and effective while the creators of the product won't stand behind what they've made.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this.  It is insane.</p>
<p>The WHO corporation's defined term "pandemic" strictly serves to activate, upon "declaration" of it, these sleeping contracts bw registered municipal corporations doing business as "state of X", "republic of X", etc (vs. X state or X republic which are the actual governments) and pharmaceutical companies.   Meanwhile people hear "pandemic" on tv and associate it with some netflix preprogramming movie - they have no idea the term being used strictly relates to the activation of these contracts.  Instances like this contract are a great help in walking them through the ugly truth.</p>
