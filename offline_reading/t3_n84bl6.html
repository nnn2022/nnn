    <strong>War Story</strong>
    <p><p>I'm inspired to write this by a couple of similar posts on this sub.  I still wear a mask where required.  I am now on the fence on the vaccine, although I might have to for employment purposes.  But I respect people who don't wear masks, and I respect people who won't get this vaccine.  I pretty much respect anyone who doesn't push their agenda on other people.</p>
<p>So this is about my grandparents, my grandma specifically.  They raised 7 children during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands.    I always tried to ask my grandma questions about it, but she never wanted to talk about it.  I asked her specifiically if she hid anyone in her house during the war.  (They were Catholic.)  She said, "Everyone in the village knew who was hiding people, and no-one ever said a word."  And then refused to say anything else.  </p>
<p>The government policy was to to hand the Dutch Jews over to the Nazi's.  And there was a lot of pressure on the people to turn in their neighbors (think, Anne Frank).  They used fear, and shame, and skewed information.  Propaganda.  They turned neightbor against neighbor.  Family against family.  Does that sound familiar?</p>
<p>I am starting to really understand my grandma.  I understand why she couldn't wait to leave.  I understand why she wouldn't talk about it.  I understand why she wanted to live in the US, as it was US soldiers that liberated her village from the Nazi's.</p>
<p>I am so tired of the government rule by shame.  Government rule by withholding information.  Government rule by saying the word "science" and then doing the opposite of what science detemines.  I am so incredibly lucky to have my grandma as a role model.   I will work hard to make her proud.  I will figure this out, and do what I can do to make a difference.  I am not an angry person.  But I'm starting to get angry.   I know I am not alone.</p></p>
