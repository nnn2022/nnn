    <strong>Annoying posts about positive experiences with jabs</strong>
    <p><p>I don't understand why people post that they got the jab and didn't keel over and that they're somehow an anomaly --- Hey it didn't affect me, I'm fine! All is well. </p>
<p>The truth is that we can't see what's going on inside the body but we do know that spike proteins <em>are</em> being produced in all parts of the body and accumulating in organs such as ovaries, brain, kidneys and liver. This is proof that manufacturers lied, as they claimed the spike proteins would localize near the lymph nodes near the injection site. Of course from animal studies they had to know this wasn't true.</p>
<p>So these proteins are on the cells of these organs and also on cells which line the blood vessels and the body wants to fight them as foreign pathogens. That is why blood clots are happening. This is very concerning. So people should be cautious about bragging about having no ill effects because they could be coming and these posts are basically encouraging people who have never done the research to get this dangerous injection.</p></p>

        <p>How long has it been since the vaccine opened to age groups under 65? Three months? And the CDC is already holding an emergency meeting over heart disease linked to vaccines.</p>
<p>Wait a year or two and see if those people feel the same way. By 2025 people will be demanding Big Pharma's head.</p>

        <p>I’ve watched a ton of videos about spike proteins but the one I watched last night by Dr Tenpenny was really informative as she broke down in steps how the spike proteins work and what they do to the body. She estimates we will be seeing major illness among the vaccinated within the next 14 months. Some are experiencing it right away and for some it may be months from now. When I see posts saying they they got the jab and are fine I feel sorry for these people because they have no idea what’s in store for them in the coming months. A normal vaccine/medication takes 12 years to hit the market. These vaccines took a year. Major corners were cut.</p>

        <p>Yes, it really has me worried for people and especially the push to get children injected. And the sad thing is that many are taking it for the wrong reason -- the false belief that everything returns to normal once enough are injected. So it's coercion and the tyrants never had the right to take away any of our freedoms over a cold. They abused their authority. I can't believe what's happening to our societies. They've done so much damage.</p>

        <p>It all feels so unreal. It’s like a bad movie. The elites are trying to take over the world. DC politicians on both sides of the political spectrum are worse than crime syndicate families. There are more of us than there are of them. This is why it’s important to stand our ground and keep fighting. In my area most people have ditched the masks and ignore the BS. My family is all on the same page (even the younger generations) as they know what the real agenda is with all this madness. My hope is once the vaccinated start getting sick, and begin to realize the shot is dangerous, they will finally start to wake the hell up so everyone can start working together to take back our countries from these criminals.</p>

        <p>The polio vaccine was developed in 1955 using your logic with this one could say “how do we know side effects don’t start at the 67 year mark”. What we know about vaccines and how they work is that some future effect are not a concern based on all of the best medical science.</p>

<p>You try to be all technical to convince people you know what you're talking about but you are a liar. Spions aren't safe. PEG isn't safe. It's well documented that the spike proteins are cytotoxic. And they're being found all throughout the body. People are dying. Healthy people are suffering strokes, brain bleeds, risks of prion disease, parsomia - the Covid death smell, heart attacks, blood clots, brain fog and on and on. And why are you using a throwaway account if you're such an expert?</p>

        <p>Aw yes the “VAERS report” the statistics that have  been inaccurately cited on Facebook and Instagram as evidence that Covid-19 vaccines are causing thousands of deaths, a claim not supported by US health authorities' investigations. You mean that hahahaha</p>

        <p>Health authorities like CDC - a non-profit agency that benefits financially from the sale of "vaccines"? VAERS reports are historically under reported, but you probably already know that. Keep pushing your poison, servant of satan.</p>

        <p>Yes, people are bored so they go in there and make things up. Just stop already. You are way behind. It's common knowledge now that these concoctions are dangerous and deadly. I am sorry you were duped into taking it but you need to face reality.</p>
