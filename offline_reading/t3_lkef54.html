    <strong>Children vs The Experimental mRNA Gene Treatment</strong>
    <p><p>With Israel threatening to roll out the mRNA offering from March for children and U.K. ministers talking about September possibly, it is clearly time to start organising.</p>
<p>Since there has been no public mRNA testing on children thus far, it would mean this roll out IS the continuation of the meagre Phase 3 trials in field test form. Who would volunteer their child for such an experiment?</p>
<p>“Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to be tested on children”:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/296778">https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/296778</a></p>
<p>“The trial, which will enroll 300 volunteers, will take place in three English cities, London, Southampton and Bristol, the statement added. The inoculations are expected later in February, it said.”</p>
<p>I can just about understand those heroic idiots who volunteered for the adult testing last Summer, but it’s an altogether different thing to be offering up your own child. Not so heroic. What incentive would you accept?</p>
<p>We know that children are ALWAYS the most susceptible to vaccine damage. We must stop this happening. Most are utterly unaware of the experimental nature of these new COVID ‘vaccines’ and consider them as ‘safe and effective’ as the old attenuated versions (which we at least KNEW were neither). This time round we have a big blank to work with.</p>
<p>I simply don’t know. Neither do you. Neither does Pharma. Let no one tell you otherwise. Everyone seems to prefer NOT to know. It makes sense for Pharma’s plausible deniability, but why does the average citizen choose not to delve deeper? Do they still believe, despite official announcements, we’ll get the Old Normal back?</p>
<p>Love to hear how you guys feel about this imminent roll out to kids.</p></p>

        <p>It’s a crime against humanity. Of course, right on schedule for their flourishing agenda which is being not only accepted but begged for by the general population. Astonishing to me how Israelis can blindly accept medical trials on their own children after they watched what Mengele did. History rhymes, don’t it???</p>
