    <strong>Are you People acctually having different opinions here or is this an Anti-Covid channel?</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone,
I stumbled upon this sub, but at first glance it looks more like a collection of anti-covid propaganda than anything else.
Is this a place where people discuss, or are people screamed down that all statistics are fake when comming up with scientific links?</p>
<p>Hard to find people to discuss with, that are not completly trapped in their pro- or anti- agenda.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></p>

        <p>It's a mix of reactionary memes and middle of the way discussion.</p>
<p>For example, I'm a person that believes corona virus is real, <em>effective</em> masks worn properly can help reduce the spread of it, 5G/microchip bs is complete nonsense, that our government would have been better off locking things down harder than they did a year ago, and I'm vaccinated</p>
<p>However I'm also 100% against forced vaccinations and vaccine passports, I don't wear a mask because there's no mandate where I live + I'm vaccinated, I never stopped going outside or seeing friends and family in 2020, and I  realize a lot of our methods are pure security theater (like entering restaurants &amp; bars with a mask then taking it off at your table).</p>
<p>Sadly most subreddits would rather ban you than allow you to exist in any sort of gray area.  If you're not totally for lockdowns and forced vaccinations you're banned from coronavirus, if you sub here you're banned from covidvaccinated, etc.  </p>
<p>So this is one of the only high traffic subs left for me since I don't care enough to make a new username.  But that's typical reddit, its just one of the things you have to  deal with by participating in this website.</p>

        <p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I was aware of the severity of the situation in China in November, so obviously our government was too.</p>
<p>We should have locked down international passenger flights prior to Christmas 2019 for starters.  Holidays be damned.</p>
<p>Instead even in <em>fucking march</em> you could still go to capacity bars and get shitfaced for st. patties.  It was <em>absurd.</em></p>
<p>At that point it was 100% impossible to contain.  They dropped the ball completely.</p>
<p>For the record I was one of the only people where I live to wear a mask in <em>2019</em>, and same for January - the first half of March 2020.</p>

        <p>I don't know what you mean by "anti-covid." Are there "pro-covid" people running around proclaiming the benefits of covid?</p>
<p>What this sub is "anti" is the belief that the world cannot go back to the way it was in 2019. We believe that the faster we do get back to normal, the faster all of this mess will be over.</p>

        <p>I'd say that every single individual has their own viewpoint and perception of what is going on related to covid.</p>
<p>I certainly do not subscribe to everything that anyone says here.</p>
<p>But this is one of the few places where different opinions coexist.</p>
<p>Of course there's also something that most people here have as common denominator. And that is questioning the proportionality and/or duration of the measures.</p>
<p>From my perspective they seem highly disproportionate and this perception makes me want to speculate about possible explanations for that. I'd like to speculate without becoming the target of insults, toxicity or outright being silenced.</p>
<p>I don't have an agenda. I just want to be left alone by a society that suddenly started claiming that I'm incapable of taking responsibility for my own health and must be forced to do what they think is the right thing.</p>

        <p>Why you say Anti-Covid, I don't think many of us at all dismiss Covid as being fake.</p>
<p>Yes most of us rail against the vaccine, but a moment of clarity will set anybody straight.</p>
<p>EUA, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization">Emergency Use Authorization</a> Leaves Big Pharma in a position where everyone is a test subject. under no penalty of law if everything goes to shit 2-20 years down the road.</p>
<p>These big pharma companies cannot be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_pharmaceutical_settlements">trusted</a>, do we know what kickbacks are, yea paying doctors to push their product even at the risk of horrible side effects, and knowingly doing so. Indeed even under strict control they manage to find a way to increase the bottom line occasionally at the expense of human lives.</p>
<p>Gov't is bankrolling Big Pharma at the moment, there is a saying since I was a child. "Want to get rich build a better mousetrap, want to get filthy rich sell it to the Gov't.</p>
<p>in 1986 I joined the US Army, during basic training we had to have every inoculation there was, they lined us up and bam bam bam, every time they told us what that shot was and what is was for "A form of forced informed consent" except the last guy, he simply said "We have no idea what this is for but you likely won't get sick very often" turns out that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/jul/30/internationalnews#:~:text=The%20illness%20known%20as%20Gulf,a%20new%20series%20of%20tests">shot</a> may well be what's fucking up my life so much, was the gov't my friend in this, NO, do they still fight against any responsibility, YES..</p>
<p>I love my country and swear I'm willing to die for it's people, of all colors and nationalities, but and let me emphasize this.. I DO NOT NOR WILL I EVER TRUST OUR GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>So if you want to line up for an experimental vaccine under EUA, great, have fun. But understand a vaste majority want just a couple things to happen IMO. </p>
<ol>
<li>Remove Big Pharma's Immunity, for obvious reasons.</li>
<li>Gov't needs to stop bankrolling Big Pharma, with little to no oversight. Big Pharma has simply found a way to make the Gov't its personal advertising agency, its called Propaganda.</li>
<li>An Independent panel to actually investigate all these "Not Vacc deaths" on VAERS.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck, fruit didn't bear from the tree until 20 years later, hopefully your not on that next wave of class action lawsuits because long term side effects destroy your quality of life.</p>

        <p>God forbid we be "partisan" about defeating the biggest lie ever told. There is no more time for "fence sitting". You are either down with the tyranny or not. There are no facts worth discussing surrounding all this. Facts don't matter, the government officials have made that abundantly clear. You don't defeat the enemies of free people everywhere by worrying about whether or not you're too opinionated about it.</p>
