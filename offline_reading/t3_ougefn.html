    <strong>What do you think is the endgame for COVID-19?</strong>
    <p><p>Okay, sorry for the long, rambling type of post.  </p>
<p>I have been thinking about this a lot, and I need to get some answers before I can even consider vaccinating or not. Wanted to make this thread to help me(and others as well) think on a larger scale. The question is - WHY all this is happening? I warn you that this has a pretty conspirational tone, but I guess that this sub does not mind it. Here are some of the presuppositions I have made:  </p>
<ol>
<li>The elite do not care about human lives unless they contribute to increasing their power via wealth and support.</li>
<li>There has been corruption and abuse of power (there has also been good leaders) as long as people have lived. Our time is not different.</li>
<li>Controlling peoples thoughts and actions on a grand scale is more efficient than ever in our history. Leadership is also more subtle - no more kings and queens, who claim to be the sovereign leaders without question. It is prime ministers and presidents, who are loyal to bankers, who are loyal to X, who are loyal to Y... Which takes us to the next point.</li>
<li>We do not really know who is in charge. (This is actually symbolized by the floating top of the pyramid with the eye in the US-dollar. The top of the pyramid is separated from the bottom.) However, who does our leader submit him/herself to? Is it a grand life philosophy characterized in God? Is it another, more powerful human? Or is it Satan? How can we determine our leaders success, if we don't really know what is their goal? Only ongoing goal that I can see clearly getting executed by our leaders, is to increase the power and control of the people.</li>
<li>The elite is global and work in unison. The whole earths economy runs on US. Dollar (which contains the floating pyramid top symbolism). You can say that the world submits itself to the ideology of the dollar.</li>
<li>Human society is supposed to provide its residents identity and higher purpose while the residents concentrate their power(work, taxes) for the society to have more power. That way it is a two-way-trade. We are living times where the people on bottom of the pyramid are losing their identity and unity - this is a known sign of breakdown. This is also a symptom of the "divide and conquer" tactic.</li>
<li>There are too many people on Earth. We cant reduce it "naturally" by warfare, since it startles people and victory may provide people with too much sense of power and unity. Maybe people would stop fearing death - which is used to control people. Why would you risk your life for the better world, if your highest value is being alive?  </li>
</ol>
<p>Ok, maybe there are some other ones, but i'll leave it here. This is my take on what is the reason for COVID-19 pandemic:  </p>
<p>The people in charge have created a society where people generate wealth for them endlessly and increasingly. The elite are hidden, nobody knows who they are and nobody even cares. The elite feel very safe and powerful - almost any policy can be executed without fear of blowback. The people at the bottom of the pyramid are having all their material needs satisfied, so they would never question their servitude.  </p>
<p>However, lately we have seen the breakdown of society taking place - people are losing their unity and we are getting polarized and torn apart. So, what does COVID-19 have to do with it? I think that this is a final way to lock in our servitude to the current system. The plan is here:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Create a virus which has mild symptoms, mutates controllably, but spreads rapidly.</li>
<li>Let the world get infected.</li>
<li>Create a solution for the virus - a vaccine. The solution should remove the symptoms but must not erase the virus entirely - the vaccinated are supposed to get infected and spread the virus. </li>
<li>Virus should mutate so drastically in the long run, that peoples own immune systems can't learn to defend against it without exterior help. People should take the vaccine everytime when the virus mutates too much to participate in the normal society. Maybe every 2,5,10 years or so.</li>
<li>The unvaccinated are not dying at first. However, when the virus gets too mutated and vaccinated people are keeping up with the mutations with the jab, but still spreading the virus, the unvaccinated are dropping out of the race.</li>
<li>Now, we have a society where you can FULLY control who participates in it - and these people are those who trust the system. If you take the vaccine and "trust the system", you may participate in the society. If you do not trust the system and you refuse to take the vaccine, you will die or live in exile until you die. And the system itself does not have to do the killing - the virus is an exterior threat, and the system acts as a savior instead of the perpetrator. It is a pretty genious system actually, albeit evil to the core. I know this gets thrown in a lot, but it really resembles a lot like the mark of the beast.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Let's say I believe this to be true. In this case, I'm not sure at all if I should take the vaccine or not. If I wanted to change the society, I would want to be alive for it -&rt; take the jab. And if I chose to refuse, I would live as an exile out of the society. I have kept these thoughts very much secret, and I have no closed ones who doubt the vaccine, so if I chose to live in exile, I would be alone. What would you do in this case?  </p>
<p>What do you think? Do you have own scenarios, maybe less conspirational? Or even more conspirational? I would love to hear them all.</p></p>

        <p>Thats ur mistake. They dont need you.</p>
<p>They need <em>someone</em> but not 8 900 000 000 of them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The more people there are the harder they are to control. You can fool all of them for a time, you can fool some of them for all time, but you cant fool everyone for all time.</p>
<p>Thats happening now:<br>
Conspiracies becoming more popular with the population and at one point, when too many people dont believe you you have a breaking point, you cannot control them anymore with the lies u used to be able to control them.</p>
<p>Solution:<br>
kill most of them and let a small bunch survive cause a smaller amount is easier to control (around 500 000 000 at absolute maximum, just take a look at the georgia guide stones)<br>
They tried to create war with Russia and China, but that didnt worked out for one reason or another, so they are now trying the same with the "vaccine" and the COVID "pandemic". How fortunate that the covid restrictions will likely break out a civil war across europe and USA which will likely kill a lot of people.</p>
<p>Additionally:<br>
Imagine if the TOP dogs, the absolute elite is convinced that the earth cannot hold that many humans, that we are "overpopulated" its a lie but they themselfes are convined its true and they are telling us that at least since a few decades via Blockbusters, School, media in general...<br>
Thats how they are able to overwrite their conciousness. The evil has to wear the clothes of good after all.</p>

        <p>No matter what you do, you can be sure this is not going to end at least for a couple of years minimum. Lockdowns/curfews and restrictions will be intermittent. The old normal is just a memory. So vaxxed or not, we are not going back to normal.</p>

        <p>I have come to accept this... But I'm troubled on how should I navigate myself in these very distressing times? I know that this plan is doomed to fail at some point, but will I live through to see it? Maybe not. Can I be a source of light in the darkness? Can I help myself and others to carry on and spread hope instead of fear? Certainly... but it sure is hard.</p>

        <p>It cannot possibly last due to just how unnatural it is. The duration is an unknown. But mother nature doesn’t work in mystery, it is pretty straight forward and all the above scenarios are well thought out in our imaginations but is still an unnatural and evil occurrence.</p>

        <p>Hate to say it, but I think we have to go full Alex Jones, here: it's likely an intentional depopulation scheme. I think that the most powerful people on earth have come to the conclusion that it would be a lot nicer if it were less crowded, less ugly, less polluted, and so on.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that there are slow-burn plans in place going back several decades to decrease birth rates through both social and chemical means. Why they're escalating now is anybody's guess. Maybe guys like Gates are getting old and just want to enjoy their retirement. "Get off my lawn" on a global scale. Who knows.</p>
<p>At any rate, I think that's the scenario that fits most closely with the evidence. It was obvious very early on that the goal was going to be mandatory vaccines, and it was also obvious that the powers that be were aware they were going to have severe side effects. If it were just about money and control, you would want a safer product; arranging for legal immunity for vaccine manufacturers months in advance and announcing a new "deadlier" strain of virus right after the vaccine becomes publicly available (to have a scapegoat for adverse reactions and to encourage greater uptake) are two massive red flags.</p>

        <p>Before september 2020 I thought this was ushering in the Great Reset the WEF has been talking about for a while. Financial system meltdown, debt forgiveness at a planetary scale, rearrangement of power relationships... hopefully without actually getting to an armed conflict of sorts. This combined with total and absolute control of the state+corporations machine on all people, via the "vaccine passport" app which would have been made mandatory and would slowly morph into China's social credit score system.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p><em>There's actual harmful shit in the vaccine</em>. It's not just a pretense in order to have everyone use their social credit score app. There's <em>harmful shit</em> in those vials.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>When we know the answer to that, we will be able to see where this goes for real.</p>

        <p>People would go on strike in the U.K. as I’ve asked plenty of different people in different jobs if they’d forced to get the jab, there answer was no. Young people of the U.K. aren’t daft and are seeing tic tok videos of adverse effects from it. So if people go on strike then they can’t really win as it costs millions in lost revenue. They want us all in fear, as we without fear then you’ll never completely comply.</p>

        <p>The question is, should I buy in to the deceit or not - is the outcome of refusing to be deceived more harmful than living in the truth. Can I live through to see the truth getting unveiled by temporarily letting myself get deceived? Or will I merely die on my hill without making any difference if I refuse?  </p>
<p>True red/bluepill question. It's not easy.</p>

        <p>Deep down I know this to be true. But I do not have enough power to change me or my close ones... I have a wife who I love, but she understandably considers our rulers to have higher authority over me. I also have two very dear children with her. My realizations about the state of our existence have appeared after we got settled and I was as gullible as my wife when we met, so I have pretty much driven myself in a dead-end with this. I have tried to convince her, but she is pretty much committed to the blue-pill.  </p>
<p>Living in the truth would pretty much force me to leave my wife and my children. I think I would most certainly lose my soul and salvation when leaving my children without a father/mother.  </p>
<p>Very hard situation. I would pick the truth in a heartbeat if it was only about me.</p>

        <p>I replied this to another comment, but I would refuse to take it in a heartbeat if it was all about me... but I suspect that I am pretty much in a situation that I would have to leave my beloved wife and children if I chose to rebel.
