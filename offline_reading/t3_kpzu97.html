    <strong>Covid has made me hate people. Trust me when I say I didn’t think I could hate them more.</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve always been a bit of a misanthrope. I like the idea of people more than the reality of people. I like/love individuals, hate people. This covid bullshit has really put my hatred at a 10. I hate politicians for the lies and hypocrisy. I hate  doomers for pushing masks, lockdowns, and vaccines. What I didn’t expect, is who I hate most are the sheeple blindly complying. They are the worst offenders and they are the majority. </p>
<p>This shit ends when we say it does. </p>
<p>Everyday I get braver about pulling my mask down indoors. I stood outside Ikea (waiting to get in) mask-less the entire time. Every single person in line (outside mind you) had a mask on. My husband kept asking me to put one on (he gets embarrassed) and I absolutely refused until we got to the door. Then I wore it incorrectly (just over my mouth) the entire time. No one said shit to me. </p>
<p>Every time I go out I will push back a little more. I’m not going to argue with people in public, I’m going to pretend they don’t exist. Because to me, they don’t. If all those assholes dropped dead tomorrow from covid, I wouldn’t give one single. solitary. fuck. </p>
<p>Thank you for reading my eulogy to the last shred of my humanity.</p></p>

        <p>In nearly every human disaster throughout history there have been people who come together and sacrifice their time, money, energy, and sometimes even their lives to help those in need. Somehow COVID is completely different though?</p>
<p>You ever think that maybe all those people are still out there, still being just as selfless as humanity has shown its capable of in every disaster before this and maybe its you who has it wrong? Maybe wearing a mask and not throwing parties until the vaccine is distributed is how an everyday citizen can help their community?</p>

<p>Those don't really read like the words of someone who is looking to help people. Sounds like someone who is trying to dehumanize people so its easier to hurt them without feeling guilty.</p>

        <p>Do you understand how math works, because when you say its like seasonal flu it doesn't sound like you know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>COVID has about a 2% fatality rate (lower in less at risk groups, higher especially with age but averages to about 2%)
If 50% of Americans get COVID that would be 3.4 million dead (340,000,000 x .5 x .02).
When these numbers were made known (in February after information from China was released) the stock market dove off a fucking cliff and do you know why? (This was before any lockdowns and before we had more than 100 cases)
It wasn't because of any lockdown or mask mandate, it was because people who understand these numbers realized that once COVID got to the US it would be the biggest disaster both in human lives and in financial cost since WW2.</p>
<p>If you think major investors are going to pull all that money out of the market because of seasonal flu you're delusional.</p>

        <p>Do you have any studies or sources to back that up? Because based on all official numbers I can find of both the US and other countries places it at around 2%</p>
<p>https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker</p>
<p>You guys sit in here and pretend this is some conspiracy to control people by making them wear masks and stay inside but every country that has successfully pulled off these policies is doing much better than the US both economically and in number of deaths. </p>
<p>This whole subreddit seems like a bunch of people that just want to believe they are somehow smarter than both the masses and experts and people who are so selfish that even in the face of a national disaster won't wear something over their mouth if they think they are being "told" what to do. </p>
<p>When you grow up and become adults you'll realize that one of the downsides that come with all the nice benefits of living in modern society is that freedom comes with a responsibility to your fellow humans. You having to wear a mask while you buy groceries so other people don't die is not oppression, thats just how communities are supposed to behave in these circumstances.</p>

        <p>Yes; you should use IFR as a measurement rather than CFR. CFR will always overrepresent death rate unless you believe that</p>
<ul>
<li>100% of Covid-19 infections are detected, and</li>
<li>There is no overrepresentation of Covid-19 deaths (while there is plenty of evidence that there is, especially since the criteria is openly "death within 28 days of positive test"... <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">with only 6% of deaths having no other comorbidities...</a>), and the cold/flu have mysteriously vanished</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf">As per the WHO, the IFR has a median average of 0.27%</a></p>
<p>When you grow up you'll realise the many pitfalls associated with a group approach to health. If I'm responsible for your health then I want you to take every step to improve it, for instance; no smoking, no alcohol, no drugs, no fast food, no late nights, and you are required to exercise for hours a day. This will actually improve your (and the publics') health considerably more than the lockdowns (which will actually reduce it).</p>

        <p>Plandemic. If you can't see that the stock market isn't a gauge of economic health, but rather a cause then you're deluded. It's all connected.  The classification of certain deaths as caused by covid, the media fear mongering, the people who want to sit at home and complain. It's all connected. </p>
<p>It's fascinating to watch. The same people who think big business is a negative are the same ones willing to roll over and watch as big business takes over. Corporate States of America here we come.</p>

        <p>I didn't say its a gauge of economic health, I just noted that there were trillions of dollars pulled out of the market after the COVID numbers were released and the people who pulled all that money out are not stupid. If it was just a new flu, that would have been a very stupid thing to do and they would have lost a lot of money.</p>
<p>There were ways to prevent big businesses from flourishing during COVID while the rest of the economy went to shit (giving most of the stimulus directly to people and small businesses instead of corporations, not bailing out companies that performed stock buybacks in the past 4 years, mandatory hazard pay for frontline employees, etc) but conservative politicians fought against these suggestions. </p>
<p>The US is already controlled by large Corporations, but its not because of people wearing masks and following social distancing guidelines during a pandemic. People listening to medical experts who are trying to prevent the deaths of millions of Americans are not the ones responsible for the downfall of this country.</p>

        <p>Deaths of millions is basic math. 2% fatality rate times 170 million people(half of US population) is 3.4 million dead. We obviously will be under that by the time most people are vaccinated, but that is what we were facing if we did nothing.</p>

        <p>I’ve always liked people. I’m so incredibly disappointed. This is how people let the Nazis take over. I grew up in the US during the Cold War. I was probably fed propaganda. I have this idea that nobody in a communist country could trust anyone. People would rat out their friends and neighbors for a little more toilet paper. I’ve met people who lived through that but I never asked them. </p>
<p>I feel like the only sane person in a crowd of deluded people. Like an atheist in a fundamentalist tent revival. Not even people in my own home agree with me.</p>

        <p>I have said it many times this last year. I used to hate slavery. Now I hate slaves too.</p>
<p>You cannot make a free man into a slave. You can make him your prisoner, but he will always be agitating and resisting and planning. He will always struggle against his shackles and foment rebellion. And if ever he breaks free, he will harm or kill tyrants, or unable to do that he will escape to freedom.</p>
<p>Slaves need no bindings. They fight, kill, and die for their masters. They hate freedom and justice.</p>

        <p>Slaves aren’t the problem per se; the real problem is the slave mentality.</p>
<p>That’s because slavery is an external condition imposed by others through force, whereas the slave mindset is a self-imposed condition of the mind.</p>
<p>It’s important to make the distinction, because freeing minds is significantly harder than freeing bodies.</p>

        <p>I couldn't agree more. I'm just angry and in disbelief all day, every day at politicians who get on TV and argue for the removal of people's rights and freedoms, and people who follow the "rules" and defend lockdowns and all this other fascist nonsense blindly.</p>
<p>Masks specifically isn't something I care that much about though. I follow the local law to the letter, which is to wear a face covering when <em>inside</em> stores. </p>
<p>The hill I am willing to die on and will gladly take on every single braindead fuck on is the travel restrictions we have here in Ireland (5km currently), the police checkpoints all over town to enforce this instead of dealing with actual problems, the delay of any and all medical checkups and procedures that aren't Covid, forced closure of businesses and offices and the banning of your right to protest and question these measure. </p>
<p>And as someone outdoorsy I travel further when I can, because I have no mountains, forests and the like within a 5km radius. I just have to take small roads to avoid checkpoints and fines. It's fucking bullshit.</p>

        <p>Travel restrictions in my mind are the most blatant rights violation and the least discussed in these subs. They seem tolerated yet in reality even in the most open places, we are actually just prisoners. I am in the US and have no travel restriction where I am yet I cannot maybe ever go to Canada and some states have pretty nasty restrictions. This is my hill to die on too.</p>

        <p>I get fined if I get stopped more than 5km from my house without a justifiable reason, and they literally have a list of what constitutes justifiable reasons. It was down to 2km for much of the first lockdown, and they are talking about bringing it down to 2km again. It's insane. There's no way I can be outdoors, get some sunlight, do exercise and stay healthy without breaking actual laws and risking fines. I agree that this is completely insane. </p>
<p>How the fuck are we supposed to stay healthy and positive if we can't go outside? Why can't we go to the parks, forests and mountains that are empty even on the best of days to clear our minds? And god forbid you get sick from sitting indoors for a year, because you can't see a GP or get in to a hospital unless you are dying this very minute or have Covid. This will cause so many long term consequences.</p>

<p>I’m feeling a bit of a Morpheus quote coming on here. Until these people are unplugged from the matrix, they are our enemy too. Every one of them. </p>
<p>People ratting on their neighbors. Getting their coworker fired. Calling for their arrest or business being closed. Until these people wake up, they are our mortal enemy.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I have been saying "I hate people" every single day of my life because of Covid. Yesterday, I was filling up my name and phone number in a notebook provided by the store to comply with "contact tracing". The staffs argued with me saying the way I was writing is way too curvy and unclear and demanded me to rewrite my information or else authorities might fined me a thousand buck. Seriously? ITS MY HANDWRITING FOR GODSAKE, FUCK PEOPLE.</p>

        <p>Exactly! The staffs were afraid that the police will come around to check everyone's information to be precise and accurate or you will be fined for it. To be honest, I've never seen anyone getting fined during covid except for rumours and news media.</p>

        <p>I'm getting to this point as well. What really disturbs me now are people actually getting all worked up and demanding  that people be punished for not wearing a mask <em>outdoors.</em> There are those now who seriously lose it over people who don't wear a mask even though they are outside just going for a walk in a very open, and uncrowded area. Fuck off if you think that I'm going to wear a mask when I go for a walk in the woods where hardly anybody else is. And no, I'm not going to feel the slightest bit "guilty" about driving a few hours in my own car to go an visit friends/family.</p>

        <p>I can't trust people in general anymore. To me they've all become images, shells. It feels like I've been betrayed, tricked. People who I thought seriously carer about making a better world - covid has revealed to me that it was all fake. It was just the bandwagon. They were just making themselves look good, it was all just virtue signalling. People care about their fear more than their friends. They won't think. I often wonder if they can.</p>

        <p>I already hated most people too. But on the plus side this whole thing makes it easier for me to know who I don't want to have anything to do with. If someone wears a mask outside with no one around or in their car I know to avoid them.</p>

<p>I hate sports. I've tried watching different sports as a "hobby". It's just boring. I'd literally rather watch grass grow...</p>
<p>Over the years, I've wondered what it would take for people to wake up and realize how their personal and financial freedoms are being constantly abused by their governments. When will a "resistance" begin? About 10 years ago, I confidently predicted that once a crisis was created (a plandemic in this case) that was "serious" enough to take away their precious sporting events, men would rise up and revolt enough to effect real change. </p>
<p>As we all know, most major sporting events were cancelled early last year. I thought, "Hell yeah! This is it. The awakening has begun. American men will not stand for this, and they'll protest enough for this whole fraud to come crashing down!"</p>
<p>For days, weeks, I waited. I waited some more. Nothing but the sound of crickets...</p>
<p>I can't describe how disappointed I've been with people since this. I just don't know what it'll take to wake people up.</p>

        <p>I’m the same way now. I’ll never forget those who are complicit with this. All these tyrant politicians and the people who voted for them. And that goes for friends and family too. I will never forgive them or forget.   </p>
<p>And if they all died of covid tomorrow I wouldn’t shed a single tear. I wouldn’t even pretend to notice or care.</p>

        <p>I can relate as well. I was already a low level misanthropist before this, but now it’s cranked way up to 100. I honestly do not care about the lives of lockdown supporters now, they may as well be dead to me.</p>

        <p>You think wearing your mask crooked is some kind of act of rebellion? I know people just like you. You think you're at the center of the universe and everyone else exists as stage props for your dramatic monologue. </p>
<p>You likely never matured emotionally after 16. You call people sheeple while blindly following your emotions and childish impulses regardless of reality and consequences. </p>
<p>I get that you just want to be the dark brooding hero in your dystopic YA fiction novel but the truth is you're just not special. Nobody cares if you've lost your faith in humanity or that you don't give a fuck if they die. That's your problem. Most mature and healthy members of society don't focus all their emotional energy into angst and a hatred for the human species. </p>
<p>The fact that you feel this way shows you're approaching your whole worldview and how you fit into it the wrong way. It would be better for you if you could just get over yourself.</p>

        <p>And my point is that that's a very ego-fueled myopic worldview. Society persists whether or not you give a fuck. And like it or not you are intrinsically part of society. </p>
<p>I took the time to say this because your words remind me of people that I have in my life that feel the same way. You're putting the people in your life-like your husband- through unnecessary hardship. </p>
<p>The only meaningful way that we exist is through other people. No one knows your inner thoughts They only know how you've impacted their lives and how you contributed to their world. </p>
<p>I don't mean to cause you any distress. I'm just trying to be brutally honest because I believe that that would be the best way to reach me if I were in your shoes. Even if you don't give a fuck about society, society still gives a fuck about you.</p>

        <p>I try to remember that for a lot of people the lockdowns were the first time realizing they don't live in a free world. </p>
<p>For people like me, I always thought something like this was bound to happen, and I never had any delusions that I was truly free or that my rights as an individual were truly respected. I already went through that grieving process years ago, and realized hatred can only add more fuel to the fire.</p>

        <p>You're right. It really isn't, but I don't think feeling that way is unjustified. There are some people who will never listen, but others will if you approach kindly and discuss. We have to try to break the stereotype of uneducated, aggressive, hateful, mass murdering psychopaths. If people see how wrong that is they may be more willing to listen.</p>
