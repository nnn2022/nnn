    <strong>How long will we ride this wave our?</strong>
    <p><p>Mardi Gras.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All bars: closed.</p>
<p>All to go drinks: banned.</p>
<p>Parades: canceled.</p>
<p>Celebrators: masked.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My love is like a powder keg.  In the corner of an empty warehouse just outside of town; about to burn down.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I volunteered for a shift tonight.  The guy that was supposed to have it having worked one day and deciding this was not the place for him.  My co workers talked him down and berated him but I understood.  My own background check took six weeks to come back and his took nine and half.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Not a good start to a new job.  No matter which direction you look at it from.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Five four three two one watch for the flash.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Something here will eventually have to explode.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The warning signs have all been too bright and garish, far too great in number to ignore to ignore.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>He waited nine and a half weeks to start work and his first shift was all propaganda.  All training modules about diversity and company history.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Everybody’s going to need a witness.  Everybody’s going to need a little backup in case the scene gets nasty.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Eight hours seems like a standard thing.  A hundred years ago it was decided that that is what we needed.  Eight hours of work.  Eight hours of sleep.   Eight hours of time to grow and learn.  Twenty four hours in a day.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If I see sunlight hit you I am sure that we’ll both decompose. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My profession is artistry.  Making spaces for them.  Being one of them.  Drinking with them.  PB: an artist turned food vendor drinks shots of jack daniels between making chili dogs and tacos that are worth it for pure charisma.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Bad luck comes in from Tampa on the back of a truck.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tonight I rang up an old man I was never meant to meet.  In a city I was never meant to be in.  Halfway through the transaction he steps back three feet and informs me:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>“If you don’t cover your nose I can’t do business with you.”</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As I asked him if he had his customer card my mask had slipped down to the tip of my nose.  Every loss I had had experienced flooded to me in that moment.  It was mardi gras day.  I should have had a full day of working for artists followed by my roommates putting on silly costumes and going out and being drunk and appropriately foolish.  One made her costuems fresh each year the other consistently in a pikachu onesie, nude underneath and belligerent if you asked what she was wearing inside it.  Me: playing video games on discord, drunk on whatever.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You can do whatever you want on mardi gras.  I want to play stellaris drunk and complain about not understanding what is happening.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tonight I was confronted by an old man who demanded I fix my mask I don’t want to be wearing in the first place.  It is a symbol of everything I have lost and might never regain.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I asked him if he had his customer loyalty card, for the second time, in a voice twice as loud as my muscles tensed.  I was a cashier ringing up some random person for some nonsense.  I was a blacksmith who had pounded out bracelets and knives and spear and arrow heads.  I was an artist who had consumed gallons of alcohol and shared stories with innumerable people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I hoped if I found the strength to walk out you’d stay the hell out of my way.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>He paid me and left.  I threw what I could against what I could.  I flexed my muscles, I ran through thoughts, I imagined scenarios.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Four hours later I was done with my shift.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I walked through the snow to a gas station and bought a pint of vodka.  Then wandered along the woods until I found a bench and sat.  I listen to music and drank as snow fell onto my clothes and soaked in.  Ice melted into my pants and black wool coat as snow fell down onto me.  I listened to music and watched the small trees sway in the wind.  I thought about how if I had a heart attack right now and was found that it would be just fine and that it would probably be labeled a covid death anyway.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am unhappy and no one cares but everyone cares if I don't care they are unhappy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>From the housetops to the gutters.  From the ocean to the shore.  The warning signs have all been bright and garish.  Far too great in number to ignore.</p></p>
