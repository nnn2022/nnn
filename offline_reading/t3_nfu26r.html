    <strong>This was just a test.</strong>
    <p><p>It was just a test of how obedient we will be and since majority of people acted and still act like a good little doggies (aka they passed the test), they will unleash the true hell around the autumn, right after we enjoy the little summer freedom they slowly giving us back. Mark my words. We haven't seen anything yet.</p></p>

        <p>I've been vegetarian for over half my life (I am 30 now) and have never even had food poisoning. You just need to wash your fruit and veggies well. If your alimentary canal biome is healthy, E coli etc can be dealt with without causing anything more than one (or two) visits to the loo.</p>

        <p>Yeah my concern there was overstated for sure. I was just referring to the occasional recalls of certain vegetables and the horror of a job that the workers have to go through.  Prison labor, etc. Ugh.</p>
<p>But to your point, I went vegetarian for 2 years --- (healthy vegetarian, not fat-guy-pizza-eater vegetarian) and it was the healthiest period of my life. I was invincible. A horrible sickness went around in the office and it skipped me. And my weight was never a concern, I could just eat however much I wanted.</p>

        <p>The masks worked really well.</p>
<p>Instead of blaming politicians and the corporations that benefit from our suffering -- people blamed the "anti maskers."</p>
<p>That was the entire point of the mask. To create a nation of scapegoats to take the blame for what the politicians and corporations did to us.</p>

        <p>On a similar note, my wife and I were just talking today about how some of what was pushed was so incredibly absurd that it was like they were deliberately sending out mixed messages.</p>
<p>One thing we noticed all along were videos of famous people getting the vaccine where somehow the camera was always angled just perfectly to where you couldn't see the needle going in.</p>
<p>So we looked back in time at older videos showing people getting vaccines and in older videos they were always very clear.</p>
<p>We also noticed videos where the needle seemed very clearly to move or change angle while the needle was supposedly in. You can't really do that with a needle!</p>
<p>It's all very fishy and something's not quite right.</p>
<p>It's not about our health -- god knows they love profitable industries that parasite off of our sicknesses...</p>
<p>But if it's just about money, then why use vaccines with strong side effects?</p>
<p>Also -- with the extreme push and coercion... A RAND Corporation thinktank document revealed that they know, very well, what's called "the boomerang effect."</p>
<p>The boomerang effect is the natural response of when you push something too hard, people tend to pull back in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>So... If they know coercion isn't as effective as making it available and encouraging it, why the extremism?</p>
<p>Also, things are starting to open up but a lot of investment went into those vaccine passports. I don't think this stuff is over...</p>
<p>Also, there's an economic crisis bubbling up again. Same as 2007 which led to the the Financial Crisis of 2008. Same as 2019 which led to these current events. And it's happening now.  Repo market Fed intervention has crept up to 294 billion now! It's been ramping up daily now for a few weeks. Somethings going on.</p>
<p>Such activity often acts as a forewarning for something that will come later... So with that in mind I have my eyes out for 3-5 months from now.</p>

        <p>I think the vaccines may be part of some sterilization program... about them not using the "Boomerang effect," I think they realized that some of the population was eating this up so much, they didn't even have to. Sadly.</p>

        <p>Can't you imagine them behind the scenes going, "Wow. They'll believe anything!" I'm not an Ayn Rand fan, really, but in The Fountainhead she had that theme in there a lot... Insiders pulling the wool over the public's eyes to an absurd degree.</p>
<p>In that book, this inside group had a poet in it and they all knew he was terrible. Just... the worst. So they published his book and wrote positive reviews about it, going on about how his poetry was revolutionary and sure enough, the public took his garbage writing and thought he was brilliant.</p>
<p>Similar.</p>
<p>Anyhow -- with the depopulation stuff... People think that's "conspiracy theory" but those people haven't read all 123 pages of Henry Kissinger's document:</p>
<p>National Security Memorandum #200, Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>Written in 1975, Declassified in 1989.</p>
<p>It's a dull read, but there are gems in there which make you realize --- it's real. And it's been going on for some time. The document goes into allocating funds for covert education programs to encourage the public on the benefits of not having children, etc.</p>
<p>Consequently we see this in movie, in all media, everywhere.  And it works. No one I work with has children. (!)</p>
<p>I have four though! I get trolled and followed around on here by nutjobs calling me an "ecoterrorist" for that sometimes. Stable &amp; balanced, these people. lol /s</p>

        <p>I haven't read that particular document but I've read a lot of stuff on depop, and I've heard Bill Gates saying things about it, too. I might actually have to read Rand at some point, too. I'm somewhat familiar with her work through others, but I have yet to read one of her books. She's been quoted a lot by a friend of mine throughout this pandemic.</p>

        <p>There is strange activity happening right now with the Fed intervention in the repo markets. This happened in 2007 prior to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>It happened in September 2019.</p>
<p>And it's happening now, bigtime. 243 billion in the most recent reverse-repo operation and it has been ramping up for several weeks now.</p>
<p>If my guess is correct, this forewarns of some major crisis 4-6 months from now.  That's getting close to the beginning of the next flu season.</p>
<p>Remember, there was a population explosion 80 years ago. We call them "baby boomers" but it was global.</p>
<p>Life expectancy is \~79. This population explosion went on for 20-25 years. I'm talking growth in the US jumping from 750k/year to over 3 million a year. Significant, rapid population growth.</p>
<p>Those people will be dying. The powers that be know this and will be using it to scare us with more stories of "most deaths ever." These deaths will increase year after year for the next decade at least.</p>
<p>And that doesn't include the additional deaths they caused by the incredibly unhealthy lockdown lifestyle and also the vaccines.</p>
<p>There's something REALLY creepy about the vaccines. We all know they don't care about saving lives -- that's silly. Only someone incredibly naive would believe that... So the assumption is money, right?</p>
<p>Except... If it was about money, why would they use vaccines that are at least 5-10 times more likely to cause death than typical vaccines...? And also --- the very strange menstrual cycles and breast issues that many women have had. Also reports of erectile dysfunction in some males? All very strange.</p>
<p>But it's also strange that the media didn't hide this from us. </p>
<p>And have you actually watched Event 201? You have to actually watch or at least listen to it. I know you know about it, but actually watch all 4 segments. When you actually watch it --- you realize the enormity of the fact they're doing this right out in the open.</p>
<p>It's one thing to talk about, but another to "get it." Watch it. Watch to the 4th segment when the whole last part is about controlling the flow of information. The "flood" technique. Silencing dissent, and altering social media algorithms to silence "misinformation."</p>
<p>This was all in October 2019. One month after the Fed's repo market intervention. Two months after Blackrock gave its recommendations to the Fed which all came to fruition.</p>
<p>And do you know about the WEF pandemic bonds?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/06/28/world-bank-launches-first-ever-pandemic-bonds-to-support-500-million-pandemic-emergency-financing-facility">https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/06/28/world-bank-launches-first-ever-pandemic-bonds-to-support-500-million-pandemic-emergency-financing-facility</a></p>
<p>They scammed investors out of 500 million (or more -- apparently it was oversubscribed by 200%)... They lured people in with promises of a guaranteed 11% return and then kept the money.</p>
<p>I suspect this money was used to manipulate political leaders worldwide. They knew. This was all planned.</p>
<p>This link is good for people just waking up to what's happening: https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/22/the-old-lady-who-swallowed-a-fly/</p>
<p>This one gets really deep into the details:</p>
<p><a href="https://goingdirect.solari.com/the-going-direct-reset/">https://goingdirect.solari.com/the-going-direct-reset/</a></p>
<p>I'm really worried about what happens before the end of the year. I really hope we're all wrong.</p>

        <p>Frankly, at this point it could be anything and a combination of many things. I think there is little doubt that transforming society into a society 2.0 (read: the great reset) is at the center of it all but recently another thought has been bugging me:</p>
<p>What if we have entered a new era of warfare, in which large scale biological warfare is a real possibility and governments need to ensure that their whole population gets regularly injected multiple times a year with rapidly developed vaccines to adapt to threads without the population even noticing what’s going on? Kind of the biological version of the nuclear arms race in the Cold War.</p>
<p>Just a wild theory but it seems like anything goes these days...</p>
