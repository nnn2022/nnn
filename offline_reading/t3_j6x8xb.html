    <strong>Just took a walk and passed by someone wearing a surgical mask while mowing his lawn</strong>
    <p><p>I fucking hate everybody.  How can anybody with a brain operating at a level higher than comatose possibly think wearing a mask when outdoors on your own lawn, with no other people anywhere in sight aside from one pedestrian on the other side of the road, actually accomplishes anything?  Talk about a goddamn clown world.</p></p>

        <p>Went on a trail today. Spotted about 6 chin-diapers on the ground. Pretty disgusting, but also people probably got fed up at some point.</p>

        <p>That's fucking gross and inexcusable tbh.  I'm all for saying "fuck this useless bullshit" and ripping off your mask mid-hike, but they should have at least shoved it in their pocket and thrown it out later.  Take out everything you take in should be the rule of thumb for trails and nature preserves.</p>
<p>EDIT: but it only further proves that the mask crowd are just virtue signaling losers who only do "good" things if social media tells them to.  Remember when #trashtag was all the rage?  Would they have thrown their masks on the ground when it was still #trashtag season?  But now littering is a-ok as long as you're wearing your dirty washcloth over your mouth while you litter.</p>

        <p>Most hikers are hipsters and hipsters love to talk about caring for the environment I've seen many of them destroy these same trails that they claim to be so in love with. They seem to obsessed with claiming to be about something but then in actuality not doing anything about it. In other words HYPOCRITES. That's why I don't associate with those bums anymore.</p>

        <p>Our trails here in the NYC exurbs are inundated every weekend and all summer long with Manhattanites who are "escaping the city" (yeah, you love your city so damn much you jump on every opportunity you get to leave it... 🙄).  And it's gotten exponentially worse since lockdowns started.</p>
<p>They preach about being treehuggers, loving "the environment", feeling connected to nature, etc... yet they take road trips or diesel train trips to get up here week after week, leave a goddamn mess behind, feed wildlife every opportunity they get (they've spoiled the ducks and geese who live along the Hudson River so bad that they could probably not even survive without humans to feed them any more), and generally make asses of themselves because they view this whole region as their personal playground</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they accuse the people who <em>actually live here</em>, love the open land we live among, curate the land, and pick up after their slob asses, of "destroying the planet" and "not caring about the environment", because apparently we're all Trump supporters and we all want him to dissolve the EPA or something.  Also a lot of us drive pickup trucks and that's "bad for the environment".  I've also seen a lot of hate for burning wood for heat, though admittedly I've never heard this complaint in person, it definitely seems to be more of a reddit/fb platitude</p>
<p>I live on a lake and I recently joined the facebook group for lake residents.  Like 80% of the discussion in the group is about cleaning up the lake, how we can keep the water as healthy as possible, both for human swimmers and for the water fowl, fish, and other wildlife that we share the area with.  People know all about which weed/aquatic plant species are natural and which are invasive, there's a post going around now asking everyone to keep their eye out for an injured hawk, stuff like that.  And yes, that includes the ones who fly Trump flags on their boats.</p>
<p>I'm generally pretty tolerant and accepting of people from all walks of life, but there's a specific brand of city folks that just rub me the wrong way.  They see "the country" as a vacation destination that exists solely for their entertainment, and as such, they treat the people who live out here as caricatures if not servants.  It's incredibly arrogant.</p>

        <p>Oddly enough this is exactly my own experience with many years of internet arguments.  I'm far from a cowboy myself (more of a cellardwelling grocery store cashier from a really dumpy suburb), but there is a certain type of city person that just makes me want to punch the screen when I read their posts.</p>
<p>The mentality of the arrogant, condescending urban sophisticate absolutely does lend itself to believing and spreading the Branch Covidian narrative.</p>

        <p>I agree. I’m along the Delaware, so a little further up but it’s the same here. The condescension is staggering. I used to work in a library and they spoke to me like I was a special needs child. The lecturing of farmers and residents about how to be better is incredible, including the absolute vitriol they reserve for those they disagree with. They come to escape the dystopian shithole the city has become, while trying to implement the same policies here. So sick of it!</p>

<p>It seems like they want to bring the commercial development and population density with them too.  I'm fortunate to live in a town that has some pretty big chunks of land that are untouchable State Park territory, and a town supervisor/government that  aggressively oppose development.  But most of the surrounding towns have been overrun with disgusting gaudy McCondo complexes and strip malls and the traffic has become unbearable.  Fuck you, if you wanted to live in a crowded, overdeveloped, traffic-jam suburb, that's what Westchester and NJ are for.</p>

        <p>Totally get this. Yeah the whole mentality in nyc where those with means escape to somewhere else whenever they can is hilarious and annoying. Not only is it a clear show of privilege that that type always rants about in other situations, it’s also just crazy that all these people live (and claim to love) living somewhere that they are always trying to get away from. People who live in NYC, particularly manhattan, are never home-they’re out at shows and restaurants and bars and stuff. I mean I get it in the sense of their places are tiny and likely filled with roommates. I guess I’m different but even though I enjoy travel and doing things, I want to live in something I enjoy being in.</p>

        <p>My city is doing an audit of the recycle carts. I can't help but notice that all the people with Biden signs and the virtue signaling "In this house we believe" etc  signs that would debate be on climate issues... Are the ones that had the nastygram tags on their carts that the city didn't pick up because they were breaking all the rules (which contaminate recycling) and mine was picked up without issue. The ones nextdoor to me with the acab sign have a shit ton of litter around their house which has even made it into my fenced yard. I can't with the hypocrites. And, I'm one of only a few houses that pays for curbside commercial compost. So, they can say they care about the environment but I only put out my 32 gal trash cart (tiny) once every 6-8 weeks and I recycle properly and compost, so I'm pretty sure I'm actually being more effective than their lazy asses.</p>

        <p>There are some people who have to wear them for work, and their work requires them to drive to different locations. So it makes sense for them to just leave the mask on while driving instead of wasting time taking it off and putting it back on several times.</p>

        <p>What do you mean? I didn’t refer to a specific mask. The example I’m thinking of is my mother, who has to wear a medical grade mask because the works with disabled people, and she has to drive to multiple locations throughout her day. And it takes a moment to properly fit these masks to your face, so it’s not “a fraction of a second.”</p>

        <p>Personally, It doesn't bother me if others want to wear masks.... but yet, it also does.  Not for the same reasons expressed by many, here.</p>
<p>When masked people talk to me, the mask hides a whole other level of expressions that we normally use to communicate with eachother.  The eyes aren't the only way we communicate.  For example,  if someone looks at me when they walk by, there's no way for me to tell what their intent is beyond that.... are they smiling behind that mask? Are they grimacing?  Who can say?</p>
<p>Most people avoid any conversation at all now when out shopping.  I live in a southern town,  where strangers are generally friendly and greet one another. Since the implementation of masks, this has almost completely ceased.  Nobody talks.   Nobody smiles (as far as anyone can tell).  All you see are pairs of floating eyeballs, void of personality, soul, enthusiasm.  I no longer recognize anyone I might know.  Our freedom is gone, and our humanity is going with it.  Is this the world we want?  Is this what you want for your children?  Not me.</p>
<p>You can see how this is already affecting people, though.  Women here don't dress up the way they used to.  They don't do their hair or makeup.  They step out in what appears to be the same clothes they've been wearing for the past week.  Guys are not that much better. </p>
<p>What happens if this "new normal" continues?  How will people date?  How will people socialize if they can't get within 6 feet of eachother?  </p>
<p>Those maskers that virtue signal or wear it as a sign of cooperation perhaps don't realize that they're really saying they agree with ditching the last of their freedoms, and yours as well.  We live in a world now where the truth is a lie, and the lie is the truth, and people forget that the maskless individual is fighting back hard for the last of your freedoms. </p>
<p>I don't so much judge maskers, as much as I do pity them.  They don't realize that they are voluntarily relinquishing their freedom in the guise of virtue.  This is a terrible trick being played on humanity.</p>

<p>You cant know what others are thinking with or without the mask anyway. Thinking you can is dangerous. Never assume a strangers intent.</p>
<p>&rt;Our freedom is gone, and our humanity is going with it. Is this the world we want? Is this what you want for your children?</p>
<p>Our freedom isnt gone. I want my children to be healthy and have a relationship with their healthy elders.</p>

<p>If mask wearing and social distancing is adhered to, those activities will return sooner. It's one marshmallow now vs 2 later. Take the long view.</p>

        <p>Personally I like to see smiling faces and I have a hard time communicating with masks. They also promote an atmosphere of paranoia and fear which I think is harmful to our general well-being. So while I can't say that another person wearing a mask is "hurting me" I do think that it's objectively negative and, in some ways, unacceptable.</p>

<p>They do interfere with communication</p>
<p>&rt;They also promote an atmosphere of paranoia and fear which I think is harmful to our general well-being.</p>
<p>The virus does that, not masks. When I put on my mask, it helps alleviate some of the pandemic anxiety. Its something I can do to protect myself and others.</p>
<p>You could reframe it in your mind, instead of "people wearing masks are damaging societies mental health" you might think "people wearing masks are combatting the spread of disease, which will accelerate societies return to normal function".</p>

        <p>Awesome! I love when people post this paper. This systematic review is largely concerned with the protective effect of masks, rather than the preventative effect. That is, do masks help protect me from getting sick? For whatever reason, before COVID-19, people weren't particularly interested in finding out whether or not masks help to protect others. Fortunately for us the paper doesn't ignore the issue of source control entirely, and in fact includes a handful of studies on the topic in it's analysis and conclusion. (Although I hesitate to call them studies, one consisted of less than 10 people coughing onto a petri dish, another was terminated early.) Now I'm reluctant to include the relevant text because I'm worried you may not read it, seeing as you apparently didn't read the whole paper in the first place, but the authors do a good job of laying out the details and I don't feel like summarizing it myself, so I'm just going to paste a paragraph straight from your link. </p>
<p>"There were five randomised controlled trials identified of masks used by sick patients (Johnson et al., 2009, Barasheed et al., 2014, Leung et al., 2020, MacIntyre et al., 2016, Canini et al., 2010). One was an experimental study of 9 influenza patients, which did not measure clinical endpoints (Johnson et al., 2009). Participants with confirmed influenza coughed onto culture medium wearing a N95 respirator or a mask. No influenza grew on the medium. A trial of 105 sick patients wearing a mask (or no mask) in the household found no significant difference between arms (Canini et al., 2010). However, the trial was terminated prematurely and did not meet recruitment targets, so was probably underpowered. One randomised controlled trial was conducted among Hajj pilgrims, with both well and sick pilgrims wearing masks, and low rates of ILI were reported among contact of mask pilgrims (Barasheed et al., 2014). Our randomised controlled trial is the largest available with clinical endpoints, and studied 245 patients randomised to mask or control (MacIntyre et al., 2016). Compliance was suboptimal in the mask group and some controls wore masks. The intention to treat analysis showed no difference, but when analysed by actual mask use, the rate of infection in household contacts was lower in those who wore masks (MacIntyre et al., 2016). A trial with an experimental design was published in April 2020, examining a range of viruses including seasonal human coronaviruses (Leung et al., 2020). This showed that coronaviruses are preferentially found in aerosolized particles compared to large droplets, and could be expelled by normal tidal breathing. Wearing a surgical mask prevented virus from being exhaled." </p>
<p>Note that none of these studies are examining the use of cloth face coverings or bandanas, but instead medical grade masks. Likewise they are only masking sick people, rather than the general population. In fact all the existing research is examining the issue at a micro level, asking, "will I prevent this someone from getting sick if I wear a mask?" When we should be asking, "will the overall number of illnesses decrease if everyone wears a mask?" But I digress...</p>
<p>Hopefully it's clear that out of those 5 studies, the best possible evidence comes from MacIntyre et al. 2016. A cluster RCT which specifically studied medical grade masks and concluded: "rates of clinical respiratory illness (relative risk (RR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.13), ILI (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.13) and laboratory-confirmed viral infections (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.54) were consistently lower in the mask arm compared with control, although not statistically significant. A post hoc comparison between the mask versus no-mask groups showed a protective effect against clinical respiratory illness, but not against ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections." </p>
<p>So according to objective statistical analysis, they found no effect. After the fact, they went back to reanalyze the data and came up with a different conclusion. Oh yeah, did you also notice that MacIntyre herself is the author of the systematic review in the first place? Bias much? </p>
<p>A government mandate that infringes on my rights and impacts my daily life in such a negative way must be supported by the highest standard of evidence. So far, I have not seen any evidence to support a sweeping mandate requiring healthy members of the public to wear cloth masks in non-healthcare settings. Let me know if you find any.</p>

        <p>Oh boy, lots to work with here. I'm looking for scientific evidence that says forcing outwardly healthy people to wear cloth face coverings will lower the total number of illnesses, so I'll just go one by one to see if any of these links contain such evidence. </p>
<ol>
<li>A government recommendation, not scientific evidence for the effectiveness of masks.</li>
<li>Another recommendation, rather than scientific evidence, but this one comes with citations. Here's a direct quote from this document: "At present, there is no direct evidence (from studies on COVID19 and in healthy people in the community) on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19."</li>
<li>Another government recommendation, not scientific evidence. This page references "emerging evidence" for the efficacy of face masks. I will not go into their sources here, in favor of looking through the material you provided.</li>
<li>Referring to N95 respirators and surgical masks, not cloth masks and bandanas. </li>
<li>This paper does not go into the scientific evidence supporting masks, instead invoking the precautionary principle to propose that we wear masks <em>even if they don't work</em>, because there's a small chance that they might. </li>
<li>This paper is analyzing the effectiveness of masks as protective equipment for the wearer, not their efficacy in preventing transmission. Nonetheless I will include some relevant quotes: "Very little good quality research exists on the use of cloth masks, especially in non-medical settings." Here's another: "Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said, “There is only very limited evidence of the benefits of wearing face masks by the general public, no evidence that wearing them in crowded places helps at all, and no evidence at all yet related to covid-19 . . . The authors also acknowledge that mass face mask wearing by the public would likely cause shortages among people who genuinely need protective equipment—healthcare workers on the front line in our hospitals.” "</li>
<li>This is an observational study assessing all non-pharmaceutical interventions taken in Hong Kong to suppress the COVID-19 during the initial phase of the pandemic. They conclude that NPIs did indeed have an effect on disease transmission, but being an observational study we can't draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of any single measure, least of all masks. </li>
<li>This is a FAQ about mask shortages in hospitals. Not sure why it is included. </li>
<li>This is a meta-analysis which, again, is concerned with the protective effect of face masks, rather than the preventative effect. Here's their conclusion: " Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 to −10·7; <strong><em>low certainty</em></strong>), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar..." </li>
<li>This article does not go into the scientific evidence for cloth masks on the general public, instead advocating for better education in regards to best hygiene and mask-wearing practices. For the record, this is something I agree with, and I fully acknowledge that one of the main reason masks are so ineffective for the general public is improper use.</li>
<li>FINALLY! 10 absolutely garbage pieces and then this! Now this is what I was looking for! Solid scientific evidence that shows states had a reduction in transmission following mask mandates. Great stuff. I have concerns about the fact that they selected only 15 states for analysis, and that the study period was less than a month long, but yes, this is what I was looking for. Take note of how this study <em>actually answers</em> the relevant research question, which is: "Does forcing outwardly healthy people to wear cloth face coverings lower the total number of illnesses?" This study suggests that yes, it does. </li>
<li>This is not a scientific publication, so I'm not quite sure what I'm reading here. In any case, the author says that mask wearing as source control is supported by "indirect evidence" and cites the CDC and WHO links you provided, so I won't go into those again. </li>
<li>Again, not scientific evidence, just government recommendations. I thought this was funny though: "Given that infected people without symptoms can transmit the virus, it is also prudent to encourage the use of fabric face masks in public places where there is community transmission and where other prevention measures, such as physical distancing, are not possible.(12) " Guess what citation #12 is? That's right, it's the same memo you included up above which, in case you forgot, says, "At present, there is no direct evidence (from studies on COVID19 and in healthy people in the community) on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19."</li>
<li>This is not scientific evidence, just more recommendations. This website cites the CDC links you posted. More circular references. </li>
</ol>
<p>Nice! 1/14 ain't bad at all. That particular study is interesting, I'm excited to look into it some more. I hope they extend their research to include more states and look at the pandemic on a longer time scale, then their results would be really convincing. As I said before, a government mandate which affects my daily life to this extent must be supported by the highest possible standard of evidence. So far, I have yet to see that evidence. You gave me one study here, but that is far from a consensus, and still no one has done any significant research into the potential harms like reduced communication and impacts on mental health. Regardless, I've been partially swayed, and I'm perfectly willing to change my tune if more studies come out with similar conclusions. Until then, still waiting.</p>

        <p>Seriously? You're just gonna throw links at me? Are you even reading my comments? I thought we could have a discussion here. Any chimp can use the copy and paste feature, watch: <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</a> </p>
<p>That's from Oxford University's Center for Evidence Based Medicine. It's titled, Masking Lack of Evidence with Politics, and I do hope you'll take the time to read it. </p>
<p>Look, your article was somewhat compelling but it was hardly anything new. I'm aware that many experts recommend mask usage, but many others do not, like the author of the article I posted above. This sentence and the citation got my attention, "A preprint study<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02801-8#ref-CR4">4</a> posted in early August (and not yet peer reviewed), found that weekly increases in per-capita mortality were four times lower in places where masks were the norm or recommended by the government, compared with other regions. Researchers looked at 200 countries, including Mongolia, which adopted mask use in January and, as of May, had recorded no deaths related to COVID-19." But it turned out to be the only true scientific evidence referenced in the whole thing, besides the study by Lyu &amp; Wehby which we already discussed. The author goes on to state, specifically referring to these two studies, "But such studies do rely on assumptions that mask mandates are being enforced and that people are wearing them correctly. Furthermore, mask use often coincides with other changes, such as limits on gatherings." But still, it's something. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the experts interviewed for the piece said things like, "When it comes down to it, we still don’t know a lot." And, in context, "For now, Osterholm, in Minnesota, wears a mask. Yet he laments the “lack of scientific rigour” that has so far been brought to the topic. “We criticize people all the time in the science world for making statements without any data,” he says. “We’re doing a lot of the same thing here.” "</p>
<p>But you know what quote really gets me? And what I would really like to discuss with you, is this one: "There’s a lot more we would like to know, but given that it is such a simple, low-cost intervention with potentially such a large impact, who would not want to use it?"</p>
<p>There are two things that really stand out to me here. First, the words, "<em>potentially ... large impact.</em>" As I have said numerous times, a government mandate that intrudes so forcefully into my daily activities must be supported by the highest possible standard of evidence. To answer the leading question of the article, how much evidence is enough, I must say that "potential" impact does not cut it. Second, is the statement, "<em>such a simple, low-cost intervention</em>." How can you say that? How can you claim to know the short and long term effects of covering everyone's face in public? Low-cost? By what measurement? You seemed to brush off my concerns earlier, but they're legitimate concerns. I cannot communicate effectively through masks. You want me to just live with it? Some people are saying we need to wear masks forever now, to prevent the flu and the common cold. I don't want to live in that world. </p>
<p>And none of this, none of the research that you've referenced, none of the governmental info sites, none of the pop-sci articles, none of them seriously tackle the idea that masks only need to be used by sick people. If I'm not sick, and I have no reason to believe I could be sick, why do you want to force me to wear a mask? Seriously, I'm asking you personally, u/onecommentoneverysub why do <em>you</em> want to <em>force me</em> to cover my face in public? I'm perfectly healthy, transmission rates are low in my area, I take my temperature every morning and I get tested when I think I've been exposed. So why do you want me to cover my face? What are you getting out of it? Please, I hope you don't just reply with another link. I'm genuinely curious to know.</p>

<p>This is the right line of questioning. What do all these scientists and government organizations get out of this? What's in it for them? I do not feel as though my freedom has been impinged upon in the slightest by any of the protective measures imposed or recommended, but its clear that a vocal minority who do exist. I try to empathize with this view in an effort to understand it.</p>
<p>What do they stand to gain? How is this furthering their goals and what are those goals? Do you have any theories or evidence about an alternate agenda with covid precautions?</p>

        <p>Then why aren't you empathizing with me? You really don't feel that your freedom has been impinged upon in any way by <em>any</em> of the protective measures? Then I don't think we can possibly find common ground. You really feel as free today as you did on January 1st of this year? That does not compute. </p>
<p>Look, I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I don't think there's some New World Order behind the scenes cackling while we put on our muzzles. A lot of people around here do think things like that, so I understand why you might make that assumption. I just think that overzealous bureaucrats are being demanded to take extraordinary precautions by a fearful populous. No one wants to be the one that didn't do enough to stop the virus. People will call you a murderer regardless of the outcome, so you might as well take every possible action to make it look like you did as much as you could. Of course people recommend masks, they think it's the right thing to do, and no one would dare to do the "wrong" thing. The fact of the matter is, we are not 100% sure that it's the right thing. We're not even 50% sure. We need to be far more confident if we're going to take such drastic measures, because they are drastic, whether you choose to acknowledge the downsides or not. </p>
<p>Is it possible that some mega-corporations or hostile foreign entities are appropriating the issue because they stand to benefit from the dissolution of the common social fabric? Maybe, but that's not really what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned about setting a precedent that any protective measure is okay as long as there are a few studies touting its benefit. </p>
<p>So I ask you again, if I'm healthy, why do you want me to wear a mask? I don't get it. If I'm sick, sure, you want me to wear a mask because it may reduce my ability to infect others. But if I'm healthy? Why? What is the end goal?</p>

<p>I think I am closer to understanding now. There is a fundamental difference between how anti maskers and the rest of the us population evaluate personal liberty with respect to public health and safety. I've noticed that over and over again you use very direct phrasing to refer to the situation. Its "you want me to do x", not "why is it necessary for me to do x". Perceptions of personal freedom overwhelm the thought process. You arent one with society, and you perceive your welfare as being in someway separate from it. You place your self at the center of it.</p>
<p>The great majority of americans live in urban environments, and I think this plays a big role in the individualist vs community mindedness. When you are surrounded by masses of people you can observe very directly your role a context in the group..
I'm not making any moral judgement about this difference in perception, just observing how it may affect attitudes towards public health.</p>
<p>How would you solve the trolly problem?</p>

        <p>Yup, you got me. Just an uneducated individualist country boy with no regard for the greater good. This isn't anything like the trolley problem because if I'm healthy I literally <em>cannot</em> kill anyone.</p>
<p>Fine, let's take my individual self out of the equation. Why do you want to force healthy people to wear masks if they pose zero danger to society? Is it possible that you just want to feel like you're doing something? Is there a chance that this is your way of showing others that you're a good person, that you care about the collective, regardless of whether or not the mask does any good at all? This isn't the movie Contagion. You're not a hero. You're arguing on Reddit about what amounts to unsettled science. My issue is, why are we letting unsettled science dictate policy decisions? Especially decisions that affect every person in nearly all aspects of their daily lives? Why won't you answer this question?</p>
<p>"Perceptions of [virtue and collectivism] overwhelm the thought process. You aren't [a single human being, you're] one with society, and you perceive your welfare as being in some way [synonymous with] it. You place yourself [below] it."</p>

        <p>You're welcome, I just wish you would do the same. I still don't understand your line of reasoning, but I'm pretty sure if you would ever come right out and say it it might go something like this:</p>
<p>"I know the science is not settled, but I choose to believe cloth masks on the general public work to slow the spread of infectious diseases. However, even if they do not work I will support government mandates which force healthy people to wear them because I do not believe that doing so could be harmful to an individual or to society in any way." </p>
<p>Essentially, no harm no foul? Is that close?</p>

        <p>This is really good stuff! I particularly liked the following passage:</p>
<p>"The median opening date among states with [mask]-based reopening strategies was 40 days later than the median in the rest of states, June 10 compared to May 1, 2020. The [mask]-based group also had experienced greater cumulative COVID-19 burden of cases and deaths per capita on the date of reopening. Of the 38 states opening dining rooms prior to implementing a statewide mask mandate, only 21 implemented a statewide mask mandate as of August 31, on average 56 days following indoor restaurant reopening. The [mask]-based group was less likely to open bars, gyms, salons, religious facilities, retail stores, theaters, and to allow (?) non-essential medical procedures."</p>
<p>Seems like the issue is quite complex! You may notice I made some edits to that text. I took issue with the authors' choice to label a strategy as "evidence-based" if it included a mask mandate, and "not evidence-based" if it did not. It seems odd to me that they would use such language if the issue of the paper is to find the very evidence they refer to. It does not give me confidence as to their impartiality, but fortunately the data mostly speak for themselves. Keep it up!</p>

        <p>I'm going to play devils advocate here. I have really bad seasonal allergies, and in August/September when all the ragweed comes out I normally have a really rough time, especially when cutting grass. So I guess this could make sense if he has really bad allergies and is trying to avoid a day or two of a runny nose and sinus pressure. </p>

        <p>Yeah we have several acres in East Texas and I sometimes wear one when mowing while on the riding lawn mower. When I don't and I blow my nose there is tons of crap that comes out, grass clippings, dirt, dust, some black stuff. But I will say this I get a headache from time to time which also makes sense. I do not wear one shopping or driving though. It's idiotic IMO.</p>

        <p>I actually see a lot of folks here wearing masks while mowing before covid.  Maybe allergies but I always assumed it was for all the dirt/dust that gets kicked up and not breathing it in.  It can get very dry here so when you mow there's like clouds of dust getting kicked up.</p>

        <p>I wear a mask while riding my bike because my destination is usually somewhere that requires a mask, like a grocery store, and if I don’t wear it while riding then I have to stop and shuffle through my backpack to find it before going in, which is more difficult then just wearing it for the ride.</p>

        <p>This reminds me of a game I play with my wife and kids. If we see someone driving in a car by themselves with a mask on, the first one to tell “MASK!” gets the point. And then we just keep a tally as we go. The kids love it. So many people have gone so overboard with this blown out of proportion pandemic.</p>

        <p>Saw a man at the park yesterday playing with his two kids, who couldn’t have been over 5 years old, in a large patch of grass 50 yards from anyone else. Both the children were wearing masks. It made me really sad to see and I can’t help to wonder how it will affect children down the road in terms of their mental health and being so afraid of being outside or around people maskless</p>

        <p>They don't think that. What we need to realize is that masks are now fashionable. Most people wear one and most people will conform to the larger group. This isn't about the effectiveness of masks, that ship has sailed and we lost. Now we need to figure out how to normalize not wearing a mask again. And frankly I'm at a loss.</p>

        <p>I do this every single time I mow, even before the "plandemic", and I wear goggles, too.  Our grass is patchy  in some areas, kicking up huge amounts of dust, dirt, and debris. It gets in my eyes, mouth, nose, lungs.... everywhere.  All the mowers I see in our area do the same.  This has nothing to do with CV, in most cases.</p>

        <p>I am very anti mask.  Haven't worn one yet and plan not to.  That said, it is possible the guy feels the same way and was only wearing it to prevent grass dust from getting in his throat.  I've always worn one when mowing but it's only ever been to keep grass dust out of my mouth and throat.  The few times I haven't worn it while mowing I've had to stop mid mow and cough up a lung and drink a gallon of water to be able to breath past the mud I've built up in my throat.</p>
<p>The fact that it is only mostly effective, even for this task and that I can still smell the grass and the gasoline is evidence enough that it wouldn't be effective against a virus even if the virus was worth avoiding with such rigor.</p>

        <p>I live In a rural area that has taken in even more New Yorkers than normal. Parking lots and trails are littered with masks. I remember seeing people outside in their own yards with masks in the middle of summer. It really is bizzaro world out there.</p>

        <p>Lets not conflate illegal with against "the rules" during this time. Not wearing a mask or skating in a grocery store is against the rules but it's certainly not illegal. At worst, they can ban you or call the cops for trespassing.</p>

        <p>I see a lot of people here say they are doing that for different reasons, and again, it’s very unfortunate that something you’ve been doing for years or found now to work for you personally all of a sudden - centre of attention creating major opinion clashes. I am trying to remember that whatever people decide to do to themselves is non of my business and I was not invited to give my review, especially that I don’t know the backstory. But damn it’s hard to be reasonable when most who wear these masks are on the level of foil hat conspiracists and forcing it onto others along with other shit, saying “this is new normal, you better get used to it”. I just fucking start seeing red.</p>

        <p>It's the extremely toxic culture that this whole covid mass psychosis has created. The connotation around masks has been changed forever. Now you cannot see a mask without thinking: Covid mass psychosis. From the insane obsession with masks...to the uncovered human face is now seen as abnormal, subversive, dangerous. To the loads of  ignorance and misinformation surrounding this weak virus, to thinking it should be normal for everyone to wear them in all public settings forever, to jacking off to how intellectually and morally superior they are for loving masks. The Covidians have made it so that masks are forever associated with their sanctimonious virtue-signaling, pandemic LARPing, medieval quackery cult.</p>

        <p>Does anyone really wear a N-95/Surgical mask pre-COVID to cut their grass?  I get the people scared of dust. But I doubt they were buying “surgical masks” pre-covid for lawn work. </p>
<p>With that said, dust/dirt/ragweed are good for ya. Helps build immunity. You should be sensitive until your used to it. Then ya good. Mask ain’t gonna hurt ya, but if it’s not overly dusty, your body is made is handle dust/dirt particles  </p>
<p>If dude was hiding from “germs” while mowing in his surgical mask, I gotta say, he’s taking the programming WELL!! But, to me, I hate what it is, but he’s told to think that way and does exactly what he’s told.  Sad to see someone that can’t think for themselves....and worst of all, someone that can think for themselves is the devil to them. I can’t help but feel sorry for them while also assuming that they think I’m stupid. Ultimate catch 22. ..... that’s 2020 for ya tho.</p>

        <p>Earlier, even before mask mandates were introduced, I would see people with masks alone in their cars, when walking their dogs, pretty much everywhere. But now, it's rare to see someone wearing a mask outside, but most still do inside. I don't thibk this is necessarily people waking up though, in some parts of the country, we had temperatures of over 110°F(43°C). Wearing a mask in these hellish temperatures is just torture.</p>
