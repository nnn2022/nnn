    <strong>Coerced/forced inoculation - I could use some input and advice</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I could use some input on my current situation.  To give you a little background, I am 28 and my wife is 29.  We just had a little girl at the end of April.  My family runs a small, medical device company that is essentially a perpetual startup.  Since I was 15, I have wanted to be in medical device sales and specifically work for my dad.  I saw how successful he was and the flexibility he had running a business; I want to provide the same for my family.  After getting some experience after college, I joined the company and will have been here four years in September.  We have an agreement with a venture capitalist firm to distribute legitimate gamechanging product led by one of the most well known medtech VC's in the space.  I am leading sales and loving it.  Seriously living my dream job, making good money, and working for and with family.</p>
<p>Part of my job is leading surgeon trainings and attending first and sometimes second surgeries to make sure the surgery goes well.  I can't say enough how much I love this job; I get to help make an impact on people's lives and work with surgeons and high-class sales people to build our business.  You all can probably guess where this is headed, but many hospitals and hospital systems are starting to force their employees to get the jab.  This includes any and all vendors...whether it's someone in my positions or even contractors for HVAC, construction, etc.   I am not inoculated, nor do I plan to be...but there is a high probability that I may be forced to get the shot to keep my job.</p>
<p>My plan is to hold out as long as I can and hope that most hospitals are slow/do not force the covid-19 shot.  This is a product that will eventually be bought by a larger company very quickly once we get more surgeons using it and disrupt our competitors.  I have been against this covid-19 scam essentially since the beginning.  I have no desire to get inoculated.  That being said, this opportunity can legitimately create generational wealth for myself and my family.  Is it worth it to get jabbed and hope it's a nothingburger and continue to work my dream job and potentially give my family the financial flexibility to live an easier life?  Is it worth it to continually get boosters that I will be forced into? This job could help me tear away from The Machine, allow my wife to stay home, keep my daughter out of public schools, and allow me more time to spend with them.  Do I walk away, take a huge pay cut to find another sales job in a different industry, and hope that they don't enforce the jab? There are a lot of other things I am considering, and plenty more to my story that impacts my decision.  But I want to hear your thoughts, and specifically if you are in a similar situation with work or work in healthcare.  Or maybe if you have walked away from your job because of a similar situation.</p>
<p>One quote I keep coming back to from Mark Twain, "I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them have never happened."</p></p>

        <p>You should not have normalcy bias, at this point. Do not think that generational wealth will not be destroyed in what is to come, either way. If you take the shot, then you will lose everything. Not just yet but certainly by 2030. </p>
<p>Caring for your family means to decouple from a state that is murdering the very concept of what family is.</p>

        <p>Talk with a shrewd money manager that you'd trust with your life, and diversify that potential generational wealth. It's yours, make sure it stays that way, as well as making sure it stays in the family without gross taxes and fees and laws around it.</p>

        <p>Lie.</p>
<p>I'm not calling you a liar, I'm saying how I think you should approach the situation if it looks like it'll be mandatory. Just lie. But do it before the "you must" order so it doesn't look suspect. How will they know?</p>
