    <strong>Little wins. Giving permission for others to not be doomers.</strong>
    <p><p>Today was the first day of a class I'm attending in which it is important for the students to watch the instructor's hands carefully. The instructor was wearing rubber gloves because of Covid. I asked her before class started, "I wonder if those gloves might make it difficult for us to see your hand movements." She told me her friend said she should wear gloves in class for protection. But she said she agreed with me, and she took them off before the start of class. After she took them off, she said she felt much better. The gloves were making her hands feel hot and sticky. </p>
<p>So now the instructor doesn't have to wear annoying gloves during class, and I don't have to look at them!</p></p>

        <p>Seriously it sounds small but doing things like that makes a difference. Keep it up.</p>
