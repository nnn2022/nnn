    <strong>Isolation of SARS-CoV-2</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://nonewabnormal.com/isolation-of-sars-cov-2/">Here</a> is my post on the topic of isolation. It's quite a rabbit hole so I've surely not covered everything, but this is my best first draft at hitting all the important parts.</p>
<p>I've included archived links to the actual papers i could find that <em>claim</em> to have "isolated" it, and highlighted the snippets that appear to belie the claim.</p>
<p>Also included are archived links to Freedom of Information Act requests that people have sent to various government / public health bodies where they admit to no isolation. I also include links to the uncensorable video archive where there are videos of Dr. Sam Bailey, Dr. Thomas Cowan, Dr. Andrew Kaufman etc. I would like to find more high quality videos on the topic of isolation to add to that playlist.</p>
<p>I think the crux of the issue can be summed up like this: the claim of <em>isolating a virus</em> is two entirely different things in the minds of what people <em>assume</em> that means vs what the process they do actually does and means. I can't pretend to be an expert on that, but I feel like more transparency and true scientific scrutiny of the subject is warranted, given that all of the PCR testing and now injections seem to be somewhat loosely based on whatever they claim to have isolated, with the sequencing seemingly based off a fragment being akin to using computer modeling to fill in the blanks.</p></p>

        <p>You should`ve started with the very simple fact, that up to date the first virus sample never left China, every single country out there got just a sketch of something presumed to be a virus, based on which they developed a genome on computer at first, and then in lab using different DNA to complete it. At best, what they managed to do up to now, was to say it`s a pseudovirus, unable to replicate (check the penis pictures from today`s news on Covid19 and impotence). If those are accurate and untempered, and we`re actualy looking at a Sars-Cov2 virus in a human body, you still need alot more of those to have the disease, so it`s still nothing more than a huge farce.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As their game changed in the past weeks, and now they say it`s a blood disease, even more im inclined to think it`s not even a virus, but something related to blood cells, or those that form the endothelial tissue.</p>

        <p>I don't personally have enough knowledge to argue definitively in either case, but I feel like calling germ theory a hoax is just likely to cause the other person to stop listening. What i'd like to see is more open scientific debate between proponents of either one, without the rampant censorship and appeals to the orthodoxy. No one has all the answers, but science doesn't happen by silencing dissent, that's for sure.</p>

        <p>Yes. I just bring the end conclusion of what you will find once you spend dozens of hours on germ theory. Only those open to truth can take such a clue and work with it. Those offended are beyond help. No more time to beat around the bush. We have been lied to long enough.</p>

        <p>Profiteering how? Was there something he said, specifically that was wrong or is he scamming people somehow? I appreciated his initial talk on why Koch's postulates hasn't been fulfilled, if for no other reason than it got me thinking about stuff and then I subsequently discovered others speaking on the subject. I didn't see anything bad there.</p>
