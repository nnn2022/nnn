    <strong>I'm just not happy anymore</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sure a lot of you who've followed me or have seen me on here before has seen me post about my mental health. Well it hasn't gotten any better. </p>
<p>What do you mean? You might be asking. States including mine are opening up again you must be thrilled. That's the problem is these states that have prolonged this shit is leaving a huge mental wound on people. That even with things open again it's like why bother getting excited? It feels like we are one virus away from having everything taken away from us again. We live in a fucked up democratic world if you're not lucky enough to live in Florida or Texas.</p>
<p>It's like those fish in finding Nemo who spent their whole life from their tank wanting to get to the ocean only to get there and ask "Now What" that's literally how it feels. Things are open again great, but my social life with my friends and family outside of my home has disappeared. Everyone's either too scared to go out again or created their "bubble" of people. Transportation still requires you to mask up at least into September. </p>
<p>At the end of the day I just have no motivation to do anything. I have to force myself to go out so I can try to adjust and find another social group. Or try to reconnect with people who I haven't been able to see. Especially if I voiced my opinion on masks and vaccines. Can you imagine the backlash in a state like Massachusetts? With the pandemic keeping a lot of us home I just feel nothing anymore. It's almost impossible to feel excited or motivated. Yet propel don't give a shit about your mental health. People only care about two things.</p>
<p>If you wear a mask and if you're vaccinated.</p></p>

        <p>I've never made secret my opinions on masks and the vaccines.</p>
<p>It caused friction with my coworkers at my now former employer, who I quit for a far better job.</p>
<p>They'd pretend I was crazy, but I would just laugh at them and poke holes in their bullshit arguments. I even happily demonstrated how the masks don't work using a vape pen, they still could not accept it.</p>

        <p>It's not that I'm hiding it. It's just since I have been at home I haven't really met anyone new. I know masking and vaccines will be talked about if I were to try to meet new people again. Or see some old friends and family that I haven't seen and get grilled on about that.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna give you a bit of tough love now and take it or leave it. </p>
<p>Dont allow yourself to be a victim. Ever. You know you're in a bad place mentally right now so you have two options. To stay there or to figure out what things you can do to either reduce this mental anguish or get rid of it completely. You need to sit down and think about what you have control over. For me personally my diet and excercise routine has helped me a lot this last year, and without those two thing I'd probably be a lot worse off. These two things work for me however its not for everyone. You need to figure these things out for yourself.</p>

        <p>I feel this as well. I am in MI where our mandates are just starting to lift and while that's great, I wonder what will happen this fall/winter when the next "flu/bug/variant" that we're supposed to be scared of comes along and we shut down again. To be fair I was able to escape to FL and SC for almost 3 months this winter and it was glorious. I recommend traveling to a more open state or city if you can. Seeing people going about life as normal is so refreshing and makes you feel not crazy. Esp since even with the mandates lifting here, restaurants and businesses are still requiring masks and people are still walking around outside alone with them on where I live. It sucks and my husband and I feel like we hardly have any friends outside of our immediately family. But even if we drive 1.5 hours away to visit my parents in a more rural area, life is basically back to normal and most people don't give two shiz about any existing mandates. So if you can, travel or take a day trip to see that indeed the world has continued spinning and people have gone on with their lives. I know it's rough, but you're certainly not alone :)</p>

        <p>I know many going through this and it’s not just adults. Many children who were isolated and out of school from lockdowns are experiencing the same social anxiety/depression issues now that schools are opening back up. My husband and I are both vets with PTSD dealing with the desensitized feeling before the pandemic and the lockdowns did make it worse on us. Now that most mandates are lifted in our state we are slowly acclimating back into the world. Our daughter and hubby moved in with our grandson as they both recently just got out of the military and they are struggling with the lockdown effect too. We are all taking it one day at a time. My thought is this mess lasted over a year and it’s going to take some time to recover from it. Most importantly you are not alone in how you feel.</p>
