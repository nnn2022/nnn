    <strong>personal anecdote about behavior changes I’ve noticed in my family</strong>
    <p><p>TL;DR: my family went from anti-anything Covid to pro-govt and mandated experimental vaccines for children in a matter of months </p>
<p>this is my first post ever which I know seems sus bc it’s a new account but I’ve been reading this sub for months and I made an account because I just need to know if anyone else has observed this phenomenon. </p>
<p>My family has been very against masks and social distancing from the very beginning. They said around summer they wouldn’t get the vaxx if it came out and definitely would hate if it became mandatory. </p>
<p>Obviously something changed because they scheduled appointments as soon as it became available to them. And they said their reasoning was because they wanted to be able to ~go back to normal~ and they ~trust their friends who got it too~. </p>
<p>I don’t have a problem with them doing this, I know they think they’re making a good choice even though I personally don’t think that they are. </p>
<p>Anyways, I’ve recently had “conversations” with both of them (ended up becoming more like arguments by the end) where they were telling me I was throwing my life away by refusing the shot and began reciting the propaganda slogans like “they’re safe and effective” and “the side effects are temporary” and “do it to protect yourself and others” and “do it to get your freedom back”. </p>
<p>I am absolutely shocked in the change of behavior my family has shown in the last few months. These are people who didn’t wear a mask ANYWHERE, never social distanced, distrust the media and government, and used “sheeple” to describe various people on a daily basis. Not exactly the types of people you’d expect to start hurling propaganda slogans at their family members. I feel like I don’t know them anymore, they don’t stand for the same things they used to. </p>
<p>The doomer in me wants to attribute the bizarre behavioral change to the vaccines but the realist knows that we are in the midst of a massive social engineering experiment and that it’s likely working quite well, unfortunately. </p>
<p>Anyways, if you have any stories to share of bizarre 180 turns people in your life have taken over the last year and a half I’d love to read them and empathize with you. Prayers.</p></p>

        <p>My best friend, who I've known for over a decade; me and him have always been  libertarian, "go off-grid, stick-it to the man" types and suddenly he's fully vaxxed and insinuating that "you anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers were part of the problem"</p>

        <p>Same here. One of my closest and oldest friends of 25+ years was due to travel down the country for a visit. I spoke to him on the phone explaining how the government is lying (Ivermectin, stats about average age of death etc, and why I don’t wear a mask), and he admitted “I’m inclined to believe you.” And I could tell he was being persuaded.</p>
<p>A week later when he was due he said he won’t be able to make it as his car was broken down. Two days after that he’s posting his Pfizer covid vaccinated status on fb. I realised then that he lied to me, first time ever between us, because I think he knew I’d talk him out of it. Since then he simply cannot hear me and just keeps coming back to me being a ‘covid denier.’ I’ve actually lost him.</p>

        <p>Yeah absolutely. I had a very vivid dream about him recently. Essentially I bumped into him as I was making my way to the airport. It was really good to see him, like old times, and it was a very peaceful and joyful dream. He offered to drive me to the airport, we walked to the departure lounge and we embraced and I turned and walked towards my flight. </p>
<p>I think it was a goodbye.</p>

        <p>I have friends who are hard Ds, I’m a libertarian/conservative.  I talked to them last year, summer/fall, and we all agreed that Trump was pushing this through and that it wouldn’t be safe until 2023 at least.  Now, those same people won’t see me and are angry with me for my choice.  I’ve asked them why they did this after what we discussed and they just give me the hive-mind taking point “I just wanted to do my part to get things back to normal”.</p>

        <p>I agree.  I’m not anti-vaxx in the usual sense, I believe in vaccines.  I don’t believe in experimental gene therapy using a messenger method that has never been approved before.  This shot was intended for the old and vulnerable- not the young and healthy.</p>

        <p>Same here. The same way all experimental drugs are used. Use it on the people who have the most to benefit and least to lose. That in this case would be the old and ill, they should leave everyone else alone unless they VOLUNTEER to be a test subject</p>

        <p>I spent 18 months ranting and raving only to find out that a parent and sibling were vaxxed because (and I quote) "I didn't think much of it." As you can imagine, I respected their decision despite feeling extremely sad that they got vaxxed despite not having been coerced.</p>

        <p>The PR is strong plus in social circles its being reinforced by their peers or people they respect.    Theres no way for average joe to counter their peers narrative of the jab because they themselves just dont know anything about the science or sheer scale of manipulation going on regarding it.  So its just easier to follow the crowd, must be ok if everyone else is doing it.  They lived their whole life on that mantra.</p>

        <p>You’re right. They do respect their peers that were telling them it’s safe. (Though I know they don’t respect the people who told THOSE people it’s safe lol). I wonder if that’s why they’re taking it personally that I don’t want it, it would imply I don’t respect them since they just fell in line with people they respect. Interesting. Thank you for opening my eyes to a new perspective!!</p>

        <p>Majority of my coworkers were against getting the vaccine back in Jan/Feb. It is now July and they are all vaccinated except for one who is going to get vaccinated next week. Hippocrates, so easy for people to be swayed if you dangle the freedom carrot in their faces.</p>

        <p>Agreed! a lot of people don’t seem to realize this whole thing is about compliance. Whether the shots work or not is almost a non issue at this point (but still very important!) It’s whether the constitution works, whether our will to live free or die trying works.</p>

        <p>I’ve experienced this among own anti-covid-vax circles as well, but I expected it from day 1. Sticking to your beliefs requires courage; not every one is cut out for being authentic to themselves and accepting the resulting consequences.</p>
<p>That’s the essence behind the idea, “if you talk the talk, walk the walk.” </p>
<p>It’s common understanding that not many people “walk the walk” in various applications of of their lives…not just this one….it simply is what it is. </p>

        <p>Yes that’s why I shut the paranoid part of my brain off and realized it was because of the social pressure they’re around (as I said in the same sentence lol). I do think they’ve gotten more noticeably complacent since they’ve taken it, but ultimately that’s probably just down to the fact that more time has passed that they’ve been in that mindset.</p>

        <p>Just wanted to be sure I understood. I find your post interesting. Before the vax it could be several things but may be in connection with some subliminal shit that goes to their subconscious/unconscious and then being pushed into their conscious state automatically without them realising it...
And after vax well the fact that they did take it and can't go back and maybe stuff in it that too affect your behaviour... submissiveness and stuff...</p>

        <p>I can certainly agree with some viewpoints, that is not the issue, I can agree with the sub in the sense that nobody appreciates masks and distance as the 'new normal', but I despise people who do not understand science yet make the boldest claims about it, that spread fear and misinformation that fuels a lot of people's fear here that the world is going to end and comparable scenarios are unfolding. There is so much scientific research out there about the safety and effectiveness about the vaccine yet people here focus so much on 'interviews' and 'leaked' documents that people are being herded into fear and misunderstanding, all while calling other people 'sheep'. It's such a mess.</p>

        <p>I'm sure we could probably do without calling people "sheep", fighting anger with anger doesn't really solve anything. Every belief has its fanatics, and "conspiracy theorists" are no exception... but there are plenty of people here that are level-headed, which I know might be hard to see when you hold contrary opinions. I don't agree with your perspective, BUT it's not because I think you're stupid or because you're a "sheep", but because you and I have been exposed to different information. </p>
<p>If you're curious about our perspective; what we see, you still mightn't agree with it but maybe you could understand what angle we're coming from. I'll give one example, and to save face, I won't make it about vaccines:</p>
<p>a) regardless of whether it's in our better interests or not, perhaps you can appreciate that government mandates around the world have been extremely intense during this pandemic. And with such high compliance levels, this is what's known as a "foot in the door" in psychology. I won't explain it because I assume you're not stupid and can figure out its meaning. Governments like control because - all conspiratorial reasons aside - it keeps society in order. That's why we have laws. </p>
<p>But none of us were chosen to be born or to be raised in this world. Superficially, and to a point beneath the surface, we are products of our society. But at our cores, we're all conscious humans with dreams and fears and so on. So on places like NoNewNormal, we try our best to discuss things that are a threat to humanity's "humanness".</p>

        <p>You're trying to explain a psychological concept and the idea of laws to a PhD in law, who has also graduated in psychology. I'm trying to say: I know what you're talking about, and let me explain where I disagree with your argument.</p>
<p>Firstly, 'a foot in the door' does not mean that there is any interest in breaking down the door further; the foot can be all that they wanted to get inside. The foot can be the vaccination or the vaccination passport or whatever, we all perceive the foot to be a different thing based on our own perspective, you know, psychology. And, you can take this from a PhD in law, we don't have these covid measures because governments like control, we have them because they are in the people's best interest. If we do not have these invasive measures then the spread wound be out of control and the health systems would collapse, leading to uncountable deaths and a halt on a functioning society. The government isn't locking down society for 'control', it's locking it down to make sure we don't destroy ourselves, and you can see this in practice because every single time the government lifts the measures people forget the measures existed, forget about distancing etc and the virus spreads like wildfire again. Laws may help keep society in order, but you forgot the most important part: <em>in our own interest</em>. Without invasive measures, health systems, economic systems, remotely normal functioning would have collapsed. You say the government has laws because they want control, as a lawyer I disagree on a more fundamental level, but for the sake of the argument you simply mention that as a fact but you do not state if that is good or bad. In reality, based on the state of the world now and how it would've looked without covid measures, I would conclude that that is a good thing.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your academic merits, especially because I only have a Bachelor of Arts. For argument's sake, let's say the measures taken are in our best interest. </p>
<p>If you studied law and psychology, surely you're aware of the human capacity for corruption. Why are the modern leaders any exception when so many other evil leaders have ruled in the past?</p>
<p>Unfortunately we don't know how history looks until it's over. </p>

        <p>I am aware, but the trick is to evaluate the measures by their merits, like wearing a mask, social distancing. Just weigh the pros and cons. I am sure some governmental actions and their timings could've been better, there is always something to justifiably criticise. But the doom scenarios sketched in some subs are often ridiculous, always fueled by 'leaked information that 'they' did not want you to see!', it is exactly the type of 'fake news' and brainwashing that these people warn others about when they watch the news. There is no credibility there, it is not convincing.</p>

        <p>Well, you're right in the sense that none of the information I receive is credible by any tangible measure, but neither is mainstream media. Of course you say "Well, the news said that the scientists said..." but all news really is, on all sides is "he said she said". I work in media data analysis, the news is a television program like all others trying to acquire ratings. Lately, where I live, the news is the highest rated program of last week across 3/4 commercial networks. One of the main reason why ratings plays such a big role in the gambit is because companies pay to have their commercials run during high ratings shows. </p>
<p>I've seen so much drivel and garbage to numb my mind rotten, but instead I've developed an immunity to television and I've never heard an opinion other than "get the jab" on television, which makes me wonder why there's no room for debate: even just a tiny slice of a corner of a program. So if it's not the jab I'm deterred by, it's the coercion by media institutions, which, at least where I'm from, have lost my faith through first-hand exposure to how it operates.</p>

        <p>So your only reason for not getting vaccinated is because there seems to be a unanimous belief in media that vaccinations are good? What about the unanimous belief in media that the earth is roughly a sphere? Does this also make you doubt the shape of the earth? What about the unanimous belief in media that washing your hands prevents illness?</p>

        <p>No, and I never actually stated I was unvaccinated :) <br>
We have lots of reasons for not wanting to take the jab. Unfortuntely, you can't be convinced of any of them if you have already made up your own mind about how you feel, so I won't outline them :P</p>

        <p>Well the new vaccine is made on a novel technology.
One thar has not yet been successfully deployed for anything and thete were some seriously failed attempts, for example with animal testing where all the animals died. So this is the roof of the the danger of the technology - used improperly it can kill. But anything can. Yet this is the reason why caution is always advised. Most vaccines take around 10 years to test, develop and deploy, some more, some less. This product should stay strictly volunteer only with no additional incentives for taking it at least until the official date set for end of clinical trials. So, for example, 2023. This is common sense. </p>
<p>How does this compare with traditional vaccines? They operate on exposing the immune system to 
the dead or weakened pathogen.
The risks inherent in this approach are threefold:
-With live pathogen a sufficiently weakened body can actually catch it
-With rapidly mutating viruses like flu you can get immunity fpr one strain but be at higher risk from newer strains that would be way more prevalent in the environment by the time a flu shot for previous strain is developed
-And there is a risk caused by the agent used to contain /weaken the virus, be it lead or any other substance. This risk can likely be minimized by maling sure vaccinations are well apart from one another and to avpid vaccinating too young kids that are in critical part of their development and not all the safety precautions made with adults in mind can be enough.</p>
<p>Still two out of three risk factors are closely connected with the risks of the disease. It is really hard for such a vaccine to outweigh that of the disease itself, as long as the substance from point 3 is fairly safe and all the safety precautions are taken. One case where it might go otherwise is when disease is prwctoxally eradicated so you do not risk catching it but you still can face asverse reactions as with any other product. Since even painkiller might nearly kill you if you are unfortunate enough, as per the manufacturer notice.</p>
<p>Now the new technology does not use the virus but tries to act like a virus. It makes your own body to produce the protein used by the virus. But without viral load we do not know how the body will react. The theory is that the body learns to foght this protein, learning to neutralize the virus.</p>
<p>But it is yet to be proven if this is really that effective. It also can still lead to the same issues as flu shot, making new strains deadlier to those who had the shot.</p>
<p>And we are dealimg for very low risk virus compared to anything but flu shot. And remember that flu shots will not eradicate the flu, so reaching this level of efficiency is not enough for the goal of eradicating the virus - but no sane individual would set this kind of goal for a virus so widespread.</p>
<p>This new drug so far hardly counts as vaccine. It does not stop infection or spread. It lessens the symptoms but does not grant you immunity in amy sense. You can still get hospitalized and die from the virus woth it. So it cannot be the basis for any herd immunity. It won't protect those that cannot take it.</p>
<p>There is really nothing speaking for this drug except maybe for people already very old or very sick. But tjen tesring safety in such a group is impossible - if they die or get very serious side effects, it is easy to claim coincidence. And every drug hadls possible serious side effects and /or adverse reactions. This drug seems to be the most dangerous one recently, basing off the databases maintained for such a purpose. And all that for a disease far less dangerous than vast majority of what we use vaccinations against.</p>

        <p>I’m glad you found my post so interesting and thanks for asking. As a matter of fact, yes I consider that I may be in the wrong. I consider that I may be ignorant. I know one thing and that is that I know nothing. My first step to every problem I face: I understand my initial reaction might be wrong. I take the steps to challenge myself to see all other viewpoints. I take the steps to listen to those who vehemently disagree with my viewpoints. I take the steps to listen to those with my viewpoints. I absorb and analyze all of this information and sometimes I come to the same conclusion I did in the first place and sometimes I don’t. I have been wrong numerous times before, I have probably inadvertently already said something incorrect today.</p>

        <p>Anyways on the topic of being wrong (see previous reply), you seem to have missed the point of my post so please allow me to explain, if you would like to continue, so we can actually discuss the same topic. </p>
<p>I don’t think my family is crazy, I haven’t separated myself into an “us and them” scenario. My post was a vent sharing a situation in which people I know have completely changed their attitudes about life that they’ve had for decades. They went from being individualistic, free spirited, curious people to being collectivists, worried, and authoritative people. That is exactly what this social experiment is about changing people into and that’s exactly what it’s done. I’m mourning the people they once were, but I am willing to listen to them. It’s just that now I know it’s not them talking anymore which is saddening.</p>

        <p>Let's assume they understand what's going on with COVID-19. In this scenario, you find it strange that people become more collectivist and worried when they know their freedom and health is predominantly in the hands of other people? Wouldn't it be terribly naive to be individualistic and free-spirited in a time when contact with others can harm you? Something something Darwinism? This is exactly what I'm saying. It is explicitly not weird for them to change.</p>

        <p>Agreed, I think it would be naïve to cling to individuality and forgo the sake of the collective if we were truly in danger. That’s the whole argument of the pro lockdown pro mask people. I oppose those things mainly because they are completely unnecessary, especially for most of us, as well as dangerous. But if the virus was more dangerous, then I would accept those things with open arms. I would be out there, rallying for people to not touch their families or go shopping. It’s not strange behavior from someone who believes the virus is truly a danger. But they haven’t gotten any new information, they’ve seen the same data I have. They know it’s not dangerous and I don’t think they truly fear it, I suspect it’s just easier to try and fit in at this point. At one point, one of them said that to me anyways so that’s exactly what I think happened. </p>
<p>I can be wrong, covid can be MUCH more dangerous than any of the data shows, or anecdotes claim, or my personal experience provides. But since they have the same data and anecdotes I do and they haven’t learned anything new to suggest that it is… then it becomes a matter of drawing a conclusion based on interpretations which means neither of our conclusions can be wrong, but they should be respected. Information that used to make them feel safe now makes them feel scared and that saddens me, especially when the information itself hasn’t changed.</p>

        <p>I am not sure what I am supposed to be looking at? The weekly infection rate? And yes we can have different interpretations but that is exactly what we're talking about. Avoiding it is a way to remain ignorant. I have some info that can make you fear this virus, 600,000 people died of COVID in the USA alone. Some extra info: approximately 15% of people experience long-covid symptoms 3 months after infection, in the age group 25-34 years old the prevalence of long-covid symptoms was even higher with approximately 19%. Moreover, society as we know it could've ended if we had not gone in lockdown, as whole economic systems and health care systems would have had to shut down if the infection rate became out of control. <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021">https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021</a></p>

        <p>all of it is valuable information, so I shared the whole thing. My most important part though is near the end in the information about table 3 about comorbidities. Also, I guess it wasn’t fair of me to just say “scare me” without defining some parameters. While 600,000 people dying does sadden me, it does not scare me. What would scare me: highly accurate testing with high positivity rates, positivity rates = 50% or higher chance of death before recovery within any age range even if it’s not my own, 80% or higher chance of death with comorbidities, long Covid = permanent SEVERE lung damage 50% or more of the time in any age range. </p>
<p>(Bear in mind, I’ve already contracted it and recovered. It was a terrible experience and I wouldn’t want to repeat it or give it to someone else. I’m not heartless! I just don’t think it’s as transmissible as it’s said to be, I was around my husband and friends the entire time and no one around me got sick. Or maybe people are less susceptible to it than we’re said to be. This was early on before the isolation was expected as a rule, it was just a suggestion at that point. I also think I have some of the “long covid” symptoms, I feel that my lungs have slightly lowered capacity.) </p>
<p>Also I’m sure you’re gonna say I pulled those numbers out of thin air, they’re not scientific, no. They’re the numbers that would scare me though. My threshold for fear may be too high, I don’t know. I’m an adrenaline junkie I guess. But if I’m going to give you a challenge I guess you should know what my threshold is.</p>

        <p>I spoke of proper testing, transmission, long term effects, and my personal experience AS WELL AS mortality. Lockdowns and masks were implemented with mortality given as the reason to begin with. You say certain economic systems would have been stopped if we hadn’t locked down, would that be due to (expected) excessive mortality? It was to “stop the spread” yes, because we thought if the virus spread, then mortality upwards of millions would be inevitable. According to what I’ve seen, that’s not that case thus lockdowns = unnecessary. </p>
<p>It’s easy to say what “would have happened if we hadn’t done x, y, and z” but the fact is we’ll never know in the USA or UK because that’s not what we did. However, many other places did not shut down and we have the data to be able to estimate what truly would have happened. Truthfully, I haven’t done that analyzing yet and I am curious. I would like to compare how many lives saved vs how many lives lost due to lockdowns. Maybe that’s what I’ll do today lol. Or maybe you have the information already and I haven’t seen it.</p>

        <p>No it wasn't due to mortality, it would have been due to the vast majority of people in a country being sick at home or in hospitals - hospitals that could not function due to staff members being sick and an overflow of patients. Leading to many deaths not only covid-related but also other illnesses that require direct treatment but for which there is no staff nor resources available. Can you imagine when hospitals are no longer functioning? When police are extremely understaffed due to unprecedented sick leave? I can't believe you are not aware of this scenario, they explained it numerous times where I live: if the spread was not controlled, hospitals could no longer function, police, firefighters and so on would be understaffed, production, supermarkets, regular shops, all branches of economy would be affected due to massive amounts of staff members being ill. ON TOP OF THAT, millions would also die. You are here talking about why the measures are 'unnecessary' but you do not even know that hospitals, police and other public services would have collapsed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And... yes... we do know what happened if we hadn't done x, y and z, because that scenario unfolded in the USA and hundreds of thousands of people have died. When other countries were in lockdown the president of the USA was denying the existence of COVID like many people still do to this day. By postponing measures, the USA is the worst hit 'first world country' by COVID. They failed to act, and they are exactly the case study that you should look at.</p>

        <p>Many places in the US did shut down so I’m not totally sure what you’re on about. No not all places, but definitely most. In addition to all “non essential businesses” shutting down, that included many “non-essential” hospital services such as eye doctors, chemotherapy apparently, prenatal screenings, and more. So the way I see it, keeping everything open MIGHT have shut down industries and saved lives but locking down ENSURED industries shut down and I’m not sure it saved lives, but shutting down industries and businesses usually doesn’t bode well for quality of life so that’s my assumption but no I don’t know it for a fact. </p>
<p>Lockdowns and masks, when opposed, were usually reinforced by the mantra “if it saved one life…” so that indicated to me that it was all about preventing mortality, and rightfully so at the time. Given the numbers I’ve seen, this measure was unjustifiable after 2 weeks and it was unjustifiable to carry on until the present day. The measures are still in place, just not if you’re vaccinated. </p>
<p>Let’s stay on topic here. The point of my original post was to say that many people who have been strongly resistant to these measures are now compliant and it saddens me that they are now fearful. You wanted to know why I’m sad they’re fearful and I say according to the data, as well as my own personal standard for something that should change my life, it’s unjustified fear. I respect it but I disagree with you. I believe you’re trying to convince me that I should be afraid. You asked for a source for justification for my lack of fear, I asked for a source for justification for me to be afraid. We’re talking in circles right now, I’d like to get back on track.</p>

        <p>Yes sure, but too late! The spread was out of control, hence the infection rates and the amount of deaths. On the hospital topic we're not talking about the same thing. I'm talking about hospitals themselves not being able to function due to 1. Overflow of patients 2. Staff members being sick when no covid measures would have been taken. This would be catastrophic for covid patients and non covid patients. </p>
<p>But based on what do you think masks are unjustifiable? Scientific research shows they work and it's such a minimally invasive thing, why would this be unjustifiable?</p>
<p>So in the last paragraph you're trying to tell me that you would not be afraid of hospitals not functioning in case covid measures were not implemented? It's an unjustified fear to live in a society with no functioning hospitals? Hospitals having to pick and choose which people to treat? People with cancers not receiving treatments and having appointments cancelled. This is not an unjustified fear if you ask me. In fact, a close friend of my mom had a dear friend whose appointment to check on her cancer had been cancelled in a covid outbreak due to lack of resources.</p>

        <p>I feel like I’m being misunderstood. I want hospitals to be at full functioning ability. Lockdowns prevented that. </p>
<p>According to the data I shared, lockdowns were unnecessary and thus hospitals would not have been overwhelmed without them. Because of the rate of hospitalization and mortality which is what I shared. It also all depends on the demographics where people live. Perhaps a lockdown would be necessary in a place with mostly elderly and sick people and a tiny hospital with 20 beds available. In a place with a large hospital, or a very active of young population, it’s probably not necessary. One size fits all does NOT work with a country as large and varied as the United States is. </p>
<p>The data I have provided regarding the danger of covid doesn’t justify locking down the entire country, the numbers aren’t bad enough. At least not for 99% of people. I want to know what data you have that justifies to you locking down the entire country: young, old, healthy, sick, male, female… everyone. I’m open to it! I want to see it! Not to pick it apart but to understand why I may be on the wrong side of things.</p>

        <p>What data was that? I'll look at it if you can point me to it. Where I live, at one point the hospitals were full. I live in a country of roughly 20 million people. You keep referring to 99% as a mortality rate, but listen, the problem isn't the mortality rate when everybody is sick, the problem is that society cannot function normally when everybody is sick, here we're not talking about 1%, we're talking about the 70-80% of people that suffer mild to severe symptoms and can no longer work for the duration of their illness. Imagine that 70% of the working population is sick at home, if - conservatively - only 50% of a country is infected and - conservatively - 70% of of those stay home due to mild to severe symptoms then a country is in shambles. This is what I'm talking about.</p>

        <p>The mortality rate is 1% (ish), the SURVIVAL rate is 99% (ish). I sent you the data I’m talking about, it’s the CDC link I posted in the first place. I want the data saying that 70%-80% of people who get it experience severe symptoms. That’s what I’m asking for. </p>
<p>Also how infectious is it? I have searched and searched and I cannot find any information regarding how fast it spreads asymptomatically versus with symptoms. ie: if you have it, how likely is it that you will spread it to someone else in various situations. Yes, I’ve seen the cute little diagrams the government made about droplets going through masks, how loud you can sing, and liquor stores are safe but churches are not. I don’t know what information caused them to make those diagrams. I want to know. </p>
<p>Because then we can determine how many people would have actually had it at the same time and understand what actually needed to be shut down vs not and we can be prepared if we need to do this again.</p>

<p>Don’t act like mortality is a non-issue. It’s the main reason people are afraid and the main reason any of the measures were introduced, accepted, and enforced. There are other important things as well which I am discussing, but don’t dismiss mortality when it is a vital piece of information regarding danger.</p>

<p>I'm not at all saying mortality is a non-issue. I'm saying that reasons other than mortality were just as important for the measures to be imposed. Particularly in my country the other reasons were highly stressed: e.g. hospitals being full. As part of the youth group I have not much to fear of the mortality aspect, but long-covid is a real concern and so are full hospitals in case measures would not have been taken. You seem so calm about the idea of hospitals being full and dysfunctional due to sick staff, is this really the case or did you gloss over it?</p>

        <p>Okay well idk why, it was showing up as a 404 error. </p>
<p>I’ve pointed out and accepted many other reasons to worry as well, which you’ve ignored and continue to claim I’m only talking about mortality rate. </p>
<p>Of course I’d be concerned about too full hospitals. At least in my country, I don’t think it would have happened. Perhaps in some cities and counties, but it would’ve been temporary. Maybe in yours if you have smaller hospitals and a generally sick population, I don’t know. People said the hospitals were overwhelmed anyways even with the lockdown and I’m sure some of them were, but it was definitely not all of them and definitely not even most of them.</p>

        <p>I guess your country doesn't have a lot of people, but if roughly 9% of the population that gets COVID needs considerable medical treatment / hospitalisation - see the source - then that number can become enormous when you live in a large country. Imagine the US, where people are disproportionately unhealthy, overweight / obese the number of people needing medical help would be larger than 9%, no doubt. Imagine the US, 330 million Americans, imagine - conservatively - 50-60% infected due to no measures, and - conservatively - 10% needing hospitalisation or close monitoring. Then you need place in hospitals and doctors/nurses etc for 15 million people with serious / life threatening complaints that must be cared for at the same time, all the while also a large part of hospital workers, nurses, surgeons etc themselves are sick at home. In fact, statista notes that roughly, currently in the USA there are 919,000 hospital beds. The USA would be in enormous trouble.</p>
<p>It's about thinking of all the links in the chains that are affected when massive amounts of people get sick.</p>

        <p>I understand your points, I’ll address them in a second, but how come all the non-medical staff would come into the hospital to be treated, but the medical staff would stay home to be treated? That would actually detract from your point because if you say the medical staff goes to the hospital too, then they’d even be MORE overwhelmed. Give yourself some help here.</p>

        <p>I don't think I said that and if I did then I didn't mean it, that would be a strange distinction to make.</p>

        <p>You literally said they would be “sick at home”, I pointed it out because I’d like to know why the hospital workers wouldn’t be susceptible to the same percentages as everyone else when it comes to whether they’re sick in the hospital or at home.</p>

        <p>Yes I said 'sick at home' to signal that they could not work to help in the hospital, this is in relation to hospitals being under staffed. So sick at home in contrast to working in the hospital. Indeed, in reality the sick hospital workers would be another strain on the medical system/hospitals. Nevertheless, hospitals do tend to take somewhat stricter prevention methods and may have somewhat lower infection rates, just thinking out loud here.</p>
