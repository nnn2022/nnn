<p>(*Quote: ‚Äúresults show that coughing by influenza patients emits aerosol particles containing influenza virus and that much of the viral RNA is contained within particles in the respirable size range‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äú65 percent of viruses spread among flu patients consisted of small particles. Unfortunately, the generic face mask is not airtight and cannot offer protection against these smaller particles.

<p>‚Äú<em>the scientific data tells us that people who are without symptoms, with whom you don‚Äôt come into contact with body fluids, are not a threat, they will not get infected.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>EDIT to answer some questions: most of the actual data shows that masks provide a non-significant impact. Where the reports DO suggest to use masks, the majority of authors are not using their own numbers, rather, they are offering opinions and non-conclusive recommendations (including the idea that a mask might help to stop you from touching your face - which is not in the scope of ‚Äúmask effectiveness‚Äù or solid medical advice). Other reports do say that sick or at-risk people (only) should wear masks, but healthy or asymptomatic should not (which many on this sub agree with). However, suggesting that masks may be effective for this specific subsection of the population does not support the idea of a nationwide mandate for healthy people.</p>

        <p>Ok, so I read through some of these and I don‚Äôt think it is as simple as you made it out. Here are some examples from each article: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúHowever, use of face masks by well persons might be beneficial in certain situations (e.g., when persons at high risk for influenza complications cannot avoid crowded settings or parents are caring for ill children at home). Face mask use by well persons also might reduce self-inoculation (e.g., touching the nose with the hand after touching a contaminated surface).‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúMask use is probably correlated with type of exposure, which might further confound associations‚Ä¶‚Äù (This one is saying that the type of exposure they had may affect them more than if they wore a mask) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This article is from 2019, before COVID-19, and yes does say asymptomatic people don‚Äôt need masks, but with COVID-19 you can be shedding the virus days before you show symptoms, thus masks could help prevent infections. They say, ‚ÄúIf such symptomatic persons cannot stay home during the acute phase of their illness, consideration should be given to having them wear a mask in public places when they may have close contact with other persons‚Äù. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is about wound infections, not respiratory illnesses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both of the groups in this study wore masks, there was no control group with no masks to compare to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks are not to protect you from others, they are to protect others from you. If someone without a mask coughs on me there is a good chance I‚Äôll get sick, even if I have a mask, but, as the study itself says, ‚ÄúThey also showed that surgical masks substantially reduced particle release (especially for large particles)‚Äù, thus if I am wearing a mask and cough the chances of me infecting another person are reduced.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They say in their conclusion, ‚ÄúFacemask use demonstrated mixed results, but a randomized control trial suggests that it is effective.‚Äù Ultimately, they seem to recommend masks combined with handwashing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This link isn‚Äôt working for me </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is in regards to the Ebola outbreak in 2014, which is not an airborne disease and requires different measures to be taken. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My big takeaway from reading through all these is that masks alone won‚Äôt work (I don‚Äôt think anyone has every claimed that) but it‚Äôs a combination of different strategies that will ultimately help limit the impact of the virus.</p>

        <p>I wish I could upvote you more. The lack of critical thinking is scary.</p>
<p>The mask does doesn‚Äôt protect you from others giving you the virus. The majority of the world know that by now.</p>
<p>But it does protect other from getting the virus from you. Something people on this sub don‚Äôt care about, because a 0.4-1% death rate is ‚Äònothing‚Äô (literally the craziest thing I‚Äôve ever heard - that would kill 50-70m people worldwide if everyone got it) and because somehow wearing a mask is bad for people‚Äôs mental health.</p>
<p>Look I get the impact on people‚Äôs mental health, it‚Äôs fucking people up. But it‚Äôs a sacrifice for the greater good. Something your grandparents would have known, but which many of this generation has been mollycoddled into not learning</p>

        <p>it's pretty damn sad that after  11 months you actually don't realize this. Yes dude it protects you from spreading to others, not protecting you from getting it. That's why everybody wears a fucking mask.....</p>

<p>The general take away from every study pre 2020 is they really don't do much.</p>

        <p>You guys do realize that his is about he flu not corona right? This was a 2017 study conducted to see if masks prevented against the flu in a time when the virus didn't exist. Also, the CDC did say early on not to wear a mask but information changes. Stop spreading your BS. Wear a mask.</p>

        <p>I'm not going to argue against some article, not that it would be difficult either. Only one of your articles even have sources and only one of the sources are relevant to the point they're making. Either interact with the source material yourself and tell me what point you're trying to make, or admit that you can't.</p>

        <p>The point I'm trying to make is that the study isn't relevant to corona because the flu and corona aren't the same diseases . Of course they are similar to one another but in the end are not the same dieses.  How about you try and find some material to support that masks don't stop corona.</p>

        <p>Black men have a harder time with a clean shave. Up to 60% actually.</p>
<p>[Pseudofolliculitis barbae (razor bumps) is a common condition of the beard area occurring in up to 60% African American men and other people with curly hair. The problem results when highly curved hairs grow back into the skin causing inflammation and a foreign body reaction. Over time, this can cause keloidal scarring which looks like hard bumps of the beard area and neck. Shaving sharpens the ends of the hairs like a spear. The hairs then curve back into the skin causing pseudofolliculitis barbae.](https://www.aocd.org/page/pseudofolliculitisb#:~:text=Pseudofolliculitis%20barbae%20(razor%20bumps)%20is,other%20people%20with%20curly%20hair.&amp;text=Over%20time%2C%20this%20can%20cause,the%20hairs%20like%20a%20spear.)</p>

        <p>Surgical masks aren't effective against the WuFlu. So I'm not sure why you think a vacuum bag works. Afterall vacuum bags only filter out larger particles, and typically have a second or even third smaller filter for finer grains of dust. However even then a vacuum isn't capable of trapping virus particles due to their size.</p>

Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>

        <p>Did you read the article you linked to, or are you just doing copypasta?</p>
<p>If you recommend some people to wear masks, check how many of them got sick compared to control (to which you said nothing), and see no statistically significant difference, can you really draw a conclusion that masks "don't work"? You don't know how many people in test cell wore masks, you don't know how many people in control cell wore masks, your sample size is small, you don't know whether test cell and control cell have been exposed to the virus equally, and you don't measure the effect of source control at all.</p>

        <p>I disagree with your assessment. I find the study is more than applicable to the situation. Morso, I find it funny you've changed from saying it doesn't prove my point, to complaining about sample size and methodology. Feel free to show me a similar study.</p>
<p>There's no arguing with people like you, because you refuse to see reason. If I gave you a single source, you'd say it doesn't matter due to the fact it's an odd one out. </p>

        <p>Again, I've had numerous discussions on these articles. They've been "debunked" by people multiple times. Thing is, it's all nitpicky shit. </p>
<p>But hey, let's start at the simple shit. That medical masks don't work. But let's look at one of the primary reasons people think they do. Surgeons.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002929.pub3/full">We conclude that there is no clear evidence that wearing disposable face masks affects the likelihood of wound infections developing after surgery.</a></p>
<p>Yes, there are issues. Not entirely random base, however that's unlikely to actually cause a difference. Small sample size, however finding someone who is willing to go under surgery without a mask may be fairly hard. However overall it's a fairly decent study which is compelling. It's also apolitical, as it's from before masks were political, and is a study based off of the effectiveness of masks, and even asymptomatic spread, without actually delving into a specific situation. This also uses real people in a real situation where masks are used, and not applying a dummy with a new mask used for 10 minutes to a new York subway.</p>

        <p>You picked a good example. Wound infections are caused by bacteria. It is standard practice to give antibiotics to surgery patients. We know antibiotics work well against bacteria, therefore it is possible that even if surgeons were not wearing masks, that would not have a big effect on wound infections.</p>
<p>Likewise, if everyone was vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, there would not be a reason to wear masks.</p>
<p>If you seriously believe the arguments you listed, there's no way for me to change your mind. So I'll stop trying.</p>

        <p>Issue is infections can still happen with antibiotics. </p>
<p>This study was to see if there was a possible vector of transmission coming from the surgeons mouth/nose.</p>
<p>There was not. </p>
<p>The current narrative right now is even with your vaccine, you need to wear a mask as there's no evidence you cannot carry or transmit the virus. </p>
<p>You've posted nothing of value.</p>
