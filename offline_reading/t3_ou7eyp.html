    <strong>Why did this get made?</strong>
    <p><p>Have any of you noticed podcasts being infiltrated by what appears to be actual, intentional, prepared propaganda for these vaccines? I'm talking like giving over a significant portion if not all of the episode to something that sounds like a prepared script.</p>
<p>I noticed this first a week ago with the "All-In" podcast (episode 40 to be precise). Discussion of the vaccines, COVID, and everything related is not off-topic for that pod, but, in that episode, they spent the first hour of the pod aggressively arguing for the mandatory vaccination of EVERYONE. This was completely at odds with everything they'd said in previous podcasts and, so far, in following podcasts. It was so weird. It really seemed like someone paid them to read a script for an hour.</p>
<p>I've noticed this in a few others that at least touch on current events, but just now a new episode of the "How Did This Get Made" podcast dropped with this nonsense. If you don't know, that's a podcast where several comedians deconstruct the ridiculousness of ridiculous movies. It's usually absolutely hilarious. It has nothing to do with current events much less "vaccine hesitancy". Yet, this episode was entirely handed over to an ER nurse from Missouri (y'know where a "pandemic of the unvaccinated" is totally raging and, between podcast appearances and TikTok dance numbers, people (including and especially children) die in this nurse's arms every single day bitterly regretting having not taken the vaccine). One of the hosts plays a "vaccine hesitant" person and the ER nurse debunks the assumptions that have made her hesitant. E.g. if you think there are some perverse financial incentives here, whoa buddy are you wrong. Nobody's making a dime on this thing! so says the ER nurse from Missouri on the comedy podcast...</p></p>

        <p>You're not imagining this. It almost certainly is happening. You don't even have to have that big of a following before you start getting contacted for opportunities like this...</p>
<p>And remember -- since the vaccines aren't FDA approved, they can't be advertised... And yet, they are more profitable than most drugs.</p>
<p>So there's an ENORMOUS marketing budget, and it's just getting routed through indirect advertising like what you heard in these podcasts.</p>

<p>Yeah... I've seen in family members (not my own kids) that this is working exactly as intended. sigh</p>
<p>This is madness. Why do they want the shots in children so badly? How does this end?</p>
