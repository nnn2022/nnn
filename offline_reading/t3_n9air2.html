        <p>If voting actually made a difference, they wouldn't allow it. Look at Trump's 2016 victory. He wasn't supposed to win. The Democrats and establishment RINOs rigged the election for Hillary but they didn't anticipate the meme wars (or meme magic, whatever you want to call it) and Trump's extreme level of persuasion ability, his ability to work large crowds so he basically won a rigged election because it wasn't rigged enough and boy did the establishment get royally pissed off. They sure course corrected for 2020 didn't they? They had all of big tech in their pockets censoring and banning anyone that helped Trump win in 2016, they changed election rules to favor mail-in voting even before the Rona outbreak (almost as if they knew something!) and one domino after another all lead to Trump having no chance to win 2020.</p>

<p>I think we know that unless we come out in overwhelming numbers they will continue to steal elections.  But there has to be a tipping point when the numbers are so massive they simply cannot conjure up enough phony votes to win.  People better wake up and come out in every local and state election and vote out every politician that endorsed this covid forever bullshit.</p>

        <p>So many swing states <em>didn't</em> do an about face.  Arizona elected a Democratic Senator before the election.  Wisconsin and Michigan have been vacillating for the past four elections.  Biden won Michigan by a larger margin than Donald Trump did in 2016.</p>
<p>And no.  There isn't a statistical basis for it.  Georgia and Arizona have done multiple recounts and there's no evidence of voter fraud.  Again, blaming mail in voting and claiming it is fraudulent is a well known Trumpist talking point that has no basis in reality.</p>

        <p>the founder of Cyber Ninjas (the company contracted by the Arizona GOP to recount) is a known purveyor of conspiracy theories and has been peddling what is essentially a far right talking point that the election was unfair and was [stolen] (https://apnews.com/article/elections-government-and-politics-election-recounts-arizona-025a0370563bb095f5f96f17710daa26).  Furthermore, the AZ Senate has earmarked 300,000 for something that is over and done with because the far right can't accept that Donald Trump was a really bad candidate and that they lost because of it.  They're literally looking for bamboo ballots.</p>
<p>&rt; To even think a zombie like Biden, who can't even remember his name or compete a coherent sentence has won is.. delusional to say the least.</p>
<p>Americans elected Donald Trump in 2016.  He can barely string a coherent sentence together.  He had a chance to win an election, and he just as easily could've won this one if he didn't completely mismanage Covid (among other things).  He lost because he was a shitty president.</p>
<p>Your reasoning doesn't make any sense.  Ronald Reagan got reelected when he very well could have had early onset Alzheimers.</p>

<p>Congress earmarked funding via Operation Warp Speed.  Vaccines typically are developed fairly quickly and take a while to get FDA Approval.  That's not new.  And he did mismanage covid.  Remember when he said we'd be open by Easter?  Or when he attempted to push bleach and hydroxychloroquine as treatments?  Or when he undercut his own research apparatus because they said what he didn't want to hear?  Or maybe how he ordered his own citizens tear gassed for a photo op?</p>

<p>Pfizer didn't take Federal Funding for their vaccine.  What did Donald Trump do to make us have vaccines quicker?  Congress earmarked funding for them via the CARES Act.  And then the GOP couldn't even vote on the HEROES Act because it was inconvenient.</p>
<p>The public private partnership did work with Moderna and J&amp;J.</p>
<p>&rt; Just admit it, you just don't like Trump. You probably don't know why either. He could save children from drowning and you'd still find a reason to call him out.</p>
<p>I don't like him.  He represents the worst aspects of Americans.  He instigated an idiotic trade war with China for no reason because they are "easy to win", he "renegotiated" the name of NAFTA.  It's essentially the same agreement but with a new name on it.  He also defended Nazis at the Unite the Right Rally as "good people".  So yeah, I don't want him representing me.  Also, the tax plan that he signed off on hurts anyone who's not rich while also hurting people who live in states that didn't vote for him.  It was venal and just mean spirited.  I can keep going if you want.</p>
<p>&rt; He was winning by a landslide on election day, until the key states suddenly interrupted the counting.</p>
<p>This is false.  He attempted to manufacture 13000 votes in Georgia so he would win; and it got recorded.  Reffensburger voted for Trump but cared enough about elections to stand up for them.  </p>
<p>&rt; Went to sleep and Trump was 700 000 votes ahead in PA.. woke up and Biden was ahead of him. If you don't think that's very, very suspicious, then yeah.. orange man bad.</p>
<p>It's almost as if ballots still got counted while you slept.  There is no evidence of voter fraud from mail in ballots.  It was expected that more Democratic votes would come in via mail.  Writ large, people voting for the Democratic party were far more likely to vote by mail/vote absentee because they took the pandemic seriously.</p>
<p>&rt; If you don't think that's very, very suspicious, then yeah.. orange man bad.</p>
<p>He represents a party that cares more about power and invalidating elections when they lose than actually doing anything.  It's why they couldn't revoke the ACA.  They spent ten years complaining about it and couldn't even get a replacement plan in place.  Tax cuts don't work for their expected purpose.  They just cost everyone a lot of money.</p>
<p>As president, Donald Trump did a great job of rubberstamping everything Mitch McConnell sent his way while also going on Twitter and wasting all our time and brainpower.</p>

        <p>&rt; It's funny you say he 'mismanaged COVID'. The reason why we had these "vaccines" so quickly IS Trump.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical companies began development of vaccines in early- to mid-January and were in the finishing stages of developing the vaccines for production for trials in early March, when Trump was still saying that COVID was a hoax.</p>
<p>&rt;Everyone made fun of him when he said we'd have a shot by the end of 2020. HE DELIVERED!</p>
<p>OK.  He also promised that there would be 100 million vaccine doses delivered by the end of 2020.  A far cry from the 2.2 million administered in 2020, no?</p>
<p>&rt;Just admit it, you just don't like Trump. You probably don't know why either. He could save children from drowning and you'd still find a reason to call him out.</p>
<p>I won't speak for /u/dans_cafe, who says that they don't like Trump representing them.  I'm gonna go ahead and say yeah, I do fucking hate Trump.  There are completely valid reasons to hate him.  But that doesn't mean that I'm unable to evaluate his performance.</p>
<p>&rt;He was winning by a landslide on election day, until the key states suddenly interrupted the counting.</p>
<p>That's not how elections work.  There's not "winning by a landslide"  when tens of millions of votes aren't counted yet.  One only "wins by a landslide" after the votes are counted.</p>
<p>&rt;Went to sleep and Trump was 700 000 votes ahead in PA.. woke up and Biden was ahead of him. If you don't think that's very, very suspicious, then yeah.. orange man bad.</p>
<p>So, here's what we know:</p>
<ol>
<li>The method by which people voted was very partisan.  We know that GOP voters tended to vote in-person and Democratic voters were more likely to vote by mail: there were a little over 550,000 mail-in votes from GOP voters, and more than 1.6 million mail-in votes from registered Democrats.</li>
<li>While counties could start counting mail-in ballots on election day at 7am, many did not.</li>
<li>It is much slower to verify, record, and then feed the ballot through the machine than it is to have voters do it themselves and look at the in-person vote totals at the end of the night.</li>
<li>So on election night, when totals began to be released, they were looking at a subsection of votes that heavily skewed to conservative voters while not yet looking at a subsection of more liberal voters.</li>
</ol>
<p>And you know what?  People warned that this was going to happen and many voters aren't sophisticated enough to understand that's what was going on.  It's why there were a lot of bills introduced into state legislatures to start counting mail-in ballots earlier.  It makes sense--not only would we get more accurate returns earlier on Election Day, not only would the final total come much more quickly, not only would we not have this weird counting quirk, but people who were voting in-person were getting their ballots counted, so do the mail-in ones, too.  </p>
<p>There's not really a reason to not allow counting of votes earlier, particularly when there's a huge number of mail-in votes coming in.  Well, the one reason to not want to allow would be if you <em>want</em> to have what happened on election night actually happen.</p>
<p>So yeah, one party blocked legislation in a number of swing states to allow the counting of mail-in ballots like they do with in-person ballots.  They wanted this to happen.</p>

        <p>&rt;It's funny you say he 'mismanaged COVID'. The reason why we had these "vaccines" so quickly IS Trump.</p>
<p>No, no it isn't. It's because of science and because Congress funded it.</p>
<p>&rt;Everyone made fun of him when he said we'd have a shot by the end of 2020. HE DELIVERED!</p>
<p>Nobody did this. Pharmaceutical companies started promising this. He then repeated what they said. He isn't responsible for the vaccines. </p>
<p>&rt;Just admit it, you just don't like Trump. You probably don't know why either. He could save children from drowning and you'd still find a reason to call him out.</p>
<p>Most people who don't like Trump know exactly why. It's because he's human scum.</p>
<p>&rt;He was winning by a landslide on election day, until the key states suddenly interrupted the counting.</p>
<p>No he wasn't. Counting was not interrupted. Mail-in ballots, which were primarily democrat, started being counted on election day and started being added to the immediately available electronic voter counts in most states. Most key states had rules set up by Republicans to not allow any mail-in ballot counting until the day of the election. Which is why there were huge mail-in ballot counts added. He was never winning by a landslide, though. </p>
<p>&rt;Went to sleep and Trump was 700 000 votes ahead in PA.. woke up and Biden was ahead of him. If you don't think that's very, very suspicious, then yeah.. orange man bad.</p>
<p>No shit. They continued counting into the late night, and began early in the morning. It's not fucking suspicious at all that PA mail-in ballots (one of the states that specifically made rules that they could not be counted until the day of the election - wonder why ) that were largely democrat started creating an equal playing field. </p>
<p>It's like you can't use an ounce of logical thinking to realize why early returns were heavily Republican when Trump told Republicans to vote on election day, while democrats turned out to early vote and mail in their ballots. It's almost like his 6 months of yelling rigged election was planned. Wait - it was planned. </p>
<p>You just hung on every word he said as the truth and then believed what he said when the most obvious fucking conclusion to mail-in ballots being largely democrat votes for Biden since Trump told his supporters not to mail-in vote would be that people who didn't support Trump didn't listen to his demand that they not vote via mail-in ballot.</p>

        <p>I have litteraly never once heard of this. I heard they got denied a courtcase, and weren't even able to represent the evidence that you so claim is missing.</p>
<p>And what kind of point is, " by judges Trump appointed...", isn't the pourpuse of them to look at things objectivly regardless of their personal believes or loyalty ?</p>
<p>If you want evidence of shady dealings in the us election, look for it, you'll find it. Like when they massively tried to push mail in Voting, or claimed that voter id is rascist for some reason.</p>
