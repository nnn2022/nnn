    <strong>The dehumanization of those who oppose pandemic measures is something we should all be worried about</strong>
    <p><p>Reading through posts on Reddit/Twitter recently has really disturbed me. I'm seeing an insane amount of dehumanization of people who are not in the pro-New Normal in-group. </p>
<p>I can't help but notice that it paralleled what I learned about the buildup to the Holocaust when I was in school, many moons ago. </p>
<p>Once I started looking more into that, I became quite dismayed. The similarities to what the Germans did to the Jews are quite shocking. </p>
<p>Stages of Genocide, and the definitions, were viewed on the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust website - https://www.hmd.org.uk/learn-about-the-holocaust-and-genocides/what-is-genocide/the-ten-stages-of-genocide/ </p>
<p>As an important note - remember that genocide is about in-groups and out-groups, NOT necessarily racial/ethnic/religious groups. One does not have to be a racial/ethnic/religious minority to be the victim of a genocide. </p>
<p>Furthermore, to the inevitable comments that will be along the lines of, "oh my God, this guy is NOT comparing wearing a mask or postponing a haircut to the Holocaust," I have this to say. </p>
<p>My decisions to not get a COVID vaccine or wear a mask or otherwise be subject to these arbitrary changes to my life are on par with my religious beliefs in terms of how deeply-held they are. </p>
<p>I would also add that they are part and parcel of my religion, although I will not be delving into my beliefs, as they are not important to disclose here. </p>
<p>For myself and many like me, these beliefs are non-negotiable. Telling me to renounce them and acquiesce to in-group pressure would be akin to telling a Jew to renounce Judaism and convert to Christianity to avoid the wrath of the Germans. </p>
<p>In other words - it is a non-option. I do not have the ability to easily become a part of the in-group. It would mean acting contradictory to my most sincere values and beliefs in order to avoid personal harm. I would imagine most people here feel the same way. </p>
<p>Someone will say, "it's just a piece of cloth, it's not a big deal. Just wear the damn thing already."</p>
<p>I would ask them, "would you tell a Muslim woman that her hijab is "just a piece of cloth?" Is a Jewish man's yarmulke just a "small bit of fabric?" Do you have the right to tell them what they can or cannot wear?"</p>
<p>If people were demanding that these individuals remove these articles of facial/head covering to conform to the norms of the Christian/secular in-group, there would be outrage. And rightfully so - they are not just "pieces of cloth," and neither is a face mask. </p>
<p>The wearing of clothing (or lack thereof,) especially over the face, is a deeply personal matter. It is not as simple as "just wear the damn mask."</p>
<p>And that is to say nothing of the vaccine or vaccine passport, which are larger issues by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, here are the ten stages of genocide, as well as how they apply in the present. </p>
<p>Classification - "The differences between people are not respected. There’s a division of ‘us’ and ‘them’ which can be carried out using stereotypes, or excluding people who are perceived to be different." </p>
<p>How is it seen currently? The differences in beliefs about bodily autonomy "are not respected." People who are against coercion of pandemic measures are now the "out-group," and are not worthy of being part of society. </p>
<p>Symbolisation - "This is a visual manifestation of hatred. Jews in Nazi Europe were forced to wear yellow stars to show that they were ‘different’." </p>
<p>As of right now, the unvaccinated are required to use masks while their peers are not. This mask-wearing shows them as someone who must be feared and avoided, and is a highly-visible reminder that they are not part of the in-group. </p>
<p>Discrimination - "The dominant group denies civil rights or even citizenship to identified groups. The 1935 Nuremberg Laws stripped Jews of their German citizenship, made it illegal for them to do many jobs or to marry German non-Jews." </p>
<p>Similar to what the quote says about the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, those who are now in the out-group are being locked out of many types of work. A substantial amount of employers, schools, and other organizations/individuals require adherence to pandemic measures before one can be employed or participate in society. </p>
<p>Dehumanisation - "Those perceived as ‘different’ are treated with no form of human rights or personal dignity. During the Genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as ‘cockroaches’; the Nazis referred to Jews as ‘vermin’." </p>
<p>This part should scare anyone who sees it. How many times do you see terms like "plague rat" or "disease vector" used to describe people now in the out-group? Quite often. I frequently see people calling for people like myself to be rounded up and exterminated like vermin or insects for "the greater good" or "public safety." </p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you agree with me about bodily autonomy, COVID measures, or literally anything else, we should all be disgusted and disturbed by the dehumanization of our fellow man. Not once has that ever ended well. </p>
<p>Organisation - "Genocides are always planned. Regimes of hatred often train those who go on to carry out the destruction of a people." </p>
<p>We are seeing now a concerted effort from the unholy alliance of the government, big business, and the in-group to make everyone unable to function without being a part of the in-group. </p>
<p>From business to school to church to the doctor's office, we are being taught to fear and hate those who are in the out-group. </p>
<p>From a young age, children are now being taught to fear those who forgo masks or vaccines. That we are filthy vermin to be afraid of. Long term, this will lead to a generation of children becoming a generation of adults that cannot fathom living in a pre-New Normal world. </p>
<p>Over time, the pressure will progressively be increased, until it ends in extermination. It will be nearly uniform through the country, as the CDC is organizing this, and the in-group follows their every command when it comes to ostracizing others. </p>
<p>At first, it will start out small - no large events without adherence to various measures. </p>
<p>"Reasonable, right? We don't want superspreader events, right? Nobody needs to go to a concert, right?" </p>
<p>Then, no medium-sized events without being in the in-group. </p>
<p>"Bars and restaurants spread disease like crazy. Nobody HAS to go out to eat or drink. Nobody is stopping you from drinking a beer or eating food, you InfoWars-watching conspiracy theorist. You can still go to the store, buy those things, and consume them at home. It's just not safe to let you be around other people in confined areas. Your rights end where someone else's comfort begins." </p>
<p>After, it will become impossible to even do something as minor as go to the grocery store to buy your food without proof of being in the in-group (such as a blockchain-based non-forgable vaccine passport.) </p>
<p>"The CDC says that now grocery stores are hotspots for COVID-202X. You're literally killing little old grandma who has to go shopping for milk and yarn for her innocent snow-white kittens, you murderer. </p>
<p>Remember, private business can do whatever they want. It's not the government keeping you from eating, therefore there is no tyranny or violation of rights. Never mind the fact that a handful of big corporations own nearly everything in many areas, and all move in lockstep with the demands of the in-group, who the government represents. </p>
<p>If you have a problem, start your own grocery store and develop your own supply chain for every single item that you need. </p>
<p>What's that? That's impossible without a ludicrous amount of capital? Sounds like you just don't like the free market. HA! Owned, conservitard. Something something cake shop ruling." </p>
<p>Lastly, it will culminate in extermination of those who are in the out-group. Once there are few of them left, they will be wiped out to "prevent future threats." </p>
<p>"They literally are plague rats. The 15x mutant X.X.X.X.X.X variant out of New York is spreading like wildfire, and our precious MRNA vaccines don't protect against it! That's the last straw. We have to stop the spread - for good. </p>
<p>We wouldn't have qualms about crushing cockroaches in our kitchen - so why would we be bothered by getting rid of these vermin and ending disease?" </p>
<p>Polarisation - "Propaganda begins to be spread by hate groups. The Nazis used the newspaper Der Stürmer to spread and incite messages of hate about Jewish people." </p>
<p>Media - both social and traditional - is fostering hatred of the out-group currently. There has been a neverending stream of fear pieces about how the CDC (who in-group members were only months ago saying were infallible due to their massive budget and research capabilities) must be wrong in their determination that the vaccinated don't need masks. </p>
<p>There is a constant stream of articles talking about how those who refuse vaccination will result in a much deadlier variant becoming prevalent. This fear porn serves to deepen the hatred towards the out-group, and increase the pressure on them to acquiesce. </p>
<p>There are battle lines being drawn right now. You either agree with every pandemic measure and blindly adhere to the edicts of those in power, or you are an "antivaxx plague rat who intentionally is torturing granny to death with your mere existence." </p>
<p>There is no room for nuance - there is no "well, I don't feel comfortable putting a vaccine into my body when there is no liability for the highly unethical companies that researched and developed it, and there is no longitudinal data supporting it's efficacy or safety. I'd like to wait." </p>
<p>To many people, holding that belief is no different than taking a gun, going down to the retirement village, and blowing granny's head off. </p>
<p>If you wish to remain in the in-group, and retain your privileges and higher social status, you must sacrifice your bodily autonomy and become a part of the unquestioning hivemind. You must do everything you are told, when you are told, or you will become a part of the out-group. </p>
<p>If you go on social media (especially Twitter/Reddit from what I've seen,) you can find countless examples of people wishing torturous death upon members of the out-group. </p>
<p>I can't tell you how many times I've seen supposed healthcare professionals opine things on social media like: "I hope that they get COVID and die squirming and begging for aid, so that I can laugh at them and refuse to help as they get their just deserts." </p>
<p>These people have a large capacity for harm in their role as a healthcare provider, yet people cheer them on? In what world is that a good thing, where your doctor or nurse may intentionally harm you based on their preconceptions about your value system? </p>
<p>Would anyone be happy if a doctor or nurse said, </p>
<p>"I don't agree with the teachings of Islam, Christianity, or Judaism. They are barbarous stone-age religions responsible for the deaths of millions throughout history. </p>
<p>I'm going to intentionally deny treatment to/mistreat any Muslims/Christians/Jews that I am responsible for, and I will be morally virtuous for doing so and stopping the spread of such poisonous ideology which directly harms countless others." </p>
<p>We would all be horrified. And rightfully so - nobody should have to choose between their faith (or deeply held personal convictions) and access to quality medical treatment. </p>
<p>This belief has been a part of medicine since Hippocrates made his famous oath. </p>
<p>Maybe the truth is that the "empathetic" side is not so empathetic after all. </p>
<p>Perhaps, they simply have a power fetish, and now wish to exercise it against those that they deem inferior. </p>
<p>Perhaps it was never about "saving grandma," but rather about finally having government, big business, and public opinion supporting their superiority complex. </p>
<p>Perhaps the othering, discrimination, and eventual action against the out-group is not really about protecting anyone, but rather a chance for the least ambitious among us to finally get the violent catharsis they have fantasized about for years. </p>
<p>I would argue that we have not gotten past this point quite yet. Some might disagree. I feel that in the coming five years, that will change. Maybe it will be COVID-related, maybe it will be due to something else. But there is something very bad brewing right now. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, I included the last four stages in order to give a view of what's to come. </p>
<p>Also, as food for thought - when the unvaccinated population is only ~10% of the US, and "new variants" are being blamed for countless deaths, do you feel that anyone will have qualms about those people being wiped out? </p>
<p>I don't. It will be seen as a public health measure or a matter of "cleansing" the "pestilence" of the unvaccinated. </p>
<p>Only time will tell. </p>
<p>Preparation - "Perpetrators plan the genocide. They often use euphemisms such as the Nazis' phrase 'The Final Solution' to cloak their intentions. They create fear of the victim group, building up armies and weapons." </p>
<p>Persecution - "Victims are identified because of their ethnicity or religion and death lists are drawn up. People are sometimes segregated into ghettos, deported or starved and property is often expropriated. Genocidal massacres begin." </p>
<p>Extermination - "The hate group murders their identified victims in a deliberate and systematic campaign of violence. Millions of lives have been destroyed or changed beyond recognition through genocide." </p>
<p>Denial - "The perpetrators or later generations deny the existence of any crime." </p>
<p>The whole point of genocide education is that we learn from it and stop future ones. We cannot undo the Holocaust - but we can prevent the next one. </p>
<p>Start paying attention to the dehumanization of those in the out-group. It is scary what is happening. Anyone with common sense should see that with that happening, we are marching towards something awful.</p></p>

        <p>Spent a bit on r/covidiots yesterday. Saw several people saying that those without the vaccine <strong>DESERVE TO DIE</strong> and how the world would be better off without them.  Gang mentality, hive mind whatever. It’s sad that they don’t even notice how sick in the head they are.  Same people who say “my body, my choice” are the ones who say not getting a vaccine is morally wrong and those who don’t DESERVE TO DIE.</p>

        <p>Very long, but VERY accurate and VERY on point, in my humble opinion.  I identify completely with your stance regarding, "these beliefs are non-negotiable...".  This goes FAR deeper in me than just a political choice.  Amen!</p>

        <p>Very scary but I think their plans may be falling apart. They want to use masks to identify the vaxxed from the unvaxxed but the vaxxed still want to wear the mask. They didn’t fall for the rising above vermin status symbolism of taking the communion from lord fauci. The businesses that want to implement a vaccine passport are getting so much hate that they’ll probably need to close down. Hopefully people stay strong and don’t give into the pressure to get vaccinated. The vax may use a magnetized protein to mind control people and turn them against everyone else.</p>

        <p>Good points! I hope that the businesses requiring passports will continue to get hate and lose revenue. The opposite is happening with masks- people unvaccinated are going without and people vaccinated are still too afraid or don’t want to look Republican, to take them off. Do you have any links to the mind control theory? I am very interested in that rabbit hole.</p>

        <p>Sadly this isn't falling apart any more than what we went through in 2001 era was falling apart. The change people were put through, then, is in part what made what's happening today possible.</p>
<p>And what's happening today will make the next thing possible.</p>
<p>This is incrementalism, except it's moving so quickly now you can see it happening.  All evidence is -- we're in for an incredibly rough decade.</p>
<p>It's absolutely not over, because an economic crisis is at the heart of this and it's still bubbling under the surface.</p>
<p>Look up the fed repo market interventions and you'll see today it jump to over 350 billion. ( ! ) This is the kind of activity that happened before 2008 and also September 2019.  Also notice - US media is suspiciously silent about it.</p>
<p>This tells you that it's incredibly likely that something significant will happen economically (and/or something bigger in real life to obscure it) in 3-5 months.</p>
<p>At the VERY LEAST it shows the Fed struggling to keep interest rates down, and we know an economic chain reaction of doom will happen if they rise. But there is an equal-but-different chain reaction if they print their way out of this.</p>
<p>There is no stability ahead, except perhaps in the short term. Enjoy it while it lasts. :-/</p>

        <p>Which is why we need to be extremely vocal about the fact that the people dying will all be the vaxxed. Everywhere! We have to bring it up over and over and over again so it can not be buried. No matter how uncomfortable or unpleasant it will be to bring it up, we need to. "Oh how sad about uncle Leo.

<p>That part of the new abnormal is now and always has been the most sinister and disturbing part for me also and I've been screaming about it for months.

        <p>I can't tell you how many times I heard throughout my schooling how bad dehumanization was, and what it has been responsible for. </p>
<p>I sat through so many Holocaust lessons in various classes over the years, and it was constantly reinforced that genocide did not start with Jews being forced into cattle cars and thrown into ovens, but rather through the use of softer methods. It was more of a frog in a pot of slow-boiling water situation than an immediate escalation to mass murder.</p>
<p>The whole point of education is to learn AND apply that knowledge. What we are seeing today is nearly identical to what has been done in the past to others who ended up as the victims of genocide.</p>
<p>Jews have been dehumanized and compared to insects or rodents for centuries (if not millennia,) and have been victims of ethnic cleansing all throughout the world for pretty much their entire history.</p>
<p>Black Americans were dehumanized and deemed animalistic, and public opinion was that they were deserving of their position as beasts of burden during slavery as a result. Many antebellum southerners genuinely believed that black Americans were on par with animals you would find on a farm, and therefore were not worthy of even basic human rights.</p>
<p>In pretty much every land ravaged by European colonialism, the natives were dehumanized and termed "subhuman" in one manner or another. The Europeans saw themselves as being justified in murdering them, torturing them, raping the women, claiming their land, and destroying their cultures before replacing them with the "superior" European ones.</p>
<p>In many cases, the Europeans believed that it was their moral imperative to do so. The concept of the White Man's Burden was a major impetus for the colonization of much of the world.</p>
<p>In all of these examples, the same basic principle applies: if they are not people, why would it matter if you harm them? Do you ever stop to think before you crush a cockroach in your kitchen, or run over an anthill with your lawn mower?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if they are potentially dangerous by virtue of their existence, would you not be morally wrong to permit them to exist? You would be permitting evil to run rampant.</p>
<p>By promulgating this line of thought, one has now created a crusader, who believes that it is his moral responsibility to smite the out-group. </p>
<p>This never ends well, like you said. I'm honestly shocked that seemingly nobody has commented on it. It's one thing to have a difference of opinion on something such as mask use or vaccination. But we should all be scared of what is to come when dehumanization becomes the norm.</p>
<p>I believe that the biggest issue is that the Holocaust is the only well-known genocide, and even with that, many people are not well-educated about it. I almost never hear anyone talk about the Rwandan genocide, the genocide of natives in various New World nations, or the current genocide in Xinjiang. </p>
<p>I've heard talk about how it is sacrilege to compare the Holocaust to anything else, and how it is unique due to the systemic nature of it where undesirables were rounded up so efficiently and slaughtered wholesale. </p>
<p>I would say that is all the more reason to discuss what is occurring now - should there be a genocide in the US, the capacity for harm will make any other genocide look like child's play. Our military, government, and large corporations could permit mass death at a scale unseen in human history. </p>
<p>This is all so unsettling.</p>

<p>And again, we see this <em>exact same setup</em> being set up with the Two Minutes' Hate against "anti-vaxxers murdering granny" bullshit the Branch Covidians love so damn much.</p>
<p>If you truly, genuinely believed that said group was responsible for such atrocities like slaughtering little old ladies with their unmuzzled faces/unvaxxed selves, it becomes acceptable to do <em>literally anything</em> to them. Or at the very least, demand big daddy government find a "solution" to them.</p>

        <p>As someone born in an oppressive Muslim country, I support the forced hijab argument. </p>
<p>I was harassed by people in the streets if my hair showed. They had “moral police” who would keep an eye out for stuff like that, literally the Karen hall monitors of the Middle East. </p>
<p>In addition, the hijab was framed as a way to protect society in general, not you specifically. They knew rape happened all the time. Hijabs and burkas and niqabs don’t stop men from assaulting you.  But if society accepted women showing themselves beyond the eyes, well we know men are animals and wouldn’t be able to handle it. They’d become <em>openly</em> sex crazed. </p>
<p>And yes separation of men and women in public is like social distancing. We couldn’t be trusted to not sleep with/ rape everyone we saw so we better stay apart to avoid sinful temptation. That just drive men to molest and rape little boys because thy ey had constant access and nobody cared.</p>
<p>And I should add my family was not Muslim. We were forced into their clothing but they knew we didn’t believe in it and they restricted us from owning a business or going to university, even denied medical care based on our religion underneath the facade of a hijab.</p>

        <p>That's an interesting perspective, and one I've heard before from my Middle Eastern friends. </p>
<p>You made some excellent points that I had never thought of before, though. The flawed idea of compulsory hijab as a means to stop the spread of sexual violence at a societal level definitely seems to be a parallel to the masks, which evidently do not do a very good job at stopping the spread of COVID given that we have had ridiculous numbers since the beginning of the pandemic even in areas where mask use is done by all.</p>
<p>When I had made my post, I was referring to voluntary hijab-wearing. Many of the Muslim women (in the US, as a disclaimer) I've known seem to want to wear it, and would feel naked without it. </p>
<p>To them, it is an essential component of their being - they would never leave the house without it. They make the decision to wear it, though. Just like we would not walk outside with no clothing with our genitals exposed, these women would not walk outside without their hair covered by a hijab. </p>
<p>While I personally think wearing a hijab is not an idea with any merit (based off of studying Islam and hearing about the reasoning for wearing it,) I respect their choice. I don't have to agree with them to believe that they should be able to do what they need to do to feel comfortable. </p>
<p>It is the same with the masks - I don't care if an octogenarian wishes to mask up out of an abundance of caution. That is their choice. If it makes them feel comfortable, they can do it, even if I don't personally agree with it or feel it is necessary. </p>
<p>But referring back to what you said - in a Muslim majority country, the hijab is not a choice. It is compulsory to participate in society. The women do not always wish to wear one, and their wishes are irrelevant. They must wear one or face rather brutal punishment.</p>
<p>We are getting to that point here - you wear the mask, whether or not you want to, or you face the wrath of the majority group.</p>
<p>I want America to be a place where you have a choice. Be it wearing (or not wearing) a hijab, a mask, or anything else, this country should afford us all the ability to live our lives in the way we see fit. We should never be forced into living or acting contrary to our deeply-held beliefs. </p>
<p>Thank you for the insight.</p>

        <p>I so appreciate your perspective on this! I've considered the mask/hijab similarity but have hesitated to share my thoughts with people because I'm not Muslim (nor have I lived in a Muslim country, like you have) and so didn't want to come across wrong.</p>

        <p>Make sure to have the ability to grow your own food as well. There are many aspects to self-sufficiency, and while firearms are important, they won't do much when you don't have other necessities. </p>
<p>I strongly believe that the method of converting or getting rid of the undesirables this time around will not be through direct force. It will likely be done in a war of attrition, where the powers that be engage in a long siege against the out-group. If those in power cut off the out-group's ability to buy or sell and obtain essentials, they will not last long.</p>
<p>If they institute a vaccine passport and all major corporations adopt it (and individuals are afraid of the penalties of trading with us,) the vast majority of us are dead in a month or two if we are adamant about our values and beliefs and don't acquiesce. </p>
<p>We must all possess the means of survival - shelter, arable land and the ability to grow healthy food in perpetuity (no GMO seeds that have been made sterile after the first harvest,) potable water, the ability to defend ourselves, and a small community to assist us in our times of need. </p>
<p>Without these things, none of us can be truly free. To fight the Beast, we must first be able to resist it, which cannot be done if the Beast has control over the most basic aspects of survival.</p>

        <p>My house is in the city and this neighbourhood has a bad enough problem with break ins before a food shortage. Id sell or abandon my house and take my guns/welding equipment to a reserve or automomous community. I dont have the means of surviving by myself. Im 26, wasnt raised by parents who value those skills. Hunting is going to the grocery store for them if you know what i mean. I have a lot to learn in what feels like a short period of time but i do have places i can go if i dont meet those goals before shtf</p>

        <p>I'm in a similar boat to you, but a little bit younger, and I live in a rather high crime rural area. So I definitely feel you there. It feels like I'm playing catch-up in regards to self-sufficiency, but at this point all trends point to any major issues being a couple of years away. We have time to learn how to survive.</p>
<p>The reserve/autonomous community idea is a good one. I'm looking into that as well, and have some plans there. </p>

        <p>I have been thinking about these things a lot since the beginning of this and am also disturbed by it.</p>
<p>For me personally, I have never really been the target of so much hatred from people who don't even know me.  It's a weird feeling especially since I can't personally relate to having that feeling towards any particular group as I can generally see things from both sides.</p>

        <p>I would agree. Any commentary that is not in accordance with the mainstream narrative is bombarded by threats and vitriol. </p>
<p>Like you, I have never seen such outright hatred and anger towards anyone who questions what is going on. I have received every manner of derogatory comment and (in some cases thinly-veiled threats) since I started posting about the New Normal and why it is wrong.</p>
<p>Personally, they don't really make me feel bad, but the fact that people are OK with doing it is quite alarming. I'm not new to the internet and the bad behavior anonymity brings, but it seems much worse than it used to be.</p>
<p>One of the first comments on this post (it has since been deleted) was someone claiming that my argument was invalid because I called people in favor of pandemic measures "sheep" and "demon-rats." They claimed that I specifically engaged in dehumanization of others myself, which is flat-out not true.</p>
<p>When I pressed him for the quote of where I said that, he claimed that it wasn't me personally that had said it, but others here had, and therefore I must feel the same way. </p>
<p>I called him out on that. This guy knows literally zero about me. He knows nothing about who I am, what my political affiliation is, what my life experiences have been, what my beliefs and values are, yet he automatically views me as a bumbling and hypocrital caricature of a far-right extremist (and oh boy, he missed the mark there) who could not possibly be making a legitimate point. </p>
<p>I'm seeing this so much nowadays - every post I make, people assign beliefs and intentions to me that are often laughably incorrect. Nobody can see anyone else as a human being with complex beliefs. We are all black or white, right or left, right or wrong, good or evil, etc. </p>
<p>Belief in this false dichotomy appears to be causing people to resort to straw man and ad hominem attacks whenever confronted with an argument they disagree with but don't really know how to dissect and criticize on merit. </p>
<p>The argument challenges their beliefs and they don't want to believe what it says, but they can't really come up with a good reason as to why their prior beliefs are right. The cognitive dissonance must be reconciled, and their psyche will not permit itself to be wrong.</p>
<p>Therefore, they must attack the character of the author of the argument - and that is why you get hit with the nasty names. They believe the argument must be wrong because it challenges their beliefs, and our minds are rather sensitive and don't like when that happens. </p>
<p>However, since their mind "knows" the argument is wrong but cannot explain why it is wrong, the author must be a bad person, and his beliefs (that led to him forming the argument) must be bad as well. Since we all view ourselves as good people on the right side of any situation, anyone who holds an opposing view to us must be bad people on the wrong side.</p>
<p>Once someone has reached this point of the thought process, there is no more need to attack an argument based on merit. They "know" deep down that the argument is wrong. </p>
<p>Therefore, the author is wrong as well, and since they now have some "proof" of that (the "proof" is that the author's views are opposed to their own and therefore bad) they feel that name-calling is a legitimate criticism of an argument. </p>
<p>I don't know if the level of hate is due to propaganda caricaturizing everyone and giving us a false perception of others, or if it is simply a byproduct of the nature of anonymous social media.</p>
<p>Either way, it is quite disturbing, and something we should all be keeping an eye on and calling out.</p>

        <p>This is an incredible post and you are precisely correct. And the fact that our system is pushing this kind of division and dehumanization is proof they don't care about our well-being, health, lives, or safety at all.</p>
<p>This kind of dehumanization is dangerous. It gets people killed. But it's also profitable and politically very powerful and that's why they do it.</p>
<p>With enough fear you can make people believe anything, and with enough politicization they will continue the agenda even after they aren't scared anymore, and even after they realize it's  based on lies.</p>

        <p>Agreed 100%. Also near the end, when you say that when we are at the point of 90% Americans vaccinated, even if they don’t just all out kill the last 10%, I think a much more likely scenario is them (us) being rounded up and put into education camps. “We need to teach these subhuman low IQ people why we all need to vaccinate, they will never learn on their own. It’s required we do this” will be the mainstream opinion. Great write up. Been thinking about this a lot lately. Just wanna go to the woods man</p>

        <p>Going to the woods would be the dream. </p>
<p>And yes, camps are likely at some point. I've heard numerous people on social media calling for exactly that. We need "containment facilities" for the "unclean," or something along those lines. It's only a matter of time before that opinion gets represented in more mainstream settings.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that the last 10% will be dominated by a war of attrition as opposed to outright conflict, though. I don't feel that the powers that be will enact another Nazi-style Holocaust. It's not practical, it leads to too many issues, and is just overall unnecessary. </p>
<p>They could kill just as many members of the out-group (if not more) by doing a couple of things:</p>
<p>First, mandate a vaccine passport or something similar that denotes in-group membership. Then, make it necessary to have one to access essentials such as food, shelter, or medical care.</p>
<p>Second, cut off the water and electricity to the residences of anyone who cannot prove in-group membership. </p>
<p>Lastly, make it a crime for in-group members to provide out-group members with any of those things. This could be enforced easily by getting rid of physical currency and replacing it with a government-controlled electronic method of payment, like what we have recently seen the Chinese government introduce. If anyone acted against the in-group, they will have their ability to buy or sell revoked.</p>
<p>We are seeing the progression towards this in the US currently, although we are a good ways behind China. </p>
<p>We are witnessing the widespread public adoption of blockchain-based cryptocurrency, the removal of massive amounts of physical money from circulation (remember the coin shortage of 2020?), and a move towards payment that does not require touch. </p>
<p>These trends will all continue in the coming years, and will pave the way for the final "Mark of the Beast" in the form of something that cannot be forged, will identify you as a member of the in-group, and will permit you to engage in trade.</p>
<p>If the powers that be want to liquidate the out-group and did these things, the out-group would be annihilated within months, with no need to build Auschwitz or Xinjiang-style camps. Precious few would have the ability to escape to a remote location and continue surviving.</p>
<p>Many people in the US are ignorant of just how much of a blessing essentials such as clean water, electricity, and sufficient food are. The vast majority of us are not prepared to live in a world where we would not have ready access to those necessities. </p>
<p>The time is now to get started on going to the woods, though. If you can buy property, do it, and get it operational and become self-sufficient before any of this trouble comes knocking at your door. Worst case scenario, you have a vacation home to escape to when you're feeling down.</p>

        <p>This is just so well-written and I hope it's not the last piece we see from you here or in general. </p>
<p>They mock the genocide comparisons by saying that a mask is not the holocaust - which is obviously very true, but not the point anyone including yourself is trying to make. </p>
<p>It's that you don't go from zero to genocide overnight - there are many steps involved and they've been repeated many times before. Enough that we should know enough not to do so this time as well. </p>
<p>But what people aren't understanding is this isn't the endgame yet, far from it. We have to gradually get to the point where such drastic actions would not only be tolerable but also desirable. We're not comparing ourselves to those who have suffered horrible deaths in the past - we're saying that society at the moment is leading us that way again though.</p>
<p>You don't go to bed a normal person one day and cheering on the extermination of an entire group the next, it would be unthinkable. 
But if over time the steps that you've outlined, that have been taken many times before are taken again - the same results will apply. </p>
<p>But people don't want to see it that way or don't have the emotional or intellectual capacity to do so. </p>
<p>They've been raised on simplistic superhero movies of good vs evil where the only thing stopping the world from being perfect is the existence of evil forces. There's no longer room for nuance or civil discussion. You are either this or that. Entirely good or entirely bad. You can't be a little bit of both.</p>
<p>The funny thing is too, I was going to make a post the other day that although I make fun of doomers - and I do mean a lot - I still do not wish death on them no matter what horrible things they post about us.</p>
<p>One thing the other side love to do is find instances where someone didn't believe in covid and get it anyways and die and they laugh at them; someone like Herman Cain. </p>
<p>I on the other hand, see the posts where someone who loved to mock "anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorists" dies after being vaccinated - and I don't find that funny, or uplifting or anything but heartbreaking... as they really believed they were doing the best thing for their health and others at the time. I don't cheer on anyone's death. It's not normal to. If the new normal is behaving like an absolute sociopath in order to fit in, then I will happily count myself out. </p>
<p>But as long as people like you exist, who can speak so eloquently to what we believe and articulate it so immaculately, there is hope. </p>
<p>Because there has to be people on the other side who may cheer along with the crowd, but secretly feel uncomfortable with it. And posts like yours are the ones that really make people realize that fact.</p>

        <p>We're already there (something awful). I usually hate Nazi comparisons but the current situation is accurate. Almost a decade before the "Final Solution", the Nazis had been running concentration camps within Germany and Austria. The morning after the Reichstag burned, a huge list of people- who had done nothing more than disagree with them- were arrested and sent to prison. Most never got out. In the beginning, it was about crushing ideas and dissent, and all about making Germany better and keeping "real Germans safe". The language used is shockingly similar. And again...all this is in the early 1930s...no where near the Shoah.  Also...just for the record...the idiots that compare masks to wearing a shirt and shoes...no one breathes out of their boobs. It's a ridiculous comparison.</p>

        <p>Interesting, but there are few points I would like to make. First, as for symbolisation, vaccinated people still have to wear a mask. One of the big things this sub is complaining about for no reason. Dehumanisation - literally who says that? And if they do, are you sure they weren't just joking? Where tf have you been looking if you find people wanting to exterminate anti maskers. In fact, alot of your points are not things that happen. Nobody is telling kids to hate your "out group" also, it's dying down. Covid is ending because people have been vaccinated. If people without the vaccine slowly get discriminated to the point of extermination, I will drink bleach. Also, there is literally no reason. It wouldn't be for race or anything, vaccinated people come in all ages genders and skin tones. Religious people get it as well. The only real reason would be to make the entire population vaccinated. In that case, they could just force people to get the vaccine instead of risking being caught killing people. And finally, who is orchestrating this whole thing? America itself? If it's anywhere at all, it would be all over the world. The UN? Same problem. No group of people that could be doing this covers all countries with covid and the supposed genocide. Explain this.</p>

        <p>1/2 </p>
<p>Thank you for your criticism. You brought up a few counterpoints I had been thinking of after I published my post. </p>
<p>Vaccinated people do not have to wear a mask. Per the CDC, they are safe should they choose to forgo it. Many workplaces now allow workers to remove the mask should they provide proof of vaccination to HR. My workplace has this policy, and the only people left wearing masks are those who have not been vaccinated. </p>
<p>I have seen quite a few anecdotal posts on here about people in the same situation, where they are being ostracized at work as the only person still required to mask up. </p>
<p>Will some vaccinated people continue to indulge their neuroses, and wear one? Sure, for now. Long term, though, the vast majority are going to want to return to normal and they will be taking the mask off. </p>
<p>They may not be initially comfortable doing so, but once they know that the in-group makes up the majority at their workplace, most of them will remove the mask. </p>
<p>In terms of hate - I see the hate on literally every major subreddit here. Spend some time on whitepeopletwitter, politicalhumor, or any of the other major ones that constantly post things about how evil folks against COVID measures are. </p>
<p>Read the comments - you will often see dehumanizing statements and attacks against folks like me. </p>
<p>"Plague rat," "disease vector," etc. are all thrown around frequently. Posters gloat about how superior they are for adhering to pandemic measures, and claim that people like me are terrible for simply wanting to live our lives. </p>
<p>I know that my anecdotes don't mean much, though, and you probably want some proof. So I will leave some examples. </p>
<p>Here is a post from r/adviceanimals with 38k upvotes calling for the imprisonment and forced labor of "plague rats." </p>
<p>While some of the comments may echo what I am saying about how dehumanization is bad, you must remember that enough people upvoted it to halfway fill up a professional sports venue. There is a quite decent level of support for what was said in the post. </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/it6e9q/but_muh_rights_says_the_plague_rat/ </p>
<p>Here is one from r/politicalhumor with over 100 upvotes calling Republicans "the party of plague rats," with several comments saying that Republicans and those in opposition to pandemic measures should be exterminated. </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/j4fl4s/the_party_of_plague_rats/ </p>
<p>Here is one from the Edmonton sub (with over 120k members, and over 500 upvotes on the post) calling people that do not adhere to pandemic measures plague rats. </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/j68df6/dont_be_a_plague_rat/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGrtH0g9vwAhUvh-AKHXnjAG0QFjAAegQIBBAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw316uizMnYkIfo1RJrWkJ16 </p>
<p>Here is another one from the Edmonton sub with roughly 270 upvotes calling for fines and legal action against those not following pandemic measures and specifically using the term plague rats to describe them. </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/kp7e4u/plaguerats_hope_they_get_fined/ </p>
<p>Here is one from r/therightcantmeme (a sub with nearly 350k members) with over 1.1k upvotes that specifically refers to conservatives and those against pandemic measures as plague rats. </p>

<p>Here is one from r/vent with 40 upvotes, not as many as the others, but I included it because I felt that it was quite a clear example of the type of behavior I am referring to. </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/j52s2s/i_hate_president_plague_rat_and_antimaskers/ </p>
<p>Here is one from r/fsu (a sub with 17k members) with nearly 170 upvotes calling college students partying plague rats. </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/fsu/comments/lvnsxw/pots_patrons_being_plague_rats/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwigiMTlh9vwAhX9SzABHd5QAdQ4ChAWMAV6BAgFEAI&amp;usg=AOvVaw35xScP9uSLeBhtqzWMTim5 </p>
<p>This were the first ones that came up in a 5 minute google search. I have seen a ton more. </p>
<p>And I suppose the dehumanization could just be a "joke" as you put it. Sure. That excuse sounds just like the tired claim that 4chan posts comparing minorities to insects and vermin and calling for their extermination are "ironic." </p>
<p>And perhaps not many people are directly saying, "children, people who don't wear masks or get vaccinated are evil." </p>
<p>It's just, "hey little Johnny, you can't play with that other little boy. He isn't wearing a mask, and you could get sick from him and die. You could also get sick from him and it might kill grandma who lives at home with us. You don't want to kill gram-grams, do you?" </p>
<p>It's just, "your friend can't come to your birthday party. He also won't be coming back to school, and he is not allowed to play on your sports team anymore. His parents don't believe in vaccination. He's too dangerous to have around other people." </p>
<p>Do you seriously believe that constantly teaching young children that mask use or experimental vaccination is necessary to be a part of society, or drilling it into their head that anywhere they go they are putting themselves at nearly guaranteed risk of catching a deadly disease is not going to engender negative feelings towards those who do not live in that state of paranoia? </p>
<p>With regards to your point about "why would they discriminate to the point of extermination?" It is very simple. Those who refuse to follow pandemic measures are the same ones who rebel against the powerful and will cause problems in the future. </p>
<p>The government has historically had no problem crushing whites, (see the civil war, and although I am not condoning slavery or saying that the Confederacy was morally equivalent to civil rights causes, I don't believe that anyone could argue that the white southerners did not rebel against the federal gov't,) blacks (see the history of pretty much every pro-black or pro-civil rights group,) or natives (see the history of the natives since the first Europeans came to what is now the US) that rebel against authority.</p>

        <p>Personally I still disagree, for example your saying that people think that the the anti vaccers are "killing grandma" when pretty much nobody is saying stuff like that, and that the people talking about plague rats are just general assholes and the loudest minority. Most people are like "what an idiot" and give them a wide berth. But I have to give credit that you didn't just immediately downvote me and you stayed civil, unlike most arguments that take place on this sub. So thanks.</p>

It makes sense to me now why Obama ordered 30,000. guillotines during his term and are held in two different states in our country right now.</p>

        <p>I have often thought that the same people who call for other people's deaths have never killed anything, never been hunting and never actually witnessed another persons death. It's all an abstract concept but there are actually people in this world that are eager and willing to turn that vision into reality.</p>

        <p>This generalization and preconception of the beliefs of others is exactly what I am concerned about. </p>
<p>It would probably blow your mind to know that I am not a Republican. I would describe myself as a "communist" if anything, although that is a bit of a loaded term and I eschew it for that reason.</p>
<p>If you disagree with the points of my arguments, I have no issue with that. I don't expect that everyone would support them. There is legitimate debate to be had there.</p>
<p>But don't assign morality or intention to people that you don't or can't know. It is hard for any of us to avoid doing that, but we must not do it.</p>
<p>Everyone is being made to believe that those that disagree with them are nonsensical caricatures instead of real human beings with nuanced beliefs.</p>
<p>This is bad, and we must all be careful to avoid that trap.</p>

        <p>What's wrong with sheep? They follow their shepherd to the slaughter. That's exactly what millions are doing by not questioning a never before used vaccine quickly developed and in clinical trials. I don't see sheep as derogatory. Also many of my family and coworkers got the vaccine and even told me they had no clue what's in it they just don't want to wear the mask anymore. I still call them sheep.</p>

        <p>I guess it would be a matter of context. I never call a person a sheep to their face. I think it in my head. I am Jewish and I know people call me a kike or whatever derogatory term. I'm starting to see the same things my grandparents saw in communist Russia when the Nazi's were invading. This terrifies me. So no I'm not afraid of a derogatory slur I'm more afraid of idiots rounding me up and tossing me into a camp because I didn't want the vaccine. Which should be my own personal choice.</p>
