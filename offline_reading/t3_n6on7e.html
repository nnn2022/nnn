    <strong>Let's not become hypocrites</strong>
    <p><p>I'm completely anti-covid vaccine and anti-lockdown like most who visit this sub are. But I see a lot of anecdotal evidence and screenshots of article pieces which we would shun as misinformation or propaganda if it were written from the opposing side. We upvote headlines stating that more people have died from the vaccine than from covid, or statistics showing that states which eased their lockdowns actually have fewer cases than those who remain in lockdown. We use these as examples to point and say, "See! The lockdowns aren't working and the vaccines are unsafe!" Yet if the articles had said the opposite, we would shun it as fake news.</p>
<p>We enjoy mocking the media for trying to paint Bill Gates as the face of the vaccine despite him not being a doctor. But we frequently reject the opinions of real doctors by claiming they are simply shilling for the government and we only listen to the doctors who go against the grain and validate our own covid beliefs. So what difference would it make if Bill Gates actually was a doctor if we wouldn't believe him anyway?</p>
<p>Cherry-picking our news reports and which doctors we want to believe makes us no different than those who are fully invested in this "pandemic". This sub believes they are on the correct side - but so do they.</p>
<p>The best way to prove your point is by showing everyone how the world is actually going by turning off your screens and just taking a walk outside. You will very quickly sees how normal everything has always been if it wasn't for the fear-porn telling everyone to be scared of the Boogeyman.</p>
<p>I know this won't change much as this sub is one of the few that feels like a safe-haven from all the mainstream bullshit, but I can't take most of it seriously when it just feels like the other side of the same coin with how it promotes its message.</p></p>

        <p>Both sides can point to studies that support their claims. Yes there's a lot of anecdotal evidence and yes, we're all guilty of confirmation bias to some degree but when the other side wishes death on us, wants to keep the world in shackles if only to give a few more months of life to the elderly, believes that there is no freedom too big or small to sacrifice...I'm sorry if this sounds like some cliché'd statement but if you're not on the side of freedom then you're just wrong, end of story.</p>

        <p>Thank you. It’s important for me to keep the intellectual high ground, otherwise I’m just the bizarro version of one of the doomers.</p>

        <p>Except this is one of the ONLY places online that we’re allowed to post anything counter-narrative. People need to fact check but I don’t think we need to not cherry pick, honestly. The rest of the entire internet is already showing us everything else, most of us come here to see the opposite side. Just my opinion.</p>
