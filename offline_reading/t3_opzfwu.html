    <strong>Would you have chosen the vax if Covid19 was really lethal?</strong>
    <p><p>I think most of us are rejecting it simply because of the 98.85% survival rate. That we don't see the benefits of taking an unproven vaccine just to prevent/reduce the chance of infection.</p>
<p>But what if Covid19 has a 50% or less survival rate, maybe as contagious as Covid19 we see now but as lethal as Malaria? Would you have no choice but to take the vaccine?</p>
<p>Me thinks covid19 is a test run, to collect data on the transmission abilities of Corona virus, but at the same time observe how well the society will react with the pandemic. Once Covid19 settle down, it is highly possible we will see another contagious but more lethal virus showing up. Maybe that is the big game folks are setting up for.</p>
<p>So if Covid19 was lethal, would you still choose to live/die without the vaccine? This is a question we should start thinking, because in few more years, we will have to make such decisions. Or will you just opt for a fullbody Hazmat suit?</p></p>

        <p>Looking at one detail of the picture I believe misses a greater point of how different "leaders" (and media) would have acted were the virus as deadly as your hypothetical example.</p>
<p>Of course people would be participating in far greater numbers in a situation where survival was 50% or under... and those running things would have done far more to prevent the virus from reaching borders- not out of any concern for us, but for themselves and people they actually DO care about.</p>
<p>The picture, process, and track record of government actions would have been MUCH different if the virus were truly deadly to a broad-based, otherwise healthy population.</p>

        <p>what if the vaccine works, but with side effects, leaders would just do what they are doing pushing for a vaccine mandate, vaccine companies will profit from this and leaders can pocket huge amount of money in. and there are other potential uses for the vaccine when everyone agrees to take it. one example (very unlikely) would be using it as a trojan horse, or those crazy theory about putting nanochips in peoples body (they can just do it on your food &amp; drinks).</p>
<p>the key is getting everyone hooked onto the vaccine. a more lethal virus merely means better chance at reaching their goals (of course more people will initially die).</p>

        <p>can be one or many. obvious one is get everyone on earth to buy their vaccine. other potential uses maybe get everyone to be injected with a trojan horse that allows future virus to infect, which then require more vaccines. or like some joker said they could inject you with microchip to mind control the population. or they just want to depopulate the world by making you infertile. or they have some crooked idea that they want everyone to get injected with some of their urine to fulfill some of their desire to dominate.</p>

        <p>I think if something has a 50% survival rate it would play out much differently. For one, if we were actually able to get a vaccine, you would know very quickly if it worked. Also, everything that has occurred over the past year and a half would go very differently. You really would see people dying, people would actually not leave their homes, hospitals would cease to run, police, fire, EMTs, etc. would not report to work. Schools would never reopen, grocery stores would not have workers, and small businesses would not be opened because the owner decided to close and not told to by the government. Society would probably actually collapse rather than this slow burn of disruption we are seeing.</p>

        <p>Thank you for saying it. Yeah I’m not cowering in fear over diseases with 50% mortality, either. Those already exist and I don’t stop for them. The rest of the population doesn’t either, but maybe that’s only because they’re not told to.</p>

        <p>what if, it was lethal, but takes longer period to see the symptoms.</p>
<p>i believe the future virus will be as contagious as Covid19, but will have longer incubation period, but far more severe symptoms pass the period where we reach a point of no return.</p>
<p>what if the vaccine works on reducing the infection rate, but at the same time causes side effects and maybe unforeseeable long term problems? we won't know because we will be pressured to take the vaccine for such dangerous virus. it's pretty much a do and die dont do you might still die scenario, but at least you survived the pandemic, so we can work on the side effects later.</p>

        <p>If covid was actually highly lethal to young and healthy people, I probably would have gotten the vaccine when it first was available to me. Although I’d end up regretting it by now since people are still getting the virus anyway and it seems like the vax is worthless.</p>

        <p>When that ebola pandemic occurred in Liberia in 2014, there were people getting sick and dying even with full on hazmat suits, nevermind masks. Oh, and the vaccine for ebola was made available in December 2019. Given this information, I don't think you'd even be alive to make that decision.</p>

        <p>Probably yeah.</p>
<p>For me it would have to balance out the health risk of taking the vaccine with the efficacy data and how lethal the virus was.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If this was a legit pandemic and the vaccine was also legit I would have taken it for sure.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I have health issues that should make me exempt, working on seeing a specialist about that now, so if the vaccine was still sketchy I would still have waited it out, unless the virus was actually that scary then I'd have taken the risk.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You might be right, there may be a big bad scary new virus on the way after Covid. We did just see Gates and Soros buy up that testing company here in the UK which is suspicious AF.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But because of Covid 19 and the way everything has been handled there will be no way in hell that I will take a vaccine for another virus. It could just look like it's worse because of everyone taking the Vaxx this time around and getting super ill. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So yeah, maybe in another timeline.</p>

        <p>but what if Covid19 was lethal, but the vaccine isn't really that effective and it actually has more side effects than benefits, but you won't know until it's too late, either you get covid and get really sick or died before you know whether a vaccine works or not, or whether it has severe reactions?</p>
<p>coz you know if a pandemic is really lethal, people will be pressured to take the vaccine, hey even if it's just saline water, folks will still kill for it.</p>
<p>so what would you do if you were really pressured by a really lethal virus and your only hope is a leap of faith that the vaccine works?</p>

<p>If there was no indication or evidence to say the vaccine wasn't effective or that it was dangerous then yeah, I'd have probably have jumped at the vaccine and been seriously dissapointed and mad with myself if it did have effects. </p>

        <p>What if the vaccine is similar to the ones we have now except it has a high efficacy? Would you take it even though it has potential side effects and still not fully understood or proven safe?</p>
<p>For me? Hard to say. Either die of the plague now and not worry later, or take the unknown vaccine that works and survive, and worry about the side effects later? But i believe majority people will choose to take it for the basic human instinct of survival.</p>

        <p>Well according to the gene therapy specialist Dr. Ulm who raised concern about unintended long term systemic effects, he said it could take weeks to months.</p>
<p>It’s impatient to note that Dr. Ulm was discussing this in the rapid response section of the British Medical Journal, which is liken to the comments section of journal publications. He was not and is not against the vaccine (or so it seems from what he said) but he did raise the question of mrna breaching blood brain barrier and what that could entail.</p>
<p>My sister has done a lot more research into this because she is straight anti vax no matter what, which I totally disagree with, but from what she’s read and watched, the timeframe is 7 months.</p>
<p>If this is true, we should see it manifesting around now.
If it does manifest, we need enough numbers to show up proving correlation.</p>
<p>If suddenly all these people turn up with immune system disorders, the incidence rate would be significantly greater than pre covid levels and the common denominator would be mrna vaccine.</p>
<p>I just don’t know how much higher that incidence rate would need to be before hospitals sound the alarm. It would be a global trend.
If a given immune system disorder is 1/1000 pre covid and then post vaccine it’s 2/1000, thats 100% increase but is it enough for doctors to pull the handbrake? I don’t know</p>

        <p>novavax uses similar technology as sinovac/sinopharm which will never be approved in the states because they are from China.</p>
<p>it uses inactivated virus as a vector to trigger the immune system. old technology. still, there are risks you can get infected.</p>
<p>novavax claims it has high efficacy and low side effects, however sinovac has been reported to be inefficient, and antibodies have been found to drop after few months, and many countries do not see sinovac as a proper vaccine. hopefully novavax will overcome this political hurdle.</p>

        <p>It's an excellent question.  You'd still want as much safety data as possible but I think my thinking would change.  Most people would be on the same page with only a small percentage of the population being against but this would truly be a unique set of circumstances with the lethality rate being the overriding factor..  With the reality we have on the ground now the intensity and downright coercive nature of the current vaccination campaign comes across as bizarre. It's an overstatement to call it a life and death situation in most cases.</p>

        <p>50% odds make it seem like a better bet but seeing as we know the vaccines only reduce one or more symptoms I don’t see how it would make your chances significantly better.</p>

        <p>It would depend on the safety profile of the vaccine. How long was it in R&amp;D? A vaxx made in two months, without adequate testing will cause problems. </p>
<p>Any medical decision should be a personal one, and not one that's used to cause societal division. This whole thing is absolutely bonkers.</p>

        <p>If you only have few weeks to decide before a deadly virus overwhelms the society would you still wait for safety data on a vaccine that is less than 2 years old but effective (but comes with potential side effects).</p>
<p>Take it now and stay alive and worry bout side effects later? Or die of the virus that has proven its lethality now?</p>

        <p>Sure, if Covid were truly as deadly as the media purported to be, and I were at risk as someone under 30, and I felt like the vaccine was safe, I would happily take it. I don’t have a problem with vaccines. I have a problem with getting a vaccine for a disease I probably already had, that I am not at risk for, and that has troubling side effects. If I were seriously at risk for it and hadn’t had it already, and the side effects/symptoms/risk of Covid were significantly greater than potential side effects of the vaccine, I would happily get it.</p>

        <p>Even if the case fatality rate went up to 5%, or 10%, we would notice. There would be no one who doesn't know someone who died from COVID. Also, the symptoms for the very sick would have to more severe and scary to cause death. As it is, the symptoms for healthy people who are under 70 seem to be exactly the same as colds we have been not worrying about for our entire lives. The 'pandemic' is a lie. It became obvious when the reports started coming out showing minimal excess deaths, and tons of research into how lockdowns (called 'external' effects of the pandemic LMAO) are killing young people.</p>
