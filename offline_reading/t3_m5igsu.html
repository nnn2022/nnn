        <p>All 75 million people who voted for Trump have the exact same political feelings as the worst person we can find.   Therefore, they arent humans.</p>
<p>This is a nutshell of whats been told in r/politics (and all of CNN and MSNBC) for the last 4 years.  Its no different than the mid 30s in Germany.   Train the children that their enemy isnt human and you can convince them to do anything.  It doesnt really take a whole lot.  Look at the Stamford prison experiments.</p>

        <p>Wow, you're right. </p>
<p>&rt;Stage 4: organization - An example of this is the Kristallnacht. The German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels called for revenge on the murder of a German ambassador employee in Paris by a Jewish German refugee. After this call of vengeance a mass mob violence broke out. The German policy and military did not intervene and the results of the mob violence was a burning of many synagogues, destruction and looting of jewish stores</p>
<p>I know of a Jewish professor who compared the riots of last summer to the Kristallnacht. He was fired from one of his roles for saying that.</p>

        <p>I think that is an extreme oversimplification. Not to "both sides" this thing, but we have two issues happening right now with the general discourse of anything political in America and perhaps many places internationally. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Confirmation bias - there is literally no shortage of news outlets and studies you can find that will confirm your already deeply or mildly held beliefs further pushing you in a direction you were already headed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No nuanced discourse because of the "10 second soundbite headline" media.  Everyone is only reading headlines or listening to a 10 second clip of something because of 0 attention span and too much info to take in. As a result media has shifted to anything that gets them views and clicks. How much depth and discussion and info can one really gather at that point. All topics are thus over simplified and push people into extreme camps of thinking.</p>

        <p>Yes its a simplification.   I feel its also accurate.   You can find many subs fied with nothing but hate.  As long as you hate the right people, its the good and accepted hate.   When you normalize this over time you get people willing to commit atrocities.   There are movies showing interviews of old Germans who when interviewed in their 70s felt no remorse for their actions in their late teens and 20s simply because they never saw the targets of their hatred as humans.</p>
<p>And you can definitely "both sides" this.  One could run a simple test and post in left and right leaning subs (double bonus for r/politics or any coronavirus (+state abbv) sub) </p>

        <p>Read <em>They Thought They Were Free</em> by Milton Meyer.  IMO that book was scarier than anything by Stephen King.  Why?  Because it showed how ordinary Germans, even educated ones, went along with the program.  They didn't believe in it, quite a few thought it was ugly and distasteful.  But... people were working. Your job was reasonably secure - <em>if</em> you kept your head down and didn't complain about the Nazis.  (and of course, if you weren't gay or Jewish or Gypsy.)  Easy enough to go with the flow, don't make trouble.  As one professor said, "If, in 1933, the Nazis had said they were going to send all the Jews to camps and kill them, most of the country would have risen.  But it was all done in small, incremental steps. Once you went along with the beginnings, it became harder to stand up against the later outrages."  </p>
<p>The book scared me most when I thought of myself - would I have done any differently?</p>

        <p>Not directly but by establishing the premise that we've learned from history and in particular have become better as a species because we have absorbed all the lessons from the holocaust, for instance, it certainly suggests as much... just an opinion.</p>

        <p>I guess I'm still confused, how has this premise been established in your awareness. Like is is something you were told, something you read. Like this is not something I could consider a common notion.</p>

        <p>J*ws control the federal reserve, media, politics, many technocratic monopolies, financial institutions and big pharma. These groups accumulated nearly half of the world's dollar supply and brought up significant portions in almost all productive sectors of the economy (industrial firms were DESPERATE) in a little more than a year.
