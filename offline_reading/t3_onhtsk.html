    <p><p>Please tell me it's illegal for them to require me to be penetrated by a medical device weekly to maintain employment. I do not want to be tested weekly, especially when I am clearly not sick. In addition, I do not want to add to the false positive rates that they are going to use to perpetuate this tyranny and to sow more hatred towards people who refused the vaccine.</p>
<p>Our family absolutely needs this job and my health insurance, especially since my husband really doesn't want to move back to our home state to get help from our families with our newborn twins and toddler. </p>
<p>What are my options?</p></p>

Advice... but I’m just another person fed up w companies treating employees like they are patient zero.
Especially as we are seeing SO MANY cases of covid in fully vaccinated people. We need to keep reminding the world that this isn’t a disease that kills healthy people. Most healthy people under 70 get covid and come out fine.</p>
