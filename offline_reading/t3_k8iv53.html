        <p>Ventilators definitely cause more harm than good. Thats why the NY rates were so high at first because they were venting pretty much everyone who was hospitalized. </p>
<p>Then the media will say "Covid causes amputations!!!", when it was it fact the clots caused by being immobile while on a ventilator that caused those amputations. Not Covid</p>

<p>Critically ill patients are ritually placed on anti-coagulation (those bed bound)</p>
<p>Covid can and has hit the endothelium of the vasculature, resulting in weird scenarios like hypercoagulability and pro-thrombotic events.  Some patients have been on crazy heparin doses and they die because they clot everywhere.</p>
<p>Re: ventilators, agreed.  The respiratory distress needs to be treated like high altitude edema, or other lung protective strategies (IE HFNC or bipap).  Intubation is not a good idea.</p>

        <p>ok seriously, COVID is being implicated in every possible medical scenario. Abnormal coagulation happens under many different circumstances and also resulting from many different medications. </p>
<p>What's next, substance abuse and suicides are really caused by COVID attacking our brain chemistry, inhibiting and / or disrupting our ability to natural produce dopamine. </p>
<p>It takes years of studies to correlate cause and effect, but in 2020 they can suddenly with unquestionable accuracy and decisiveness connect COVID to numerous health conditions. This nonsense is growing far beyond the threshold of mere absurdity. </p>

        <p>lol..no confusion here..The only confusion is the precedence set in 2020. People who die from cancer who finally succumbed to organ failure, sepsis, pneumonia etc they are ruled Cancer deaths. They succumb to these conditions becasue there body is no longer capable of fighting off germs, bacteria, virus's or cell repair and regeneration. You hear in the news how 100's of thousands of people are suddenly dying from organ failures lol...they died from cancer. These "disorder's" are the same disorders that make your body more vulnerable to contracting pathogens. And just becasue someone has a virus in their system does not mean it had any influence on their death. </p>
<p>Your higher mortality rate, will be around .93%, the projected for 2020 was .88%, that's a total of .05% increase over projected. If you look at the trends we have been on a steady incline since 2013 as life expectancy continues to drop..interesting...Pre 2020 they were also identifying a significant trend of a disproportional number of younger people dying due to conditions of the heart, kidneys, overdoses etc, especially in the minority groups..2020, well before 2020 hit, was expected to carry a higher number of excess deaths than the past few decades..We are on the upswing and it was well known. </p>
<p>Do you have any comprehension of how many people would be ruled Flu deaths every year if they used the same policies they implemented this year...just for a second think about this...
How about we simply rule a death by the condition they died from, like every other year. Cancer, Heart disease, Kidney failure, liver failure, Old age, Accidents lol...seriously..it's ridiculous what is hapening.</p>

        <p>Well, they did have to deliberately infect nursing homes to really kick start the pandemic. you could have accomplished the same death tolls by placing Flu and pneumonia patients in with them..</p>
<p>However, what I am saying is they are exploiting something that was going to happen in 2020 despite COVID. There were a going to be a large number of excess deaths. It's that simple...Now they have every westernized nation under siege, implementing more and more control measures. How convenient....Even the so called model of China is a farce. All you have to do is research and find video's of cities other than "Wuhan" lol, and you can see that they were business as usual with many people wearing masks, but many people not, and virtually so crowded that people are shoulder to shoulder...seems like a superspreader event to me..All during the period of the COVID crisis lol.. How is it that other countries can enforce just as severe and even more severe measures for a greater period of time than China or any Asian country for that matter, ever did, but the westernized countries just keep getting pounded. 2 weeks, too soon, 4 weeks, too soon, 8 weeks still to soon..
Of course you have the anomalistic country like Sweden, which with no measures at all managed to do very well....that is until recently...another fascinating pattern with COVID..after it initially hit Sweden pushing them to the top of the charts, suddenly takes a vacation and waited another 6 months before showing up again...with no measures....lmao...it's too much</p>

        <p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>Consumption coagulopathies and hypercoagulability have been observed in some of these patients.  That’s a fact, and they’re diagnosed exclusively, as a multitude of causes exist.</p>
<p>I don’t care about overdiagnosing.  The fact is, it’s been observed in positive patients, that have had a spectrum of other symptoms.  That’s all I’m saying.</p>
<p>The fact someone gets hit by a truck and they diagnose it as a covid death doesn’t matter at all to me.  It doesn’t change the fact that this disease can act intravascularily, that was my point.  I don’t care about the other nonsense, which I agree is ludicrous.  It doesn’t change my point.</p>
<p>You don’t need gold standard data to find correlation using case studies.  I know it takes years, but that’s also irrelevant.  The clinical situation is the clinical situation.</p>

<p>No.  Thrombocytopenia and massive clots just don’t happen, like cancer does.  These clot issues are quirky things that, when systemic like in the cases observed, usually have a definitive cause.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no comparison between cancer and these physiologic cascades.  No one worth their salt in medicine would make that comparison.  I’m led to believe you may be in over your head with this one.</p>

        <p>Dude, I do this shit for a living.  There’s no distortion of rationalization.</p>
<p>In my above post, it’s spelled out that there’s a plethora of processes that can cause these issues.  One of which is generally infection.</p>
<p>The original rebuttal was someone posted that blood clots in these patients was caused by being sedentary.  That’s a false statement, due to every hospital in the country having protocols for dvt prophylaxis - that work.</p>
<p>The clots observed is likely from the disease process, because it just doesn’t happen.  And making it more difficult, the cause of clot probably isn’t the same either.  Is it a consumption coagulopathy, disruption in tpa, etc.</p>
<p>So the answer is yes, these conditions existed prior, but it’s proof of nothing.</p>
<p>It’s like seeing a forest fire and talking about the cause, when you’re just watching the fire from the TV.  It requires investigation.</p>

        <p>lol everyone claims to be an expert.</p>
<p>That's right....INVESTIGATION, which requires years of studies examining cause and effect, not just becasue you want to see a correlation based on a perception of pattern when this pattern existed long before COVID. 
Your analogy is silly. It's not the standing on the outside talking about the cause that's the problem, it's the so called experts at the scene just declaring a cause without the investigation, that's the real problem. </p>
<p>It is unscientific and utterly irresponsible to make these assumptions, becasue that's all they are, and instill further panic and fear. However that is the current scientific approach, to find ways to correlate every condition, that preceded COVID, to COVID. Patients who have and continue to die due to conditions that they would have succumb to and are being listed as COVID deaths...The numbers speak loud and clear and never in the history have they gone to such efforts to manipulate the system so that they can tie so many deaths to a virus...</p>
<p>If this is your level of critical thinking and you claim to be in the field, then you are doing the world a terrible injustice and are just as responsible as those calling the shots for the exponentially more deaths that are going to emerge as collateral damage from this bullshit pandemic.</p>

        <p>It’s hard to tell.  The variability is so extreme.  Some people won’t have any intravascular symptoms, in fact most won’t.  It’s just really hard to predict the course, which is what makes this thing so hard.</p>
<p>Ventilators yea.  As a last resort of course they would be used.  In our unit, this 17yo girl gets intubated also.  17!  Just to give her a chance.</p>

        <p>She's a sister to all of us, because we're all human. What the doctors did is at least manslaughter, if not premed murder. I don't care about her other issues, because frankly, I think she could have lived with them. I think that if the care for SARS-2 was more sane and measured, then she would have survived, and maybe been on a path to show us what gifts she could have brought to the world.</p>

        <p>My thoughts on all this supposed Covid death rate. 
You have a 6 shot revolver.<br>
You are shot 5x. 
The sixth shot is the what the hospital is going to count as your killer. Let alone you’ve been shot (other health problems ) 5x prior And already dead without knowing your date your dead. 
High blood pressure. 
Diabetes. 
Lung and Breathing issues. 
Overweight and obese. 
Heart attack and heart related issues. 
Then “covid” shows up and you die from complications-from their care and it’s a Covid death. Or you caught when you had to go to hospital for heart attack and then it’s counted as a covid death</p>

        <p>I miss Coca Cola in Germany. I loved going to Kaufland and getting the plastic crate with the smaller glass bottles. It might be a placebo-type thing but I always thought coke tastes better from a glass bottle than it does plastic.</p>
<p>Anyways, here in America coke is sweetened with high fructose corn syrup but it’s sweetened with actual sugar in Germany. And probably most other countries.</p>
<p>Ahhhh I’m just remembering my favorite meal from over there - schnitzel, mashed potatoes, salad, peas and carrots and fried cauliflower. With a nice, frosty cold bottle of coke.</p>
<p>Ok, I’m done reminiscing. Thank you for your time.</p>

        <p>I lived in Germany for four years. Real Coke in glass bottles is one of a super long list of things I miss.</p>
<p>It had a much sharper, less sweet taste than the processed crap we get here.</p>

        <p>We have Coke Zero too. Diet Coke is different - it's a lot less sweet than regular Coca Cola/Coke Zero. In Germany I think Diet Coke is called Coke Light? I forget.</p>

        <p>Yes. "Light" is from almost zero calories and less sweet taste.</p>
<p>People tend to confuse them (light and zero), that's why they think that cola zero and cola with sugar taste different.</p>

        <p>You basicaly can find any study proving anything in fitness/diet category. Why? Because most of them are crap and poor.</p>
<p>I know hundreds of people (incl myself) who use various sugar substitutes for whole life and they are fit, healthy and so one.</p>
<p>It's not with what you sweetens your food. It's about controlling calories intake and usage (sport ect). Period.</p>

        <p>Considered and dismissed due to the fact of 100's of 1000's of "cases" who didn't die because they were otherwise healthy and shrugged covid off, just like the common cold.<br>
What's your evidence that this thing is even a minor concern for anyone not already having a co-morbid condition?</p>

        <p>There is no evidence, but that’s also not the point. The point is not spreading it to those who do have existing conditions, so it doesn’t just make it so much worse for them, or - as this post shows - a catalyst for death. Try to think a little bit beyond yourself and those fortunate enough to have perfectly functioning bodies. Sure it passes through 20, 50, 100 people without anyone noticing, but then it gets to that 101st person and has the potential to kill them. It’s not fair to think this virus is pathetic and does nothing, only for a family to lose a child or a parent because others only think of their own high and mighty immune systems.</p>
<p>But that being said, idk why this means everyone has to lock themselves down. Sure there are perfectly healthy people who are made genuinely sick by Covid, but it’s so incredibly rare it doesn’t warrant the total shutdown America is experiencing (idk much about any other countries, haven’t looked into them, and my own has no cases anymore so we’ve just forgotten it exists). They really did go so overboard with the restrictions and such, and it’s kind of stupid to look at.</p>

        <p>Zero surprise that someone this obese died of heart complications.  It's hilarious that people think obesity alone won't kill a young person.  This person was a fringe outlier statistic killed by obesity, possibly with underlying heart condition that could be congenital or caused by the obesity itself.  The same as a healthy person who was actually killed by covid, would also be a fringe outlier statistic.  Obesity won't normally kill you in your teens, but it will kill some tiny fraction of a percent.</p>

        <p>The media and cdc doesn't seems to want to make this distinction. When an 85 year old with cancer dies and tests possitive for covid, they count that as a covid death. I think it was only 6% of covid deaths were FROM covid, not WITH covid.</p>

<p>also, look at this toxic ass community. look at the people commenting in your thread about her having a lifelong diet of cheeseburgers and diet coke. having an unhealthy diet isnt great, but mocking someone for dying over it (especially with covid) is not cool. </p>

        <p>On some level, yes I agree but we haven't been given the same courtesy by people who believe their covid health issues are more important than others. Where was media and general sympathy for me when I was on the verge of suicide? I had severe mental health issues before covid but it hit its peak when the pandemic began and got worse as the lockdowns continued. 
Where is the sympathy for business owners trying to make a living? A parent trying to provide for their family? Kids who rely on school lunches? People in tough situations who rely on school/work to get out of an abusive household?</p>

        <p>I have sympathy for all of those things. Respecting someone’s loss does not take away from the respect I have for the rest of the worlds struggles. Rather, practicing empathy begets more empathy. I’m not saying there aren’t things to be angry about. There are. And I’m angry with you. But it is not an excuse to make a joke out of the loss of a life.</p>

        <p>I think you're on the wrong sub then. This is to give people who don't normally get the courtesy and respect of others a voice (such as myself with mental illnesses). Just like you wouldn't go to an AA meeting and discuss your addiction for sweets. I do sympathize with the loss of this person but I also understand the nature of this sub. If we have to joke about it to get attention then we will. Obvs doomers/media don't take it seriously when we say people die from underlying causes with covid in a serious fashion.</p>

        <p>Hmm, I am interested in your point of view. I will unsubscribe, then. I genuinely thought this was a place to question the official narrative, which I’m all about. But if this many people are coming to defend their right to lash out in hateful ways it’s not what I thought. 
I also struggle with my mental health and come from an abusive family who made it so much worse. I’ll fight against bullies forever for that reason. I’m sorry you’ve felt disrespected and treated discourteously. Not everyone is a bully. Wish you the best. Truly.</p>

        <p>Thank you and thanks for civil discourse. I suppose any sub is up for your interpretation and I respect your opinions and perspectives, but to sum it up for you, you can also think of this sub as a support group for people who have suffered greatly as a result of the pandemic and lockdowns, etc. We aren't just challenging the narrative, we are also supporting one another to show each individual we are not crazy for thinking the way we do. While I respect your right to comment as you please, just know your comments may be viewed as invalidating people suffering from this newnormal bs. It's rather insensitive to stick up for a deceased person who is already garnering tons of support from media and doomers while people like us receive little to none. This is our support group. Hope that clears things up for you and I do hope you can stay with us to continue challenging the narrative. Feel free to dm me if needed. Take care.</p>

        <p>You thought this subreddit would be different?! I don’t think you’ll find a completely balanced sub that’s focused on a certain point of view. Every sub eventually devolves into a hive mind echo chamber that turns the pitchforks onto the individual who refuses to swallow the all-or-nothing narrative. I’m leaving, too, as the lunatics are claiming safe spaces so they can make fun of obese kids and excoriate the parents for bad parenting without being called out because boo hoo, “we don’t get no support from the media.” The media is the enemy, not the minor who’d had health problems, got Covid, and is now dead. Save the disrespect and insensitivity for the people who deserve them.</p>

        <p>Sadly, the parents are apparently guilty of child abuse. No child would get into such a condition without direct actions by the parents. So who actually is guilty for this? Sadly, the child probably developed diabetes and all the horrible complications that go along with it. To lock ALL of society down for the malevolence of bad parents does not seem to be proportional... or am I wrong??</p>

        <p>Well if you don't take care of yourself you are opening yourself up to the possibility of a early death via numerous health consequences. Nothing wrong with being a asshole. If her parents were assholes and harrassed her more often to go out for a walk them maybe she would actually be alive still.  </p>
<p>I'm just sick and tired of the stupid "it's ok to not be ok." Bullshit. Fat acceptance especially. People that cry about fat shaming are at fault for people like this girl dying. Actions have  consequences. Yes it's sad she died but you know what?  Our society has become so obsessed with accepting everything that now negative consequences of "you're ok just how you are." are ignored.</p>
<p>Our society is pathetic right now. We need more people that are accepting of assholes. Get mad all you want. The truth can be uncomfortable but that's life. Ignore truth because it makes you uncomfortable and you just end up hypothetically dead at 17 because you didn't want to be fat shamed.</p>

        <p>Yes, one person died. It's sad of course. But does that mean we should lockdown? No. It would damage society even more. Economy, mental health and education. "None" cares about depression, anxiety and suicide. "Everyone" cares only about rona deaths. If one person died in a car crash, would we ban cars?</p>

        <p>I mean, cars were deemed dangerous so we implemented seatbelts and airbags and speed limits and other rules. So, yes? In a way we changed the landscape of how we use cars because we realized how dangerous they are. Maybe try some other analogy next time? Like, one person died sucking on a lollipop, should we ban lollipops? I don't know, there are warnings on lollipops too. Maybe as a species we see dangerous things and adapt them to make them less dangerous.</p>

        <p>I may get hate for this but who cares. Normalizing obesity does not change the fact that somebody is obese, it simply makes them less inclined to take care of their own body. </p>
<p>If somebody reading this is overweight, I will not "fat shame" you, but I will care for you enough to not lie to your face and will not tell you your unhealthy habits are healthy. </p>
<p>From the CDC:
Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer that are some of the <strong>leading causes of preventable, premature death.</strong>

        <p>I know, it's sick... It's really sad... I'm mad that the media will use this to scare people when in reality it was the doctors that contributed to her death, I thought it was well known by now that ventilation does more harm than good in the case of covid, I've even read studies ... But everyone saying her obesity caused her death I don't think that's completely right, at 17 your life choices havnt caught up with you yet like say a 50 year old... In my opinion, which is just only that , an opinion, but she was killed by those doctors more than anything and now the media is using her death as fear mongering for covid... And the people in this thread... Alot of you should be ashamed of yourselves, she's a damn child...</p>

        <p>Agreed. Her obesity and overall poor health contributed to her death, but she doesn't deserve to have her life and death laughed at by people who didn't even know her or what caused her to be that size.</p>

        <p>I feel badly, at 17 you are for the most part the result of your parents/upbringing, don't even know who you are yet, and so it's not really her fault. It is difficult being significantly overweight and she never got the chance to recover and live her life 😔</p>

<p>Morbidly obese, asthma, high blood pressure and died from heart complications, plus the hospital put her on a ventilator.  I'm sure none of those other things had anything to do with it.  </p>

        <p>I wish there was a way to single out all the deaths that really were the cause of human overreaction to this disease. Sure, covid is a deadly disease for some people, but much of its deadliness has been inflated due to our insane attempt to be play God and control the uncontrollable.</p>

        <p>I'm probably the biggest asshole on this sub, but I agree. When a KID is in this situation, it isn't like they had much of a choice or any real chance of breaking free of the familial patterns and addictions that caused it. She died of obesity related health problems, isn't that punishment enough?</p>

<p>I’ll swing into a fast food spot occasionally to grab a quick bite when I’m in a hurry for work, and you can definitely see people taking their kids into these places who you can already tell are going to have weight issues in the future due to parents bringing, genes or not, why just feed the problem.

        <p>I don’t think this is fat shaming - this is a highly relevant point. The title is specifically written in order to make people think, “oh no, I have a 17 year old kid who could die” or “I’m 20; if this 17 yo died, I must be at risk.” </p>
<p>Frankly, the article shouldn’t have been written <em>at all.</em> It’s not news (if you disagree, then I expect you hold the position that every single death from or with covid should be covered as an independent news story). This is fear mongering. </p>
<p>Pointing out that this poor girl was morbidly obese is not fat-shaming; it’s a factual counterpoint to the deliberate fear mongering of the article itself.</p>
<p>Edit: I’m talking about the post itself. The comments I’ve seen have not been mocking or shaming the kid. Any comments that do so are despicable.</p>

        <p>I agree with literally everything in your reply, I think the article should never have been written and I think recirculating it is needlessly rude to her family. I didn't read too far into the comments I don't even really have an opinion about fat shaming it just seemed like the proper term to use in this case because of the way the meme was made.</p>

        <p>I'm more worried about things like my high blood pressure, like what this girl had, than about this specific virus that only slightly raises my overall risk compared to what I already had before. I want strategies, not for society to end over this, and it has been a relief to find like-minded people here. I think a lot of the panic and destruction going on is linked to how so many people are addicted to food for comfort and/or convenience due to chronic stress, whether abuse, being overscheduled, etc. </p>
<p>I wish more people would see it that way, but am still working on what's within my own control. Potassium helps balance out sodium, so it's good for blood pressure. Fortunately, there are lots of foods high in potassium, like broccoli, potatoes, almonds, and bananas. Some of them, like bananas, I can still eat quickly if I'm too overwhelmed to pull it together.</p>

        <p>Do you realize how selfish that makes you guys sound? If you guys just stayed home when you were told to, we wouldn’t have to for longer now, because there would be less of a problem. But <em>noooooooo,</em> you just HAD to go to Walmart during a <strong>global fucking pandemic.</strong> There are 15 million cases and 286,000 deaths in the US alone. That’s one in 21 people with COVID. Let that sink in, then maybe reevaluate the life decisions that led you here.</p>

        <p>You guys are the ones who are selfish, you want everyone to change their way of life because you're <em>scawwed</em>. COVID-19 has a 99.9% death rate for people under 50, and most people who die from it are already of passing age and had other complications anyway. Meanwhile people's livelihoods and futures have been destroyed because of the lockdowns,  so get your head out of your ass, reopen the schools, stores, etc. and let people live their fucking lives, I know that you only want this because you've been living in your basement your whole life and want others to join you in your misery but no one wants to, pal.</p>

        <p>I doubt this is true. Last known suicide rate in the USA is approximately 13/100000. Probably significantly higher this year based on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340075/">this</a> paper - see section on mental health. North Dakota has a population of 762062 so there were probably at least 100 suicides this year spread across all demographics. 13% of suicide is youth suicide. And out of those ~13+ kids who committed suicide, many of them will have been pushed over the edge by mental health issues deriving directly from the lockdown and virus fearmongering. There's a significant chance that the government's reaction to the virus has costed the lives of several youths, some of whom were otherwise in good health and would have otherwise gone on to live full healthy lives.</p>

        <p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_by_country_and_territory Covid:
As of 17:21 UTC on 8 December 2020, there are 67,803,057 confirmed cases, 22,562,386 active cases, 43,691,339 recoveries, and 1,549,332 deaths in about 192 countries/territories[4] and 26 cruise/naval ships.</p>
<p>And yes TB is a horrible disease but we have known it for over a century and it is also pretty curabel. The difference with covid is that it was unexpected, it was so contagious that is spread over the world in a matter of moths. Thats why its so dangerous. We didnt know it well enough. The only other time we saw something this bad was 100 years ago with the spanish flu.</p>

        <p>Its not about being scared its about protecting the weak. I would guess u are probably a healthy person under 60 so you would just be very sick. But not all people have this privilege, people with a condition and old people need to be protected and the lockdown is needed to stop the spreading. Its not about being scared, its about being responsible.</p>

        <p>But then we went back into lockdown. Even NZ which had "zero" cases had to go back into lockdown. That's how they work, they're perpetual.</p>

        <p>No shit. Lockdowns are a cycle. You get out of one you have to go into a new one a few months later again and repeat. Just admit it. Or are you too stupid to understand that.</p>

        <p>Holy fuck, okay in my country we had a second wave and yes we are again in lockdown but its almost over because WE FOLLOW THE RULES. And what are u gonna say, that lockdowns are stupid we should open up and hug every person we see. Is it so difficult to even just wear a mask? And this is prob my last message because. “Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.”
