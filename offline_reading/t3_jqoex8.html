    <strong>Sorry for cussing.. but why the actual f**k are people still treating COVID like it's the deadliest disease to ever exist?</strong>
    <p><p>People are acting like we can't live normal lives due to COVID, when actually it's the lockdowns causing that. Sweden is normal and has been for a while now. But I keep seeing people say the virus puts 25% of people with it in ICU and 50% have massive neurological damage and I'm sitting here like ''what the fuck drugs are you on?'' </p>
<p>I'm from Sweden btw. This virus has a 0.1% death rate according to WHO's estimates, the same kind of estimate that knocked H1N1 's death rate from 3-4% to 0.02-0.2%.</p></p>

        <p>It's just fear, the Media's been shoving this shit down out throats for months, telling us it's a deadly pandemic. </p>
<p>I just find it funny how last year the same people demanding we all mask up and stay at home to save lives were saying things like "we need a pandemic or something, there's too many people and humans suck".</p>

        <p>I find it disgusting that people my age (mid twenties) wanted the boomers to die off so they can’t keep voting republican (yes I realize not every old person votes republican, it’s just more common than not) and now all of a sudden they care deeply about the elderly.</p>

        <p>Those people never cared about their grandparents. If they truly cared about their grandma/grandpa/elderly family member they would first of all check the quality of the care home before they put them in the care home, make sure there is no abuse going on, visit them often, call them often etc. </p>
<p>All this "care" young people are showing to elderly is fake and virtue signaling.</p>

        <p>The elderly aren't some innocent sub-class that needs to be protected at all costs. These people already lived through almost their entire life. Many of them became pieces of shit because of those lives.</p>
<p>An old person deserves to be shoved in some abusive hellhole if they spent their entire lives abusing their family. The young are not obligated to care for the old on principle alone. That care is earned.</p>
<p>I am absolutely not saying that every elderly person in a shitty home deserves to be there. Merely that at least a measurable portion of them definitely earned that COVID-19 death.</p>

        <p>There are millions of people in my demographic as well. Young people who started off terrified of the virus and accidentally killing elderly people, but now don't give a remote shit due to virus fatigue. The virus isn't going to kill me, and the people in "at risk" groups should have left the public spotlight months ago.</p>
<p>I can assess my own personal level risk and act accordingly. It's absolutely not my fault and not my problem if <strong>8 months into the pandemic</strong> some 80-year-old chain smoker shops at the grocery without a mask, I pass COVID to them, and they end up hospitalized.</p>
<p>They know the risk and they shouldn't have been in the store <strong>at all</strong>. They should have sent a family member or neighbor who is my age to do their shopping for them. I'm done putting my life on hold to protect the stupid.</p>
<p>I will be courteous and continue to wear a mask in public, but I refuse to barricade myself in my house anymore.</p>

        <p>People are weak minded and they settle for assuming the loudest person in the room is the correct one. TPTB know this and use it for their advantage. These people don’t know how to do their own research, so it’s not surprising when there is conflicting information they just side with the easiest option. </p>
<p>I don’t want to say that we’re dealing with idiots here because honestly language like that doesn’t help much either (true as you think it may be). These people have too much trust in mainstream and the programming they have endured has been in some cases multigenerational. It wasn’t easy for me to see through it all but I eventually did.</p>
<p>I think the only thing that can help us are the whistleblowers (maybe celebs) speaking out. The more people who speak out about this absolute horse shit pandemic the better. Fuck their careers, it won’t be worth shit in a karmic court room.</p>

        <p>that would require the Chinese, Iranian, Saudi, Russian, European and US governments to all work together for a common cause.  </p>
<p>I feel like that's a bit of a stretch tbh given how different their government types are and usually how hostile they usually are to one another.<br>
I mean, we could argue that everything we know about geo-politics over the past century is lies but that's a lot to just conveniently sweep under a rug to make a theory work.</p>

        <p>Now that the media got what they want out of the election, they will stop reporting cases. Look at this week alone: 125,000 cases a day and nobody cares since all they saw was election coverage.  Give it a few weeks into January and you won't hear about Rona again.  People will claim "Saint Biden" cured us from the plague.</p>
<p>Trust for the vaccine right now is low, again cause of the media. When Biden is in office that EXACT SAME vaccine will all-of-a-sudden be trustworthy and ready for the masses.</p>

        <p>I'm praying you're correct. I'm at a point where I don't care how the charade ends so long as it ends. I still hear talk of Biden doing lockdowns and I can't do it again. Especially not for something as benign as covid with all the new and updated science showing just how little of a threat it actually is. I want the timeline where everyone stops giving a shit and no more lockdowns/restrictions because Biden is the cure apparently.</p>

        <p>And this is exactly why I have been living in a waking nightmare since March. Nothing about the narrative that the world believes is true or makes any sense. It isn't even remotely based in logic, reason, or any sort of reality. Yet they have them convinced that this is the deadliest infectious disease in modern times, hence all these dystopian restrictions are necessary...because it's such an "unprecedented" virus. Nope...a 0.15% is not unprecedented at all...this entire worldwide psychotic reaction to it is what is unprecedented. And as for you mentioning you had it and it was nothing compared to the flu, I'm pretty sure I must have gotten it back in July as my mom got it from her workplace and she visited several times while displaying symptoms. She was afraid to go get tested because she didn't want them to force her to quarantine for two weeks without pay. She finally got tested as weakly positive at the end of a week-long period where she felt flu-like symptoms (my mom is 61, so she makes sense she was more likely to have symptoms). I had not one single symptom. Neither did my brother, or several other people under 50 that had contact with my mom during that week. In 2018, I got very sick with the flu...whatever that strain of the flu was is far more virulent for young people than covid, a virus that young people are basically immune to. Yet so many idiots my age are afraid that this is a plague that will kill them and their kids. When confronted with facts, and therefore caught in their ignorance, they always switch to some disingenuous bullshit about "protecting the elderly".</p>

        <p>This is a <em>very</em> hard time to be alive for anyone capable of critical thought.  Can you imagine being an up and coming epidemiologist right now?  Or a med student?  Of course they are so overwhelmed with memorization tasks and testing that they don’t even have time to lift their head to see the forest through the trees.</p>

        <p>Your anecdote doesn’t mean shit. But if it does, my friend’s parents both died from covid. Now what?</p>
<p>My parents are both not quite elderly and in good shape. To me and to them, the risk of getting infected is just not worth it. The risk of dying, small as it is, is still there. And then, the greater risk of hospitalization and going into crippling debt is there too. Also, the risk of infecting others and FORCING the potential of these things to happen to them is morally incomprehensible to us. There’s a reason people are trying to stay home. It’s not about their minuscule chances of dying. It’s about the three degrees of separation between them and someone who will die.</p>

<p>Sure, like those who can should be working from home. But here I sit at my desk at the bank I work at doing a job I could do just as effectively from home. When companies force you to work in person even during a global pandemic, it is not about the 'safety of others', it is about control. It's perfectly acceptable to interact with all my coworkers. Share a bathroom, eat lunch together in the breakroom, etc. But I am killing grandma if I go out to a bar? It's absolutely ridiculous.</p>

        <p>You still aren't thinking about the big picture. Say you have covid, you don't know it yet, but you go out drinking anyways. You presumably don't have a mask on, since nobody does. You end up talking to a group of healthy people your age, and over time, they breathe in your droplets and contract covid. These people, seemingly healthy, then go visit their parents. Not elderly, not really at much risk, right? They'll be fine! So the parents of a person you gave covid to now have covid. So then, the parents decide they want to go see the husband's father, which is the person you talked to's grandfather. They've been "socially distancing," and the only person they've come in contact with was their son. This all seems fine, right? Well now, these elderly grandparents both have covid, and because they're elderly, and likely have preexisting conditions, they're much more likely to get a severe case and potentially die.</p>
<p>You literally very well could be killing grandma by going to a bar. It's not ridiculous at all. It's very common. There's a reason there are so many older people dying. Precisely because of younger people going to bars.</p>

        <p>I agree with your summary of the risks. Please explain how it is different when I am forced to go to work and interact with my coworkers. We eat lunch in a small kitchenette with no masks. We crowd in for birthday cake parties with no masks. That is allowed but I can't do the same thing in my personal life? Absolute bullshit. If this was about stopping the spread, I would be allowed to work from home.</p>

        <p>Exactly. If everyone that could be remote was doing so, you would cut your contract significantly. The fact that no one cares to do that shows me they don't care about saving anyone. It's all a show to make it appear they care. If they don't care, why should I? Furthermore, I have had people shake my hand, hug me, take sips of my drink, not wash hands, etc like everything is normal. If they don't care, why should I? I'm sick of being chicken little</p>

        <p>Wow you are so full of shit, such a typical response from a member of this covid cult. The "six degrees of separation" nonsense can literally happen with any infectious disease. Up until clownworld of this year, it was understood by society that unintentionally infecting someone who infected someone else, who infected someone else, who then died because they were an 85 year-old, is not anyone's fault. How do you think my grandparents died of the flu? And it's not an "anecdote" when the IFR of this virus is literally 0.15%. Once again, the facts that your ilk will gleefully keep ignoring so you can LARP and virtue signal and spew your regurgitated sanctimonious shit, while wantonly destroying society. If you knew something about how viruses work instead of literally just mindlessly repeating the same exact bullshit that media fed you...you would know that this is how every cold virus starts. A virus like this doesn't mutate into something more dangerous, it eventually becomes a common cold...just like the six other coronavirus colds. Even if it did have the miniscule chance of mutating into something slightly more lethal, none of this dystopian shit would be worth it and none of it would be able to stop that. You do realize the flu is highly mutagenic, mutates every year, and could mutate into a strain that actually has a 2.5% IFR....the CFR of covid. But the risk of that is so miniscule that you don't wreak havoc on the world in a vain attempt to stop it.</p>

        <p>And it's not really that elderly person's fault either. They have a right to go out in public and live their lives. It's just no one's fault if they contract a low IFR respiratory virus that "kills" them because they are old and frail and have reached or are nearing, the end of their natural lifespan. A couple of years ago, my 88 year-old grandfather died of the flu. In the last year of his life, he was mostly bedridden and never left his house. The only way he could have been exposed to the flu is through his caregiver (my aunt). So someone must have exposed her to that strain of the flu, and someone must have gotten it from them, and someone else must have gotten it from that person, etc. Was anyone a selfish murderer here? Do I blame whoever started that chain of influenza infection and are they guilty of anything? Of course not. Prior to March of this year, society understood that respiratory viruses unintentionally passed between humans was no one's responsibility and culpability. This whole cult of insanity that has taken over society and that pretends otherwise is either a. Full of sanctimonious bullshit that are saying and doing this crap to feel like virtuous heroes or b. Never understood how viruses and other pathogens work and how they are transmitted, and how omnipresent they are...or c. Both</p>

<p>I disagree. Those of us who are not "at risk" should be able to get back to our lives now. We're almost a year into this pandemic now, and if those "at risk" groups STILL haven't gotten the fucking memo to get out of the public spotlight, it's not my problem if I pass COVID onto them.</p>
<p>I'm not going to worry about some elderly person dying when I go into the grocery store any longer. That 80-year-old chain smoker not wearing a mask made the decision to be there and that's not my problem. They shouldn't even be in the store and that shouldn't have anything to do with me.</p>
<p>The people who are truly "at risk" are the ones who should be living this "new normal", not people like us.</p>

        <p>The difference between this sub's demographic and me is that while I personally don't give a remote shit, I still mask up and do my part without bitching about it. It's simply a perceptual change. I can now go into the grocery store without pretending to care about all the old people there.</p>

        <p>It's not some grand conspiracy. A lot of us have just realized it's not our problem anymore. We're more than 8 months into this pandemic, and if people in truly "at risk" groups still haven't gotten the fucking memo to stay home, it's not my fault if they get themselves killed. Fuck them.</p>
<p>I'm not in an at risk group and it's not my obligation to protect people who make stupid decisions. Only the government tries to claim that ability. I will no longer allow my life to be held hostage by these idiots.</p>

        <p>Thank you. Your voice of reason is heard. 
People don’t understand transmission to the elderly is one risk, but also the chance for covid to evolve/mutate to a strain we can’t get under control. We don’t need another “flu season” to happen parallel to the one we already have every year. </p>
<p>We don’t need to pile on any more sicknesses that won’t “go away”. Don’t you guys understand if we just let viruses run a muck, they get worse and never go away?</p>

Directions when I asked about the dangers during chemo were that it is cold and flu season so stay home the week that counts go down, wash your hands and if you have to be out on low count days where you’ll be around people, wear a surgical mask if you have to.

        <p>Wishing the best for you. Have a family member whose cancer just returned. He was very concerned about the threat of covid with his weakened immune system and the nurses told him it’s no greater threat to him than any other virus or flu and that they’ve actually found that their cancer patients have excellent covid outcomes and most have few if any symptoms. He tested positive a month into his treatments, no symptoms or anything, he was perfectly fine.</p>

        <p>I have attempted many times to present numbers for covid death (and the numbers are debatable) next to numbers of death caused by other infectious diseases and illnesses, and they still do not budge. </p>
<p>The only things that I think are influencing their sudden laser focus on this “deadly virus” is that it’s  new and every single case and statistic involved is being tracked and obsessed over. If we had death counters constantly displaying every flu death or every pneumonia death in an elderly person we might also generate panic.</p>

        <p>Yes it’s “new”, but cold and flu viruses mutate all the time, making those strains “new.”  When bacteria develop antibiotic resistance that makes them “new” too, like MRSA that killed my young friend.  Honestly antibiotic resistance scares me more than this bug ever did.!  People are dumb sheep and need to shut off the media for good.</p>

        <p>I've noticed that the pro lockdown people have very different values than me. They values quantity - basically the number of years lived. While I values quality, how enjoyable life is over the quantity.</p>
<p>I don't want to die like how most people don't want to die, but I would rather die younger and have an enjoyable life than live a long and miserable one.</p>

<p>Exactly. Imagine that's been going on this whole time. It's crazy what our fantasies and narratives can lead us to do. We are at the mercy of whatever narrative is created by the crowd (us)</p>

        <p>This was a great real world example. Reminds me of the Twilight Zone episode when someone started messing with power outages in a small town and they all started making theories and blaming each other and even became violent.</p>
<p>"The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout. There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices...to be found only in the minds of men. For the record, prejudices can kill...and suspicion can destroy...and a thoughtless, frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own—for the children and the children yet unborn. And the pity of it is that these things cannot be confined to the Twilight Zone."</p>

        <p>Donald Trump drinks half a case of diet Coke every day, eats exclusively McDonald's fish sandwiches, and hasn't exercised in 40 years.</p>
<p>He was the exact type of person people think would die from covid and he kicked the disease in 3 days and got right back to work.</p>
<p>No more of this "oh only if you're old or at risk" talk. This is the flu. That is the worst it gets for this disease. Someone is inevitably going to say "oh well my grandma died from covid how could you say it's not deadly?" and my answer to that is that hundreds of thousands of people die from the flu every year, and we never shut down the country over that.</p>

        <p>Just a comment of something that happened today.  I'm very pro-mask (but against "lockdowns") and wear a mask when in public places.  Today I was just walking up the street to return something to the outside library book drop and didn't take a mask.  A book sale outside was going on and a woman wearing a mask was coming towards me along this very wide sidewalk.  She stepped off the sidewalk into the parking lot street that outlets at the main road and didn't realize a car was coming at slow speed behind her.  She adjusted her course but when I looked back she was back on the sidewalk.  So she'd rather step into the street than pass someone not wearing a mask.  People have gone insane.</p>

        <p>You must not live in LA. That is literally the norm here. Every single time I take a walk in my neighborhood, almost every single person I pass makes some big dramatic semi circle out into the street (completely disregarding any potential oncoming traffic) just to avoid me because I’m not wearing a mask. It’s so fucking dehumanizing and depressing. </p>
<p>Meanwhile I was just in Florida and everywhere I walked most people weren’t wearing masks and actually would smile and say hi. What a concept!</p>

        <p>Regardless of my opinion on the pandemic, we're more than 8 months into this thing and I am not in an at risk group. The people likely to die from the virus have had more than 8 months to assess their personal level of risk. If they still decide to go shopping during the start of flu season, that's their responsibility. I won't accept fault for passing COVID to someone who was vehemently reminded to stay out of the public spotlight for months.</p>
<p>The virus won't kill me, and I have no need to live in fear of it. It's not my job to worry on behalf of other people.</p>

<p>This was a fantastic line of argument... in late March. I'm not going to acknowledge this "six degrees of separation" bullshit any longer. We're more than 8 months into this thing now, and if these "at risk" groups still haven't gotten the memo to stay out of the public spotlight, that's not my problem anymore.</p>
<p>They've had more than 8 months to assess their personal level of risk. I am not in an at risk group. If they make the decision to interact with people like me, I refuse to take responsibility for that.</p>
<p>I do still wear a mask in public, but that's the absolute limit of what I will tolerate any longer. I won't allow my life to be held hostage by the same old people who economically abandoned Millennials.</p>

        <p>Imo by wearing a mask you're already helping out. I do think that if healthy people who aren't at risk and dont want to mask up don't mind spreading it then they should get fined. At risk people still need to go get groceries and whatnot.</p>

        <p>Diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and mental illness from prolonged lockdowns and mask mandates are far more deadly than COVID.

        <p>A million and a half people, out of a population of almost 8 billion, have died from this feared disease. <strong>Most</strong> of those deaths are elderly and/or compromised individuals.  In other words, <em>hardly anyone dies from this disease</em>, and those that do, would probably have died anyway.

        <p>Entertainment. Covid is part of the 2020 election "crises". Portland used the National Guard on the rioters a day or so after the election. Covid has a lot more social momentum i.e. training people to wear masks, separate, stay home, etc. It will likely be removed as it becomes politically expedient. I imagine that as soon as Biden can claim responsibility for the economic boost, we'll see a full reopen.</p>

        <p>Hey man I her your roars loud and clear, but the US (not all but enough) are so brainwashed and desperate for this pandemic to be real they will believe anything. The recent election was not about two opposing candidates or party's, people were merely voting in favor of a belief, either Pro Lockdown or Anti Lockdown, and the Pro Lockdown belief won. </p>
<p>Despite the overwhelming evidence of a non existent pandemic, expect that measures are going to continue to escalate, which initially will be welcomed by the majority segment, that is until they begin to experience the collateral impacts. To effectively give the illusion that Biden will be the savior of a false pandemic out of control, they will need to take a drastic action to mitigate the damage caused by Trumps "inaction", therefore I anticipate either a miracle vaccine and /or heavy lock downs once he take the seat.</p>

        <p>I hear you. Each nation is handling this differently. Not everyone is being subjugated in the same way or to the same degree.</p>
<p>The easiest way is the MLK/Ghandi passive resistance. There's 8 billion people and who knows, maybe 10,000 psychopathic rulers, tops...possibly (a lot) less.</p>
<p>What this has shown me is that most people will adapt to anything.</p>
<p>If "authority" tells them to jump off a cliff, some would. But some answer to themselves, conscience, god, rational conclusions...they can't force everyone to jump.</p>
<p>When I see a lovely tall and elegant girl walking her dog in the park and she has on no mask, unlike the 70%, at that moment she seems to be the most beautiful girl in the whole world. I hold that memory and forget the rest.</p>

        <p>Yes, unfortunately it is part of our psychological makeup that makes us vulnerable to manipulation even to the point where we see today that people are willing to discard any level of reason.</p>
<p>I honestly believe many of us have fallen into a deep psychosis, and their reality is based on the belief of the pandemic, they cannot psychologically survive without it. The psychopaths' of course know this, and it now requires very little maintenance to uphold to the point as evident in the blatant lies and contradictions they openly spew. We've reached a juncture where they are now simply mocking us.</p>

<p>Survival are seen as more important than entertainment like restaurant, pubs/bars etc. Mental health and businesses aren't considered survival. They wants pure survival, while everything else are less prioritized.</p>

        <p>People were afraid and listened to the news and hype in March. Once someone puts a idea in someone’s head especially that changes their entire life or decisions, they tend to stick with it and don’t periodically check to see if it’s still valid.</p>
<p>Just as a random less pressing example, 30-40 years ago 3000 miles was recommended as a oil change interval or 3 months. In the United States, many believe that this is still the recommended mileage, because A) they don’t look at the actual recommendations from manufacturers or in the manual, and B) oil change companies have a vested interest in misleading the public and would lose money if more people followed the official guidance of 6/12 months and 5000-10000 miles depending on the car. </p>
<p>We have the same thing with this virus. People aren’t looking up the official stats on their own, and also the governments and news agencies have a vested interest in not advertising the current IFR, at least where I live. Policy compliance would drop overnight.</p>

        <p>Didn't you hear? PCR tests are up? New cases every day, the total death is now a scary number that has grown since november of 2019, no context for that number, it's just going up. No quarters no seasons. I mean hospitals, even though my country build dozens new ones to handle the expected overflow, which remain unused to this day, (sorry poor sentence structure) they hospitals are overflowing again! It's the peoples fault for not wearing slave masks and not anti-social distancing. I'ts our fault grandpa's and ma's are dying</p>

        <p>As a healthcare professional that works with the public in a retail pharmacy, I’ll say that 80% of ppl prescribed new meds have literally no idea what they are doing or “idk talk to my wife” about their new diabetes meds and what not. Most ppl don’t care or are too stupid to care about their health without a major wake up call (heart attack etc). You are making good points</p>

        <p>I've been asking the same question ("why are we still pretending that covid is deadly to everybody") for 5-6 months now.  What is even more ridiculous/infuriating to me is when I hear people state that "we can't go back to normal until there's a vaccine" ... For a virus with a ~99.whatever% survival rate.

        <p>&rt; if you have no underlying conditions and you get it, you’re gonna feel like shit for a few days but probably make it. </p>
<p>Do you just make shit up as you talk? Do you have any interest whatsoever in reality? </p>
<p>A huge percentage of cases are asymptomatic. </p>
<p>As far as “probably make it” ... super weird way to describe a 99.5% survival rate under 70 (and the survival rate gets significantly higher the younger you go; for children, driving in a car to school is statistically more dangerous than covid). Personally, I’d go with <strong>virtually certain to survive,</strong> but that’s only because I care about facts and accuracy.</p>

        <p>Glad to see I'm not the only one to prefer it to the flu. I had it in the middle of March, was one of the first 500 cases in Houston. The flu was debilitating for a week and a half, but covid came in waves. I got all of the symptoms over the period of time I had it, but never all at once. I would be fine for a few hours, able to sit up and watch a movie, eat and drink, but then after a bit I would crater and feel like garbage for another few hours before I came back up. It was weird, but I prefer the rollercoasterness of it to the constant shit of the flu.</p>

        <p>Yes, I can’t force anyone to do anything. But, it speaks volumes about people who can’t be bothered to help out their fellow man by expending almost no effort.</p>
<p>I’ve tried being civil and keeping this friendly but you’re coming off as hostile. I really don’t know what to tell people that have no consideration for anyone besides themselves. It’s the death of decency and why the rest of the world hates us. It’s the reason why this will drag on for years when other nations have greatly reduced the loss of life. </p>
<p>Nothing anyone can think to say will matter to folks like you with this attitude. It won’t matter until you personally find your life at risk. Not your parents, spouse or kids. Your own life. It’s quite sad.</p>
<p>People will downvote this because I speak a truth they don’t want to face. That if everyone could just work together, we could get past this and move forward. Unfortunately, I feel that the events of 2020 have split this country so severely, we won’t be able to move forward together. It’s spite and hate for our neighbors because we don’t see things the same way. I get it because I can’t understand why people are so selfish that they will put others at risk rather than wear a mask.</p>
<p>It’s the American attitude for so many people that they don’t care what the rest of the world thinks of us. You have to realize that they don’t want us in their country. We’ve been telling ourselves for so long that we are the best and everyone wants to be us that some people can’t recognize how foolish they look on the world stage. Considerable damage has been done to our image and I would estimate it’s going to take a generation for us to recover in the eyes of the world. The sadder thing is that so many people think their shit doesn’t stink and don’t care about what the rest of the world thinks of us.</p>
<p>Talk about narcissistic. It’s pretty sad to see this shot happen to this nation. I hope everyone’s “freedumbs” are worth it.</p>

        <p>the reasons for caution is that it is new so we don't know how it impacts <em>all of the people</em> when they get it. Nobody knows what the long term impact is of things like LONGVID so people are cautious. Right now, all we know is what happens when maybe 20% of a population gets it, will that be the same when 80% get it? We can sample towards an educated guess but the recent election in the US demonstrates that there can be issues with the sampling approach that pollsters used there. </p>
<p>A good example of this "unexpected" is the mutation apparently seen in Danish mink farms. Because we're not experienced with the virus we don't know if this is as bad as it gets or something unexpected will happen.  </p>
<p>I agree that its likely a lot of this caution is overbearing, just remember that people are spooked and its arguably fair to be because the situation is new and if we let everyone get the virus then its not possible to undo that.</p>

        <p>The counterpoint is that, the virus has proven to be much more benign/treatable than originally believed, and our continued reliance on lockdowns only gives it more time to mutate in potentially harmful ways.</p>

        <p>I agree but governments and organisations are all about over optimising what it is that you can measure/perceive and under optimising whatever you can't.   </p>
<p>The overloading of healthcare systems being the current "over-optimisation" at play here. Idk what the "right" move is, I figure we'll know in two years time but nobody knows today.<br>

        <p>No, the issue is that elected officials are cowardly sheep and wolves: The sheep are terrified of doing things that their voters won’t support at the polls, and the wolves want to hold onto as much power as possible for as much time as possible.</p>
<p>That means that the lockdowns will continue until we, the people, insist that they stop.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that the media is still actively stoking the fears of the general populace, and there aren’t enough people yet willing to stand up and oppose the mob mentality.</p>

        <p>Because people who think this way aren’t grasping the point. </p>
<p>Hospitals and healthcare workers cannot handle even what they have now. So if it continues to go berserk you’ll have healthcare workers being utterly destroyed (as they are now). The sick will be in the streets. The virus will mutate faster etc. </p>
<p>You are completely taking for granted hospitals and the people who work there. </p>
<p>Furthermore long term you have no idea what it’ll do to your body. You can pontificate about how it’s no big deal but we truly won’t know until years later. You’re also ofc ignoring everyone who is at risk such as the sick, elderly, and obese. </p>
<p>Everyone is sick of corona. I too want it to end. But if you’re gonna be an adult in this world you’ve just gotta do shit you don’t wanna do sometimes. Consequences are facts not opinions.</p>

        <p>Lol no where near .8%, very high estimates are at .45 maybe .5% </p>
<p>what is your source?</p>
<p>About 17% of the us is over 65. Every year the country skews slightly older causing the death rate to increase by a growth of  about 1.12% year on year.</p>
<p>There has been no visibly significant death rate change for 2020 .
In 2017 it was 8.580 per 1000
In 2018 it was 8.685 per 1000
In 2019 it was 8.782 per 1000
In 2020 it was 8.80 per 1000</p>
<p>If there is any excess mortality it will be a little from covid, but alot of it will be from the lockdowns. The death of senior people of covid this year is liekly show up as a Reduction in  excess deaths for the elderly a year from now, but the death due to poverty and lockdowns will only increase as we continue to lockdown.</p>
<p>Death is a reality of life, this strong flu virus is not out of the ordinary, it seems like the west is just coming to grips the with the fact that people die in large numbers at a certain age. We also used to call this during of natural causes.</p>

        <p>Also the "bowl of hundred mm&amp;s" bullshit is completely invalid analogy. A 30 year-old literally has a higher chance of being struck by lightning than dying of covid. Even if the IFR really was 0.8%, which it most certainly isn't anywhere near that, as even the WHO admits that the real number of cases is along the lines of 800 million...the 0.8% would not be across the board. It would simply be an average that is skewed higher by the higher IFR for those over 75, and the virtually non-existent IFR for those under 30.</p>

<p>Like, why the fuck would you even argue that?  We already know as factual reality that <em>at least</em> 220k people have died of confirmed Covid-19 in the US. So <em>obviously</em> that is a significant death rate change.</p>

        <p>Some excess deaths are due to covid. You assume all of them are, which is incorrect to say the least. 
But as I said, it is not really significant in the grand scheme of things, next year there will be a negative excess deaths to compensate for the harvesting effect.
if you had a tally of all the flu deaths in the US 2017 to 2018 it is estimated at 56,000 in the us. Big numbers don't mean shit unless you compare them.</p>
<p>I dunno in the us but in the uk it is estimated that 26000 people have died due to poverty inflicted by lockdown this year in comparison to our 40 to 50 thousand covid deaths. (Also magically we have no normal flu this year)</p>
<p>Do you care about the 1.6 million people die of TB worldwide every year? Did you wear a mask last year to prevent the 56000 flu deaths?</p>
<p>Honestly, it's a bit sad that I know most arguments you will throw at me and I don't have time to outline all of them in a post. But you have no idea what arguments I have or why I am making them.</p>

<p>Yep, there is the answer.  If 5 people that you know have to die, you just don't care.  So, if you went to a football stadium with 75,000 people in attendance that means 600 people would die.  Just from attending a football game.  600 is 0.8% of 75000.  Gilette Stadium </p>
<p>If 600 people were being shot by invisible mass shooters, every single game, would you support temporarily stopping football games until they caught the shooter?</p>

        <p>But it isn't about the disease being deadly, they're scaring us because if everyone were to get sick at the same time then we would not have the health care infrastructure to accommodate them. Then no one would be able to go to the hospital and shit would get really messed up.</p>
<p>Covid is unique because of its longer incubation period than other diseases, not because it's deadlier. With the flu, you're only contagious and asymptomatic for up to like 3 days. You can carry and be asymptomatic with covid for up to 14 days. That's 14 days to unknowingly spread the virus. If you expose yourself to a lot of people in that time then that will Spike the amount of infected people, some of whom will inevitably go to the hospital, and collectively it poses a risk to the health care system that will be overwhelmed with covid cases and unable to treat other things. </p>
<p>In my opinion the best solution would be rapid testing-- before walking into the club, for example, you could take a covid test and if it's negative you can go right in and let loose like you normally would. But of course that would be expensive and use resources that may not be plentiful.</p>

        <p>All I keep hearing is El Paso. Is this some backyard swamp place, because it seems it's the only place in the world where they can't get their shit together and ensure hospital capacity?</p>
<p>Hospitals usually operate close to the full capacity during flu seasons, because it's expensive to maintain the extra capacity for the rest of the year. This does not prevent developed countries (most EU countries) to quickly ramp up capacity and set up extra beds and ICUs.</p>

        <p>Some parts of Italy had problems with capacity at the peak of the epidemic in the spring, yes. The article about France is from 2019, so I don't know what point you're trying to make. Eventually Europe managed despite the strain.</p>
<p>This virus is not the societal problem that it's being presented as. Minimal precautions and better management of resources is all it takes to control the situation until either a vaccine comes along or a natural seasonal decrease in infections solves the problem.</p>

<p>As far as “probably make it” ... super weird way to describe a 99.5% survival rate under 70 (and the survival rate gets significantly higher the younger you go; for children, driving in a car to school is statistically more dangerous than covid).

        <p>A lot of what you are saying is wrong.  Asymptomatic transmission is very rare.  14 days is an outside limit, not common.  I know you believe this stuff sincerely but it's inaccurate information.  Also, everyone isn't going to get it at once.  This has been going on since March - many people have already been exposed.  If everyone didn't get it at once back in the spring, they aren't all going to get it at once now because many people have already gotten it and recovered while others have been exposed and not gotten it, meaning they probably have a strong resistance to it.</p>

Do you think about all the lives you could save if you just didn’t get on the highway In your car? Turn off the Tv. Live your life. Hospitals have been overwhelmed before during flu seasons. And guess what? We’re all gonna die, that’s life. People weren’t going to the hospital anyways because they were so fucking scared of catching the big bad rona, and ended up having heart attacks at home. So, either way, it’s fucked. But people aren’t going to stop their lives, stop feeding their families, stop working, for something that has an incredibly high survival rate.

        <p>No retorts? This whole thread is saying that something being contagious isn't the only thing that makes it deadly. There are so many bigger problems, especially problems from quarantining, that are not contagious. Just bc something isn't contagious doesn't mean it isn't important and that you shift all of society to making it not spread. The disease is waaay less deadly than its projections. </p>
<p>It's impossible to enforce quarantining and masks, if you have ever gone outside a wealthy city or suburb you would see people do not comply. These people have decided this virus isn't worth rearranging their life for.

        <p>Thats why we're in the situation, because too many people can't do the bare fucking minimum. Nobody wants to shut down the economy, we could be back to normal right now if people listened to the experts and acted responsible. Instead it's been "who cares, it'll go away" for the past 6 months. We're supposed to be the greatest country in the world and we're doing the absolute WORST. Japan had 3 deaths yesterday, we had 1,013.</p>

        <p>I think you need to stop assuming people don't know what's best for them and worry about yourself. You are in an endless cycle. Maybe it's time to realize people just don't care given all the news and info on covid, and they prioritize risks that seem bigger. </p>
<p>And it's false to say that covid is about caring about people. 10 people are being held hostage and will be spared if 9 are sent to be killed. It is extremely sick to round up random people who have nothing to do with the disease. xyz old people are at risk so we make millions of people innocent people suffer. In every ethics debate that is wrong. </p>
<p>Doesn't even matter what either of us think bc you CANNOT enforce this any more than you can enforce heterosexuality.</p>

        <p>In what world do you think a 2 week lockdown would have actually made a bit of difference? That’s a cute thought. </p>
<p>As far as the US leading the world in deaths, we have the 3rd largest population and a huge number of our deaths came from mismanagement of nursing homes and sending covid patients back into them in certain states. I don’t believe China’s numbers for a second. Of course we have higher numbers, we have more people.</p>

        <p>I think a huge problem is people not complying with health care measures... The countries that are doing the best are countries that are already isolated (eg countries that are literal islands like japan and new Zealand) or countries whose population respects the health care measures that were put in place.</p>
<p>Ultimately the reason it hasn't gone crazy viral is BECAUSE of compliance to the excessive quarantine measures. Quarantine brings on a range of other problems, but it works on a very basic level. I really hope rapid testing becomes an alternative and that self isolation doesn't become the go to way to deal with this, but it's sad to think people don't have the self control to just stay home for 2 weeks. If we could've stuck to just 2 first weeks of self isolation and no air travel there'd be less of a problem, because that 14 days of potential carrying would dwindle and after quarantine youre theoretically fine assuming EVERYONE has quarantined. But hey, it's easier to just shrug and say "Well I'm not sick , it's not so bad, I don't want my FREEDOM impeded on" when in reality that's a pretty selfish mentality to have.</p>

        <p>As long as some people are still out around others, it will spread. Not everyone can just “stay home” for two weeks, and if you are able to you have no place to speak for those who can’t. We still need food, therefore we need truck drivers to deliver, employees at the stores. The “essential” employees need to work, which involves transportation, so public transport needs to be a thing and gas stations must be attended and open and gas must be delivered. Auto shops open for emergencies if the vehicles of these so called essential employees have issues. Because emergencies do happen you cannot completely cut off air travel-that’s just not feasible.  How would you feel if you got news that a close family member in another state was on their deathbed and you couldn’t fly there to be with them? Or if you had a life threatening medical condition and needed to fly to another state/country to receive the treatment you need to live? So you have some people flying, pilots and flight attendants and airport employees working. Healthcare employees working. Some people don’t always have the ability to cook at home so at least some fast food restaurants open and staffed. Vets open and staffed. And of course people living with these “essential” employees (I quote essential because I don’t believe for a second that not every single job is absolutely essential to those who do them and hate the term). </p>
<p>As long as you have some people out and about and interacting, this will spread. It’s an effective virus, that’s what it does. So even your perfect little 2 week lockdown does nothing. It still spreads among those who are out and working and needing to shop for certain things, and when we reopen of course cases go back up. also it’s laughable after what we’ve seen so far that you actually think 2 weeks would be 2 weeks. Maybe people could handle staying home for that amount of time if that would be it, but of course it wouldn’t be. Back in March when the initial 2 weeks happened, everyone I know stayed home. Nobody was out partying or anything, people stayed home and went to the grocery store. They complied with the measures we were told, so your noncompliance thing is bs. Kind of hard to not comply when everything is closed. And tell me what good that did besides starting a cycle that destroyed lives in numerous other ways?</p>
