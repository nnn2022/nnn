    <strong>Local business prides themselves in telling customers who can't wear a mask to F off</strong>
    <p><p>I am all for supporting a local business if their product exceeds the quality of a product that I can get elsewhere, and Paul's Bakery (local donut chain in Fredericksburg, VA) has some excellent donuts, but after one of their recent Facebook posts, I don't know how interested I am about going back. </p>
<p>Executive Order 63 in Virginia (the mask mandate) has a list of exemptions in section D that, if every establishment followed wouldn't be much of an issue. Unfortunately there have been a lot of businesses that have decided to make their own rules instead of following the state guidelines which would make things simple and consistent, but Paul's Bakery took it about five steps too far. </p>
<p>On their most recent Facebook post, they said "Masks are mandatory in our establishment. We have this policy to protect our staff and customers. You will be denied service if you’re not wearing a mask. It is our right as a private business, on private property, to require masks. If you don’t like our policy go get a frozen donut from a chain shop that doesn’t care about quality. " </p>
<p>Rule number one about customer service, especially if you are competing with chains, is to make every one of your customers feel welcome. If you as a business feel comfortable telling someone who, for any number of reasons who isn't able to wear a mask that they are absolutely unwelcome, then I don't want anything to do with them. I would rather go somewhere that doesn't feel the compulsion to say things like this. </p>

        <p>Hilarious that people who care about their "health" and "safety" would wear a mask while buying donuts.</p>
<p>You're right about customer service, though.  They might regret their decision to fuck off some of their customers if they join the many small businesses that are failing right now.</p>

<p>Eh... The very vast majority of small businesses I've seen in PA have been like this, including being very quick and very harsh about forcing their customers to mask up. This includes some that have closed up already.</p>

        <p>If PA is like my state, the shops have to enforce the mandates or they are fined or closed.  They don't have to be assholes about it, though, like that donut shop.  It's a freaking donut shop!  Like they're really contributing to the community's health.</p>

        <p>Yes, they are enforced, and it seems they are quite strict about that on the northeast coast. Still, yes, they seem to be pretty mean about it, and "sassy".</p>

        <p>It's hard because it feels like it's everywhere up here. There's some that are more lax than others, but you basically can't do anything up here without a mask on.</p>

        <p>It's pretty much the same here in Ohio.  Although yesterday I was in a store near my home, one I go to semi-regularly, and the owner wasn't wearing a mask.  His wife wasn't wearing one the time I was there before that.  They haven't been wearing masks for at least a month, neither him or his wife, when I've been in their store.  I have to wear one according to our governor's mandate and the sign on their door, but next time I'm there I plan on asking the owners if I need one.  If I don't, they just became my favorite store.</p>

        <p>Maybe.  My area isn't really rural, but when I've been in rural places here I still see everyone masked up.  Except that store I mentioned which is in the city.</p>

        <p>Yeah I don't  go out much or I might see some of that too.</p>
<p>I was in the post office a few weeks ago and a woman literally had a fit when she realized she wasn't wearing a mask.  Started apologizing over and over to the postal worker and those of us in line like she gave us all the plague or something.  I felt bad for her that her brain is so screwed up.</p>

        <p>You don’t even have to ask. The owner has already shown through his actions how important he thinks the masks are. The sign in the window means nothing if it’s required by law.   </p>
<p>I’ve made a game out of it. You have to pay attention, but every once in a while, after seeing you without a mask, someone will take off their own or maybe just pull it down. It’s silly and stupid but also slightly exhilarating when it happens. </p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the employees actually care enough to ask you to wear a mask, just respond with a polite “Absolutely, no problem!” and you are no worse off than you started.</p>

        <p>It's a large problem that is present in I would guess around 70% of the cases in america. Without hospital care some of these overweight cases would turn out worse. I've seen testimonies of survivors that described a long protracted sickness requiring hospitalisation followed by slow painful recoveries. It's hard enough for fat people to exercise, lung diseases are no joke</p>
