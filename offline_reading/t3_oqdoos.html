    <p><p>The reason I use the word oligarchy it's because they are not elites neither top elites. Calling things by their right name helps to understand what we are talking about much better. Oligarchs are present in every nation. They do not provide, neither produce, any value for society. Yet they live off it, like a parasite. They also use the power of the state only and always to favor them.</p>
<p>Macron is the favorite pet of the globalists and he just hit the pedal to floor. Judging by the way he acts and thinks, he's trying to prove his bosses how really good he can be, and is trying to finish first. The date, September 2021, it's not that important. It's just there on the book published by the WHO. But it is the goal. UK is following. Canada and Australia too.</p>
<p>In March of 2019, the WHO put out a book titled <em>A World at Risk</em>. It’s an scenario put together with the hypothesis of “What if there was an accidental or intentional release of a respiratory pathogen”. In there, an universal capacity of crowd control and acceptance of an universal injection mandate must be put in place and completed by September 2020. To not make it so obvious they chose that year instead of 2021.^((1))</p>
<p>So... what's the underlying problem the global oligarchs have that they are trying everyone to get the experimental juice injection? Money is the easy answer, so I'll try to explain it with out being too technical about it.</p>
<p>The fall of the Berlin Wall paved the way to the Washington Consensus, that was held by the social-democrats and neo-liberals. To enter the place, social-democrats used the door on the left and neo-liberals the one on the right. These two political, social, and economic ideas started to be applied on the world, specially in the western hemisphere. You need to understand this in order to understand the following.</p>
<p>Something happened in 2017 that was the starting point to brush off the global oligarch's favorite politics. Imagine this point as the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was when the USA left the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Why? Because after that, the new NAFTA agreement set that the workers in the car industry from Mexico earn the same salary as the American workers. You can’t make this go back and make Mexicans workers accept a salary reduction. This is the starting point to end the globalization.</p>
<p>After receiving this economic help from the USA, Mexico started to fight more seriously the narcs from their side using their Marina (Navy), specially going after the tunnels they use that go across the border. Two neighbors working with each other with out getting their big pointy noses in each others business. This is called nationalism. <a href="https://i.ibb.co/DtS52Rr/1.png">Big bad word the global oligarchy is terrified of</a> and are desperately trying to fight by coming up with the idea that poorer nations won’t have the amount of experimental juice injections they need because of it.^((2))</p>
<p>Neo-liberals and social democrats have a lot in common, but regarding to economics, they share this one thing: the subjective theory of value. What does that means? It means that the value of something you want to buy it's determined by your level of importance to spend money on that thing. Example: Picasso draws a painting and a random person draws another one. The more you want the Picasso drawing the higher the price is. Regarding this type of things there is no major issue, but it is a problem when they apply it to basic needs like food and gas. It’s basically selling it to the best better. Watch what happened to electric bills in Texas recently.</p>
<p>Why they like this subjective theory of value? Because they can have the most amount of profit by doing nothing. That's called speculation. Their problem is that gaining money by speculating is off the table and the world is heading that way. Printing money out of thin air and giving it to people to spend it has its consequences, and they know it thanks to the 2008 crisis.</p>
<p>So in order to live without doing nothing and gain a lot of money in a world that is saying goodbye to speculation and globalization, they need to create endless demand to move money around. The new demand is created by ill people needing treatment^((3)) and others being constantly sick in need of boosters injections^((4)) while at the same time they have the least amount of children^((5)) so the top %1 keeps that way and not less. How is this achieved? With experimental juice injections, mass media brainwash and fraudulent tests.^((6))</p>
<p>They create the problem to sell you the solution. Billy and Georgie just bought a 10 minute test.^((7)) They know it's gonna be used in a lot of venues to enter public places. These quick test give false positive by using soft drink.^((8)) Billy is also testing a contactless and faceless ID technology in Africa. By taking a picture of your hand you are good to go and you will not take off the mask because you need that piece of cloth to stop the deadliest virus in the planet. MasterFraud is working on this project too, trying implement their idea of a cashless world.^((9))</p>
<p>The questions is how do we prevent this sickening? Fight it or get away from it? The politicians are meaningless, the problem is the injected lab rat mob. The rule of the mob is really hard to fight. They are seriously convinced that you are trying to attack and hurt them in some way, and since they are the majority, the dirty politicians are willing to jump to their rescue by applying tyrannic measures as an excuse to get away with their hidden agenda.</p>
<p>I personally suggest to get away from it while you still can and consider places that don't have the capacity to implement this measures. In my last post I talked about Latin America and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The other choice is to fight it. The world is watching the people of France. French bros, it's time to do what you do best.</p>
