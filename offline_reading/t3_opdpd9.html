<p>We're saying "you want the vaccine? Fine, go get it. Leave us alone"</p>
<p>You think that the paper here proves the vaccine is working? You think that you need one? You <em>fucking go get one and leave us alone</em>. That's all we're asking you.</p>

<p>You're also saying all sorts of shit like how the vaccine doesn't work, "no you tell me exactly the method that allows it to reduce the chances of spread" to paraphrase one fine redditor's comment here, how vaccines fAiLed in Israel. How vaccine has a higher cost than benefit (despite the fact that not only does it protect you, it protects others), how herd immunity doesn't work, all that bullshit. </p>
<p>Are you sure that's all you're saying?</p>

        <p>Let's get to it point by point</p>
<p>&rt; The vaccine doesn't work</p>
<p>I hope this is not true. My personal analysis of data from Catalunya and Israel points to that being at least not as true as they claim it to be (so, nowhere close to 80-90% of protection against hospitalization), but time will tell. Again, it's my personal analysis and I use the data I can get my hands on. It's official data, but I can't have the full picture.</p>
<p>&rt; "no you tell me exactly the method that allows it to reduce the chances of spread" </p>
<p>There's no telling exactly, cause there's no method. It doesn't reduce the chances of spread. This is now very clear from Israeil data - the unvaccinated and the vaccinated get infected at the same ratio.</p>
<p>&rt; how vaccines fAiLed in Israel. </p>
<p>The didn't <em>fail</em>. At least, for now - we're in July. We have to wait for September at least to see the impact on mortality. They failed at reducing spread, that we know now.</p>
<p>&rt; How vaccine has a higher cost than benefit (despite the fact that not only does it protect you, it protects others)</p>
<p>It doesn't protect others. Again, this is clear now. It has vastly higher costs than benefits for everyone not morbidly obese or otherwise at risk under at least 40 years old. Probably 60.</p>
<p>&rt; how herd immunity doesn't work</p>
<p>Herd immunity is a <em>state</em> a population is in. How can it not work? Never heard that one around here.</p>

        <p>&rt;There's no telling exactly, cause there's no method. It doesn't reduce the chances of spread. </p>
<p>... Did you read the study above? Or any study at all? Anyway, my point was that when confronted with opposing viewpoints like how vaccines lower chances of spread, people will get all pedantic/disengenuous and act as if just because I don't know, means that it doesn't actually work. It doesn't work like that.</p>
<p>&rt;aeil data - the unvaccinated and the vaccinated get infected at the same ratio.</p>
<p>Many possible reasons for that, like this. https://www.deseret.com/platform/amp/coronavirus/2021/7/20/22584134/whats-going-on-in-israels-outbreak-among-vaccinated-people</p>
<p>But you're gomma brush it off just because its the washington post anyway so why do I even try.</p>
<p>&rt;It doesn't protect others.</p>
<p>It it lowers spreading chances, yes it does.</p>
<p>&rt;It has vastly higher costs than benefits for everyone not morbidly obese or otherwise at risk under at least 40 years old. Probably 60.</p>
<p>Protecting you from death is not a "higher benefit"? Or, since you guys love talking about vaccinw side effects so much, you do know there can also be long term complications with covid right.</p>
<p>&rt;Herd immunity is a state a population is in.</p>
<p>And... you're being pedantic.</p>

        <p>Find it funny that there was a meme just recently all about how you people were more "science" than the others. But look here. You're doing exactly what you accuse the other side of doing. You're discarding the study just because it doesn't fit your narrative.</p>
<p>Also for the Israel example I keep hearing all about: this study was made just today. Don't you think they had considered Israel when posting their findings? The fact that this study corroborates with previous studies about  how vaccine efficacy is 90% is telling. It simply means some other factor caused the data in Israel to have such an anomally. And that's even assuming the data's complete and a full representation of what's happenijg there anyway.</p>
<p>Well I suppose either that or, as you say, the gov has an agenda to make us all slaves. That's why they're pushing vaccines so hard, to condition us into obedience and appreciating our rights being stripped away. They're implementing the great reset! </p>
<p>That's fair. I'll give it that. It just means Occam's razor has failed all of you. </p>

        <p>Israel has been seeing increases in vaccinated individuals getting covid for over a month now. Keep in mind they were the first to have the vaccine administered throughout the population (besides the Haredi community obviously…I guess they’re the control group other than the fact they have lots of genetic issues as a population vs the rest) so anything you’re seeing in Israel is because they’re the first to roll out en masse.</p>
<p>But really…you didn’t post this study to help inform or to add discussion based on your defensive tone….but rather as a means to ‘discredit’. Which is intellectually dishonest approach IMO especially since this study just tests for covid in the nasal cavities.</p>
<p>I don’t think people on this sub (especially myself) don’t think the vaccines ‘work’…many drugs work but have unintended consequences.</p>
<p>We all fear the unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Every drug in history would have been pulled from market by now given all these side effects and volume of them. That’s a fact since no other drug has had over 10k deaths worldwide and still in market, let alone just in one country…</p>

        <p>Well firstly if my country does mandate it, I'm sure those who actually can't take it will be exempted. This leaves those unwilling. In this case, yes I am happy about that because it's time to stop being dragged into lockdowns with those selfish bitches for once.</p>

        <p>Then lying, like murder, should get the death penalty, because it's an act of violence against morality. Or even acting selfishly, to, say, protect yourself instead of think about others. That should get the death penalty too.</p>
<p>Have you never heard of false equivalence?</p>

        <p>The only differences is your certainty you are right allows you to mentally excuse your crimes against others at this moment.  You are willing to be atrocious because you believe it is for the greater good.  History might yet prove you wrong and you will be a monster forever because you willingly cast aside integrity of a person's body for a sliver of safety against a comparably low threat virus.  The reason you did this is because you have lived in a time where you never had to experience hardship at a level most humans did, so the first time you realized there was a 0.05% chance of death you couldn't handle it</p>

To add never trust the government or big pharma, especially since this is a “rushed” vaxx with not serious long term testing and a massive wave of political propaganda behind it.</p>
