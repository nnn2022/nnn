        <p>That's their plan. A world full of robots that can be reprogrammed any second. Just like when they reprogrammed the masses overnight in March, but it's gonna be even easier, because the new sets of robots won't even push back or question it. Free thinkers are a dying breed.</p>

        <p>It will never go away. That’s the thing. It’s <em>everywhere</em>, it’s insanely transmissible, and we need to learn how to deal with that unfortunate reality. Masks and social distancing can only slow it, not stop it.</p>
<p>All that talk early on about “flattening the curve” tacitly implied and understood that the spread was inevitable, and our goal was to prevent it from swamping our health care response. At no point was anyone bafflingly stupid enough to suggest that it would go away entirely. It’s incredible how the goalposts have now moved to that literal impossibility.</p>

        <p>I just don't get it.  They scream about freedom and liberty but those two ideals are nothing without civic responsibility.  I owe my neighbor some very basic duties even as a free citizen.  If this crisis was anymore serious it would be the end of the nation, because if you won't put on a mask for me, then how could I expect you to make the kind of sacrifices our grandparents made for each other to fight fascism.</p>

<p>You are making your own prison, blaming the tiny minority of us in here for the problems you have created, when 99% of people are useless sheep like you and comply anyway. Even with 99% compliance, has it helped?  No, it is damaging and destructive.

<p>If people had taken this seriously from the start rather than railing against some perceived government takeover and batching about how masks prevent them from breathing (which at this point just makes me laugh) we wouldn't be talking about this as a new normal.  But no, you sit there and think you are fighting oppression while your actions actually create the need for the very oppression you oppose.  You aren't some genius visionary that sees things the rest of us don't, you're just a selfish child with an echo chamber of equally ignorant children ruining things for the rest of us.  I hope someday you realize the harm you have caused your fellow citizens but I expect that would exceed the capacity of your five brain cells.  Kindly go fuck yourself.</p>

        <p>How does that make a person a terrorist?</p>
<p>From Merriam-Webster dictionary</p>
<p>terrorist: noun</p>
<p>: an advocate or practitioner of terrorism as a means of coercion </p>
<p>terrorism: noun</p>
<p>: the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion</p>
<p>Seems the mainstream media are the terrorists, by definition...</p>

<p>1 person was outright killed. She was shot by a murderous cop.</p>
<p>1 cop died days later. Medical examiners have CONFIRMED that it was not due to blunt force trauma.</p>
<p>Two other died of natural causes and one died in an apparent 'crushing' incident, whatever that means.</p>

        <p>So you sacrificed and you're upset people aren't as (pietous) <em>pious</em> as you? You are literally the opposite of Jesus, where you want recognition and praise for every act you do and are spiteful to those that don't follow your example. Hubris much?</p>

        <p>Yes you do owe your neighbor basic duties, it’s just not the governments place to enforce them.  The fact that you realize this “crisis” isn’t more serious should tell you everything you need to know.  If it was more serious people would take it seriously, but it’s not that serious for anyone that isn’t either A. Morbidly obese, or B. Older than 80.</p>

        <p>Without the freedom to give and liberty to help others, there is no "civic responsibilty." Without the hundreds of millions of people who buy and use computers, there is no Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Now our governments are reaping the harvest of this totalitarian control, with millions in lost tax revenue, faith-based charities and other philanthropic groups without the ability to fundraise, and the needy growing in number daily.</p>
<p>But sure, we who want the freedom to earn our living and attend church, to gather in our communities and in our various civic groups, we are the problem.</p>

        <p>My grandparents did not actually make sacrifices to fight fascism. All that shiny ideals stuff doesn't mean a lot when you're literally malnourished working class, and the aristos are going to make you fight/work for their interests anyway. Having heard the real story, there's no way I'd fall for that trick, especially not from cut-price Churchill here.</p>

<p>None of that should matter.  I know it's the reality, but look.  I don't care.  Sure it isn't right, but the real issue is that they're in power and they have it all.  all the resources, all the planet, everything, and they don't like to share.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter who the people are or what they look like that's doing this to the rest.  It's wrong and should stop and there has to be a better way for everyone.</p>

        <p>It wouldn't matter who they were in terms of it being morally wrong, that's absolutely true, but it is useful in terms of helping to explain the dynamics. In the UK context, it really does look patriarchal with much of the ruling cabal, who don't appreciate/care how bitter the time lost is for women in their thirties like me, and as well as everything else they're doing to them, would probably cheerfully send young working class lads to get shot at once again - after all patriarchy is most specifically that rule of older and established, higher-status, men.</p>

        <p>I've seen them suggest the <em>expectation</em> that people <em>should/must</em> have nuclear families is racist, not that nuclear families themselves literally are. I'd have said it's 'anachronistic' first, maybe 'xenophobic' second, but they still have a point. It's just plain not some universally accurate assumption, particularly when the nuclear family unit is imagined in isolation/as separable from wider community, which is part of the issue with loneliness under lockdown we're having now. I think the over-emphasis on such families and the casual assumption from comfortable, well-off, politicians we all have that has made this situation worse.</p>

<p>Why non-fox? I mean not only has that writer had articles on Fox News (including the one you linked), but this website seems just as conservative leaning lol.</p>
<p>Also, I asked for a source of a big institution calling nuclear families racist, not some random woman with 30 likes on Twitter who nobody has ever heard of. In fact, in the 30 seconds I tried to do more research into her arguments to try and understand her stance, I only found conservative sources (dailymail, nypost, fox news, etc.), which shows pretty clearly what she is: literally just some random yahoo that conservative media puts on a pedestal in order to scare their viewers into returning to their platform.</p>

        <p>This is why we sheltered for about 8 weeks in March - May but then that was it.  Our family collectively made the decision that seeing grandma and grandpa was important and worth the risk.   So was seeing other kids at the playground. 
I am sure those that have held out this whole time are stronger willed than me. Good for them.  I think the mental consequences going forward are going to be severe and it’s going to be a mystery why to some people.</p>

        <p>What I am seeing here is much like you described. People stayed in for about 6 to 8 weeks. By Mother’s Day last year, parks had barriers torn down and people were outside. Around that time, I think all of the parents in my kid’s social circle collectively said “screw it” and let them have their lives back. I personally don’t know very many people who are still staying locked down. That’s with Newsom’s tyranny, so there are pockets of sanity out here on the west coast.</p>

        <p>Similar! Mkids have been seeing my parents. My MIL refuses to have much contact (I think we've seen her 5 times since March, comparatively to weekly Sunday dinners) so my kids, especially the older one, know my family more. I've stopped feeling guilty since MIL is a grown woman capable of making her own decisions.</p>
<p>As for seeing other kids, most people my age (30s) are so full of virtue signaling bullshit that it's nearly impossible for my kids to interact with other kids 😭</p>

        <p>Glad your kids get to see your parents...as a mother of two grown sons that spent their entirely lives growing up with both sets of grandparents until their passings in recent years, I can tell u it can be a wonderful bond for many and was for us.  You have no control over your MIL, just be grateful they have your parents and unfortunately for your MIL she misses out.  Family and friend in person  interaction is vital to the spiritual mental and physical health of both the young and old and enough is enough. I’ll keep good thoughts that your MIL comes around.  Nothing like a hug.  Just wear the mask in the words of Lord Fauci</p>

        <p>I'm glad I live in a place that's mostly sane. We do have some restrictions, and some doomer around. There is still a mask mandate, but restaurants and bars are open (the clubs are open, but they won't let you dance 😒). I went to a restaurant yesterday for lunch with co-workers, and it was 100% full.</p>
<p>This week I'm moving one county over, and there are even fewer restrictions. No mask mandate, no capacity restrictions, and you can even dance in the clubs with no masks. It's like I'm getting in a time machine and going back to 2019. So still shitty ha, but no lockdown.</p>

        <p>That’s the nonsensical part of the argument:  if we stay within our little bubble and masks are so awesome, there really shouldn’t be much of a risk to us or those around us on the rare occasion we go out in public. </p>
<p>Otherwise, yeah, I’ll own up to it. There is always going to be risk and I don’t think absolutely shredding the relationship between my kids and their grandparents and going through that mental crucible is an appropriate response.  It simply is not.  Endless Skype calls may be fine for some but I would venture to say that’s not the way most people are behaving. You’ll certainly believe that’s the problem but then I’d counter and say policies that have been in place since we took the cap off have found our activities to be permitted.  </p>
<p>I think people are living in fantasy land if they think that true social distances make up any more than 20% of the population.  People want this to be an all or nothing approach where having a visit with grandma is on par with partying at a bar.  That’s nonsense and it’s why people tune out the advice.  You can’t boil life down to covid avoidance, especially when we’re being told oh it could last until spring, no summer, nah let’s go with 2022, nah now it’s summer again, wait it’s 2022 because you’re all awful people and not sheltering in place.</p>

        <p>You know this is exactly what New Zealand did <em>not</em> do and now they're living healthy normal lives. Because they actually followed the recommendations and their government actually provided for their people. Good thing they were stronger willed than you.</p>

        <p>Because they locked down everything right when they had very few cases. New Zealand is one of the most isolated countries in the world, they have no land borders. I mean they're so isolated that there's even a subreddit dedicated to maps without New Zealand. You can't compare NZ or even OZ with let's say the Netherlands for example. What works for isolated islands won't work for the Rhine area in Europe since density is much higher and there are several countries connected to each other with countless roads &amp; means of transportations and no border checks...</p>

        <p>You're right, New Zealand has an advantage being an island. Doesnt mean they still didn't better follow healthier standards, leading to better results quicker. People still go in and out of the country, but they have rules that people listen to, which is the main reason they have a 0.00000006% daily infection rate, while the US for example had a 0.000076% daily infection rate last month. Thousands of times worse.</p>

        <p>It's not about saving people it never was. It's about virtue signalling and control. Say there was a fire drill at a school and instead of letting the kids back in some of the teachers would rather the kids get hypothermia just in case there was a real fire in the school, even after the firefighters cleared the building. That's where were at.</p>

        <p>Also they completely ignore the fact that lockdowns kill.   Save one person from covid but someone else just committed suicide from lockdown and someone else just missed catching stage 4 cancer. Since they were too scared to leave the house and go to the doctor. So technically they killed one and their "saved" person probably died from an underlying condition that they listed it as a covid death.</p>

        <p>Often times the life saved is someone who has lived a full life, is chronically ill, and sometimes in solitary confinement in a nursing home, and you lose a previously happy child with their whole life ahead of them. </p>
<p>I know someone's gonna say I want the elderly to die...  No, I don't <strong>want</strong> anyone to die, but people die. If those at the greatest risk are locked down/sheltering in place there's no good reason for those at little to no risk to do the same</p>
<p>It's sad when anyone dies, but when a person who has lived a full life, and often times is chronically ill it's just that, sad. <em>I dare say most elderly wouldn't ask us to sacrifice the next generation so they can have a little bit more time.</em></p>
<p>But when a child takes their own life it's a fucking tragedy. For their family, friends, teachers, classmates, etc... </p>

        <p>No death is not okay. People shouldn't be allowed to leave their house, people should not be allowed to drive cars because accidents can happen. People shouldn't be allowed to go from place to place because that's dangerous. In fact, people shouldn't be allowed to eat anything that can be undercooked or choked on, a lot of people die due to choking on stuff or from salmonella. People shouldn't be allowed to go outside because they could be hit by thunderbolts. People shouldn't install furniture because they could get crushed. Also, people die from the flu, so we should not interact with other people and we should be forced into a literal plastic bubble for all of our lives.</p>
<p>Does that sound good? I know it does for me.</p>

        <p>Driving analogies don't work though, they aren't transmissible like a virus, the don't mutate like a virus, people who drive don't have around a 2% chance of dying in a given driven etc etc etc. The lifetime risk of dying in a car accident is less than the mortality rate of catching Covid. </p>
<p>Although if you want to keep going with the bad driving analogies, people in this sub would have been against seatbelts when they were first made compulsory in cars, a very fringe opinion today.</p>

<p>No, I'm perfectly aware of that attitude. I'm calling people selfish assholes because I am very much aware of their attitude and flawed logic, not because I have my fingers in my ears.</p>

        <p>The people that allowed it to happen are the ones who continue to go out to restaurants and bars, and their friends’ houses and refuse to follow guidelines like wearing a mask and distancing. You dumb fucks are prolonging this because you lack critical thinking skills, compassion, and the ability to think more than four seconds ahead.</p>

        <p>We lack critical thinking? Given your spouting the mainstream narrative that everyone is a threat / shit yourself when you go outside / distance yourselves from your own family rather than being a fcking human being like you were in 2019? You're the dumb fuck here sweetheart</p>

<p>~~And Canada IS letting China use on old unused military base for "cold weather training."~~ </p>
<p>Justin Trudeau invited China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to send its troops for cold weather training at CFB Petawawa in Ontario — and Trudeau raged at the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) for cancelling the training after China kidnapped Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.</p>

        <p>I agree it’s cringe worthy but my feeling there’s so much of this out there.  Ie. “Oppositional Defiance Disorder” aka ODD aka “I’m a shit parent” it’s hard to take this stuff seriously.  </p>
<p>People want labels because it makes them feel special  and gives them excuses for their behavior. When I was In grade school I knew exactly 0 people with ADD/HADD. Now  sure there were some and it wasn’t diagnosed but for this number to be quadruple the number it was 30 years ago seems just like labeling and medicating. </p>
<p>Is it just a coincidence that this rate has grown so much in combination with firmer disciple  has gone out of style?  Now before someone gets their panties wadded ( not saying op to whom I responding to) discipline is not beating the shit out of your kid. It’s controlling and being a parent.</p>

<p>Its literally $12 and that's pretty close to free but I don't think you should be able to buy an amphetamine OTC without an RX.</p>

        <p>It'll be a requirement for the future to be happy sitting  in your house being fed via drone. The only people i talk to now is people on reddit. Seriously, cut all mt friends off. Deleted and blocked all numbers. Facebook not deactivated, but deleted. I communicate with reddit and occasionally my weed dealer who actually loves a chat now more than ever. We waffled for 40mins once and we're not even friends so everyone is suffering. I've had enough. Health passort controlled tyranny? Quite frankly i would rather put a rope around my neck and call it a day then deal with this for lifetime. They say its ending in the UK and i KNOW there's more. I can feel them lying to me and i can it in their fucking eyes. More is coming and it's distressing. I haven't read a book in 6 months. I lay around my house jusylt scanning the fucking TV. This is horrificm last night i was pumped at 3am not able to sleep and thw universe just said get your fucking arse in the rain and walk, walk as fast as you can in the rain until you lungs burn. I feel much better today because it as thw wonderful silence of the night and no cars on the road. No masks and i alsot felt normal. </p>
<p>Walking is a mans best medicine, we should be walking on mass to the politic elite and be dragging them out into thw street and flogging them for what they're doing. Anyway, fuckign covid, fuck your vaccine you bunch of satanist. I see you cunts, i feel you presence around me. I'm waiting</p>

        <p>This is what pisses me off the most, these poor fucking kids with scared parents.</p>
<p>Saw a post on parenting about a Doomer parent who hadn't let her 8 year old out to play with any of his friends for like 5 months straight.</p>
<p>She was complaining about how, "other people" were letting their kids ride bikes and how they aren't taking this seriously enough and if they would just also lock themselves in their room we could get back to normal.</p>
<p>Locking a child in your home for 5 months is fucking child abuse.</p>
<p>This year has been one full of play dates, no crowds at the zoo, family time with cousins and grandparents, long walks of exploration at the beach, lazy days sitting in the sun, and parks everyday. </p>
<p>We really missed story time at the library so i took to our neighborhood FB page and asked if anyone wanted to get together for outside story time. Now once a week about 6 or 7 of us show up with a blue tooth speaker, put on some dumb kid music and live our lives. </p>
<p>I have a love/hate relationship with this pandemic,  but it's really been a wonderful year raising our baby together.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Some things kids can’t do because things are closed, but don’t use restrictions as an excuse to not do things. This irritates me as much as virtue signaling. My kids eat out, play with the neighbors, visit grandparents. If grandparents won’t let you visit, find someone else to visit.
Edit to add it looks like this is from Scotland. I think they still have restaurants closed so other things are probably closed too. But still visit friends. Visit family. Go wherever you can.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is no choice. I live in an area where it seems everyone is a paranoid lunatic over the virus. And yes, before some moron here chimes in with "LOL BUT THEN JUST TALK TO OTHERS, YOU'LL SEE EVERYONE IS SECRETLY FED UP!" I have. Nearly everyone I've spoken to has been terrified. I see masked kids all the time here, too. I even saw a toddler in a stroller covered in a plastic bubble a few days ago. I wish I was kidding. It's probably rough for many parents against the new normal to find non-familial playmates for their kids.</p>

        <p>I’m sure it also depends on which country you live in. Even what state or city. Most things here are open. I’m sure that makes people feel better about having people in their homes. If everything is still closed then that feeds the fear.</p>

        <p>I have a four month old daughter and I think about this constantly. She’s still full on baby so doesn’t have a clue what’s going on, but I see lockdown enthusiasts use their kids constantly in these forums. They say things like “selfishly I want my kids to have a normal life, but we’re following the rules to protect those who are vulnerable, blah, blah, blah...”</p>
<p>I will NEVER let covid fuck up my kids life. Can you believe that? Parent after parent on here admitting to raising their kids in harmful ways? Seriously wtf? </p>
<p>If lockdowns remain or get even worse, I’ll be ready. I’m like one of those preppers with a bunker, only lockdowns are my apocalypse. I have two Phil degrees, one CS degree, classically trained on the piano (I own a standup and a keyboard), played competitive sports my entire life, traveled all over, speak Japanese and French, and have enough saved up to focus less on work in order to provide a homeschooled education for my kid. </p>
<p>Sorry for boasting. That’s not my intention. If you have kids, it’s your responsibility to raise them. Don’t use them to win arguments with crazy people on Reddit.. and do whatever you can to give them the best life you can. They deserve it.</p>

<p>I hate that reasoning so much. Why should children lose opportunities bc a 92 year old might die of covid? Many people 80 and up have varying levels of physical ailments and dementia. </p>
<p>We would have to lockdown permanently to 'save' the immunocompromised, elderly, or whoever.</p>

        <p>No, we live in the real world. People get old and die. My great grandpa was old and died of dementia. His wife had a weak heart, advanced diabetes, and died. Old people will naturally die bc that's what happens. Death has been happening well before Cv19. If I were old, I wouldn't want young people to lose out on their lives just bc I'm at the end of mine. </p>
<p>I'm convinced that many adults need to have someone sit down with them and talk about death the same way we talk to children about sex. </p>
<p>What will you call me this time? A granny hater? Granny killer? Tell me to die on a ventilator? I'm curious, go for it.</p>

        <p>So what about the young people with illnesses that put them at risk of dying from covid? People who have lung problems or weaker immune systems? I just came in here from r/all and I'm not sure what to make of it all, but going by the comments it seems like people are heavily implying only the very old die from the virus? It's absolutely killed young people who wouldn't have died otherwise.</p>

        <p>I'm really lucky to be living in one of the few countries where a lockdown actually worked and life more or less went back to how it was pre-covid. I can't imagine what's its been like to have a long lockdown so I'm not here to argue about whether it's good or bad. I just think it's really disingenuous to imply that it only kills 90-year old people on their deathbeds.</p>

        <p>I don't think any one of you actually addressed what I said in my comment. You honestly all sound like emotionally charged irrational people getting upset at the slightest deviation from your little echo chamber.
I live in a country where we had a short lockdown, the virus was gone, and life went on as normal. Maybe that's unacceptable to you but I thought it went well. I don't agree with these long, depressing, socially damaging lockdowns. I don't agree with people being alone without face to face contact for a year. My own gran, who lives in our home country, has been alone for nearly a year now and is terribly depressed because of it. I think it's horrific but you've all assumed I'm 100% pro lockdown because you read into my comment what you wanted to read. My whole issue was with how disingenuous it is to only be talking about the deaths of very old people, because they were going to die soon anyway. My partner is in his 20's, lives a normal life but has a history of pneumonia so I really hate when people talk about his life like its expendable.</p>

        <p>Except I already explained the death of young people doesn’t discredit my argument, It discredits yours.</p>
<p>children with weakened immune system‘s and people with pre-existing conditions have always been vulnerable to a variety of different viruses and pathogen‘s that have come and gone throughout the years.</p>
<p>As I previously stated your average flu will take a couple hundred children with those issues every fucking year and I don’t see any of you complaining about it or treating it as a big issue.</p>
<p>Its not about whether you’re old or young, it’s about how much of the burden it’s acceptable of you to lay on society (the rest of us) for your safety. When doing so interferes with my ability to live my life and for others to function and run their businesses and go to their jobs and see their family and friends, it’s a fucking problem. </p>
<p>it’s unacceptable in my opinion.</p>
<p>In any decent country with a good constitution, it’s illegal to compel me to do that.</p>

        <p>You're the one who said it...Glad my 83 year old mother with end stage Alzheimer's is comfortable and well taken care of by aides (and family members) who are willing to wear masks and stay away for a while when they get covid or the cold/flu.  The aides get to keep a good paying job in a relatively safe environment, I get to spend time with my mother, and she is not dying a painful death alone in a hospital.</p>

        <p>That's what we've been saying for like a year- if you're sick, be careful around the elderly, and stay away from them if you can. You are acting like we said people should actively infect granny! No one is advocating that old people should die alone. My great grandfather died years ago, and myself and other family members were at the hospital with him.</p>

        <p>My grandpa is 81 and wants to live what's left of his life, even if he gets sick and dies. We have to physically keep him home sometimes.  Hes never tried to make me stop living my life, same for any of his grandchildren. </p>
<p>Omg what? Even if someone feels like they're young, it doesnt make it true. Just bc someone feels a certain way or self identifies in a certain way, doesnt make it true. 
Btw a friend of mine mother in law was 99 and begging to die. Some of them barely know what city they're in bc of their dementia. </p>
<p>Old people are not expendable, but also they dont live forever. You act like 2 year olds are actively trying to catch Rona and give it to their grandparents! If we were trying to keep old people from getting sick and die, we would need to permanently lock down. There is always something out there that can kill someone.</p>

        <p>No matter the context in society it should always be the elderly who sacrifice before children and adolescents. </p>
<p>The only exception we generally have to that dynamic is war and throwing young men into conflict to die on the battlefield.</p>
<p>that’s just simple ethics, children’s lives should not be put on hold to their detriment to protect those who have the agency and ability to self isolate themselves and take necessary precautions.</p>
<p>You can do it during flu season without holding children’s lives hostage and you can do it now because the rest of society is rapidly getting fed up waiting.</p>
<p>It is not the responsibility of the young to sacrifice the quality of their lives so the old can get a few more years at the end of their’s. Especially young children who need social interaction for healthy development. </p>
<p>So in reality you’re the one who is an asshole. Because you’re the one who sees no problem with an entire generation of children who are emotionally and socially stunted after an entire year or two of their developmental life is taken from them.</p>
<p>And you call us insane?</p>

        <p>Because the developmental health of children is more important than old people. how many different ways does it have to be expressed that especially young children NEED those interactions to grow. </p>
<p>Stunting them developmentally is asking them to sacrifice the quality of their life. And if Dr. Fauci is to be believed then this should continue into 2022 for another year.</p>
<p>Those with comorbidities and high-risk can take matters into their own hands and isolate. Children are the lowest risk group for this virus and children should be able to go to school and interact with their peers and have as normal a childhood as possible. </p>
<p>Any truly good and sane society protects children above all others.</p>
<p>If you can’t understand that, it’s clear that you’re too stupid to understand basic developmental psychology. Children are the future, not the elderly and infirm.</p>

        <p>More than 1000 children died the year before last from the average flu strain. They all had medical conditions and other issues that made them uniquely vulnerable to the virus and yet society didn’t lock down to protect them.</p>
<p>Thats what you and others are failing to understand. People die every year from preventable diseases but you can’t ask society to lock down for your benefit.</p>
<p>You certainly can’t bitch about needless deaths when I’ve already demonstrated that you don’t actually care. If you did then you would’ve taken every flu season just as seriously as you do Covid.</p>

        <p>How have you demonstrated i dont care? You know flu shot are a thing, and staying home while sick to not transfer. And to not being able to restrict your movement for others safety, what do you think traffic lights are or crosswalks. You may of reached a new level of smooth brain, flat brain. Also its funny how you don't see how your rhetoric also killed those kids, because your precious movement. Finally I find it great you keep trying to make this personal and have it be about your movement and my safety when the issue at hand is vulnerable elders and sub optimal opportunities for children. I'll continue to do what I can to keep you safe friend! Much love.</p>

        <p>My kid's in the same boat. But it is encouraging to see whenever he is around other children, he quickly adapts and his social interactions seem to show up so naturally. What's key here is not wearing a mask so your children can learn facial expressions with voice tones and body language all at the same time.</p>

        <p>I have a niece and 3 nephews age ranges from 6 to 2. Grandma is babysitter for two of them twice a week and sees the other two at least once a month, sometimes more. My mother thinks the relationship more important than the risk and it shows in the kids' behavior and development. They get to do things with grandma and talk to adults outside their parents and I think it helps development, plus grandma and grandpa have a swing set and slides in the backyard.</p>

My daughter regularly goes on errands with me, she sees my family, I took her the playground even when they were technically closed for several months and she's enrolled in gymnastics classes. BUT to be fair, the person who tweeted this may live in a place where doing anything fun with her kid is impossible.</p>

        <p>Cancel the lockdowns! Stop wearing masks! Stop conforming! Make it a point to look down on people in public wearing masks and acting like idiots trying to maintain “social distancing” what a freakin joke. Gather in groups and do this, strength in numbers!

        <p>I have a 1 and 3 year old. I can also relate majorly. </p>
<p>If I didn't have kids I'd be less angry about the lockdowns. I got to WFH for a year in exchange for giving up restaurants and large events. Not a terrible trade off. </p>
<p>But kids lives are literally being destroyed over this. Ages 2-4 are the prime socialization period of one's life and if you fall behind in these years it is often impossible to ever catch up.</p>

        <p>I swear, I cry myself to sleep some nights because my little sister can’t experience the life that I did. This can’t be good for her mental health. Online school has caused her to be illiterate. She can’t even read the title of a book, she is more than halfway through grade one. And doesn’t know what sound vowels make. This wouldn’t be that way if she had went to school. But nope, my ‘woke’ older sister is too paranoid she’ll get this virus that has proven to be no worse than the flu, and my mom is a government compliant bot. Some days, my little sister goes almost the whole day without taking her eyes off a screen. Be it online school, or watching shows that isn’t helping her illiteracy at all. And my mom doesn’t do shit, nor does she let me do jack shit. Because, you know ‘The greater good’. Yeah, I’m pissed. I’m 16, should be going into 12th grade next fall. I said fuck it when the pandemic began and I’m still halfway through tenth grade because fuck at home school. I just want to learn and interact with people, is that too hard to ask?</p>

        <p>As much as I agree, I also have a two year old who’s life has not been affected. We started play groups early in life, so though we’ve missed them for the last year they aren’t totally foreign. We have a group of friends who also question lockdowns and see sees her two friends at least once or twice a week. She’s never worn a mask and never will. We’ve fought the cold weather and gone to playgrounds and parks, etc. She has a close relationship with her grandparents because they value their time with her and believe it’s worth the risk of getting Covid. Its doable.</p>

YOU can take them to see Grandma and Grandpa, YOU can arrange playdates with other kids in your home, stop being lazy and take responsibility for YOUR OWN failures.

        <p>I am sorry but as a parent **I BLAME YOU** </p>
<p>My ex-wife and I force our son into  play dates with like minded parents WITHOUT face masks.  We are anti-vaxxers so we have huge support group. Even if you are not an anti-vaxxer you can find like minded parents through meetup website in your local area. Just look for organizations of kids and parents and play groups. . A lot of parents are REBELLING against this nonsense  like you wouldnt believe</p>
<p>My son attends a language school on the weekends to learn Italian and German, also no face masks (non American teachers - so SENSIBLE and not paranoid). </p>
<p>Tomorrow I am going to pick him up and take him to one of our favorite state parks where he will run around and play with a mix of kids (with or without face masks). He and I will not be wearing it - because we NEVER wear that nonsense outside - the very notion is stupidity INCARNATE</p>

        <p>Looks like this post has been brigaded...a few comments</p>
<p>1) So many people saying that it’s better than dying of COVID which is fucking ridiculous as it’s literally less fatal than flu for kids and the death rate is minuscule for the average age of a parent with a young child.</p>
<p>2) ‘If everyone wore masks and listened this would be over’ is the biggest load of shit I’ve heard. Here in the UK face mask compliance is high, I don’t see anyone shopping without one (and I wear one too, my opinions on face masks are neutral), yet we’re one of the worst affected countries. Maybe it’s still around because it’s a highly infectious virus, rather than that a few people haven’t wore masks?</p>

        <p>I just want to say though that this is partially this mom's fault. We never stopped seeing our parents and I never stopped scheduling playdates and auntie dates for my daughter. We never stopped going to the park and the zoo and all the other places.</p>

        <p>Sweet jesus. You have more time with your kid. During their developmental stages. </p>
<p>You may hate to hear this....but you might be a bad parent if you can't figure out how to socialize your children. Books are free online.</p>
<p>It's not hard to allow kids to have fun with dorky things. Id say anger and frustration may show a young kid a bad precedent. If the majority of this sub talks in frustrated tones for hours at home the way they do here, I'm sure their kids may never come back from it....</p>
<p>If their parents choose to make choices to be positive in front of them, say positive words, play games...well their life will not suffer and may be better for it. It's quite possible your kid is suffering because you aren't willing to read free books online and learn how to play "dots" on napkin. Play checkers for free. Giggle and make stupid dad jokes and laugh in front of them.</p>
<p>If your kid is suffering from a lockdown, you have choices. You have someone depending on you. Do the right thing. Learn.</p>

        <p>this doesn't constitute childhood. i spent most of my life like this and it wasn't because anyone told me, it was because i didn't want to. i went outside with just my parents, and when i was old enough, i went out by myself all the time, if i wanted to. i did not and will not have any relationship with cousins or grandparents, because i found them to be unpleasant. and if going out is really so important, then go out, just not around people. sure i have some social anxiety but this was well before any sort of quarantine. any complaints you may have isn't about the children's safety, it's about YOU, and what YOU want for the kid.</p>

        <p>What happens if she gets sick from visiting her friends then goes to visit her grandparents and get them sick? It's unfortunate, but we take the small sacrifices now such as missed opportunities to spend time with each other, so that spending time with each other is an actual possibility in the future. Can't visit people or establish relationships with people if they're dead.</p>

        <p>Well than that's unfortunate. However, you have no way to predict that, but you can know for sure that by visiting them you'll just be increasing their risk. </p>
<p>I've had to put off visiting my grandparents this entire pandemic as well. I work at a grocery store and as such I'm in constant contact with people who don't wear their masks, scratch their face, sneeze over the registers, allow their kids to run around and touch every item on the shelf. I'm in a high risk job and while the chances of me contracting it just before visiting my grandparents are low, it's not worth the risk. I can't justify that short visit when there's the possibility I could end up getting them sick and they die. It's true they could end up getting sick and dying anyways, but that doesn't mean my efforts were for nothing. What matters is doing what we can to keep others healthy and alive, it makes no sense to just throw that out the window because "they might die anyways".</p>

<p>There is no Covid - there is NO SUCH thing. It has NEVER been isolated and the PCR test generates FALSE positives </p>

<p>Herd immunity is only possible through natural exposure - given that this flu derivative has a 99.9% survival rate. 
Vaccinated still contract and transmit the very illnesses they were vaccinated against. Research "Viral Shedding" and "Booster Shots". Also go look at the THOUSANDS of VAERS reports for Covid Vaccines - lots of auto immune disorders and death </p>
<p>You can take that b.s vaccine but no member of family and friend will<br>

        <p>The damage of lockdown and limited contact is absolutely real. However, this risks a parent contracting the virus and possibly dying from it. The loss of a parent during critical mental development stages would be far more damaging than quarantine could ever be.</p>

        <p>To say that the chance of dying of Covid is infinitesimally small, meaning a chance approaching zero, is a very dangerous and ignorant thing. I’m not saying the damage of isolation aren’t real. They absolutely are. I’m saying that losing one or both of your parents, which there is a considerable chance of, has much more potential of damage.</p>

<p>Using your same logic, the logic of being afraid of even things with an infinitesimally small chance of occurring, you should never leave your house. After all, you could get hit by a bus, but never mind that, YOU COULD GET STRUCK BY LIGHTENING! <em>Think of the children!</em></p>

        <p>In <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">this article from the cdc</a>, it is shown that approximately 188,500 people between the ages of 25 and 45 have died of COVID in America. Certainly, a considerable amount of the people in that range are parents. In the article you have linked, a 0.007% chance of death is given in the age range of 20-49, or seven in every thousand cases. Meanwhile, the chance of getting struck by lightning is 1 in 500,000. A parent dying is not incredibly rare. The math says otherwise.</p>

        <p>No? The website from the CDC does indeed say .007%. And as I said before, .007% is the same as 7 out of 100k.</p>

        <p>Alright, then why does the CDC not say there have been ~2000 deaths? If the chances are that low, what gives? I know that the other age groups, particularly the older ones add many more deaths, but I can’t see the 2.8% making a difference of nearly 492,000 to the total</p>

        <p>They could have closed borders, quarantined those who were sick way better, provided better information, etc. none of that actually locks you in your home as a healthy consenting adult. There are other actions that could have stopped it from spreading.

        <p>Agreed. Also, I personally don’t like Trump at all and I’ll leave it at that, but to be fair he was the one trying to close the border back in February but Democrats called him racist instead and said “come join us here in Chinatown”.</p>

        <p>Right, but you refuse to wear masks for the safety of others, 500,000 people are dead in the USA ALONE, do you think those kids are going to miss their parents? Or their Grandparents? Not to mention those children that lost friends because they did grow up before a pandemic. Your argument for "no new normal" is as idiotic as the anti-vaccers and flat earthers. If you don't want to be compared to that idiocy? Perhaps wear a mask, understand it isn't all about just you and your personal interactions and understand that there are other humans in the world that DON'T want to lose their parents, children, or grandparents.</p>

        <p>Do you seriously believe that wearing a mask is so difficult that you would prefer to kill some child's parent or grandparent? Or, somehow, that 500,000 American lives (mind you that's almost HALF of all people killed during EVERY war the USA has been involved in since 1778), aren't worth the respect that you would show to your parents or siblings?

        <p>The death rates in civilized countries, you know, ostensibly like the USA, are quite well recorded. We've had an unaccounted increase in deaths in the USA vs. many previous years (including adjustment for age differentials during given years, and causes of death.) HOWEVER, we're showing 478,927 deaths and 594,294 so I'm more than willing to believe a number of 500K. How inconsiderate can you be? Really a 9/11 every day isn't something to worry about?

        <p>Community transmission of COVID-19 was first detected in the United States in February 2020. By mid-March, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, New York City, and four U.S. territories had reported cases of COVID-19. Since then we have over 500K deaths over expected normal causes (and we've been tracking those figures for a long time, it's what helps us find outbreaks in such things as most STDs, serious alterations to the flu virus: like the swine influenza versions, and others. We're not at March yet. So that's 500K deaths that we don't have anything to account for it, except Covid19, so if you have other data, please share it with the rest of the scientific communities. Covid has an infection rate as high as 3.1% whearas the common flu has an infection rate of 0.1%.

        <p>“Infection rate” and “mortality rate” are not the same thing. Not even close. And you’re sticking to your guns on that 500k number despite car accident deaths and heart attacks of people with several comorbities being included in that figure, so for both of our sakes, I’m done with this conversation. To me, all I hear are the sounds of a wooly livestock animal that grazes in fields.</p>

        <p>Car accidents and heart attacks are included in average deaths per year, this is 500K OUTSIDE of increased totals for all other factors. Also, you're welcome, it was often the livestock that warned the humans of serious environmental issues that could harm them. You refusing to see numbers and statistics is a factor of your ignorance, not your intelligence. Also, your complete inability to empathize with others that ARE losing their families is the height of selfishness.</p>

        <p>You're welcome to not believe, that's your right. However, there is more than enough scientific proof for what I've stated (as well as far greater scientific figures describing the same). So neither I, nor the rest of reality, cares what your "belief" is. You sound like a right wing christian national who believes in violence or "putting to the sword" of heretics.

        <p>Can you please give some context? What's the infection fatality rate for covid? What is the average age of death? What were the average number of comorbidities? What is the risk level for healthy people? How many lives do you think lockdown has prevented? Why is there no correlation in mortality outcome between states with harsh restrictions vs states with no or minimal restrictions? Why are countries like Sweden who had minimal restrictions showing no abnormal number of total excess deaths per capita when compared to previous years? </p>
<p>The ones really dying are nonagenarians and octogenarians with multiple comorbidities. These are the people with ages over the life expectancy. The 85 year-old that can die of covid would have also died of the flu or pneumonia. Even in people who are over 90, the mortality rate of covid does not exceed the mortality rate of just being that age. </p>
<p>Relatively young and healthy parents are not in risk at all from dying from covid. In fact, they have a bigger chance of dying from the flu. Children are actually 5 times more likely to die from the flu.</p>

        <p>Here are some facts and figures that you requested so you don't have to look them up on google yourself: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html </p>
<p>According to current studies better lockdown in the USA could have prevented 40% that's 200K+ deaths that COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. Most of the states that had little restriction have little population. FFS LA county ALONE only has 9 states that have greater population and that INCLUDES California, of which it is a part. There's no confusion as to why a pandemic spreads in higher population areas. FFS it's why it's called communicable and a pandemic. Why should children sacrifice their parents, or parents their children when something so simple as a mask can prevent the spread to a great degreee? Sweden reported ALL of their deaths, while many states have occluded the data to provide lower statistics and that is evidential (able to be proven). Sweden also had a death rate that was far higher than most are reporting:https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/89017 the case fatality rate was 6.8% instead of the 2.8% in the USA: https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/89017. They didn't have "abnormal" deaths because they reported the deaths and their causes. It wasn't "abnormal" because they said it was caused by something. Check out the way Sweden reported: https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/89017. Meanwhile, in the USA, we're not reporting every death with a distinct cause and compared to previous years, we're 500K+ above where we should be if things were "normal". Also, NO THEY DON'T HAVE A CHANCE OF DYING FROM THE FLU (more than Covid-19). The current established rates of infection and death (which are more likely to increase than decrease) is: According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the case fatality rate for the seasonal flu is approximately 0.1%. Thus far, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 in the US has been cited anywhere between 1% and 5%—a death rate 10 to 50 times higher. The idea that you're willing to sacrifice elders just to not wear a mask or take simple precautions is downright Sociopathic or Psychopathic depending on why you're deciding that their lives don't matter as long as you aren't effected.</p>

        <p>Your newest comment for some reason doesn't show up here (i think you are shadow banned) so I'm replying on this one. </p>
<p>You don't even know the difference between the CFR and the IFR. Learn about that first.</p>
<p>The elederly don't need this fake, condescending, patronizing "protection" aka medieval quackery that is doing absolutely nothing but cause harm, mental anguish, and destruction of every facet of society. Before March of 2020, it was generally understood that every year of a fraction of elderly people die from respiratory illnesses. That's just a fact. Go look up the CDC's stats from previous years on pneumonia deaths...a very common cause of death for the elderly. </p>
<p>The average age of a "covid death" is the age of life expectancy in the West. This is why the whole narrative of "older people need protection from covid, and this is all to protect them" is not accurate at all, and is in fact ignorant or disingenuous. People who are "vulnerable" to covid, are also vulnerable to other causes of natural death that no one ever claimed to want to protect them from. The idea that covid is anything remotely like a death sentence for everyone who is elderly is completely false. It is also a complete misunderstanding of the nature of this virus and the facts of how elderly people, who have reached the end of their natural lifespan die. </p>
<p>Covid doesn't "kill" people because it is especially harmful of a virus. Covid "kills" by being too much for someone with a very weak immune system to handle...just like any mild virus can and does do. This is why there are warnings about taking immuno suppressing drugs, for example. There are viruses and bacteria that exist in the bodies of every single human and ones we come into contact with every single day. They are completely harmless for the average immune system. But when someone has a severely suppressed immune system, such harmless pathogens can cause death. </p>
<p>The vast majority of elderly people will be completely okay (94% of those over 80 will not die if they contract covid). Many will not even have symptoms at all. Covid only skews a higher mortality rate for the elderly because many old people are far more likely to have severe late-stage health conditions and weakened immune systems as a result of the aging process. Also, there is the fact that people who aren't really old have been brainwashed to be irrationally afraid of this virus. Those in their 60s, for example, have no greater risk of death from covid than they do of annual flu. But the way society acts, is as if covid is a death sentence or a month long hospital stay on a ventilator for anyone over 60. This is absurd. A 65 year-old with a severe illness like cancer might die, as their immune system having to fight covid will simply be the last straw on their already frail body. But the average person in their 60s or 70s will not, most won't have anything more than mild or moderate symptoms. </p>
<p>"Changing things for an at-risk group" doesn't make any more sense than the rest of this insanity. Isolating people does not work, neither is trying to stop a highly contagious but mild respiratory virus. What measures would be used? Lockdown anyone over 65? Over 75? Over 80? That is absurd for many reasons, some of these reasons I mentioned above. It is also extremely unethical to isolate elderly people and restrict their lives in a fallacious attempt to "protect" them. This is why no one would have ever told their 80 year-old grandmother to not leave her house or have contact with anyone so she doesn't die of pneumonia. You know how absolutely ridiculous that notion would have been prior to 11 months ago? </p>
<p>The only places that should have had any sort of precautions are hospitals. This is just common sense that was known and understood in 2019 by both professionals and laymen alike. I really still wake up every day trying to understand why the world reacted the way he did to this virus and why every bit of logic, reason, science, and common sense was flushed down the toilet 11 months ago.</p>

        <p>I'm more than aware of the difference between and the (<em>possible</em> sometimes) correlation between IFR and CFR. Also, I don't care. The idea that you're willing to sacrifice the elderly or weak so that you aren't inconvenienced is offensive at best and pitiful at worst. Also, you're probably right, I'm probably banned or shadow-banned for speaking truth. Get off you high fucking horse, I guarantee you that if it was your parent or child (because both die pretty regularly due to complications from Covid19, I DON'T CARE IF IT WAS A COMORBIDITY, it wasn't necessary for those people to die if more people just had a respect for life outside of theirs and those they love.</p>

        <p>Like I said, kids die 5 more times more from the flu than covid.</p>
<p>No one is sacrificing lives. People aren't going outside and coughing on people. We are simply people who choose to live our lives and go out side (symptomless) and engage in activities we always did. We just don't wear masks, because they are ineffective (cases have been surging for months with mask mandates).</p>
<p>Good day.</p>

        <p>So what you're saying is that we shouldn't wear masks and protect children? We shouldn't take preventative measures so that parents don't have to face the deaths of their children. I'd think it's the other way around. Perhaps we need to increase our preventative measures if the common flu kills so many children. NOT that we SHOULDN'T protect our elders.</p>

        <p>Do you think I don't?!?! Are you fucking kidding me?!?! Of course we all want our faces uncovered. Of course we like socializing. Humans are social creatures after all. However, the idea that I would put in danger some one else's kids, parents, etc. is pure selfishness if something as simple as wearing a mask could even save ONE. Also, just so you know, I'd even keep wearing one around your family, even though you're so disrespectful of every other human.</p>

        <p>Well, you know that if the US government had actually addressed the issue rather than decrying it as a hoax and screaming that the whole issue was some political bullshit, we wouldn't be in this position. What else are you so concerned about? That they kept your children out of classrooms so that they weren't exposed at all, or at least minimally, vs having them in classrooms with children that have no understanding of personal protection? Especially when their parents are screaming that it's a hoax? Telling their children that they should be able to go play with all those other children without the understanding that they are taking their own, as well as other's lives in their hands when they refuse to take precautions?</p>

        <p>I'm concerned that we have forgotten what it means to be human through all of this. I'm concerned that we will raise a generation of neurotic, undereducated children. I'm concerned for the death of small business - especially urban center brick and mortars. I'm concerned for the complete annihilation of arts and culture. I'm concerned that social distancing will empty city centers and exponentially accelerate suburban sprawl. I'm concerned that work from home is going to crash the commercial real estate markets.  I'm concerned that people like you will insist that we wear these fucking masks forever. I'm concerned that these lockdowns has resulted in the greatest transfer of wealth to the 1% in the history of society. I'm concerned that hardliners such as yourself are obsessed with advancing a political ideology and not so much the health and safety of others. I'm concerned that everyone is so fucking short sighted and oblivious to the collateral damage this is causing. </p>
<p>But most of all - I'm concerned that the average age that people die from covid is just about the age at which people die and that this was all a massive collective psychosis that never should have happened. We fucked ourselves. The world will never be the same and not in a good way. So how bout you take your masks, lockdowns, and mandates and shove them right up your fucking ass.</p>

        <p>I'm a 1000% with you on the death of small business. Very few people realize that the US makes a great deal of it's money through small business and that each of those only make their money over an average of 3 months out of the year. I want my kids (not that I'm likely to have any survive at my age, not that I'm elderly, just that I won't put kids through a loss of 15 IQ (I understand it's a poor measurement, yet it's one of the only we have.) just because I hit 50. That's a few years away, but I'm sure as fuck not going to just find some lady that wants to have kids and knock her up just so I can have kids before 50. Seriously though, between the issue of children being born later, parents not raising their children well (entitlement, abusive, combative) should not be what we base our future upon. Greed, Avarice, Selfishness, these are the hallmarks of our current society. We need to grow the hell up and teach our children better. Yet we shove them off on the internet or the tv rather than spend time with them, educate them, raise them with a respect of others and nature. I'm not saying this doesn't occur. It just doesn't occur at the rate it should because the adults are so out of touch due to the way society impregnates selfishness into each of us. We have grown accustomed to our elders surviving into the great-grandkids level whilst even 300 years ago, a fleeting timeline; since we've been around a couple hundred thousand years at least. Our modern medical science has allowed us to extend our lives from 40 years to 80 in the last 3 centuries. So you can say fuck my masks, lockdowns, and mandates; tell me to shove them straight up my ass. Yet I'll still go out of my way and wear a mask lest I kill one of your kids, parents, or grandparents. Can't you do the same for the rest of the people, or are you just that self-centered, or selfish?</p>

        <p>You’re mistaking average lifespan for true lifespans which were relatively the same since antiquity. Socrates died at age 70, and not of old age, but because he was executed. People in ancient times could live to ripe old ages, it’s just that so many children died back then that it messes up the average so people believe that people generally only lived to about 40 which is not true.</p>

        <p>No idea where the original poster is that they have been in lockdown for the whole year.
My son is 11 months, so completely a Covid baby, and even in the UK he’s been in lockdown less than half his shorter life and has some relationships with kids and knows both sets of grandparents, not too often in person but several times a week on video chat.
You can totally keep your child socialised, just takes a bit of work.</p>

        <p>Buddy not only are you affecting yourself by not complying with these rules, but others. If you get infected and come into contact with an elderly man or someone who can’t fight off the virus you could potentially kill them.

        <p>This is a fallacy that you can’t prove. Everywhere you go you see people wearing masks to the point of 95%+ compliance. So this is something that’s latched onto as a means to try to blame something because people can’t wrap their head around that the virus is still transmitting regardless of masks.</p>

        <p>&rt; all you care about is your stupid fucking "freedom."</p>
<p>This post is about how much the childrtare losing because of these lockdowns, not freedom.</p>
<p>&rt; When you inevitably catch COVID and spread it to your already sick grandmother</p>
<p>I probably had it last year and I came out fine. Also, both my grandmothers were dead years before this whole thing happened. Does that let me off the hook?</p>
<p>&rt; I hope to god your family abandons you for causing her death, and you go on to live a sad, meaningless life full of pain and anguish</p>
<p>You seem to be suffering disproportionately from this lockdown too. I recommend you see a therapist for these negative thoughts you are consumed by.</p>
<p>&rt; I pray that I don't ever have to interact with you spineless, rat faced cretins, crawling around in your own filth and desperately pretending that you're achieving something. Fuck off and die.</p>
<p>So you're a praying person? You seem to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. Re-read what you wrote here and ask how Jesus would respond to such anger and vitriol.</p>
<p>Also, you say you don't want to interact with us, yet you came here on purpose. No one made you come here, so you anger is your own fault. Lastly, I will be reporting you and this post and then blocking you forever. Feel free to do the same.</p>
<p>Please feel better.</p>

        <p>The fact that you understand neither the novel portion of the nature of the virus, nor the concept of herd immunity and how it protects immunocompromised people just makes this sad.  Is your objective to make people pity you?  Because that's the reaction.  You're a harmful idiot, and we think you're pathetic.  Get your shit figured out.</p>

        <p>I understand the concept of herd immunity just fine. It requires a certain percentage of the population to get whatever is going around so they develop immunity to it and don't spread it anymore. This is why ONLY high risk people should have been isolated, for the amount of time required to achieve herd immunity. And I usually share the Great Barrington Declaration link when I mention what is essentially focused protection, so yeah, it's not even originally my idea but it's very logical. <br>
You're pulling a lot of stuff out of thin air (the nice way to say it). And you're sharing a personal opinion about a complete stranger, not very logical, not based on facts in the least. You can't speak for anyone else, buddy. <br>
Most peoples' immune systems work fine, and this is why they didn't have to live in bubbles. Anyone who does have a compromised immune system knows it, usually. Sometimes a person will develop that health issue at some point, but they just have to deal with it when it happens. Doesn't mean HEALTHY people should stop their lives and take actions (wearing a mask, social distancing, etc) to make them sick.</p>

        <p>Can you please give some context? How deadly is the virus? What's the infection fatality rate for  covid? What is the average age of death? What were the average number of comorbidities? What is the risk level for healthy people? How many lives do you think the virus has prevented? Why is there no correlation in mortality outcome between states with harsh restrictions vs states with no or minimal restrictions? Why are countries like Sweden who had minimal restrictions showing no abnormal number of total excess deaths per capita when compared to previous years?</p>
<p>Answer these questions, truthfully, then we can have a sensible, rational discussion about what is happening.</p>

<p>None of those were dealbreakers then. We accept those complications as potential risks for every single viral infection (including other coronaviruses). Now those same complications are suddenly unnacceptable for COVID19?</p>

<p>Covid causes permanent damage to the lungs and brain, and to more severe a degree than other common illnesses like the cold or flu (barring outliers) while spreading more rapidly due to the slow onset of symptoms (although mild cases still cause the permanent damage)</p>

        <p>I never claimed to be sitting on all the evidence and statistics buddy. If you're not sourcing Facebook memes (I'm using Facebook memes as a derogatory way to refer to absurd conspiracies that spread through misinformation and general ignorance in specific studies over social platforms thanks to the lack of critical thought training in school) then show me. </p>
<p>As I said, not only does Covid spread faster and wider thanks to incubation and slow onset of symptoms it causes permanent damage to ~~everyone~~ (generalization, a study of irish patients showed 62% were still suffeting after having medically recovered, while more conservative estimates from places like Harvard puts the percent closer to 50%, but the full extent and damage is unknown) who contracted it, unlike the flu or cold, where most who are affected have no long term damage.</p>
<p>Also, there are literally free flu shots available in just about every pharmacy, but the Covid vaccines are just beginning to be distributed, meaning that until a majority of the population is inoculated, people shouldn't be going to parties or on vacations.</p>

<p>"Everyone". What a load of bullshit. Either you're trolling or you are a victim of some serious propaganda. The vast majority of people who get infected with covid show mild or no symptoms at all (just like any other highly contagious respiratory virus), and they certainly don't all get permanent damage. </p>
<p>Sourced directly from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html">CDC</a>:</p>
<p>"While most persons with COVID-19 recover and return to normal health, <em>some patients</em> can have symptoms that can last for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness."</p>
<p>"Everyone", yeah right.</p>

        <p>I agree that was a Generalization and amended my comment (see above). The amount of people suffering "long haul" symptoms are put between 62% (small sample size) and a more conservative 50%, meaning that a majority likely will have symptoms that persist for long after their "recovery". Studies are still ongoing as this is literally just developing.</p>

        <p>Covid 19 is not the flu. Most people have flu symptoms for 2-4ish days, and don't need to be hospitalized and/or intubated as a result. People are not getting permanent organ damage from the flu. We don't stay home and avoid other people and have these (pseudo)lockdowns for the flu because it's not as severe and we have widely available vaccinations against it. (Death rate is not the only factor at play here.)</p>
<p>Just as an example, my husband is older. He would not lose his job or be incapable of providing for his family, be away from our children, or incur a massive hospital bill as a result of catching the flu. He could die from Covid, and we would be utterly fucked, financially and emotionally. So, the kids are going to online school. They only spend time with friends outdoors. We exercise outdoors or at home. We're not going to restaurants or interacting with people unnecessarily, at least until he and my MIL are vaccinated. We are choosing to mitigate the risk. </p>
<p>It's like purchasing insurance. Yes, you pay money every month even though you may not ever use it, but the alternative is possibly going bankrupt if you get into an accident or develop a serious health condition. Some day Covid will no longer be a risk, and shit will return to normal.</p>

<p>Yes, they are. You should do some basic research about influenza before making a false statements like this.</p>

<p>It already isn't a risk to the vast majority of the worlds population, yet peoples businesses were destroyed, children lost a year of education and social development, the economy was crashed (which contributed to more colleteral damage such as increases in suicidies, overdoses and starvation).</p>

Many always had their only meal at school which they suddenly weren't able to have anymore. There's a reason why grades all over the world are dropping and depression is on the rise more than ever.

        <p>I’ve had the flu almost annually all my life, as well as most people I know, and I don’t know anyone who’s had long-lasting complications from it. </p>
<p>The hospitals are full right now with Covid patients. They aren’t normally full of flu patients. </p>
<p>I fail to see how transmission/infection rates are relevant to this conversation. Herpes and HPV affect roughly the same percentage of the population, but herpes is basically harmless besides the occasional outbreak of sores, and HPV can give you cancer and kill you. They are not the same.</p>
<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Covid 19 is a brand new virus and EVERYONE is susceptible to it. Two healthy people of the same age can both get Covid, and one can need hospitalization while the other doesn’t even know they have it. There’s no way of telling who’s gonna be severely ill as result. My professor got it last semester, and she couldn’t even teach from home for nearly two weeks because of how ill she was, and she is 36. There are so many risk factors, even simple things like smoking or being overweight, which a massive percentage of the US population is. It is not <em>just</em> the elderly we are protecting from illness. </p>
<p>I do think the pandemic could have been handled much better by our government officials, and then the collateral damage from the health and safety measures that we have taken wouldn’t have been so severe.</p>

<p>That's simply an anecdote. Try researching the data, like I suggested.</p>
<p>&rt;The hospitals are full right now with Covid patients. They aren’t normally full of flu patients. </p>
<p>Actually hospitals overflow and reach capacity every single year during flu season. Just, because you don't hear much or anything about it, doesn't mean it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>&rt;I fail to see how transmission/infection rates are relevant to this conversation</p>
<p>Not just the infection rates. Infection <em>fatality</em> (death) rate. The IFR shows us how severe a disease is. The higher the IFR is, the more deadly a virus is. Covid has an extremely low IFR.</p>
<p>&rt;Covid 19 is a brand new virus and EVERYONE is susceptible to it.</p>
<p>This isn't a magical alien supervirus that no one knows anything about, as if this virus wasn't a respiratory virus, a mild coronavirus... hardly anything enigmatic. It's been over a year, we have more than enough data on the severity of the virus and who it really affects (primarily people who are at or over their life expectancy).</p>
<p>&rt;EVERYONE is susceptible to it</p>
<p>That's true. But that's why we use statistics, so we know the chances of someone getting sick/dying from different age groups. Kids for example are literally 5 times more likely to die from the flu than covid.</p>

“MY KID NEEDS TO SEE GRAMMA AND GRANDPA AND HAVE FRIENDS”</p>
<p>No, your kid needs to learn to not be a selfish brat and understand the world doesn’t revolve around their needs and wants. Then again, these parents are imparting this dangerous and egocentric mentality on their children so there’s no hope anyway.</p>

        <p>So, now even CHILDREN are 'selfish brats' for daring to want to be with family and interact with their friends? If you were their age you would feel the same way.</p>
<p>Children have a very small chance of catching the virus in the first place. And even now, more die of influenza and pneumonia every year.</p>
<p>Children (and the elderly) have committed SUICIDE due to the isolation and imprisonment. Children need to be children. </p>
<p>Yes, we all what little germ-spreaders children are, but so are plenty of adults.</p>
<p>You are either one of those toxic, aggressively childless psychos at r/childfree (there is nothing wrong with not wanting children, but hating on them and calling them 'crotch goblins' and 'fuck trophies' is revolting) or have not gone through your children bouncing off the walls out of frustration and stress at being locked away like little gaolbirds or being so young, as in this tweet they no nothing more than our current state of affairs.</p>

        <p>I love how you attack my physical looks. Hilariously pathetic.</p>
<p>I’m sorry that I value your life and your chance of survival over minor social inconveniences. I’m sorry that people have died because individuals act selfishly (not complying with mask mandates or local ordinances//socialize without proper protocol being followed) and now you feel as though we’re being ridiculous because we want the citizens of the world to actually unify and work towards overcoming something as a whole.</p>
<p>I’m childless currently, by choice, but that’s a discussion for my wife and I to enjoy at another point. If people don’t want to have children or unable to because of financial/biological/extraneous circumstances then that’s fine to. Get over it.</p>
<p>I live with four adults, all working in some capacity during this pandemic. We have pets and understand the stir craziness of staying inside and following rules. But we’re not going to sacrifice someone else’s safety for our own benefit.</p>
<p>That would be selfish. And my momma didn’t raise no selfish brat.</p>
<p>It’s not about your wants or your child’s wants. It’s about the worlds needs and right now we need to be working towards healing and helping and not exacerbating the situation because you’re grumpy that your kid is stuck inside with you. Maybe you should have thought about that?</p>
<p>Also, why bring up suicide unless that’s an issue you are always upset about. Suicide is a horrific, tragic, awful thing but it has happened before and was going to continue because of this situation. It’s a mental health issue, but that’s an entire different conversation, sunshine, and I’m not interested in having that particular one with you.</p>

        <p>I said you are PROBABLY ugly, mate, not that you actually were. Learnt how to read, alright?</p>
<p>Being locked away in their homes for months on end is just as damaging as this virus. You 'care about my life'? Doesnae sound like tae me, bitch.</p>
<p>I have lost almost everything I ever own because I happened to be in the middle of moving house when this lockdown and travel ban shite happened and is still bloody happening. Hell, I would be bloody homeless were it not for my boyfriend taking me in. And let us not even get started about the Far greater and longer lasting mental issues that have arisen from being locked away in general...</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with wearing masks or social distancing and especially not the handwashing, but when they are MANDATED and therefore forced on everyone, they are an issue. Lockdowns? Social distancing, especially for someone who is registered blind (hi)? Aye, such 'minor' incomviences. People have been unable to feed their families (because their jobs, especially if a small business, were deemed 'non-essential' - everyone's job is essential to THEM, everyone's job is essential to keeping the world and the economy going) or outright homeless due to lockdown. And again, we have the SUICIDES:</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/92nk0m5RVWU</p>
<p>And yes, the people who wear hijabs...I mean masks, like good like slaves and receive shouribg, scrwaming and insults in their faces are the selfish ones. Especially those who cannot wear one:</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/GJdOkzYcAVU</p>
<p>I wear one as I have no other choice, even though I have severe asthma (which is SO FUN when my breathing is made harder) or my anxiety and my intense feelings of being trapped. </p>
<p>That does mean those rude teats who scream about having to wear a mask are any better, as I am merely pointing out the double standard. And it is not yout job to keep me 'safe' or vice versa.</p>
<p>People have died of cancer and heart disease to because their treatment was deemed less important or even 'non-essential' . </p>
<p>Once again, you show your lack of reading comprehension. I never said it was bad to be childless. I said that you have no fucking idea what the children are going through. And as much as I love pets and have had plenty, it is not and never will be the same thing when it comes to raising them. Love and treatment? Yes, in my opinion.</p>
<p>No, it is not. Your kind are the selfish, heartless twats who see nothing wrong with children's lives, social development, and mental state being destroy so others can feel 'safe'. Your kind are the selfish twats when you don't care about parents and carers, especially those of pjyiscally and/or mentally disably children being run ragged due to be locked away.</p>
<p>The 'world's needs', fuck off. Most of 'the world' wants to be free of this shite, and no-one is required to care about the rest of the world anyway. 'A little grumpy'? Try actually talking to some parents, lad. I have seen and heard this shite both in person and around the world.</p>
<p>People NEED to be outside in the fresh air. People NEED to be able to interact with, touch and be with their loved ones and friends. People NEED to be to travel to perform important tasks or again, to be with their loved ones.</p>
<p>Who the duck is the goverment to tell you to lock yourself away or how far you can be from your house? Sounds a wee bit fascist to me... </p>
<p>Nice job avoid facing the facts, you even more selfish, heartless, repulsive wretch. And you are damn right I care. And most people, again, cannot even go to a place to help with their mental health.</p>

        <p>Apologies, but the correct quote was “give it a search and you’ll see what I’m talking about.”</p>
<p>Another way of saying “go do your own research.” You won’t back it up yourself, but you want others to do the legwork for you. It’s lazy, dismissive, and doesn’t help in a conversation.</p>
<p>And that’s all the time I’ve got for ya. Have a good one!</p>

<p>All different years. Someone even posted a collage of headlines dating back 8 years and every single one had flu cases overrunning hospitals.</p>
<p>At the bottom of this page, you'll find a download link for an excel spreadsheet that gives the number of pneumonia / influenza deaths at each medical or nursing home facility in the UK from 2015 to 2017. It's quite a lot. Breaks it down by sex and age. This is way before covid so again, you cannot blame all this on covid or pretend it never happened before covid.</p>

<p>US flu cumulative hospitalizations in 2017-2018 flu season: 710,000</p>
<p>That was just one flu season- BEFORE everything was called Covid-19.</p>
<p>Now, with every hospital visit being called a covid visit:</p>
<p><a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_coronavirus_hospitalizations">https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_coronavirus_hospitalizations</a></p>
<p>It's at 853,414. And we all know that's over-inflated, includes every common cold and influenza, and is spread WELL OVER 1 flu season.</p>
<p>Influenza in Bolivia is the number one killer every single year.</p>
<p>Stop telling me to be afraid of something that's WAY less deadly than the flu. Covid isn't shit.</p>

<p>All different years. Someone even posted a collage of headlines dating back 8 years and every single one had flu cases overrunning hospitals.</p>
<p>At the bottom of this page, you'll find a download link for an excel spreadsheet that gives the number of pneumonia / influenza deaths at each medical or nursing home facility in the UK from 2015 to 2017. It's quite a lot. Breaks it down by sex and age. This is way before covid so again, you cannot blame all this on covid or pretend it never happened before covid.</p>

<p>and</p>
<p>In 2018 alone, pneumonia killed 800,000 children, and while deaths from other infectious diseases, including malaria, diarrhoea are falling, fatal pneumonia cases are declining at a much slower pace. </p>

<p>Not everyone lives in the United States.</p>
<p>And the CDC is under a lawsuit for violating federal law and inflating Covid deaths by up to 1,600% based on this study:</p>

<p>It's been called out several times last year for inflating numbers. This is nothing new.</p>
<p>Sorry, but calling every single death a covid death is pretty fucking lame. I don't submit to fear porn.</p>

        <p>You do realize that there is no single "flu" virus, right? You do understand that there is a reason that seasonal influenza is differentiated by outbreak and strain? </p>
<p>I don't understand -- you're upset that H1N1/H3N2 is specified by seasonal outbreak, but not when the same thing is done for SARS-COV-2? This seems like a double standard. What, in your opinion, is the real mortality rate of COVID-19?</p>

        <p>I'm not upset. I'm only wondering why you are pretending that influenza with all it's strains is perfectly ignorable even when it causes pneumonia, but we have to completely shut down and wear useless masks when Covid hits. </p>
<p>And no, we have not seen anything like we did last March and April. That happened only once. That was Covid. Now we are back to influenza. </p>
<p>And it's interesting that you bring up SARS. No one shut down or ended their lives over that one, did they?</p>

        <p>I'm not sure that you understand what it is you are talking about. SARS-COV-2 is the virus. COVID-19 is the disease. HIV-1 is the virus. AIDS is the disease. If you don't understand the terminology, don't join the conversation.</p>
<p>Re: masks:</p>
<p>&rt;  Both surgical masks and unvented KN95 respirators, even without fit-testing, reduce the outward particle emission rates by 90% and 74% on average during speaking and coughing, respectively, compared to wearing no mask, corroborating their effectiveness at reducing outward emission. These masks similarly decreased the outward particle emission of a coughing superemitter, who for unclear reasons emitted up to two orders of magnitude more expiratory particles via coughing than average. </p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7</p>
<p>&rt; A cotton mask led to an approximately 20% to 40% reduction in virus uptake compared to no mask. The N95 mask had the highest protective efficacy (approximately 80% to 90% reduction) of the various masks examined; however, infectious virus penetration was measurable even when the N95 mask was completely fitted to the face with adhesive tape. In contrast, when a mask was attached to the mannequin that released virus, cotton and surgical masks blocked more than 50% of the virus transmission, whereas the N95 mask showed considerable protective efficacy. There was a synergistic effect when both the virus receiver and virus spreader wore masks (cotton masks or surgical masks) to prevent the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33087517/</p>
<p>&rt; Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (odds ratio [OR], 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24–0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non–healthcare workers (non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.11–0.37) and 47% (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36–0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR, 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR, 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR, 0.55), SARS (OR, 0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR, 0.04).</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1477893920302301</p>
<p>&rt; This study evaluated the FFE of 7 consumer-grade masks and five procedure mask modifications. The mean (SD) FFE of consumer-grade face masks tested in this study ranged from 79.0% (4.3%) to 26.5% (10.5%), with the washed, 2-layer nylon mask having the highest FFE and the 3-layer cotton mask having the lowest. The cotton bandana folded into a multilayer rectangle affixed to the ears with rubber bands, as described by the US Surgeon General, provided a mean (SD) FFE of 49.9% (5.8%). Folding the bandana bandit style produced a similar result (mean [SD] FFE, 49.0% [6.2%]). The tested mean (SD) FFE of the single-layer polyester gaiter/neck cover balaclava bandana was 37.8% (5.2%). The single-layer polyester/nylon mask, which is attached with tie strings, tested at a mean (SD) FFE of 39.3% (7.2%). The polypropylene mask with nonelastic (fixed) ear loops tested at a mean (SD) FFE of 28.6% (13.9%).</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33300948/</p>
<p>&rt; When the receiver head wore a mask, it significantly reduced the amount of total particles found by 21.8%; when the receiver head wore a face shield, the reduction was significantly higher: 54.8% (p = 0.003). When the emitter head wore a mask or a face shield, it significantly reduced the amount of total particles found by a greater level of 96.7%. When the receiver and the emitter wore a mask, it significantly reduced the amount of total particles found by a greater level of 97.3%; when they two wore a face shield, the reduction was significantly higher: 98.0% (p = 0.022)</p>

        <p>Using studies of sick patients as proof that healthy people need to wear masks?  That's what you're doing?  Seriously?  Can you at least TRY to pretend you know what the fuck you're talking about, you fucking sheep?</p>
<p>So you're not going to address the fact that you've spent your entire life ignoring influenza (and no, I don't give a shit about naming every strain)?  You and everyone else ignored the shit out of that, but since the media told you to be afraid of covid, suddenly you're all hypochondriacs!</p>

        <p>The problem with COVID-19 is that carriers can be asymptomatic for weeks on end. How do you differentiate the "healthy" from the "unhealthy?" Second, why do you assume that I've spent my "entire life ignoring influenza?" My home country used respirators as a preventative measure to combat season influenza and other aerosolized contagions, and surprise, it worked. So why can't you put a mask on again?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>&rt; The Ct value dynamics of the RdRp gene from URT specimens showed that viral loads of symptomatic (including presymptomatic) patients tended to decrease more slowly in the time interaction trend than those of asymptomatic patients (β = 0.040 [SE, 0.020]; P = .048) (Figure 2). As shown in Figure 3, the Ct value dynamics of env genes from LRT specimens showed that viral loads of asymptomatic patients tended to decreasemore slowly in the time interaction trend than those of symptomatic (including presymptomatic) patients (β = −0.065 [SE, 0.023]; P = .005). <strong>There were no significant differences in Ct values of env (β = −0.012 [SE, 0.035]; P = .73) and N genes (β = 0.011 [SE, 0.016]; P = .49), from URT specimens and RdRp (β = −0.015 [SE, 0.026]; P = .57) and N genes (β = −0.006 [SE, 0.018]; P = .75), from LRT specimens between asymptomatic and symptomatic (including presymptomatic) patients.</strong> [...] Many individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection remained asymptomatic for a prolonged period, and viral load was similar to that in symptomatic patients.</p>
<p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2769235</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>NP+OP sample viral loads of asymptomatic patients were found to be significantly higher (p = 0.0141) when compared with symptomatic patients</strong>. However, a similar difference was not observed when other samples (i.e., oral cavity, saliva) were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p = 0.2483, p = 0.8155). Comparisons of NP+OP and saliva samples’ viral loads between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are shown in Figs. 1 and ​and 2, respectively. PCR positivity and viral loads of several different sample types were compared across male and female patients <strong>and no significant differences were found.</strong></p>
<p>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s15010-020-01548-8</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>The viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients</strong>, which suggests the
transmission potential of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. These findings are in concordance with reports that transmission may occur early in the course of infection^5 and suggest that case detection and isolation may require strategies different from those required for the control of SARS-CoV.</p>

        <p>PCR tests are not proof.  It's been ruled in court, reported in newspapers, and testified by doctors to be completely unreliable.  Even the creator of the test said it was never designed to be a diagnostic tool and it is completely useless in that regard.</p>
<p>Look at this from that second study:</p>
<p>"No PCR positivity were found in blood. Only one asymptomatic patient had positive PCR result for urine sample."</p>
<p>It failed to find anything in blood and only one had a positive sample in urine yet the study concludes that asymptomatic people have a much higher viral load?

        <p>Do some research dude. The ones really dying are nonagenarians and octogenarians with multiple comorbidities. Those are the people over the life expextancy. 
The 85 year-old that can die of covid would have also died of the flu or pneumonia. Even in people who are over 90, the mortality rate of covid does not exceed the mortality rate of just being that age. </p>
<p>Relatively young and healthy parents are not in risk at all from dying from covid.</p>

        <p>I just checked the survivability rate for people between 40 and 50, because that's probably the age where you raise children. I could go with 30 to 40 but yeah</p>
<p>For people with no underlying conditions it's 99.998 survivability for women and 99.9965 for males.</p>
