    <strong>July 15, 2030.</strong>
    <p><p>I am halfway through the year 2030. I awake from my horrific nightmare with sweat pouring down my face. I shudder in fear as I recall my dream and write it down in my journal.</p>
<p><em>Dear Diary, I had accidentally taken in a breath of unfiltered air as my 5 masks were nowhere in sight. When I woke up, I was in my bed, but I accidentally left my window open last night. I shudder if I have been infected with Covid-29, perhaps I need to take a test.</em></p>
<p>I feel barely human anymore, but hey, that could just be a symptom of Covid-29. Freedom? What's that? Shit, its just fictional after all, for the greater good, some things must come to an end, I think to myself.  I pinch myself for daring to feel so entitled to such a prospect, at the expense of the greater good.</p>
<p>The morning buzzer sounds as I stare out the window to the breathtaking sight of New Fauci City (formerly known as New York City). Dr. Fauci died long ago, but his memory shall live on, I thought to myself. Saved us from the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, but unfortunately it kept mutating to the point of no return. I look at my schedules and remember that my 5th booster shot is due tomorrow, or was it the 5th? Perhaps its the 6th now?</p>
<p><em>Shivers</em></p>
<p>How much booster shots have I taken at this point? Hell if I know. Either way, to calm down, I dangle the flag in my hand as I pledge allegiance to the United Nations, and to our saviors, Dr. Bill Gates and Dr. Anthony Fauci.</p>
<p>I load up my computer and watch in disgust as our enemies continue to resist. Our enemies are Texas and Florida, to which the disgusting subhumans who reside there refused to submit to the New World Order to keep people safe. </p>
<p>"Keep people safe", my mantra that keeps my miserable self going, keeps me from withering in agony.</p>
<p>At long last, the RND-1984 drone has arrived to test me for Covid-29, to which the results come back negative. Feeling delightful, I wear my 5 masks and head out to get my booster shot. Delightful that I'm doing my part.</p></p>

        <p>I'm currently in school in the year of 2035. We are learning about face masks and how evolution impacted humanity. Did you know face masks go back thousands of years to the caveman days and we always wore them when we were introduced to new smells? So fascinating to be informed and aware in such a crisis. This pandemic apparently started in the year 2020 and was only supposed to be temporary. I wonder why it didn't go away but the chip in my head pulsates and my mind modifies its thoughts to remind me I'm government property, not "hugh man" or whatever that funky word is. I go home and boy am I starving, steak sounds good. I pop a "steak capsule" into my mouth and now I am full. I guess at one point we had to eat actual food but that sounds disgusting. We shouldn't have to eat at all. I need to go grocery shopping. I head to the store and wait in line. Only 10 people allowed in the Amazon store at a time and I hope I remembered to renew my "chip credits" and my "digital ID" The man at the door tells me I had an unfiltered thought today and my chip would be shut off for the month. I apologize and go home. I knew thinking would be a bad idea. I decide I need to talk to someone so I try to log in to "Internet-Act" or Inter-Act for short and nobody is comfortable enough to speak due to my mistake that I made today. I should've known better.</p>
<p>I remind myself the motto of the United Communist American Party. Don't question authority.</p>
