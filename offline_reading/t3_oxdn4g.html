    <strong>We are going to lose. The time has come to start thinking of alternatives.</strong>
    <p><p>The United States was founded by people who left everything they had ever known to build a new life.</p>
<p>Day by day, more areas are becoming only open for the vaccinated. We all know more variants, lockdowns, restrictions are on the way. The darkest days are still ahead. </p>
<p>If we try to fight to reclaim our homelands we will lose. We’ve been losing for a year and a half. </p>
<p>The only option at this point is for us to centralize and build a new society. Moving to Florida and then pushing for secession is one of many options. </p>
<p>We are a minority in most areas and countries. We have to accept a large portion of the population wants us dead. I don’t see any other options. It’s time to build anew.</p></p>

        <p>Thats like saying, lets abandon a multi million dollar mansion and build a new one from scratch because there are parasites and termites infecting the house. Fumigate the house and kill all the parasites destroying it. </p>
<p>Think of all the industry and institutions that were built over hundreds of years. You cant just replace those without erasing hundreds of years of progress. </p>
<p>I get what your saying but arent you tired of running? You think if you just leave theyll leave you alone? Eventually there will be no place left to go. Evil needs to be confronted and decisively destroyed. </p>
<p>Take back the institutions that parasitic forces have invaded. Let me remind you that at one time tyrants and communists did not inhabit high positions in office. They got there by playing the game while good people sat on their hands and did nothing. </p>
<p>It starts with you taking a stand and keeping evil out of whatever station you inhabit. If everyone in the country did just that, we wouldnt be in the position we are in. You only get one country and that is your home. Wherever you choose to go or whatever you do, it will always be your home. Fight for it, because it is too valuable just to give up on.</p>

        <p>You cant be any kind of influence for change if you dont order the world around you to your values. No matter how small it is. </p>
<p>You wanna know how it got this way? Because many people did just that over a long period of time. They ordered the immediate world around them with garbage and parasitic ideologies. It started with factory workers, teachers, and ordinary people. Over decades of time they continued this until it grew, became self replicating and breached every corner of society. </p>
<p>Everyone wants a quick fix and a grand masterplan that will save the world tomorrow. It will take time and consistency to turn things around, the same time and consistency enemies used to get us to this point. Thats the hard truth. </p>
<p>Yeah, I get very few people are billionaires and can massively influence the world in an instant. I'm not delusional. I'm merely proposing that if all of us do what we can where we are, the world will look different. </p>
<p>For instance I belong to a small group of contractors and tradesmen who have vowed not to mandate vaccines or masks for their workers. It seems small, but guess what, all their employees will be able to retain their livelihoods without worrying if tomorrow theyll be asked to get a jab. And people who got pushed out of their jobs because of vax mandates can work there instead. </p>
<p>Thats a win in my book and worthy of putting up a fight for. Do what you can where you are. Thats all Im saying.</p>

        <p>NY and LA can madate vaccination passes, the rest of the country doesn't care. We have been living and working in East Tennessee since we reopened in April 2020, and everyone here thinks the two week shutdown was an awful blunder. I've heard all the threats from terrorist propaganda, I still don't know of anyone who died from the China virus, our hospital was never crowded, we don't have plague corpses in the streets, et cetera... 🎃</p>

        <p>We have everything from industry to agriculture. If every company requires Vax they will be without employees and they will have to relocate to another state. This area has seen an influx of northerners and westerners, but they usually won't work factory or warehouse jobs. East Tennessee attracts a lot of doomsday preppers and survivalists, because we are a rural mountain region, without major airports and friendly law enforcement. </p>
