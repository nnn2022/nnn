    <strong>I just need to rant.</strong>
    <p><p>My dad is kind of weird when it comes to this situation. One day, he thinks one way, the next, he's completely different.  He doesn't think anything should be mandatory and thinks the face diapers are pretty stupid, but he wears them every day since he's "a law abiding citizen." But every now and then he even supports them. He pretty much disagrees with crap like the antisocial distancing being mandatory, but he thinks people should do it. Still, though, it completely depends on the day, but I'd say that's his bottom line usually. </p>
<p>But, he is all for the vaccine. Now let me just say, I would never call myself a conspiracy theorist and I don't think just having the opinion that everyone is overreacting and being gullible makes you one in the slightest. I'm also not anti-vaccine, but I am anti- this vaccine and anti-mandatory vaccine. He's kind of for making it mandatory, since "schools do it for other vaccines" although not just to go out in public like to the store or whatever. </p>
<p>He says he'd rather risk getting hurt through the vaccine than getting the virus because he's "bound to die" if he gets it. He's 70 and has "underlying conditions" but even then, the vast majority survive. I told him this and he's just like, yeah, but I'm not taking any chances on covid. He doesn't think the vaccine could kill him at all and whenever I tell him people die of the vaccine, he just says that they died of something else and everything that says someone died from it is not real evidence, blah blah blah. </p>
<p>Now, I know the vaccine isn't a death sentence and there haven't been a ton of deaths from it. But everyone I talk to that's had the shot says it made them super sick. Everyone says "Yeah, but you always have something happen when you get a vaccine, like your arm hurts a few days." But it doesn't make everyone that gets it sick! To me, this covid honestly sounds like a bad cold in most cases. Maybe if I get it, I'm one of the few that get it bad. Oh well. That could happen with any cold. I got a virus a few months ago, didn't want to get tested, so I don't know what it was, but it really sucked and I felt horrible. But I lived. Yeah, it really made me want to die at times when I was puking my guts out, but getting sick like that is a part of life. I got over it. To me, something like that just isn't worth a vaccine. </p>
<p>Another reason I don't want it and wish my dad wouldn't get it is just because they are pushing it so much and you're seen as a hero, and I resolved from day one that I wasn't going to go out of my way to do anything extra because of this virus, even if they try to force it on me. I just treated it like flu season and didn't change the way I live my life. I ignore all antisocial distancing and never wore a ridiculous muzzle and will never. These "measures" are just insanity and medically paranoid. Sane people don't act like this over a virus. That's called hypochondria. </p>
<p>Listen, I get other shots and I'm not anti-vaccines in general or a conspiracy theorist in the slightest. I just think there are other ways to treat it. Also, this virus didn't even exist a few years ago, and now I'm supposed to get immunized for it? I just don't want this one and I hate the fact that my dad is so happy about getting it. He's supposed to get it tomorrow.</p></p>

        <p>good rant, would read again</p>
<p>i'm picking up some despair in it</p>
<p>in the end, it's his call</p>
<p>like any other decision, he will receive the fruits of it, be they good or bad</p>
<p>you can't say you didn't urge him to caution, right?</p>

        <p>I think this is a case of live-and-let-live.  If your dad gets peace of mind by getting it, so be it.  It’s like you feeling better without the shot!  I know that it’s hard when someone close to you doesn’t see reason and to feel alienated as a result, that’s why we joined this sub, for the feeling of community. </p>
<p>And you shouldn’t feel like a conspiracy theorist for questioning the motives of the government in regards to this virus.  You’re not talking about 9/11 being planned, you’re talking about something that affects our everyday lives.  Anyone who calls you a conspiracy theorist is trying to gaslight you by throwing a label on you to invalidate your claims.  If that’s what a conspiracy theorist is, then that label should’ve been applied to everyone who opposed American involvement in the Vietnam war. </p>
<p>Either way, I hope that this provides some comfort for you.  And if it doesn’t and/or you disagree, that’s completely fine too! You’re allowed to be angry and frustrated!</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's not like I'm talking about the Earth being flat or anything. I know I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I just am tired of having to explain it.</p>
