    <strong>Why Covid spread is overblown: My own experience.</strong>
    <p><p>Before 3 weeks ago, I had not known of a single (proven) Covid case in my "Circle". Meaning nobody I knew got it officially.</p>
<p>Then I got a text from my brother (this is 3 weeks ago), who happens to be part time fabrication help in my shop. He told me he wasn't going to drop by, he was exposed to somebody who "tested" positive, and he was starting to feel symptoms. I already had been exposed to him by then, so if I was going to get it, it was what it was. Being that grandparents, and other shop help that are in their elderly ages are around my place frequently, precautions were necessary, we ended up cancelling Thanksgiving, and other help decided to take some time off. This is what you do in the situation.</p>
<p>So going forward. My brother couldn't work his normal day job for a term, because the close risk was too much, so I told him he could work with me (I needed the help anyway), I wasn't afraid, but he had to respect distances... He ended up testing positive with full blown symptoms... I worked a full 40 hours, in close contact, in a small shop, with a legit Covid case, and I didn't get it, nor did I pass it to any of my "vulnerable" close contacts... </p>
<p>During the duration, knowing after the positive, it was  too easy to start psych'ing yourself into having it, but then you realize, that after the 3rd or 4th day, and you feel better than you did the previous week, it's entirely garbage.</p>
<p>Not only is Covid not easy to spread if you're smart, it's not even dangerous to those you know.</p></p>

        <p>I had a similar experience: a family friend who comes by very often tested positive and we have been around him a lot with no mask and no distance and he showed symptoms but did not get it (the health system forced us to get tested two times and we were all negative)</p>

        <p>My dead parents would care to disagree with you about "It's not dangerous to those you know!" thank you very much.</p>
<p>Your experience is not the mean with this virus. There are a lot of people who have gotten CoVid-19 simply by being in the same room with an infected person for a few minutes. Not hours... just 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>There are also instances like yours where you are in close proximity to someone with it and do not get it but those are not the mean.</p>

        <p>Dude I’m very sorry about your parents. Shit sucks. It’s hard to figure out who to point a finger at and blame in this situation. The rehab center for sending your symptomatic dad home? Your parents themselves for not recognizing the situation and taking the proper precautions? Yourself for not stepping in when needed to make a better decision for parents who couldn’t do it for themselves?</p>
<p>Or is the reality actually that disease happens and the weakest in society are vulnerable to it and there’s not much we can do other than apply common sense in individual scenarios? </p>
<p>I agree, OP’s situation is one such situation out of many and might not be the average, but so is YOURS.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The sloppy thing now is to blame everyone else for elderly parents dying from or with covid.  What if it was actually flu??? Will we now be calling flu spread attempted murder?</p>

        <p>Jesus Christ. This kid and his dead parents are frigging all over these subs!  He must post 50 times a day about his dead parents. I’m sure that’s what they would have wanted.</p>
