        <p>Is this the goal. Where he said if we took the vaccine and continued wearing masks. That he might let us eat a hotdog with a couple of people. </p>
<p>Well demented Uncle Joe can go pound sand. I'll do whatever I want.</p>

        <p>&rt;Mindy Gee, 43, spoke of her surprise at how few people were getting shots in Utah.
&rt;
&rt;“In certain circles, it’s almost shameful to have gotten the vaccine,” she told the paper. “It’s completely bonkers to me.”</p>
<p>Well, let me be the first to say: thanks for the input, Mindy. I'll be sure to tell everyone that Mindy doesn't approve if you don't want to trade a 0.01% chance of dying for injecting experimental, gloablist biocum into your arm.</p>

        <p>I hate to break it to everyone but...none of the “numbers” associated with this scam are real. Not the infections, not the deaths, and certainly not the vaccinated.</p>
<p>Why would they lie about literally everything but decide to tell the truth about the number of vaccinated people?</p>

        <p>Prediction, the numbers will be fudged so that they come out just at the goal.  Followed by the big victory speech about July 4th being Covid Independence Day.</p>

        <p>&rt;Last week, only 2.4 million adults got their first shot — just over half the 4.2 million adults needed to get one each week to reach Biden’s long-touted July 4 goal.</p>
<p>&rt;The slowdown was blamed on the unvaccinated not wanting the shot rather than a lack of demand, with health care workers and volunteers often outnumbering those arriving to get jabbed, the paper said.</p>
<p>&rt;Health officials have already reached the “low-hanging fruit — those people who absolutely want to get vaccinated without you telling them anything,” White House infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told the paper.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>&rt;    Polls suggest about one-third of Americans have no immediate plans to get vaccinated, with many saying their skepticism has intensified over time, the paper noted.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>&rt;    The slowdown is national — with every state down at least two-thirds from its peak — but it is particularly stark across the South and Midwest, the outlet’s detailed analysis showed.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>&rt;    In 12 states, just 15 out of 10,000 people are getting vaccinated, with the rate just 4 out of 10,000 in Alabama, the data shows.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>&rt;    “We now know that we’re not going to be able to give out 1,000 vaccines in one day in these pockets. If we get 10, we’re ecstatic. If we get 15, it’s a good day,” he said</p>
<p>&rt;[Psychopath] Mindy Gee, 43, spoke of her surprise at how few people were getting shots in Utah.</p>
<p>&rt;“In certain circles, it’s almost shameful to have gotten the [experimental injection],” she told the paper. “It’s completely bonkers to me.”</p>

        <p>Here we have more of that bullshit spouting for mind control purposes... anyonne with an iota of sense left can see the obvious correlation between people that haven't yet got it, being the ones that arent vaccinated, not wanting it, simply meaning that there is in fact lack of demand. And they left out the clown music for the announcement of this inversion... what a bunch of tardos. They really do assume those that had better sense to only be marginally more intelligent than those that didn't. Oh, the hilarity.</p>
