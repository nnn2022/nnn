        <p>What bothers me is when I point out flaws in the logic of restrictions and people contort themselves with all sorts of mental gymnastics to come up with justifications for them after I shoot down their primary argument yet give zero mental flexibility to questioning the restrictions. Forcing healthy people to quarantine should be iron clad defensible if it's going to be advocated for. Not the other way around.</p>

        <p>Actually most times? Science is equal to fact.</p>
<p>This is not science being pushed. The science is the Danish mask study that said masks do nothing to prevent CoVid-19.</p>
<p>This is a political agenda connected with the 'Great Reset'.</p>
<p>Which to be totally honest: I support some of the Great Reset... I do not however think any country or any person should have it forced on them with lies.</p>

        <p>I agree with you 100%.  I shouldn't have to defend and provide evidence for living my life normally.  It should be up to the Lockdown loons to give a solid, evidence based reason for why they want to restrict people's liberty and destroy the economy.  So far I haven't seen that from anyone or any official.  NPIs clearly don't, yet here we are again with rolling lockdowns, and kids still not in school.</p>

        <p>I hated Trump at the beginning of this year. Then I actually read a list of what he's accomplished in office. And I actually started listening to him speak. And I changed my mind. My concept of him changed when I stopped listening to the left.</p>
<p>Someone recently called me a Trumper in an attempt to insult me. I told him I'm proud to be a Trumper because I've stopped listening to the blatant lies of the left.</p>
<p>Not saying you would change your mind, but this scamdemic and the mental gymnastics and fearmongering led me to actually look directly at the bad orange man and I was able to see through so many lies I had believed before. </p>

        <p>False right and false left. I made a post on why Trump is a false savior. Just because the left is awful doesn’t mean Trump is a saint. He’s not on our side. He declared a national emergency and he hasn’t lifted it. He called Covid the plague playing into the fearmongering. Everything he does is faux opposition. He bailed out the big corporations, signed it off while small businesses were slaughtered. He called certain states “opening early” dangerous. The whole government and both parties are complicit, the right is just a trap to catch those who would otherwise oppose the system which controls them. It’s a good cop bad cop thing, but at the end of the day they’re actors working for the same masters.</p>

        <p>I don't particularly like Trump's personality and I certainly don't agree with everything he says and he's no savior, but in terms of policies he's been pretty good, not perfect by any means but much better than anything we've had for decades. I don't think he's faux opposition or playing the good cop bad cop routine, if that were true why does the left hate him so much? Don't tell me it's all fake hate because it's not, they have been beating themselves into a foam at the mouth frenzy for the past 4 years.
I think some things he said about covid, particularly in the beginning, was at the influence of cockroaches like fauci and others of that ilk and to try to not be seen as uncaring or some other stupid reason like that, but he's s mostly been on the side of going back to normal and that we shouldn't let this thing completely disrupt our lives.</p>

        <p>The little people actually hate Trump. But those in government are perfectly fine with him, it’s simply that Biden has better PR (despite being a creepy old man with memory issues, he presents the fake Obama era approach to global relations). If the government didn’t like Trump he wouldn’t have made it so far. They would’ve probably killed him “due to Covid” or something. So the bloggers and article writers on the left hand Trump, and ordinary people on the left hate Trump, but the government and wealthy elite don’t despise him. </p>
<p>Why hasn’t Trump locked up Hillary, or arrested  any government criminals? He’s had 4 years to clean up corruption before the selection. The fraud happened because he let it happen, he’s an actor playing a part getting people angry and focused on the selection. The reason why he talks about going back to normal (barely, without any strong support of it, no policies just empty talk) is due to Trump Derangement Syndrome. Since whatever Trump says must be wrong, him simply saying that is a way of discrediting it to many people in the US and around the world.</p>

        <p>Mass disobedience. Don’t follow government mandates, have your businesses remain open, don’t wear a mask, refuse the vaccine, speak in opposition to the mainstream media narratives. Unfortunately we seem to have mass obedience right now instead of the opposite, but if we can turn around enough people there should be a snowball effect due to the prevalence of bandwagon riders who hop on new trends.</p>

        <p>&rt;I now recognize our freedoms are under attack</p>
<p>You think there are still freedoms?</p>
<p>This may sound cynic at first, but being bossed around, exploited and abused by politician scum who think they have the right to rule over you and who will send armed thugs after you to put you in a cage if you dare to resist any of their threats of violence ( which includes getting robbed by them) is not exactly freedom.</p>
<p>And it was the same in 2019 and before, though a bit less noticeable. But being caged because you happen to like some green crumbles in your cigarette is already peak-fascism, althought even that amount of tyranny got massively increased through the pretense of this scamdemic.</p>

        <p>I am also trying to live as I always have: no masks, no extra cleaning, no avoiding people, no washing my hands any more than I ever have. BUT, the world has changed drastically over the last 9 months and we will never return to a normal life unless and until millions of us march in the streets and refuse to comply with all these crazy restrictions. Open everything immediately, everything!

        <p>This is not what most democrats want....or wanted... but the last four years has changed things.  I’ve also mostly been aligned with the left but seeing almost all of my friends lose their minds about Trump served as some kind of wake up call.  The “vote him out at all costs” mentality has led to an escalation of politicization and groupthink on all matters, especially COVID.  I guarantee there are more liberals who are dying for a more nuanced and less vitriolic conversation about the virus but they’re terrified to speak up, lest be shamed by the basement dwelling rage monsters.</p>

        <p>That's a whole lot of pretty words, but I don't see a lot of reasonable action from leftists. Just hypocrisy. Four years of hate towards Trump, and now some leftist wants to come along pointing the finger at OTHER leftists? If that's how you feel, so be it, but I'm not running around playing your fucking head games. Keep avoiding accountability. I'm not chit chatting.</p>

        <p>Actually, I'm pretty sure it was planned by the Gates Foundation and GAVI Alliance in order to create a wordldwide surveillance state that lasts far longer than Trump did. As the totalitarian shit China did was adopted worldwide after the WHO reported how great China's response supposedly was, and Gates Foundation and GAVI Alliance are the main funders of the WHO.</p>

        <p>It's like the most famous Twilight Zone episode, where the girl is getting surgery to fix her supposedly horribly ugly face and the surgery is unsuccessful, yet when the bandages come off, she's hot.  It then gets revealed to the viewer that she lives on some other planet where everyone who looks "normal" has a hideous pig face and she's the hideous one in that world.</p>

        <p>As I’ve stated before they are counting test as positive cases. 
Any death in a hospital is counted as covid. 
You got 6 bullets in a gun. 5 I’m of those bullets are long term killers. 
Heart related issue. 
Diabetes 
High blood pressure 
High cholesterol
Lung issues . 
Bologna 19 aka covid 19 shows up and aggravates or increase issues in one of the others. You die from the hospitals negligence when you come in for one of the other 5 bullets and catch the 6th bullet. Now they count the 6th bullet as the only killer when you’ve been shot 5 other times. 
They’ve been trying to get trump out of office since day one with sex scandals, assistance from other countries and much more and then they figure toss in a media plague to turn the country upside down and see who lays like a turtle and who is a ostrich with their head in the sand (which they don’t  b it sake of conversation)</p>

<p>who was the last candidate, that had some traction, that wasn't a mass murdering freedom removing criminal? i guess ron paul.</p>

        <p>Wow, you praised Ron Paul, said virtually EVERY other candidate ever is a war criminal murderer (true facts, my dude) and get downvoted hard.</p>
<p>The Trump circle-jerk is still alive and well. People got conned and they’re embarrassed, but they’re doubling down. </p>
<p>I’m still wondering why when he had the senate majority for two full years he didn’t pass that reciprocity bill for licensed gun owners, but then I remembered people don’t actually hold their politicians accountable for the campaign promises they don’t do jack shit towards once they’re elected.</p>
<p>How are them pedo arrests going? Or is it because Q was disinformation and that T was one of them since the beginning? Trump, Clinton, and Prince Andrew are all friends and they all hang out with Epstein on his island to this day, since they faked his death and got him out of there.</p>

        <p>i mean i am not sure if they killed epstein or if he is still alive, but of course we both are certain, that he didn't kill himself :D</p>
<p>and yeah surprised by the downvotes too. i mean this sub is to small to make all of those bots and paid trolls, so really weird.</p>
<p>and yeah the Q and trump psyop still going strong.</p>
<p>don't worry my friend  within the next 2 weeks this certain mass murdering pedophile will save us all from the slavery, that he was directly involved in putting up.</p>
<p>let's just wait and sit back and ignore all the smart surveillance/prison grid coming online around us and the  forced injections of poisons and the removal of your right to breath properly.</p>
<p>JUST 2 MORE WEEKS! clinton will be arrest soon... again or sth. idk.</p>
<p>didn't you see trump was wearing or saying sth., that q said he would.</p>
<p>"TRUST THE PLAN!"</p>
<p>yeah really crazy, that anybody still falls for those psyops and lies. i guess the fluoride in the water and toothpaste and neurotoxins in vaccines and other sources are doing their job to prevent proper thinking of taking place :/</p>

        <p>Yeah, I’m just bullshitting about him being alive, who knows, but you’re right about the thing we both know :)</p>
<p>Nobody talks about that anymore though. Almost like the “Epstein didn’t kill himself” meme was bombarded so people would become desensitized to the issue and joke about it, instead of facing the reality that our leaders run a pedo ring and we should probably do something about it. </p>
<p>TRUST THE PLAN. DEFINITELY DON’T REVOLT, THAT WON’T WORK.</p>
<p>Edited to add: also did you know there are still people out there who think he <em>DID</em> kill himself? Most of them are doomers, though.</p>

        <p>&rt; also did you know there are still people out there who think he <em>DID</em> kill himself? </p>
<p>that is a terrifying thought....</p>
<p>and yeah maybe they pushed the joke part of the huge epstein story to try get people to accept it and move on.</p>
<p>i mean hell they are still trying to get the public to accept massive child sexualization and pedophilia. one example being the  "cuties" netflix film of course.</p>
<p>so the idea of just showing the people more of  epstein and cuties type stuff to get them to slowly accept it against their inner most natural reactions is certainly a possible strategy.</p>
<p>overall though the epstein story woke many people up to the child trafficking pedophila rings and the connections, so that is a great thing :)</p>

        <p>I’m no fan of Trump but I don’t think he’s 100% responsible. Yes he was an dick for not responding sooner but people are also responsible for their own health.  No one, the average citizen, Democrat or Republican political leaders  can control you.   It’s your responsibility to make sure your health is good.</p>

        <p>How early did you want him to do something? I never understood this argument. Fauci was coming out in Feb telling people not to wear masks and that we had no reason to be worried and Pelosi parading around chinatown saying it's totally fine everyone come on out. Meanwhile trump had already started banning travel end of Jan</p>
