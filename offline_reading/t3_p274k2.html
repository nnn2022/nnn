    <strong>"Those stupid rednecks are refusing to take the covid vaccine!"</strong>
    <p><p>When will this lie cease?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>" Covid vaccine hesitancy held constant in the most educated group (those with a PhD); by May PhDâ€™s were the most hesitant group. "</p>

<p>Also race wise, minorities are the most covid-vaccine hesitant. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study">This is partially because the US government purposely infected black servicemen with syphilis...for 40 years.</a></p>
<p>Ironic that they label people who reject the covid-vaccine to be white rednecks, when the majority of people rejecting it are black people who were experimented on by the government and people with PhD's.  </p>
<p>I've browsed r/coronavirus and a few other pro-clot shot subreddits and they literally never discuss this.  Either they know and don't want to talk about it, or they live in such a heavily moderated bubble that real information never shows up in their tunnel vision.</p></p>
