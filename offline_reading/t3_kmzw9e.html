        <p>Three months ago I resigned as an economist in the Victorian ¬≠Department of Treasury and ¬≠Finance to protest against disproportionate public health measures by Daniel Andrews that had led to a police state. Information has since become available that makes these policies even less ¬≠justified.</p>
<p>As I have written previously, this pandemic is not the Spanish flu. Data is now telling us that it is not even in the league of the Hong Kong flu.</p>
<p>In May, modellers had said Sweden would experience more than 100,000 additional deaths from COVID this year, with 96,000 additional deaths by July if lockdowns were not imposed.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Swedes, their policy is led by arguably the world‚Äôs best epidemiologist, ¬≠Anders Tegnell. He followed the standard approach found in all ¬≠official pandemic plans, including in Australia. Tegnell did not impose coercive lockdowns or close borders. And no masks, no quarantines. He tried to shield the elderly while flattening the curve by slowing the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Since Sweden is almost the only country in which the coronavirus was allowed ‚Äúto let rip‚Äù, this pandemic‚Äôs true magnitude will be conclusively known from its annual mortality statistics.</p>
<p>Official Swedish mortality data as at December 18 is available at https://www.scb.se/om-scb/nyheter-och-pressmeddelanden/scb-publicerar-preliminar-statistik-over-doda-i-sverige/. After controlling for recent under-reporting, I estimate Sweden will end up with about 97,000 deaths this year. Long-term trends suggest Sweden would have had about 92,500 deaths this year, so there will be about 4500 additional deaths this year, a far cry from the models.</p>
<p>Note that these 4500 excess deaths are well below the 8300 ¬≠officially reported COVID deaths to date. And these 4500 additional deaths are not all COVID deaths. Sweden‚Äôs Public Health Agency noted in October that ‚Äúthe 2019-2020 influenza season was mild‚Äù. As a result, 3419 fewer people died in Sweden last year than in 2018. Many of the frail among these 3419 survivors last year would have died this year anyway. Of its own accord, therefore, COVID has caused a much smaller number of deaths than these 4500 additional deaths. Sweden‚Äôs average two-year death rate in 2020 will be around 0.92 per cent, the second lowest in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>One struggles from this analysis to identify a serious pandemic in Sweden: just a bad flu, milder than the Hong Kong flu.</p>
<p>When I outlined this to an international panel on December 10, British MP Andrew Percy demurred and said the UK had experienced proportionately many more excess deaths than Sweden. It has, but analysis for nations other than Sweden needs to account for the additional deaths caused by the hysteria drummed up by governments and their coercive lockdowns.</p>
<p>As I have explained in my book, The Great Hysteria and the Broken State, and in my 68,000-word complaint to the International Criminal Court, lockdowns have likely killed two million people and shortened the lives of hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>Lockdowns kill in many ways, including by causing additional COVID deaths. For instance, the Victorian government spent most of its effort during the lockdowns in restricting the movement of the young, who were never at risk, while ignoring aged-care homes. This led to hundreds of avoidable COVID deaths. Australia‚Äôs governments went ‚Äúall in‚Äù on a hunch in March on the basis of models, all of which turned out to be wrong ‚Äî as they have always been in the past.</p>
<p>Our governments also shut their eyes to the data, which has been telling us a different story since mid-April, ending up in perhaps the biggest policy blunder in Australia‚Äôs ¬≠history.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have discovered during my research that community-wide cordons have been used only once in the past 500 years: for Ebola in 2014 in Africa. But only ‚Äúvery small-scale cordons‚Äù ‚Äî comparable to quarantines ‚Äî were found to be effective by an evaluation, not the larger-scale lockdowns. When lockdowns are rejected by the science even for a lethal virus such as Ebola, the idea of lockdowns being applied for a flu-like virus does not arise. That is why lockdowns were never part of any official pandemic plan, nor were indefinite international border closures.</p>
<p>Scott Morrison wants to keep Australia‚Äôs borders closed and freeze the virus at a level of zero until everyone is vaccinated. But such a policy is preposterous, apart from being unlawful. Section 5 of the Biosecurity Act 2015 states the ‚Äúappropriate level of protection for Australia is a high level of sanitary and phytosanitary protection aimed at reducing biosecurity risks to a very low level, but not to zero‚Äù.</p>
<p>In 2013, British epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta had shown that major pandemics are behind us because international cross-mingling boosts immunity. Minor vir¬≠uses, however, cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Are we going to close Australia for every bad flu in the future? We must get back the spunk we lost during this Great Hysteria and resume our normal life as a proudly rational, thinking Western nation. We must reassert our faith in freedom and reason, and end our embrace of the cowardly, totalitarian, zombie ways of the communist Chinese government.</p>
<p>Since 80 per cent of COVID deaths in Sweden have occurred among those over 75, people in this age group should continue to be sheltered and offered the vaccine. To mandate it for others would be yet another ¬≠display of intellectual and spiritual cowardice.</p>
