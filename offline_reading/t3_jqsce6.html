        <p>Hey there fellow Hank Hill! I sell propane as well! (well I just dispense it really but anyway...)</p>
<p>A few months ago when Ohio mandated masks I initially obeyed just because it had become normal around here.  I thought stores would try to make me leave if I didn't wear one... </p>
<p>Then one day I saw a lady at the grocery store shopping without one and no one said a word to her about it.... and then I took my mask off.  Just seeing one person resisting gave me the courage to follow suit. When emperor DeWine issued his mask decree there was near 100% compliance. Sadly it's still 80-90%...  Even most of my friends comply.  ðŸ˜  But half or more of the people wearing masks wear them in such a way they wouldn't work even if they were effective at stopping viruses. 
(I'll still wear it at a few places where the owner or management specifically asked me to. I don't go to those places often.)</p>
<p>I was a little self conscious about putting the message on my vehicle at first. My neighbors might think I'm crazy...  I don't really care. I think most people don't want a new normal, not this one anyway, they just haven't figured out that the people calling for it are serious and  they're going to to force it on us all... </p>
<p>If I can get one person to look into the great reset or to publicly say "No New Normal" then maybe they can too and we can stop this before it's too late.  That's what gave me the courage to do it. </p>
<p>Our future, our freedom, even our lives are at stake. More importantly, our children's and grandchildren's futuresâ€¦ It all depends on us waking up our friends and family and neighbors and coworkers.  They aren't even trying to hide what their agenda is anymore, they're literally publishing it. Klaus Schwab's got Sesame Street explaining the great reset to the children for fucks sake!  He's written multiple books on the subject and the WEF has made videos and published articles and built a ridiculously over-the-top website explaining what they're planning for the rest of us.  </p>
<p>Most regular people are too busy/distracted/deluded to notice the plan manifesting around them, but if we can show themâ€¦  It's not even our word against theirs (the elites that is), it's their own words!  What kind of psychopath says by 2030, "You'll own nothing and be happy!" (or else) and "Anything you want you'll rent" (from them of course) "and it will be delivered by drone" (so they don't have to employ delivery driversâ€¦) It's not hard to see that the only consideration they have for us is considering us uselessâ€¦ </p>
<p>Well I think I've ranted long enough for now.  Do you have any ideas how we can wake up our brothers and sisters?</p>

        <p>I'm not sure... I don't know the answer to wake people up, but it is difficult when no one will take you seriously because:</p>
<p>The problem is anything anti covid is grouped as the following:
conspiracy theorists, anti vaxxers, right wing extremists, flat earthers, climate deniers, neo nazis, selfish.</p>
<p>I almost think this whole anti vaxxer movement the past few years has been a setup/plant to demonize anyone who says no to even a dangerous and rushed vaccine. I would even go as far as to say the far right may have been a plant as well... but that is conspiracy zone. </p>
<p>I was worried about it back in early 2020 / late 2019 and I was careful but it was common knowledge masks didn't work. Then all of a sudden I wake up one day and everyone is wearing masks. I look at the fatality rates and it just doesn't seem much worse than the flu. There are absolutely no large scale studies showing cloth masks even work. Then I watched Ivor Cummins videos and that is what sold NoNewNormal for me.</p>

        <p>You do realize since they stopped putting everyone on ventilators its an anomaly for anyone moderately healthy and younger than the average life expectancy in the United States to die from covid-19 right?</p>
<p>You do realize it's incredibly destructive to place restrictions on everyone to protect to protect a tiny portion of the population is most at risk right?</p>
<p>You do realize that virtually shutting down hospitals for everything but emergencies and covid, eliminating millions of small businesses and the jobs they provide, restricting people's movement, and when the eviction moratorium ends making millions of people homeless will result in unimaginable misery and death right?</p>
<p>You do realize that the vast majority of the new cases are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and that as the number of cases goes up the infection fatality rate is plummeting right?</p>
<p>This is not to minimize the suffering of those who have died and grief of their loved ones at all. Thousands of people in the United States die every day and that sucks for the people grieving, but death is an inevitable part of life.</p>
