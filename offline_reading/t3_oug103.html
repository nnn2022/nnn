        <p>Nah they can't do it so easily in an armed populace. </p>
<p>They didn't do no / lite lockdowns in the red states because they chose not to. Its because a ton of scary looking guys with AR-15s showed up at freedom protests in front of the state Capitols in Michigan, Texas etc. and the politicians and cops with their 9mm glocks crapped themselves. </p>
<p>These guys aren't so tough when they're the ones being threatened. </p>
<p>The only way this happens in the states is if they either convince the public to hand their guns in after passing some law using another fake shooting like Orlando, Sandy Hook etc. using crisis actors. </p>
<p>Or, failing that, they bring in the UN / foreign troops etc. and start a war on American soil. They could try to use the US military itself but there's a high risk of mutiny when deploying soldiers against their own people, in spite of the heavy brainwashing in the military.</p>

        <p>It’s scary that a lot of people are speculating if the states go under another lockdown it will be far worse than the first. I feel like other countries set up the blue print for what will happen in a couple weeks for the states.</p>

        <p>I think Australia, New Zealand etc are panicking at the moment. They have put all their trust and pointed all their efforts on the vaccine saving them.
Now it seems that the vaccine doesn't provide nearly the same protection (or any protection at all)  as they hoped for and that would mean that Australia is effectively still at square one. That is, they have next to no immunity in the community, very many frail elderly and they have treated their people like prisoners and destroyed millions of quality years since this started </p>
<p>What is the plan now? Keeping restriction and keep jabbing people twice a year and letting the pandemic fade out over years to come instead of just dealing with it?  What a failed strategy they have had.</p>
<p>Now look at Sweden that have had AT LEAST 20% of the nation infected and thus have natural immunity. For the last five months the overall deaths have been around 7% lower than on a normal year. That just means that most of the ones that died from the virus last year were going to die soon either way. So we sacrificed a few months in the lives if the frail elderly instead of panicking and ruining many months/years of the lives of 10 million people. The pandemic is effectively over here as there are no rules left and no one wears a mask ever. </p>
<p>This is so clearly not about public health anymore. I wish people could see it and stop complying.</p>

        <p>They straight up cannot impose a 5km travel limit, everything is spread out too far and people would absolutely start rioting.</p>
