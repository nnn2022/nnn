    <strong>You can sleep with you partner but canâ€™t play tennis ðŸŽ¾ with them! Can shoot ducks ðŸ¦† but canâ€™t feed them!</strong>
    <p><p>Yesterday the chief executive of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust confirmed that in the countyâ€™s main hospital there are just <strong>seven</strong> patients suffering from coronavirus, three of them in intensive care.</p>
<p>Yet on the strength of that minuscule number of cases, a county of <strong>565,000</strong> people is being shut down. Businesses are again closing their doors and many will never reopen. Cornwall, like the rest of the country, is braced for a jobs bloodbath.</p>
<p>What we do know is that the average age of those dying â€˜with Covidâ€™ is 82.5 â€” <strong>a year older than the average life expectancy. (Evidence that Covid extends life by a year on average!)</strong></p>
<p>For instance, you can shoot ducks, but you canâ€™t feed them. You can sleep with your wife or husband, but you canâ€™t play tennis with them.</p>
<p>Figures out yesterday showed that more than <strong>3.5 million over-50s have had scheduled operations cancelled by Our Amazing NHS</strong>.</p>
