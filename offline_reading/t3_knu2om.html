    <strong>Someone should do an experiment where a group of people decide not to wear a mask in a store.</strong>
    <p><p>Like most of you, I despise wearing a mask. I only wear it in stores because there's a sign on the door (in my state anyway), and you'll get fined and/or they'll call the police if you don't wear one. Some worker at a Jewel Osco even gave me shit because I wasn't standing 6 feet behind the customer in front of me. Shut up, old lady. </p>
<p>I literally take my mask off the second I step out of any building,  and you will never see me wearing one in the parking lot or anywhere outside (unlike the fools who still wear a muzzle while putting food in their trunk). It's like those people can't think for themselves.</p>
<p>But anyway, I wonder if anyone has ever done an experiment like this - Let's say a store required muzzles, but a group of people (let's say two dozen people) decided to go against the grain and said screw wearing a mask and they all went shopping without one. Would be interesting to see if the store managers would do anything about it. Whatever their decision is, I bet those store employees would at least be relieved to see another human being, you know, actually smiling for once. I feel like many people want to go shopping without a mask, but they're more afraid of the shaming and consequences than anything else. Probably the same reason why those fools never take their mask off in the parking lot even though I rip mine off the second I walk out that door.</p></p>

        <p>Depends on the store manager. A lot simply won't sell to customers without a mask. However, I test the waters frequently. I'm in Tempe, AZ for the holidays. Been shopping at a grocery store without a mask since I got here. However, yesterday this young chubby employee decides to literally run up in my face as I enter the door. Funny 6ft didn't cross her little mind. She was hysterical. "Sir, Sir!!! You need a mask to shop here!" I simply said "no I don't, and call the cops" proceeded to shop as normal and go to self checkout no problems. </p>
<p>As I left she wouldn't even make eye contact. I assume she was put in her place by a manager. It's not a law bottom line.</p>

        <p>I don't wear one.  The stores in my state require it as well, but they can't enforce it.  I've had employees question me twice and I blew them off.  No one else has said anything.  I've had people glare at me, but that's it.</p>

        <p>&rt; Have you tested that policy yet?</p>
<p>Yep, twice.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I was at a Walgreens and I had forgotten my mask at home. But I went in the store anyway and shopped without a mask. The lady at the cash register was very friendly to me, treated me like any other customer, and didn't say a word about me having no mask.</p>
<p>Now on the opposite side, a few months ago I was over at a Panera Bread. I wore my mask when I was at the cash register taking my order, but I took it off when I went to the side window near the kitchen (where they give you the tray with your food). There was one customer standing there waiting for his food, and he had no mask on. So I thought "maybe I don't need to wear one" and I didn't. An older lady working in the kitchen behind the counter area noticed both of us without our masks on. She said angrily...</p>
<p>You.</p>
<p>Must. </p>
<p>Wear. </p>
<p>Your. </p>
<p>Mask!</p>
<p>Like sheesh, shut up old lady. Go back into the kitchen and make me a sandwich.</p>
<p>I guess it really depends on the store.</p>

        <p>As a small business owner, please just don't do this. The employees put up with enough shit already and a lot of state's mask mandates punish the business not the individual for non-compliance. Its one thing for one person to go in maskless, its a whole different thing when you start a protest. Take your frustration to your government who mandated it, not the businesses who have already been jacked around enough through all these regulations</p>

        <p>If the businesses are enforcing it to avoid getting fined or keep their licenses from being suspended what do you expect them to do? Lose their business or pay fines just to prove a point? The shut downs, capacity limits, and lost revenue already have a lot of these places teetering on the edge of permanent closure. We're not the ones who enacted mask mandates, we're not your enemy, we're just trying to keep the doors open, our employees employed, and our bills paid. Take your frustrations to the source of your issues, aka the government/officials who enacted all this in the first place.</p>

        <p>Your business is going to be bankrupt anyways when they decide to do another lockdown for whatever reason. All you have to do is put a sign up that says: </p>
<p>"Our store complies fully with the mandate however we are not allowed to ask if you have a medical condition that prevents you from wearing masks therefor we will assume that is the case to stay in full compliance with HIPPA <strong>laws.</strong> Whether you're wearing a mask or not, please keep appropriate distance at the request of customers or employees. Thank you!"</p>
