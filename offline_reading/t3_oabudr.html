    <strong>“Believing” in the VACS - the placebo &amp; nocebo effect</strong>
    <p><p>Read on..</p>
<p>Edit; <strong>I am against the experimental vaccines, but promoting excessive unsubstantiated fear in the vaccsinated can have detrimental effects.</strong></p>
<p>Our NNN community needs to recognize the importance of a real scientific phenomenon built into every pharmaceutical treatment or medication that has ever existed.</p>
<p>It’s called the placebo effect, and the nocebo effect. </p>
<p>It is the power of positive (or negative) thinking on physical health and well-being.</p>
<p>Whether or not you or someone you know has taken the vacs, it’s really important to maintain a positive state of mind.</p>
<p>This actually may be protecting people that took the vacs, ironically, because “believing” (feeling confident) in the medication is protective to an extent. </p>
<p>Being fearful, nervous, untrusting of a medication that a person has taken could have detrimental effects on health.</p>
<p>Just something to be mindful of.... as we are critical of the covid vacs, we need to be aware of this known phenomenon.  We shouldn’t be spreading fear <em>unnecessarily.</em>
i.e. not telling people that they will be dead in the next couple years.  Promoting excess fear in the vacsinated may be a self-fulfilling prophecy for future health problems. </p>
<p>Of course we need to continue to be informative and honest. </p>
<p>But if you are conversing with people who have <em>already</em> received the vacs, we should encourage positive thinking and moving forward while doing the best they can to maintain their health. </p>
<p>There is enough evidence proving that the vacs alone is dangerous to children and young adults (myocarditis), along with other risks regarding menstrual cycles, blood clots, body tremors etc. </p>
<p>At this point, I think that the placebo effect is having a greater impact because the vast majority of people taking the vacsine also believe in its effectiveness.  </p>
<p>The human mind is a curious thing. </p>
<p>Promote truth.  Educate people on the risks, but also on the importance of maintaining a healthy state of mind, regardless of the situation. </p>
<p>Let’s be the bigger person and not let our enemies “win” by letting them destroy us any further.   We know they’re dangerous.  But we don’t know to what extent.   We also know the power of the human spirit and mind.  Let’s not foster any self-fulfilling prophecies by envisioning/promoting mass injuries or fatality.   Promote the truth, spread the data that we know right now.  The future is still malleable.</p></p>

        <p>If you wanted the placebo effect, then using a proven safer treatment that might even be effective should have been encouraged... another reason to promote ivermectin. At the least it could have done this and been much safer than the vaccine.</p>
