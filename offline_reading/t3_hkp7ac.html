    <strong>Just a fun story about the changing perceptions of masks</strong>
    <p><p>When it was first starting out in March my now husband and I went to get our marriage license.   It was for a specific meaningful date.   I had just found out it was the last day the court was open for a while.   I was not sick but decided to be thoughtful and wear a mask.  This was before everyone was screaming to wear one.  </p>
<p>Well guess what, they didn’t let me in the courthouse because the mask “meant I was sick.”  </p>
<p>I wasn’t but even if I was, now everyone agrees that it doesn’t matter and the makes protect other from you so...</p>
<p>I offered to stay outside and sign the papers but they wouldn’t let me.   They then wasted our time until they closed early without telling us.   </p>
<p>We ended up saying vows privately on the date I chose and then eventually went through crazy bureaucracy and got a license in the mail and did it officially.  </p>
<p>Not shortly after that they wouldn’t let me in other offices if I WASN’T wearing a mask. </p>
<p>Amazing how perception can change so fast?  And no good deed goes unpunished.   Like the time I tried to wear a mask to be thoughtful and it messed up my wedding.  </p>
<p>I think it’s absolutely insane that the government would stop people from getting married.   This isn’t kindergarten.   I couldn’t believe more of them wouldn’t do write-ins.   Just because there is a pandemic doesn’t mean nanny state should say ah ah ah you can’t get married!  We didn’t have a wedding either just one officiant.  </p>
<p>I still haven’t changed my name because I can’t figure out how to do it mail in so I’ll have to go in person again but I really hate local government right now.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly can’t believe the incompetence. They’re standing right next to the data yet they don’t refer to it. Every severity metric down? Mask up. Sweden on the exact same curve as everyone else despite no lockdown? Better scream about the surge. It’s all narrative.</p>

        <p>Great point! Next time I think I’ll wear a mask into a public space and announce to everyone that I have a fever and feel like I “might have Covid.” Then we’ll see if they are cool, calm, and collected or if they lose their shit. My smart money is on them losing their shit and asking me to leave. Then we will need to have a conversation about how effective masks are.</p>

        <p>I tried to make this point on another sub. If masks are effective for stopping the spread, why do we quarantine people who have tested positive without symptoms? Or for that matter, quarantine people who CAME IN CONTACT with someone who tested positive.</p>

        <p>It's changed completely in the past week here. It's gone from voluntary and not a big deal to absolutely mandatory. </p>
<p>Businesses are enforcing it because they're afraid of being shut down. The change was shockingly fast. Apparently I'm a stupid piece of shit sheep for wearing one but I still need to go out and do shit and I'm not fighting everyone in my city. I just saw a guy told to fuck off at the gun shop because he didn't have a mask. No one there likes this rule but they don't want to lose their business. And I don't blame them. I'm right there in that boat with them.</p>

        <p>I wear one because I have asthma and I really don’t get the whole yelling at everyone else.  Like either they work or they don’t lol.  If they work then it shouldn’t matter if no one else wears one?  As long as I do?  And wash my hands and sanitize?  But somehow they can keep sneezes in but not out?  I don’t know.  I am pretty sure only the 95s and more hardcore ones actually really protect but at this point no one will be honest.   And I don’t get this whole “my mask protects you and yours protects me” thing now either.</p>

        <p>I actually had the 95 which I use bc I have asthma.   I am totally fine with choosing to do it myself because I have lung issues and it’s my choice.  I am not fine with it just being mandated.  I am still kind of mad that I tried to be a “good citizen” or whatever back when the media had not told everyone what to think about masks and then I got kicked out as “unclean”.  I just count my wedding date as the one we did privately anyway I’m an adult and while we did have to do the official paperwork and wanted to, Uncle Sam also doesn’t get to just tell me I’m not married on the sentimental date I wanted because I was bad and didn’t obey.</p>
