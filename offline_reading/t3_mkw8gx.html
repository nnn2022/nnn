<p>WOOW quote: "The White House has questioned those state laws, saying the rules are too strict and not guided by the science of Ebola. The virus is spread through bodily fluids and patients aren’t considered contagious until they’re showing symptoms of the disease."</p>
<p>More - just a few years back we actually believed it was a human right to leave your home while under quarantine for EBOLA: "Hickox was initially quarantined inside a tent in Newark before being allowed to leave for her home in Maine, where Gov. Paul LePage said he’d require her to remain inside her home for 21 days. Hickox said the state rules amount to a restriction on her civil rights and has threatened a legal battle over the mandated isolation."</p></p>
