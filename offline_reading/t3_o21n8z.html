    <strong>Reasoning for not getting it</strong>
    <p><p>When this all really started in March ‘20 in the US I was completely on the side of getting a shot when it’s available. I also “did my part” by staying inside and ordering delivery, etc. I laughed at “Novaxx” Djokovic for talking down about the shot. But a few months in, around May, I started getting back out. I got back into playing tennis (I try to play around 3-4 days a week) outside in the sun in a “hotspot” southern state - crazy how you lose all your stamina by being a hermit for a few weeks. Then the fall arrived, along with it consistent work travel, flying all around the US - which is still ongoing. Standing face to face with people, packing into a plane, etc. During our work travel, we’d eventually remove our masks in the conference rooms we were stationed in. Through the last few months I’ve removed my mask entirely, apart from airports / planes - still getting my tennis in whenever I can. I’m definitely on the side of the fence that believes Vitamin D and cardio is the real difference here, and not staying inside “doing my part” like a mushroom in a cave.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m just some random guy. Those are my 2 cents!</p></p>
