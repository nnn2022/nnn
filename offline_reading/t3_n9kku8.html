<p>Had  my first (and only) Moderna vaccine on FEBRUARY 28. Next day started  facial spasms, followed by very cold feet at night, followed by full  blown peripheral neuropathy of all 4 extremities and bulging veins that  has not shown any signs of abating. Plus tinnitus. Did the ER, PCP,  Neurologist circuit.  Got the usual we are â€˜stumpedâ€™ routine. <strong>I happily  went for my first vaccine and now I regret that day. My last neurologist  visit last week the doctor said it can take from months to years for  this neuropathy to go away. Very depressing.</strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™m sorry to hear. Do you feel it is improving, at least a little, or still getting worse?</p>

<p>Thanks  for your support. Itâ€™s so hard to say if thereâ€™s any improvement. I  need to take gabapentin just to sleep at night. I then wake up with numb  extremities. I donâ€™t wish this on any innocent people only  trying to  do the right thing.  <strong>I am a completely different person than I was  before that needle went into me.</strong></p>

<p>I had to copy and paste this. Sorry for the formatting. Was over at r/CovidVaccinated and this exchange was buried under OPs original comment.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but until people get to this point of regret, this will not end. As they say, bad news will travel around the world before good news can even get out of the blocks. There needs to be millions sharing their sincere regret over getting stuck with others around them to change the hive mind.</p>
<p><strong>This is also why "virtue signaling" is dangerous.</strong> Bad decisions have real consequences. But terrible decisions leaves one hopeless.</p></p>

        <p>Sorry this happened to you. Perhaps you are the right person to start a grass roots movement about these terrible side effects. Network with the right people to spread the word and get protection along with support.</p>
