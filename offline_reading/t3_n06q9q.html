        <p>It's pretty clear that based off of these screenshots that this is an active worldwide genocide and sterilization operation going on. If you can't see that by now then you are being willfully ignorant and just plain dumb.</p>
<p>And this is barely even a fraction of all of the posts in the Facebook vaccine injury groups. Now, imagine what is going to happen to all of these people who survived the jab 3 to 10 years down the road. I imagine a lot of them are going to pass away before 2030 and birth rates will be next to nothing due to the sterilization (right on time with their agenda and population reduction "predictions")  </p>
<p>Not sure how long these will remain on Imgur because as we all know big tech is working around the clock to keep these reports under wraps. So save them and share them far and wide!</p>

        <p>They are shedding- so you’re probably vaxed now. If you read what the CDC put out, this does shed, and it’s meant to for herd immunity. Stay away from these people. You will get it without consent and through their shedding of the mRNA.</p>

        <p>Those reports are so sad and tragic. They're being censored because anyone who read them would think twice about drinking poison koolaid. Thanks for sharing, even though they're hard to read. They're important and should not be erased.</p>

        <p>They always say "1 in a million".  But that's absurd, and everyone knows it.  The "odds" are clearly much higher than that, and actually depend entirely on the individual.  These vaccines will affect different people differently.  </p>
<p>This is one of the outrageous ways in how they present it.  As a percentage, like chances of a winning hand in poker.  That may work for poker, but to consider health in this way I think is very dangerous.</p>
<p>If these vaccines affect people even in the minor way of fatigue, brain fog, dizziness; this is a sign of neurological damage.  To pretend like this means nothing is absurd.  </p>
<p>Odds would suggest within a certain time period.  But really, it's for life.  You will have this vaccine inside you for life.  If there does turn out to be a problem with the vaccine, well...</p>

        <p>Exactly, I had someone tell me that only ppl with bad side effects post about it so it’s really not as bad as it looks. But what about all the ppl who aren’t online? It really just opened up to younger ppl so what’s been happening to the older and already ill or disabled population that took this thing months ago, and definitely weren’t posting online about it? It’s so messed up! The neurological side effects are especially scary, how can ppl really believe that’s normal?</p>

        <p>How do they know? They do not. The only time they tested this- years ago- every single animal died (ferrets mostly used) every single one. Now they roll out same thing only with 19 on the end, and pass up every trial, went straight to humans based on what “experts” told them. It’s an experiment and should be disclosed as such. When you hear all this “it’s a rare side effect” “it’s only a small percentage” based on what? I’ve yet to get a response. This vaccine has not even been available for half the time that it should be tested in an emergency situation- 5years is what that is, normal testing is 10-15 years at the least.</p>

        <p>I’m sure nothing could go wrong with tricking your body’s own cells into producing spikes that get attacked by your immune system. Anyone who says otherwise is obviously a conspiracy theorist.</p>
