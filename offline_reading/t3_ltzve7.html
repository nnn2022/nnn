    <strong>The whole anti vax rhetoric with the covid vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>The way the media and government officials are treating people who are questioning the covid vaccine and would prefer to wait until more testing is done or don't even want it at all is disgusting.</p>
<p>Now I have always been pro vax for most of my life, as I believe For all of the other vaccines that have been created over the years for horrible diseases and conditions, they work.the science is there, the research has been done, they have been tested and tested and tested for years.</p>
<p>But with the covid vaccine? I refuse to take a vaccine that has been rushed, skipped vigorous proper prolonged testing just so we can apparently go back to "normal". But we all know it's not going to be the real normal, as per quotation marks. I refuse to bow down to the government and media and be a good little human drone all for the greater "good". I find it disgusting how the media and government is treating people who are questioning the vaccines and acting like we are the worst people in the world. And even if we get a vaccine, we still have to socially distance and wear masks? What is the fucking point? </p>
<p>I guess its  either one or the other according to the government and to be honest I dont want either.
These lockdowns  have destroyed small businesses and peoples livelihoods. Guess what businesses are still going strong? That's right  its the big businesses and the millionaires that just got richer from this pandemic. Its time to reopen and not keep locking down like what is happening in new Zealand and Australia when there are only a few cases that pop up.</p></p>
