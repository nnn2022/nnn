    <strong>People truly are stupid</strong>
    <p><p>Went to get icecream with my girlfriend. The store owner set up a desk to pay outside the front doors... thinking she wasn't an idiot I walked up without a mask. She said "oh perfect day to come get icecream isn't it? You must've forgot your mask cause you guys took your motorcycle here. Here you go." <em>hands me mask to stand outside</em> <em>I accept tonnot cause a scene</em></p>
<p>As im ordering she asked what we were doing in the county. We had just finished visiting a Canadian provincial park to which I explained the bird tower was shut down due to covid restrictions that make no sense as the tower is outside.. her employee wearing a mask says "oh its probably just to limit crowds". I answer with "there is not one piece of evidence showing anyone has gotten covid outside". She responds with "yeah but there is only so much room up there and you can't properly socially distance". I dont say anything as my comment is disregarded and I know im dealing with idiots.</p>
<p>The employee proceeds to go on break, walk outside and take her mask off to light a cigarette, the perfect trigger for what actually causes people to die that contract covid.</p>
<p>My girlfriend and I laughed.</p>
<p>On the bright side; Earlier in the day we went into a restaurant in the county thats defying restrictions. Tons of elderly people maskless, young people maskless, nobody asking any questions despite us being in a lockdown. It was nice. Still pending supposed covid symptoms from this gathering.</p></p>
