<p><em>Interview on 60 Minutes:</em></p>

<p><strong>Transcript:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kroft: “My understanding is that you went … went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Soros:</strong> “Yes, that’s right. Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>Kroft:</strong> “I mean, that’s — that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years. Was it difficult?”</p>
<p><strong>Soros:</strong> “Not, not at all. Not at all. Maybe as a child you don’t … you don’t see the connection. But it was — it created no — no problem at all.”</p>
<p><strong>Kroft:</strong> “No feeling of guilt?”</p>
<p><strong>Soros:</strong> “No.”</p>
<p><strong>Kroft:</strong> “For example, that, ‘I’m Jewish, and here I am, watching these people go. I could just as easily be these, I should be there.’ None of that?”</p>
<p><strong>Soros:</strong> “Well, of course, … I could be on the other side or I could be the one from whom the thing is being taken away. But there was no sense that I shouldn’t be there, because that was — well, actually, in a funny way, it’s just like in the markets — that if I weren’t there — of course, I wasn’t doing it, but somebody else would — would — would be taking it away anyhow. And it was the — whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away. So the — I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.“</p>

        <p>I hate Snopes so much.  You have to read through about 15 paragraphs before they get to pointing out that he did, in fact, help nazis seize property from jews, but not in the exact way that Snopes decided to interpret the claims on social media so they can justify labeling it false.</p>

        <p>The one thing I have to give them credit for is they almost always provide a decent overview of the topic and cite their sources, so I usually still feel informed after reading them.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you stop reading at "True/False" it can be extremely misleading.</p>

        <p>Snopes original idea was good, in which it was only a repertory to find if some random claim that was made on the internet even existed, and to basically find out were it originally came from.</p>
<p>Now it is just a propaganda machine.</p>
<p>Basically they use the most outrageous and obviously wrong form of a claim, and use that to basically disprove the original claim.</p>
<p>In the case of this, basically they use the false claim that he was a member of the SS done apparently by one single Twitter user, to disprove that he did anything supporting the Nazi party.</p>
<p>Now most of their time they do mental gymnastics as to explain why something someone did said, or did do is not really what is claimed to be, basically telling you that your eyes and ears are all fucked up, and you do not know shit.</p>
<p>If anything, for the claim that Soros helped the Nazi to take away properties, I would go as far as to put it as "mixture" or "mostly true" and just clarify things like his age, and the background of how that came to be.</p>

        <p>So how exactly did George help the nazis? He was 14 years old in 1944 and he literally says “I was only a spectator - I had no role in taking away that property”. How is that helping them? What was he as a 14 year old Jew supposed to do?</p>

Edit: I'm talking about the person on the top half of the photo.
Second edit: I'm not saying that the guy on the bottom was less insane, but he looks more normal at least.</p>

        <p>It's funny that they're so convinced they're doing the right thing. So were the people snitching in Germany I suppose... most of them wouldn't have been card carrying Nazis, they just had been told that was the right thing to do and they believed it. They have no critical thinking skills and no desire to question what they are told.</p>
