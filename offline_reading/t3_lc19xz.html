    <strong>[Germany] Eventim will only allow vaccinated people on their concerts in the future</strong>
    <p><p>This is it boys. The circus has opened its bch ass doors completely. They have taken everything from me. I don't want to make this personal but I'm not lying when I say concerts have been one of the only things keeping me on this planet. All my hopes are ruined.</p>
<p>They labelled us "conspiracy theorists" for predicting these things months ago. I see people on Twitter calling mandatory vaccination a blessing and a wonderful thing. Imagine thinking the government works in your interest. Imagine di√ßk riding these absolute liars so much as if they would give you something in return. They're ruining our all lives and these clowns are applauding them for it</p>
<p>I want to fucking die</p></p>
