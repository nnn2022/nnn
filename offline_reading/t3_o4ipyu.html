    <strong>Just some optimistic points...</strong>
    <p><p>obviously many of us know the media is full of sh*t, so remember that when youre reading about vaccination stats, or when you see some draconian post from a ghoul politician getting too many upvotes. its almost definitely all exaggerated or inflated for the purpose of convincing people to cave and get the vax. theres an article on here from politico about how the (ridiculous) vax lotterys arent working as consistently or effectively as hoped. there is still much on the agenda with the upcoming delta strain, so there must still be much to do if depopulation is the final goal. dont get discouraged, and spread as much dependable info to anyone who will listen!</p></p>
