        <p>“The league said Harden violated those rules when he attended a "private indoor party" </p>
<p>Good luck trying to enforce this all season. They couldn’t even make it to the first game without an incident.</p>

        <p>&rt;  he attended a "private indoor party"</p>
<p>This reminds me of what I read about people that worked for Henry T Ford. He would have people go inspect the workers' houses. Also, they had to "behave" a certain way off the clock. Everything they did reflected the company. Creepy ass shit.</p>
<p>&rt;To qualify for his doubled salary, the worker had to be thrifty and continent. He had to keep his home neat and his children healthy, and, if he were below the age of twenty-two, to be married.</p>
<p>&rt;Henry Ford wanted his workers to be model Americans, and to ensure that, he created a division within the Ford Motor Company to keep everyone in line. </p>
<p>&rt;Investigators would show up unannounced at your home, just to make sure it was being kept clean. They’d ask questions that were less appropriate of a car company, than they were for the modern-day CIA. They’d query you about your spending habits, your alcohol consumption, even your marital relationships. They’d ask what you were buying, and they’d check on your children to make sure they were in school.</p>
<p>That is going to be our future if we dont fight!</p>

        <p>The worker of the 4th Revolution is reminiscent of the proletariat of the 1st. But at least the proletarian had a house and kids; the ones of the future will live in pods brainwashed to think having kids destroys the planet.</p>
