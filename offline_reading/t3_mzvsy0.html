    <strong>I think you guys are wrong, but I agree with you on one major thing</strong>
    <p><p>Look, I think a lot of people here spread misinformation and try to act like tough guys. Hate me if you want, after this I'll go on with my life and so will you. </p>
<p>So that begs the question: why am I here? Just to insult you? No. I don't think you guys are bad people, I just don't agree with you. </p>
<p>I'm here because this is the only community that acknowledges THE FUCKING DOOMERS who LOVE this pandemic. </p>
<p>Yes, I am pro vax (my organs are failing already) as you might guess. I take it many people here are not going to get vaccinated. I don't care, that's your choice and your health to deal with. </p>
<p>What I don't understand is why so many vaccinated people are hesitant to get back to normal life. I had someone tell me "you could still spread it after you get vaccinated".... um what????</p>
<p>All evidence suggests the vaccine stops the spread, you don't have to believe me, but it does. If vaccines didn't stop things from spreading, polio would still be around. </p>
<p>Why are doomers so in love with the pandemic? I have my theories. </p>
<p>For one, it's way worse on reddit than in real life. All of my friends have mostly gone back to normal since getting vaccinated. We don't have to worry about killing our parents anymore, so we're done. </p>
<p>But why are so many people on reddit in LOVE with this pandemic? Because they don't have to feel guilty about doing nothing with their lives. </p>
<p>You don't have to feel bad about stagnating in your career, in your relationships, in your life. Because the world is standing still. Instead of working on social anxiety and trying to live a fuller life, you've been hailed as a hero for the past year. </p>
<p>It's a disgusting phenomenon. I appreciate you guys for acknowledging this and calling it out. </p>
<p>Look, outside of reddit, a lot of us "sheeple" just want to get back to normal. We want to go into a shop without a mask, not worry about 6ft, travel, etc. Fuck doomers for championing this totally fucked up, unfortunate, and abnormal way of life. </p>
<p>I'm vaccinated, I cannot spread it, and I'm done putting my life on hold. Whatever you choose to do with your life, good luck.</p></p>

        <p>A few touch points mentioned and appreciated:</p>
<ol>
<li>My body, my choice.</li>
<li>Sky is always falling for losers, aka Sheeple and Doomers, because they don’t have to feel guilty about doing nothing with their lives.</li>
<li>No means no.  Forcing people to do anything against their will just to make you feel good or satisfy your needs is wrong and disgusting.</li>

        <p>It’s really sad. The few comments that said it’s time to go back got downvoted to hell. We are already living in a society that is getting more and more antisocial even without this pandemic. I’m appalled at how many people are just accepting this new way of life as “the new normal” and even “ a good thing” in some cases. I am so grateful that I have been fortunate enough to get up and go to work everyday throughout this and actually see other humans. And this is coming from a very introverted person! I’d go insane if I never had to leave the house.</p>

        <p>Correct, that's what's the evidence says so far. Perhaps longer, time will tell. </p>
<p>If not, then it becomes like the flu shot. Get it if you care to protect yourself. If not, that's your business.</p>
<p>If thats the case I just hope it actually gets treated like the flu. No more lock downs or anything else</p>

        <p>I agree... If it is a flu shot, as it appears to be, then I would think a lot of the people screaming ANTI-VAX would rethink their ways. They wont though. I'm sure many will never get another one once they realize it's every 6 months.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I think that's one of my biggest issues. People aren't willing to relax.  They take the vaccine and then still just don't feel safe.  It's unfortunate, but it's mostly because they obediently devoured mainstream media who are profiting from all the fear they have sown.  It sells.  Instead of thinking about their actual risks versus reward, they continue to buy the narrative that everything is awful and deadly and the vaccine does nothing, but get it anyhow.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you have some kind of immunity from having covid or the vaccine, you are unlikely to get covid again.  However, if they accept that, then there's no reason for them to treat unvaccinated like vermin.  They would have to let people get back to their lives and all the attention, power and revenue they cultivated through the pandemic would evaporate.</p>
<p>I was scared until I looked at the actual numbers.  If my pre-existing conditions ha me have a very high chance of death like I thought it might be at the pandemic, I would have gotten a vaccine... but at this stage I'm not worried about covid and extremely worried about months of side effects potentially from the vaccine.  It's a personal issue that taps into a lot of my personal fears.  I can't just overcome those for the convenience of other people.</p>

        <p>I really appreciate your post.  I think you'll find a great many people will agree with much of what you say and I hope your comments are welcomed in this subreddit because a lot of what you say hits the nail on the head about why many of us here are so angry at what's going on.</p>
<p>I think the reputation of NNN is different from what actually gets discussed here most of the time, and other subs have categories for us such as no new normal being dangerous and similar titles.  I don't think they realise that much of what goes on here is light-hearted ways that we come up with of laughing at what we see is the madness going on around us, just like other subs laugh at us.  Parody and satire is essential in any democracy and a key part of free speech, and this seems to have got lost on the doomers.  There are a wide range of political perspectives here, and you'll also find that there are significant differences too with NNN contributors from the US compared with other parts of the world as well as other factors that bring people here in the first place.  People are so angry they want to ban this sub, and make a free speech exception for the thing they don't agree with, it's a strange moral high ground to try and take...</p>
<p>The fundamental point is that we oppose the current restrictions becoming permanent, that's what we all really care about hence No New Normal.  You said in your post that after this you'll go back to your life and so will we, but right now this is definitely not a certainly and is looking unlikely because of the degree to which many measures previously seen as unconscionable have been accepted by the majority.  Not only that, but like you say they are actively pushing for it to continue.  Governments all over have a taste for it now, and behind the scenes they will be thinking about how to keep the new found control they have over the population. Previously only countries like China and North Korea could dream of such control.  That's why we question every measure, every aspect of the 'science' that is unproven, the effectiveness of masks etc.  It's also why many of us would choose liberty and death or risk of death over security but with a life not worth living.</p>
<p>Symbols of compliance are now more important to people than the infection rates, survival rates, r-rate etc. and we feel they have lost sight of the simple goal from day one which was to prevent overflow of hospitals, not to be prevent death from covid (not a single epidemiologist has publicly stated that this disease can be eradicated). Now 1 death anywhere is 1 too many, but the same logic is not applied to other diseases or conditions.  </p>
<p>The fact that we now have such moralising over whether or not someone wears a mask or not truly shows the governments have won because we're arguing about that rather than what got us in this situation in the first place.   I wouldn't be surprised if we are not far from where we are now in 3-5 years time but with hardly any deaths, but with a large chunk of the public still too scared to go out and not allowing anyone near them, winter lockdowns, masks indoors etc.  I really hope I'm wrong but right now I believe that the only thing that will prevent that is fighting back harder and more aggressively than I have ever had to do before.  Our rights will not be given back to us just because we had them before and my fear is that when people finally wake up to that it will be too late.  And what's truly the most terrifying: that? Or a virus with a 99.8+ survival rate.</p>

        <p>Thanks for taking the time to write this. Some interesting insight here. I think you hit the nail on the head when you said people are more concerned with symbols of compliance than actual infection and death rates. </p>
<p>I too am becoming concerned that some people will want to maintain aspects of this far beyond what is reasonable. </p>
<p>In my mind, at a certain point we have to accept that everyone has made up their mind about whether they'll get the vaccine or not. And get the hell back to normal. </p>
<p>I share your concern that measures may continue in order to prevent any death at all. But I hope we are wrong indeed!</p>

        <p>Good question. The majority of the people in my life have come to a similar conclusion to me. That once you're vaccinated, there's no reason to worry anymore. </p>
<p>Me and my friends think it's pretty reasonable to eliminate most restrictions over the summer. I definitely hope to see masks gone by the holidays. If this stuff spills into 2022, I would consider that some nanny state bullshit.</p>

        <p>Hopefully there will be very few people left who want to keep restrictions by the time summer comes then.  It's just so hard to tell what anyone thinks when people appear to support the rules and the media only does scaremongering stories.</p>
<p>In the UK now they are talking about a third wave with 10s of thousands of deaths despite ALL the vulnerable groups having had 2 vaccines by the summer.</p>

        <p>Yep you're right, it does indeed take between 5 to 10 years to develop a drug or vaccine. The bottleneck however is usually funding. The people researching the drug usually have to plead their case to the pharma company and convince them its worth pumping more money into it. That process can get pretty bureaucratic.</p>
<p>But since this was a considered a health emergency, they had all the money in the world right away and the bottleneck was removed.</p>
<p>mRNA technology has been in studies since the 2000s as a promising treatment for various conditions ranging from diabetes to cancer. </p>
<p>Theres also a basis for these specific vaccines based on other viruses in the coronavirus family.</p>

        <p>Fair enough friend, here are the two main points: </p>
<p>The coronavirus is very overwhelmingly survivable by most age demographics, especially the youngest demographics. </p>
<p>https://www.hartgroup.org/22-april-2021/</p>
<p>The vaccine is actually more dangerous, albeit slightly, to otherwise completely healthy individuals, especially the elderly, who are being pushed this mRNA poison.</p>
<p>https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/297051</p>
<p>https://newtube.app/user/NoNewAbnormal/eaOjH0d</p>
<p>That final video details what an mRNA vax does, essentially putting your immune system in an overactive state when it encounters COVID <em>or a similar virus.</em> That means when the vaccinated catch another strain of coronavirus their immune system will essentially try to destroy them.</p>

        <p>Well, I didn't make any claims here, so I don't think I can't be wrong about anything.</p>
<p>My perspective is as follows:</p>
<p>I cannot confirm what the media tells us about covid with my own perception of what is happening around me.
Because of that I'm not afraid of contracting covid.
I have no problems with other people being afraid and acting accordingly.
What I do have a problem with, is that it is expected from me to act as if I was afraid.
That I'm told what and what not to do. That I'm no longer allowed to act according to my own conclusions but instead according to those of others.
I don't like authority. Except for when I want advice and can pick myself whom to listen to.
I want to reclaim agency over my own life-decisions and others to cease forcing and manipulating me to act against my self-determination.</p>
<p>All of that is independent from what I and others consider to be true or not.</p>
