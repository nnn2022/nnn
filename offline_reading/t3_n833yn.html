    <p><p>Brandy Vaughan, who spoke out against vaccines and "died" of natural causes at 44, talks about pharma marketing here at 30:06 - https://youtu.be/KzpdaJgjh8c?t=1809.  The whole video from 2016 is great - she clearly knew that adult vaccines were next.</p></p>

        <p>I think we have to start posting things everywhere, but not online. Social media is censored and controlled, we couldn't gain traction. Notices put up all over your town, to wake people, to get them questioning, and to let other awake people know they are not alone, and maybe not even the minority. It should be simple messages, nothing so outlandish so as to turn away people prejudiced against "conspiracies". Simple, clear messages to get people thinking. We could put them up and replace them faster than they can be taken down. Make their presence as omnipresent as the mainstream propaganda. Simple questions and statements illustrating things that are painfully obvious to us, but that others seem not to have questioned. I think if we are to wake up the masses, it will have to be on the streets. Post truth everywhere. We have to counter the propaganda by being just as pervasive. Every post on every intersection. It's a waste of time posting memes on a sub where everyone is already aware. When everyone is awake, it's over</p>
