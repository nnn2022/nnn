        <p>First off, I know the CDC releases a lot of information beneficial to our cause. However, they also release a lot of information that is contradictory, and also against their own narrative. Same goes for Fauci, and WHO.</p>
<p>Also, yes, there is a rush to force this vaccine. They won't stop pushing it, and they will not stop censoring or otherwise squashing any threats to their agenda. </p>
<p>The unfortunate fact is that people are falling for this, and seem to be going full steam ahead with the vaccine efforts. Sure, there are some who are not, but many seem to support the upcoming vaccine, even some in our group who view the vaccine as the ticket back to normalcy. </p>
<p>What's the solution? I can't say for certain. I think the next step is we move the fight off the internet, and begin to gather numbers offline for education, and protesting efforts. However, we have an uphill battle, that's for sure.</p>

        <p>This isn't going to change their minds.</p>
<p>They will say oh well, even if the other 94% didn't die "solely" from covid, they'd still be alive if it weren't for covid</p>
<p>I'm not agreeing with it, but I'm 100% sure that's the position they would take.</p>

        <p>I'm not agreeing with it because it's a flawed position to take, whatever the number of deaths happens to be doesn't change that fact. people putting aside all rational thought due to fear instilled by scary numbers is a big part of the problem here. I'm not from there though, it's not "my country"</p>

        <p>A lot of memes and statements are flying around social media right now claiming that new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows that just 6% of the people reported to have died from covid 19 had covid 19 as the sole cause of death, meaning 94% had one or more other health problems that contributed to their death. The censors on Twitter, Facebook and other networks have been busy as well squashing these memes.
     But the CDC's own data verifies this claim, "Table 3 shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death."
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm?fbclid=IwAR39DH6f3o2qnSD4E4lB6sCpEofqFwo-mEAMs3t-KGO1DTowYlav_xyUq5s
     We know from Dr. Deborah Birx that many of the approximately 180,000 of the claimed covid 19 related deaths were presumed to be covid 19 even though no test was performed, and many others were listed as covid 19 deaths even though the actual cause of death was something else like cancer, heart attacks, and in some cases gunshot wounds.
     Does this mean that covid 19 is not a serious health issue?  Of course not. But it does mean that we need to look much more carefully  and thoroughly at the data we have and stop the hysteria, which has led to a series of catastrophic decisions like putting people on ventilators, cramming people with active cases of covid 19 into nursing homes, and obliterating the economy. The next major hysteria (and greed) generated bad decision facing us is forcing everyone to get an experimental covid 19 vaccine, vaccines that are already in production even though safety and efficacy studies done at warp speed are incomplete and have troubling preliminary results</p>
