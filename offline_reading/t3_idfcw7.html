        <p>I'm starting to have a greater disdain for millennials than any other generation. Boomers weren't good either, and the first of the zoomers are alright. The newer zoomers suck ass. But fuck millenials. They're the demoralized, authoritarian weirdos that continue to push this mess.</p>

        <p>I am a Millenial and i’m fighting as hard against this as i can, but in general i think you’re right i do live in a very liberal country that has never really experienced Authoritarian rule before 2020.  So i just don’t think most people realize that this is what these rules are.  Both young and old hopefully that changes soon though</p>

        <p>The masks and safety guidelines are not authoritarian. </p>
<p>During WW1 however, it was <em>illegal</em> to criticize the United States or speak out against our involvement. That is Authoritarian. Notice how everyone here can say whatever they want about this situation without being thrown in the gulag.</p>

<p>Not a strawman, because I'm saying that 100 years ago, talk like this would have you thrown in jail, which is so much worse than being being banned from a subreddit. I haven't mis-represented your arument in any way. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's not censorship because you are using a private company's message board. You have the <em>privilege</em> of using reddit but you have no right to. Just like a store has the right to refuse to service to whomever they choose, so does a privately owned website. Also, these boards are made willy-nilly. The rules are decided by the moderators, not some legal board. It's like joining a pick-up game of basketball and then decrying racism when you're kicked out for traveling too much.</p>

        <p>Gotta disagree chief. The mayor of LA cutting off power to houses and businesses that have unauthorized gatherings is authoritarian. Oahu banning any kind of social gathering, despite Hawaii having some of the lowest numbers in the country, is authoritarian. </p>
<p>Hell my own city of Duluth, Minnesota threatens to slap people with misdemeanor charges for mask violations. Same level as a DWI or basic assault. That is authoritarian. Just because you can speak out against it doesn't mean it isn't authoritarian. Luckily it hasn't gotten to that point yet, although I wouldn't be the least bit shocked if it did.</p>

        <p>If they do work, why did every state in the US follow the same 8-10 week rise and fall in cases, regardless of lockdowns or mask mandates? If they work, why did California have a spike in cases months after they were mandated? And don't say "because people don't comply."

        <p>The medical community has advocated the wearing of masks for sanitary reasons for almost 100 years. Just let that sink in. If masks were useless, don't you think someone would have said <em>something</em> since then? Not advocating for them just as much a century later?  </p>
<p>Well, in my opinion, it's a multitude of reasons. You can't blame people entirely for not taking the pandemic seriously because the President's administration wasn't taking it seriously. The U.S. reaction to covid was incredibly lax compared to that of other countries. The testing was behind, it was too late to start contact tracing, governors were essentially on their own with how to lead their constituents. There was a shortage of medical supplies, small businesses that needed PPE loans were not receiving them, some people literally were and still are not given the chance to quarantine or stay home due to financial burdens. </p>
<p>Like that right there is a clusterfuck. That makes reacting to any infectious disease almost impossible.</p>

        <p>Someone has said something. The lead epidemiologist of Sweden thinks masks do more harm than good. Ioannidis and others have their doubts. The NYT survey that asked doctors what they thought about masks had 511 doctors respond. 52% thought they were necessary, 48% didn't. That's not a strong majority. That's indicative of something that's, at best, inconclusive. </p>
<p>To me it seems masks are a placebo, a placebo that many people are getting <em>very</em> angry about others not utilizing. That's due to, in part, governments being on an aggressive campaign calling people that don't wear masks nothing short of murderers.</p>

        <p>So I've looked at just about everything you said data-wise and I think there's a strong possibility you're misinterpreting what some of these people and surveys are saying. None of them say that a medical mask is ineffective when attempting to prevent the spread germs or a virus.   </p>
<p><strong>Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist at Sweden’s Public Health Agency</strong> - <strong>“<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/19/swedens-tegnell-wearing-face-masks-may-be-very-dangerous/">Face Masks</a> can be a complement to other things when other things are safely in place,” he said. “But to start with having face masks and then think you can crowd your buses or your shopping malls — that’s definitely a mistake.” 
</strong>
He's not arguing against face masks. He's arguing against complacency. As in, if your country still has a high number of infected, it's a better idea to avoid crowds altogether then believe that masks will cure the problem. Although he also refused to lock down his country and a lot more people died than the countries neighboring his. </p>
<p><strong>John Ioannidis</strong> - <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/prophet-of-scientific-rigor-and-a-covid-contrarian/">Ioanndis</a> insists there’s little evidence that hospitals couldn’t now handle the surges that might come from relaxing stay-at-home policies, assuming people who go out take moderate protection measures such as <strong><em>masks</em></strong> and social distancing. </p>
<p><strong>511 Epidemiologists</strong> - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/08/upshot/when-epidemiologists-will-do-everyday-things-coronavirus.html">This one</a> was tricky because the 52% I think you're referring to (there were multiple surveys) was suggesting that we may be able to stop wearing masks A YEAR from that moment. The article was published in June, so it's likely that those doctors were thinking that we'll be okay to stop wearing masks next April or May</p>

        <p>Right a virus that isn’t deadily to the majority of the world’s population, totally justifies shutting down people’s essentials like Water and Electricity, i bet those people who get to experience this feels alot more safe.  I know that i’d feel very safe if my goverment did this too people🤦🏻‍♂️</p>

        <p>If people accept this, then they’ll accept worse.  So yeah it sets a dangerous precident.  </p>
<p>Which is why disobidence is actually a good thing in regards to Goverment over reach like we’re seeing in 2020 all over the world.  Politicians stop trying this shit.  When we have had enough.  The public loses all power by compliance, saying no and protesting etc is how these things end,  after all a nations population tend to outnumber Politicians, Law enforment and millitary.   The People have the power, Goverment just has power as long as the population are obedient slaves</p>

        <p>I'm a zoomer and I feel like I'm the only one who does oppose this dystopia. Pretty much most of my friends are non skeptics. If they're is one good thing that ce out from these lockdowns, it's the pulling of the curtain to see what the people around you actually are. A friend of mine that I would have considered to be very close and would constantly check up on my mental health basically gave no shit after I told her what lockdowns were doing to people. I sort of made it clear that I was referring to myself in those examples I gave, but she only gave a passive aggressive "lol, okay" as a response. Ever since that day I've minimised my time talking to her, and she did apologise after days of me ghosting her but that left a really bad taste in my mouth that I still can't seem to get rid of.</p>

        <p>I still actuly wish this virus was worse.I know that sounds terrible but long term it would be better for the world and everyone in it.Read about post plague europe.For the people that were left it was actuly awsome.In part it contributed to the renaissance.Feudalistic systems were broken.Upward mobility of the average person increased.Wages,economic growth,consumer goods were obtainable for average people..So much of what we have today started because the plague shook up society.Imagine the same effect on the modern world.</p>
<p>The problem is most people who said the same kind of stuff I am are afraid of their mortality.When they say it they assume they'll end up on the other end alive and well.When they're met with the idea of "oh no I might be one of the poor bastards that doesn't make it" they end up scared and change their opinion to follow suit.</p>
