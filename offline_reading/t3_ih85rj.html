        <p>Oh, so mask DO protect the wearer now?? Great news! Now everyone who is concerned about getting covid can wear a mask, since it now apparently protects the wearer, and stop worrying about whether other people wear masks or not.</p>

        <p>They apparently were wearing the Korean equivalent of N95 masks.</p>
<p>I wish there weren't such a shortage of high grade N95 or better masks. Then the people who give a crap about their own health/safety could wear them, and people like you could STFU and catch it if you wish.</p>
<p>It's not that simple right now though. N95s are in short supply, so now we have the mask wars because cloth masks just aren't the same thing.</p>

        <p>This disease is not deadly enough to necessitate people wearing n95 masks. But i have no problem with people deciding to wear masks because they don't want to get sick. More power to them. Let them wear hazmat suits. But there is no need for the government to worry about any kind of mask policy.</p>

        <p>Really I would like it to be that way. N95 masks for those who really don't want to take chances with a novel virus, no matter how "non-deadly".</p>
<p>Nevermind the mask policies, personally I think it does reduce spread. The N95 shortage really complicates the issue though, hence the mask wars, which I don't really care for. I'd rather just wear my P100 and let others decide their fate.</p>

        <p>Based on <em>four</em> employees. 56 cases were linked to the Starbucks, and they didn't say out of how many total customers there were. Four employees didn't get it. That could be any of the following:</p>
<p>-Plain old good luck</p>
<p>-Already had an asymptomatic case and recovered without knowing, now immune</p>
<p>-Resistant to the virus because they got a different coronavirus recently (last couple of years?)</p>
<p>-The masks helped</p>
<p>-Social distancing helped</p>
<p>-Good hand hygiene helped</p>
<p>-They didn't get enough of a viral load to cause illness because the infected customer(s) were in the dining area far away from them</p>
<p>What's the breakdown of sick customers who were wearing a mask and who weren't? How many customers came through there? Did the employees get antibody tests? We'd need to know that before jumping to conclusions about what protected the employees.</p>
<p>56 out of 60 customers would suggest there was something different about the employees (maybe behavior, maybe immunity), but if it's 56 out of 300 then four employees not getting sick could be as simple as chance.</p>

        <p>What? Your response makes absolutely no sense. The employees who didn't get sick are there all day long. Customers obviously did get sick, who knows if they were there for 15 minutes or longer. The ones that didn't get sick were the ones there the longest and wearing N95 masks. So I am puzzled exactly what point you're making.</p>

        <p>I don't think anecdotes are enough to say one way or the other. My spouse's restaurant had to shut down when an employee tested positive and was very mildly symptomatic when they came to work (before being tested, they didn't come to work knowing they had it.). Everyone working there was wearing masks, they wore one, and no one got a positive test as a result of exposure to them at work.</p>
<p>However, they spent a few hours after that shift talking to another off-the-clock employee, both sans mask, seated next to each other at the bar, and...still no positive test. So I don't think it's that cut and dry to say the masks stopped the spread in this case. It just didn't spread for whatever reason.</p>

        <p>A coworker had covid back in April at my job before we had a mask policy.  None of the other 100 people (or myself) got it.  Thoughts?</p>

        <p>I'd need more information for a better understanding. How big is the office, are you all in close proximity, is it an open office or does everyone have their own space, are you all talking a lot, are you guys eating together, what's the air circulation like, how sick was your coworker, did that coworker spend a lot of time with everyone else, did everyone get tested and test negative - as some other comments here have mentioned, other people could have gotten sick and been asymptomatic etc.  </p>
<p>It's a lot of extra situational stuff but, given that scientists and researchers who spend all their time trying to understand this virus still have a murky grasp on this, I think it's fair to say that there are a lot of factors that affect how people get sick and pass on the virus</p>
