    <strong>"Expect to wear your mask for years" -Mike DeWine says Ohioans will wear masks for awhile, after new study finds just 1.5% of state had coronavirus antibodies in July</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/10/just-15-of-ohioans-133000-had-antibodies-to-coronavirus-in-july-statewide-study.html">https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/10/just-15-of-ohioans-133000-had-antibodies-to-coronavirus-in-july-statewide-study.html</a></p>
<p>"DeWine later commented on the study, concluded that it shows Ohio isn’t anywhere close to herd immunity, which will occur when most of the population is immune to COVID-19.</p>
<p>That means Ohioans will have to wear masks, socially distance and exercise other preventative measures for quite a while."</p>
<p>My friend was trying to console me yesterday about how things are getting better, so the mandates/curfews should let up soon. Now I am fantasizing even more about moving.</p>
<p>Ohio isn't even as bad as some other states in regards to the lockdowns, and yet I still feel like a goldfish that went from a pond into a 1 gallon bowl. I can't stand this.</p></p>

        <p>Pretty much, yeah.  So DeWine says we have to mask until there's a vaccine because only <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/10/just-15-of-ohioans-133000-had-antibodies-to-coronavirus-in-july-statewide-study.html">1.5% of of the people had immunity of the 727 tested in July</a>.  We don't have freaking immunity because of masks, mandates, and not being able to gather socially under normal conditions.</p>
<p>I can't freaking stand DeWine.</p>

        <p>Its actually using bad science too. A really significant paper found out months ago that the blood antibody tests used for all these studies do not pick up the most mild / asymptomatic cases. The IgA antibody found in mucous membranes show way more people who've had covid than blood tests do.</p>

        <p>Yes the idea that % ABs translates to % immune is straight up dumb. I’m actually surprised Dewine is this stupid. </p>
<p>Does anyone have a link to the actual study they did to get this data?  What test were they using?</p>

        <p>It took a while for me to find anything about this study, but the <a href="https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/overview">Ohio coronavirus dashboard</a> led me to this pdf link on the study called <a href="https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/static/dashboards/prevalence-covid19-ohioadults.pdf">"prevalence of past and current covid-19 in Ohio adults"</a>. It's not the actual study, just a summary of the data.  I haven't been able to find the actual study yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whio.com/news/local/state-coronavirus-antibody-study-findings-contradict-some-earlier-research-professor-says/TCRI6BXJI5HVXCNJC6SWSNOV3I/">Ohio's Lt. Governor John Husted said that his takeaway from the study is that we need to reach herd immunity and that a vaccine will be needed</a> for this to end.  My problem with that statement is this: how can we reach "herd immunity" when we must wear masks everywhere, can't have normal social gatherings, large group gatherings such as outdoor concerts and fairs have been cancelled, and so on.  I understand the risks associated with those types of gatherings, but they're also how herd immunity is reached: by living day to day life without unnatural isolation. The low number of Ohioans with antibodies per the study tells me that the population largely conformed to the health director's mandates.  It also tells me that the majority of people are still susceptible due to their adherence to the mandates and therefore not naturally developing antibodies.</p>

        <p>Ya they don’t say which AB test they were using but their study design is totally flawed. </p>
<p>Their study sampling relied on volunteers from representative geographic areas, not on population centers. Thus there is a very clear over-representation of Northwest Ohio which is mostly rural except for Toledo. We know the virus prevalence is much higher in big cities, where most of the population lives- places like Cleveland, Columbus, and Cinci. </p>
<p>Because they relied on volunteers to give blood, the participants are more likely to include the “worried well”, aka people who aren’t even exposed to the virus and have not had it yet. </p>
<p>This is evidenced by the fact that most of the study participants were women and 90% were white. Only 5% were black and 2.9% were latino. </p>
<p>Furthermore the group they studied, 85% of participants said they were only leaving their homes for essential errands. </p>
<p>So if you wanted to know the prevalence of white women in the suburbs who aren’t leaving the house, this study is great! 👍</p>

        <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yet this is what DeWine and his interim health director (who is an attorney, not a doctor btw) are using as justification for further mandates.  It astounds me that so many people don't question these measures even when they cite flawed studies like this one as the reason for it.  </p>
<p>It's truly mind boggling how easily people fall in line to even the most asinine logic put forth by authority figures.</p>

        <p>Sounds like my family.  My daughter thinks she had it in February, and it's not at all like her to ever admit she's sick.  My stepdad thinks he had it, was sick for about a month, but his doctor wouldn't test him because he said the tests were unreliable at that time. About that time I was really sick too with godawful headaches and feeling no energy "blah." I did chelated zinc, vitamins C &amp; D, oil of oregano, and some elderberry syrup. I stocked my daughter up with those too but I don't know if she ever took them.  Probably not, she never uses my herbal remedies.</p>

        <p>I have no doubt less people would have died.  How many nursing home patients died because covid patients were put there.  How many people at the beginning of shutdown were day drinking way too much and eating fast food because that was the only take out option - those sure aren't good for immunity building or good health.  So many people didn't go for regular medical visits, elective surgeries, or dental visits in the first few months which couldn't have been good for health. And the common sense thing of going outside for fresh air and exercise weren't really done.  And of course blocking off people from each other to prevent immunity building.  It's like the "protective measures" were designed to cause more problems and deaths.</p>

        <p>Flu season approaching is why I’ve been using less hand sanitizer after going places. I used to always pump a bit into my hand from a bottle in my car after the store or pharmacy or anywhere really. Now I’m letting my immune system have at it especially since I’m being strict with vitamins &amp; keeping myself healthy with that plus diet. I don’t want to have survived the last 6 shitty months just to have H3N2 take me out.</p>

        <p>No kidding.  Do you remember years ago they told us not to regularly use hand sanitizers because it weakens immunity (among other reasons not to use it.)  Then covid and it's liquid gold.  Then it's poison again and on the recall list because of shoddy ingredients.  I can't even keep up anymore. You're wise to do what you're doing.  Yeah, it would totally suck to be taken down by the flu after the hell this year has been.  Stay well!!</p>

        <p>Same to you! I usually get something that becomes a sinus infection or bronchitis every winter or a 3-4 day flu but this year I don’t need anyone on my shit thinking it’s covid so I’ll hope my immune system does the job with me supporting it with a non-trash diet and vitamin D, C &amp; Zinc. I’ve never had a problem getting sick but I don’t want to have to get a covid test to prove its one of the OG illnesses as usual. This is all so fucking annoying.</p>

        <p>Yeah I was considering moving to TX but with all the massive influx of pro mask, pro lockdown, far left types moving there I gave it a hard pass. Sad because I grew up half there and half in my home state and have an affinity for it, but that Texas is long gone. It's going to be the next California in less than 10 years. Austin has already fell, and now they are flooding San Antonio, DFW, Houston etc. It's over for TX.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s much more complex than most think. Long story short: CA libs tend to head to states like OR, but conservatives tend to head to TX, unless it’s Austin</p>

        <p>Yeah I've seen that but that's not what I see with my own eyes. I had liberals flood my conservative area. Yeah you get one of two conservative transplants but you also get 5 liberals as well. The net sum is less and less conservatives and more blue. That's what happened to us. And now that is spreading rapidly through other parts of the state.</p>

        <p>That’s odd. I follow and study elections and it appears that it is a pretty consistent pattern that people moving in from out of state tend to skew R, unless it’s Austin like I said. And there’s more, a 2013 UT Tyler survey done among Californians turned Texans across the state found that 57% leaned to the right, vs 30% which leaned to the left. It appears we will have to agree to disagree.</p>

        <p>Masks aren't that effective either as long people aren't as trained as medical professionals and use them wrong. In addition they affects deaf, people with auditory processing disorder or autism negativity. Some are depended on lip reading. Let's not forget mental health, claustrophobia, anxiety, difficulty recognizing people etc. It affects people's abilities to social interactions.</p>

        <p>I like living in Ohio most of the time.  Just because DeWine sucks ass shouldn't deter you.  I doubt he'll be around after he's up for re-election.</p>
<p>That election will be a trip.  I see SO many posts on FB and other social media from democrats who say something like "I'm a democrat but DeWine is doing a great job and I would vote for him."  So I'm guessing many democrats will vote for him, and many republicans will not.  DeWine will probably join his predecessor Kasich as a public "republican" tool of the democratic party.</p>
