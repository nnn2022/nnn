    <strong>I miss when local city subs were more than just political/doomer echo chambers</strong>
    <p><p>Remember those days?</p>
<p>Those subs were always a great way to find out what was happening around town, learn some fact you'd never heard before, or maybe see some cool photography. Now? Toxic garbage, and I've had to unsubscribe from just about all of them.</p>
<p>If it weren't for subs like this one and super niche-specific hobby subs, I'd probably ditch the site altogether.</p></p>

        <p>There are very few subs I'll even consider visiting anymore, this being one of them.</p>
<p>A story: My wife and I planned an outing to a local brewery last year. Before we left the house, I found out the local beer subreddit was having an impromptu meet up at the place we were going to. I mentioned it to her in passing and said we can join them if we want. I told her no, I don't want to drink with reddit people. She was slightly taken aback, as she met a large group of her friends from a reddit meet up before we met.</p>
<p>Knowing how fucked up the local subs tend to be, I just wanted to steer clear. When we got there, there was a section of a table marked off for the meet up. There were about 10 people, only a couple talking to each other and the rest on their phones or silently staring into space. They looked exactly how you think they did. I dodged a bullet.</p>
<p>As much as I like to hear about stupid memes related to the Austin sub, I don't miss the idiots who populate it.</p>

        <p>It sucks that most of the social / happy hour meetups (meetup.com) I see are all virtual even though where I am right now there’s no restriction preventing gatherings of under 200 people. The few that do are insane about covid stuff.</p>

        <p>YES. Not everything needs to devolve into a tribal conflict where we just throw rocks at each other. I'd rather find common ground on similar interests rather than using similar interests to make people pick a side. People are so eager to see one another as enemies.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. Take any niche hobby, say, archery. You have a white male Republican and a black female Democrat, both of whom happen to be passionate about archery. Aren't they more likely to find common ground and friendship when they bond over their shared love of the sport, rather than, as you said, forcing two people with something in common to pick a side?</p>

        <p>There are certain types of people who ruin everything they touch, the Internet being no exception. It's just that before the 2000s and especially 2010s these people had relatively little influence. Outside the top few truly big websites, though, it's not nearly as bad.</p>

        <p>It’s just a chance for people with the puritanical/authoritarian bent to finally get their hey-day on a forum where they don’t have any push back. Currently a lot of people are pushing back IRL and telling these busybodies to get bent and mind their own fucking business but online they can basically be up their own asses and high on power tripping with impunity. </p>
<p>The day of reckoning is coming. I know a fair amount of people for whom the vaccine is end game no matter its effectiveness. They’ve told me as such. They realize that nothing beyond that is coming to save them and a vaccine will mean ditching this pseudo-existence. I know a lot of people here don’t believe that but I see it everywhere. A lot of people know that whether or not the virus is eliminated doesn’t matter. A vaccine is all there is left for getting this shit over and done with and we will otherwise have to live with whatever cases arise even with a vaccine. I can’t wait for these doomers to once again have no ground to stand on.</p>

        <p>I think you're right. Social media tends to amplify the most regressive antisocial lunatics alive.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I wonder if this is why some of the doomer subs seem to be doubling down so much lately. I wonder if a lot of the more moderate people on some of those subs have started going back to their normal lives and the true Branch Covidian believers are the only ones who remain.</p>
<p>&rt;The day of reckoning is coming. I know a fair amount of people for whom the vaccine is end game no matter its effectiveness. They’ve told me as such.</p>
<p>It seems like it's either this, the election, or even January 1 for a lot of people. It's all arbitrary (just like everything else with this damn pandemic), but people are starting to draw their lines where they're ready to say "enough is enough." Every Nashville case story, San Francisco gym story, and hypocritical government official pushes them a little farther, too.</p>
<p>It seems like the tone of the COVID Karen complaints seem to be changing, too. It's less, "Why are those people acting recklessly?" and more, "Why are those terrible people having <em>fun</em>?!"</p>
<p>Same with the people pushing lockdowns. It's not, "I feel safer at home." It's, "I'm so glad I don't have to talk to people in person anymore because of my social anxiety." The real motivations are starting to seep through.</p>

        <p>The narrative, while shitty, has changed somewhat in recent months. The reason you don't hear flatten the curve anymore is the same reason you don't hear "they just want a haircut" anymore. It got very tiring and wore itself out.</p>

        <p>My local city sub was annoying before but it was a kind of annoying that was amusing and I had fun making fun of it in the city circlejerk sub. Now the sub is a mixture doomer shit, stupid questions from people who forgot how to do basic daily tasks “during a pandemic” and the circlejerk sub is the same rehashed jokes and memes about “covidiots.”</p>
<p>Yeah got tired of it. Get off the local city sub and go out into public and you realize the city sub is a bunch of people sitting inside panicking while life moves on outside without them.</p>
<p>A lot of other subs I once enjoyed are just cesspools of alarmist drama. Even a snark page about a shitty reality show I used as a diversion has a few posts a day about someone on the show out and nOT WeArInG a MaSK.</p>

        <p>I got an app called Friendly and filter out a ton of key words on Facebook. Seeing everyone’s opinions (and giving in to the temptation to share my own) was only making me resent my Facebook friends and changing my opinions of some for the worst (and probably others of me as well). Best thing I ever did was filter out the noise and made a hard rule to 1) not make any more posts airing my personal opinions about what’s going on in the world and 2) not get into any Facebook arguments in the comments of anyone else’s posts. It’s never been worth it.</p>

        <p>I left Facebook, but actually went <em>on</em> to Twitter for the first time. I use it totally differently though. I am anonymous, don't follow anyone I know, and use it mainly to follow independent journalists doing interesting work (initially Alex Berenson). Even then it's somewhat addictive and toxic, but it's been helpful for the moment.</p>

        <p>Albuquerque is so bad. They're constantly brigading businesses, trying to get local companies shut down for not doing everything exactly right according to Doomer standards. Everything is anti maskers fault, even though we've had a mask mandate since May, including outdoor exercise. Our bars are still closed, no sports allowed, no school in session, nothing. Then our governor does weekly condescending preaching sessions blaming these closures on us, because we're not doing enough to social distance. Most of our state is rural FFS. I hate everything about this, and my city sub are so far up on their high horses I don't know how any of them can breathe</p>

        <p>I loved reading my city sub prior to late February. It was entertaining and quirky just like my town is during normal times. Now it is all doomer posts, complaining about people not wearing masks, and taking pictures of gatherings in town or people at the beach and shaming them.

        <p>Agreed. I'm actually starting to wonder if we'll get to a point where social media is grouped into the same category as porn sites. Yeah, it'll be legal, but there's going to be some kind of disclaimer like, "Are you over 18 and choosing to view this intentionally?" People will still visit the sites, but these sites won't have the same "friendly" connotations they once had. I think we're well past the point of social media being about friendships and communication.</p>

        <p>I keep hearing people blaming the masses on social media for causing all this, but it's not as if there was some massive popular upsurge driven by online organizing that compelled politicians and bureaucrats to push lockdowns and fearmongering propaganda. This has all been caused by a tiny group of elites acting more or less independently of any opinion on the Internet; if you'll recall the fashionable parts of the Internet in February were mocking as xenophobic any concern about COVID-19 and were primarily concerned talking about it would stigmatize Chinese people. They only became hardcore pro-lockdown when the elites told them to be.</p>

        <p>As a car enthusiast, I frequently would visit Jalopnik and r/cars to read up on cool cars and cool stories. These are as far from politics and Covid as you can get, but it still manages to slip in. Jalopnik especially. Nowadays, I visit car-specific subs or small internet fourms to get my fix. r/E30 , R3VLimited and Bimmerforums comes to mind. </p>
<p>I'd also hit up r/orlando to see what's happening in the city, but now it's an anti-Ron DeSantis rally filled with doomers.</p>

        <p>They've calmed down a bit but I remember back in March/April a lot of people preaching that you shouldn't drive for non-essential reasons, chastising people who posted pictures from cruises, posting pictures of cars in the garage with captions like "I miss driving", etc.</p>

        <p>I've been back a handful of times and you're right. It's mostly normal from what I saw.  Still can't get over the fact that they said you could give Covid to someone by stopping at a station to put gas into your car.  They even recommended wiping down the pumps and wearing gloves.
