<p>I guess u can label me a "Relativist" based on the article, however I got a news flash for the author and their's 'theories' about how to get people to better comply with 'health mandates' - it doesn't matter how you 'frame the message,' there are those of us who can SEE THE TRUTH behind what you're doing and we will NOT comply!</p>

        <p>I agree with the basis of the study, that there are moral arguments to both sides and that different personalities will have different moral outlooks. But I can't help but laugh at Forsyth's hypotheses.</p>
<p>He does a good job of defining his terms in his introduction:</p>
<p>&rt; [Ethics position] theory traces differences in moral judgments to differences in people's concern for others' well-being (idealism) and compliance with moral standards (relativism). Those who are more idealistic are attentive to the welfare of others, whereas those who are more relativistic are skeptical about universal moral standards. These two dimensions parallel the philosophical distinctions between moral theories based on the consequences of actions (consequentialism) and those based on principles and duty (deontology).</p>
<p>Okay so far. I disagree with the parallel to consequentialism and deontology, but that's irrelevant for this study (I'm really not sure why he included that sentence).</p>
<p>&rt; Applied to noncompliance with health mandates, ethics position theory suggests that idealism will limit noncompliance, but that relativism will elevate it. Idealism is associated with concern for others and more negative evaluations of actions that may cause harm. When, for example, individuals respond to moral dilemmas, idealism predicts more positive evaluations of prosocial choices (e.g., McNair et al., 2019). Relativism, however, is associated with a skepticism of, and often noncompliance with, standards that define the difference between right and wrong. Relativism predicts leniency in judgments of moral indiscretions as well as an increased tendency to act in ways that are inconsistent with conventional moral standards (e.g., Tooke &amp; Ickes, 1988). </p>
<p>I argue with this paragraph on the grounds that individualists and relativists could go either way. This sub is a prime example of the idealism they describe here, but so are a lot of our critics. All of us are, at least in our own minds, concerned for others' well-being; the difference is how we approach it. We argue that the lockdown does more harm than good; our critics argue the opposite. All of us want the most people to have the best outcome. Our existence already disputes half of their theory, as our flavor of idealism does not correlate with compliance.</p>
<p>It makes sense at first glance to propose that relativism is correlated with noncompliance; after all, relativists are skeptical of moral standards. On the other hand, consider many of our selfish-leaning critics, the ones mocked here and r/LockdownCriticism, who want the lockdown to go on forever because they're extreme introverts who love having an excuse to stay locked inside and to wear a face blanket when they're forced out. These are people who are loving the compliance, not because of concern for others' wellbeing, but rather because they love being able to disregard our old moral standards.</p>
<hr>
<p>The paper proposes two hypotheses:</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Hypothesis 1</strong>
&rt;
&rt; Noncompliance with health mandates for limiting the spread of COVID-19 will be associated with individual differences in moral positions, such that (a) idealism will be associated with compliance, (b) relativism will be associated with noncompliance, and (c) low idealism paired with elevated relativism will be associated with the highest level of noncompliance.
&rt;
&rt;<strong>Hypothesis 2</strong>
&rt;
&rt;Moral judgments will mediate the relationship between ethics positions and noncompliance, such that those who consider noncompliance to be morally reprehensible will be more compliant, whereas those who consider noncompliance to be morally allowable will be less compliant.</p>
<p>Based on my argument above, Hypothesis 1 should be trivial to dispute.</p>
<p>That said, <em>I actually agree with Hypothesis 2</em>. If we assume that everyone will give in to peer pressure (and peer pressure is a strong force!), then I believe it is a sound argument that people in general will do whatever most people are doing. </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt; in a survey of 303 US residents recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk)</p>
<p>This has to be the most hilarious line of the entire study. Let's break this down for a minute.</p>
<p>&rt; in a survey</p>
<p>Any scientist will tell you that a survey is the <em>worst</em> way to do a study. Self-reporting is just <em>asking</em> for bias. How many people did you <em>ask</em> to fill out the survey? Maybe all you've demonstrated is that <em>among the types of people who would fill out your stupid survey</em>, your hypothesis happens to line up. What about people like us who would laugh at you as we slam the door in your face?</p>
<p>&rt;of 303</p>
<ol>
<li>That's it. Not several thousand, not even one thousand. 303.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do I even <em>need</em> to explain the problem here?</p>
<p>&rt; US residents</p>
<p>Here Forsyth once again falls prey to selection bias, though of a different form. Maybe there's something about <em>Americans</em> that makes the difference between idealism and relativism so stark, even if we assume that one <em>can</em> draw a parallel between them?</p>
<p>&rt;recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk</p>
<p>Through <em>whose</em> program? Did you say <em>Amazon</em>?</p>
<p>Once again, we see selection bias in the study. Where are all of us who won't touch Big Tech with a ten-foot pole in this study?</p>
<hr>
<p>Let me preface this session by saying that I do not, at this moment in time, have access to the "Supplemental Materials" wherein Forsyth records his data. I have included my issues with this section below, and if and when I have access to the data, I will update this post.</p>
<p>&rt;The final sample ranged in age from 18 to 76 years (M = 39.67, SD = 13.01), with 38.9% (n = 118) identifying as women, 24.8% were African American, 2.8 were Asian American, 76.3% were white, 5.7% were Latino/Hispanic, 0.6% were Native Americans, and 1.3% were biracial.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">Simpson's Paradox</a>, wherein subgroups may have individual trends all in one direction while the overall trend is exactly the opposite as one example of the type of problem which may result. I'd be curious if he divides his data by race, age, gender, and sex, to see if there are any specific sociological factors that play into this (ex. poorer communities may be less inclined to comply, since they need to keep their stores open; a government-supported community may be more inclined to comply, out of fear that they'll lose their stipends). </p>
<p>Or even political ones! Plenty of studies (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886918301466">here's just one</a>) highlight correlations between political leanings and neuroticism (spoiler alert: the more educated you are, the more neuroticism is correlated with progressive politics). Maybe one's flavor of idealism or relativism is correlated with neuroticism, such that the higher one's neuroticism, the higher one's self-perceived lack of neuroticism and therefore the higher one will rank himself as an idealist (compare the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>).</p>
<p>Some of these points the author subtly addresses in his Results section and skims over. I'll address this more thoroughly later in this essay.</p>

        <p>&rt; Respondents also judged the morality of individuals who performed various behaviors that were not in compliance with the health initiatives, such as “does not follow the public health guidelines (they do not maintain social distance, they socialize regularly, they do not wear a face covering).”</p>
<p>I'm no psychologist, but I smell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)">priming</a>.</p>
<p>Priming is a phenomenon where certain stimuli are subconsciously picked up more quickly than others, thereby allowing researchers (or, more frequently, marketers) to skew data (or sales) by subtly biasing subjects without their explicit knowledge. This can take several forms, but the two that I spy here are sequence and language (my terms, not the official scientific ones).</p>
<p>Sequence, as I use it here, refers to priming by presenting one stimulus before presenting a second, thereby influencing one's view of the second. You're probably familiar with this from first impressions: if someone makes a poor first impression, he will need to do a lot more to convince you of his true virtue than if he made a better first impression. In this case, if we assume the questions were posed to the participants in the order presented in the Methods section, respondents were first asked about "how frequently they engaged in ten medically proscribed behaviors," <em>then</em> the EPQ, and <em>then</em> the morality of individuals who performed noncompliant behaviors. By priming the participants with the ethics questions, participants are subtly being encouraged to view these activities <em>through the lens through which they answered the EPQ</em>. Forsyth should've switched the last two categories if he wanted more reasonable answers.</p>
<p>Language, as I use it here, refers to the specific wording used for the questions. I assume that the quotations presented in the paragraph are taken from the survey. You can probably see the problem with framing questions as "How would you judge the morality of a person who does not follow the public health guidelines?," where the negative language primes the participants to rate them negatively.</p>
<p>As an aside, the questions don't explain <em>why</em> the person flouts the rules. The participants are asked to judge morality, not correctness. If the participants are of a school of thought that it's the deed that matters, not the reason or the ends, then fine; but one can't assume that. </p>
<p>–Oh, is <em>that</em> why he assumes in his introduction that there's a correlation between idealism/relativism and consequentialism/deontology? I guess by now it should be obvious what my problems with the parallel are, but I'll spell them out more explicitly anyway.</p>
<p>Suppose I'm a deontologist; it's the action that counts, not the consequence. I might argue that someone is immoral for not wearing a mask, because we have a duty to obey the government (idealism), or I might argue that someone is immoral for <em>not</em> wearing a mask because we have a social contract, regardless of whether said contract should be upheld (relativism). Conversely, suppose I'm a consequentialist; it's the consequence that counts, not the action. I might argue that someone is immoral for not wearing a mask, because he will make people sick (idealism), or that someone is immoral for wearing a mask, because he is promoting bad societal standards (relativism).</p>
<hr>
<p>Now for the fun part.</p>
<p>r^2 is a way of measuring correlation between data points, and it ranges from 0 to 1. The higher the R^2 value, the more closely correlated the values are.</p>
<p>What are his r^2 values?</p>
<p>The correlation between "age, educational level, gender, and race" with compliance was r^2 = 0.29. Pitiful. "Were all associated, to a degree, with compliance" — no, that's just a poor conclusion.</p>
<p>&rt; Younger individuals and those who had advanced further in their education reported acting in ways that increased their risk of contracting the coronavirus. Men reported more noncompliance than women.</p>
<p>No surprises there. Guess what? Kids and men tend to be more risk-taking than adults and women. That's not an issue of morality; that's an issue of hormones. And because we're talking about hormones, the data are probably even <em>higher</em> — he compiled his data according to <em>gender</em>, not <em>sex</em>!</p>
<p>&rt; Politics were significantly associated with noncompliance</p>
<p><em>Now</em> we're talking! He reports it as r = -0.26, which means r^2 is 0.68. While politics isn't a <em>predictive</em> measure of compliance, there does seem to be some correlation here. Maybe he ought to consider my argument earlier about neuroticism?</p>
<hr>
<p>Further in the section, he analyzes his two hypotheses. To nobody's surprise, he disproves two portions of Hypothesis 1, but maintains that he still has evidence for a correlation between relativism and noncompliance. I'm not convinced, but that <em>was</em> the one point that I had the weakest argument against.</p>
<p>&rt; Also, to test Hypothesis 1c, after centering all variables, we conducted moderated multiple regression analyses of compliance, with idealism, relativism, and their interaction as predictors. These analyses yielded no significant effects.</p>
<p>"Can we see the r-values and p-values?"</p>
<p>"No." -swiftly moves off-screen-</p>
<p>Really, though. Why <em>doesn't</em> he include the r- and p-values for this hypothesis, when he includes them for Hypotheses 1a and 1b? It's not like he has anything to lose; he's already admitted that that hypothesis was wrong.</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm not going to pretend to understand the statistics in his discussion of testing Hypothesis 2. Remember, this was the Hypothesis that I accepted as reasonable, that effectively states that people are susceptible to peer pressure.</p>
<p>He concludes that "The direct path coefficient between political orientation and noncompliance was not significant, but the political orientation to moral judgement path was." The first half of that we've already discussed above; the second half leads me to believe that, once again, neuroticism is the underlying factor here.</p>
<hr>
<p>The beginning of his discussion almost reads like something from r/NoNoNewNormal.</p>
<p>&rt; [E]ven though oddity is often in the eye of the beholder, the reaction of a substantial portion of the population to medical interventions designed to reduce the spread of a disease, if not odd, certainly seems exceptional.</p>
<p>Maybe you should consider how scientifically sound those interventions are, and whether that's actually the reason for which they were designed? Oddity truly is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>&rt; Individuals' moral judgments of noncompliance predicted who did and who did not engage in proscribed, health-compromising behavior.</p>
<p>Um...no? Didn't you <em>just</em> get through saying that you didn't find any significant relationship between moral judgement and compliance?</p>
<p>&rt; Those who morally condemned people who did not comply with health mandates (joining social gatherings, not wearing face coverings, and so on) were themselves more compliant; those who judged the noncompliant more positively were not.</p>
<p>I may be naïve, but I feel like most people (i.e. people who aren't politicians) try not to be hypocrites among their opinions, regardless of the coincidence of their opinions and fact.</p>
<p>&rt; They considered noncompliance to be as ethically acceptable as compliance. </p>
<p>This is just bad writing. I assume "they" refers to the second group, "those who judged the noncompliant more positively," but the antecedent isn't clear from a strict syntactical perspective.</p>
<p>&rt; People who express a heightened concern for protecting others from harm did not judge noncompliance favorably, and they were slightly more compliant, but the effect was not a strong one</p>
<p>Once again, sir, I invite you to join us on this sub. There's a very good reason that idealists may still be against masks.</p>
<hr>
<p>The good news is that he admits to many of these flaws!</p>
<p>&rt;[B]y no means was our sample a representative one. We used very different items to measure compliance behaviors, relativism and idealism, and moral judgments, but nonetheless common-method variance may account for some portion of the judgments-relativism-noncompliance relationships.</p>
<p>Maybe there's still hope for him yet.</p>
<p>&rt;These limitations aside, the findings confirm a configuration that has often proven elusive: a close connection between moral personality, moral reasoning (judgment), and morally evaluable actions.</p>
<p>Oh well. </p>
<p>By the way, "evaluable" is not a word. Did you perhaps mean "measurable"? Thesauri are really not that hard to come by when you have an Internet browser in front of you. Maybe he was using Internet Explorer.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt; Two rival explanations can account for the robust relationship between moral judgments and moral action. Individuals who considered noncompliance to be morally acceptable may have subsequently engaged in risky behaviors, but then again: after engaging in risky behaviors, individuals may have rationalized their actions as morally acceptable.</p>
<p>Or maybe there's a third option: you're just as neurotic as the other compliant sheep in your study.</p>
<p>&rt; Nonetheless, in identifying a personality characteristic that determines the strength of this judgment-behavior relation (relativism), this research meets a goal set by Blasi (1980) by identifying “the processes that fill the space between a concrete moral judgment and its corresponding action” (p. 42).</p>
<p>Neuroticism is also a basic personality characteristic, you know. Maybe you should check that out in your follow-up study? I'll bet you'll find an r^2 value greater than 0.29.</p>

        <p>&rt; The results may also prove useful in developing more successful health-promoting interventions. These interventions, such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) anti-COVID-19 advisories, provide logical arguments for compliance, underscore civic duty, and explain that precautions protect others from harm. The current findings suggest that such messages could be strengthened by framing prevention in moral terms: taking precautions is not just the healthy choice, but the morally commendable choice. That messaging, however, should be framed in such a way as to appeal to both high and low relativists. Whereas nonrelativists may be motivated by a message that stresses moral duty, those who are relativists will likely be influenced by messages that indicate compliance is not an indicator of the abrogation of the right of each individual to make their own moral choices.</p>

<p><em>AND PREVENTION!</em> Just because it's not in the acronym doesn't mean it's not important!</p>
<p>-cough- Sorry, just needed to get that out of my system.</p>
<p>&rt; provide logical arguments for compliance</p>
<p>No they don't.</p>
<p>&rt; underscore civic duty</p>
<p>I'm all for civic duty, but I have no intention of accepting fascism wrapped in civic duty. </p>

<p>Don't make me vomit.</p>

<p>I fail to see how compliance is anything <em>but</em> "the abrogation of the right of each individual to make [his] own moral choices."</p>

<p>In conclusion, this study is bunk, does not deserve to be published in any journal, and discourages my patronage of the journal <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em> and its publisher Elsevier (who, unfortunately, publishes basically every major scientific journal out there).</p>
<p>There's a lot of similarly fun articles to tear apart in the volume (which you can browse <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/personality-and-individual-differences/vol/175/suppl/C">here</a>). They have one on "factors influencing mental health among American youth in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic" – do you want to bet they blame it on teens playing more video games in lockdown? (Yes, I plan on ripping most of this volume to shreds when I'm bored enough.)</p>
