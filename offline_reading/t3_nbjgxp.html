    <strong>"We are all in this together"</strong>
    <p><p>If I am now responsible for other people's health, I have to do the following:</p>
<p>Your pantry and refrigerator needs to be inspected in case you have junk food.  The sodas are contributing to obesity and diabeetus.  They must be discarded, as covid is primarily affecting obese people.  This is for the collective good.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm gonna have to take those cigarettes away from you as well.  Your tobacco usage is going to put a strain on healthcare resources, as we will prioritize more towards this pandemic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What's that you're doing?  Oh, you're engaging in promiscuous sex.  Stop right there what you're doing.  You could be spreading around diseases in which you show no symptoms of, just like covid. <br>
 You could be spreading around this lethal disease, unless you wear at least 2 masks.  Don't object, it is common sense to cover your mouth.  So back to the relations issue, the only healthy option is abstinence.  Forget the porn, as it makes you objectify people.  So, no more of that.</p></p>

        <p>The CDC updated their average comorbibities for COVID deaths to 4.</p>
<p>Do you know how unhealthy you have to be to have FOUR comorbibities?</p>
<p>And four is the average, a good portion have even more.</p>

        <p>That's generally how it works with comorbidities. You start off with one, the most common being being overweight, and it leads to a whole bunch of other issues like high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea etc etc.  And the annoying thing is that during this whole lockdown, when they were telling healthy people to stay home, all I saw online was people talking about how they were packing on the quarantine pounds. It was no secret that being overweight made you higher risk but apparently no one wanted to do anything about that, better to just make everyone else stay home and shut down schools for the lowest risk group.</p>

        <p>Annoying doesn't even begin to describe it.</p>
<p>You never hear the CDC, WHO, FDA, or the NIH mention anything that would fortify ones immune system and/or general overall health </p>
<p>Excercise, eat properly, don't smoke, get sunlight and if you can't take vitD supplements (deficiency is more common that not in COVID deaths) maintain an ideal weight, moderate your alcohol intake. </p>
<p>Nope. Instead it's restrict your breathing with a cloth petridish, stay indoors, avoid the gym, and get your experimental gene therapy that didn't have proper animal trials and shortened human trials</p>

        <p>This relates to a previous point I have made </p>
<p>Instead of destroying the global economy with inept panicked overreaching policies and the US borrowing 4 Trillion dollars we should have spent a hundred billion supporting grandpa and grandpa to quarantine. </p>
<p>Everything and everyone else, business as usual.</p>
<p>If grandpa and grandma choose to get an experimental vaccine then it should be their choice.</p>
<p>Trying to mandate children 12 to 17 to get the jab when they they are 2x more likely to die via lighting strike than COVID is bat shit insane.</p>
<p>Getting an experimental vaccine if you are under 60 and perfectly healthy is just dumb</p>

        <p>Well getting a vaccine is easier than changing your diet and it nets the same feeling of accomplishment. Not saying the vaccine is better. Changing your diet is better than getting an experimental vaccine. </p>
<p>They’ve actually inferred that nicotine is protective against the virus. Guessing big tobacco might’ve had a hand in that statement as I vape and have gotten sick many times since the mask mandates hit the legal system. </p>
<p>Can’t argue for or against casual sex as I’m not invested in it. </p>
<p>Porn sucks simply because the male pornstars suck at sex. The entire objectifying women movement exists to stifle man’s sexual attraction to women when that’s the thing that more often than not determines whether or not a man tries to get to know a woman and subsequently leads to a relationship.</p>
