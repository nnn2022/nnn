    <strong>Election Frauds in the US &amp; my question</strong>
    <p><p>Hello my fellow nonewnormal battle companions from the US!<br>
I've watched a video online (epoch times germany) about the election fraud allegations that are going on.<br>
A large number of germans are somewhat obsessed by the idea that trump will save the earth when the truth comes out.<br>
I don't have an oppinion, since I despise the elite and I somehow can't imagine that he's the good guy (maybe controlled opponent) but I've been asking myself this lately cause it triggers hope:<br>
Didn't the democrats somehow forsee it, that Trump won't accept his defeat and would try to "drain the swamp" for the frauds that have been happening? </p>
<p>Like with the german servers, dominion etc whats going on. There's no way, they could've been so dumb and expect him not to pull charges against it, or are they simply just arrogant &amp; want him out of office or do they have further plans after this all comes out? What are your thoughts? Do you think the voters fraud is real or just kind of a distraction? <br>
(At this point excuse my english lol)</p></p>

        <p>First of all, Trump is not the worlds savior. He's part of them, anybody who tells you he's not is obviously lying and hasn't done research. Don't put your trust into politicians, all of them are puppets.</p>
<p>And second, The Democrats won't let Trump back in the WH, no matter how hard he tries to get back in.</p>

        <p>right, I agree with you on all.  I also stated that I despise the elite. Just wanted to know how y'all perceive that.</p>

        <p>US here. A lot of people here predicted that Trump would contest the election results if he lost.</p>

<p>Sorry, but this is far from reality. Maybe in your social bubble this may be the case (since you also read the freaking Epoch Times), but most Germans either don't care or laugh about it.</p>

        <p>Well? I asked a question. If you weren't triggert by the fact that I've watched a video about it (god forbid lol) you would have read that I am no trump supporter or anything. (and even if, this shouldn't bother you, get a life)Far from reality? Okay, then I must be surreal (take that as a compliment) that I've made my own experiences with that &amp; asked myself this neutral question and wanted opinions from US people how they see that matter. Did I harm you in any way by posting this? So why are you crying when you can't read and weren't even asked?</p>

        <p>yes that's what I know too. But what's your opinion on the frauds if you're willing to share? Do you think it's really trump who's blowing up fake news about the frauds to distract or do you think it's real? I don't see how this is logical, maybe to mobilise the masses and start republicans to riot before it comes to the truth? I'm really just curioouuus how you all have been dealing with that reality show!</p>
