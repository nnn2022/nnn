    <strong>Vaccine and Mask Mandates at Work</strong>
    <p><p>So my employeer just sent out an email thats been their strongest worded one yet basically saying either get the vaccine, wear a mask and social distance again, or potentially face getting fired. I'm beyond pissed off as they should have no right to coerce me into getting an experimental vaccine and it's quite frankly none of their damn business if I'm vaccinated or not. As for the mask part, I have asthma and bad allergies so wearing one in the office is definitely a no from me, especially since they're not even effective and have their own health issues related to them. </p>
<p>Also, considering I've already had Covid and have naturally acquired antibodies, there's absolutely no reason for me to get the vaccine or wear a mask if we actually "follow the science". I'm considering just telling them I can't do due to my own personal medical reasons that are confidential, or just ignoring the email and hoping nothing happens. Any advice or anyone else in this situation?</p></p>

        <p>Thanks but yeah the way I look at it is if they try to force me in the end it's really not a place I'll want to continue working at. I can't help but laugh in an ironic sort mind way when people joke about us complaining about attacks on "muh freedoms" because they truly have no idea what type of hell socialism and communism will be if these people get their way in the end.</p>

        <p>Exactly, I have no problem with vaccines in general but I do have a problem when they force an experimental vaccine down your throat that is the very first MRNA vaccine in history. I have no issues with other people taking it, but I do have a major issue with them trying to force me to take it.</p>

        <p>May I ask what religion? I'm not religious but willing to become anything to avoid the you-know-what. I'm in PA and atm it looks like going amish is the best way to go but I'm open to suggestions. I am NOT a troll!!! Just check my previous comments if in doubt. Thank you.</p>

        <p>Omg. ALL standard poodles are service dogs in the respect that they make anything at home enjoyable. You're lucky. 2 is a great age! At 2 they are only just over coat change (which sucks!) and growing into their bodies and brains. By 3, they have you all figured out and your life becomes enhanced in every way! I envy you. Mine are 14, 11, 11, 11, nearly 9 and nearly 9. Everything is perfect now but I fear bad times are coming. Enjoy your apricot's youth!</p>

        <p>That's where you weigh in the pros and cons. Also understand the economy's current volatility and incredibly high prices of homes. Those two combined makes for a bad time to make such an investment. Though dont take my word on it, talk to a financial advisor. </p>
<p>We're on two different planes, I can say FU to the world, sell my house and move my family to a much simpler life. It sounds like you're just starting. Whichever path you decide, I wish you the best. Once you go that path, don't look back at what it would be like if you took the other option - make the best of that decision and continue to improve yourself every day of your life.</p>

        <p>Well, no matter how good your job is, you always need an escape plan. Start saving up money, reduce your costs or reliance on "the system" as much as you can. Make networks. Get experience. Research into other industries or cheaper places to live. You always need to be ready to move on short notice. </p>
<p>My employer is sending out daily emails every day basically just repeating government propaganda - make sure you're vaccinated, in vaccines we trust, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Vaccine. I have little doubt that they'll eventually start asking for our medical records to check if we've been jabbed. Personally, I can't wait to not give it to them. I love my job and the company generally does right by me but I'll happily tell them shove their corporate dystopia up their ass. </p>
<p>I've already made it clear to my direct managers that I'm not getting vaccinated and that I'm not afraid of a virus with a 99% survival rate. They're still in shock but they haven't had the gall to challenge me yet. I can't wait for them to try. </p>
<p>I think it will only take 1 lawsuit for this to be settled tbh. Employers don't have a right to your medical records. It's a matter of privacy. Firing people for not getting jabbed amounts to discrimination, just like firing someone for having diabetes or refusing to get chemotherapy for their cancer diagnosis.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear you're in a similar situation but good for you I honestly wish more people out there stood up for what the believe in and what is morally right. I'm not trying to make a scene or anything and trying to stay under the radar if possible, but I definitely will fight if it comes down to it. I'm going to update my resume and keep an eye on the job market in my area for starters, but I just hope it doesn't end up coming to that since I really like the people I work with for the most part. I'm with you though I don't understand how people can't fathom the idea I'm not terrified of a virus with a survival rate of like 99.995% for my age group, especially considering I've already had the dumb thing earlier this year.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that, I'm absolutely furious that the military is going woke and going along with this BS. Hopefully you don't loose your job here, but good for you standing your ground. These corrupt politicians  have pushed and pushed for years about everything and it's time everyone stands up and pushes back finally.</p>

        <p>My hubby is government/military. When I found out, the first thing I did is order a bunch of fake masks. Look on Amazon. The fake masks look real but in no way impede breathing.</p>

        <p>So my work requires a mask if not vaccinated. I'm ok with it honestly as some of my coworkers and their family are more at risk. I understand that they barely work but there is still a chance that they will and I'm personally ok with that. As far as the vaccine, I will claim religious exemption if they try to inforce a mandatory policy and if they presist I will start a lawsuit over this. In no way will I allow someone to dictate to me that I have to take an experimental vaccine for a virus that has a 99% survival rate.</p>

        <p>Isn't this a violation of the hippa privacy act? I say this while also having been asked by my employer to sign a form that states either A- I've been vaccinated.  and can provide proof or B- I have not been vaccinated and agree to wear a mask, I'm planning to talk to our union, also have asthma</p>
