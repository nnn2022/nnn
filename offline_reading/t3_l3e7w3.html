    <strong>out of all the terrified pussies crying for universal masks.... how many do you think were already exposed to COVID, but didn't even notice because it's so mild and unremarkable?</strong>
    <p><p>personally, I have three separate instances in the past year where I believe it's possible I could've been infected based on my symptoms, but I just don't know, because it doesn't matter and I never cared to get tested. Anyone else?</p></p>

        <p>Lots of them.  Also the ones who say "I hope you get covid and die" also refuse to recognize its no more than the sniffles for most people.</p>

        <p>Had a cold two weeks ago, was the weakest cold I ever remember. My gf just tested positive... typical cold for her plus loss of taste. I didn’t get tested but HAVE to now.. so stupid. The tests aren’t accurate anyway, even if it’s positive it’s not a guarantee, and even if it’s negative they say that doesn’t mean you don’t have it.. so there is literally zero point in getting tested.</p>

        <p>yeah. Well, if you want to expose yourself to the risk of possibly being quarantined, that's a good reason to take a test. But otherwise, yeah, no real reason why it would matter if you took one. I had someone test COVID positive in my house a while ago, but I still refused a test. I got phone calls afterward from motherfuckers trying to contact trace me, but I just ignored the calls. Why do you say that you have to take one?</p>

        <p>Employer forcing me and have to quarantine until I get a test regardless. So if I don’t test I’m quarantined, so my only hope of not quarantining is to get a negative test result.</p>

        <p>funny how different our situations are. When my wife's dad tested positive in my house, I could've hidden it from my job, but I intentionally told them and just took a two-week vacation by choice without even getting myself tested. They tried to tell me afterward that I wasn't allowed to come back unless I was cleared by a doctor. I basically told them, look, doctors cost money, you can either let me back now, or I'll just keep staying home until you're convinced I'm okay. They let me back immediately, and as you can see I'm still laughing about it</p>

        <p>I think I had it a few months ago. I hung out with a close friend of mine a few times and then she said her husband tested positive and she probably had it too. I had a couple days of sniffles, maybe a tiny fever one day, whatever. I refuse to get tested, I was/am fine. I should also say my mom (64!!!!) joined us (maskless at a coffee shop!!!!) one of those days. She was fine, was never worried. We refuse to live in fear. </p>
<p>For all the sob stories about people who got hit with it sooooooo bad I imagine if Covid was never reported in the media it would just be considered a bad flu season....like every other year of our fucking lives.</p>

        <p>A lot more than they realize, probably.</p>
<p>I also believe that psychology plays a huge role in why so many younger doomers who test positive claim to have super serious symptoms. (Obviously, lying plays a big role too, but in the cases where they're telling the truth...).  They hype up the virus so much in their heads, convince themselves that it's going to be a death sentence, etc.  Then they get a positive test, and they psych themselves out.  Their minds and bodies go haywire; through some sort of cocktail of psychosomatic symptoms and overactive imagination they spiral into this self-fulfilling prophecy of horrible horrible symptoms and "long COVID".  Most of what these people describe as "long COVID" is literally anxiety attacks and depression.  I assume that most young, relatively healthy people who had "bad COVID" or "long COVID" would have fared much better, had milder symptoms and recovered more quickly if they had simply never seen that positive test result.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is moot because they're still convinced you can get COVID multiple times, so they won't give a shit if they already had it.</p>

        <p>In my opinion the "so mild you don't notice it" or "a mild cold" is NOT covid 19. Covid 19 is the bad flu that makes you feel unwell. The reason they say "most people don't have symptoms and most people get a mild infection" is because they don't have covid - they have a positive PCR test result.</p>

        <p>that's a view I'm still entertaining myself. I'm trying to analyze what I'm seeing, but I don't consider myself to have enough data to make a definitive ruling one way or the other. I've seen a whole lot of positive cases though; I work at a nursing home and they've been testing regularly for a while now. Most of the time the symptoms are extremely mild, or they can't even be distinguished from having no symptoms at all. The residents legit don't even care.</p>

        <p>See if you can find out the cycle rate. If it's above 30, they're probably all false positives if they have no symptoms.</p>

        <p>I think the most interesting data may present itself shortly, within a matter of days, when our most recent round of test results come back. Just this past week we had something in the range of 20 positive cases in the building, more than we've ever had since we started testing. Under ordinary circumstances I would only expect this to worsen, perhaps exponentially, just due to the high contagion and the failure to really contain it. But practically none of these guys even had symptoms, and I'm anticipating that the method of testing is about to change, dramatically reducing the chances of a false positive. What that means is, either way, the result should be extreme, and I won't miss it.</p>
<p>I just hope I don't go back to work on Monday and find any more of these guys in the hospital or worse. I can joke about COVID all day, and it's legit funny, but I love my residents, and I definitely don't want them to get sick for real.</p>

        <p>The thing which makes me think it's all just false positives is because, while I've heard about people getting diseases worse and less badly than others, I've never heard of a disease that ranges from flu symptoms to no symptoms and still be called the same disease. But yes, like you say: time will tell.</p>

        <p>If I’m being 100 I believe it’s like the walking dead. We all already have/had it. There is no avoiding it. Double triple masking isn’t going to change the months of exposure we all had prior to testing being available.</p>

        <p>that's funny. I watched some Walking Dead way back, I gave up after a few seasons. I remember the detail that everyone has the zombie virus or whatever it was, that it's just dormant in the entire population. I've thought of it a few times and considered making COVID jokes about it since then, but I felt like it was too obscure so I just never whipped it out. But yeah, I totally feel you</p>

        <p>Had an acquaintance very fearful since the start. He refused to eat out or get out. He finally went back to work and still hasn't gone out to eat etc. He ended up donating blood and they said he ahs covid antibodies (?) in his blood. So we're guessing he's already had it? </p>
<p>He did mention that for one day he lost his sense of taste but blew it off. He also had a lot of side affects from his first dose of the vaccine.</p>

        <p>when I think "pussy", I don't even think of vagina any more. To me, the term is completely independent and has taken on a life of its own. Essentially, there are two different words called "pussy", which are homonyms. One of the words describes a vagina, and the other describes a soft, weak person, but aside from their spelling and their pronunciation, they are unrelated.</p>

        <p>I have covid and it sucks. I got it from my family members. I am not hospitalized but I got it worse than many. My 10 year old sister also tested positive and isn't doing well. I just thank God that my sister and I are generally healthy and have no underlying conditions that could mean our bodies would not be able to fight off covid-19 effectively. For some people covid is mild, and good for them. For others it is more serious or even deadly.
We need to listen to what the scientists who have done decades of research on viruses and how they work and what we should do about them have to say.  That way when this is all over, we can go hug ALL our loved ones without fear of anyone catching a virus or putting anyone at risk.</p>

        <p>the fear won't end until the people promoting the fear decide it will end. They don't care about your health, or my health, so our health will not be the thing that decides it. It will stop when they say it stops, or it will stop when people stop listening. The scientists will not tell you accurately when it stops, and they will not tell you accurately what to do. They will tell you what they are allowed to tell you, when they are allowed to tell you, and that's it.</p>
<p>I'm sorry you're sick, and I'm sorry your sister is sick. I don't want either one of you to be sick. If you want to avoid symptoms like these in the future, there are a few easy things you can do to reduce the likelihood you will experience the symptoms. The scientists won't tell you these things, but I will. They're very straightforward.</p>
<p>for one, you can stop practicing the thought patterns that correspond to psychogenic illness. Psychogenic illness is a real phenomenon. It isn't triggered by any physiological cause; it's triggered exclusively by thought patterns. Nevertheless, it translates to real, measurable symptoms in reality, which can be extremely debilitating. Because the condition occurs as a result of thought patterns, it only makes sense that different thought patterns would result in a different condition.</p>
<p>two, you can stop believing in such a way that renders you vulnerable to a placebo effect. Placebo effect, again, is a very real, very well-understood phenomenon, and it translates to real, measurable symptoms in reality. The placebo effect is caused directly by belief, or directly by expectation. Therefore, it would only follow that, in order for you to change the effects, there should also be a corresponding change in your belief, or a change in your expectations.</p>
<p>finally, third, you can work toward general psychological competence, and remove unnecessary stressors from your life -- such stressors as, for example, an irrational fear of germs, or a disproportionate preoccupation with death. General stress is known to have detrimental, often severe physiological effects on the body that are very well documented, including increasing the body's vulnerability to infections, causing infections to become more severe. Therefore, to reduce the effects of future infections, it only makes sense that you would reduce such stressors as these.</p>
<p>cheers and good luck.</p>
