    <strong>Masks protect us</strong>
    <p><p>They protect us from social rejection and ostracism. The science hasn’t changed that masks are ineffective in providing protection from this joke of a virus, but the political agenda has become obvious. Mask mandates might make some people <em>feel</em> safer, despite evidence that masks are useless, but they also condition us to be okay with the state abusing liberties and stripping away rights via emergency measures and tyranny.  I cringe anytime I hear “new normal.” I don’t want to settle into a new normal with all these meaningless rules and restrictions, normalizing obedient behavior, rewarding conformity and submission. It is absurd to even entertain the idea that people should alter how they live their lives because a virus that has been utterly blown out of proportion by the media. Meanwhile there’s the greatest transfer of wealth in history into the hands of the 1% and subjugation of the working class and small business owners. It’s no wonder politicians are incentivized to spread this narrative because their lives aren’t the ones affected by this “pandemic”, they profit because they receive a sufficient budget. As long as we are conforming to these mandates and policies, the more government will take that as consent, and they will keep us under control to consolidate and validate their bureaucratic power.</p></p>
