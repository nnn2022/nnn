    <strong>Is the real killer virus coming soon?</strong>
    <p><p>Bill Gates and Co. will release a virus that‚Äôs similar to Covid-19 and everyone that‚Äôs vaccinated, when they come into contact with it, will have their mRNA genetically engineered immune systems hyper-react to it and kill them. That‚Äôs what will make their population reduction a reality.</p></p>

        <p>i‚Äôve recently been wondering this;</p>
<p>why kill off the people loyal that will do whatever you say?</p>
<p>why not kill off the people who won‚Äôt?</p>
<p>why do we think they‚Äôre the main target and we‚Äôre not?</p>

        <p>The farmer is a sweet guy and couldn't possibly ever harvest the chickens.</p>
<p>We're more like the crows or squirrels sneaking in and eating the chicken's feed.  They would want to be rid of us and cull some of their herd, if it came to that.  Georgia guidestones said 500,000,000 people total world wide.  Numbers gotta come out of the obedient, too.</p>

        <p><strong>‚ÄúIn a speech to the World Economic Forum at Davos Switzerland, England‚Äôs Prince Philip,</strong> then President of the World Wildlife Fund International, <strong>told an elite gathering</strong> of the world‚Äôs most influential business and political leaders that <strong>the human population must be treated like so many sheep that must be ‚Äúculled‚Äù to desired size:</strong></p>
<p><em>You cannot keep a bigger flock of sheep than you are capable of feeding. In other words, conservation may involve culling in order to keep a balance between the relative numbers in each species within any particular habitat. I realize that it is a very touchy subject, but the fact remains that mankind is part of the living world and the apparently unending growth of the world‚Äôs human population can only end in a crisis for all life on earth.</em> ^15 </p>
<p>Prince Philip omitted to say who would carry the awesome responsibility to decide on behalf of the entire human species who got culled and who was allowed to survive.  He clearly had an unspoken idea who. </p>
<p>A definite pattern was evident in all the Rockefeller-backed NGOs using the their supposed environmental concerns and the alleged ‚Äòenergy crisis‚Äô as their theme in the early 1970s. They were used to instrumentalize an agenda of resource control ‚Äî calling it ‚Äòconservation‚Äô ‚Äî especially of energy.  ‚ÄòConservation,‚Äô in turn, was to be used to demand reduction of overall living standards‚Äîausterity. </p>
<p>In addition, the cover of ‚Äòstabilizlation‚Äô was to be used to advance the negative eugenics agenda of the wealthy and powerful backers of population control. And no family was more prominent in that area in 1972 than the Rockefeller family. In 1972, the year of the Earth Day conference, John D.  Rockefeller III, founder of the Population Council, issued a report to President Nixon as head of ‚ÄòThe Rockefeller Commission on Population Growth.‚Äô  Rockefeller‚Äôs report concluded on an eerie and ominous note: </p>
<p><em>After two years of concentrated effort, we have concluded that, in the long run, no substantial benefits will result from further growth of the Nation‚Äôs population, rather, that the gradual stabilization of our population through voluntary means would contribute significantly to the Nation‚Äôs ability to solve its problems.  We have looked for, and have not found, any convincing economic argument for continued population growth. The health of our country does not depend on it, nor does the vitality of business, nor the welfare of the average person. By its very nature, population is a continuing concern and should receive continuing attention.  Later generations, and later commissions, will be able to see the right path into the future.  In any case, no generation needs to know the ultimate goal or the final means, only the direction in which they will be found.</em> ^16 </p>

        <p>Because they don't give a shit who's loyal and who isn't, Bill Gates, Rockefellers and the other powers that be are in such a powerful position that it literally does not matter to them, or so they think. The goal is mass depopulation, it matters not who dies only that they do. </p>

        <p>This is such a crazy situation but I've been hearing this a lot too, from a lot of these doctors who've been deplatformed and they explain it, I can't explain it myself I can't remember the terminology they use but they're basically saying this. That the vaccine is going to cause a massive reaction in people's bodies within the next couple of years and a lot of them will die. Who knows if it's true or not but it's not something you really want to hear. They've even been saying that people will die and it won't be connected to the vaccine, it will be from seemingly unrelated things like organ failure Etc.</p>
<p>I think the next lockdown is going to be related to this climate bullshit. They are going to start suffocating Us in propaganda and use it to control us just like they have with a virus. We are going to be bombarded with it 24/7. The same people who have been wearing their masks and screaming at us that we are selfish losers are going to be yelling at us for eating burgers and going on vacation. That's what's coming next.</p>

        <p>The reason they will kill all the lemmings first is because this is the Aquarian Age, the Age of mass deception. Luciferians deal in deceit as a medium of exchange, both with the normie as well as with themselves. Betrayal is practiced as a value system within that belief system. This is why no Luciferians really trust the other one. That is why they have to compromise each other through recorded despicable acts, because without an external mechanism to counter the inherently dishonest nature of the whole practice, they could never work together. They rejoice in the demise of others due to their clever deceptions and lies. </p>
<p>For instance, Satanists will find a single mother with a baby, invite her and the child over for "dinner", take the child from the mother upon arrival to be watched by a "nanny" while the adults have dinner, and then proceed to serve the child to the mother and the other guests as some extravagant meat dish. As the meal finishes, they will then tell the mother what they have just done and rejoice in her instant brokenness and pain. Then they kill the mother and eat her.</p>
<p>This is the mentality behind the killing of the lemmings. Deception is their greatest virtue. After all, they serve the Father of Lies.</p>
