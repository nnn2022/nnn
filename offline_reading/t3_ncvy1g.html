    <strong>Nova Scotia: May 15th rally organizers cancel event due to supreme Court injunction.</strong>
    <p><p>There was supposed to be a rally in Halifax this afternoon.</p>
<p>Yesterday it was announced that there is a supreme Court injunction against the organizers that authorizes the police to enforce public health measures in regards to organizing a rally AND posting anti vaccine and anti mask "misinformation" on Facebook. Very vague.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/province-gets-injunction-to-block-planned-anti-mask-rally-1.6026894">CBC article here</a></p>
<p>The organizers have cucked, and I can't say I blame them. The vitriol I've read on every social media post since we had a similar rally here two weeks ago, and no fines are handed out. Popular opinion seems to be that you should be jailed or killed for being so "selfish". Our fucking premier said that anti lockdown rallies are "alt-right"</p>
<p>Ironically, these same people are defending the BLM rally that took place last June on our busiest Street downtown, with well over 1500 in attendance. They claim that that's different, because everyone at that event was social distancing. <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/Uvw47zzg1wRYouUE9">I'll let you be the judge of that</a></p>
<p>For context, the last rally and this one were both planned for Citadel hill. A very wide open public space not even close to a busy pedestrian thoroughfare. <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/JQZq8YgoSmS4AbL86">This is a picture of the scarce crowd in attendance</a></p>
<p>You have to be out of your mind to say that one is fine, but the other is not.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia has officially fallen. Canada is fucking done.</p>
<p>I'm ashamed and embarrassed to be a Canadian.</p></p>

        <p>You can stay for up to 6 months visa-free, and then apply for sanctuary. Or just overstay, at which point you become “undocumented.” Depends how you feel about breaking the law in order to escape tyranny.</p>

        <p>I saw a post about it on a Bedford group on Facebook. The comments were straight Gestapo. I don't know if these folks get that once they give up the right to protest, it isn't just for the thing you hate, it's for everything the government doesn't want you to protest.</p>
<p>They were claiming, in the post, that the "Police are helping them". Meaning, protestors applied for a protest permit from the police and got one. After a few hours, the group admin turned off commenting for the post.</p>
<p>I admin a few groups on Facebook (collecting hobby) and they are very clear about closing groups down that allow "anti-covid" talk. So, I think the admin may be wary of realistic comments. Despite the group comments on the post, only maybe 1/10 folks wear a mask outdoors.</p>

        <p>It might actually have been wise if they had low numbers. Police in the hard lockdown regions are starting to outright brutalize people. There is no political solution over there</p>
