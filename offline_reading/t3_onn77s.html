    <strong>Got vaccinated from the U.S Army.</strong>
    <p><p>Okay, so during my time in OSUT, training as an infantryman, I had the opportunity to get the vaccine. I decided to do it considering how the world is changing around its involvement. Then I regained my freedom after I've graduated and I start to read differnt post on this page about its criticisms and negatives, I personally havent experienced the side effects other than feeling somewhat sick a few days afterwards. I sometimes feel like I've given in, to what many others are fighting against. Did I morally make the wrong decision? Much of the army consists of fairy healthly and fit individuals who are very durable and it doesn't really phase them. Though it's not like the army forced me to do it. At the time I had a choice. Have I made my life more prone to being unhealthy, have I doomed my descendants with mental disorders and slight deformities? I know that sounds drastic, though what should I honestly believe considering the controversy around it?</p></p>

        <p>In my personal view, a morally wrong choice would have been researching everything, deciding you don’t want it, then taking it anyway out of peer or family pressure (which isn’t true for you). I don’t think everyone can be blamed squarely for not knowing beforehand given the amount of lies and propaganda surrounding it - especially as vaccines in general have become normalised - but I would like to think the majority of healthy adults would look into the risks first. It’s good that you’re questioning it now but as others have said, it’s impossible to know how it’ll affect individuals until a few years have passed.</p>

        <p>Personally I'm not really aloud to have an opinion on the issue, but I cant help but think I've made the wrong decision for the long term future. The propaganda around being scrutinized for not getting the vaccine is unreal and inhumane. Not sure if there is something nefarious in it they want people to be injected with, or it does nothing really at all and they simply want to profit from the use of the vaccines themselves. I think partial ignorance is to play in my decision, before I joined I was very much against the idea of the vaccine at its current level. Then I found they ended up changing it to something fairly average but effective. Though I didnt know much considering my lack of access for information outside of training. I think I just forgot who I used to be before I joined, not sure if that's a bad thing or a good thing. I want to come to terms that getting the vaccine was the right thing to do for myself, though if others dont feel the same that's their independent right. In a way they also blackmailed us, they told us if we didnt get the vaccines we wouldnt be able to see our families after graduation.</p>

        <p>We don't get to fail upwards, so when we make a mistake we feel regret.  This is a time not to dwell but to reflect and learn and integrate as you move forward.  Any mistake you make can be catastrophic, this one isn't yet.  You have not gained knowledge, you have become wiser.</p>

        <p>Even better if you speak up against medical apartheid as a vaccinated person. They think it's only the unvaccinated that see the issues. Show them it's not true. Be our voice.</p>
