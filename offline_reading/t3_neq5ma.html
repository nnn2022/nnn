    <strong>The Wokest Link</strong>
    <p><p>It's just one big fucking aggressive circle-jerk of a game show to see who's the most woke and virtuous in other subreddits, isn't it? THE WOKEST LINK.</p>
<p>First Platinum Award prize and a butt-load of Reddit karma goes to the person who "cares" the most! Full vaccination-status is of course required for entry, and be sure to impress the internet judges and audience with a sob story about how "my gran was put on a ventilator for two weeks straight and I wasn't even allowed to see her but that's okay because it was to keep her safe!"</p>
<p>As you bask in the glow of your shiny Wholesome Award and wipe the pre-cum from your throbbing little chublet, someone with a masked and winking Reddit avatar replies:</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, I know THREE PEOPLE that have died from Covid, and that's not even including my chonker cat Mittens who died of a heart attack during first lockdown but we're pretty sure she had Covid, too! GET VAXXED PEOPLE!"</p>
<p>Oof, that's a tough blow to your ego and the upvotes are fucking flooding into the grief-thief's comment! Misery poker, eh? Well, two can play at that game, mate! You type back furiously, slurping down a can of Mountain Dew:</p>
<p>"I'm SO SORRY to hear about your loss! I forgot to fucking say actually that me and my wife and her muscular best friend who she spends an inordinate and suspicious amount of time with have all caught Covid even though we're all fully vaccinated, wear three masks and stay at home twenty four fucking seven! I'm REALLY poorly right now!"</p>
<p>Ha! That'll fucking fuck the fucker! You sit back smugly in your la-z-boy recliner, arms folded neatly across your pillowy gut as your inbox is bombarded with messages of concern and well-wishers. An avalanche of awards stack atop your comment; you edit in a little Oscar speech below it that would make Sally Field blush. "THEY LIKE ME, THEY REALLY LIKE ME!" you think to yourself, on the edge of creaming your khakis.</p>
<p>Just as you think you've got him beat and you go to log off for the night, a reply from Mittens' bereaved owner stops you mid-click:</p>
<p>"This is u/LasagnaLover34's husband. My wife sadly passed away unexpectedly at her computer an hour ago. She was an avid Redditor and I know she'd want you all to know what happened to her! My wife was midway through composing a post to the CovidVaccinated subreddit when she passed and her head hit the keyboard. I will post it below unedited as a tribute to her:</p>
<p>I (f34) just had my second shot of Moderna and apart from a hankering for Microsoft products and a sore arm I have no symptoms to report. I'm also getting 5g signals nd mikrochipp lol but i'm sure tht wil pass anydbsajbdsna bcnsbc</p>
<p>Do not let my wife's completely unrelated death deter you from doing what's right. Please get vaccinated, people."</p>
<p>Short of dying, you have lost to the female Jon Arbuckle wannabe. The virtue-signalling is too strong; not even a thousand dancing nurses performing to the autistic Fauci kid's rendition of Mr. Sandman could beat it. You swiftly close the laptop lid and sulk behind your masks, knowing full-well that all that sweet, sweet Reddit karma and internet adulation is being given to someone else. You resolve to try again tomorrow, and pray that the pandemic never ends.</p></p>
