    <strong>I was paranoid at the beginning of everything last year, but now I doubt everything that I see.</strong>
    <p><p>Hand sanitizer, masks, isolation... I fell for a lot of stuff at the beginning of this all. I was worried for my family, as well as myself. I let life get in between me and everything that I held dear. I thought that this might really be something big, and that it was time to prepare for the inevitable. I thought that people in my life might actually die from this virus that spreading throughout the world like wildfire. Well here I am... 1 year later and 1 year wiser. Nothing is what they said it would be, everything is chock full of lies. What happened? How did the entire world and our lives really get turned upside down? We just let this happen like it was nothing, and so many people still accept it to this day. This is just the beginning. If you really thought the rest of your life would be simple, well you were wrong. They won’t let it be that way. It’s going to be up to us to stand tall, or else everyone and our entire future will be doomed to fall. Be strong everyone, we are in this together. People are starting to wake up. It’s our time.</p></p>

        <p>Ummmm...big...it's a corona virus. The common cold is a corona virus.Thought maybe it's more dangerous for old people at the beginning but asymptomatic transmission is largely bullshit and rare for respiratory viruses. Never disinfected,never distanced,worked in person,went on holiday,didn't wear a mask or worn incorectly if l absolutely had to,never been tested for the bullshit and l'm STILL HERE. No one l know died.My boyfriend's parents in their 60s haven't got anything from either of us because we didn't have it because we had no symptoms when we went to visit them.</p>
<p>Never bought into this hoax and l can't believe what's going on for the past year and a half. I think l died sometime in March 2020 and what l'm experiencing now is a glitch in the matrix.Otherwise l can't rationalize this.</p>

        <p>In the beginning I was also scared. We didn’t knew anything about corona then and I guess it’s okay. They showed us people die in china, they feed us their lies. Then it was hard to argue since we didn’t seen how false it was. Disgusting manipullation what goes on and on. I don’t see any people collapse in the middle of streets. I don’t see full hospitals, full crematoriums. Corona ended beign something like flu. I don’t know how people can still belive in all this lies when now they can see it themselfs</p>

        <p>I was scared for a few weeks. Then I had an honest conversation with myself. If the only thing standing between me and sudden death was whether or not I sanitized the gas pump, then we were all doomed and it was only a matter of time before we all perished. I accepted my fate. I am a Christian so I was not scared of dying. Once I let go, it became a lot easier to see just how overblown this all was.</p>

        <p>Exactly. When you’re a moral person with no fear of God’s judgment, you lose your fear of death. When it seems like you won’t be free to live, you start to question your reasons for existence on this plane... Then everything else becomes a basic risk assessment.</p>
