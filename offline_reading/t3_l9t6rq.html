    <strong>Vaccine distribution in your state</strong>
    <p><p>I live in PA.  The vaccine distribution here has come under fire bc the governor has essential workers (not healthcare workers, they were number one priority) meaning teachers, grocery store workers, second tier healthcare workers, postal workers, public transportation workers, persons over 65 and etc receiving the vaccine in the next round. But previously 65 and over were NOT in this phase and it was only essential workers.  Then because of how Florida and a few other states did their distribution the CDC changed the recommendation to have 65 and over be in the next group.  My state then changed their distribution to include that population. Well this obviously created a major shortage in supply and now people are complaining that essential workers who are young and not at risk should NOT bc getting the vaccine before 65 and over.<br>
But others are making the argument that in order for society to move on, those who do the bulk of the work need to be protected and the 65 and older can self isolate and social distance a few months so we can get society moving. </p>
<p>I’m torn on this.  I have a friend who is a teacher and she is in her 30s and she is scheduled for the vaccine before her own parents are and they are  70, do I think she should get the vaccine before the elderly population, no.  But do I also think that society can’t move forward without these groups of people getting it before the elderly, yes.   </p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>It really is that simple.  A good diet and some vitamins , fresh air, exercise, good night sleep, lots of water... same goes for any other illnesses.  Most people have poor diets, stay up all night arguing on the internet, stay indoors, don’t exercise, and wonder why they get sick - then expect some vaccine or medication to fix them.   I do understand that modern medicine has come along way, but you have to put in some of the work yourself.</p>

        <p>They said the V word !!1. Get them1!! But seriously here’s the way we’re doing it where I am and how I see it:
First in line were elderly and first responders.  According to policy makers this is because they are the most at risk and most exposed populations respectively.  In my opinion another reason is because we are the most expendable.  In both cases, taking the vaccine is something that is not only voluntary, but we had to go out of our way to sign up for.  And we are happy to do this because:
If the bad outweighs the good of the vaccine, we can pump the brakes on the roll out and go back to the drawing board.  Better us than our children/grand children than the general public- which I signed up to put my life on the line for anyway.  If it works fine - then great problem solved. 
  I go in for my second shot in two weeks - let y’all know how it goes.
There’s plenty of people in this sub that think all vaccines are bad or this vaccine is bad and that’s fine.   They probably never get the flu shot either and the world still turns.  But for everyone else who is trying to get this show on the road - good on yah.</p>
