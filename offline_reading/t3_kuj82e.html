    <strong>The next 'just wait until' milestone has arrived - and it takes us into 2022</strong>
    <p><p>I pay close attention to how the media covers the pandemic, as they set expectations for the general public on what the timeline is.</p>
<p>The media got in hard and early with the 'second wave' stuff, so people were prepared for a second lockdown this winter.</p>
<p>For months however, the timeline given has always been 'let's just get through this winter' - and even Fauci has been saying 'normal by fall'.</p>
<p>I have media alerts set for his comments, and 'Covid + normal', and in the past week there's been a noticeable increase in stories saying: "Even with mass vaccinations, we're looking at another spike and restrictions <em>next</em> winter".</p>
<p>Pay close attention to this. They're laying the groundwork for 2021 to be a repetition of 2020.</p>
<p>Months of lockdown and restrictions, an easing for a 3/4 months from late summer to fall, then lockdowns all over again.</p></p>

        <p>Yep.</p>
<p>People tend to be like, "How is it you can predict what their next move is so accurately!?"</p>
<p>I'm just like, "Uh...they basically heavily hint at it in all their articles, broadcasts, whatever". This isn't rocket science. They spell out their intentions quite blatantly at times, you just need to watch closely and also be open to the fact that these people are all working in conjunction with each other.</p>

        <p>I follow the headlines the way you do.  People who say ignore the MSM are just lying to themselves.  It's the headlines not the articles that are used to drive people of the cliff.  People have never read the articles.  They know this and it makes their job easier.  They only need to manipulate the headlines.  They can leave the facts in the body of the article knowing that nobody gets that far.</p>
<p>I started seeing the same stuff as you as early as the summer.  People need to either admit that they are okay with this or start doing something about it.</p>

        <p>The whole thing is telegraphed. It's like stage directions.</p>
<p>Articles saying 12 more months of this are in the minority and I'm only picking them up with deep searching, but the volume of those claims will ramp up over the next month or two. </p>
<p>In six months, there'll be an obscure report saying: Actually it could be a 2025 - a half-decade pandemic. And so on.</p>

        <p>I believe the West is entering an information war and Covid is the proxy. So of course they are hinting at 2025 because they know the pandemic and the restrictions won't end any time soon. The attack on the West's social cultural values and economic means won't rebound in such a short period of time, especially since this first stage of warfare has been already happening for almost a year (March 2020). They have to condition the masses that this change of culture will be likely for a long period of time so they release this information periodically. </p>
<p>China is closer than ever to emerge as the first super power. America is divided more than ever and in political turmoil. In summary we are witnessing a change of hands of power between the two super powers. Covid facilitated this means and will continue to decimate the West and any country labelled as Western. In my opinion this will be the rise of Eastern power and influence and that's why we see such praise on how China handled Covid 19. </p>
<p>To go back to normal after already witnessing such superfluous handling of policy related to lockdowns and overreaching draconian measures will probably take a few years to unravel. </p>
<p>Sorta derailing your original comment but this is my own prediction for the decade. I know I'm preaching to the choir here but it's not looking like it will be an easy decade for western countries.</p>

        <p>None of this "temporary" stuff means anything, they made it up so they can extend it as  much as they want. The 'temporary' part is just marketing jargon. Democracy! (*) some critical issues not put to a vote, current representatives assumed to be mandated to deal with unexpected issues without input from the electorate, some freedom limitations apply, some speech deemed illegal, all budget items sold together, some bribery required.

        <p>Is that constitutional ? I think not, but we don't have any way to fight against that. I'm in Quebec. I realized last summer that they were keeping the "emergency health situation" going on, even if we recorded only a few Covid cases a day in July. They should have ended that situation... there's clearly a loophole in that legislation. They should not be allowed to keep that going on for 1-2 (maybe more) years.</p>

        <p>I was actually feeling optimistic about our chances of getting out of lockdowns once the "right people" got into office (since there wouldn't be a need for them anymore, now that their goal was accomplished), but recent events in the US have really made me think that they are going to use those as an excuse to keep us in lockdown for another year.</p>
<p>"Well we <em>were</em> going to let you out but then a bunch of you tried to destroy the entire US government in a siege that lasted 6 weeks from December 2020 to January 2021 (note: claims that this attack lasted only 1 day are disputed).  Sorry lockdowns for another year so you can think about what you've done"</p>

<p>I feel like slamming my head into a wall every time I see this sentiment on here. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but I wish people could be a little more perceptive about what sort of monsters these people in power are. The "right people" being in office were always going to keep us in perpetual lockdown. It won't be for another year either, it'll likely be much longer than that. Maybe not one continuous lockdown, but do expect "rolling lockdowns" that get longer and stricter every time.</p>

        <p>Yeah you're right I was being naive.  I thought they would just go "rah rah JB saved us all, if you ever let another DT in office we'll punish you again with lockdowns" and that would be that, but I didn't think that these people would keep finding excuses like the recent ~~1 day~~ 6 month riot on Capital Hill in order to use that as a cudgel to take our rights away.</p>
