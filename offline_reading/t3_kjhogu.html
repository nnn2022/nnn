        <p>Don't drop standards because of the lockdown. If they failed, it is because they did not put in enough effort. Covid has been too often used as an excuse by the able bodied.</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>Sure the education system may be worse because of covid. Still that's no excuse for students to be lazy. Fighting through this lockdown is everybody's responsibility. Just because others are dropping standards and making life hard for you doesn't mean you should drop your own standards.</p>

        <p>I agree with both of you. The lowering of standards is and continues to be a huge problem.</p>
<p>On the other hand, schools and teachers are being held to such a low standard that we are getting exactly the results you would expect and this isn't really the fault of the children. Distance learning is only effective for those who have had decades of discipline and have fully "learned how to learn" which is a skill in itself.</p>

        <p>I'm seeing this with my niece's school (an all-girls charter school).</p>
<p>The schoolwork may as well be a formality. She passed to the next grade while missing over eighty percent of her work. How the hell do you tell a kid why it's important to do their work when they'll pass regardless? I honestly think she may have known she'd pass, but didn't tell us (her entire class passed, despite most stopped showing up entirely) until we figured it out.</p>
<p>She participates more now, but she doesn't have grades. Homework, projects, but they're not graded. She's doing it to hang out (so to speak) with her friends from class and her mom has gotten more strict about it. But there aren't any consequences if she fails because, well, she can't fail.</p>
<p>She was an excellent student when school was in-person. She no longer takes it seriously, but I don't blame her. If I knew I could get away with not doing my job and still get paid, I wouldn't do it either. Can't blame her for the same mindset.</p>

        <p>Have you seen what remote learning is like during this? Its a fucking joke. Its not about effort. Half the time the connection fails or it lags and the sound cuts out. Logins for the 4 portals we have to use suddenly stop working and one of us has to stop working ourselves and go fix it which eats up 15 minutes. Then when stuff is working the teacher isnt teaching. She reads off a page then tells the students to do it themselves and then has to monitor they are using the portal. </p>
<p>Its as far as you can get from a "learning" environment. </p>
<p>Its so bad we opted to put our daughters into a "pod" with 6 other families where you hire a private teacher to come to a house and teach the pod of kids.</p>

        <p>That's awesome, and how schools should be. It's great to be from a country that hasn't thought of outlawing homeschooling so the government can control people from an early age.</p>

<p>This is correct but the other problem is the state run education to begin with TBF.</p>

        <p>I had a few teachers that had that policy, that a 50 was the minimum score as long as you turned it in.  50 is still a failing grade, but it does prevent a student that bombs several assignments in good faith from tanking their grade too badly.</p>

        <p>Imo, the students in any school that has been forcing the crap that is "virtual learning" on them for all or most of the school year should be able to get held back a year once this is all over. No grades, good or bad, just repeat the year's lessons in person so they can actually master the material. I imagine similar things have been done for students who had a long term hospitalization. It's a lot better to graduate a year later than most to graduate unprepared. </p>
<p>That being said: this article is propaganda in favor of restricting teachers' ability to grade their students independently, using the rationale of "it hurts black and Latino students" as cover for getting rid of teachers. Expect a similar article soon in the same paper talking about the promise of AI in "objective" grading. Which will be total BS because AI has already shown itself to reproduce racist existing systems in even worse ways (there's a reason California voters chose recently to keep their shitty cash bail system when the alternative was using an algorithm to determine who can be released before trial). But that is what the big tech money is pushing for, and they're totally down to hijack the real struggles of black and brown people in order to do it.  See the work of Alison McDowell, a parent activist who's been warning us about this trend for years:</p>
