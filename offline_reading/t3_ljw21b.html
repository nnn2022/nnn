    <strong>You remember how everyone said that ‚Äúlockdowns helped the environment heal?‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs a load of bullshit.</strong>
    <p><p>Let me explain. I work in the outdoor recreation industry in Western North Carolina and am a member of a nationally recognized conservation group. I have my masters in Natural Resource management as well. </p>
<p>All that aside, I have noticed some trends since COVID that have set off a domino effect that is quickly destroying various untouched ecosystems within the mountains. </p>
<p>There has been a MASSIVE influx of people moving/ visiting the mountains since May of last year. Natural areas under various designations and especially rivers are seeing higher rates of human traffic than ever previously recorded. Hiking trails are becoming eroded beyond repair, many endangered plants are seeing their populations poached at record levels, places that were once thriving temperate forest ecosystems are being clear cut for new development, and our rivers especially are seeing significant impacts as well. </p>
<p>I do a lot of water pollutant monitoring in my free time, something I‚Äôm particularly passionate about. I sample sites on different river systems for primarily plastic pollution. These sites vary in their exposure to human traffic, but the different between 2019‚Äôs numbers and 2020‚Äôs numbers were astronomical. </p>
<p>In 2019, we sampled roughly 10,000 pieces of plastic that were removed during weekly trash pick ups. </p>
<p>In 2020, that spiked to over 40,000. We also picked up approximately 2,000 disposable masks out of rivers, which infuriates me more than anything. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm watching my home, the mountains and rivers I love being destroyed right in front of my eyes. Ironically, these idiots visiting the mountains in droves to ‚Äúsocial distance.‚Äù</p>
<p>Our economy is predominately tourist based, but before I get the ‚Äúmug tourism dollars‚Äù argument: let me point this out. </p>
<p>You cannot have an economy based on outdoor recreation when the environment everyone is recreating in is being destroyed. </p>
<p>So thanks to all the idiots who bought into this pandemic, I really appreciate you being so considerate enough to invade, in mass, where I live and have the audacity to tell me that the lockdowns are helping the environment as I‚Äôm watching 5 acres next to my property being clear cut to make way for a housing development. </p>
<p>Fuck all of you, seriously.</p></p>

        <p>As someone who booked a mountain weekend in Asheville, oops :(</p>
<p>Something else I‚Äôve noticed is how it‚Äôs now totally okay for people to sit in drive thrus letting their cars idle for 30 minutes at a time. It‚Äôs ok to use plastic silverware and disposable menus because MUH SURFACES. I was even made to keep the pen I used at a business because god forbid I use it and put it back.  Not to mention the littered masks everywhere. </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt wanna hear one peep from these soyboys about the environment ever again.</p>

        <p>I used to go running running near an ecological reserve. On a busy day I might see 10 people total during a 1 hour run. But back in May 2020, when they closed all the beaches and public parks, on the last run I have done since then I must have seen 300 people all along this relatively narrow 3-mile long trail along the reserve. Even if all of those people are not leaving trash around, just the presence of all of those people must be stressing out the wildlife in the reserve.</p>

        <p>The development is a symptom of the record low interest rates, asset prices have gone through the roof almost every where in the western world couple that with every one wanting to get out of city's it's no wonder place like that are being over run with development.</p>

        <p>We camp along Kern River in CA every summer, have been going for over 20 years. I have never seen so many people descend upon the campgrounds there as last summer. We witnessed multiple groups of people show up with all new camping gear, still in boxes. I have never seen so much trash left behind.</p>
<p>I spent the Sunday before we left picking up trash on the banks and it was heartbreaking. Gatorade/soda bottles, cig butts, beer cans. Me and my kids filled up 4 or 5 bags worth of garbage. It makes me sick to think of how much trash is actually in the river.</p>
<p>The county ended up shutting down most campgrounds along the river, so people ended up making the climb up Sherman pass to Sequoia and the same thing went on up top all summer. Campgrounds packed, dispersed sites packed, so much trash left behind. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve also hunted the forest up there since I was a kid. A lot of poaching goes on up there but this year I found remains of three deer left literally by the side of the road, blatantly poached. The one that got to me the most was a little button buck left in a trash bag right at a pull out, they cut the back straps out and left the rest of him.</p>

        <p>I said it last April. Disposable masks. Disposable single serve condiments from restaurants, and their disposable flatware, and the box/potentially also foil it's delivered in. I worked in restaurants so it was blatantly apparent to me that we were piling on the trash when we had been hearing about the impending doom from that kind of stuff for decades already. And that's just that one industry... I don't know what kinds of trash waste have skyrocketed in other industries I wouldn't think of because of this.</p>
