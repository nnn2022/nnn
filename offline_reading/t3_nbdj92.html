        <p>They def are. My roomate had it, tested positive, all the symptoms. We smoked a blunt together like 2 days before. A day or two after his test result I had all the symptoms, most notably gasping for air (a symptom I’ve never experienced in my life). </p>
<p>I swore up and down that I had the virus, there was just no way I couldn’t have especially with him testing positive. Went and got tested and was told they were so backed up that I should expect a 3 day wait for my results. They called me back that afternoon saying I came back negative.</p>

        <p>From your link:</p>
<p>&rt;When we began this work in March, no external quality assessments had yet been completed for COVID-19 PCR tests. So we reviewed 43 external quality assessments of PCR tests for other viruses similar to COVID-19, and found that half of these assessments produced false-positive rates between 0.8 and 4.0 percent, with a median value of 2.3 percent.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Since then, results have become available from a few external quality assessments of COVID-19 tests. These have false-positive rates ranging from under 0.4 to 0.7 percent.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Our third line of evidence is from real-world uses of COVID-19 PCR tests wherein positive results were checked with additional tests. In most of these, the false-positive rate was between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.</p>

        <p>\&rt;So, with a 1-percent infection rate in the test population, a false-positive rate of only 0.5 percent leads to nearly 40 percent of the positive results being wrong. And although the false-negative rate is 50 times higher than the false-positive rate, it is nevertheless much more likely (nearly 160 times more likely) that a positive result will be wrong than a negative result will be wrong.</p>

        <p>Based on the flu vax effectiveness being around 50% I seriously doubted that 95% claim.</p>
<p>I do however realize that what they can do is just say that it actually was 95% effective in the clinical environment they tested it against which was probably a single strain and then they can act surprised when it actually is nowhere near that in the field due to strain variability.  </p>
<p>It's a bizarre experience being a random dude and coming to these conclusions yet almost nobody in the media ever even mentions such things and the only hard science I took was astrophysics and statistics which isn't even actually science.</p>
<p>The media needs to be held accountable for this.</p>

<p>0.05^7 is such a small number, there is no reasonable mathematical explanation for an event like this- only the human explanation that the 95% figure is just a lie and being covered up by more crappy numbers fed to a population that has been intentionally deprived of a proper mathematical and scientific education.</p>
<p>Variants being distinct enough that the vaccine only effective against the strain(s) it was designed against is also hot nonsense.  That's harder to explain in few words, but check out Dr. Mike Yeadon's explanation if you care enough to get informed.

<p>Well sure if you limit the sample size to people who have been infected you can get to 100% breakthrough. Shouldn’t the sample size be the entire team and those around them?</p>
<p>When you introduce a control group it becomes 95%, as in the studies. That’s how effective research is done.</p>

        <p>There were zero cases among unvaccinated control in the sample size of the rest of the clubhouse.  If unvaccinated people got sick, is there any chance they wouldn't report it?  How many vaccinated people were there total?  Are these were the only vaccinated people on the team?  My napkin calculation is obviously extreme and I apologize for the lack of context,.  Vaccine effectiveness needs to be compared to the control population, and this sample at the very least shows INCREASED risk.  Most of the players were probably exposed last year and have lasting immunity anyways, there has been ZERO testing in people who were already exposed and have existing immune responses, and that's a giant problem since in October the WHO revealed that 10% of the world's population had likely been exposed and it may be 20% now.  (The estimated 1.2 million deaths at that time in 780M infections is 0.15% death rate btw).</p>
<p>According to the recently released 0.1% of cases coming from outdoor transmission and a 0.05% global infection fatality rate for people under 70 (Stanford's John Ioannidas), there's a 1 in 2 million chance to get Covid-19 outdoors and then die.  And this isn't a risk for one single event, it's the risk for an entire year of being outside.  For reference, the chance you get struck by lightning in a given year is 1 in 1.2 million.</p>
<p>There is a 0.01% chance of Covid-19 infection from surfaces, which equates to a 1/20 million chance of getting sick from a surface and dying.  If 2 billion people get sick, that's 100 global deaths.  You are more likely to find someone born with</p>
<p>Why on earth would anyone participate in literally the only experiment that has ever the chance of wiping out practically the entire global population if it goes poorly (and animal experiments went VERY poorly) to keep themselves from events that are less probable than being struck by lightning?</p>
<p>And given that nearly all reports of the experiment going poorly are being systematically censored and scrubbed by the oligarchs who openly opine for global depopulation, what is the rational, reasonable, data-driven decision?</p>
<p>The 0.05% under 70/ IFR (and 0.15% overall including over 70) is about the same as normal seasonal respiratory infections.  The flu averages about 0.1%, but there are good and bad flu seasons.  Just don't hang around sick people and stay home to recover if you get sick.  This isn't some magical new disease that's nothing like anything else that ever existed- it is wildly contagious (and seems to be engineered that way), but pathogens cannot be both very deadly and very contagious, as very deadly means the host doesn't survive to spread the pathogen.</p>

<p>I’m going to have to disagree with you there. Hundreds of thousands have not died from lightning in the past year. On top of that, I haven’t seen anything about “animal experiments.” What I do know is that after studying the data it’s been concluded that vaccines are safe. In fact, a dozen or two dozen cases of blood clotting led to a pause in one vaccine. That’s a large reaction for a small correlation. If there was something causing mass damage in the vaccines it seems it would be paused.</p>

        <p>Actually, I’m not so sure this is true. Let’s say taking the vaccine increased your risk of death when infected by x%, if the vaccine is 95% effective at preventing symptoms it is still a net win for even moderately sized x. In fact this is the thing that bothered me the most about the original Pfizer paper and the data coming out of Israel. Hospitalization and death rates given that you are infected with symptoms and have the vaccine seem significantly higher. In the case of the Pfizer paper they had 1 critical patient out of only 13ish infected in the vaccinated group, which was a bit weird, considering the control group wasn’t nearly that high (keep in mind the people in vaccine trials are generally pretty healthy). To be fair there are other reasons for the increased hospitalization and death rate, and I’m not claiming the vaccine is causing it, but just pointing out that there is more than one variable in play here. The safety conditions you are taking about are independent of covid and hence are more of a concern from a raw numbers game.</p>

        <p>Give an immediate hysteria about non-vaccinated people being a risk to everyone, there is immense pressure in a story like this to report non-vaccinated infections.</p>
<p>You attribute good motives to these people who have been caught lying and falsifying data many times this past year.  HCQ?  Safe and effective- but emergency authorization is illegal if safe, effective therapies exist.  Which is why the truth has to be hidden and the Lancet devised a hit piece with a crappy experiment designed to fail that was retracted for its terrible science.  They don't care, because we don't have the time to challenge them in court and they own the courts anyways.</p>
<p>There have been orders of magnitude more reported vaccine deaths than ever before.  And we are told crap like this: https://nypost.com/2021/02/14/ca-woman-gets-covid-vaccine-then-suddenly-dies-of-something-else/
https://kvoa.com/coronavirus-coverage/2021/02/08/new-york-man-dies-25-minutes-after-receiving-covid-19-vaccine/</p>
<p>And the story is: "The health commissioner says the man did not have an allergic reaction to the vaccine."</p>
<p>How can they immediately make a definite statement without investigation?  How can you die immediately after a medical intervention and the medical intervention is by default given total immunity from blame?</p>
<p>Dying OF and WITH Covid-19 are distinctly different.</p>
<p>Dying at age 86 "of Covid" with four pre-existing conditions (which is the median age of death in Canada) is very different from a healthy 25-year-old getting sick and dying.  Option 2 is the mark of a real pandemic and it just doesn't happen with regularity.  The lowest risk age group, 1-19 has 1/8,700th the risk of the highest-risk age group of over-85 that has an estimated 5.4% case fatality rate (different than IFR).  1/8,700th of 5.4% is not a number worthy of vaccinating children.</p>
<p>All deaths within a period surrounding a positive test or suspected death have been counted as Covid-19 fatalities.  The testing was completely rigged- US new cases dropped by 80% in the weeks following the change in cycle thresholds and diagnostic criteria, and estimates a year prior suggested 85-95% false positives with 40-45 PCR cycles instead of 25 cycles.  At 80% false positives, the total death number is suddenly sitting at a bad flu season.</p>
<p>And the "excess" deaths include medical malpractice for focusing only on Covid-19 (for example, I went to the ER last May with what I now know was Mononucleosis and a heart blockage and they derisively sent me home because I didn't have Covid) and from people not getting useful discretionary procedures or checkups or people dying from suicide or drug overdose.  There were more excess deaths from drug overdose last year than Covid-19 deaths in San Francisco. (Complete with an actual, truthful fact check!?!?!?!?!?!)
https://www.capradio.org/articles/2021/04/29/fact-check-did-san-francisco-have-twice-as-many-drug-overdose-deaths-as-covid-deaths-in-2020/</p>
<p>If you want to dance around with the Cabal's numbers to try and justify mass human experiments for something that is just not that deadly (0.15% global IFR and that includes the ridiculous diagnostic criteria and PCR tests), you can join any number of Reddit circlejerks.  You know the mainstream narrative, so challenge it and see if it holds water.</p>
<p>And remember, there have been fewer than 1,800 flu cases in the US after an average of around 40 million a year over the past decade.  There are usually around 175 pediatric flu deaths per flu season, this year there was 1.  Where did it go?  If social distancing and masking work for the flu, why has coronavirus spread to fill the void with almost exactly the same number of positive tests with exactly the same symptoms even with orders of magnitude more people being tested than ever before?</p>
<p>There are so many more questions to ask, and using their explanations of their limited data sets without full context is just going to give you confirmation of the LIE.</p>
<p>Means, motive, and opportunity.  It's quite simple.</p>
<p>At this point if you can't dig and find reality you're either a bot or you're a hopeless cult member, so so have a lovely day either way!</p>

        <p>Number needed to vaccinate: 256. </p>
<p>I.e. 256 people to receive a genetic vaccine to prevent one case of "covid19". A case. Not a death.
Meaning: 255 people exposed unnecessarily.</p>

        <p>finally, someone pointing out the difference between efficacy and effectiveness.</p>
<p>efficacy is, as far as my mathematical understanding goes,  the number of people infected in the control group (placebo)  minus the number of people infected in the vaccinated group divided by the number of people infected in the placebo group (correct me if I'm wrong).</p>
<p>This number is derived during later trials but before the vaccine is rolled out and it is carried out in a very controlled way and only addresses short term success. Ongoing studies over many years may show a drop in effectiveness, I.e. with the flu shots having 50% efficacy (still a high rate of success but nothing close to 95%).</p>
<p>I think this distortion undoes what great work well researched, transparent vaccines can do but the covid vaccine has been hijacked by both politics (divide and conquer) and corporations (profit at all costs)  and so the whole process has become a mess. No wonder there is so much distrust and division.</p>

        <p>Quite telling is the fact, that vaccine manufacturers do not seem to be trying to improve their product by raising the currently demonstratively pathetic effectiveness or eliminating the multiple adverse effects because they are going to sell their product anyway.</p>

        <p>what? I wasn't given the hep B vaccine in hopes I would get "less severe" hep B if exposed. Same with mumps, measles, tetanus etc.</p>
<p>They're all meant to stop you from getting sick period.</p>
<p>Sure in theory you can get infected, but the vaccine trained the immune system so well that you won't even notice you had it.</p>
<p>If you're getting symptoms from infection after you were vaccinated against that infection, I don't think it's a great vaccine.</p>

<p>vaccine</p>
<p>[vakˈsēn]</p>
<p>NOUN</p>
<p>a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases, prepared from the causative agent of a disease, its products, or a synthetic substitute, treated to act as an antigen without inducing the disease.</p>
<p>Kids do not receive Polio, Measles, or whooping cough vaccines so they get "milder" cases of those disease, they receive them because they INNOCULATE them from those diseases. Which has always been the point up until now.</p>

        <p>Do people still not understand the difference between testing positive and actually being ill with covid? Positive test doesn’t mean you have covid!</p>
<p>Testing positive merely means there are traces of the virus in your body. Those people most likely aren’t showing any symptoms and can’t spread anyway.</p>
<p>Of course you can test positive after being vaccinated. If you are exposed to the virus, it’ll get into your system. Vaccines prevent you from getting ill. Or so they say</p>

        <p>I think it’s probably more due to the fact that the diagnostic tests are very unreliable. Like, I don’t think we even have a relatively accurate number on how many people have gotten or died from covid.</p>

        <p>The vaccines cannot affect PCR results in any way because the fragments the test shows are present everywhere. You can't remove them by any means. As long as PCR is used positive tests will show up. The only way to stop positives is to stop the tests.</p>
