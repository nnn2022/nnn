    <strong>The virus and the vaccines â€“ my views</strong>
    <p><p>Â· <strong>There is a narrative from which dissent is now labelled â€˜misinformationâ€™ and routinely removed, creating a virtual â€˜Disappearedâ€™.</strong> Co-operation between governments, tech companies and other supporters of censorship has aimed to present it as this by the Stalinesque removal of all dissenting media. Beyond online media, opposition is prevented by what has effectively become a â€˜Rule of Oneâ€™. </p>
<p>Â· <strong>Infections have been distorted by the dubious PCR test which was used to inflate figures by including the vast majority of people who had no symptoms at all.</strong> You never here of asymptomatic rabies or even asymptomatic influenza!</p>
<p>Â· <strong>Deaths week by week over 2020 were at similar levels to any other year despite the media hysteria</strong> â€“ when did you last her of someone having ordinary â€˜flu? (Mild this year supposedly because of mask wearing â€“ whilst the similarly sized Covid-19 virus thrived). <strong>2020 was the worst year for the UK age-standardised mortality rate since the â€˜Great Plagueâ€™ of 2010 which nobody can remember.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>â€˜Death rate the highest for â€¦ 10 years!â€™</em></strong> <strong>Most people think it is the highest since 1666!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Number of deaths registered by week compared to the average between 2015 and 2019</strong></p>

<p>Â· <strong>Traditional vaccines have always had a range of unpleasant things in them â€“ cells from animals, foetal material, mercury, aluminium, Polyphenol-80. But, regardless of oneâ€™s view of traditional vaccines, everyone should be suspicious of the short-term tested range and especially of new techniques such as messenger RNA, the consequences of which are genuinely not known.</strong></p>
<p>Â· <strong>Big pharma has links to politicians in all countries; they are not protecting democratic institutions and often have direct financial gain from the rollout of unnecessary drugs.</strong></p>
<p>Â· <strong>The centralisation of information in vaccine â€˜passportsâ€™ is simply an element of control and risks integration with consumer behaviour and social credit scoring.</strong> That is not financial credit scoring; it monitors whether you are a good citizen or not. Think that is not coming? Did you see quasi-mandatory vaxing coming? </p>
<p>Â· <strong>Given that the â€˜rolloutâ€™ will never end</strong> (the third shot is already being planned for autumn and the UK government says updates will be necessary), <strong>there is the longer term prospect of different social groupings being administered different drugs â€“ possibly from a very early age now that children are being vaccinated as well.</strong></p></p>
