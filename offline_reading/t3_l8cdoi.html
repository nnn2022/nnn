    <strong>The Elites are Humiliating Us</strong>
    <p><p>At this point any cult follower following the Covid cult cannot be woken up. With the new more intrusive if you get what I mean Covid tests rolling out in China (and if you haven’t noticed by now authoritarian foreign governments are testing grounds for us), and now 2,3,4 masks being recommenced by THE SCIENCE (Forgive us please, THE SCIENCE for ever doubting you). This is just humiliation. If they were not looking to humiliate and actually were looking to protect they’d encourage hazmat suits (even though of course COOVID is a joke). This has gone on too far. Luckily I have hope for escaping this system, through ideas I heard about through the Greater Reset (Pro-freedom activists gathered together at the same time of the Great Reset conference and put together their own which talks about solutions to the Great Reset). </p>
<p>Anyway, this humiliation has gone on too far. BTW I talked to my brother who is forced to wear masks DURING his soccer games about what he thought, and his just a mask mentality seems to be faltering hard. It doesn’t give me any pleasure though it’s sad to see when I ask him what he’s going to do if they force him to wear two or three masks? Enough of following government tyranny, they can go swab themselves.</p></p>

        <p>Humiliation is the entire point.</p>
<p>Take away people's self-respect, and they will do, and tolerate, anything.</p>
<p>Half will cower like whipped dogs. The other half will eagerly join with the oppressors to gain their own little piece of personal power and gain.</p>
<p>This is all about creating a society of ignorant, pliable, powerless serfs - controlled by Globalists and their minions as they were once controlled by superstition, the sword, and a caste of corrupt clergy.</p>
<p>Welcome to Feudalism V2.0.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day We're going to be the minority because so many people are easily controlled. Its always been like this to some extent, just seems that the majority is falling for it easier now days. The average person from the 70s would probably be more skeptical about this whole situation. What changed? im not sure but social engineering has to be the cause. How else did we go from a multitude of generations that would defend our rights to the death, to wanting to have them taken away for safety in the last two?</p>

        <p>I agree with all, but particularly like your last sentence. The next time someone pisses me off, I am going to tell them to go swab themselves. :)</p>
