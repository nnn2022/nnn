        <p>All that signed the "Barrington Declaration"</p>
<p>But probably orders of magnitude more who are just too cucked. Scientists in general are fucking spineless, want to avoid confrontation etc</p>
<p>That's why rule by the experts is just rule by proxy from the oligarchs. The experts are super easily corruptible and coercible</p>

        <p>I've read an article about it. Do you know what one key point of the Barrington declaration is vaccination? And they're main point was to still practice measures, just not as strict. </p>
<p>But none of them said it's a hoax, none dissmised the dangeos of the virus like you do. And most importantly, they weren't censored. I googled it and the first article that came up was not in any way cencored pr anything. You filter what you want from the information available and fail to see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Also, you say scientists are spinless, i haven't met a single scientist, or haven't seen a simgle scientist, doctor, historian, cosmologist, that's not willing to explain things.</p>
<p>Also, if this is cencorcip just beacouse people don't talk about it, that what do you call what the admins from this sub do? The rule thave i have to wait 15 minutes to reply, that discourages debate. The fact that they REMOVE post that contradict them, what's that? That's not cencorcip?</p>

        <p>One of the 3 main epidemiologists who created and co-signed The Great Barrington declaration is the person who is depicted in the meme you're questioning. </p>
<p>He was recently censored on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MartinKulldorff/status/1376292359718248452</p>
<p>As you can see from his credentials to be speaking on the matter, he is a professor of Epidemiology at Harvard. I doubt Jack Dorsey or his "fact-checking" hacks at Twitter are even remotely as credentialed to be in any way censoring his words.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the people on this subreddit and who are "lockdown skeptics" believe in the Great Barrington Declaration above all else.</p>
<p>We know the virus isn't a "hoax" - that's just something ignorant trolls throw at us to discredit us as loonies, flat-earthers, Qanon or whatever other ad hominem attacks you like to throw at us instead of engaging in honest debate. </p>
<p>I've also replied to you in another comment an article written about the subject of scientists being actively censored and I look forward to you not reading it and yelling "trust the science" at me.</p>

        <p><strong>Climate of 'fear' prevents experts from questioning the handling of the pandemic</strong></p>
<p><em>A CLIMATE of fear is preventing experts from questioning the handling of the pandemic, with reputations smeared, jobs lost and even families threatened.</em></p>
<p>From: https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1415896/climate-fear-handling-pandemic-experts-jobs-lost-families-threats</p>
<p>(full article below)</p>
<p>&rt; Much abuse has come from within academic or professional circles, with one professor saying debate was becoming impossible because “we are not talking to each other properly. We are being thrown into confrontational positions.” Many leading experts have withdrawn from the debate after having reputations smeared, jobs lost and even families threatened raising questions about pandemic policy. This month alone has seen one leading medic, working to protect vulnerable children, forced to abandon a project to safeguard youngsters after their name was sullied when they questioned the government approach.</p>
<p>&rt; Another expert has been sidelined from a vital role on a government advisory group, while senior NHS staff have been threatened with disciplinary measures for questioning the government approach online or in the media.
Senior academics say they have feared losing vital funding, warned not to speak out with the threat of disciplinary action or deemed ‘outliers’ for their views on lockdown.</p>
<p>&rt; At least two scientists have been subjected to public abuse by scientific colleagues who disagreed with their academic view.
One critic posted a grotesque image superimposed on a professor after he disagreed with his view. Other posts by scientists have branded colleagues “charlatans” and “snake oil merchants”.</p>
<p>&rt; A prominent professor accused a fellow academic of “deliberately subverting public health” on a twitter post after disagreeing with her views on managing the pandemic.
In another case a government scientific advisor called a university boss to try to stop one of its professors from criticising government policy.</p>
<p>&rt; Retired Supreme Court Lord Sumption told a podcast this week that he was a reluctant figurehead for questioning lockdown - but felt obliged because of the way critics had been treated.
He said scientists and politicians had been: “subjected to an extraordinarily unpleasant campaign of personal abuse.” He added: “I know a lot of people that would prefer not to put their head above the parapet. From the very moment I started to make these points I began to get emails from politicians who agreed with what I had to say but that they themselves didn’t dare to speak out. That I think is a very serious state of affairs.” He added that he knew of one scientist whose family had also been targeted: “People ought to be entitled to voice their differences of opinion.”</p>
<p>&rt; Sir Desmond Swayne, Conservative MP for New Forest West said: "Because of the stance I have taken over my lockdown scepticism I have received a large amount of correspondence from very eminent scientists and clinicians disagreeing with the conclusions that SAGE and the chief medical officer have come to. What I find very worrying is that with few exceptions they say 'please keep my details confidential'. Clinicians say this to me. ITU doctors say to me they have been warned not to speak out regarding public policy. There is a caustic public discourse out there, especially in social media. People who question the current orthodoxy are given rough treatment. Nobody wants to put their name to anything."</p>
<p>&rt; Sir Graham Brady, Chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, said: "There has been much to learn about covid 19 and what responses to it are more effective and which are more damaging than the virus itself. As we learn more it is essential that doctors and scientists are able to speak freely and to debate these issues without facing a witch hunt from the media, NHS trusts or academic bodies that employ them."</p>
<p>&rt; Professor Tim Spector, a leading epidemiologist at London’s King's College - who was awarded an OBE for his services to the Covid response - said: “There is a climate of fear and I have been personally attacked by other scientists on social media who I subsequently mute. It is not conducive to public debate.”</p>
<p>&rt; Robert Dingwall, a professor of Sociology from Nottingham Trent University said: "The picture of science presented here may surprise many people. Isn't it supposed to be a social world of civility, rigour and mutual respect, where ideas and people advance on their merits? However, sociologists who study the scientific community have long pointed out that it is really much like any other human institution. Some parts are, indeed, full of nice, collaborative people working together for the benefit of humanity. Others, though, are brutally competitive, marked by patronage, nepotism, bullying and personal antagonism. From the outside, you might not know that some of the current tensions around Covid science have their roots in events that happened 20 years ago and the sides that people took at the time. 'Following the science' is never neutral. It is always shaped by the connections that decide what counts as 'science' and the social networks that join scientists, journalists and politicians to favour some views over others."</p>
<p>&rt; This paper has been contacted by dozens of scientists who say they have strong views against the way the pandemic has been handled, but are unwilling to put their names to them because of fear of repercussions.</p>
<p>&rt; One academic who has spoken out is Jon Deeks, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Birmingham and expert on test evaluation, who has questioned the evidence supporting the use of lateral flow tests. He said the attacks were damaging to free speech. He said: “I have faced many defamatory things said to me on Twitter and to the media, including by other scientists who have even accused me of manipulating data. It becomes quite nasty. We are not talking to each other properly and there are many things we do not understand about this pandemic which we need to learn. But we are being thrown into confrontational positions on things, sometimes by the media and sometimes by the government. This is a bad atmosphere in which we can learn. Some of this culture is down to ego, but some people honestly believe only their way will solve things and will not listen to other peoples’ views. There is a range of disciplines including virologists, public health doctors, statisticians and clinicians and we don’t automatically understand each other.We don’t see the whole picture and it is very harmful in a pandemic if we are in a position where we cannot have a free discussion. I live on the positive support from the scientific community and I will not engage in this. I did get a bit down but many colleagues, my family and my teenage children have helped me to keep questioning where policy is not following science. In terms of protecting freedom of speech the university that I work with is incredibly supportive and the vice chancellor has said it is his job to enable me to do my job, and they see public questioning of science as my job.”</p>
<p>&rt; Professor Carl Heneghan, Director of Oxford University’s Centre for Evidence Based Medicine said: “An envelope of fear has engulfed the debate around covid. Scientists who suggested an alternative way have been subject to attack, ridicule and threats by others. I have been called an “agent of disinformation” and one scientist even called me a “public health threat” on twitter. I’m happy to discuss any issue where people believe I got something wrong. But Science only operates if it continually opens up questions, uncertainty and debate. There is no such thing as “the science.”"</p>
<p>&rt; A consultant in the north of England said: “Many of us clinicians want to put more emphasis on the unintended consequences of lockdown that are harming people and these stories need looking at with the same vigour as coronavirus. But everyone is so terrified of speaking out. I know of one senior NHS manager who was threatened with job loss..”</p>
<p>&rt; Allyson Pollock, a leading public health professor said funding also played a part because a significant proportion of academic research funds and university revenue is derived from the government.
She said: “Universities don't want to upset the government because they rely on government  funding. If academics criticise government policies there is often pushback.” </p>
<p>&rt; Dr Kamran Abbasi Executive of the BMJ said: “Increasingly NHS clinicians are unable to express their concerns about the NHS service provision in case they are deemed to stray into political territory.”
He added: “Science is about debate and rarely absolute. Once we start attacking each other it has gone out of the realm of science and become personal. However debate needs to be encouraged as it is only this way that we can get closer to the truth.”</p>
<p>&rt; A spokesman for the General Medical Council which regulates registered doctors said: “Good medical practice says that doctors must treat colleagues fairly and with respect. As outlined in our social media guidance, this expectation covers all situations and all forms of interaction and communication. We say doctor’s must not bully, harass, or make gratuitous, unsubstantiated or comments about individuals online.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, my dad is a doctor, more specifically a penumologist, he deals with covid on a regular basis and afer seeing the protests that are happening, and seeing you pov beacouse they had one of you on the radio, he had this to say:</p>

        <p>I did read the article. Do you know what this proffesor deals with? Cardiovascular deases. Also, if most scientists agree that the lockdown is the best way of containg covid, doesn't that raise a red flag?</p>

        <p>First of all - covid very much is a disease affecting the cardiovascular system. Glad you don't know that but you're telling me to trust the science. </p>
<p>The person in the meme you're commenting on is a Professor of Epidemiology at Harvard who was censored on Twitter recently: https://twitter.com/MartinKulldorff/status/1376292359718248452</p>
<p>He and 2 other Professors of Epidemiology wrote the Great Barrington declaration signed by 13,796 medical &amp; public health scientists and 41,890 medical practitioners (all with credentials posted).</p>
<p>The science is decided then?</p>

        <p>Yes it affect the cardiovascular system, but it doesn't spred from person to person like that.</p>
<p>Also, shut up with the Barrington declaration, it doesn't say not to wear a mask and not to vaccinate, it just says that the restrictions are too tight. You guys completely refuze the vaccine and any sort of restrictions</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if you're a teenager or a little slow but I've already told you that the majority of us believe the virus is real, the restrictions are overkill and even "Focused Protection" (what the GDB advocates for) means completely opening society and shielding only the elderly and vulnerable. But you seem to have issues reading/spelling so I'm not surprised you're confused by it.</p>

        <p>And you've clearly not talked to people on this sub. Most of them completely deny the virus, or if they believe in it they say it's not dangerous. Yes, there will be exceptions, people who have some common sense, like you, but most don't.</p>

        <p>What it seems like to me, is that there is a small group of scientists expressing concern over the way lockdowns have affected us, suggested alternate ways of handling the pandemic and were berated by the media, while the majority of researchers seem to agree that lockdowns are the best way to get rid of the virus.</p>

        <p>No the "majority" don't. If they're being bullied, coerced and cajoled into science as the article I posted says they are - featuring a few scientists who were brave enough to speak on record and many who wanted their names excluded to protect their jobs/family/safety - then that is not a majority at all.</p>
<p>Not to mention on the main page of the <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">Great Barrington Declaration</a> in addition to the 3 epidemiologists who created it, there are 45 other public names of scientists and their credentials as well as 13,796 medical &amp; public health scientists and 41,890 medical practitioners (all with credentials posted) that have signed it as well.</p>
<p>Tell me again what the majority is please? And do you have a peer-reviewed paper or any actual scientific evidence whatsoever to back up your claim? Didn't think so.</p>

        <p>So I took a look at the site you sent, there are only 443 medical health professionals who signed with their name, country, and field. </p>
<p>Let's look at pure numbers though. I grabbed a number from Wikipedia, I'm sure there's a more accurate number out there, but according to their demographics page there are over 950,000 practicing physicians in the United States. If we take the number from your site, which includes physicians outside of the United States, we can "say" that 22% of physicians have "grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies"</p>
<p>But, here's the thing, I'm looking at their submission form and it seems to be a simple text entry box with only reCaptcha v2 verification. I specialize in digital automation and I can say with certainty that it is possible to make a script which sends valid looking information, while also providing 2captcha cookies in no time. </p>
<p>Am I missing something? Thanks in advance.</p>

        <p>The GBD now has to vet each name individually in order for it to be added to the public list as trolls decided to try to sabotage it to prove a point. </p>
<p>They mention it on the signatures page: </p>
<p>&rt; "Signatures of Medical &amp; Public Health Scientists will be made public below after verification, approval, and vetting process. This is a publicly available form however all false, unverifiable, or questionable signatures will be removed. We will continue to update this page with verified, approved, and vetted signatures as time allows."</p>
<p>And if you look at the article I posted in other comments here, many scientists are afraid to sign their name to anything or speak out publicly for fear of backlash.</p>
<p>But people like you say "The science is settled. The entire scientific community unanimously agree and there is no debate." </p>
<p>I mean, people like us are just "anti-science" right?</p>
<p>Here's a peer reviewed &amp; published SCIENTIFIC paper from January 2021 saying that lockdowns serve no purpose:</p>
<p>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13484</p>
<p>&rt; "...no clear, significant beneficial effect of [more restrictive measures] on case growth in any country. We do not question the role of all public health interventions, or of coordinated communications about the epidemic, but we fail to find an additional benefit of stay-at-home orders and business closures,” the study says. Similar reductions in case growth may be achievable with less‐restrictive interventions.”</p>
<p>...but your uncited "guestimations" and random speculations are super scientific and relevant too I'm sure. /s</p>

        <p>Most people in this sub aren’t stating that Covid isn’t real.  I’m not saying that.  What we are saying is, among other things, that there is a lack of discussion and debate.  Any one who even has a question or doubt  about the vaccine or lockdown is ostracized by their peers and society in general (see: your own comment about what your father said).  This is the most troubling thing.  Not being allowed to even discuss how this is being handled is, frankly, unscientific.</p>
