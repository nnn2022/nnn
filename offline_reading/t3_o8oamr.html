    <strong>Alright Lets Talk about The Spoon thing That people are Noticing</strong>
    <p><p>Alright y'all, I'm not a conspiracy nut, no qanon bullshit none of that. But being a curious being when presented with objective evidence I cant just ignore it. </p>
<p>My grandma got the poke about 6 weeks ago, thankfully she did not have any side effects. Then my mom was forced to take the poke 3 weeks ago by her job, same as before thankfully besides a sore arm, no serious side effects. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now please understand, my mom is very bright in some areas but a total boomer in others. One of the areas that she's a boomer is news consumption; <strong>she gets the majority of her news from the newspaper ffs.....</strong> So it's not like she saw this online and thought I was funny to try. </p>
<p>Well, one of her coworkers told her about magnetic or potentially magnetic items sticking to the coof poke site. She naturally thinks her coworker is full of shit and tires is herself. WELL THE SPOON FUCKING STICKS to the poke site. She moves the spoon and it does't stick, moves back to the poke site and bam, it sicks. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Well now my mom finding this incredibly amusing *sigh......*  calls me to tell me. Again me being a very objective with a healthy skeptical mind I think she's yanking my chain. I FaceTime her and ask her to show me and she's not lying. Still thinking she's trying to mess with me I tell her I'm driving over to her pace where she and my grandma live. Oh yea, my grandma also has a case of the bionic arm. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So I get over to her place, greet her and my grandma and ask her to show me. In front of my eyes the spoon stuck to the poke site. Wanting to be objective I grab the spoon that she was using, grabbed an identical spoon and another two spoons from separate sets. Washed all of them with regular dish soap and dried them with a paper towel. All 4 spoons stuck to the poke site and the poke site only for both my mom and grandma. Then I repeated the cleaning process and tired it on my self and my brother (we haven't been poked) and the spoons did not stick at all on any point. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now I know there are a bunch of nutty antivaxx people I'm not one of them. I have all my shots, even shots that aren't FDA approved because I lived outside of the country for an extended period of time. When I moved back stateside my vaccinations records were lost so I had to get all the required shots to go needed to enroll in public school <strong>twice</strong>. But honestly WTF is in these damn experimental shots?! I've received vaccines in third world countries that didn't make my arm magnetic. Of course I tried to search the web for info but as expected all I got was articles by "experts" claiming it's not true. And with the cocksuckers that run social media are taking down all info on it under the guise of "fake news." Knowing how this works in 3 months we'll be hearing how "some" people might have this fucking insane side effect just like the "oh theres not link between the poke and and heart inflammation" to "FDA adds warning to the poke about potential heart inflammation."  </p>
<p>Has anybody here have have any info on this or experienced this? Or know where I can find info on this that hasn't been delisted, de indexed, or censored to hell? My mom and grandma seem fine but this is clearly not fucking normal.</p></p>

        <p>Nothing about the situation we have been in since early 2020 is normal. </p>
<p>Vaccines usually take years of safety testing before being released for human use. What we are actually seeing is a vaccine rollout like nothing before in history. All the current COVID vaccines are in the testing phase and we are all the lab rats. Numerous doctors and nurses have spoken about this, though of course as you mention these videos don’t seem to last. </p>
<p>There is no conspiracy. Everything you thought was crazy is actually real. At least that is how it feels to me.

        <p>Yup, happened to my mom. Her arm became magnetic at the injection site, it started in about a dollar coin sized area, and spread out across her arm over a few weeks and then it stopped being magnetic a week or so ago. I don't care what people say about it, it happened and I saw/felt it myself. Other people's skepticism doesn't make the experience any less real. Believe me or not, I don't give a fuck.</p>

        <p>The fact that the msn and social media are in lockstep saying it isn’t true was my first hint that something was off. </p>
<p>I believe you, I saw it in  person too with my own two eyes. I approached this with a completely skeptic and objective mind and saw the same thing. This isn’t 1984, in can’t ignore something I saw with my own eyes because the ministry of truth says it isn’t so.</p>

        <p>Exactly! I actually tried it on my mom to prove it wrong. I argued with people about it being fake. Imagine my shock and surprise when the magnet stuck!  To all those I disbelieved and argued with: I'm sorry. Truly.</p>

        <p>I did it to two people It was clearly magnetic And we had a laugh about it even though it certainly is not funny… I have to wonder if some of the most magnetic people have had MRIs with contrast or some other similar injection / intervention...</p>

        <p>The only thing I've seen that makes any sort of sense, is that it's something that helps whatever is in the "vaccine" to do its job. But if that's the case, why does it only happen to a percentage of the people getting it (I'm fully aware that it doesn't happen to most people) and why are they telling us this isn't happening (when clearly a lot of people have experienced it)? Why not just tell us that this is a possible side effect? So hell if I know. What I don't think it is, is a microchip or tracking device. If it was, it would have stayed in one spot and it wouldn't have gone away in my mom.</p>

        <p>Ill try to find the article, but I read that things like  Lanthanide is being used to help deliver drugs or synthetic modRNA straight into human cells (I say “mod” because it’s not messenger RNA as the goal is to modify the DND). There’s also other science papers out there discussing how these new covid vaccines use some sort of ferrite or ferrite-like material to help the vaccines travel throughout the body to modify certain types of cells.</p>

        <p>My question is why not just openly disclose this. Pharma companies were essentially given a blank check by the government to rush this out. Could none of that money been used for a simple explanation graphic or video in terms that the layman can understand so people know what’s going on and don’t freak out unnecessarily? </p>
<p>Keeping this shit on the down low instead of openly and transparently explaining why this could happen is <strong>exactly</strong> how conspiracies start.</p>

        <p>I totally agree, but if you will allow me, I wish to delve into the esoteric realm of all of this absurdity that we've been witnessing for the past 1.5 years. </p>
<p>Okay, before I tell you my crazy theory, let me start off with this -&rt; "If I told you back as early as 2018 (yes that far back as my early warning bells went off) that all of your civil liberties would be crushed, and that you'd have to mask-up when being in public places, and you'd face possible mandatory vaccination, and <strong><em>all over a bad flu</em></strong> no less, you'd think I was on drugs or a crazy person, right? Okay, well, just keep reading: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1) The goal is to slowly transmogrify human DNA &amp; flesh to integrate silicon-based nano-materials &amp; nano-machinery whereby we can integrate to a super advanced A.I. bio-mechanical entity, for the purposes of creating the first ever human brain to computer worldwide mesh network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2) The theory is that once we're all integrated as "one" (i.e. think of the Borg collective) then the phenomenon called a "Singularity" will take place; a point at which humanity has "unlocked" or achieved a breakthrough technology where we will grow as an advanced species exponentially. This "meshing" would allow this super A.I. to not only <strong>predict</strong> what a person(s) or group(s) would do for a particular action (i.e. having the super power of <strong><em>omniscient</em></strong>), but it could somewhat see the future, and change a particular outcome by swaying (or forcing) the actions of the present world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3) The reason why the ones orchestrating this (let's call them the NWO) is because they have foreknowledge of an upcoming event that could potentially spell mankind's doom. What that is, I don't want to say yet, but your guess is good as mine or anyone else's. They think by having this power of omniscience that no matter what humanity encounters (either from natural calamities to space invaders to things that would turn your hair white) that we could know ahead of time and always come out on top. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4) I think in order to achieve the connectivity issues with a lot of data being uploaded and downloaded would require 5G or perhaps 6G wireless technologies to come into effect, but there are many places around the world that don't even have robust wireless networks, so the only thing I can think of assisting the NWO is possibly Elon Musk's Starlink satellite ring orbiting the Earth. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5) I could go on &amp; on, but to keep this short, the NWO is under the influence of a very deceiving malevolent entity who considers humanity nothing more than farm animals. The NWO is either being tricked or were told that the above 3 bullet points are just a farce, and that the true goal is to entrap humanity from <strong>Ascension</strong> or awakening from this prison planet. Our souls keep getting recycled via reincarnation, but we're supposed to eventually escape this simulated prison, which would cause the death/destruction of this entity (it somehow needs to feed off of our soul energy, much like how people need farm animals for sustenance, but I don't know the exact mechanics of how we're fed upon). Our Solar System is slowly reaching the Milky Way Galaxy's equator, and the theory is that humanity will spiritually advance beyond our imaginations. This entity's time is running short, hence why everything these days seems rushed. I personally feel that this entity (or it's minions) fucked-up somehow, and are frantically trying to ensure "The Plan" goes through fine, but they did not account for several variables, one of which I think are some forces of Good who are fighting this enemy behind the scenes. Time will tell if this information will reach the light of day though.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Going back to what I earlier mentioned, here you go:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This medical paper is called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4945403/"><strong>"Lanthanides: Applications in Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy"</strong></a>, whereby lanthanide's versatile chemical and magnetic properties help with "drug/gene delivery" among other things. The point of me mentioning this to you is that there are things that even I wasn't aware about until someone brought this to my attention several weeks ago. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going back to the <strong><em>magnetic</em></strong> properties of these covid-vaccines, Ryan Christian (aka The Last American Vagabond) discussed it in <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/pcr-illusion-continues-covid-your-dna-vax-mix-match-back-state-emergency-politics/"><strong>this video</strong></a>, but it's rather long, so you might have to watch it in chunks. You can just watch this more shorter version discussing the actual magnetic properties <a href="https://odysee.com/@TLAVagabond:5/TDWU-Clip---June-4,-2021---Magnetic-Nano-Particles:1"><strong>here</strong></a>, but if you want the source of where he got his information from, please refer to the medical paper called <a href="https://jnanobiotechnology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12951-019-0506-y"><strong>Biochemical functionality of magnetic particles as nanosensors: how far away are we to implement them into clinical practice?</strong></a>, as it has some good layman's terms in there that helped me understand the mechanics of this shitfuckery happening inside of these vaccines. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow the work of Whitney Webb and Ryan Christian. There's others to follow, but for now those two are ones that I trust the most when it comes to the science, as well as esoteric topics that no one wants to talk about (yet). Thank you.</p>

        <p>I'm in the same boat as you Op. I kept hearing about the magnetic thing but I thought it was some bullshit to make people who are skeptical of the shot seem crazy.</p>
<p>Well, my father brought this up about a week ago, he says hey did you hear the shot makes people magnetic?  I said yeah but I thought people were making it up. He proceeded to put a penny on his forehead and it stuck. He then put the penny on the injection site and it stuck. I even put the penny on his forehead too because I still didn't believe it. You could feel the magnetic pull. Now, my mother also got the shot but was not magnetic. I think some people might have a natural magnetism even before the shot and they are realizing it now because they never tested it before. Or the shot really is doing this but only to some people for whatever reason.</p>

        <p>Pennies aren’t generally magnetic, though, right? They never stick to the fridge, for instance. And as for not noticing a natural magnetism before, surely at some point everyone has encountered some piece of magnetic material. It seems highly unlikely that anyone would have been slightly magnetic their entire lives and not noticed.</p>

        <p>My father claimed it had something to do with non ferrus metals. I'm not well versed in the science of magnetism. He was also able to do it with a paper clip. We didnt have any fridge magnets to try it with but I have a magnetic clasp on bracelet that we tried and it was too heavy to stick but you could feel a pull from it when placed in the middle of his forehead.</p>

She had videos up of all these people doing EMF readings on the vaccinated. They’re all radioactive afterward. Idk what these people have running through their bodies, but whatever it is, it makes EMF readers go crazy.</p>

        <p>Ok so here are my thoughts: There have been magicians / scammers since forever who claim they are magnetic. It's usually simply friction. People like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xammaXItWp0">this one</a>. I feel like I don't have to explain this further. Now, every single video I have seen of people being magnetic after the shot look exactly like that. Hundreds of million of people got those shots. I feel like if they were actually magnetic, at least one should have been able to produce an at least somewhat convincing video of the phenomena. There are many ways, just one to get you an idea: Put a piece of magnetic metal on a string, hold it like a pendulum, so the string goes straight down. Now slowly move it to the supposedly magnetic part of someones body. When you get close to it, you should see the piece of metal move closer, the string should not go straight down anymore, but at a small angle. This is what I would do if I thought I was magnetic. Please, try this with your mother and share your results. Of course, if you got more convincing videos that I missed: share them. Until then: I call bullshit.</p>
