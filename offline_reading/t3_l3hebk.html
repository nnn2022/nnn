<title>Why did the narrative of vaccines suddenly change? Why were vaccines capable of eliminating disease, but now they don't stop you from catching or transmitting a disease? Is this another psyop by the Anti-Vax crowd?</title>

    <strong>Why did the narrative of vaccines suddenly change? Why were vaccines capable of eliminating disease, but now they don't stop you from catching or transmitting a disease? Is this another psyop by the Anti-Vax crowd?</strong>
    <p><p>Came here from a tooafraidtoask post that is currently one of the most top voted on the 'hot' page.</p>
<p>If a vaccine doesn't stop you from catching a disease or spreading it what is the point? Polio and Smallpox were both eliminated (Polio almost is) through herd immunity through vaccines.</p>
<p>But suddenly vaccines don't stop you catching something or preventing you from transmitting it?</p>
<p>Excuse me, what? Who came up with this nonsense? Years ago that was what Anti Vaxxers were saying, that a measles or tetanus shot won't stop you from catching or transmitting tetanus or measles and vaccines are almost useless.</p></p>

        <p>That narrative of them “eliminating” Covid was another doomer fantasy pushed just like the idea that everyone locked down for 2 weeks we’d all be back to normal.</p>
<p>Covid is here to stay. Even with a vaccine. It’s been made clear that this vaccine helps with the symptoms but no evidence that it will stop spread. Hence the reason why you STILL have to distance and mask up with it </p>

        <p>The vaccines have not been tested in such a way as to prove they prevent infection or transmission. These aren't really vaccines in the traditional sense anyway, it's more of an experimental genetic therapy drug.  Do some research and read the actual clinical trials. They are very limited in scope and do not inspire confidence.</p>
<p>Why anyone would willing sign up to take on of these at this stage on development is beyond me</p>

        <p>Just because they stick it in your arm doesn't mean it does what they claim it will.  Clinical trials have not been completed to test the HYPOTHESIS that injecting this drug will prevent you from contracting Covid or subsequently passing it on to others.  That needs to be tested in an experiment with a control group, over a longer enough period of time that the results are statistically significant.  </p>
<p>The Phase III human trials are really just starting now, also the emergency use authorization gives the pharma companies the ability to do away with the control group. Can't have anyone staying with the placebo during a gLoBaL paDemiC right?  These companies are also exempt from any liability if side effects occur.  </p>
<p>Have pharma companies ever pushed an unsafe drug to market that later had to be recalled due to horrific side effects. Can we know what side effects will occur 1 year down the road if nobody has had this drug for more than 6 months?</p>

        <p>Coronaviruses are notoriously difficult to vaccinate against, but nowhere near as difficult as viruses are to eliminate. Anyone saying a vaccine would mean an immediate return to normal life and pushing for 'zero cases' was <em>always</em> talking bollocks. The crime isn't that politicians are gutless liars (we know that...). The crime is that they built their pandemic response on gutless lies, so now we've thrown a generation down the drain for literally no benefit - except that of the same uber-rich people who left our health services in such a mess in the first place, both through tax avoidance and directing their funds towards war and commercial technology rather than health technology, which <em>easily</em> would have made us all immortal on Mars by now if it received the same amount of funding war does.</p>

        <p>No.  You can’t have vaccinated people romping around without a care in the world while millions stand in the back of the line.  You’d have riots outside every cvs in the country.</p>
