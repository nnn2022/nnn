    <strong>Quite the song for today</strong>
    <p><p>Maybe its not your jam - but this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4K9xid96G3YmIvQZXN9SXg?si=hg9fle0dRxG-gqukBeNDtw">song</a> (spotify link) has really affected me lately, reminds me so much of whats wrong with the world today - the "lyrics" (its just speaking over the music) are from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts">Alan Watts</a> and feels prophetic for its time, if anything I just hope it gives you the same want to disconnect a bit as it has me. It just really reminds me of how sucked into the "fake" online world we tend to be, and how we really need to engage in the "real" one.</p>
<p>The lyrics: </p>
<p>&rt;A person who thinks all the time</p>
<p>&rt;Has nothing to think about except thoughts</p>
<p>&rt;So, he loses touch with reality</p>
<p>&rt;And lives in a world of illusions</p>
<p>&rt;By thoughts, I mean specifically, chatter in the skull</p>
<p>&rt;Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words</p>
<p>&rt;Of reckoning and calculating</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not saying that thinking is bad</p>
<p>&rt;Like everything else, It's useful in moderation</p>
<p>&rt;A good servant, but a bad master</p>
<p>&rt;And all so-called civilized peoples</p>
<p>&rt;Have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive</p>
<p>&rt;Because, through excessive thinking</p>
<p>&rt;They have lost touch with reality</p>
<p>&rt;That's to say</p>
<p>&rt;We confuse signs</p>
<p>&rt;With the real world</p>
<p>&rt;This is the beginning of meditation...</p>
<p>&rt;Most of us would have</p>
<p>&rt;Rather money than tangible wealth</p>
<p>&rt;And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed</p>
<p>&rt;And to read about it the next day in the newspaper</p>
<p>&rt;Is oddly more fun for us than the original event</p>
<p>&rt;This is a disaster!</p>
<p>&rt;For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs</p>
<p>&rt;We are destroying nature</p>
<p>&rt;We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses</p>
<p>&rt;Time to wake up</p>
<p>&rt;What is reality? Obviously no one can say</p>
<p>&rt;Because it isn't words</p>
<p>&rt;It isn't material, that's just an idea</p>
<p>&rt;Reality IS.</p>
<p>&rt;The point cannot be explained in words</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not trying to put you down</p>
<p>&rt;It's an expression of you as you are</p>
<p>&rt;One must live</p>
<p>&rt;We need to survive, to go on</p>
<p>&rt;We must go on</p>
<p>&rt;-- Alan Watts</p></p>
