    <strong>Does anyone else find the term "face covering" and "facial covering" to be far more irksome than "mask"?</strong>
    <p><p>I imagine that I'm not alone in finding the term "face covering" and "facial covering" as a term for the masks that everyone insists that we wear to be more irksome than simply calling them masks.  I wonder if it's because the term was introduced during coronavirus, while calling something like this a mask is as old as the hills.  In any case, it grates on me every time I hear it.</p></p>

        <p>Yep it's weird Orwellian language meant to make it seem "not so bad".</p>
<p>Just like "social distancing" instead of "acting like a freak and being scared of other human beings."</p>
<p>Or "we're all in this together" instead of "You all need to obey and not be an individual".</p>
<p>etc</p>

        <p>Yup. It all makes me sick. And they say "social distancing" like it's been there all along, and we were just fortunate not to have to implement it until now. And the signs, so ominous. Did this term exist before COVID?</p>

        <p>People have socially distanced during previous outbreaks, but they didn't call it "social distancing". The word itself seems to be a recent thing (I didn't do a lot of research so someone can correct me). 
https://i.imgur.com/k6mxGWB.jpg</p>
<p>Here's the Wikipedia page on it:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing</p>
<p>This bit is interesting:
"An empirical study published in July 2020 in The BMJ (British Medical Journal) analyzed data from 149 countries, and reported an average of 13% reduction in COVID-19 incidence after the implementation of social distancing policies." </p>
<p>So all this damage to the very psyche of human beings, by making us treat each other like dangerous contagions... For a THIRTEEN PERCENT BENEFIT. </p>
<p>Wow.</p>

        <p>I hate the word "mask." I mean, I really HATE that word. But I also hate the word "cases" when discussing a person who has tested positive, since a "case" involves medical treatment, not just a test result.</p>
<p>And all of that pales next to "social distancing." The term correctly refers to reducing the number of physical social contacts you have, not to the distance between people in public. That distinction was lost in the US, because we locked down and eliminated all physical social contacts. So it became the buzzword for "six feet apart," instead of "call your parents instead of going to their house for dinner."</p>

        <p>To me, it usually indicates that they either have no symptoms or just a cold. Otherwise, we'd describe them as having been "hospitalized" or "recovering at home."</p>

        <p>The fact that the only headlines on that other sub are anecdotes of 5, or 10, or 20 people testing positive shows me how fucking pathetic this whole thing is. Like some kids tested positive. So fucking what?? That's what we want!! Did they think "flattening the curve" meant no cases ever again. Now they have to report each individual one like its news?!

        <p>(i hope that this is not insensitive of me to say, i respect all religions and faiths. i understand that many Muslim woman chose to wear the hijab and that it's a very intimate, personal choice, and i personally respect their commitment to and practice of traditional Islamic standards of modesty.)</p>
<p>the more and more we start normalizing the mask, and calling it a "face covering" or "facial covering," the more i am starting to understand why some women in the Muslim world chose to wear the hijab/burqa/niqab and don't argue about it. i can see now how that sort of clothing has become normalized and accepted. if i were constantly being told that showing my hair or mouth or nose or skin was an affront to God, and that i needed to veil myself, i would probably just do it to stop being publicly shamed and judged.</p>
<p>in fact, if people keep nagging me about the mask, forcing me to cover myself in public at all times in public, i might just start wearing a burqa myself. it's more comfortable than the mask, i won't be constantly touching my face, it won't be itchy, it won't slip down my nose. some burqas are very fashionable. no one will ask me to cover my hair anymore, or get it cut to prevent the spread of covid-19. honestly, that's where i am this morning.</p>
<p>this is what we are normalizing with the mask - it's a face veil. we are separating ourselves from the world. if we don't stop it now, we will wear a mask in public for the rest of our lives, without questioning it. look what happened to the women of Iran and Afghanistan - it's happening here with the mask.</p>

        <p>I'm not Muslim, but I got a burqa at the beginning of this, the big, Afghani-style one. It started as almost performance art: of you're uncomfortable seeing someone in slave garb, think more deeply about forcing people to cover their faces over a damn flu. Obviously, the average Covid Coward is too stupid to get it, but I had fun. Anyway, it's much more comfortable and breathable than a mask, and it makes me less angry. I chose to wear that burqa (for trolling purposes, and otherwise). I don't wear the thing they're forcing in be because their hypochondriac mask fetish.</p>

        <p>KUDOS TO YOU! where did you find one, just out of curiosity? i've seen some truly beautiful burqas. my best friend is Turkish, and he said some wealthy Muslim women in Saudi Arabia and the UAE actually have Chanel/Dior/Givenchy et al make their burqas. can you even imagine? they must be beautiful and comfortable and chic. i mean, if i'm going to dress like a beekeeper, i want to be fancy as fuck. also, i'm intrigued by all the potential for pockets. like sure, you can't see my face, but look at all the pockets! (i've also seen some gorgeous embroidered burqas from Afghanistan and Pakistan, i'd totally wear those in a heartbeat.)</p>
<p>i honestly think that some of these pro-maskers would absolutely lose their shit if they started seeing non-Muslim women wear burqas in public en masse. i think if they saw me, a blond haired, blue eyed woman, casually wearing a burqa on the street, they'd freak out. they'd tell me, "baby no, you don't have to wear a burqa, you are free! you are no man's property! god loves you anyway! take off your veil!"</p>
<p>well right now if i go to the grocery store without a mask on, people scream at me that i'm killing grandma and i'm worse than Hitler and the virus doesn't care who you are, put your damn mask on! "mask it or casket!" "your mask protects me, my mask protects you."</p>
<p>GET BENT.</p>
<p>if this is the future they want, i need to call the House of Dior. i need five work burqas, stat. i'll call them "worqas."</p>

        <p>eBay! It's actually a very pretty green chiffon, with hand-done embroidery! Mine shipped from Pakistan and arrived in about two weeks - I was surprised. If you look up jilbabs, chadors, etc, you get some nice ones! I went for the full face one, just because it seems to freak people out the most. I have an Iranian one from Goodwill, too, which covers the face but is easier to see in.</p>
<p>Those dumbasses in the grocery store wouldn't get the irony of thinking the gal in the burqa is oppressed, while supporting mask mandates. I have a mask that says, "I'm not a sheep, I just need groceries", which pisses off certain cashiers. Totally different response when I wear the burqa! If  I'm LITERALLY Hitler the granny killer, may as well be able to breathe!</p>

        <p>wow, that sounds absolutely gorgeous! i actually started looking into the types of hijabs after i came up with this nutty idea, and my god, some of them are stunning. i didn't know there were so many varieties, and which kind of hijab you wear in which situation, and so many rules, and even the scholarly discussions of whether or not women must wear the hijab. (i'm very interested in the idea that the hijab is a physical partition between the dirty secular world of humans and the sacred spiritual plane of God. does that mean women are always liminal spaces? i have to know more about this!)</p>
<p>Iranian women always seem really classically chic and put-together, even now in their hijabs. but the ones from Afghanistan and Pakistan with all of the embroidery and bright colors just speak to my bohemian aesthetic. </p>
<p>i supposed if i end up actually following through with this, i'd go with the burqa so that you could only see my eyes, for the sole purpose of upsetting people. also, i feel like i really need to commit to covering myself, so i should see how far i can go with it. </p>
<p>i'd like one where the face veil can "drop" away from the mouth/nose - maybe with a button or a ribbon or a clip/broach, so that when i sit down to eat in public, i don't remove the head covering entirely. i'm sure women who wear these in real life don't take the entire head covering off just to eat in public, and i'm sure they can eat in some public places. maybe not in front of men, but surely in front of other women. i wish i could ask these questions to a Muslim woman without sounding like a complete fucking idiot!</p>

        <p>I also wish I could talk to a Muslim woman about it without sounding like an idiot! 😹 I'm Shinto, and the veil as a barrier between the sacred and profane seems so similar to the torii gates in front of every Shinto shrine: a gate between the irreverent outer world, and the pure shrine. The concept is endlessly fascinating!</p>
<p>It's relatively easy for me to stay covered under the Afghani burqa, as it's nearly floor length. My neighborhood being Japanese makes it even easier, as it's fairly common to see women (and some men!) wear gloves, long sleeves, etc for sunblock purposes. An aside, it's also the reason I get so pissed when doomers try to pull the, "But the Japanese wear masks all day, every day!!1!1!1!" bullshit.</p>

        <p>But the difference between "face covering" vs "mask and "cotton swab" vs "Q-tip" is that "Q-tip" is a brand name brand and "mask" is not. Honestly, I don't even know where the name "Q-tip" comes from. The word "cotton" doesn't start with a Q. If anything, calling all cotton swabs "Q-tip" regardless of actual brand grinds my gears even more, like calling all tissues "Kleenex", all pads/tampons "Kotex", any clear tape "Scotch Tape", or any household disinfectant "Lysol". Then again, I somewhat prefer the word "face covering" over "mask" because it implies I can wear a scarf or bandana instead of a medical mask.</p>

        <p>It's very telling.  The point of wearing the masks isn't to stop a virus from spreading, it's to <em>cover your face</em>.  They want people to feel disconnected from each other and alienated.  They want to dehumanize us, same reason why they're trying so hard to gaslight everyone into thinking of themselves as nothing more than a walking disease vector, rather than an actual human being.</p>

        <p>Yeah. Language can be a psychological weapon, and trying to make something bad seem good by giving it a more positive or at least neutral name is an old, old tactic they still use because it still works. One way to fight back is to call things what they really are. Though I think "new normal," "stay at home order" (and the ten times worse "safer at home" - ugh, no, and also <em>inaccurate</em> unless you live alone in a single-family building) etc. are more of a problem than "face covering" since "mask" is only mildly negative on its own and "face covering" isn't strongly positive.</p>

        <p>To me, the fact that places like Wal-Mart and Target are mandating “face coverings” but not masks shows that it is all security theater and I find it laughable.</p>
<p>So you could walk in wearing a thin t-shirt wrapped around your face and it’s supposedly just as effective as medical-grade PPE.  It is so stupid and ridiculous I can’t help but shake my head and laugh.</p>

        <p>I dislike it as well, but I think there is a less nefarious reason behind it. In Utah, there is a state "face covering" mandate in public buildings and schools. The reason why they used "face covering" instead of "mask" was to allow more options like face shields, bandanas, etc. I think they just wanted to make the term more broad in order to encourage more compliance.
