    <strong>Thinking of fighting against the masks at my school, not exactly sure about how I will go about that though.</strong>
    <p><p>So I live in a small town of around 3000 people. I'm 18 and a senior in high school, yes I'm a conservative at just 18 and I'm woke to the fact that covid is a hoax and my parents are strongly against it too all the way back to last April. My high school has around 300 people. </p>
<p>Right now the only kind of action I'm taking is posting to my roughly 50 facebook friends so I only get to a few people. I post about the covid hoax and all the news that has been going on since around last August. </p>
<p>My state has a mask mandate so that doesn't really help the situation but I was wondering if there is some way that I can fight against it. There are a few people I know that may be willing to join me but that's not enough to make an impact. I notice there are a decent amount of other people who wear it below their nose so that's a good sign. Although I'm not sure if they do that because they think it's a hoax or only because they're uncomfortable and need to breathe oxygen, or both. Most teachers don't even care or say anything about it which is nice because I can do it about 80% of the time. I'm thankful for that because it makes school much less miserable to not have to wear masks all the way up for 6 fucking hours a day.</p>
<p>Now I only have about 10 more weeks of school, actually only half of that because there's a thing where everyone is in 2 groups and each group goes in every other day which kinda sucks and doesn't allow me to reach as many people. I want to fight against that too. I can try making a petition and get a good amount of people to sign it. I know a lot of the facts on why covid is a hoax but I'm not sure how I'll get to people who have doubts about that or are liberals (although probably over 95% don't really have any political views yet because under 18). Maybe more liberals will go along with it since there are vaccines now and supposedly people with high risk can't get it now so they would be more willing to take the damn things off already. But I'm willing to bet some people want to be slaves and wear the masks forever. The masks are never coming off unless more people stand up and take them off. Like I said I post on facebook and maybe get a few views on my posts. Sometimes I get a like or two. </p>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>Start asking people how cloth prevents micro particles and then go on to ask how it prevents nanoparticles because that‚Äôs what Covid particles consist of. If they bring up droplets point out how common folk literally made videos of how easily visible ‚Äúdroplets‚Äù  from vapes passes on right through. If that isn‚Äôt enough you could point out how they are bacterial hot houses. You could also start teaching your friends about Kary Mullis and how he hated Fauci And stated himself that his creation (PCR tests) should never be used to identify if someone is sick.</p>

        <p>Look up "the white rose" print a load of stickers off and put them everywhere ü§£</p>
<p>Also, you can consider options for not wearing a mask. Maybe gather a load of information on asymptomatic spread, mask efficacy, risk to young people - and ask for a meeting with the school and make a case against mask wearing.</p>
<p>Good effort you! Good luck</p>

        <p>Just refuse to wear a mask and see if you can get others to join you. I got thrown out of my first religious studies class when I was 11, just for saying "what if I someone doesn't believe in god?' If you make a stand at least you'll feel good about yourself.</p>

        <p>Last day of school- bring an old skool boom box (for dramatic effect) Play "mask off" by future. Everyone you can get on board with it takes their masks off and does a flash mob. I'm only halfway joking</p>
