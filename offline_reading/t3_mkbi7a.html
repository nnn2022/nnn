    <strong>NNNs, This May Be The Most Important Podcast I Have Ever Heard! Please Listen And Share! Dr Mike Yeadon Talks About His Grave Concerns About The Coronavirus Shot</strong>
    <p><p>Not gonna lie, this is hard to listen to, but a former Pfizer VP and head of research has some very frightening things to say about the mRNA technology. Please listen if you care about your own life and the lives of others. </p>
<p>He seems credible to me. Degree in biochemistry and toxicology, PhD in pharmacology in respiratory, 32 years working for large pharmaceutical companies, left Pfizer 10 years ago, was most senior research person at Pfizer in charge of respiratory research. In the past 10 years has started, run and sold a biotech company. Knows immunology, infectious diseases, inflammation, testing, respiratory disciplines.</p>
<p>I know shills will attack this thread but try to remember everybody has an agenda. </p>
<p>Today my agenda is to ask you to think about what this guy is saying and talk it over with us here, and maybe share the link with a few people you care about if it seems sensible to you.</p>
<p>I honestly do not think I have ever heard a more important conversation. What are your thoughts?</p>

        <p>Mike Yeadon has been one of the go-to voices of informed skepticism since this started.  He was the one I learned about the fallibility of the PCR test from and how it was skewing the truth of the whole situation.</p>

        <p>If he wasn't saying the elderly should get this thing, I would start considering him to be pretty awesome. I feel really torn between admiring his courage and wanting to wake him up that this shot isn't safe for anyone. I still think he's brave to speak out against the untested nature of the mRNA shots.</p>

        <p>Honestly thanks for posting this, the main reason I love this sub is among all the chatter there are also posts like this. Not downtalking the chatter but information needs to be shared now more than ever with all the censorship from main outlets!</p>
<p>At work atm but really looking forward to listening later this evening.</p>

        <p>He used to be ultra pro vax, and even now he's saying the elderly should get this shady concoction, so it makes me wonder. But he does seem pretty awake despite that. I'm still evaluating. Let us know if you have more thoughts on it ok?</p>

        <p>It really does make you wonder “why?” Is it truly for the health &amp; well being of the global population? Or is there more sinister motives? </p>
<p>What makes me really suspicious is how tightly they control the narrative and the information online. For example, It’s totally creepy how this new technology is nearly 100% effective and perfect, yet if you have a history of posting here on No New Normal, you are immediately banned from posting on the Covid Vax Side Effects sub. </p>
<p>It truly weirds me out how tightly they control the narrative. I would be more open-minded if there was more of a ‘pro vs. con’ conversation happening across all platforms</p>

        <p>Yes! It raises a huge red flag for me when anybody forbids discussion of pros and cons of an issue. It's coercive, and it shows that the entities shoving their narrative at us are not honest. Honesty does not fear discussion, right?</p>

        <p>Scary stuff. I tend to agree w/ some of his concerns, like “why would we immediately try to Vaccinate 100% of the population with new technology that has had very little time in a real-world setting? Why roll out these vaccines on populations like healthy children when we know children have very little risk?”</p>
