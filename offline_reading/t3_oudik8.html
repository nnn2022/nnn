    <strong>How worried should we be?</strong>
    <p><p>So I'm one of 4 of my friends who hasn't taken the fauci fraud jab, how worried should I be abt my friends and even family creating an issue for me with spike protiens...my kids aren't vaxd nor will they be but they spend time with their jabbed grandparents, and I spend time with my jabbed friends...so how much transmission occurs with spike protein and am I just fucked for hanging out with them ( also in all fairness my fam and friends are reasonable ppl who don't push this shit I'm just worried abt vaccine contaigen )  I'm honestly more scared of hanging out with ppl who have it than those who don't</p>
<p>Edited for clarity</p></p>

        <p>Spike protein shedding is real. My wife got jabbed and developed “covid” within a week and within a day or so being the sickest she’s been in a decade I became sick myself with high heart rate and blood pressure. I never get the flu or worse than a runny nose or sore throat once a year.</p>
<p>It was the sickest I’ve been in my life and that was just being exposed to her for a few days while she was dealing with the spike overload and shedding it.</p>
<p>It’s about a two week window per jab that people are producing and shedding spikes.</p>
<p>If you’re worried don’t let family members around recently jabbed people for two weeks. Also I recommend ivermectin to reduce the damage the spikes cause if you have to be around them.</p>
<p>You can use horse paste if you can’t find a doctor or pharmacy to give you a prescription.</p>

        <p>Is it possible that you both.....had covid? None of the covid vaccines are effective within a week of the first shot. Did either of you test for it?</p>

        <p>First off, the tests are worthless, no useful data can be provided by a PCR test when it comes to diagnosing illness. This is especially the case when concerning the “vaccine” that produces trillions of spikes within your cells many of which are not membrane anchored—-which will cause you to test positive for covid even if the wild virus isn’t what you are infected with. Surprise surprise that injecting yourself with synthetic mrna that creates genetic material that matches wild covid would cause a positive test! Is this useful information? No.</p>
<p>Second, the spike protein itself is directly responsible for most of the damage covid does to people, it binds to endothelial cells and causes clotting in the bloodstream and capillaries which is why so many vaccinated have strokes heart attacks or myocarditis. </p>
<p>The entire theory behind the vaccine was that it would stay localized to the shoulder (it doesn’t, the lipid nanoparticles that encase the mrna travel throughout the body) and that the spikes would stay membrane anchored which they don’t.</p>
<p>While not technically giving you the wild virus, the vaccine can give all the symptoms of covid in individuals who have more free floating spikes that aren’t membrane anchored.</p>
<p>And it sheds according to the inventor of the mrna vaccine Robert Malone!</p>

        <p>There's so much "I'm smarter than you" misinformation here that I'm not sure where to start, so I'll just focus on the one thing you're right about -- yes, vaccines can definitely cause the same symptoms that covid does.</p>
<p>But they last for a day or three, and then you're back to normal.</p>
<p>Not to discount the people who have allergic reactions or blood clots; it's a small number but unfortunately not zero.</p>

        <p>We just won't know for a long time. I'd limit exposure as much as possible but if it really does work through protein shedding then we're all probably screwed anyway. I still dont intend to put myself in harm's way anymore than I have to tho</p>

        <p>Today on a radio talkshow they were having people call in to speak about their opinions on the vaccine. An older man was put on the line and he said something along the lines of this... (And I'm not exaggerating)  </p>
<p>"Everyone in my family is vaccinated. My friends are. We are sick and tired of having to tolerate and coerce these anti-vaxxers into getting the shot. Look at what France did and how Macron is handling it - that is what WE need. There must be mandates. They did the same thing with the smallpox vaccine and this is no difference, we may need to take that approach again".  </p>
<p>The radio hosts didn't even flinch or really find it that outrageous. Knowing that this type of sentiment is now being normalized is the most terrifying thing.  </p>
<p>Any sane and logical person would view this man as an uneducated paranoid FUCKING MENTAL CASE. Did he forget that he can still get Covid? Did he forget that he can still SPREAD IT? Did he forget that if his system suppresses the symptoms that he is now willingly becoming asymptomatic and spreading it to others - what anti-maskers were crucified for in the past (Despite not even being sick)?  </p>
<p>Rough times ahead.</p>
