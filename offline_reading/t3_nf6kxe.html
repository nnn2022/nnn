    <strong>What bothers me now is.</strong>
    <p><p>I am confounded by the gulf of perception between people who 'believe' and those who do not. I would like to understand how they cannot see the obvious destructiveness and malevolence of their new 'religion'.</p>
<p>The people get only what they ask for.<br>
What bothers me.</p>
<p>Is that when I look at the TV, I ask myself - who is this material/presentation intended to interact effectively with? It impresses me most powerfully, that such material as is routinely presented, is very obviously and blatantly designed for people who do not know anything. It is for people who know nothing. It is for people who are not competent. It is for people who are deficient. Several critical positive attributes must be absent or minimal in a body; If the presentation is to function as intended; Judgement, analysis, discrimination, intuition, induction, sensitivity to sincerity and authenticity - all such - must necessarily be negated and abolished prior to the toleration, the submission and the consent to the natural imaginative ideation being crudely, viciously and brutally driven, coerced and overwhelmed into an ideological and religious/evangelical creed of compliance, servitude and sacrifice - and so such a state of a consuming totality of terror prevails - a case in which - the absolute selflessness of a necessarily destroyed identity is perquisite.</p></p>
