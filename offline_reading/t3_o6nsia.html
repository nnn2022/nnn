    <strong>Is anyone LEGITIMATELY still afraid of covid at this point?</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t know a single person who is. There’s one person on my Facebook feed who still virtue signals about it a lot but she is one of those pink-haired “my vagina has a VOICE!” types who virtue signals constantly about everything, and she was like that before.</p>
<p>All the scaremongering from the government and media seems to be losing its effect on people, despite this “delta variant”. Just my observation. Feel free to share yours.</p>
<p>Edit: for clarification I was referring more to the average person, not specifically people in this sub.</p></p>

        <p>The only thing I fear is vaccine rape. Being forced to get this. Being prevented from working or buying food or basically being alive unless I allow them to inoculate me. I am not afraid of anything else at all.</p>

        <p>Yes I’d rather get COVID, I work in healthcare and have had lots of shots and I have NEVER felt so strongly against anything ever in my life. My gut is telling me DO NOT DO THIS. I cannot ignore that feeling it is overwhelming. Again, I am not an anti vaxer and anyone who calls me this and tries to shame me is an uneducated disgusting piece of shit . I have a friend whose sister gives the vaccine and he is going to ask her if she will dump the syringe and record him as inoculated. If she is willing to do this I am prepared to pay a hefty sum for this. I will do anything to avoid this. I am absolutely 1000 percent certain I would have a bad reaction considering my reaction to other things in the past, and when I say bad reaction I mean far more than a rash and body aches.</p>

        <p>Hay great to see a fellow healthcare worker here. Please dont fake getting the "vaccine." We need to fight tyranny together, not work with it. I'm prepared to take my workplace to court over this and even lose my job if freedom loses out in court. I also am not an antivaxxer. I think vaccines are a scientific miracle but these drugs for covid are not vaccines even though they changed the definition of vaccine. Also of the residence in the facility that I work at zero have died of covid but several have died of the covid "vaccine."</p>

        <p>Hello! It's funny you say this because I have been a hypocrit telling a few others not to to this for the exact reason you say... My worry is I am in nyc, have no family, I am middle aged and alone with no one to lean on and if I am suddenly in a position where my livlihood is threatened and I cannot find a new job fast I may have to scramble to survive for the time being. I completely agree with you though, I am now looking at job listings to see what's out there if it comes to this. I never thought I'd feel this unstable at my age it is so scary.</p>
<p>Did you watch the Brett weinstein interview with Dr Robert Malone? So interesting!</p>

        <p>That's what's so great about working in the medical field. We are in such high demand we can get a new job in a heartbeat. I plan on leaving this state if I lose my job, will probably have to considering how authoritarian Washington state is. I'm surprised any non-sheep still live in nyc. You are in a great position to pick up and move since you don't have any family to support. </p>
<p>I haven't watched that interview yet but I'll look it up, thank you.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for the encouragement! We are both in gulag states it's seems, I hope you get to a better place too! Being a non sheep in nyc is the most debilitating thing I have ever experienced. I constantly feel like I am staff in a psych hospital and I am surrounded with patients, which I have been at one of my first jobs years ago lol</p>

        <p>I have been considering leaving this state for about two years now, even more so since the covid insanity started. But if I lose my job over refusing to be a lab rat than that will be the final straw. I will miss being so close to family but I have to consider my health first. I would move to Idaho so I will at least be close enough to drive over and visit. I dont even feel safe here anymore, I'm even hearing cop cars fly past my neighborhood several times a week when I use to hear them just once or twice a month.</p>

        <p>I think we are going through similar experiences! I live in a safe neighborhood, I’ve lived here for years. Well I should actually say it used to be safe. I actually heard gunshots tonight. The gun violence and assault have skyrocketed. I wanted to go to the store for a diet peach Snapple and I had to make the decision not to because I realized it wouldn’t be worth my life. I was born here, I’ve lived here during some pretty dark times and never in my entire life have I felt as unsafe and anxiety ridden as I do now. I just heard something about what’s coming next as far as the climate lock down they have planned for us. I don’t think I’m going to make it through that living in this city. They are going to further restrict our movement, there’s no way in hell I can stay locked up in the small apartment again for another year. This is absolutely inhumane and cruel treatment they are inflicting on us and I’m just done! Idaho sounds great I’ve heard good things about it, there’s really nothing close to where I live that is normal without draconian rules. I have no idea where I would even go, I can’t live someplace with hot weather though that’s one of my deal breakers I hate heat! I guess we’ll see, maybe this could be a good thing for the both of us, we have to look at the positives. Maybe we will meet people we are supposed to meet and do things we are supposed to do and we never would have experienced them if it hadn’t been for this dystopian world we are living in!</p>

        <p>I will be a couple hour drive from being able to visit my parents but at least I would be that much further from the daily riots of Portland Oregon. I live about a half hour from Portland and I see news stories about people who hold the same political views as me being hunted down and even killed. At work some of the clients I care for were joking and happy when Rush Limbaugh died. I dont hold all of the same views as him but many of them I do. After that all I could think about was, "If they knew my views would they be happy if I died?" That thought haunted me and it scares me that a large portion of the people around me feel the same way as them.</p>

        <p>Out of literally everything that's been going on in this pandemic, this is the one thing that I'd call a "smoking gun" and it has me extremely worried. I've seen fringe scientists/doctors get censored in the past for pushing misinformation (which you can argue about the validity of that) but this is the first time I've ever seen legitimate, unquestionable experts get shut down without even so much as an excuse.</p>
<p>It is undeniably the case now that there is an official "narrative" with this thing, and deviation from it is not allowed... under those circumstances, there's absolutely no way any legitimate science can be done, which means that what they're telling us is <em>highly suspect</em>.</p>
<p>What's weird is that I was actually kind of on the fence about all the conspiracy theories until they started censoring Bret and his guests. I'm still puzzled about why they'd so obviously show their hand like this, except maybe as a warning to any other doctor who might think about speaking out... that's a scary thought.</p>

        <p>If you take it to court the precedent must be set by somebody sooner rather than later. I think you have Nuremberg code 1947 on your side. Im a former fedex ground driver &amp; half the people in the building didn't wear masks. Security always talked about the place getting fined but fedex wouldn't have a delivery operation if those people got rid of every last noncomplier. I wore a mask in the building <em>only once.</em> During my last random drug test. boss didn't care one bit about me saying fuck that mask. The fedex officials know they have no right to give any orders to the drivers.</p>

        <p>I know the law is on the side of people not wanting to be experimented on but law has gone completely out the window over covid. Even our American constitution has been torn to shreds over this, freedom of assembly and freedom of religion are just gone. Many major cities all across the country have descended into lawlessness. Peoples businesses are being shut down then the owners are put in jail when they try to open again because they are desperate to earn a living.</p>

        <p>One cannot disagree with this. Every catastrophe is about money &amp; power. 9/11 made government richer via oil grabs &amp; defense contractors richer via weapons purchases. This new conspiracy is about instituting martial law on the people &amp; fattening big pharmas pockets. I had a kids party business idea but the law came &amp; stopped me for 1.5 year. Worst part is everybody is afraid of their kids getting the virus but kids don't die from it. The risk is too minimal. The government did indeed say fuck the constitution &amp; the bill of rights. The effect on the first amendment takes all my faith in the government down to zero. Vaccine requirements make the U.S. look like nazi germany.</p>

<p>My frustration is that I'm not necessarily against getting a COVID vaccine in the future. But I'm not comfortable with all of this ridiculous hype. I hate the fact that people demand that I do it now.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I didn’t have nearly as much anxiety till the vaccine roll out, I’m terrified for my small kids who are becoming school aged (problematic if this becomes mandatory). And my partner and pediatrician see absolutely no issue vaccinating the kids as soon as it’s possible. 2021 is depressing in a way that 2020 wasn’t. And the real isolation is not being able to discuss my fears with anyone who I actually talk to (friends/family), everyone thinks I’m irresponsible for not wanting the shot. But it’s so far beyond me, when I think about the kids, my heart just breaks.</p>

        <p>OMG I am so sorry my heart breaks for you, I would lose my mind if I was dealing with protecting small children. This is really the most horrifying thing I've ever witnessed. I pray that you are able to find a solution and hopefully someone IRL to talk to. In the meantime you have here, you are not alone in your feelings 🙏</p>

        <p>Thanks, I’m just hoping that by the time it gets to toddlers, some rational minds will step in and look at the data and decide it’s not worth it for kids, and we just drop it. Or I will be collecting a strong body of evidence against this for my kids to convince their dad… Trying not to dwell on it and live our lives  the best way we can by going outside, getting lots of play time, and eating nutritious foods, it’s really all I can do right now.</p>

        <p>I also have preschoolers but we are committing to homeschooling. I quit my job to stay home while their daddy works.</p>
<p>Please check out www.hlsda.org</p>
<p>They have a wealth of info on how to homeschool, it is easier than you think, especially for prek. Only really need an hour a day of focused work and the rest is just what you would normally do: read stories, paint, draw, sing songs, nursery rhymes, etc.</p>
<p>It is so worth it, and on the same website you can look up local homeschool groups in your state. That way you can get together with like minded people, and tackle the all too frequently mentioned 'socialization problem'. </p>
<p>I'm in Oregon, so even though practically everywhere is still closed if you refuse to mask up, I have been able to keep my kids relatively fine hanging out with kids of all ages.</p>

        <p>Yes they have destroyed our lives. I just hope husband and I don't suffer too much at this point. Probably when the food, medicine and power goes off, I won't be long for the world. I need power to even stay alive--CPAP, nebulized medicine etc. </p>
<p>We have known deprivation in our past. Don't take the mark of the beast willingly. I plan to hide, I know they could catch me and force it on me too and hope God or the divine understands.</p>

        <p>In Dec 19/Jan 20 when the (faked) China photos were spammed all over the internet I was concerned. But very quickly I caught our own government using fear, lies, exaggerated numbers, altering how tests are done and deaths were counted, and censoring credible dissent from medical workers, doctors, and scientists all over the world.</p>
<p>Ever since then I've been scared of our government, Big Tech, Big Pharma, WEF/WHO/WB/Gates foundation and the vaccines.</p>
<p>Not the virus.</p>

        <p>I didn’t give a shit when I first heard about it because I figured it would be like every other bird/swine/whatever flu they always scaremonger about that ends up being a nothing burger. I didn’t even care when I heard it was in the US.</p>
<p>It was after things started shutting down that I started freaking out. I’ll admit at that point I became terrified of the virus during late March and early April because the lockdown was so unprecedented, I guess I naively thought “there’s no way they would do this unless it was really as deadly as they say.”</p>
<p>But I got redpilled fast. I flew out of state literally the day the stay at home order was lifted.</p>

        <p>Some skeptics even pointed out how the definition of all these phrases in 2008 would've made this virus go away within 2-3 months but because the definitions of these phrases were changed to make accomplishing the goals even harder, we are now stuck in a fucking game of limbo.</p>

        <p>Isn't it odd how this virus was so deadly and contagious that the workers trying to contain it at the epicenter were wearing full hazmat suits, but after a while a simple mask combined with not standing too close to one another sufficed instead?</p>

        <p>I don’t think the few people (at least where I live) who still wear masks are necessarily afraid of the virus. </p>
<p>I suspect lot of people wear them because they’re either virtue signaling, insecure about their appearance or have social anxiety. I’m definitely not advocating for masks, but I don’t think it’s about the virus anymore in many cases. You will see a lot of comments confirming this on mainstream Reddit threads about masks.</p>

        <p>You’re not wrong, except for if they’re doing it <em>just</em> to virtue signal. A lot of those people are just smug assholes who feel the need to show off to the world what a selfless, morally superior person they think they are.</p>
<p>…which, to be fair, might also be fear based deep down, if you want to get into the psychology behind it. But I think it has more to do with political tribalism and a misplaced sense of anger, i.e. those stupid posts like “I’m going to keep wearing my mask so no one thinks I’m a Trump supporter!”</p>

        <p>Anyone who obeys is afraid. Fear is the enemy of freedom. The sheep will cause the erosion of all rights and liberties of everyone, including those of us who are awake. This is a guarantee. Just remember that fact in 2 months when you are asked to produce a "vaccine passport" to buy groceries. You will know who is responsible for this tyranny. The only thing keeping this scamdemic together is fear. Without fear, the government has zero control.</p>

        <p>Sorry you got downvoted, I assume it’s because you said you voted for Biden. I get it, I worked for Obamas campaign in college and even voted for Hillary (puke… I had to metaphorically hold my nose while doing it and I honestly regret it, but I fell for the propaganda and thought Trump would be worse.) </p>

<p>The real pandemic is one of corruption &amp; fear. We the commoners lose our jobs &amp; are disallowed to run/start a business due to this martial law while the government/corporate leaders rake in ever-rising revenues. The government touches whatever agency &amp; it all turns to shit. Real science goes out the window &amp; real scientists get canned no matter what the method. </p>

<p>It was clear very early on the demographics that were and weren't at risk. What I saw with my friends and family was inline with that data. The statistics have only changed very little from the beginning, but they're generally the same.</p>

        <p>I have a coworker who is still genuinely afraid of it. Still wears the mask and talks about how dangerous it is. The weird part is we’ve been working in person all year. But he’s not crazy in the way the people screaming at non maskers are, still talks to everyone like we’re human, he’s just very afraid of the virus lol. He watches the news a lot. We’re also in one of the bluest parts of California so there’s that.</p>

        <p>Since I haven't had it yet, I'm probably still as afraid of catching it as I was from the beginning - I know there's a chance it could be very bad, so I'm not at all blasé about it - but I also decided very early that I wasn't willing to spend the rest of my life hiding from it</p>

        <p>Yes! As a Michigander our mandates were finally lifted just yesterday! (not that I was complying anyway ha, just nice to walk in somewhere w/o a mask and not get the stink eye). But I am real nervous about what could happen this fall/winter when flu/"something else to be scared of" season rolls around and if they'd try to lockdown again (in which case the hubs and I will be heading to FL or TX).</p>

        <p>My grandmother in law is too. She was the first in line in my relatives to offer up her arm. Early 2020 I came down with an odd flu like illness, and it only lasted three days. I don’t know if I had COVID or some random bug, but what I do know is it wasn’t that bad. The fever sucked, and I felt drained but I’m fine. I’ve had a seasonal flu that was far worse. Just my two cents. Have a great day.</p>

        <p>In my very blue part of my blue state I see posts on the local Facebook page with people who are still terrified of it. Most of them have been vaccinated and tRuSt ThE sCiEnCe so they have transferred their fear onto their children. They're 100% convinced their  kids will get covid and die if anyone takes their mask off or looks at them at the grocery store. No one I personally know is although I did hear my neighbor, who has straight up had her children locked in the house the better part of this, tell her kids at the playground that they could play but to stay back from everyone. A kid came near them and her daughter jumped back with a terrified look on her face. It was really sad.</p>

        <p>Yes, I'm absolutely petrified. Shaking in my boots. Covid could be on the door handle to my room, so I haven't left on days, I've been living off protein bars (that I rinse in sanitizer just in case) and wearing my mask 24/7 even though I've also sealed off the windows (don't want a passing jogger to cough in the wind, thus giving me a death sentence.) My parents tried to come into my room (both double vaxed, like me) and I freaked out and yelled at them. </p>

        <p>I hear you. I’ve tried three times this year to arrange a visit with my close family members, but they are too scared. They got their second dose recently and were advised by the doctor to wait three weeks before they see anyone. They know my stance on everything, but asked me again a few days ago if I was willing to get the jab. My viewpoint hasn’t changed. And neither has theirs. It’s really like speaking a different language - facts and data are out of the question, or they go in one ear and out the other - unless it comes from the TV. I’m worried they will choose not to see me again without conditions. Fingers crossed, will see how it goes. Good luck to you as well.</p>

<p>Ugh! That's the absolute worst part! They're literally being mind controlled by the "experts" on the tell-a-vision. Nothing I say or show gets through to them since I'm not one of the "smart" people on the magic box!</p>

        <p>Lol, yes, exactly. It’s like everyone around you out in the “real” world has been zombified and sometimes you just want to scream and shake them “Wake up!” - but they just keep staring at you glossy-eyed. Then you get the angry reactions sometimes too. That one usually throw me for a loop. And yes, they are most certainly always “smarter” than you, aren’t they? Lol. If the message doesn’t have the state-sponsored stamp of approval, it’s not “trustworthy.” Facts and data? Who needs it! Talk about living in the matrix.. I joke, but of course it cuts much deeper and can be painful to deal with when it’s your own family. But thank God for this sub, it has helped me to know I’m not alone and I can blow off steam with bad jokes. It’s crazy out there! Literally.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of people have already had Covid and don't even know it.  A couple of data points:</p>
<p>There is a UCLA study that suggests that the official timeline is off and that it was circulating in Los Angeles in Dec 2019.  <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/covid-19-may-have-been-los-angeles-early-last-december-ucla-led-study-suggests">link</a>  Back then nobody knew what Covid was and nobody was testing for it, so if you had a flu that kicked your ass around that time (like I and many people I know did), that may well have been Covid.  (Just to clarify "kicked my ass" means being in bed for a couple days, not "he ded".)</p>
<p>Second, there was a study back in March 2021 where the Red Cross checked blood donations <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/15/health/red-cross-blood-donations-covid-antibodies/index.html">and found that</a> 20% of unvaccinated people had Covid antibodies, suggesting they were exposed at some point.  This was across 44 states.  Blood donors aren't exactly a randiom sample, but if that suggests there are tens of millions of people who already were exposed to Covid and have some protection despite being unvaccinated.</p>
<p>To answer the question, I worried about some of my much older relatives, one of which who did die (of a heart attack), but never myself or immediate family.</p>

        <p>Yup, that's me. Late February, 2020. I even went to my doctor, so there's a record of me having some kind of illness at the start of the pandemic in my medical chart. Like you said, my doctor didn't diagnose me with COVID because even doctors didn't know about it yet. Well, there is one specific doctor who knew about it, who shall not be named.</p>
<p>Basically, she prescribed me a Z-pack, told me to rest &amp; drink plenty of fluids for 3 days and get your ass back to work. OK, I'm being sarcastic about the work part, but even if she had said that, I would not be offended or upset about it at all because that's about how severe it was. </p>
<p>Now that I think about it, since there is a clinical record of me seeing my doctor at the beginning of the pandemic, I wonder if that can be used as evidence I had COVID. Probably not, since I wasn't officially diagnosed with it. Wishful thinking, I guess...</p>

        <p>Yes. And i cant deal with it or believe it. I deliver with doordash. They wont even come to their doors which i attribute most of that to be shame from not tipping, lazy, mannerless, old or unable too. But there are a few that make it clear in the notes they want no contact due to covid. There are some that have a shit fit if they come to the door and im delivering without a mask (they have their mask on and look horrified at the sight of me) or they will stand behind their screen door and tell me "just drop it there"</p>

        <p>They should be embarrassed if they don’t tip. I’ve always been of the mindset that if you can’t afford to or don’t want to tip at least 15 - 20%, you shouldn’t use a service.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Once me and my 3 children hit hard times BAD. The worst time of our lives...we had to live in an extended stay hotel for 4 months. It was so shitty and overpriced. Never thought id make it out of that situation
Anyway long story short the first 2 months of it i was carless. It was to hot to walk for food with my infant. I ordered doordash
.already overpriced of course...and i couldnt bring myself to not leave a decent tip, even though i really didnt have it to spare...and still met them outside to say thank you</p>
<p>Idk maybe i just am to big on manners and decency but to me, if able to (im sure some people may be elderly or handicapt) someone should want to come to the door to tell their delivery worker thank you also. Im kinda a hermit not social so i dont mind the leave at door but i know id find myseld uncomfortable to not smile and say thank u if im ordering</p>

        <p>There are still many, many who stubbornly cling to their fear. They are certain that Fauci is being persecuted by right wing extremists and that they will be vindicated in the end. I’ve got a couple of close friends that are liberals and work in the tech field and swore me to secrecy before they told me that they voted for Trump but would NEVER admit it to their co-workers as it would be professional suicide but this is their other friends beliefs</p>

        <p>I had Covid personally and it barely did anything uncomfortable to me. I'm more afraid of the fact that most doctors can't prescribe the treatments that are proven to work! My mom nearly died from COVID but when I talked to her I was shocked that her doctor was recommending that she not take ANY vitamin D. I was so disgusted. Thankfully she was able to fight it off. She got the vaccine. She won't listen to me when I talk to her about alternative options-because of her doctor.</p>

        <p>Yes, there are definitely people still scared. I live in Alabama in very small very conservative town. Not a single local is wearing a mask. Most never did to begin with. When I go to either Birmingham or Tuscaloosa, people there will move as far away from as possible when they see I'm not wearing a mask. The media has given these people PTSD.</p>

        <p>As someone living in MI and on the edge of a "blue" area (not to be political, I've just noticed a difference in blue vs red areas when it comes to mandate compliance), I've seen these people. Up until our mandates being lifted yesterday, seeing people wear masks while walking outside alone or driving in cars alone was (sadly) still a regular occurrence. I've also seen people post on fb saying that they plan to continue wearing one even w/o the mandates. I think some people may never take them off.</p>

        <p>I saw a bunch in the park this morning when I was walking my dog. They weren't wearing masks yesterday, but today they were back with their stupid face nappies. I asked one of them why, since I happen to know they're all vaccinated (they have previously announced this absurd fact with great pride). They told me they were now masking up because of the deadly Felching, er, I mean Delta Variant.</p>

        <p>Part of me is but I don’t know how much of that is already my germphobia or what the media and society has ingrained into me. Part of me wants to believe the vaccine is safe and will protect me but there’s so much going on I don’t know what to think so I just go about my daily life.</p>

        <p>I’m reasonably concerned about taking pointless risks, and catching/ spreading it out of carelessness.</p>
<p>As such I’m not staying within less than 3 feet of  random strangers or acquaintances that are showing symptoms for more than a minute. If I feel sick I’ll either stay home or wear a mask, and I’ll avoid environments that tend to make transmission more likely. </p>
<p>On the other hand, these are all common sense things I’d be doing normally especially in flu season.</p>

        <p>Never was. In early 2020 i was more curious than scared, but even back then, when very little was known about the virus, it was glaringly obvious the hysteria was disproportionate to the threat. As early as March 2020 it was known that the average age of those who died was 82.
What I am scared though is the UK turning into a one party totalitarian police state, mandatory vaccination and mandatory vaxx IDs that will undoubtedly morph into something bigger, as well as absolutely horrified at how many people are  braindead.</p>

        <p>My friend tested positive for COVID-19 on the day we spent together at the beach. Both she and her partner were positive -- he has received the vaxx, she has not and she's pregnant. I felt perfectly fine everyday. Ten days later, I went to visit my grandma in LTC and was tested -- negative, as I expected. It's an anecdote, but I'm happy about my results. It's a virus. Everything else is chaos.</p>

        <p>I don’t know man. I’m severely depressed (due to non plandemic reasons) and while I managed to rationalize a lot of what’s going on I’m in contact with a lot of family that is either old or has certain health issues. I could get Ebola for all I care and I’m certain they overplayed their hand with COVID but I’m just imagining if I <em>was</em> wrong, if there’s a slight chance I could fuck them over... couldn’t live with myself. So I’m taking a few extra precautions. </p>
<p>What really worries me is what are they gonna do next. Not only they exhausted people throughly they drilled nonsensical biosecurity ideas into people. If (or when) the next pandemic strikes, if it’s a real, deadly virus, it will chew through waves of dimwits wearing face socks and staying 6 feet away from people bleeding from their every hole.</p>

        <p>it's at the point where I don't think it can even be argued any more that the people who remain scared even have their own agency. As far as I can tell, the only existing cause of COVID fear is the substitution of one's own inner faculties with completely different faculties that come from outside the person.</p>

        <p>I wasn't afraid of it because I have MMS at home (miracle mineral supplement) and that shit has worked for me in the past to knock out colds, flus, and infections immediately. I discovered it back in 2008 before it went mainstream and the CDC started shitting on it like HCQ and Ivermectin.</p>
<p>If the elites really wanted to depopulate with the jab, then they dropped the ball by not bringing it sooner at the height of everyone's fear. Then again, people might have been really skeptical if it were rushed out sooner than it already was.</p>

I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can lock you down in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in virology, but I have access to the entire list of corona variants in the Wuhan institute of virology laboratory and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy deboonking your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn antimasker idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in hand sanitizer. You're probably already a fucking CDC statistic, kiddo.</p>

        <p>One of my best friends has a friend down by where she lives and her parents are batshit crazy about this. We’re in Texas btw. They went to Austin for the weekend and when they got back her parents said she had to quarantine for 2 weeks with my friend. So she hung out with her for 2 weeks before she went home. They still went around town and doing all sorts of things that definitely aren’t following covid guidelines. Her parents wouldn’t let them hang out at all until they got their vaccines. They were getting them anyway, but like damn.</p>

        <p>I am legitimately scared of dying to covid over the next 14 days.  I do not have access to covid drugs.  I do not have access to anything other than being put on a bus and sent to the state covid camps.  Here in my home I have every amenities but I do not have something for this “hard breathing”.  I got my PCR tests results back on June 16... and now I’m just waiting to live though I think the chance of death my be equal.  Fuck covid.  If I could just get the fuck out of this nation I’d be 100% fine...... this is bs</p>

        <p>Don't get mad., I still am a little bit, bad lungs and severe disabilities friend had sister end up almost dying of it in hospital. I think they released something though PCR cooked it up. I am far more afraid of the totalitarianism and the Covid vaxx. I am afraid of societal collapse, and losing people. I am afraid of severe poverty [unemployment ends in Sept] to come worse then what I had in my youth and then I was near homeless living in squalor and having to eat out of trashcans [dumpster diving] and slept on a mattress out of the trash too.  I can see disability checks vaporizing. Found out yesterday husband needs a minor medical procedure that is probably going to clean out what little savings we have because there's no health insurance for him. I fear the Fema camp or being held down and forced to take the "mark of the beast" but figure if that happens the divine/God would understand.  I fear the sick sad world they are creating. I am severely disabled too and there are fears with that. The culling is aimed right at me.</p>

        <p>I’m from New Jersey and it’s insane how much things have changed in my part of the state in only really like 4-5 weeks. A month or 2 ago right after the CDC announcement you were looked at weird if you weren’t wearing a mask alone in the car by yourself, but now I haven’t worn a mask in almost 3 weeks, and the people with masks on are looked at as the weirdos. Still have a lot of work to do but it feels great man. People are actually being people again</p>

        <p>I fear "Covid" because of the power people have decided it grants the government, not because of the disease itself.</p>
<p>I hate the argument "I had Covid, it was awful!" Well no shit, have you ever been sick with anything and been like "damn can I do that again?" At no point the last time I had the flu and was on the ground in my bathroom because the cold tile floor felt good did I ever think "man I could do this again." Do you know what I told people when I got better and they asked if I was ok? "I'm fine, but man was it awful."</p>
<p>It's called being fucking sick, and yes it sucks. The fact that being sick isn't fun doesn't justify burning the constitution to avoid doing it a second time.</p>

        <p>Yes. Winter in South Africa at the moment and my family is freaking out. “So many people are dying.” 🙄 even my sister’s very obese friends have been begging people to wear masks and keep everyone safe cause they fear for the health 🤷🏻‍♀️ it does not matter how many times I try and tell them and show them they all still live in fear, and fear is what is going to kill them.</p>

        <p>Honestly the only people still worried about it are those who can not get the vaccine and want it.    Some people have reasons why they can't get the vaccine but most of us already have had it so we don't care if you are vaccinated or not... we also could not care less  if you wear masks.    I do feel sorry for little kids, old people, immune compromised people,  cancer patients,  etc who can't get the vaccine because they are still at risk.    But no one cares even a little bit about anti vaxers and honestly I'm hoping as soon as everyone who wants the vaccine has it that they will drop the regulations 100% because we are ALL tired of you complaining.    I am even to the point where I don't care if you get the virus and kill a couple of babies, old people or cancer patients.   We all (the entire world) just want you to shut up.    The one thing I will say is that I want any and all virus related government assistance and medical care to be suspended for anyone who refused to get the vaccine.   I don't want to pay your medical bills or unemployment or any assistance at all if you get sick.     We don't care about your plight (because apparently you were the only ones affected by this shit over the past 18 months) and we don't care about you.    Don't get vaccinated... no one cares.    But if you do get sick do not ask the government for any of my tax dollars.    As long as you are willing to pay for the potential consequences of your choices then we are good.</p>

        <p>If they had taken appropriate measures to prevent themselves getting sick (like getting vaxed and not taking unnecessary risks) then yes.    I would personally not have an issue with giving any assistance needed to anyone who was unable to get vaxed when they desired the vaccine but were prevented from getting it (like a cancer patient who cannot receive the vaccine).   My only issue is with people who made the choice (as is their right) to abstain from the vaccine asking for special treatment or exceptions if they became ill.   </p>
<p>My argument for this is that there are consequences and risks to both choices (getting or not getting the vaccine) all vaccinated people accepted the risks of the vaccine knowing that it was developed and released without the typical years of clinical trials.    We did this to hasten economic recovery and a return to normal with fewer risks to vulnerable people.    You and other anti vax people have also knowingly entered into a decision that has certain risks and consequences.    Everyone accepts your right to make that choice but would expect you to accept the consequences of that choice the same as we have.    </p>
<p>I believe this is fair but would be interested in a rebuttal if you have one to offer.    I believe in a free society everyone should be able to make informed choices for themselves.   However we have both rights and responsibilities as members of a society and have to accept any consequences our choices have.  We should not expect others to accept responsibility for our choices if they do not work out the way we thought they would.    If the vaccine causes me to turn green or grow a second head /s I wouldn't expect you to pay for the plastic surgery to fix me.   Lol</p>

        <p>My comment would simply be that someone who has been vaccinated in the circumstances that you described has made an informed choice, whereas you assume that people who don't want to get vaccinated haven't made an informed choice. I would assert that there is no difference between the two, and it's wrong to support one decision and example of freedom of choice, while castigating the other.</p>

        <p>I would argue that it does, for example, SARS has a lethality of \~15%, but that's not what all us reasonable people are trying to protect each other from, because it only has an RO of .19-1.08 so it would probably eventually kill itself off, and if not, it would still only be a one to one thing</p>

        <p>I wasn’t arguing the definition, but that it does have to do with how dangerous an infection is, as I said in my SARS example, a disease with a high fatality and low R0 is much less scary then a disease with a high R0 and a smaller, though still sizeable fatality</p>

        <p>Fortunately when they engineered cov2, it ended up being far more transmissible but far less lethal. </p>
<p>Whether that was a fluke or not I don’t know, but if you haven’t had covid and you have had the vaccine, be weary of severity if you do catch it in the future.</p>

        <p>Dude. The world wide case amount is 180,477,133 at time of writing, and the deaths are 3,909,661. Now, unless I’m a dumbass like you say I am, you divide 3,909,661 by 180,477,133 and multiply the result by 100, you get the percentage. That percentage is 2.16 with many digits after, so yes, I am a dumbass, I rounded down when I should have rounded up, 2.2%
