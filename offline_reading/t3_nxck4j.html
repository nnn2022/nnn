    <strong>One-Third Of New Drugs Had Safety Problems After FDA Approval</strong>
    <p><p>I've posted these articles and similar over the last few days, and someone suggestion to make a post.</p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/09/527575055/one-third-of-new-drugs-had-safety-problems-after-fda-approval
https://www.healthline.com/health-news/drugs-have-problems-after-they-get-approved
https://www.sciencealert.com/nearly-1-in-3-drugs-have-safety-issues-even-after-fda-approval</p>
<p>The TL;DR is that in 2017, they studied all new drugs developed between 2001-2010 and found that there were safety concerns found once the drugs had been through clinical trials and been signed off on by the FDA.  The median amount of time to find these issues was 4.2 years.  They also found that one of the reasons why these issues were not caught in clinical trials was the speed that the drugs were approved.  </p>
<p>To apply this to the current situation:  People will come in here and say that mRNA has been studied for over 30 years.  That is correct.  But the concern people have here in /r/nonewnormal is that it wasn't until very recently that these treatments and vaccines have made it to clinical trials or made available to the general public under EUA.  You can make the claim that they are safe, but history would indicate that there's a good chance issues will be found once you administer 100million shots and wait a few years.</p>
<p>Additionally, people are looking at the risk factors of COVID:  most people that die from COVID are old and have issues that would make them more likely do them in than someone who is young and healthy.  Additionally, the risk factor in children is no worse than the flu, but they would have to live with any severe reaction from a vaccine (not saying this will happen or is likely).  There are others, like myself, who are low risk to even catch COVID but have had severe reactions to a vaccine in the past and would rather not get it to may or may not have another severe reaction.  In other words, right now the consequences of COVID may not be worth to some people because there was a lot we don't know.  When we know more, more and more people will likely get it.  On the other hand, if COVID had even a 10% or even 5% death rate more people would be willing to get the vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>I have to point out that usually comes from being used with other drugs they were not tested with and the doctors finding out "Oh yeah, these two drugs interact... let's not use them together!"</p>

        <p>Correct, and that's a good point.</p>
<p>But I think this still falls under the point I'm making.  It's literally impossible to test every single combination of drug/co-morbidity/etc. and then track them for 10 years.  It's essentially risk analysis with the clinical trials, they've tested a representative group of people for long enough that they think it's going to be safe. There has to be some cut off.</p>

        <p>This is why having the covid jab go through the normal approval process is the LEAST we can do.</p>
<p>Shoving it out the door, offering lottery tickets, schools making it mandatory, and demonizing people who make their own decision not to get it is fucking insanity.</p>
