    <strong>Question</strong>
    <p><p>Note: this is not meant to be mean or a joke post</p>
<p>Hi, I have browsed this sub-Reddit and was left with a question that doesn’t seemed to be answered. I’m all for masks, social distancing, stay at home orders, etc... Because as someone who has had multiple people I know to be infected and hospitalized, I just understand the importance. However, I am someone who doesn’t see things as black and white. I’m very open-minded and will see things from different perspectives. I genuinely want to know 1. What is the damage with wearing a mask? 2. Is it a political stance or an actual concern for public health? 3. Do you seriously feel like wearing a mask is an impediment to your freedom or that it makes you a SLAVE? 4. Why stop people from protecting themselves? </p>
<p>As someone who has multiple health conditions, seeing how people with COVID-19 will purposefully cough in someone’s face is really sickening. Also, my grandma has multiple lung problems but still is able to wear a mask in the heat. So, I genuinely wanna know. Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>People can wear whatever they like. The problem is there is no real science behind this. The only real way to stop the spread it to wash your damn hands. Masks are now being touted as the cure all for the disease when in fact there is scant evidence to prove it. It’s mainly passed through surfaces via dirty hands. If anything we should wear googles to stop us from touching our eyes. </p>
<p>Wearing a mask, touching something, then rubbing you eye is worse than going mask free. </p>
<p>People who have medical conditions should isolate themselves. There is no reason to impose this or any social distancing as it’s clearly not working. Countries and states that claim to have squashed it are not seeing resurgences despite all this. </p>
<p>The mask is a easily visible way to check who is complying and who is not. It creates fear for no reason. Pre-covid, hospital staff did not wear routinely masks outside of the OR. If it wasn’t needed there, you can’t tell me it’s needed in target. </p>
<p>If you feel scared or have some condition you should stay home. Do not selfishly expect everyone to upend their life for you. That’s not anyone else’s problem. </p>
<p>And since Lord Fauci has proven he does not follow mask rules as far as I’m concerned I don’t have to either.</p>

<li>masks do little if anything to protect you from the virus also it's a slippery slope of us loosing more rights.</li>
<li>I'm not responsible for other peoples health. If they are so afraid of a virus where 99.95% of people recover from they can choose to wear a mask. It's not dangerous enough for me to warrant wearing one.</li>
<li>Yes this is a slippery slope where we are loosing rights for the illusion of safety. Look at how many people are jobless right now because the government forced places to close.</li>
<li>Nobody is doing such a thing. But I should be free to choose if i want to wear a mask or not</li>

        <p>Thanks for your respectful response. I will do the same!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It has been proven time and time again that masks do work. It doesn't provide 100% safety, but it does a pretty good job. Also, what rights do people automatically lose when putting on a mask? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don't know the long-term effects of this virus and even if 99.5% recovered perfectly fine, why not be cautious? Why weigh down the healthcare workers who see death around them each and every day?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are jobless because we couldn't follow the example led by other countries and implement a federal strategy. There are people in Europe who are now able to work because they acted fast. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are doing that. People are yelling at people who wear masks, calling them sheeple. There are people who will verbally abuse essential workers because the stores require masks, women are going into Targets to destroy the mask display. So, it definitely is happening and it's sad. I feel like nothing is a personal choice when it directly puts people in danger.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd love for the world to resume to ”normal” but I can't ignore the facts. I can't ignore that we are at 4,000,000+ cases and nobody in power seems to want to do anything to change that.</p>

        <p>What about the millions of children harmed by the lockdown. </p>
<p>https://www.unicef.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Unicef-UK-Children-In-Lockdown-Coronavirus-Impacts-Snapshot.pdf </p>
<p>That’s just the U.K.  </p>
<p>Also 3 is not true at all. People lost their jobs BECAUSE of following the example by locking down. And no, we’re not doing well in Europe. People are getting poorer and poorer.</p>

<li>No it hasn't dr's and health experts have continued to flip flop on this. The mask is only mildly effective if you have the virus. And most cases are not asymptomatic. As I stated masks are  a slippery slope to loosing rights. My business was shut down is an example of me loosing my rights. Over a weak virus most people recover from.</li>
<li>This virus has been around for awhile and it seems theres little to no long term effects. I am not responsible for healthcare workers ( or anybodies) health. The virus is not deadly enough to warrant me wearing a mask, So I will continue not to wear one.</li>
<li>No people are jobless because the government and media is panning this slightly more aggressive flu as the black plague.The at risk and elderly should have taken precautions and we should have never locked down in the first place.</li>
<li>People have legit been murdered for not wearing masks. You pro maskers are not the victims here.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should likely just go post in coronavirus you'd  get the responses you desire there</p>

        <p>I’m currently living off welfare, £405 a month, to pay for a whole house/bills and a dependent (my younger brother, we have no parents and he’s a student) as LOCKDOWN left me jobless. I’m not going to buy masks. You must be insane. Give me them for free. 
I’m also depressed and lonely enough as it is, without me having to go outside into a dystopian world where I can’t even see people’s emotions and have human connections. It fills me with such bad anxiety and distress. </p>
<p>Watch this and tell me we haven’t been being lied to this whole time about the role of masks https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PRa6t_e7dgI. Either then or now, people were lying. I believe mask mandates are for people to feel more comfortable outside shopping, rather than stop the spread. If you have COVID symptoms you should stay at home, not go out with a mask. </p>
<p>Don’t blame the antimaskers for their bad behavior. A war has been declared on them. They’re just fighting back.</p>
<p>If you don’t feel safe outside, stay at home. Don’t force others to act differently when you’re the one who’s afraid and the government are already supporting you to be home. Stay home.</p>

        <p>You're convinced that a ratty old piece of T-shirt material draped over your nose and mouth is going to save the world if we all pull together as a team.  </p>
<p>The University of California at Davis Medical Center recently published a report. They've determined that Social Distancing provides you with 90% protection from this virus. Wearing a mask gives you 65% protection.  That isn't cumulative.  You get 90% or you get 65%.  You don't combine masks and social distancing and magically get a 155% percent reduction in transmission.</p>
<p>Most of the people I see hiding behind masks are wearing them wrong... or they're wearing a worthless piece of crap.  It's not doing them a bit of good.  Add to that the fact that when people put on these worthless masks they get a false sense of security...  <em>"I'm wearing my mask... that fat old lady is wearing a mask... we're safe... Thank you Jesus!"</em>  So you let your guard down... The fat old lady lets her guard down.. the two of you stop <em>Social Distancing</em> and resume crowding the aisles of the grocery store... and everyone asks <em>"What happened?  Why is the fat old lady sick? She was wearing a mask...  Doesn't this virus know that masks save lives?"</em></p>
<p>I find it interesting that when I don't hide behind a mask to go to the hardware store, people automatically stay away from me.  I like that.  They're giving me 90% protection.  They also give me dirty looks... but I really don't care.  Stay away from me and we'll be fine.</p>

        <p>I don't want everyone to wear masks cause <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.14.095414v2">most people are found to be innately immune</a>, because <a href="https://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/pdf/10.5858/arpa.2020-0255-LE">asymptomatic very rarely spread the virus</a> and most big cities have reached herd immunity already, and the ones that haven't are slowing the proccess with masks.     <br>
I just can't ever accept the premise that everyone around me is infected and infectious. That's the root of many evils.   <br>
You can't trust everyone around you isn't a thief or a murderer, maybe let's be all handcuffed in public? It'll definitely avoid crimes.</p>
<p>Also you mention the running theme of "Europe are over it already c'mon". We're not. We're fucked and our economies are fucked for years and jobs won't be back in a long time and people are terrified of an invisible monster that isn't that dangerous for them.</p>
