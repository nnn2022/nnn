    <strong>Even if masks provided 100% protection, they would be harmful.</strong>
    <p><p>I gave masks the benefit of the doubt in the spring/summer of 2020. I have since changed my mind and see no scenario where it makes sense to wear them in public. Even if they provided 100% protection, I believe masks to be harmful.</p>
<p>Let's say masks provide 100% protection to both the wearer and others (perhaps non-masked individuals) in close proximity. This is perhaps the worst scenario. The immune system requires a consistent influx of both microbes and viruses to remain trained. Halting the exposure to microbes and viruses is extremely harmful in the long run and leaves you exposed to enormous risk in the future. </p>
<p>Without training, you will become susceptible to even weaker microbes that your immune system would have normally handled with ease. This is no different than laying in bed for a prolonged period of time. Walking up stairs, an activity that normally would not be a challenge, would all of a sudden become difficult. Your immune system would slowly degrade similarly not able to complete previous tasks.</p>
<p>This is particularly harmful to children who's immune systems do not have the training of adults and would leave them more vulnerable. Children have the most life to lose so it harms them the most.</p>
<p>There is no end game with 100% protection. Everyone would have to continue wearing masks indefinitely as immune systems would continue to weaken and respiratory viruses are unable to be eradicated.</p>
<p>This scenario also makes it more risky for the susceptible for longer periods of time since the healthy do not gain immunity. And unless people wear masks at home (the most likely place of transmission) there will be a breach and  the susceptible will get sick.</p>
<p>This scenario increases fear and anxiety. If you knew something offered 100% protection, any encounters with someone without a mask would trigger the fear response within you.</p>
<p>The fear and anxiety would only increase as your immune system weakened. This is a viscous cycle of more and more extreme measures until everyone just becomes bubble boy. So the scenario with 100% protection leaves you fragile physically to microbes/viruses and fragile mentally to being around others without a mask.</p>
<p>All this said, I don't think masks provide any protection. Microbes/viruses have evolved together with animals on earth for hundreds of millions of years, competing and strategizing with one another for survival. All mammals use breathing, spitting, coughing, and sneezing to expel dust and germs from their respiratory tracts. All of these mechanisms are impaired with a mask. So, if harmful bacteria or viruses do enter your mouth, it becomes much more difficult to expel them.</p>
<p>Masks are actually good at collecting bacteria as they are 100x larger than viruses. Humans never evolved to keep a warm moist environment of bacteria trapped in front of their face for an extended period of time, breathing it in deeply breath after breath. Normal breathing, coughing, etc... expels this bacteria away from you. Masks are competing with hundreds of millions of years of evolution, preventing you from completing the most simple task we have to expel germs. </p>
<p>Masks appeal to the brain, because like duh obviously, they put a barrier between you and the germ. But, there are many counterintuitive results in science.</p>
<p>Clogged arteries are filled with cholesterol, yet eating cholesterol does not clog your arteries. Overeating junk food, seed oils and refined carbohydrates along with elevated stress leads to metabolic disease and overall body dysfunction, which leads to poor arterial health. Cholesterol is there to repair the diseased arteries and is found at the scene of the crime. No different than seeing police at the scene of a crime and accusing them. Mother's breast milk is filled with cholesterol and your body will produce the required amounts with what it does not get from diet.</p>
<p>Another counterintuitive result - the war on drugs - how do we stop people from abusing drugs? Put them in jail! No. This exacerbates the problem. Removing all penalties for users and providing them resources to overcome drug addiction is what works.</p>
<p>Just like the wars on cholesterol and drugs have failed and been exposed as extremely harmful to society, so too will masks. There are many unintended consequences to mask usage.</p></p>

        <p>There's also the mental harm of mask wearing. Facial expressions are a key part of communication, especially for children.  They are extremely <strong>important</strong> to the social interaction of individuals. This mask bullshit taking is completely removing this aspect of communication in most social settings. THIS IS BLATANT MODIFICATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY. Nothing pisses me off more than the "it's just a mask" garbage.</p>

        <p>Yea, we are basically there now. Obesity and cleanliness are at all time highs. Both weaken the immune system. But there is some good news. Many people are aware of whats going on, so there is help out there if you know about it. There are more resources on probiotics, reducing consumption of seed oils and refined carbs, exercise, intermittent fasting, nutrient deficiencies such as Vitamin D or magnesium etc... </p>
<p>Essentially, we need a return to more ancestral living - not necessarily paleolithic, but a healthy mixture of germs and modern day care when needed.</p>

        <p>A fun story: struggled with stomach and digestion problems my whole life. Moved to mexico and ate a more natural diet; what most in america would consider "dirty food", from outdoor markets, small vendors, etc. Felt like crap for 1 month. Then after, all my stomach problems disappeared. </p>
<p>I literally believe it was because my stomach fauna was underdeveloped from eating oversanitized/processed foods my whole life in the US. As soon as my body got used to processing food directly from the earth, everything changed. A lot of Americans cannot eat the meat off a freshly slaughtered animal or drink milk fresh from a cow because it contains bacteria they are not accustomed to. </p>
<p>A small example. But think of the implications in relation to naturally occuring viruses. Making us into space-pod people who cannot exist as naturally functioning humans. And thinking that is "healthy"</p>

        <p>Yup, it takes time to adjust to the new microfauna in the gut. This happens anytime you add/remove food groups. For instance, even if you are not gluten intolerant, removing gluten for a few months and then adding it back in will lead to bloating and gas until your gut readjusts. </p>
<p>The good thing is that basically everyone can adjust given enough time. You just have to stick with it to make it through the transition. The initial discomfort of changing foods deters people from making the change permanently and incorrectly signals that "something is wrong". Nothing is wrong, just your body sorting itself out.</p>
<p>Its just like the first few weeks of working out after a long period of no exercise. Your body adjusts and muscle soreness drastically decreases.</p>
<p>I ate raw meat for several months straight. There was a small adjustment period and then everything functioned as normal again. I'm not some super human. I just allowed my body to do its thing.</p>

        <p>The approach you described, removing a potential irritant then reintroducing it, can also resolve existing intolerance. Someone can become intolerant to things either because of over exposure or general inflammation, and the body may need a break/low inflammation diet before it can adapt as you describe.</p>

        <p>That's interesting. I hadn't heard of this before. My nephew has severe nut allergies and was on a treatment plan that slowly introduced peanut proteins from extremely small dosages to 1-2 peanut m&amp;m's. He was progressing fairly well for 6 months or so but then started having reactions. The parents had to end the treatment.</p>
<p>I wonder if the consistent exposure reached some critical level that overwhelmed him. It makes sense to take intermittent breaks instead of regular dosages. Sort of like overtraining in athletes - even the world's best athletes have to take breaks from their regular programming to stay healthy.</p>

        <p>The training analogy is a really good one. What often happens is athletes overtrain with smaller things that themselves accumulate fatigue but are unlikely to cause injury, so it's not really obvious that they are doing too much, then they injure themselves doing a larger movement even if the programming for that was intelligent. </p>
<p>Similarly with a food allergy other causes of inflammation or stress on the system can be leaving your immune system on high alert and primed for an allergic reaction, even if those things do not cause obvious symptoms. It's definitely a complex field though and not everyone responds the same or can ever get to the point of tolerating the same degree of irritants as the average.</p>
