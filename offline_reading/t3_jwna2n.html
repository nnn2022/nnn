        <p>I don't put them on my kids, 4 and 7. The seven year-old broke her arm in May. I took her in, they set it. Went back six weeks later and it was looking good BUT... They tried to make it only one kid and one parent. I'm like, "I'm a single father. You want me to just leave the four year-old in the lobby?" So her October appointment to "check tissue regeneration" was supposed to be the same rules. I just canceled it. Tired of the bullshit. Her arm is fine.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing that. The 'one parent' rule for doctor appointments is cruel, harmful and asinine. A family member of mine has a baby who, after weathering an extended hospitalization during covid (of course not from covid) needs 24 hour medical care. Her situation is complicated and yet every doctor appointment is a fight to have both parents present. Witnessing their struggle in the medical system to advocate for the very survival of their child is what has spurred me to vehemently oppose coronavirus restrictions.
When the medical establishment and politicians demand we comply with social distancing, they are in fact demanding harm to our children.</p>

<p>That's all I've been feeling during this, the damage done to my kids. Eight months ago I was closing in on a full year of kicking single fatherhood in the seat. My daughter had perfect attendance and my son was still in preschool and we had sorted out his bed wetting. During this time it started up again, and both children have regressed behaviorally.</p>
<p>BUT... I have them at home with me and we're all together, and though it can get pretty crazy, it's a blessing.</p>
