        <p>Why dont you take time to actually understand the points and arguments we are making?</p>
<p>Masks simply dont work. All the evidence in the world shows they dont work.  They are dehumanizing and cause serious issues when forced to wear them extensively. </p>
<p>This isnt ego driven. This is driven by real science. Not political science.</p>

        <p>Except there’s no science stating stating that racism doesn’t exist. When the scientific studies state the evidence is shaky to statistically insignificant for the effectiveness of masks then we should not be mandating them. You’re welcome to wear one though.</p>

        <p>No one is scared of a mask. You’re just talking. </p>
<p>Since you said you know all of the talking points, please share a counter argument for why a mask is necessary in low impact regions? What about when the particle size isn’t compatible for effectiveness? </p>
<p>You seem to be the kind of person that raises alarm. If I’m not socially distanced at a bar with a friend, you don’t care if I actually get a cold. You care about if I’m compliant. That’s the difference.</p>

        <p>Depends what a low impact region is. Where I am from, the UK, masks should still be worn as you are only a few miles away from high impact regions.</p>
<p>Droplets can't pass through masks, the reason masks are there is not because they are a solution, but just a useful deterrent. You should still socially distance with one.</p>
<p>Also I don't see what you mean about "You don't care if I actually get a cold". The compliance is to protect others. Though if it is with a friend, at least you know them so if one of you do get infected then you know to self-isolate. You both mutually accept that risk, too.</p>
<p>But I am not willing to sit on a bus and not socially distance with a bunch of people who I do not know and cannot contact in case of infection. They could be infected and I would never know, unless if we both were using a contact tracing app.</p>

        <p>"MINOR" - The intrusion into the freedoms of citizens by governments for something like this is unprecedented.  Governments are literally playing amateur scientist with their populations, it's disgusting to somebody like me, a scientist and science educator (that was a science professor before government and institutional intrusions got pretty bad).  Many more lives have been possibly ruined because of poor decision making, mandates, and so-called "science" (which some is, some isn't, some quite flimsy and pushed as "science") being paraded like some trump card to fix things.  Many in charge are "winging it" using methods that are not nearly as reliable as people are claiming are (and media is propagandizing the general public with), you should be quite worried about this.</p>
<p>For example, where I live, Canada, they have just been walking all over our rights; this includes literally written down rights they are supposed to respect.  You can cite explicit parts of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms they are intruding on.  These are not minor, they're fundamental for a free society to function properly.</p>

        <p>I am not selfish. I've actually benefited tremendously from the lockdowns. </p>
<p>My university classes all have open book, online final exams, which are much easier than in-person ones. The industry I work in is booming so I was able to ditch my shitty job and get one that was a lot better (higher pay, better work environment). I prefer to have a small group of friends over to my house than a large gathering in a restaurant anyway. </p>
<p>I've benefited from lockdowns. Who has NOT benefited are the 130 million people who will starve due to the economic fallout; the people who will die of drug overdose, suicide, cancer, and heart problems, because they can't get proper medical treatment; the children who will die of OTHER infectious diseases because they will be behind on their vaccination schedules.</p>

        <p>Here's why I'm opposed to mask mandates:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Masks are dehumanizing and unfriendly. I am normally an extremely cheerful guy. I chit-chat with the cashier, the bus driver, and the waiter. Guess what, since masks have been required, I find myself cranky, irritable, and far more abrupt. The social science is clear that these minor interactions with strangers are actually surprisingly VERY important to our wellbeing, sense of purpose, and overall quality of life. I know that they are for me. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks don't work to stop the virus. The science up until now has been pretty clear. Intuitively, masks should work. In randomized controlled trials, they don't work to stop the spread of viruses. An N95 might work, but an ill fitting cloth face mask (the kind that most people are wearing) won't. The science that has come out since the pandemic about masks has not used randomized controlled trials. One study measured particles of spit. Of course they're going to find that a cloth face mask prevents that. But how do we know that that correlates to stopping actual virus spread? We don't. And based on the best available evidence from before the pandemic, it's likely that it doesn't. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks don't work #2. If mask mandates worked, we should see that they have stopped or slowed the spread of the virus (a) between jurisdictions that imposed one and jurisdictions that did not and (b) within jurisdictions over time, before and after mandate. We have not seen either of these correlated appropriately as we would expect if masks were effective. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is nothing more permanent than a temporary solution, especially when it comes to government actions. I have no issue with private businesses requiring masks. I simply won't shop there. With a mask mandate, that choice has now been removed. Businesses are able to respond more quickly. Governments are not known for quick action in changing policy based on new evidence. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making masks mandatory for asymptomatic people does very little to nothing to stop the virus, and could make things worse. WHO / CDC have said that asymptomatic spread, if it's occurring at all, is NOT the primary way that this virus is spreading. Making healthy people wear masks, then, does not prevent viral spread but DOES make it more likely that people will touch their face. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have no issue with voluntary social distancing. That's fine by me as long as government isn't imposing it. I don't find the store decals telling you to stand 6 feet apart to be dystopian, personally.</p>

        <p>I think it is common sense though that a mask will catch unintentional droplets which is doing something to slow the spread. My (The UK) government wouldn't have taken the decision to enforce mask wearing lightly. They hesitated, but came to the conclusion that they should do it, backed up by medical/science experts, etc. They are the experts, not me. I think there should be government enforced social distancing in a way, moreso that I don't want strangers choosing that they can invade my social bubble. They should step back, because I don't know them or where they have been. However, if you were out with a friend and you both consented to take the risk, then that is on you. But make sure you do whatever it takes to prevent possibly spreading the virus onto others, and self isolate if one falls ill.</p>

        <p>Intuitively, it really seems like masks should work. It really feels like they should. It would be great if they did. They don't. </p>
<p>People during the Black Death thought smelling herbs would stop the spread. We know better now. This is the same. Except for we actually already knew masks didn't work and we chose to throw out that science.</p>
