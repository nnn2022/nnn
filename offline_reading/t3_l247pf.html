    <strong>If you know someone who claims to "believe in science", ask them to explain the scientific method to you on the spot.</strong>
    <p><p>It's hilarious. They don't know what the fuck to say. It's clear that they know nothing about science. Every. Single. One. Of. Them.</p>
<p>Science is filling the god-shaped hole in society. It's turned into a cult with its own high priests (i.e. Fauci, mask be upon him), its own rituals of self-abasement (muzzling and lockdowning), and even has its own heretics (us).</p></p>

<p>Belief in science is its own religion.  The Atheists are sure in the absence of God(or anything non-material)  - this is a religious position in itself.</p>

        <p>An agnostic is open to the possibility that God exists,  I am not. Because there is not a shread of evidence to back up the existence of spirits, or miracles. Agnostics in my opinion,  are atheists who don't want to offend believers.</p>

        <p>Ehh, I mean, the existence of gravity and the fact that the sky is blue are pretty fucking settled.</p>
<p>Other than that I respect your point. People forget that facts are a representation of our current understanding of an issue, it's not set in stone and that's why it's so authoritative. It's what the evidence at present shows and that makes it true unless you can prove otherwise.</p>

        <p>The sky is purple during the day, we just perceive it as blue. Rayleigh scattering preferences short spectrum wavelengths and therefore purple is the predominant wavelength, but because of the combination of our blue cone being most effectively stimulated at 450nm (middle of the blue spectrum) and the mild stimulation of the red and green cones we see light blue. </p>
<p>At least that is one of the leading theories, but not the only one, because the science is not settled.</p>
<p>Gravity is way more complicated.</p>

I think what OP is trying to emphasize is that when someone says “believe in science” that a complete bullshit argument particularly when we are talking about something that is forming policy and requiring people to wear something, close a business, and are being accused of being selfish and are responsible for murdering people and the reason we’re not allowed to open back up. </p>
<p>If you are going to make those claims, with those types of requirements, you had best be willing to back up those claims with real science and actually show said science that would justify your demands. You don’t just get to go around saying that shit without backing it up</p>

        <p>Oh, that's obvious, let's establish that. But people use these types of arguments to dispute basic facts and reject <em>any</em> science, and that's honestly even worse. That's what I was bitching about. You know, the flat earth types.</p>

        <p>Okay fair enough, but this is a part of a bigger issue we have in general. It seems to me we are including people in giant groups and assuming because they are in group x they all believe in y. And people are assigning these individual to  groups without ever speaking to that individual, or know anything about them. </p>
<p>A perfect example that we are seeing in real time would be the QAnon thing. At first it was just q, then people started saying q people, flat earthers, anti Vaxers are all the same. Now we’ve gotten to the point where we are seeing them generalize  conspiracy theorists as a whole are anti vax, q, flat earthers, and connecting it all with like white supremacy and terrorism? </p>
<p>To me that is a problem, because just saying someone conspiracy theorists according to the government, means that they are a danger to society. A literal domestic terrorist. I personally do look into conspiracy l, but I don’t subscribe to those groups and what they believe. I’m not an irrational person and if I look into something on the conspiracy side of things, I do really make an effort to take real tangible evidence, and form a rational thought about whatever it may be. </p>
<p>On a more fundamental level take this for example......I think we can all agree that the government, and main stream news sites have done nothing to earn our trust. And they also have been caught in real acts of conspiracy A TON. What is troubling to me is that the government is now basically saying anyone who challenges the official narrative is a domestic terrorist. </p>
<p>The danger in that is fairly alarming, because it is a threat to all of us as citizens. If you ever have a dissenting opinion you could easily be thrown into that group of crazy white supremacist terrorists, just for disagreeing with the government narrative.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, don't worry, I agree with you on most of your points. Actually, I'm worried that the generalizing and stereotyping of the right wing is actually and unironically akin to that done to victim groups when genocide happens, and that in the next few months or years the left will try something. But that's a different discussion and not what I'm bitching about.</p>
<p>Some of the conspiracy theories, like specifically flat-earth for example, have been investigated by tons of people and found to be bupkis, but people will still push them and bully others for using science to discredit those ideas. The flat-earth theory for example is flat-out wrong, period. Like factually wrong. And yet they abuse and discredit people for using science on the grounds that I was bitching about. And that's plain wrong. </p>
<p>It's plain wrong to tell people they're being unscientific by citing authoritative science to back up a claim when the *whole point* of the academic community is to enable people to do that without having to waste time and effort reproducing experiments themselves. </p>
<p>It doesn't mean the system is perfect, it has its flaws like any other system, but it's the most perfect one we have so far, specifically because it acknowledges its imperfections and is designed specifically to enable progress. And this anti-science mindset many people here are adopting in response to the tyrannical assholes abusing the authority of science is really, *really* not helpful, specifically because the authoritative science backs up the claims that masks don't work. </p>
<p>People shouldn't be able to just reject science off-hand and not get called out on it.</p>

        <p>Agreed on the first part that most certainly is a discussion for another time, just to add one thing to that though. It’s refreshing to hear someone recognize that is most certainly cause for concern. the right is doing the same thing to the left as well and that’s just such a horrific recipe for disaster. </p>
<p>Back to your point, yeah the flat earth is flat out wrong (lame pun intended). And yeah I haven’t paid attention to them in so long So haven’t seen any bullying. But I can totally see that happening and I would absolutely take you at your word that that’s happening lmao.</p>
<p>Some people are taking a anti science stance as well. But I can tell you right now, the people that who are like that are not how most of us interested in discussing “conspiracy” think. I actually shouldn’t speak for anyone but myself actually. The people that are flat earth, QAnon believers etc. are not helping someone like myself to even feel as though I don’t even want to try to voice my opinion on things. I’m nowhere near being anti science. I’ve been working in the environmental sciences my whole career and a lot of that time spent as a chemist. I’m not saying that for credibility, my point is I love the environment and want to take care of it.</p>
<p>The issue I have is with these flat earth type  people, they are becoming like representatives of me who is a skeptic particularly with government, corporations etc. the basic idea without getting into details, is that when I see a crisis like the one we are having now, I will be looking into how it will be used and manipulated by people in power to oppress and control people through fear, confusion and division. And my concern that will put me in the anti science whacked out conspiracy theorist category which is not remotely true at all.</p>

        <p>Have someone drop an apple on your head and then stop resorting to strawman to discredit science -- and reality.</p>
<p>The color of the sky is largely a neurological and social phenomenon since it's our brains interpreting the light that comes in through our eyes, and we gave a label to the color we see the sky as the vast majority of the time: blue. And the vast majority of the people in the world throughout human existence see it as such, ergo the sky is blue. </p>
<p>You aren't just being pedantic, you quite frankly are being abusive and disputing basic, easily observable facts is a huge aspect of how abuse works. Check yourself. You won't make me doubt what I and billions of others see with our own eyes and feel with our own skin. You really are hurting people telling them to doubt that shit, especially something so fundamental to the scientific method to begin with.</p>
<p>The sky is blue and the grass is green. Gravity exists.</p>
<p>The fact you think science disputes any of those points shows you don't understand science or the scientific issues you just copied and pasted from a Google search in hopes of discrediting it.</p>
<p>You'll be arguing 2 + 2 does not equal 4 just to be an ass next.</p>

        <p>The best way I can think of it is to say “This is what I believe given the evidence we have today”. As has already been said science is very fluid by its own nature but we still don’t see as many rational, data backed arguments that are for the popular world narrative as we see for going against it. Unless you’re only paying attention to the MSM of course.</p>

        <p>They actually have, in fact, already began their assault on the scientific method. Consider <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-idea-that-a-scientific-theory-can-be-falsified-is-a-myth/">this article</a> from Scientific American back in September, wherein the author asserts that falsifiability--i.e. the notion that a theory, in order to be scientific, needs to be falsifiable via experiment or observation--is in fact a myth! According to the author...</p>
<p>&rt;...the strength of scientific conclusions arises because credible experts use comprehensive bodies of evidence to arrive at consensus judgments about whether a theory should be retained or rejected in favor of a new one. These consensus judgments are what have enabled the astounding levels of success that have revolutionized our lives for the better. It is the <em>preponderance of evidence</em> that is relevant in making such judgments, not one or even a few results. </p>
<p>There you have it. Who cares if one or two experiments disprove some theory? As long as the consensus of credible experts still agrees with it, then it's true.</p>
<p>So yes, they are in fact changing the definition of science itself, to basically be "whatever the consensus of approved experts say is true."</p>

        <p>Quote by Max Planck: "Science advances one funeral at a time." As all the old fart priests die, then things advance. The biggest gain will be when the fauci goes to his "eternal reward." Digging into his past is <strong>very interesting</strong> to say the least! (can't say more: "PC") The whole current hysteria has been organized completely as a religion. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/church-of-fear">https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/church-of-fear</a> There is a nicely packaged up "satan" ~~scam virus~~ for you to fear. There are the "nice priests" ~~corrupt medics~~ who will anoint you with their "holy oil" ~~noxious vaccine~~. Once all partake of the baptismal "holy oil", there will be no more death. How more utterly effing religious can you get? But the cultist sheep are so brainwashed that they have swallowed all of that sh*t and won't hear of anything else. It will take a generation or two to wash all that crap away.</p>

        <p>I got a BS in chemistry from a large state university. One thing they fail to make clear to science students is that if you have a theory about something...your real job as a scientist is to try as hard as you can to prove it WRONG. The more curveballs you can throw at your theory and it still holding up, the more you or other people try to disprove it and fail, is what makes the theory good or bad. The process of picking apart papers and theories IS CALLED SCIENCE.</p>
<p>If masks are maybe able to stop shit from growing in a Petri dish when you sneeze on it...great...that’s not useless information. However, it is absolutely NOT SCIENTIFIC PROOF that masks should be worn by everyone because it will reduce transmission.  You cannot draw such a conclusion based on test that did not actually address the question: “do masks stop transmission when implemented in everyday life in the general public?”</p>

        <p>I've been thinking about that whole religion thing. Science is a big part of the wider modern religion that follows the beliefs of the general Internet, but it lacks the positives of a religion and behaves more like a cult. It makes me ask the question - Do most people need religion?</p>

        <p>I pretty much say this exact same thing to people trying to make an argument against the narrative. Stay calm, keep it factual and don’t get personal and the facts will speak for themselves in the end. Many just say “whatever” and give up. Hopefully the others go away and question their beliefs.</p>

        <p>All i am saying is, you can't expect someone with no actual experience in a certain field to give an educated answer on that subject.</p>
<p>Now that being said, i hate when something that should be about factual evidence gets turned into something political, like biology should. Because the moment something is political it's no longer objective, it becomes subjective, just like politics.</p>
<p>Also, science is more a concept than it is anything else really. A lot of it is based on theory and hypotheticals when it comes to things that we don't understand yet. So science becomes factual when there is evidence basically.</p>
<p>When you talk about science you have a lot of subcategories like, chemistry, biology and math. The reason the average person can't explain science is because there is no simple way explain it. It all depends on what you're looking for and what scientific method you're trying to use. And either that method works for what you're trying to achieve or it doesn't. </p>
<p>Science is(or used to be at least) a way to receive objective evidence. But now that it has become political, it's nowhere near objective. It's being twisted and turned into what people want it to be. </p>
<p>A lot of science today bullshit, you should be skeptical.</p>

        <p>What does that prove? How can you use a computer and say science doesn’t work? </p>
<p>I needed a part made on a CNC for a project I’m working on. I don’t know the first thing about how to use one of those machines but I Trusted the guy who’s trade it was to know this stuff. Just because I don’t understand how something works doesn’t mean I can’t trust it. </p>
<p>Doctors are really skilled in their trade. But I bet 99% of them couldn’t change a wall outlet. This world works by having people with diverse skill sets to preform goods and services. </p>
<p>Why the beef with doctors? Can you disprove any of their science with real research to the contrary? And none of the “he said no masks then he said masks” kinds stuff. You learn new information, you respond according. That’s how every industry works.</p>
