        <p>So like 2 weeks into Texas' resumption of actual normalcy and cases haven't exploded like doomers thought they would. As expected, just like we saw in Florida... But of course they'll just say it's the "vaccines at work" even though not nearly enough people have been vaccinated to pinpoint the lack of exploding cases entirely to vaccinations. I know how doomers brains operate lmao. Virus seasonality is a myth to them even though it's been demonstrated several times throughout the course of this pandemic.</p>

        <p>I feel like some of them deep down know we are right. But they are just too invested in the false narrative to back down now. Put yourself in their position. Imagine having to come in terms with yourself that you lost a year of your life for nothing.</p>

        <p>Wouldn't it be nice if human psychology worked like that?</p>
<p>Except a lot of people need their feelings validated and are scared that if they're not only wrong, they're wrong in a big way that if they ever try and assert their authority again, they'll have their big wrong revisited upon them:</p>
<p>"You were wrong, oh and by the way, remember that time you were a bossy little bitch about it?  Yeah, I'm never listening to your opportunistic ass again."</p>
<p>So much for the power that they're enjoying now.</p>

        <p>welcome! I was ambivalent about covid stuff until I was yelled at for having a medical exception from wearing masks. I'd been offline for over six months and away from TV. I had no clue it was political. So I looked into it to make up my mind for myself. People already assumed I was a belligerent conspiracy theorist terrorist, so I really had nothing to lose. I started going to protests and put up some homemade posters! If I'm gonna be punished, I might as well do the crime</p>

        <p>I think it's a culling due to how many nursing home patients are on Medicare etc using our tax money...People have been BANNED from visiting family in nursing homes since the beginning of Covid yet the number of deaths IN nursing homes are insanely high. NY had over 15K Nursing Home Deaths they had to start burying people in mass graves and renting freezer trucks for body storage. Michigan is possibly even worse. Now for the part you DONT see.</p>
<p>Some Nursing homes even here in Texas have set up "Covid units" which are hallways that are taped off usually with big sheets of plastic. The nursing home residents IN the Covid units have to stay in the room without coming out. Employees wear masks and gowns etc. That may sound like a good thing but here's the flip.
Some Nursing Homes have a rule where if the Nursing Home patient LEAVES the nursing home for any reason they have to go to the Covid unit for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>For example... Let's say your Granny stays in a nursing home and has a fall and hit her head and they call an ambulance to take her to the ER to be checked out. The ER will give her a covid test. Turns out she's fine and shows negative for Covid. She then gets returned to the nursing home but is taken to the "Covid unit" automatically for 2 weeks. Well the thing is she's going to have a much higher possibility of catching Covid if she's ON the Covid unit and not sick. After 2 weeks the patient is then returned to the general population of the nursing home. So if the patient DID manage to get Covid while on the Covid unit they would then be freely spreading it like a hardcore flu through the rest of the nursing home. When I brought this up at a local nursing home that it seems it would promote spread I was told they had "lost" about a dozen residents but they were following the companies Covid orders. To me it seems more like a culling...</p>
<p>I've brought this up several times to people that it seems backwards but it's fallen of deaf ears. I recommended emptying out an ENTIRE nursing home and using it ONLY for Covid positive patients and when they're better they could be returned. Like what was supposed to happen with the USS Mercy in NY. </p>
<p>Who do you report these issues to? The currupted Health Department? The currupted CDC?</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea imagine that MOST nursing homes are following this outline in every county... In every state all over the US. Do you think it would cause an increase in deaths?</p>

        <p>According to the CDC guidelines, covid units are for confirmed covid patients only.  Suspected or possible cases are to be isolated, but not cohorted with confirmed cases for the reason you cited.  </p>
<p>The people that I know who work in nursing homes in various states spent a year working and worrying themselves into exhaustion trying to protect their patients.  One who is in a managerial position wants to quit and is coping with depression, but she helped keep covid away from most of the patients and now they are all fully vaccinated.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this has highlighted existing problems.  Nursing homes vary in quality a lot.  I have not had to make a nursing home decision for a family member, but others have told me that the differences can be shocking.   And unfortunately with covid, a few careless staff members or outsiders had serious consequences at even good nursing homes.</p>

        <p>I'm told my university will be open next semester. Well, partially at least. They're including a bunch of dumbass rules regarding occupancy limits, distancing, and most likely mask-wearing. My advisor didn't mention required vaccines, but I wouldn't rule it out.  </p>
<p>My school's subreddit is obviously insufferable. It's quite bizarre really. My peers are split 50/50 between loving and hating lockdowns. But for those that hate lockdowns, they still subscribe to the narrative that we're in a GFP (Global Fucking Pandemic). A lot of them are clamoring for the vaccine and are so excited for their turn. It's so weird to witness. They come from radically different social ecosystems.</p>

        <p>Locking a child in a room for two weeks, in 2019 it was called child abuse, in 2021 it's "for their own good".</p>
<p>This was the last straw for me, I was understanding when these people wanted to wear masks and inject themselves with experimental drugs, it's a free world. I was annoyed when they started talking of banning travel and gym access, fine I don't mind staying in one country for a few years and I don't care for gyms, I'll survive.</p>
<p>But when they start locking up their own god damn children, they are committing abuse against the very people they should protect and are clearly not fit to make any sane decision. Congrats to them for breaking my considerable patience with their bs.</p>

        <p>This subreddit has been very disappointing. I feel the need to vent because I, like most people, am sick of the stigma that everyone is assumed to be sick until proven so, and in general, I don’t like wearing a mask. Do I anyway? Yea, because businesses mandate it. I’ve definitely gone out a lot less and do more online shopping now because going out just feels less enjoyable in general. </p>
<p>But lord, I come here to vent and see if other people feel the same way and it’s a bunch of conspiracy, anti government, anti vaccine nonsense. If we want things to go back to normal, we should be hyped that the vaccine is available in May. I’m probably not going to get it, but my girlfriend will and she’ll finally be more comfortable going out and that’s great.</p>

<p>If you're not anti-government at this point, idk what to tell you. There are serious problems in the country and for some reason they just <em>can't</em> be fixed. If you can acknowledge that, then it's clear that there are problems that the government is capable of fixing but <em>won't</em>. This holds true regardless of your ideology. Fuck the government.</p>

        <p>1.9 trillion dollars could give $9000 to every US adult, no strings attached. If they were actually providing for us and cared for the needs of small businesses and such, then this subreddit wouldn't exist.  </p>
<p>But that's the thing. They don't care. If you want people to stay home, <em>pay them to.</em> Frankly, the social fabric of America is so torn apart that telling people "we're all in this together" and to "do their part" just won't cut it. Money rules.   </p>

        <p>I agree. I think in my country (germany) big companies got extra money while making profit nonetheless. 
Owners of small businesses feel left alone. That's not remotely fair and I would have hoped to see it done differently. </p>
<p>Why I am so shocked to see this sub is more the amount of conspiracy theories and especially the unwillingness to help others out by wearing a mask or doing something remotely close to helping end this pandemic. </p>
<p>It's just sad that some here are fighting those measurements while a friend of mine lost his whole family (grandparents and father) because of this virus f.e. </p>
<p>I understand criticism against the lockdowns, etc. and it's important to prevent the overuse of those measurements, but saying that this pandemic is a fake is not realistic at all.</p>
<p>I understand conspiracy myths too but all this Bill Gates shit is just simply laughable. </p>
<p>I would hope that people that embrace lockdowns and other measurements and people that don't could agree on a concensus, but this sub is so far away from being able to be taken seriously that this wouldn't work.</p>

        <p>&rt; the unwillingness to help others out by wearing a mask or doing something remotely close to helping end this pandemic</p>
<p>That's what I'm getting at. There's no way you can just <em>convince</em> people to help others in a society that's been so purposely broken down socially. I feel zero obligation to the people in this country. We have nothing in common. That's how most people are whether they know it or not.  </p>
<p>The government obviously doesn't wanna incentivise mask-wearing any more than saying "it's the right thing to do" which by their own admission isn't cutting it. If they wanted to incentivise staying home and wearing masks, they would support their citizens economically. Since they <em>aren't</em> doing that, they obviously don't actually care.  </p>
<p>Sorry about your friend. Most of us don't deny the existence of a pandemic though. We just believe it's heavily overblown and only the at-risk age groups should consider preventative measures. When we say the pandemic is "fake" we're really talking about the govt response, and how it's all to enrich the elites. Masks don't work, and personally I think they're a means for average joes ("doomers") to police non-conformists. This creates a completely artificial conflict which serves to distract from the fact that there's a giant wealth transfer going on.  </p>
<p>In sum, there's no material incentive to following the guidelines (aside from fleeting social media status). We just want our lives back.</p>

        <p>Firstavle thanks for your kind response. 
I'm sure the posts on this sub are extreme and don't reflect the average member. </p>
<p>I've never been to the US, so I don't know terribly much about your economy and culture except all the hollywood stuff and some american friends in my town. So my view is from the german standpoint. </p>
<p>I think it's very sad to hear that helping others needs a compensation in your eyes. You probably have more in common than you think, and even if not that's not a reason to risk their lives. </p>
<p>There's a destinction for me; there are people who don't care about the virus and hopefully do the minimum to help. If not I'm writing that off as dumbness/ignorance. Unfortunately can't change that. 
What I think is worse are people who purposefully rally <em>against</em> all measurements. 
In most cases it has to do something with conspiracy myths and these people purpusefully hurt others in an act of a political statement. 
That's not okay at all and this sub is a breeding ground for exactly that.</p>
<p>Regardless of the government in your country, if there is a possibilty to prevent your next door grandma from dying, wear a mask (and yes they help if used correctly). I'm not trying to paint the picture of the poor old grandma for my agenda btw, those people are just at the highest risk.</p>
<p>But you are certainly correct. Incentivising/making up for any losses that you encounter while fighting this pandemic should be a given. </p>
<p>I disagree with the mask being a politcal tool. Some are trying to make them be that.</p>

        <p>True, was talking about the whole subreddit and just left my comment here. Probably wrong place.
But I stand to it, if you really all think the common things posted here my hope for humanity is lost.</p>
