        <p>Lol.  </p>
<p>Yeah, I called this one months ago.  The first time I heard "you cannot gain immunity from this virus".</p>
<p>For the record, what a load of absolute nonsense.  Of course humans can gain some level of immunity from this virus.  That's how our immune systems work.</p>
<p>If it didn't work like that, everyone who got the virus would die.</p>

<p>Out of all the weirdo, zero-logic horseshit people swallowed about COVID last year, this might be the worst.</p>
<p>First of all, how would we know if its only been around for a few months.</p>
<p>Secondly, WHY would we assume this particular coronavirus is the opposite of every other coronavirus that we've coexisted with since the dawn of humanity? </p>
<p>Thirdly, if we can't, what's the logical endpoint of all these measures?</p>
<p>People have zero reasoning and logic and that was exposed in 2020. We're reverting back into a more animalistic type of species that's incapable of thought.</p>

        <p>Every time someone said this about covid, my response was, "Then they can stop wasting time and money working on a vaccine. If you can't get immunity from actually getting infected, you certainly won't get it from a shot."</p>

        <p>Which is true depending on how you define immunity. Up to slight symptoms like tiredness of which 50% of the population don't notice as such at their level? <em>bam</em> 98% immune. No infection possible because of cross immunity? Still 30%.<br>
The problem is that they don't adhere to their own definitions and change meanings monthly, sometimes weekly.</p>

        <p>How? I think the government strategically infecting groups of people is a lot more violating than just offering vaccinations. How do you strategically infect the young without overwhelming hospitals? </p>
<p>Vaccinations give you immunity without being sick for 2-4 weeks and taking up hospital resources.</p>

<p>Of course you can gain immunity, however not from new strains that will inevitably pop up if the virus is not brought under control.</p>

<p>Herd immunity cannot happen without a vaccine. If we were to give everyone the virus in hopes of achieving "natural" herd immunity variants would pop up and spread as well every season making it essentially impossible.

        <p>Thank you.  Allow me to correct you on some of your misconceptions.</p>
<p>&rt;1. Of course you can gain immunity,</p>
<p>Thank you.  That's basically the end of the thread right there.</p>
<p>&rt;however not from new strains </p>
<p>How many strains do you think there have been from the beginning?</p>
<p>And, why then would a vaccine work?  Wouldn't you need a vaccine for every strain?</p>
<p>&rt;2. Herd immunity cannot happen without a vaccine.</p>
<p>Well, no.  Herd Immunity can be reached either through inoculation, or natural infection.</p>
<p>&rt;If we were to give everyone the virus in hopes of achieving "natural" herd immunity variants would pop up and spread as well every season making it essentially impossible.</p>
<p>Same argument about the vaccine.  We would need a vaccine for every single variant.  </p>
<p>&rt;(Herd immunity has never been achieved with the flu but it has been brought under control.)</p>
<p>(Yes.  Through natural immunity.)</p>
<p>&rt;3. "Natural" herd immunity would result in a few million extra deaths and countless disabilities and further damage to the economy.</p>
<p>Well, no.</p>
<p>Further damage to the economy?  Further?  How could it possibly be further than it is now?</p>
<p>Countless disabilities?  This is a nonsensical argument.</p>
<p>Few million extra deaths?  Okay.  So maybe we should just lock down forever.  That way, no one would ever die.  Does that sound like a good idea?</p>

        <p>Ironic because if <em>you</em> had any basic knowledge of biology you’d know that it’s possible to have it and transfer it to others without realizing. </p>
<p>I doubt anyone has actually blamed you for 500,000 deaths. But I don’t doubt that many people have tried to get you to understand that you very realistically could be responsible for a few of them. Denial doesn’t change the negative impact of your apathy.</p>

        <p>If you really believed all that (which I doubt) would you be open to signing a DNR for when you get Covid, I think this is a great compromise, if you don’t want to wear a mask, social distance, stay home, or get the vaccine, then great! All you have to do is sign a paper that says, if I get Covid I can’t go to the hospital for Covid, this is great. You don’t believe science ? Wow that’s amazing, you get no help from science! If you don’t sign this you are a chicken shit who can talk but does not have the stones to stand up for anyone else. Have a great day</p>

        <p>Oh please correct me then if I'm wrong, because like I said herd immunity is just throwing people at the virus and hoping enough people live to protect the minority that never caught it. while getting a vaccine is making sure that everyone's protected from the virus while no one gets hurt.</p>

        <p>Yes, a virus who (we knew in February) had a mortality rate on par with influenza and "long term effects" which are also exactly like the flu. This isn't smallpox. The deaths from lockdowns in both the UK and US have outstripped covid deaths.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, they don't have a vaccine. The "vaccine" just reduces the severity of the symptoms. But covid itself is 80% asymptomatic, so it's almost as effective as the vaccine.</p>

        <p>The first source has a 404 on the stated case report.</p>
<p>The second source looks promising but I would love to actually see their analysis.</p>
<p>The third source: That's to be expected with the older patient. But even 40% is remarkable.</p>

        <p>Yes it's death rate is on par with the flu (except in certain communities it is deadly and then the flu) but it's more contagious which makes it more dangerous also your solution shouldn't just be throw everyone at it and hope it ends out well It should be make sure everyone is protected and no one gets hurt while also trying to prevent it from spreading in the first place.( And no lockdown deaths have not killed more than covid for that to be true over half a million people in the US would have to die from staying at home which has not happened. actually there was a decrease in certain types of death when lockdown started And this is all without mentioning that lockdown has also prevented the virus from spreading even further and faster.)</p>

        <p>There is ONE group of people where this is deadlier than the flu. Over 80.  If you're under 65, it's substantially <strong>less dangerous</strong> than the flu. "Herd immunity" isn't like what Cuomo, Whitmer, and Murphy did, with sticking actively sick people in nursing homes to infect the most vulnerable. If very low risk people are exposed (which is basically everyone), then they will either fight it off and not get sick (but still have immunities) or will get mildly sick and get better. Then, they can't get sick with it again, so they can't transmit it. It cuts off routes to infection. Elderly people would take minimal precautions, and everyone else goes on as normal.</p>
<p>Lockdowns, and you need to realize this, actually INCREASE the herd immunity threshold because by "slowing the spread" you increase the number of people exposed to it before you hit herd immunity. There's a reason that literally no health organizations recommended lockdowns until they became politically desirable.</p>
<p>And, hopefully this will comfort you - half a million people didn't die from covid, either.</p>

        <p>Of course I know what herd immunity is It's not doing anything and the disease is still dangerous to people under 65 its just that it becomes more dangerous the older you get and the whole point of making sure younger people don't get sick so that they won't transmit it too older people who are more likely to get sick and die from it</p>
<p>And there's actually a long history of using lockdowns to stop viruses we've done it for many pandemics throughout history like just 20 years ago sergeant China they use lockdowns to slow the spread They used it with a bubonic plague And no one was making this political besides the right and conservatives</p>
<p>And yes I didn't say half a million people died That would be Ludacris It was 2 million out of 100 million cases, people don't want to cause panic That's like the exact opposite of what people want we just want people to understand the risk that come with this pandemic.</p>

        <p>It is, by definition, not dangerous to people under 65. You will get weird, random cases where a young, healthy person has a serious case - but you get that with flu. The point of herd immunity is getting people who will have little or no ill effects to be exposed - absolutely not "making sure younger people don't get sick so that they won't transmit it too older people." That is completely misguided.</p>
<p>We're not going to talk about China "locking down," because of course repressive totalitarian governments are willing to lock down and not care about the outcomes from it. Quarantines are for the sick, and, yes, people quarantine the sick. No one (aside from China) locks down healthy people.</p>

        <p>Okay covid is still dangerous to people under 65 It just not as dangerous to them as it is over 65 now not locking down would kill more people than locking down and trying to strive for herd immunity people will get infected hospitals will then be overrun and then people won't be able to get correct diagnosis or correct treatment and will lead to far more deaths now if we try to flatten the curve and make sure less people are getting infected so that less people need to be hospitalized so hospital's won't go over capacity would stop us from having these problems</p>

        <p>No. Lockdowns kill substantially more people under than age of 65 than covid would or did. It also prevents herd immunity by preventing the healthy herd from getting exposure. There is very very little indication that there would be an overrun of hospitals because of the incredibly high rate of asymptomatic cases and mild cases with younger people.</p>
<p>However, the lockdowns DID prevent people from getting treatment for cancer, from getting preventative care, and from getting treatment for heart and vascular conditions. But at least those people died at home so the hospitals weren't overrun.</p>

        <p>okay for lockdown to kill substantially more people they have to kill more than over half a million people in the US You do realize how dumb you sound right</p>
<p>Also covid kills a lot people who are under 65 around 20% of the deaths from covid are under 65 so around 1/4 of them.</p>
<p>we didn't have lockdowns in the beginning and we didn't even know what we were dealing with That's why hospitals were beginning to fill up now we understand what we're dealing with so we can kind of somewhat stop hospitals from filling up But what you want to do is just let everyone go out spread the virus which would then increase the amount of people who have it an increase hospitalizations which would then lead to the hospital's filling up and the mortality rate increasing Staying get home is far less deadly than just trying to go for herd immunity.</p>

<p>Covid, like flu, is seasonal. It'll hit, it'll peak, and then it will fade. Regardless of what you do. You can stretch it out and make it worse (which is what lockdowns do, by delaying herd immunity). But that's about it.</p>

        <p>Here's a simple question for you: how do you know lockdown has prevented the virus from spreading further and faster? Where is the study that actually shows that? Because, to take just one example, cases are currently increasing faster in California (strict lockdown) than South Dakota (minimal lockdown). Your side of the debate seems to operate from a position of assuming lockdowns do what they are meant to, and that makes the harms they cause worth it, but I have yet to see any solid evidence that they do any such thing.</p>

        <p>Recovery rates is 97% but goes down the older you are just because something has a high survival rate doesn't mean you just throw everyone at it and hope for the best
(For comparison the flu in 2018 had around 45 million cases and 61,000 deaths while covid-19 has around a hundred million cases with 2 million deaths The disparities between hospitalizations are also quite alarming)</p>

        <p>I’m not throwing anyone at anything? You seem to be placing blame where it doesn’t belong which is irrational. </p>
<p>Also your numbers are not accurate. The data is nonsense. Any cold or flu was counted as covid. Do you even know how the testing works? It doesn’t that’s why you have exaggerated fear numbers to push around social media sites. </p>
<p>Stop lol. The survival rate is so high you are promoting fear because it makes you feel good to virtue signal. </p>
<p>The real dangers are suicide, addicts relapsing, and household violence/child abuse. </p>
<p>The flu numbers were way above pandemic threshold in previous years and nothing was shut down. </p>
<p>Do you know how many babies are aborted each year? So it’s okay to kill off a bunch of babies but we gotta put everyone on house arrest for something with an incredibly high survival rate? </p>
<p>Your mainstream kiss ass logic is nonsense. You’re pointing fingers at the wrong people because the news is telling you to.</p>

        <p>okay when I say it's throwing people at a disease I mean just opening everything up not wearing masks not saying socially distant That's throwing people at the virus</p>
<p>As for my data I took the worldwide numbers of covid and a worldwide deaths although yeah the numbers can be inflated slightly it would only barely be off as a positive covid test  almost certainly means that you are infected so your point makes no sense</p>
<p>Okay first of all you're also virtue signaling everything is virtue signaling You saying you think the virus isn't that dangerous is you signaling your virtues so stop complaining about virtue signaling And the reason why I bring up death rates and survival rates is not to scare people or because it makes me feel good It's to show that there's a clear risk and engaging with some behaviors now that could lead to possible death or hospitalization.</p>
<p>Yeah suicides and relapses are all big problems and lockdowns have made them slightly worse but we have more bigger problems that we have to deal with right now like a virus that's killed 2 million people worldwide although I am all for making more infrastructure for these people to help them just right now theres a virus going on.</p>
<p>You didn't shut down things for the flu because it was less deadly and less dangerous I was a whole point of me comparing the two.</p>
<p>abortions have absolutely no relevance to what we're talking about also there nothing wrong with having an abortion.</p>

        <p>How can you come up with accurate data for covid numbers if the testing isn’t even accurate? False positives happen so often.</p>
<p>“Yeah suicides and relapses are all big problems and lockdowns have made them slightly worse”</p>
<p>You shouldn’t downplay suicides and relapsing because realistically that is the biggest threat to people right now not some virus with a survival rate above 97% as you said. </p>
<p>“You didn’t shut things down for a flu because it was less deadly”</p>
<p>What do you mean less deadly? You just said the survival rate of covid was 97% which is actually probably way higher considering the falsified data that has been formulated to create that number.</p>
<p>Abortions have everything to do with what we are talking about we are talking about life and death. You’re here regurgitating main stream falsified data talking about how scary it is and so many died?</p>
<p>So you’re saying the babies aren’t relevant only the covid deaths matter? </p>
<p>We live in times where people like you get to choose which form of death is relevant lol Jesus Christ come on.</p>

        <p>I upvoted you here because your points are valid in this comment.</p>
<p>A new question:<br>
Why have we not directed resources, aid and education to those in the "at risk" age group and those that serve them? Instead we have a general blanket policy for the entire population when we have known for some time (say, June 2020) that this virus is not a substantial threat to anyone under 65. Shit, even 50 if you wanted to go super conservative.</p>
<p>The amount of damage that has been caused by the "general population blanket policies" is astounding. Yet, our leadership has made no moves to rectify these damaging policies for almost 3 quarters. Why?</p>

        <p>Okay I understand that this is not going to make a lot of sense cuz I'm half asleep and my punctuation is going out the window and I'm going to be replying to both this comment and your other one because responding to both of them separately would take over 30 minutes cuz this sub has a really dumb comment delay </p>
<p>1st response</p>
<p>I understand what you're trying to do but you're mixing multiple sources one of them clearly stated in the first paragraph that it shouldn't be applied because it hasn't been peer-reviewed yet while your other ones were of old data only concerning America while I was talking about the world as a whole And then yesterday the sores only talked about one state which you then tried to apply to America which you didn't try to apply to the world so our numbers differed by a couple million because we're both using two different demographics.</p>
<p>2nd response
just wearing a mask saying socially distant and slowing and stopping the spread of covet is helping those who are at higher risk as is stopping their chance of even getting the virus although me I would love if we had better stimulus checks and better PPE for everyone and many others to help everyone in the country But sadly we didn't get any of this</p>
<p>I assume the damages you're talking about are suicides domestic abuse and drug relapses these are all horrible things but America wasn't doing anything for them before this all started but for me I'd say for suicides I don't really know what could be done this it is something that I don't look into much</p>
<p>As for relapses the decriminalization of these drugs would help in getting them treatment for their habits but that's something that we didn't have in America before so we can't really do much for it now.</p>
<p>For domestic abuse I really don't know what we could do to me this is personally the one that like that has affected the most is the only way to help with this will be to get away from the person which he can't do if he's stuck at home so I really don't know what you'd be able to do like that has affected a lot of these issues And we should work to fix them It's just a I don't know how we would</p>

        <p>FIRST RESPONSE</p>
<ol>
<li>You are correct. It is not yet peer reviewed. However, the sample size and CI are statistically significant. More effort should be put forth to repeat that experiment's methodology.</li>
<li>America's population is a large enough sample size to be representative of the global population. Yes, there are cultural differences that will affect the numbers region to region / country to country. However, you disregarding my sources because they are "America only" is not in good faith the the conversation. The old are the majority of deaths globally, so my point still stands. And it stands unaddressed because you decided to target my sources (which are valid) instead.</li>
</ol>
<p>To this same point, how are these "old" sources. The numbers I used in my comment were from a month ago. Hardly outdated for purposes of our discussion.</p>
<p>SECOND RESPONSE</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you show me evidence that masking and social distancing of those without symptoms is beneficial in a statistically significant way? Because everything I have read regarding those items in a communal setting are inconclusive.The only studies I have found that support masking and distancing are for either A) in a healthcare or home care setting and B) For those with symptoms.</li>
<li>PPE: We have it now. We also have trillions of dollars of aid now. Why was it not directed to those at risk? Which is my whole point: Why the blanket policies?</li>
<li>Correct, I was referring to the economic damages as well as the suicides, overdoses, DA, etc.</li>
<li>You are correct, we weren't really focusing much resources or attention to those items before the pandemic. But a key component here is that the government enforced the lockdowns, which increased the negative affects listed above. There is a touch of responsibility that has to be held for that. Both by the government and by the people supporting such measures. These people have determined that the marginal cost of those negatives listed above are less than the margin benefits of slowing the spread. I disagree and so do many others in this sub.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is the debate. Its not "the virus doesn't exist" or "Its just the flu". That is not the heart of any debate on this topic. The debate is "which course of action had the worse marginal cost to marginal benefit ratio".</p>
<p>When someone says "its just the flu". They are actually saying "We over-reacted to this pandemic and I'm frustrated by the marginal costs that are occurring"</p>

        <p>The best course of action is a lockdown's masks social distancing and trying to flatten the curve (I get that it's a meme on this sub but it is very important) although lockdowns are bad for suicide relapses and domestic violence. if we were to strive for something like herd immunity, where we forgo are precautions and just let people back out then we would have a spike in cases, hospitals will begin to overfill And people will begin to no longer get proper treatment and diagnosis which will lead to far more deaths, Right now the mortality rate is around 2%. (Maybe less than that) but if we were to go for herd immunity hospitals will fill up people won't be able to get their correct treatment and more people will die. But if we have lockdowns we take the proper precautions Yes things will be bad But it won't be as bad as if we try to go for herd immunity. cuz if we try to flatten the curve and we continue for our precautions then hospitals won't be overfilled we can continue to have the relatively low death rate that we have now or even lessen it.</p>

        <p>And that is our fundamental disagreement.</p>
<p>You propose masking and lockdowns for ALL as the greatest marginal benefit to marginal cost ratio.</p>
<p>I propose aid, education and resources to those that fall within the at-risk groups AND, of those, that agree to the government's terms in exchange for that aid and resources.</p>
<p>Instead, our leadership has made blanket policies that have had catastrophic effects on those that had little to no risk from the infection. And the maddening part of it is that they continue to double down on such policies.</p>
<p>The majority of the population is not at risk. They therefore do not receive the same marginal benefit while still bearing the marginal cost. We as a society are capable of redirecting resources to those in need / those that need protecting IF AND ONLY IF they agree to the protection in exchange for lockdown.</p>
<p>See, the thing is: Me and you disagree. Yet your viewpoint / world view is being enforced on me through our governmental leadership "for the greater good". Yet the marginal benefits to marginal cost ratio for me and the majority of the population is not in our benefit. Its to the benefit of a minority. That minority should be protected and we have better ways of protecting them than crippling the rest of us.</p>

        <p>Yeah...about that IFR (inverse of recovery rate):</p>
<p>Copy and paste from a previous comment</p>
<p>Yay! Data! I love data!</p>

<p>For every 1 positive Covid case there have been 4.8 undiagnosed cases. Sample size = 9,028. CI = 95%. This would mean a huge impact on the IFR.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/mortality-overview.htm">CDC states</a> 359,352 Covid deaths have occurred. They state 91% of these deaths were caused by Covid. The remaining 9% was Covid contributing to death but not the direct cause. But fuck it. We'll include the whole lot.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home">CDC states</a> 25.9M cases in total. This would produce an IFR of .359352 / 25.9 = 1.387% (98.613% recovery rate)</p>
<p>So let's go ahead and multiply our case count by 4.8 per the study linked at the top to now get an IFR of .359352 / 124.32 = 0.289%. Put another way 99.71% chance of survival if you were to be infected with the virus.</p>
<p>But wait! It gets better! Let's calculate out the age group that we have known for a VERY long time was the most susceptible to this virus and are truly the ones that resources and attention should be directed towards (instead of the entire society).</p>
<p>So the 65+ age group represents <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Cases-by-Age-Group.aspx">10.6% of the cases and 74.5% of the deaths</a>. If we removed this group from the data set, it would reduce our case count to 111.142M and our death count to 91,634; giving us an IFR for everyone under 65 years of age as 0.091634 / 111.142 = 0.082%. Put another way would be 99.918% chance of survival if you were to be infected with the virus and under the age of 65.</p>
<p>Time for this clown show to end.</p>

        <p>Of the same strain? Highly unlikely. So low that its not even worth humoring.</p>
<p>Of a new strain? Likely even better survivability as the previous immunities may help to reinforce the immune system response to the new strain.</p>
<p>Luckily Covid has shown to not be a quickly mutating virus. At least not a quickly as the flu.</p>
