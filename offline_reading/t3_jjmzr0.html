        <p>Only one person under 18 has died in ND. </p>
<p>Although I feel for the family, the fact they let their 17 year old daughter group up to be 350 lbs with asthma, diabetes, and multiple heart conditions astonishes me.</p>
<p>*Edit: I just want to add to my comment here. This should be borderline criminal to let your child health degrade so much like that while you take care of them, reading the article about her - it seems they encouraged it. COVID should be ala wake up call to these people to encourage better health and to take care of yourself to prevent lifelong illness, but instead we say healthy citizens must pay the price for their poor choices - I still don't understand this..</p>

        <p>wish a doomer could put themselves in the average high school teenagers’ position right now; they can’t go to school, so they can’t organize large parties or meet new people. </p>
<p>they have to wear masks and are expected to ‘sOciAlLy diStaNce!’ if they want to go almost anywhere. (assuming the movies, malls, cafes, or clothing stores are even open in their area.)</p>
<p>they have to stare at a Zoom call for 8 hours 5 days a week or else their grades plummet and their parents yell at them and potentially abuse them. </p>
<p>they can’t play any team sports and therefore athletes can’t get any scholarships.</p>
<p>spending the majority of their time inside the house with their abusive, narcissistic parents and caretakers when they should be outside socializing, getting their first jobs, playing sports and learning lessons about life.</p>

        <p>&rt;A biohazard</p>
<p>"a risk to human health or the environment arising from biological work, especially with microorganisms." So far I've seen enough to think masks don't cause a risk to a 'normal' human nor the environment. But talking about microorganisms. . . </p>
<p>&rt;Child abuse</p>
<p>This one's kinda fuzzy. Though mimic is important in development, children can still breathe and function just right with one. (And I'm thriving as always, so there's that.)</p>
<p>&rt;Discriminating against the disabled (e.g deaf)</p>
<p>Well, yes and no. Mimic plays a big role in communication, but there's still sign language. Not to say everyone knows how to 'speak' it, but still. That's like saying a big chair discriminates small people. There's still another chair; another way. It may cost more, but if it's worth it. </p>
<p>&rt;Discriminating against people with autism</p>
<p>I'd like to hear more about how it discriminates people with autism, like me. So far I don't feel discriminated at all. </p>
<p>&rt;Discriminating against people with other mental health issues</p>
<p>Depends. The variety is large.</p>
<p>&rt;Bad for your dental hygiene</p>
<p>Trough dryness caused by the masks bacteria can have more fun, yes, but if you clean your teeth correctly etc. it's just fine. </p>
<p>&rt;Terrible for the environment</p>
<p>If you're too lazy to get one you can wash, well yes. Otherwise, no. </p>
<p>Beep Boop I'm not a bot. This action was performed through boredom.</p>

Your moist warm air breathing into the mask all day and being touched by your hands constantly is a breeding ground for bacteria, plus if you actually are sick, you are just depositing a huge viral load into that mask via droplet buildup. Sounds like something I don't want to be around.</p>
<p>\&rt;  This one's kinda fuzzy. Though mimic is important in development, children can still breathe and function just right with one. (And I'm thriving as always, so there's that.) </p>
<p>"they can still breathe" lol sounds like something an abusive parent might say after locking their child in the basement. They can still breathe and we still fed them, it's not abuse!</p>
<p>To the point though, pretty common knowledge and obvious that seeing facial expressions is an important part in developing basic language and social skills as well as emotional intelligence for young children / babies. </p>
<p>There is other related factors as to why mandated mask wearing (and also many of the other rules being put into place) can be considered child abuse. I don't feel like getting into it right now though, others can expand on that or you can do your own research.</p>
<p>\&rt;  Well, yes and no. Mimic plays a big role in communication, but there's still sign language. </p>
<p>Have you ever watched someone use sign language? Facial expression is a big part of it. And those not fluent in it, can't really do lip reading with masks on either. Also, some people are not fully deaf, can still hear a bit, but muffled voices behind a mask and a plexiglass barrier, just makes things even harder.</p>
<p>\&rt;  I'd like to hear more about how it discriminates people with autism, like me. So far I don't feel discriminated at all. </p>
<p>Good for you. Everyone is different. Lookup face blindness. Several other aspects to this too, it has been talked about in this sub on other threads.</p>
<p>\&rt;  Depends. The variety is large. </p>
<p>Lol? So in other words, yeah. I didn't say every single type of mental health problem, obviously that is a huge spectrum.</p>
<p>\&rt;  Trough dryness caused by the masks bacteria can have more fun, yes, but if you clean your teeth correctly etc. it's just fine. </p>
<p>So in other words, you agree.</p>
<p>\&rt;  If you're too lazy to get one you can wash, well yes. Otherwise, no. </p>
<p>This isn't an argument. Yeah, if everyone "wasn't too lazy" they would not get disposable things and put garbage in the garbage can where it belongs. Except that they are, just because there are better alternatives than the one time use disposables, doesn't mean that they are not creating massive amount of waste and are not actively negatively effecting the environment right now. </p>
<p>\&rt;  Beep Boop I'm not a bot. This action was performed through boredom. </p>
<p>I don't understand why you would even say this if not a bot.</p>

<p>If you use one mask 50x and 50 masks 1x each, the first one produces 1/50 of the trash. So actually, they're way better. But if you're going with the "it all has a impact"; shame on humanity for breathing out carbondioxide (?). </p>

        <p>I live in Japan and teach English to young children here. I teach at 16 schools a week and schools have been open since May. No social distancing and only one school has children in mask. It’s pretty normal and NOT ONE CHILD OR TEACHER HAS BEEN SICK. Nor have I gotten sick and these little kids come up touching and hugging me all the time.</p>
<p>So I’d love those idiots to explain why 1,000’s of children here are fine going to school normally, oh... And during lockdown preschools were still open here and kids were just fine.</p>

        <p>Okay cool, here's my stance.</p>
<p>There has been contradictory statements from the beginning, Fauci stating what everyone knows that a Cloth mask will not protect you from a virus to now it needs to be enforced and punishable on a federal level. The fact the same people who are advocating something with no evidence after saying it will not work makes me question the sincerity behind these rulings. </p>
<p>We were told that masks protect by blocking covid from leaving your respiratory system via droplets solely. 
The CDC has finally admitted again that this is indeed not true. Although it does leave like that at times it is proven that it is able to leave in aerosol form,  the CDC mentions this strongly in their 2007 virus study about SARS. Not only does it aerosolize, but in that form it is able to remain airborne and they state for an undetermined amount of time. This means walking around unless a mask is specifically airtight, any aerosolized particles out the side go right out and into the person walking right behind you. </p>
<p>Masks only cover your respiratory system. 
This completely fails to take into account for the increased amount of face-touching people are doing now to constantly adjust masks. Constant face touching means complete risk whenever touching doors, grocery items, to-go bags, brushing your own clothing against surfaces - if anyone has touched those same surfaces before you, your percieved safety was just compromised because there is no way you can sanitize between touching everything. People argue that surfaces get sanitized though, but my work for example only sanitizes once every two hours that means there's a 2 hour spread people are interacting with 'dirty' surfaces. I am willing to argue increased sanitizing is a solution that could help. </p>
<p>Next, if masks were a solution that was an end solution, people could see their families in the nursing homes, people could go to church, and concerts - but we acknowledge there is too much risk so we cannot do that. I question the validity if in an area people promise to be disciplined about masks isn't safe, people not consenting to abide masks will not work. </p>
<p>Sweedens model has shown to be equivalent to ours. </p>
<p>Mask mandates show no correlation to slowing the spread, lockdowns only delay the spread (and increase death rates via people not getting treated for illnesses)</p>
<p>Lastly, I refuse to accept the this has no protection for you only others argument. I do not care if I get the virus and I do not need to force you to wear one for my health. Hospitals are meeting their PPE requirements, it's time to say if you are an at risk person and want to buy protective equipment, you should do so completely and I will do my part to help you be that limited at risk only shopping hours, government benefits to those who are at risk, increased community assistance - not making everyone else do that for you. 
I know more elderly people who are considered at risk who refuse to wear masks or lockdown because they understand one bad slip could be their last day, so getting sick is an equivalent risk. So many people I know would rather die from this (which already has a low risk) around their family and friends than be locked in a room away from everyone else and die alone because the government wont let them see their grandkids.</p>

        <p>One more I completely forgot to add:</p>
<p>We still do not have a definitive answer as to what it will take to end mask mandates; there is no timeline, case numbers will go up any time a mandate is lifted - will be a never ending cycle, what about people who refuse to vaccinate, and there is so little support for "the new normal." </p>
<p>There is no timeline to this, we were told two weeks to slow the spread and were what 7 months in? 
How long will it go on, I say let people take risks.</p>
