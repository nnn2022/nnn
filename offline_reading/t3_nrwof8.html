    <strong>My first run-in with the tankie doomers</strong>
    <p><p>This happened on my local subreddit, which turned out to be infected with a bizarrely rabid brand of cowardice. Nothing you guys haven't seen before, I'm guessing, but feel free to add this story to your list. While I've deleted by own comments from that sub, you can still see almost the whole discussion by going to</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/https://www.reddit.com/user/local_reviews/comments/nqfe9q/a_comment_i_posted_to_rchicago_which_got_censored/">http://archive.is/https://www.reddit.com/user/local_reviews/comments/nqfe9q/a_comment_i_posted_to_rchicago_which_got_censored/</a></p>
<p>and following the links. Short form: Somebody said that Pres. Biden would soon be pressuring Gov. Pritzker and company to end our local mask mandate. I said that I wasn't sure how much pressure any president could really put on a governor who wanted to dig in his heels and be stubborn. I said that what I thought would make a difference in the end would be when Chicago and Illinois noticed that they were  bleeding out, losing people and business so quickly that they know this place was dying, but that in the end, they'd do too little, too late.</p>
<p>The regulars in the sub went on the attack, straw-manned what I had to say, and then used downvoting as a tool of censorship when I corrected their distortions of my position and of recent history. They had the nerve to pretend that the mask mandates were the only limitation put on the freedom of the people in our area. I reminded them that the local government did a lot more than that. While small local businesses were shut down by force, Cook County (the county that the vast bulk of Chicago is in) continued collecting property tax, at a time when people weren't allowed the freedom to make money using their property. The consequences of this were altogether predictable - we had a rash of permanent business closings.</p>
<p>The question that I put to the sub was a simple one. Now that this was a part of our history, why would anybody from outside our area look in and think "this is a good place to invest my money"? Their response to that was to continue lying about what I wrote, at a time when my comments were now being automatically removed by bot.</p>
<p>After I noticed that, I just deleted my comments and blocked a few trolls. I did get a little backup from a regular on one of the anti-lockdown subs, which was nice, but I'm done with the local sub. That willingness to lie and keep on lying told me all that I needed to know about that crowd.</p>
<p>It was different.</p>

<p>Note: I tidied up the prose a little. If anybody wants to see the original version of this post, he should be able to find it in Archive Today.</p></p>
