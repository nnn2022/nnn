        <p>Same. I have had a greeter offer me a mask, but I just said "No, thank you," and kept walking. I live in Michigan.

        <p>&rt;1% chance of killing you and the people around you</p>
<p>That's a lie, pure and simple. COVID disproportionately affects the old and the morbidly obese over the young and healthy, and by young, I mean under 65. According to my county's numbers, I have a .04% chance of dying of COVID. The number of deaths in my age group has not changed since Thanksgiving, not by one death, and we had a massive surge of cases over the holidays. Standard of care changed. We stopped putting people immediately on ventilators. The reason there were so many deaths from this disease early on is because of our standard of care, and because Democrat governors put sick patients in nursing homes, killing thousands. I didn't do that. The people championing lockdowns did.</p>
<p>&rt;run out of capacity</p>
<p>We've been told this for over a year now. Hospitals routinely have to adjust capacity for seasonal illnesses. You're telling me our medical system hasn't adapted to changes in demand? Bullshit. And if so, that failure is on them. Meanwhile, hospitals all across the country sat empty this whole past year. You wouldn't know that if you just watched the news. I have friends in healthcare all over the country. They tell me the same thing. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>&rt;unknown long term affects</p>
<p>We know more about those "affects" for the disease than we do for the vaccines.</p>
<p>&rt;continue living your life</p>
<p>That's exactly what I have been doing. While all the world panics, half the population still goes out, shops, dines, visits friends and family. Nothing happens. We're all fine here in the real world. We're actually doing a lot better now that the paranoid authoritarians have locked themselves up. You can stay locked up. We're happier without you. And we're healthier too. We get sun, we exercise, we're more emotionally stable, we don't live in fear. We build our immune systems. We started to reach herd immunity long before the vaccines hit the market. We're doing great. But please, don't fuck it up for us. Just stay home.</p>

        <p>why are so many people worried about covid then? wouldnt someone trustworthy publish this information if it were true? is it just incompetence or is there some conspiracy?</p>
<p>full disclosure, ive been following protocol and just got vaccinated. i just wanted to hear your take.</p>
<p>like, i havent looked at the numbers too closely, but i imagine that, whatever the deathrate is, it's bad. and maybe we flattened the curve enough to not overload hospitals.</p>
<p>i just think you have to make a lot more assumptions to believe that this is a hoax. tons of people have to be lying, there's got to be some strategy for it all, and if that were all true, if all these people were lying, you really wouldnt stand a chance against some combined effort by everyone. like, that's what keeps me from straying into conspiracies. if someone orchestrated covid, they have a crazy amount of power in the world. the fact that covid was engineered makes some sense to me, as not many people would have to be in on that, but the virus itself would have to be at least as deadly as it sounds because that would be extra difficult to cover up. you'd need to falsify information everywhere.</p>
<p>anyway, happy to read links you post... even if they're babylon bee lol, that website is pretty funny.</p>

<p>This is actually a strong suspicion that I have. Is it that people died <em>from</em> COVID or <em>with</em> COVID?</p>
<p>There's no doubt to me that people are dying from COVID, but when an agenda is being pushed, it seems that bending statistics to suit the narrative is a commonly abused tactic.</p>
<p>Just look at how gun death statistics are misused in the effort to claim guns are "a public health concern"</p>
<p>So, I wonder just how many people died of something, but because they were COVID positive they got a big red check so that statistcs would support Governors shutting their states down. Fuck Cuomo, btw.</p>

<p>yeah, I agree on this point, gun deaths are super small and the debate is way larger proportionally than the number of people that die. If we spent as much time on each covid death as we do with each gun-related death, the new networks wouldn't have time to talk about anything else lol. I want to be PC tho, so I just chalk up the concern to the amount of terror it generates, idk, it's kinda mental gymanstics in a sense, like people are afraid of going out because of gun violence. But then like, reporting gun violence in the media is just making that worse... and maybe we're so focused on gun violence that we're wasting time that could be spent solving more practical problems. I have no evidence to back this up, it's just something I feel.</p>

        <p>I mean, the Project Veritas video of the CNN technical director explaining how the COVID cases were always being pushed to the forefront was pretty suggestive that the network played into that exact type of thing.</p>
<p>The problem I think is that COVID was controlled too early for their liking: none of the hospitals were overrun to the extent initially suggested (the Mercy and Comfort were barely used) and by June it was basically over. So, with it all under control, how do they honestly report that the pandemic is still going?</p>
<p>Even now, the vaccines are being distributed, new cases are stable, hospitalizations are down (nurses are choreographing dance routines for Tik Tok, ffs), but so many are still clinging to the vibe from an entire year ago. By every measure I can think of, this is over, but you wouldn't know it if you looked at the businesses in your area.</p>

        <p>&rt;I mean, the Project Veritas video of the CNN technical director explaining how the COVID cases were always being pushed to the forefront was pretty suggestive that the network played into that exact type of thing.</p>
<p>that's a pretty interesting video.</p>

<p>You saw the same video I did, right? He said, "COVID? Gangbusters with ratings,” and, “Which is why we constantly have the death toll on the side,” and, "I’ve even looked at it and been like, ‘Let’s make it higher.’ Like, why isn’t it high enough, you know, today?”</p>
<p>This guy seemed intoxicated as he was talking it, but not to a level that I feel he was talking out his ass, either.</p>
<p>&rt;shits still pretty bad and cases are rising</p>
<p>I was speaking to the local numbers of my county and in my state, not globally. Global cases may rise, but I'm not in this sub because of how a foreign nation decides to handle their outbreaks, nor do I have a vested interest in how their society changes moving forward.</p>
<p>America is overall stable, with hotspots every so often. I don't think it's out of control.</p>

        <p>I don't think is a hoax at all. I think it's a serious illness that is disproportionately fatal to exactly the kind of people you would expect - those who are already exceptionally vulnerable. I think we as a global society have utterly failed to take measured, thoughtful, evidence-based responses to this disease. We've traded our economic futures and individual liberties to stave off a disease that simply put isn't that bad.</p>
<p>People are worried for many reasons. One, countries like Italy had terrible death tolls, and that tainted our expectations in the US. Italians are on average far older than Americans, and they chain smoke, among other possibly significant cultural differences.</p>
<p>Two, New York was a massacre. Even while it was unfolding people were pointing out that nearly all the deaths were in nursing homes. Nursing home outbreaks have been catastrophes. You do not live in a nursing home, but if you were to watch the COVID daily death ticker on CNN (now removed since Biden is in office) you wouldn't know, because those distinctions were never presented to you.</p>
<p>Leading to three, the media went all in on fear mongering on this, both because it made Trump look bad, and also because, as a CNN executive recently admitted on tape, fear sells. He also admitted it was propaganda.</p>
<p>Four, we live now in a doctatorship, where white lab coats do what any hammer does - treat every problem as though it's a nail. Fauci et al keep insisting on draconian, even illogical policies regardless of their implications on economic futures or individual liberties (Fauci expressly admitted this only a few days ago during his testimony to Congress).</p>
<p>Five, the death tolls are now FAMOUSLY embellished. Suicide while COVID positive? That's a COVID death. Hit by a car? COVID death. Bungee accident? COVID. I know two people who died of COVID. One was very old, died in an accident, and his death certificate says COVID. The other was put on a respirator immediately. We now know this type of treatment killed countless patients. Guess what killed him. Guess what his death certificate says. That was almost a year ago. Again, medical approaches have changed. Survival is way, way up.</p>
<p>There's a half million people in my county. No one cares about COVID at this point. We go out, we party, drink, dine out, shop, whatever. It's fine. We're moving past the fear and the lies, and we're happier for it.</p>

        <p>&rt;fear sells
I believe this and this is a problem with the media. The sources that rile up viewers do better and get a larger platform and it's a downward spiral to who can find the most shocking stories and cause fear in the public. This isn't my claiming that covid is overblown tho, I think this is a separate problem.</p>
<p>That stuff about NY kinda makes sense, you can see crazy differences in the number of deaths between age groups:</p>
<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109867/coronavirus-death-rates-by-age-new-york-city/</p>
<p>but it's also like 30x more deadly for that age group (people below age 50) I think (numbers dont line up exactly):</p>
<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1127799/influenza-us-mortality-rate-by-age-group/</p>
<p>I found some reports saying that respirators killed people:</p>
<p>https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200422/most-covid-19-patients-placed-on-ventilators-died-new-york-study-shows#1</p>
<p>But I found a more reputable source refuting this:</p>
<p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ventilators-killing-covid-patients/2021/03/15/7115e4e8-7611-11eb-9489-8f7dacd51e75_story.html</p>
<p>&rt;we live now in a doctatorship, where white lab coats do what any hammer does - treat every problem as though it's a nail</p>
<p>these guys are literally the experts on this lol. dont you want the experts creating a solution to this problem instead of like politicians and stuff?</p>
<p>&rt;Fauci expressly admitted this only a few days ago during his testimony to Congress</p>
<p>I don't have a link for this, but people make mistakes. they told us not to wear masks at first, then backtracked on that very hard and they still dont know what the hell is going to happen in the Fall, but we're all working together. Maybe more economists should come to the table to weight in as it seems that there's a balance to be made to this issue.</p>
<p>&rt;death tolls are now FAMOUSLY embellished</p>
<p>Ah, sorry, I couldn't find any information on this. Lmk if you find something.</p>
<p>&rt;We go out, we party, drink, dine out, shop, whatever. It's fine. We're moving past the fear and the lies, and we're happier for it.</p>
<p>You might end up fine, but (if you believe the media/science) you're extending the length of this virus by helping transmitting it, which is in turn killing more people. I admit the NY age distribution initially shocked me, like why am I spending all my time locked up in my house when I have such a small chance of actually dying, but if I went out and lived my life as normal, I could bring the virus back home to my family and not even know it.</p>

        <p>Washington Post is pure propaganda. Ventilators killed people. This is well understood in the medical community, whether it's been widely reported in the press or not. I literally got into an argument with a surgeon friend of mine about this months ago. She didn't believe me. A month later, the hospital totally reversed their policies on ventilators and saved lives. She believes me now. That hospital was behind the current standard of care. Not everything that's timely or true will be reported by the press. </p>
<p>On experts: keep in mind they view things through a very narrow lense. They are not considering the long-term consequences of giving executive powers the sole authority to lockdown an economy. They are not worried about emotional well being, or losses to education, or jobs. They are solely focused on quashing a disease that Fauci has already admitted is endemic. It is never going away. There will never be a point when it's ok in his mind to lift these restrictions. Listen to experts, but always take into account a broad range of considerations.</p>
<p>On the death tolls, people have been tracking this since the start of the pandemic. You won't find a mainstream media source on it, because it doesn't support the narrative that Trump was killing grandmothers.</p>
<p>On extending the life of the virus - how do you think previous pandemics ended? They ran their course. Human immune systems adapted. Diseases predate vaccines by a long, long time. We adapt to them, and it's better that way.</p>
<p>By the way, we've been sold a lie. We're told that vaccines are the only way out of this. No, they're not. Like I keep saying, standard of care is way beyond where it was a year ago. Maybe not all over the world. But it definitely is here in the US.</p>
<p>You're going to be fine if you leave the house. Or maybe you won't. Maybe you'll get hit by a car, or you'll get cancer, or you'll die of literally anything at all. Your time is precious, and it's far better spent with a little risk involved so you can be with people you love.</p>

<p>I think there are a lot of experts thinking about this. You can disagree with the balance on this, but it should be a balance (of lockdown/returning to normal).</p>
<p>&rt;On extending the life of the virus - how do you think previous pandemics ended? They ran their course. Human immune systems adapted. Diseases predate vaccines by a long, long time. We adapt to them, and it's better that way.</p>
<p>So, this statement I think is about herd immunity. The idea of the vaccine is that you can gain immunity w/o being infectious. Also, it prevents the chance of death while becoming immune, which is great for older people especially. We do gain immunity w/o a vaccine, but it comes with the downside of infection and death.</p>
<p>&rt;You're going to be fine if you leave the house. Or maybe you won't. Maybe you'll get hit by a car, or you'll get cancer, or you'll die of literally anything at all. Your time is precious, and it's far better spent with a little risk involved so you can be with people you love.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, you're trading a year plus for a chance of more years with the people you love. Is this worth it? It looks like the death rate for the elderly (one contracted) is like 1-2%</p>
<p>https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/09/26/what-is-the-death-rate-for-covid-19-coronavirus-what-this-study-found/?sh=5c9168065c46</p>
<p>So, in the worst case if your family members are age 60 (that was the cutoff in the link above), they have about 20 years left. So, you're trading 5% of their life (a year) verses the case where they contract the disease where you lose an average (20*.015) 0.3 years of their life. I guess that's a bad trade? Maybe that's not the best way to argue this I guess. Idk, im just crunching numbers here lol.</p>
<p>So, I guess you're not doing it for yourself, you have to stay in lockdown so that other people can stay alive.</p>

        <p>1% is the average for everybody. Making it the death rate:/ But that 0.04 number isnt correct. I dont know your age but the lowest death rate is for 1 year olds at 0.1%. And people 85+ have a 10% chance of dying. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html</a> And thank god that your death rate in your county is lower, most likely because most people in your age group have been doing a much better job at following restrictions than you.</p>
<p>Yes we are running out of hospital capacity, you are just too sheltered to see it. here in Ontario our third wave is getting really bad, if you don't have a 70% chance of surviving you will be left to die so someone else can have your hospital bed. This isn't a matter of adjusting, they've adjusted as much as they can. They can only handle so many covid patients. And you saying hospitals sat empty all year is just a straight up lie. Lets fact check this. Back in November <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/21/21588959/hhs-report-coronavirus-cases-surge-hospital-staff-overwhelmed">seven states report shortages in 30 percent or more of their hospitals.</a> Actually you can just go check yourself over <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/hospital-facilities#-110.23899006754499,30.65359343112587,4.373356736713964">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/how-do-we-know-the-covid-vaccine-wont-have-long-term-side-effects-155714">Long term affects appear within the first few months of a vaccine.</a> (Our vaccines have been tested for many months)</p>
<p>Ok and what about other people? What about students that want to go to school? What about small businesses that keep having to closing? What about everyone who is suffering with bad mental health because of lockdowns? What about everyone who dies but can't have a funeral? I don't give a shit that you're not scared of covid. You are not the only person in existence. I can't tell if you genuinely think that I am enjoying this pandemic or not. Because surprise, I don't. I hate this as much as you do. And you are a small percentage of people out there when you act like this. So that means natural herd immunity is much father away than you think. And to reach that goal would take a very long time, since we can't expose everyone at once without overwhelming hospitals. So we would have to expose small groups of people at a a time. And it wouldn't be as effective compared to vaccines with their efficiency rates. So stop being scared of a needle.</p>

        <p>Your lot are the ones closing schools, driving small businesses into bankruptcy, and destroying mental health the world over. We’ve always seen that the cure was worse than the disease. You did not. Whether that was cowardice or blind obedience on your part is up to you, but don’t you dare try to flip the narrative now that you see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

        <p>If the vaccines are safe, why have the manufacturers gone through so much trouble to acquire legal immunity from damages caused by the vaccine? </p>
<p>Is it maybe because, if you are a company like Pfizer or J&amp;J, you have already had to pay billions of dollars in previous lawsuits?</p>
<p>Or maybe, if you're more like Moderna, because you've never successfully released a vaccine before and this is your first time ever doing it?</p>
<p>Or maybe it's because if you are like Moderna or Pfizer, you are using a new mRNA based technology that has never been publicly used before?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, why has Pfizer asked various countries to put their national assets, including embassy buildings, military bases, and federal reserves as collateral for lawsuits over vaccine injuries?</p>
<p>Is it because Pfizer is sure their vaccines will not result in injury lawsuits? And because they are here for the good of humanity, and have no interest in acquiring the military bases, embassy buildings, and federal reserves of several of the world's countries?</p>
<p>If you got the Pfizer vaccine, you just might be helping Pfizer acquire the military bases of several nations. Trust the $cience!</p>

        <p>Did you not hear your lord and savior Fraudchi say that even if you got the vaccine that you still could get the Covid virus? So if you can still get the virus even if your vaccinated then you can still pass it on to the next vaccinated clown plus you still need to wear a fucking mask and social distance. You fucking schills are too stupid to think for yourself. I seriously hope y'all covid idiots get what you deserve when the experimental vaccine fucks up your body years down the road. I'll have zero empathy for y'all dumb asses.</p>

        <p>I absolutely hate Trevor Noah. The way he talks is so patronizing. Whenever I try to watch South Park on Comedy Central to take my mind off of everything, every other ad is him reminding me that I should be afraid and social distance. Simply hearing his voice is enough to make me want to punch a hole through the TV.</p>

        <p>I should've clarified that I watch CLASSIC south park, meaning season 18 and older. It's not that I necessarily disagree with some of the stuff said in seasons 19-23, it's just that recent politics of any nature stress me out. Also, I didn't think the latest episode was that bad considering at the end everything went back to normal (and Garrison came back lol). It actually kinda gave me hope. I had to sit out while the rest of my family watched the first special though because I knew that shit would give me a panic attack (and It did when I eventually said "fuck it" and watched it myself). Everything was just way too raw at that point. Sorry for my rant lmao.</p>

They will shill anything, and comply with any narrative, just to get theirs. They hate middle america, Christians, and generally anyone who isn't one of them.

        <p>One day you will wake up in a dystopia you hate because you went along with the insidious changes that lead there.  One day you will realise hugging your loved ones will never be legal again, because you failed to see the bigger picture.  One day everything you love will either be gone, or so heavily monitored that it becomes too uncomfortable to bother with.  Unless people rise up and stop this tyranny.  That’s why we’re here.</p>
<p>You’re clearly lucky enough to not have lost anyone to a lockdown related suicide, or to cancer that could have been diagnosed sooner if not for lockdowns, or to starvation, or to alcoholism, or to overdose, or to any of the other shit lockdowns have brought about.  You think this is about protecting people?  What a JOKE</p>

        <p>Why are you kidding yourself into thinking lockdowns work?  There is no correlation between harsher restrictions and less covid deaths.  All the lockdowns are doing is destroying everyone’s life.  This isn’t about a lack of sympathy for those who died from the virus.  This is about the truth.  You can throw around all the angry words you like, the insults, the f-bombs, but all you’re really doing is running away.  You’ve split the world into black and white because that’s nice and easy for you - good, obedient people like you, and evil misanthropists who want everyone to die from a virus.  That’s so easy, but it is not in any way true.  But you go on, keep running away, keep screaming into your echo chamber about the Evil People who want the Good People to all die, don’t bother considering any other narrative, and shut your ears to how utterly ridiculous you sound.  Bye!</p>
