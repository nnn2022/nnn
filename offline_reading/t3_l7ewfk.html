        <p>In some ways it makes more sense because you’re not supposed to touch your face covering without washing your hands so these people are doing it right if they put it on to go to the grocery store and then they’re not taking it off till they get home so they can wash their hands first before they touch it. it’s the people who go to the restaurant and put it on and put it off to get down to their table and put it on to go to the bar and put it on and off again, or like Gavin Gruesome said “between bites,“ never getting up to wash their hands, these are the people who are wearing it wrong and that’s most people.</p>
