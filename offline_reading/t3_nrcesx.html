        <p>On March 8th 2020, Fauci gave the 60 Minutes interview saying masks won't work and give a false sense of protection. This was shared here so often I can just about quote it word for word, but people still don't believe it. If a prime time news interview catching him on the record saying this won't sway people, I doubt an email will.</p>

        <p>He is a physician and he can’t push an unapproved treatment or supplement.  Him telling the world he is taking it is about as strong of a recommendation that he is allowed to do.</p>

<p>Can't say vitamins are healthy but can push an experimental injection. </p>
<p>Your logic doesn't make sense </p>

<p>Neither is a mask or experimental injection</p>

<p>That's not what the CDC does. I can tell you've never visited the CDC website.  Feel free to show me where the cdc says people should supplement vitamins and lose weight</p>

        <p>I remember when it was <em>"You don't need a mask for COVID".</em></p>
<p>Then that became <em>"Okay, you do need a mask, I only lied so medical personnel could stock up on masks."</em></p>
<p>Then that turned into <em>"Actually you should wear multiple masks."</em></p>
<p>But now it turns out we didn't need masks, and as we suspected it was all just a power-trip the whole time.</p>

        <p>This headline is misleading. Masks are an effective way to reduce pre-symptomatic transmission.<br>
Before it was understood that the virus can be spread by people before they show symptoms, Facui told a coworker not to wear a cloth mask because they protect people around the masker, not the masker themselves.<br>
Once it was understood that the virus could be spread pre-symptomatically, the CDC told people to use cloth masks, because it would protect the people around a masker if the masker was pre-symptomatic</p>

<p>The full email that Dr Bostom left off says:</p>
<p>&rt;Bottom line: generally there were not differences in Ill/URI/or flu rates when masks were used, although when early use and compliance was taken into account, a few times a difference was seen.<br>
In addition:<br>
This case control study noted that, among SARS patients in Hong Kong without a known source of infection, cases {27.9%) were less likely than uninfected controls {58.7%) to report wearing a mask frequently in public , for what that's worth.</p>
<p>My interpretation is: Masks might not have a big impact on transmission, for any effect to be seen people need to wear masks pro-actively and consistently. Additionally, during the SARS outbreak, people who got sick were less likely to have been maskers.<br>
All this seems to support having the public proactively wear masks to reduce pre-symptomatic spread, and reinforce the idea that masks alone are insufficient so social distancing and limiting gatherings should also be recommended.</p>

        <p>It also links to a cdc paper:</p>
<p>&rt; In this review, we did not find evidence to support a protective effect of personal protective measures or environmental measures in reducing influenza transmission. Although these measures have mechanistic support based on our knowledge of how influenza is transmitted from person to person, randomized trials of hand hygiene and face masks have not demonstrated protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza, with 1 exception (18).</p>
<p>&rt; ...</p>
<p>&rt; We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility (Figure 2)</p>
<p>And MIT has blown the social distancing argument out of the water.  6 ft or 60 indoors makes no difference.  I think the reopenings of states across the country and a complete lack of impact on cases, either before or after the vaccine, should put a damper on any pro-lockdown gathering limitation enthusiasm.  There's simply no evidence that these have a positive impact at all, much less an impact that offsets the horrific downsides.</p>

        <p>Ah, I hadn't gone back to the emails, I was looking at the Doctor's cdc link, which at least explains that discrepancy.  </p>
<p>One does wonder whether the increase in masks, handwashing, and disinfection, all with similar reported efficacy, all timed with seasonal decreases in all respiratory diseases, might be a significant conflating factor.  We have ample studies showing fomites aren't a significant source of transmission of coronaviruses, yet surface disinfection seems to be as useful as masks.</p>
<p>This does continue the downward enthusiasm for distancing however:</p>
<p>&rt; Evidence does not indicate that frequent visits to crowded places were associated with a higher likelihood of community-acquired infection. This finding may remove panic that arose during the epidemic, and daily life need not change as much as it had. 
&rt; ...</p>
<p>&rt; the other five variables (visiting crowded places, having contact with someone with influenzalike symptoms, having social contact with hospital visitors, having social contact with medical workers, and living with in the same housing estate as other SARS case-patients) were not significant risk factors.</p>
<p>Actually, if social interaction isn't a risk factor, what exactly are masks mitigating?  Similarly if living in the same housing state isn't a risk factor, what does cleaning mitigate?  What exactly is being measured here...</p>

        <p>Pre-symptomatic transmission is statistically negligible and the measures are absolutely unreasonable basing them on risk-cost.      </p>
<p>The pre-symptomatic stage lasts around 12-24 hours in which you'd gradually start feeling unwell.    </p>
<p>That means, if I had 100% guaranteed I'll get infected and develop symptoms in 2021, there's from 1/365- to 1/730 chances any day for me to hit the jackpot.     </p>
<p>Even doing it, I'm at zero risk of dying and would only put at risk a very specific demographic which could make sense to have some measures around. </p>
<p>Locking down, destroying economies and sempiternal masking is a disproportionate decision based on pre-symptomatic transmission.    </p>
