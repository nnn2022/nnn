    <strong>“Social Distancing” as a continuation of recent trends</strong>
    <p><p>This idea I’ve been thinking about would require a bit more research (and a less biased media) to substantiate fully, but bear with me...</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking, lately, about how “social distancing”, as a concept and a “rule” forced upon us, could only possibly exist in this century, and maybe even this decade...</p>
<p>There’s a few reasons for this. Number one - our reliance on the internet. Theoretically, at least, in terms of “making money”, and spending it, so much of what we do now can be conducted online...
It shouldn’t be,and it’s utterly ineffective for some things that it is being forcibly used for, atm, but it is. Hence “work from home”, “we’re all in this together”, and all the bullshit of forcing us towards Zoom, Teams, etc...</p>
<p>Secondly, and maybe more importantly (and related), you have the atomisation of society. This has been going on for half a century, and it keeps getting worse.</p>
<p>I barely know my neighbours. I hardly know anyone in my street. I’m not part of any “teams”, and I know I’m not alone in this... Millennials, allegedly, would rather stay home with their Netflix, than go out ANYWHERE and be sociable or active... Truly active.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and most controversially, I think it’s our fear of other people, of strangers, and of physical touch. People are “germy” and “dirty”, but it’s more than that... As a male, you have sexual harassment allegations to worry about. Anything can be misconstrued. Anything can be taken out of context. Anything can be weaponised...
Sure, it’s important that we believe women, and respect personal space, but that... Fear, in bars, in public places, in the workplace... The fear of hugging people. The fear of... Even being alone together in a room, in some cases. And of course the (perhaps justified) fear that any stranger may do you, or mean you, harm... That’s not healthy, and, controversially, I believe that fed into this...</p>
<p>There’s more, of course. A very compliant, partisan, biased and authoritarian media. Social media. Mass panic. Corporatism. Politics. The privatisation of public space (a big one). The idea that everything must cost, and make, money for someone. The “need” (massive in Australia) to “save lives”, and “protect health”, and, quite literally, to “prevent” death, at all costs to society, and freedom...
Even Davos and “the great reset”. But I wanted to draw attention to those particular things, and how they feed into all this. At least where I live right now. 😞</p></p>

        <p>They need you to be distanced in order to fear your fellow man and not trust him, and only trust the tyrants who bark orders at you. </p>
<p>Also, they need you to not get in contact to discuss the tyranny and disgusting overreach of power by the CCP funded dogs shit governments in the West. </p>
<p>Imagine a bunch of angry pissed off men sitting around thanksgiving having a few beers talking about the BS. We would actually revolt! They don’t want that. Stay a good little sheep and put on your shit-rag of a mask, stay in your little house and we’ll Uber food for you with that $600 Cheque. Need stuff? Buy if online (how you’ll be funding China anyways)</p>

        <p>Yup. Though weirdly I got to see my extended family over Christmas, in groups (including a bunch of pissed-off, grumpy men, lol...), and most of them were very compliant, very... Fearful, and parroting the government/media line on everything...
We don’t do Thanksgiving here, of course, so that’s about as close as I get, lol...
But yeah, the most disconcerting thing was not so much hearing “the olds” supporting it all (vested interests, arguably...), but the kids, who seemed genuinely fearful, and seemed to believe everything their parents, and the media, threw at them...</p>
<p>To hear my 12ish year old cousin hyperbolising the virus, and believing it was EVEN WORSE than what we generally hear in the media, here..? That was scary, and honestly sad. 😞</p>

        <p>Social distancing has happened way before 2020.</p>
<p>All these families together at the restaurant staring at their own screen and not talking to each other.</p>
<p>Sharing pictures on the web instead of talking to your friends.</p>
<p>Not asking your friends how they've been because you know all thats been happening with them by looking at your profile.</p>
<p>Not having solid conversations in person because you can easily insult one another on the intenet.</p>
<p>People spending all time alone in their house because internet access, and being manipulated by the content you see on social media, whether is fake empowerment or having depression being cool and edgy. or fake wokeness.  </p>
<p>Couples fighting and being jealous over facebook 'likes'  </p>
<p>People were already more distanced than ever before 2020, so they didnt have a hard time accepting this new measures in place.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's an accident that ALL social trends are toward atomizing and isolating people in all contexts except politics, and atomized/isolated people are the easiest to control. This is a trend that is across the board beneficial to the wealthy and powerful.</p>

        <p>I’ve been thinking what would of happened If this “pandemic” happened around 1990-2000 where technology couldn’t support widespread video conferencing and all this virtual shit. All of the office workers would have been back to their offices in less than a month.  No Netflix , Uber eats.  Would have been over fast.</p>

        <p>You can still phone in pizzas...<br>
In the 90ies, most office drones were superfluous. Reordering and restructuring happened with the Internet. Maybe they noticed after half a year that most stayed home lol</p>

        <p>And yet I know first hand of tightly knit groups of about 12 to 20 who meet regularly, even form some kind of relationships (there's definitely stuff going on...) over longer periods of time. They met this year regularly. The more they cried foul on the Internet for those with a social life, the more these rather introverted met irl.<br>
I guess this happens all over the world. Sadly, this also means a strong stratification of society, since the randomness of festivals or cultural mass gatherings doesn't happen.</p>
