    <strong>Anyone notice how transparent the lies are becoming?</strong>
    <p><p>Feels like in 2020 they put more effort into hiding their true agenda, but now in 2021, we've got Hancock openly being a hypocrite (before being replaced by sajid javid in the UK), then the G7 Summit where the elites openly laughed at the public by "social distancing" on the camera, then once the cameras were off, they immediately went back to normal (even if they were vaccinated, apparently there are still rules like hotel quarantine for some places, but apparently they broke all of their own rules)</p>
<p>Then Australian news openly said "New World Order" without even caring: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ohnhyz/today_is_the_first_full_day_of_the_new_world/</p>
<p>"The Great Reset" has even been mentioned in mainstream media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcAO4-o_4Ug</p>
<p>Which means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Their Endgame is near, and they have no use to hide anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They realized that they don't have to hide it. Even when they've been openly talking about "The New World Order" apparently the public is too dumb to realize something is wrong and still think all of this is about health. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I honestly think that even the corrupt politicians were surprised and didn't expect how easy it was to fool the public, so they're being more careless now?</p></p>

        <p>It has become so obvious.</p>
<p>Notice how nobody knows the "numbers" anymore.  People now just talk in generalities: "Australia had to go into lockdown again", "Japan has low vaccination rates and that's why numbers are going back up", "we need to hurry to get vaccinated in other to stop the ~~fourth~~, ~~fifth~~, sixth wave".</p>
<p>They are arguing with feelings, not actual stats or logic.</p>

        <p>They've never hidden their desire for a "new world order". They call themselves globalists after all. They want a one world government, we know that.</p>
<p>As for the "Great Reset", that's just communists, like Trudeau, saying the quiet part out loud. No big surprise there either.</p>
<p>The modern left is fully on board with turning the West into modern-day China. It's not a conspiracy, they openly and unapologetically want selective property rights, social credit systems, and one party rule.</p>

        <p>The crazy thing is that the MSM is just showing the 'off camera' stuff openly now. Before, MSM was 100% under orders to never make the 'rulers' look bad, now those orders are off &amp; the 'rulers' are open about "Fuck you! We are above all laws!"</p>

        <p>Exactly. I didn't think they'd be as open as they are now. At least in 2020 I could somewhat tell they were at least putting effort into not appearing like hypocrites, but in 2021? Nah the mask (pun intended) is off.</p>

        <p>I have a feeling they are going to push, and push, and push until there is a collective outrage. That by the end --- the people who got the vax AND those of us who don't want it forced on us will be so collectively upset that "down goes the system."</p>
<p>And as "this" system goes down, they have another one in its place.</p>
<p>The timing of this will be combined with the bursting of the bubble-of-all-bubbles which we are clearly in, now.</p>
<p>Another possibility is a virus deliberately released at the height of the mass protests which infects people who had the mRNA vaccines. (It could be a virus that infects thanks to the spike proteins in the vaccinated, or it could be pathogenic priming over-responding to a future iteration of the virus. Either way, same result.)</p>
<p>You may have noticed that the people who are now pushing "BLM" and militant about the vaccines are the same people that would have been out protesting at Occupy rallies around 2008 era.</p>
<p>So if the latter possibility comes to fruition, the virus would target the people most likely to protest about financial corruption.</p>
<p>Before you say "get out of here with the dumb conspiracy theories" take a look at the last year, and take a look now at the rollout of Covid-19 passports and people losing their jobs over vaccination requirements and systemwide censorship --- <em>then</em> tell me I'm crazy to consider this one possible outcome for the future.</p>
