    <strong>Therapeutics questions</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone know what therapeutics they are using for patients with covid prior to ventilation? I know in my state,  the drugs Trump had suggested early on are banned for use for covid. Is covid-19 resistant to steroids? Trump took dexamethasone(with other treatments, i believe).I know people that have had it and recovered at home, a couple of them were prescribed albuterol inhalers and  benzonatate (pill for dry cough). I've been on dexamethasone and prednisone for respiratory illness before.
I haven't heard much about any other therapeutics they are using on hospitalized covid patients. Does anyone here have any experience or knowledge?</p></p>
