    <strong>I want to thank the creators of this sub.</strong>
    <p><p>I used to be a long time lurker on reddit but this sub encouraged me to make an account so I could comment and post. </p>
<p>I'm not a supporter of trump or biden. Both political parties have failed us. It's not a matter of left vs right. We both have the same enemy and the sooner most people wake up the better. </p>
<p>According to the pro communist rona karen introverts we are conspiracy theorists that spread conspiracies. </p>
<p>So now let's talk about some science. </p>
<p>I caught covid around Christmas before last. How do I know? I usually get the flu every year around Christmas time which I did and recovered from it within no time. After I recovered I got what I thought was the flu again but this time I lost smell and taste and breathing was difficult. It took me a month to get over it but after that I was fine. </p>
<p>I have a friend who didn't have covid and got the vaccine a few weeks ago and told we should get a test to compare antibodies. The results were surprising. </p>
<p>I still have triple the amount antibodies than my friend has after both vaccine shots. How come nobody wants to talk about that?</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not denying the existence of the virus. But I firmly believe this was a test by powerful people to see how compliant humans would be. A very slippery slope.</p></p>

        <p>This was actually just brought up on Tucker Carlson.  People with natural antibodies are much more protected than people who got the vaccine so treating people who already have antibodies but no vaccine  like leapers  is against science and logic.</p>

        <p>I am very grateful for this place as well! I think there are just so many things going on that are not being shared with us, not being explained, not being acknowledged and not being studied., it seems like every time you do hear about something that paints the vaccine in a bad light It's Quickly censored or silenced and whoever is talking about it as written off as a nut case. I do believe that a lot is going to be revealed eventually. People are going to look back on this and be absolutely horrified at what we have been subjected to as well as their own behavior.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's SARS and coronaviruses are known as common cold viruses. But this one has a very toxic glycoprotein in its spikes, which seems to cause all sorts of blood disorders. And while pathology remains scientifically mostly unknown, we already seem to have these gene therapies available, only to have this hemotoxic viral glycoprotein reproduced by ones own cells. It should be no surprise that side effects are exactly symptoms of covid and cause adverse and possibly lethal reactions (such as thrombocytopenia).</p>
<p>Those adverse side effects are actually known by now. But seeing how everyone is extorted to be injected with these literal experimental synthetics, for this mostly unknown pathology, the question remains what it does which is not known. As everyone is coerced in taking this shot, which doesn't prevent infection nor transmission yet drives viral mutation through immune escape and viral environmental adaptation (wrongfully blaming the unvaxxed as source of mutations), while healthy people under 55 have minimal risk of dieing from covid anyway, you can bet your ass there is a hidden agenda.</p>

        <p>I think I knew all this, but you summarized it well. C19 is basically a Frankenstein virus combining the spike protein with the original SARS template. If only we could explain how it originated so close to a lab explicitly doing this kind of gain-of-function research. 🤔</p>

        <p>Rona was a light 2 day cold for me. Would have gone to work and played in sports games with it if covid wasn't a thing. No way in hell I need some vaccine. Give me covid with any "variant" once a year for all I care. Give it once a month. Doesn't affect me</p>

        <p>Number of Antibodies means nothing. He could be more protected than you with less.
I can't really imagine this being a "test" if the hospitals are full of Corona ill. Young people like you and me are going to survive it no problem, but my grandmother could go to a hospital.
Think critical but you will come to the same results as nearly all governments.
Tbh I really don't hope we go back to a new normal. The pandemic also brought new great things. Homeoffice, hopefully sick people continue to wear mask in public spaces like in Asia (I wasn't ill in a year), why do you have to give handshakes? I feel better without it. Generally people giving each other more space in public places.</p>

        <p>People who got the virus and developed antibodies are more more protectant against reinfection than people who got the vaccine.  The vaccine is just part of the virus and your body likely doesn't identify it as a huge threat.   People who had the 1917 flu still had a strong immune response 70 years later.</p>

<p>You've been watching too much news.</p>
<p>To your sad point
&rt;really don't hope we go back to a new normal</p>
<p>If you want to hide in your house and not shake people's hands and wear a mask and watch the news and cry then do it! But how selfish of you to want society to conform everyone to your weak whims! Attitudes like yours are the saddest thing to come out of the last year.</p>
