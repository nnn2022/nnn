    <strong>I expect people who protest pro-corona measures to be adequately informed about the world economic forum and their goals</strong>
    <p><p>Why is it that we see people who are most of the time still 'good' people with signs and banners promoting the corona measures but not things like 'you will own nothing and you will be happy'.
'Fourth industrial revolution ftw!'
'Speed up the mass survailance'
'Trust in big companies who also had some scandals here and there, but they're going to help us now!!'
And just fill it in for yourselves what other text.</p>
<p>It amazes me how many people only go for social justice in this on a surface level.
The leaders they trust in are only interesting because they are relevant in the p(l)andemic and they are automaticlly supporting shit they don't even know about.
'Well just trust the WHO, don't ask who works there and who they are partnered with'.</p>
<p>People who wanna agree with corona measures and promote them? Fine but do it in your own way and not give the world economic forum free energy and then later complain when the 4th industrial revolution robot-doctor is on your doorstep to inspect your carbon footprint reducing headband and take your sweat measurements in the new weird normal coming up.</p>
<p>It is crazy to me how people nowadays need big organizations to support their opinions.
Where are the good old days that the majority of people stood up for themselves and had an opinion that was strong, and I will always try to respect such people even if I disagree with what they stand for.</p></p>

        <p>unless it’s blatantly in their face, being regurgitated over and over and over, they think it’s a conspiracy. they can’t think for themselves or form an original thought. soon enough the “you will own nothing and you will be happy” bullshit will be mainstream and they’ll recite this like a cult as well</p>

        <p>IMO something just happened information-wise and the public is being left in the dark</p>
<p>This urgent shift. Fox and gop suddenly pushing the vax. Sure the dow jones blah blah but its something else. Like say, they know its a bio weapon now. Can't alarm the masses right right, yet now magically its a so urgent we vax. This world is just getting weirder by the day</p>
