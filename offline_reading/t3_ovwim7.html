    <p><p>I am about to burst. I‚Äôve been attempting to legally battle my university all summer over rejecting all medical and religious exemptions sent their way. I watched the mental health of my friends and myself absolutely deteriorate all summer. On Friday, my university announced that they would be unenrolling all students who are not vaccinated, REGARDLESS of if they are an online student or not. When you go to my university‚Äôs health center website, ‚ÄúMental health workshop!‚Äù ‚ÄúMental health support for BIPOC and LGBT students‚Äù ‚Äúanimal yoga therapy in the quad!‚Äù. What about MY mental health? What about the mental health of students like me? One of my friends caved because her parents wouldn‚Äôt allow her to drop out and quite literally threatened to disown her. She‚Äôs been deep in depression ever since, and I‚Äôm very, very worried about her. But nobody else is. I hate this world so much. I have a pre-existing mental health condition that is exacerbated by stress. I‚Äôve been out of my mind all week, but can‚Äôt call my doctor because if I told her what triggered it, she‚Äôd put me on anti-psychotics or commit me to a hospital for being a ‚Äúparanoid‚Äù lunatic. What a cruel, sick world.</p></p>

        <p>This is just wrong, and I'm sorry it's happening. It's going to be a detour for you, but I'm confident you will work it out for the best. Just keep taking the steps you know are right for you and hang in there. I have no doubt you'll finish the degree, but along the path please remember that the degree isn't everything. So much stress comes from over identifying with it and that is terrible for our mental health. Sending a hug!</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm going to CC for another semester and I have a choice to either transfer or just drop out. What‚Äôs sad is I didn‚Äôt know alot of the in state schools I was planning to transfer to require the shots, even though they aren‚Äôt FDA approved. I find this hard to believe they are pushing it with only 50% of the population fully vaxxed and vaccinated individuals are spreading it. I‚Äôm thinking I might have to find alternate ways to live‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just not sure what yet since Im still kinda young</p>

        <p>Hey I'm in the same predicament, I'm at the end of my summer semester and feel like I'm wasting my time and money, might transfer and move, might just drop out and try to make it some other way- brainstorm alternate ways to live with me if you want! </p>
<p>I know some unis that have significantly reduced or dropped covid restrictions too if you want (only in the west though, I'm from the western US and want to stay in WUE areas.)</p>
<p>You can also view a map of schools requiring vaccination <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/live-coronavirus-updates/heres-a-list-of-colleges-that-will-require-students-to-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19?bc_nonce=70nn57oya9wevwfoat00wn&amp;cid=reg_wall_signup">here</a>! Good luck dude.</p>

        <p>Spent all summer doing that. My university is violating law after law. They denied my medical exemption, which came from my doctor and talked about how if I get this vaccine, it could very well kill me due to a condition I have. They denied many other medical exemptions as well. The law means absolutely nothing at this point</p>
