    <strong>Death panels coming to Ontario?</strong>
    <p><p>So it has come to this. Over a glorified flu. "Ethicist" is such an Orwellian word these days.</p>
<p>Nice to see they want to take the important things into account, like this...</p>
<p>&rt; <em>The goal is to minimize deaths, minimize the risk of discrimination and  “unconscious bias” against people with disabilities, racialized  communities and other vulnerable groups, and minimize “moral injury and  burnout” among staff forced to decide who may live and who may die.</em> </p>
<p>So make sure the death panel members don't feel guilty, and make sure the death rate doesn't look racist?</p>
<p>Socialist "healthcare" objectives at their finest!</p>

        <p>To not be racist all you have to do is not include skin color on the medical charts. It's that easy.</p>

        <p>This article is about nothing. Nobody ever ends up having to ration care, so these hypothetical injustices don't happen.</p>
<p>Its just an excuse to keep building the mythology of the pandemic.</p>

        <p>It's a great way to condition the public to the idea of rationing care based on cost, though.</p>
<p>And to give doctors and health bureaucrats less accountability and more power, at the expense of loved ones and patients.</p>
<p>To see where this leads, think about how things have gone with teachers, parents, and school boards. At one time, teachers were afraid of parents, who could get them fired. Now parents are afraid of teachers - who can have the government take their children away.</p>

        <p>The same way they have organ donation registry in Ontario, I'd be happy to put myself on a 'excluded list' for covid in exchange for them just leaving me the hell alone to live my life.</p>

        <p>I agree with you that this is od but obligatory because it was pointed out to me we are not a socialist nation atleast not the Marxist definition of socialism</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Socialism:</strong> An umbrella term used to describe social ownership of the means of production. Social ownership can include common ownership, state ownership or collective ownership. "Socialism" can also refer to an intermediate and transitional form of society between capitalism and communism featuring a Dictatorship of the Proletariat (sometimes referred to as "lower" or "the first phase of" communism).  Keep in mind this means dictatorship for the proliferate not the gorgeous </p>
<p>WHen i asked socialists if Canada was a socialist nation on /r/socailsism they told me we are welfare capitalists keep take that how you will.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Although I see your point about our public health insurance being socialist in nature even if we are still a capitalist society(one of the reasons police don't care about the charter not all but some not@poliuceongaurdforthee)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>one more thing this is a quote from George Orwell you know everyone loves 1984 in this sub but does everyone know Eric was a police officer in his early life in berma also this is a good quote from him</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When one came (to Barcelona) straight from England the aspect of Barcelona was somewhat startling and overwhelming. It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle……. In outward appearance, it was a town in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to exist. Except for a small number of women and foreigners, there were no ’well-dressed’ people at all. Practically everyone wore rough working-class clothes, or blue overalls, or some variant of the militia uniform. All this was queer and moving. There was much in it that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for”."</p>
