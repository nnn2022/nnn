    <strong>Just a JD here to tell you guys not to fall for the DOJs statement as if they have any authority on the matter...</strong>
    <p><p>So the DOJ came out today “announcing” that mandates would be legal. Just wanted you guys to know that them saying this has ZERO legal significance. The AG is the government’s attorney. They’re a political arm. It was meant to kick off a narrative to further coerce people into the clot shot and give the employers and schools another bullet in their arsenal to further pressure people into it. </p>
<p>Just wanted to share my info as I am currently sitting for the bar exam and so it made me furious to see that yesterday knowing that the average person wouldn’t know that the DOJ giving an advisory opinion means jack shit. </p>
<p>That is all folks</p></p>

<p>Good luck. The exam feels way harder than it actually is; I walked out certain that I failed it, and I passed by a very generous margin (some states don't disclose your score if you pass, but MBE states do given the score portability it is intended to offer).</p>

        <p>Also a retired JD here and I want to tell people that if you are fired for not taking the shot, contact an attorney. They have no right to coerce you into taking an experimental shot ! This is not a vaccine in is an experimental gene therapy which has not been adjudicated by SCOTUS as have most vaccines !</p>

        <p>What is the best way to fight this creeping end of medical privacy, for example an airline asking for proof of vaccination to board a flight. Do you refuse to divulge on medical privacy grounds, insist on your right to board, allow them to call the police and get arrested while recording everything, then contact a lawyer? Should you have your lawyer on the phone while boarding the flight? Any thoughts you could give on the matter would be welcome.</p>

        <p>I was hearing that with the case of the Houston hospital group that was trying to sue for that exact cause that SCOTUS refused to hear the case and that they said private businesses have the right to make those sort of demands of their employees. Haven’t researched it yet but I hope that isn’t true. Really limits options if you need to keep your job.</p>

        <p>I doubt that to be the case as I doubt SCOTUS would have found any such case Ripe for hearing yet. They will most certainly let this rumble about in the lower courts and work its way up through normal channels before deciding if they'll hear it. And every case is a separate entity with it's own point and validations.</p>

        <p>&rt; exact cause that SCOTUS refused to hear the case </p>
<p>The federal DISTRICT court (the lowest level court) dismissed the suit. The rationale for dismissal is not what you've articulated, but rather that Texas law only allows for wrongful discharge claims (the cause of action alleged in the lawsuit) when the employer is engaging in illegal activity. As TX has no statute that bars employers from requiring vaccination as a condition of employment, the employer's conduct was not illegal. As such, the plaintiffs (the fired employees) failed to allege a proper cause of action, such that dismissal was legally proper. Their attorney has vowed to appeal to dismissal, which they can. And in theory, even appeals of procedural motions can be heard by SCOTUS. But even getting to that point is a long way off, and even if it did reach SCOTUS, and they granted cert (decided to hear it), and reversed whatever the appeals court decides in the interim, it would be remanded back down to the trial court for the trial court to hear the actual case. So, unfortunately, the absolute best case scenario is that the plaintiffs are vindicated 2-3 years from now, and that seems unlikely.</p>

        <p>With the necessary caveat that this is not legal advice, private employers <em>probably</em> can require it even without final FDA approval. This is a relatively unexplored area of law, and while there are lawyers like Robert Barnes who seem certain that lawsuits about pre-full approval will succeed, there isn't sufficient clear precedent that one ought to bank on it. Courts are often political, so you should expect them to side with employers and coerce vaccination.</p>

        <p>I'll copy my post from another comment of mine:</p>
<p>The DOJ doesn't determine this or have any authority whatsoever to assert it. The statement itself is a PR stunt trying to back some states and locals trying to force employees to get the injection. It holds no legal authority whatsoever. It's written in a way to get idiot journalist to print headlines "DOJ says mandates are legal!" and their lackeys in the corporate/state media print those headlines. There appears to be a current blitz of local and state governments and various corporations attempting to mandate the injection and giving people very short time periods to either refuse, deny, or "quit." It's obvious this is being coordinated.</p>
<p>The DOJ simply stipulates that because Section 564 of the FDCA does not mention anything about imposing vaccination requirements, therefore companies are able to do it, but their own footnote 3 discredits that claim:</p>
<p>&rt;"…you have asked whether the “option to accept or refuse” condition in section 564 prohibits entities from imposing such vaccination requirements while the only available vaccines for COVID-19 remain subject to EUAs. We conclude, consistent with FDA’s interpretation, that it does not. This language in section 564 specifies only that certain information be provided to potential vaccine recipients and does not prohibit entities from imposing vaccination requirements. [3]”</p>
<p>&rt;“[3] We do not address whether other federal, state, or local laws or regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), might restrict the ability of public or private entities to adopt particular vaccination policies. See, e.g., Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Laws (updated June 28, 2021), https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws (discussing the ADA).”</p>
<p>Oh? Those little things? Well okay. Idiotic Yahoo News is, as usual, lying to people and the DOJ is lying as well. "This one thing doesn't so it's totes okay and we don't take a position on any of the other relevant federal laws which likely prohibit various aspects of mandating injections"</p>
<p>On a sidenote, thank fuckin God this partisan lunatic Garland isn't sitting on the SCOTUS.</p>

        <p>As a lawyer, allow me to give you some insight as to why you're seeing relatively little litigation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generally speaking, you need to be licensed to practice in the jurisdiction where you're bringing suit. So, a Texas lawyer cannot represent clients in Michigan to challenge a bad law in Michigan. Suits against the federal government operate a little different, though there are logistical complications involved with complex federal litigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even supposing you're in the appropriate jurisdiction, most lawyers are not actually civil or appellate litigators. You don't want the guy who helps structure your trust handling this, much like you wouldn't want a liver transplant being handled by your podiatrist. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even assuming you have the right licensure and experience, litigation is extremely expensive. Lawyers cannot and should not go bankrupt doing public service work. Absent a source of funding, this is untenable. And most litigation, not least because of how sovereign immunity works, has little hope of a monetary award, since you rarely get to compel the government to pay for its crimes. That means even the litigation that will go forward is likely to be directed at private actors with deep pockets rather than the federal government. And in those cases, you'd need to show that the party being sued engaged in tortious conduct of their own accord, rather than as a quasi-governmental actor. That's hard to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Returning to the licensing bit in point 1, as the 2020 election litigation shows, state bars, all of which are run by leftists (yes, even if deep red states) are incredibly political and lawyers who challenge the status quo are liable to run into problems retaining their license. Nobody wants to give up their livelihood for one case, especially when that case is unlikely to be won.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given the degree to which courts are deferential to government generally, and overwhelmingly when it comes to questions of public health, even a strong claim by a competent attorney is unlikely to end in a favorable result. Even victory at the district court will almost certainly be overturned at the circuit court initially or upon en banc review, and then SCOTUS will punt, affirming the lower court verdict.</p>
</li>
</ol>
