    <strong>Social distancing makes less sense the more I think about it</strong>
    <p><p>Why should staying 6 feet away from non-sick people lower your risk of getting a virus? If you see someone who's clearly not sick, you're probably not putting yourself at any additional risk by going up and sitting next to them. Even if they are sick, unless they do something which will spread disease (sneeze/cough on you, etc.), staying an arbitrary distance away from them probably isn't going to lower your risk by much, especially considering how far viruses can travel with a sneeze or cough. Furthermore, moving away from someone who's clearly ill and sneezing or coughing isn't a new thing. Sick people generally don't go to restaurants, sporting events, or run errands they don't have to anyway. Additionally, people generally get sick because they expose their bloodstream to viruses, which usually happens through bodily openings (e.g. touching your face or mouth). Standing next to a healthy person isn't going to do this.</p></p>

        <p>The biggest mistake we made was treating healthy people as if they were sick. The second biggest mistake was not scrutinizing Covid test results to determine how many “asymptomatic” cases were in fact false positives.</p>

        <p>You can pretty much assume a priori that during any sort of asymptomatic incubation period for a virus that an individual is going to be at least several times less likely to transmit it compared to when they are symptomatic. This is simply how viruses are spread; they evolve to pass along to other individuals through your bodily reactions, e.g. coughing and sneezing. With COVID (and really any virus), most asymptomatic spread probably occurs through surfaces or other direct physical contact with viral matter, e.g. someone picks their nose, touches a handrail, someone else touches it, and they touch their face which gets them sick. There's simply no other way that a virus can efficiently get from one individual to another if they're not showing symptoms. Seeing as how <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4">COVID</a> doesn't spread all that much through surfaces to begin with, it's almost certain that the risk of asymptomatic spread has been disproportionately overblown, especially considering that we "still don't know much about it", even after a year and a half of this virus's existence.</p>

        <p>Yes? Sick people generally don't go out in public to begin with and when they do, it's pretty easy to identify them by their symptoms (sneezing, coughing, runny nose, raspy voice, pale skin, etc.). You could identify them accurately enough to be as safe with COVID as with any other virus.</p>

        <p>Trade-offs are a real thing. Lockdowns have sent <a href="https://summit.news/2020/08/10/global-lockdowns-set-to-plunge-100-million-into-extreme-poverty/">hundreds of millions of people</a> of all ages into poverty in an (largely unsuccessful) attempt to contain a virus that's killed 3 million and has an average age of death of over 80. It's going to take these people years to get back up to a sustainable living standard and many of them are going to die along the way. </p>
<p>If you isolate 30% of the population, there's still the 70% that's going to be out and about spreading the virus. They're then going to bring it to their homes, spread it to their families, and otherwise create vectors through which COVID can spread anyway. You're never going to reduce COVID deaths by more than 10-20% through lockdowns. So unless you want to shut down literally every aspect of society (including power plants, food production, water distribution, etc.) and have half the world's population starve to death, there's really not a whole lot you can do.</p>

        <p>Also it's not true that places that did the right thing had the exact same results as places that didn't.</p>
<p>It's not really fair to compare places that are totally different, so let's compare lockdown vs no lockdown, all else being equal.</p>
<p>look at deaths per million. Sweden has 1,376 deaths per 1 million population, while its neighbor Norway has 135 deaths per 1 million population. That's a difference of 10 times. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</p>
<p>I don't think it's practical to have lockdowns for a year, but a lot of good could've been done if people had complied for just 2-4 weeks in the beginning of the pandemic.</p>

        <p>It is absolutely true. You just choose to ignore it.</p>
<p>Sweden did better than all of western Europe, but you choose to cherry pick Norway because it fits your narrative. Stop doing that. There is no correlation between restrictions and good results. Zero. Go look at every state in the US. You are ignorant to the actual results of restrictions. </p>
<p>If people complied for 2-4 weeks in the beginning? What planet do you live on? The entire world locked down harder than has ever happened in human history. Every attempt to stop the spread has ended in failure, yet people like you keep insisting that we double down on things that have been proven not to work.</p>
