    <strong>Anxious about the future and vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>With the vaccine on the horizon, there are talks of a immunity passport to allow international travel. Letâ€™s face it this is going to become our reality. Fighting against this means spending the rest of your life in only one country. With my home country being the UK, the idea of this is grim. I despise this country, itâ€™s government and media. Its going to take so much effort to resist the vaccine and the new normal that at some point I think I will give up and comply. My anxiety about the future and the vaccine is so high. Iâ€™m paranoid that the vaccine is going to cause infertility or mute peopleâ€™s personalities or something else horrible. No one I know personally gives a shit about all this and when I talk about it they give me a weird look like Iâ€™m a conspiracy theorist. The only way Iâ€™m coping is to not listen to mainstream media and spend a lot of time by myself in nature. I can tell my lack of socialising isnâ€™t good for me but I donâ€™t know what else to do. I donâ€™t want to live in this society.</p></p>

        <p>I understand how you feel, I'm also in the same boat. I too am anxious about immunity passports and forced vaccinations and the covid vaccines being used to damage us in some way. I'm also alone with my opinions in all of my social circles and my family. My family, they're all brainwashed doomers. My friends? they're also brainwashed. (And the only friend I had who was as awake to this as I am, vanished on me last week, so I haven't had anyone to talk or vent to about this insanity and crap in a while, having to bottle it up or turn to this reddit.)</p>
<p>I also wish I could just <em>not</em> be in society and just live where this covid hysteria doesn't exist and people are actually sane and there's no ridiculous muzzling or restrictions impeding normal life, no more fear mongering, just freedom and peace.</p>

        <p>Same here. I wish I could go somewhere far away from this dystopian world. Somewhere with real freedom and fresh air. Somewhere where I will be loved and held and be able to have a family of my own. Where all this fear and heartache are nothing but distant memories ðŸ˜¢ðŸ’”</p>

        <p>Only about 40 to 50% people get the flu shot.   Expect  similar compliance with the covid shot.</p>
<p>You are going to see massive ad campaigns to convince you, to shame you into taking it.</p>
<p>I am unsure how the black community will break.  Will they take it because they trust biden or not take an unproven experimental drug.</p>
<p>Everyone should be anxious about......
.
A. The untested nature of the drug.
.
B.  The manner in that it will be forced on us.

        <p>I honestly feel for people in the UK. </p>
<p>you guys have no way out of that hell hole if shit really goes down. </p>
<p>Say what you will about the U.S but people have been quietly resisting and many states have exercised their power to say no. </p>
<p>I don't think things will go down here without a fight at least and many Americans are prepared to go to w.a.r for these things so we have a fighting chance. </p>
<p>A lot of our citizens want to flee but there's nowhere to flee with the same quality of life and same dedication to freedom. Anywhere else, unless you're already wealthy or have some remote work that permits you to earn U.S dollars abroad will be a downgrade for a lot of people. </p>
<p>But if you're in the UK it might be worth considering to leave. You're basically trapped there if airlines mandate vaccines. </p>
<p>However at least one airline will let people fly unvaccinated <em>if</em> and only <em>if</em> the UK authorizes planes to land without vaccinated customers. </p>
<p>if not you might have refugee situations with the unvaxxed fleeing from these countries. </p>
<p>wild to think about</p>

        <p>I'm worried about this, too. Heck, I'm worried that they're eventually going to require proof of vaccination to get into freaking stores and I'll be either lining up for the jab after all or standing in the snow waiting for curbside pickup of products I won't be able to see before buying them.</p>
