    <strong>Did any of my fellow New Jersey residents see the devastating news today from Gov. Murphy?</strong>

<p>I don’t even know what to say at this point.  Today, the so-called protector of this state, Phil Murphy, implied that a second round of draconian lockdowns is very likely, and he will do it very soon if cases don’t go down.  He will be shutting down all non-essential businesses, including restaurants, bars, movie theaters, churches, schools, and even parks and golf courses I’m pretty sure.  When I told all my friends that this would likely happen, they didn’t believe me and said, “He just says that to scare people.”  Well, now it’s imminent and I am sick to my stomach with dread and despair.  I’ve gone through enough of a rough year mental health wise, and I finally was starting to see the light.  But this complete psychopath running out state has decided to take a complete step back, with complete disregard to the fact that science says this is not at all necessary.</p>
<p>The fact that sucks the most is, we are completely powerless to stop it.  If Trump wins, the decision will still be up to the states, so we’ll be in for a second round of this nonsense for who knows how long.  If Biden wins, I expect to see an Italy-style lockdown as soon as he gets in, where we need to get passes to show the police just so we can go on a walk and get essential supplies. </p>
<p>The future is just completely hopeless at this point.  And no, I’m not planning to follow the order if it actually happens, even if I get arrested for doing so.  But even so, there’s only so much I can do if everything is closed and I’m working entirely from home.  I can go for walks around the block or go to people’s houses that are like minded and are allowing people to visit, and that’s literally it.  What do you guys all think of this nonsense, and how are you planning to cope with it if and when he goes through with it?  I expect it to go into effect within the next week or two, so I’m trying to mentally prepare myself for it.</p></p>

        <p>I can't believe this. We're not even allowed to get sick anymore or we'll be punished! They should lock up Murphy and the rest of the clown governors who took away our natural rights by proposing these ideas of lunacy!</p>

        <p>It’s cold season and flu season on top of this, and people will be spending more time indoors as a result.  COVID is a virus just like the flu or cold, so yes, IT SPREADS.  That’s exactly how it works.  And this moron thinks that by doing a full, draconian-style lockdown of this state and costing thousands of lives in suicides and drug overdoses and thousands of dollars of unemployment, he’s going to magically make it go away.  It’s completely useless and over-the-top, and he should 1,000% be sued by every business in the state if he tries to pull this ridicule again.  And the worst part: a few weeks ago, he said, “I don’t expect to lock down NJ again.  In fact, I’d be devastated if I had to go to that level.”  Well, here we are, and he doesn’t seem too concerned.</p>
<p>If Trump wins this election, I’m scared for the future of New Jersey.  If Biden wins, I’m scared for the future of this entire country.</p>

        <p>My dad thinks it’s just an election scare tactic, which could be true, but I can genuinely see it going into effect next week or the week after, regardless of who wins the election.  I haven’t trusted Murphy at any point since his initial reopening date of April 7th passed by without a peep, so I only assume the worst in him.  Also, if masks and social distancing work so well, why don’t we just do that instead of locking down?  It’s complete idiocy at this point, and the people need to stand up.</p>
