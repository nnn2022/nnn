        <p>CC: documented MSM evidence that Hancock ordered excess DnR resulting in vastly excessive "covid death counts" and of course the literal murder of the disabled, mentally handicapped and the elderly.</p>

        <p>Not defending Hancock but this practice has actually been going on for years. Used to work extensively in specialist psychiatric wards for people with learning disabilities and the level of poor care and neglect on show was truly shocking. If you want to go down that rabbit hole, I’d suggest searching Connor Sparrowhawk, Winterbourne View and Whorlton Hall for three major scandals from the last ten years. </p>
<p>It’s actually a foundation for what I believe now - I saw evidence of the patients being effectively imprisoned, told that the things they enjoyed were too dangerous and given unnecessary PRN medication just to knock them out and keep them quiet. I didn’t agree with it happening to them and I’m not happy when someone tries it on me. It also made me very cynical of the hero-worship of healthcare staff and the NHS. I honestly think doomers would refer to Dr. Shipman or Dr. Mengele as “healthcare heroes” if they had the same platform as Dr. Fauci today.</p>

        <p>The framing of these random websites is not great. It really takes away a lot of the credibility of these claims.</p>
<p>I say that as someone who thinks Hancock is a fucking cnut!</p>

        <p>He's trying to save the NHS, not save sick patients.  See the difference?  It's your responsibility, as a citizen, to save the national health service, not the other way around, with them saving you if you're sick.  He really is just as stupid as he looks.</p>

        <p>Didn't David Icke say in his second interview with Brian Rose of London Real say that they were having hospitals impose a DnR orders for people going to hospital for orthopedic procedures? Didn't Mr. Icke also say that they were doing this to "protect the elderly?" The very people the NHS and U.K. government are supposed to be protecting.</p>
