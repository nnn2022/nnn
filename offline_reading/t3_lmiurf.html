    <strong>A Little Bit of Optimism</strong>
    <p><p>With all the negative news and bullshit we see in the media I just want to share a bit of an optomistic outlook. </p>
<p>I wanna start with saying that Covid has been relatively easy for me. I did not lose my job. I was not forced to work at home. I did not lose contact with many friends. However, I was unable to expierence my college graduation, say goodbye to my friends for the last time, or see some family for many months. I also coped with the situation by getting addicted , uh , to say the least, a few different substances. </p>
<p>Anyway, the connotation behind COVID being the scariest thing in the world to the masses is dying. The media is losing its power of the people and life is, although very slowly, returning to normal. For example, I no longer see ANYONE at my apartment complex wearing masks. Bars are still restricted, but the owners no longer follow restrictions as harshly. Last week I was able to hang out in a bar with a group of friends without being restricted to a table. I also saw live music at an indoor venue for the first time in almost a year, and I live in a very blue state. As someone whom music has carried me through this absolute shithole of a year, that was the turning point in my mental health. As a extrovert, I have finally been able to branch out in my new city and meet new friends and FUCK does it feel amazing. </p>
<p>As many of you have seen and posted about recently, the r/coronavirus subreddit is slowly waking up from their foggy minds clouded by the media. I encourage you to not ostracize them for not doing so sooner, and instead explain with a kind heart how we have all been fighting the same battle for a year. Some of us just realized sooner than others. I will admit I was terrified for the first month. </p>
<p>It is getting better and will continue to get better. Stay strong my friends and continue to not accept the denial of your freedoms. God speed.</p></p>

        <p>r/coronavirus slowly waking up has seriously been one of the greatest reliefs I've seen this year so far. A lot of people, myself included, thought the vaccines would be the end of this, and once everyone who wants one gets one we will be over this. But then articles are coming out saying "vaccines aren't a silver bullet" and that's what I think changed a LOT of people's perception, seeing that we're just being played like a fiddle and how there's no exit strategy that governments are pleased with.                <br>
I definitely see resistance growing which is the only way these draconian measures around the globe will end, so we need to keep speaking to keep that momentum going.</p>

        <p>For real, I always read r/coronavirus (Specifically the discussion threads) and it helps me sleep better at night nowadays, when you realize that they're finally waking up to all of the lies, unlike last year in 2020 where it was all doom and gloom. I love that sub now</p>
