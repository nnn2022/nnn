    <strong>Next time someone mentions the "pandemic", ask them why they think there is a pandemic.</strong>
    <p><p>Is it because people all around them are dying from COVID?</p>
<p>Is it because they know a lot of people they know ended up in ICU?</p>
<p>... or is it because the government and media says so?</p>
<p>Do it. It might get them to think and they may even change their mind.</p>
<p>Seriously.. remove the masks and you would hardly notice or remember there is a pandemic.</p></p>

        <p>I totally share your sentiment here, but talking nonsense probably isn't the best way to get your point across. The definition of a pandemic is "event in which a disease spreads across several countries and affects a large number of people", which covid absolutely does and you can hardly argue against it. The question you should be really asking is how this particular pandemic is any different than flu pandemic which we happen to be living with for as long as we can remember.</p>

        <p>I really don't know about that. This is pretty much the definition I remember from school. And that was in 80's. I actually think it's the other way around. I think that it isn't the definition that changed, but rather people's mental image of the thing. You see, when I was still young and sexy, everyone knew that there's a number of epidemics going on. But nobody was going bananas over that stuff, because everyone knew that contracting something doesn't necessarily mean you'll drop dead or you'll kill your grandma</p>
