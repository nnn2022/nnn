        <p>It’s genuinely amazing. “No the vaccine isn’t mandatory you (insert vulgarity here)!” You science denier! If you got vaccinated we’d be back to normal!” </p>
<p>You mean the normal that fully vaccinated people have? The normal of them being terrified to take off a mask they’re favorite doctors told them they don’t need anymore? It’s honestly batshit crazy how these people act like they have sympathy for others and then rant and rave about how they don’t care if people die to a virus. The same people who say “500k people died due to you, grandmas died due to you.” Would not give a rats ass if those 500k people died due to not getting vaccinated by choice.</p>

        <p>One group of unvaccinated people they do have sympathy for is people who can’t get vaccinated because of medical issues. A lot of Doomers claim that they’re not removing their masks in order to protect these people.</p>
<p>However, I’m not remotely convinced that group of people actually exists. The CDC seems to be recommending everybody get a COVID vaccine, medical issues be damned. Who exactly are these people who can’t get a COVID vaccine for medical reasons?</p>

        <p>It's called PPE for a reason. Anyone claiming that a PPE device is for 'protecting other people' is literally insane.<br>
When was the last time you wore a safety vest or floaties on your arms to protect other people?</p>

        <p>I think the doomers have actually moved that goalpost bc 1) they're saying almost everyone can get it BUT 2) they provided the great excuse that the vaccine doesn't seem to be "taking" on the immunocompromised. So they want everyone to get it but you must get it bc the vaccines the immunocompromised get don't work.  It's really convenient they came up with that one.</p>

        <p>Perhaps people who have a known allergy to one of the ingredients and risk an anaphylactic shock.</p>
<p>Although, with the ever-growing menu of vaccines to choose from, this might become less relevant as you could avoid one ingredient by opting for a different vaccine.</p>
<p>I know PEG is used in the mRNA vaccines but I don't know if it's used in the others.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it seems there's already been cases of anaphylaxis, presumably in people who didn't know they were allergic.</p>

        <p>I’m “one of those people” it won’t be mandatory. I’m also one of the people that medically can’t get it, but if your not getting it for the wrong reasons, like “the government is trying to microchip us”, or “The vaccine has a 30% mortality rate and it’s all a giant cover-up”, then yes I would be a bit mad at you. It’s people like you spreading misinformation and preventing more people from being vaccinated, not only keeping themselves unprotected without a good reason, but keeping <em>me</em> unprotected, and all the other people that can’t be vaccinated.</p>
