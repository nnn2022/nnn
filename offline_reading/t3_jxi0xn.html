        <p>I had 2 grandfathers, both in their 80s, who caught a cold and died from pneumonia a couple years ago.</p>
<p>No one cared. No one wore masks. No one closed schools.</p>
<p>What are we doing? Old folks die of respirator infections, that's life.</p>

        <p>Vaccination certificates/immunity passports are definitely on the way. You will have to scan an app on your phone to get into common businesses. Ticketmaster toyed with the idea then backpedaled hard when there was outrage, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>As for the veganism, in the WEF video about the year 2030, they said meat will only be an occasional treat, not part of our regular diet. Whether or not it comes true, it is a goal of theirs.</p>

<p>And of course meat will only be an occasional treat. For the elites. Just as those "green spaces" freed up by corralling folks in cities will be playgrounds for the elites. None of this has anything to do with "protecting the environmemt" or whatever other "greater good" bullshit they try to feed us. They know nothing of ecology. They can't even grasp how their own power-grabbing behavior - ultimately just as destructive to them as it is to us - is itself a product of ecology.</p>

        <p>Well, it was never about the virus or "saving lives". You really think they are so obsessed with saving lives? If you believe such a thing, I have a bridge to sell you. </p>
<p>Ask yourself,  if the governments were truly looking out for our health and lives, would we have GMOs aka franken foods, rampant obesity, polution, fast food, nuclear power and waste,  cigarettes or carcinogenic chemicals all around us? Why don't they ban those substances that are sure to kill us, unlike this bad flu they call Covid? </p>

        <p>Because you can’t ‘catch’ obesity and lung cancer from someone coughing near you. If I give myself diabetes I can’t go outside and spread it to other people. Apples and oranges, dude. </p>
<p>Let me ask you, why the fuck would a capitalist government order their people to lockdown if it wasn’t something serious? </p>
<p>A couple more things; nuclear power isn’t the boogeyman under your bed, pollution is going to kill us but half of our government doesn’t see it as a big deal which is why nothings being done about it, and not all GMOs are evil. You’ve got a point with obesity, but unless clinically diagnosed, it’s a choice, and again, can’t catch it.</p>

        <p>All our actions reverberate, man. For instance, you can't catch a case of the lockdowns, but guess what? Lockdowns are killing 10,000 children every month, and is projected to increase TB deaths by an extra 1.5 MILLION. So that's a choice you're making every day that has literally killed people. Maybe you should really soak that in. The UN report about the children was a few months ago, so because of YOUR choices, 30,000-50,000 kids are rotting in the ground. I mean that literally. How dare you, you terrible person! Ooooh god let me clutch my fucking pearls a little harder. You goddamn kid killer™!!!!</p>

        <p>Nah fuck those 3rd world children. No big loss, they can just make more. These brainwashed snowflakes screaming for lockdowns are only concerned about lives in their own backyards and only the lives that used the preferred pronouns while they were still alive. Also, no Trump supporter lives matter either because they're all are obviously racist! If you hurt my feelings your life doesn't matter and I hope you get Covid. And if you don't support the same causes as me and virtue signal for them, you can also fuck off and die. /s</p>

        <p>The flaming hypocrisy of progressives caring sooo hard for developing countries and then throwing these kids under the bus because they're far away is so gross. Along with the TB, HIV, and malaria deaths that will mostly be suffered by poor black and brown folk. As a liberal (type person whatever I hate labels), feels like I've lost my team.</p>

        <p>First of all, I’m not claiming to be some all understanding being of everything going on. We are still in the beginning phase. I expect the soonest change will be all digital currency. That benefits them because they have total control and understanding of everyone’s money, where and how it’s being spent. Listen to what he said, and then go listen to other leaders say the same thing. It’s not just Trudeau, I just chose that clip because he sounds like a creep and it’s short. make your own distinctions.</p>

        <p>I think what he’s talking about is needed. I don’t think it will be anywhere near as extreme as the ‘great reset’ theories out there. Honestly, I think it will be underwhelming and have very little affect on the issues our society is facing; too little too late. Those are my opinions based on the facts that I have; this video, nor any others like it prove any of the ‘great reset’ theories out there. </p>
<p>Just a note, the government already knows what you spend your money on. Sure, it doesn’t know if you take a twenty out and back a pack of smokes, or if you don’t keep a bank account and hide your cash in your sofa. But switching to online currency won’t make it any easier to track your finances. Not to mention, we’re already a pretty cashless society.</p>

        <p>I agree. And I really do hope it’s not as drastic as I believe it could be. As for cashless, you are correct that we are progressively becoming more and more digital, but removing the option to have untraceable minor transactions is quite scary to me.</p>

        <p>In the long run, it isn't. Just another power-grabbing behavior under the guise of some "greater good" bullshit - an artifact of the social cycle; behavioral sink, human-style - that is ultimately just as destructive to corporations and governments as it is to average citizens. This isn't some big conspiracy, just simple population dynamics and evolutionary psychology.</p>

        <p>As do I.  And during the peak of this, my hospital and all of the others in neighboring counties were all empty.  Some hospitals closed entire floors.  My hospital had an average number of 4 patients during the peak.  We had to cancel allll elective procedures and lie in wiat for covid patients- patients that never ever came.  We had an average of 4 patients in the entire building on any given day in April!   And people who needed to be treated for other things were told no unless they were dying.   What kind of bullshit governor forces hospitals to not treat human beings who need help?!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Instead we laid off staff, closed departments, and just hoped we could financially survive.  and it looks like we may be headed that way again!</p>

        <p>Cool. Where do you live? I'm in Seattle, so I bet my March looked very different from your March. My hospital is back at nearly the same levels as April now, and it's only November. Our COVID floor is filled with overflow going into the CCU. Last time we had to turn our special procedure unit into the CCU, so I'm betting we'll have to do that again soon.</p>

        <p>It's flu season now.  And no test can diagnose covid.   The Portugal court recently ruled the covid test to be a farce.  It's not reliable unless labs are running it no higher than 30 MAX cycles instead of the 40+ that everyone is running.  So tests are bunk.  So what else is your hospital doing to tell covid from the flu?  They have the exact same symptoms.</p>
<p>And there hasn't been any evidence of covid hitting every single year because this is the first year- but even then- it's parent virus only hit once.  ONE AND DONE VIRUS and even a medical assistant knows what one and done means.</p>
<p>So you're taking scared people with the flu and scaring them into thinking they have a virus that only hit once and scaring them so badly that they are convinced they're going to die.</p>
<p>Yeah, sounds like quality medical care to me.  When you can show me a test method used by your hospital that diagnoses covid-19 with 1 95% accuracy (insted of the bullshit 10% used as reported by the New York Times) then I'll be glad to discuss things with you.</p>

        <p>So it’s both just the same people who would’ve died of flu, and inaccurate count? </p>
<p>Yet the US hasn’t seen covid during full height of flu season yet.</p>
<p>As an aside, the simple measures, ACTUALLY being asked (mask, social distancing) are not being taken seriously. If populations took that advice seriously, we would not be in lockdowns (for at least as long, severe).</p>

        <p>We had safer at home/ safer at home orders for months.  There are no hard curfews, and we do need to assign a correct definition to "lockdown" as it was inappropriately used.  There are serious negative consequences due to the safe/safer at home order, but this all could have been eased from the start.  If we as a country took this more seriously back in March and April of 2020 we would not be in this situation.  The Federal government's failure to act on this has stretched this situation out and it is going to have dire financial consequences for millions of Americans.</p>

        <p>Many places around the world - including the US - did indeed have strict stay-at-home orders with curfews and police checkpoints. Perhaps you didn't notice because you rarely leave home anyway? The government has done more than enough for this incredibly mild pandemic, a pandemic so deadly that all who died this year are outnumbered every few days by new babies being born. The situation is being stretched out by loud-mouthed cowards like you eating up media hype and demanding governments/corporations dO sOmEtHiNg.

        <p>Yes all things that need to be addressed by the Federal government. You know what helps with suicide, depression, and drug addiction? Access to Mental Health Services. You know what could greatly help the lack of motivation in school? Increased Education funding to help reverse the Covid Slide. Hunger and poverty? How about Universal Basic Income for the duration of the pandemic?  These are solutions that other countries have used during the pandemic.</p>

        <p>Mental health services - like almost all health services - prioritize keeping people alive over improving quality of life.</p>
<p>The lack of motivation in school has less to do with lack of funding and more to do with expecting millions of youth to follow more-or-less the same curriculum.</p>
<p>Hunger and poverty are exacerbated by expending resources on keeping the elderly/infirm alive and "well" at the expense of the younger generations.</p>
<p>The "other countries" you speak of are mostly all authoritarian collectivist hellholes destined to fall as would an incestuous bloodline or field of monocropped grain.</p>

        <p>I cant wait to see the death numbers for things like flu and pnumonia at the end of the year.  I suspect those will be signicabtly lower this year compared to previous years because those people would have died regardless.  Hundreds of thousands die from that every year too, we just dont track it daily to freak people out.</p>

        <p>Yes, but it's also to be expected. In a nation of 300 million, a world of 7 billion, we can't all be expected to unite under the same flag as one big happy family. That's why, while I'm a libertarian on the political compass, I'm a decentralist above all else: the fracturing we see today along political and philosophical lines is inevitable, so we might as well agree to disagree as peacefully as humanly possible. Unfortunately collectivism, interventionism, globalism, etc is antithetical to agreeing to disagree peacefully. And our opposition tends to be rather collectivist.</p>

        <p>This argument is very weak and entirely misleading. Here's an easy example to prove it.</p>
<p>Lets say the average life expectancy is 80. And let's say half of folks die at age 70 and half of folks die at age 90. Shitty, simplistic numbers but bear with me.</p>
<p>Now let's apply your argument.</p>
<p>If all of the folks who previously lived until they were 90 started dieing at 80, guess what happens to the average life expectancy? It goes down.</p>
<p>Might want to pick another argument FYI.</p>

        <p>I understand that's how one's mind might normally process that information (mine did too, frankly, because it seems to be intuitive), but simply because the average age of death aligns with the average life expectancy doesn't mean that the latter would not change as a result.</p>
<p>To put it another way, some of the folks who have died from covid were going to live past the average life expectancy, but that fact is already built into the average life expectancy figure to begin with. It essentially <em>assumes</em> these folks were going to live longer than the average, and when coupled with the folks who would normally die before the average, that's how you would arrive at the average life expectancy to begin with. With covid, you're cutting short the lives of the normally above average group, and that inherently reduces the average itself.</p>
<p>Wish I could explain it better but I'm not the best at these sorts of things haha.</p>

        <p>By this logic covid is EXTENDING the lives of the 90 year olds who are dying because of it.  Old people die.  The people who are dying of covid would have been incredibly subsceptible to practically any virus.  Thats what this proves.  If the average age of people dying from covid was 65, it would mean something different.</p>

        <p>Now you're just moving the goalposts for the sake of winning an argument. Yes, let's kill off the entire planet save for one very old person and we can say we were able to get the average life expectancy to 105. Extremely example, but the argument is just so...pointless and ridiculous. You act as if we're helping people by killing others off.</p>
<p>IMO, it's less about the severity and more about how preventable this loss of life was. If the requirement to save these folks was for each person in the world to cut off their own arm, we'd of course would be balking about such a response unless the human race itself was at risk. But it was just masks, just social distancing, and just minimal to moderate inconvenience from the very beginning. That's all. Shutdowns and the like only became necessary because we didn't react responsibly like, say, South Korea or Japan, and governments decided to act on their own. Whether you agree with the approach or not, there's no question that they have reacted the way they have due to our own failure to act responsibly. We have no one to blame but ourselves for allowing that can of worms to be opened and, frankly, for the response to be as ineffective as it has been in some cases as some folks continue to act defiantly.</p>
<p>You're also ignoring the number of folks whose lives have been impaired long-term as a result of the virus, as well as the asymptomatic/less symptom crowd which has suffered internal damage as well. There's no telling exactly how that's going to play out years or even decades from now. The problem is folks like yourself act as if we have all the answers to covid-19 at the present moment, but we do not. We know what it will do in the immediate and short-term, but the long-term impacts of the virus are unknown to us right now. Do you really want to look back and say "Oops. Guess we really didn't know everything about the virus. Now we're fucked." Sorry, but just because you want to take that chance on behalf of everyone else doesn't mean the rest of us should be willing to put up with that.</p>

        <p>There is no "exact number", because you baseline off an average of the previous years. You calculate an estimate with a margin of error. It's called statistics. </p>
<p>So far, it's looking like about 275k.

        <p>Covid is contagious, not "deadly".  If you count someone who has died in a car crash but also tested positive as a "covid death" because there is financial incentive to do so, no shit the numbers will be high.  If you look at the people who are actually dying from covid, you will see its the same demographic who dies from many diseases to begin with.</p>

<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:  </p>

<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>

<p>Page 38: (this test cannot accurately test for Covid-19)</p>
<p>Detection  of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that  2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.• The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.• The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.• This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</p>
<p>Page 39.  (the virus has yet to even be isolated in a lab yet we are testing for it?)</p>
<p>Since  no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available,  assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with  characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene;  GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/µL) spiked  into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral  transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How about a court ruling?  Portugal ruled that the tests are not only unreliable, but the positives are only 3% accurate.  That's 3%.  That means that 97% of them are false positives.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Hell, even the New York Times posted that the PCR tests are being misused so badly that it's complete garbage.  They cited the test at being only 10% accurate.</p>

<p>I'm not going to lose any sleep over your continued fear.  I know that as long as you stayed glued to the TV and the media, you will forever tremble in fear over this virus that is just GONE by now.  So I'm not going to try to change your mind.  Enjoy the sources I know you won't look at.</p>

        <p>250,000 people did not die of covid- it was a huge over-count.  It's been stated multiple times that anyone who dies and tests positive for covid (using 2 tests that have been proven to be highly inaccurate) they are counted as covid death even if covid didn't kill them.  </p>
<p>If I suffer massive kidney failure at the exact time a brain aneurysm ruptures and the stress of the two cause me to suffer a heart attack and I crash my car which explodes in a fiery inferno, I'd still be counted as a covid death if I tested positive a week ago.</p>

        <p>This is not the truth. They do not count your death as being CoVid-19 related unless you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Test positive.</li>
<li>They come to the conclusion that the CoVid-19 was directly to blame for your death.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: The 'guy who fell off a ladder'. After doing an autopsy, they found out that the CoVid-19 had trashed his blipping lungs and that is the reason why he passed out and fell off the ladder.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was a CoVid-19 direct death because if he had NOT had CoVid-19, his lungs would have been fine.</p>

        <p>I will certainly be curious after the year is over how many of the covid deaths are ACTUALLY "excess" when we see deaths of similar types significantly lower.  Of course noone is tracking "flu deaths" with a ticking counter so how do we even know what "excess" means?  Literally millions of people die every year, we just dont pay attention this close.</p>

<p>No: My father if he had not gotten this virus could have lived to 80... most likely would have lived to 80. Mom? 90+!</p>

        <p>I highly doubt your mother was "healthy as a horse" at 69. Yes, there are some remarkably healthy middle-aged and elderly individuals, but more often than not, they and their loved ones sre in denial of how unhealthy they are. My mother-in-law is morbidly obese with pernicious anemia and a chronic abdomincal wall abscess, but she, her friends, many family members, and even her doctors say she's "healthy" too. That doesn't mean it's true. The only reason 70 is not "exceptionally old" today is because of aggressive medical treatment and "public health" policy that often sacrifices quality of life, treatments and policies that will fall short sooner rather than later. We shouldn't be so taken aback when older people - even as "young" as 69 - begin dying in droves.</p>
