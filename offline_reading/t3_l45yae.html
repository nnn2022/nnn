    <strong>Thank God For This Subreddit</strong>
    <p><p>It is truly an oasis of humanity and sanity in this fucking dystopian desert devoid of morality and independent thought. I just want to give a heartfelt thanks to each and every one of you for keeping me mentally afloat during this whole retarded cluster-fuck; even the lurking doomers in the comments wishing death upon me and my loved ones for simply arguing against the fascistic bullshit that is the "new normal". Your ignorance and hypocrisy has reassured me that I, and everyone else posting here, am on the right side of history. You will look back on your single-minded obedience with fucking shame in the years to come.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask does not make you a good person. Showing compassion, humility and warmth towards your fellow human beings makes you a good person. I see none of that from any of you smug, patronising, "morally superior" fuck-heads. You are devoid of empathy. The mask is merely that: a mask to hide the emotional emptiness and supreme selfishness inside, a virtue-signal and symbol that you care about others.</p>
<p>Well, you don't. I have had it with you utter arseholes demanding we acquiesce to the insanity. That we wear something that's been proven beyond a doubt NOT to work. That we offer up ourselves as guinea pigs for a fucking vaccine so untested we don't even know the long term effects or if it stops you transmitting the virus. That right there should be your first fucking clue that something is amiss, that maybe this needs a bit more testing first. But no, pfft, fuck logic and reason, right? Who gives a fuck about that? Just plunge that shit directly into my arm!</p>
<p>You fucking retards. This shit is never going to end, the goal posts are just gonna keep moving. Masks and lockdowns clearly don't fucking work or this shit would be over by now! You're being fucking lied to and you don't fucking care! The numbers are more inflated than your fucking Fauci fuck-doll! Whatever, just go back to fucking baking obscene amounts of bread like in first lockdown and guffawing at shitty, unfunny memes of Bernie Sanders superimposed over various images of pop culture. There's no getting through to you so fuck it.</p>
<p>The vast majority of this subreddit just wants this demented circus to fucking end, but the fucking fat lady can't sing because there's a fucking fabric gag over her mouth and she's prohibited from singing, anyway. You fear-mongering, fascist fucks are trying to normalize face-masks, lockdowns and mandated vaccines to justify your fucking extreme moral cowardice and cuckoldery in following the narrative. You are enabling the government to take away our basic human rights in the name of a jumped-up common cold and using grandma as justification for your total lack of autonomy. Take your masks and kindly go fuck yourselves.</p></p>
