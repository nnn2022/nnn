        <p>Ireland's population...nearly 5 million. But ten deaths is apparently apocalyptic. You see this literally everywhere. This is why I like to call Covid 1984. The world has lost all touch with any sense of sanity. Mass psychosis.</p>

        <p>Ugh I live with a doomer (here in Ireland) and she tells me how terrible it was how someone wasn't wearing a mask today and that there are going to be pandemics all the time because of climate change and whatnot and how sorry she feels for my generation because there will be pandemics and lockdowns galore for the rest of our lives. It's so annoying.</p>
<p>Disease and death EXISTED before this damn thing. They will CONTINUE to exist. My grandmother had to worry about polio growing up but did she lock herself in her room and stop living her life because of that? NO. We put our lives at risk every day, and we can't hide from this virus. I'm getting fed up with how people here in Ireland are acting over this thing. It's like you're not allowed to think outside the box and have a different opinion.</p>

        <p>This is the most terrifying thing of all...the fact that now the populace has been programmed to accept that 1. a low IFR virus is much more deadly than it actually because "experts" and media said so...and 2. this as a completely sane, scientific, rational response to a virus. So what's stopping those in power from just finding a virus every couple of years and doing this bullshit perpetually? A worldwide dystopia built on lying about viruses and "saving lives"?</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’ll last. The Irish are being more rebellious this time. Everyone dutifully followed the lockdown back in the spring; I lived in the heart of Dublin then and saw very few people out. Now that’s not happening. There are restrictions but tons of people are breaking them and nothing’s really being enforced aside from certain places being closed. And today there was actually a protest in downtown Dublin against lockdowns. So these are all good signs. The Irish may not admit it but they’re more rebellious than one would think.</p>
<p>Someone told me that this is kinda like 9/11; everyone was freaking out but then people started to calm down and move on from it after a time. I mean yeah there’s airport security, but that’s no big deal and most people don’t fly every day. Lockdowns won’t last because it affects our everyday lives, and we’re just not going to put up with it anymore.</p>
