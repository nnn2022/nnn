    <strong>Important Read: 2017 SPARS Report and likely long-term responses to Covid</strong>
    <p><p><em>(A long read but its worth it)</em></p>
<p>This may have appeared here before but I never saw it or heard about it until it was brought up on the latest episode of the <strong>Propaganda Report</strong> podcast (a good listen, though I don’t agree with everything they put forward, they cover interesting topics).</p>
<p>They mentioned a scenario produced by <a href="https://jhsphcenterforhealthsecurity.s3.amazonaws.com/spars-pandemic-scenario.pdf">Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security</a> in 2017 that considered what would happen in a major viral pandemic.</p>
<p>These are the same people who organised Event 201 with the <em>Gates Foundation</em> (who believe population reduction is vital) and the <em>World Economic Forum</em> (who see the pandemic as a means for pushing through major non-health related social and institutional changes).</p>
<p>Event 201 was considered suspicious in view of its timing, discussing a new corona pandemic just one or two months before it began. Two years earlier the Johns Hopkins team was already setting the ground work with a scenario that saw <em>“the emergence of a novel coronavirus in Southeast Asia”</em> which they name <em>SPARS-CoV</em>. Following the outbreak a vaccine is developed for it which they term <em>CoroVax</em>.</p>
<p>The paper discusses the efforts to get the population to accept the vaccine rollout but there were a few points within it raised by the Propaganda Report team that I want to highlight for you. Note: Their pandemic scenario begins in 2025 and runs for three years to 2028.</p>
<p>It begins with using a common (fictional) drug called Kalocivir to treat the outbreak but:</p>
<p>&rt;(p. 15) "<em>After Kalocivir was in public use for three months, the FDA was able to release updated information about the drug’s effectiveness and the incidence of side effects. This information came too late, however, for large portions of the general public. In Wisconsin, where many individuals were treated with Kalocivir, local citizens posted, Tweeted, chatted, and Zapped real-time impressions of the drug. While some claimed the drug was effective and even life-saving, most reported no effect and claimed that the drug had caused additional side effects, such as headaches, nausea, and body aches."</em></p>
<p>Reminiscent of efforts to downplay the safety and effectiveness of first Hydorchloroquine and now Ivermectin?</p>
<p>They then replace this with a vaccine called Corovax which was developed by Pharma (working with the NIH and FDA) based on another vaccine for animals that,</p>
<p>&rt;(p. 12) "<em>was effective at preventing SPARS-like illnesses in cows, pigs, and other hooved mammals, but</em> <strong><em>internal trials revealed several worrisome side effects, including swollen legs, severe joint pain, and encephalitis leading to seizures or death</em></strong>*. Because any animals experiencing these side effects were immediately killed, and because animals were typically slaughtered within a year of vaccination, further information regarding the short- and long-term effects of the GMI vaccine was unavailable."*</p>
<p>They make use of hiphop stars to promote this new "safe for humans" version of the vaccine to the black community, specifically referencing hesitancy due to Tuskagee (p. 26).</p>
<p>The government then indemnifies the makers against potential lawsuits due to side-effects, which is fortunate for them as,</p>
<p>&rt;(p. 60) "<em>While the federal government appeared to have appropriately addressed concerns around the acute side effects of Corovax, the long-term, chronic effects of the vaccine were still largely unknown.</em> <strong><em>Nearing the end of 2027, reports of new neurological symptoms began to emerge. After showing no adverse side effects for nearly a year, several vaccine recipients slowly began to experience symptoms such as blurry vision, headaches, and numbness in their extremities.</em></strong> <em>Due to the small number of these cases, the significance of their association with Corovax was never determined. As of this writing in 2030, longitudinal studies initiated by the NIH at the beginning of the vaccination program have not reached the next round of data collection, so formal analysis on these symptoms has not yet been conducted."</em></p>
<p>So, a year after vaccinations begin, signs of possible neurological side-effects appear but even three more years after that the initial NIH studies are still incomplete so no analysis of the side-effects has taken place. In other words, there is unlikely to be any formal investigation of side-effects until well after any damage has occurred.</p>
<p>They then begin to look at how to handle the adverse fallout from the vaccine. One doctor points out that,</p>
<p>&rt;(p. 62) <em>“Communities around the country went through what some felt was a harrowing public health emergency, only later to confront the possibility, however slim, that the medicine we promised would help them may in fact be hurting them.” The senior leaders in attendance concluded, after much prompting by Dr. Flynn, that no top political or public health figurehead had publicly recognized the collective sense of vulnerability that the pandemic had elicited or the strength that the public exhibited under threat of grave danger. Moreover,</em> <strong><em>no national leader had publicly acknowledged the public’s broad willingness to accept prescribed countermeasure that promised to end the pandemic, but whose long-term consequences were not fully understood at the time</em></strong>*."*</p>
<p>Finally, the Presidents position on the issue is discussed,</p>
<p>&rt;(p. 64) "*Following the meeting, ASPR recommended to HHS Secretary Nagel that SAMHSA collaborate with stakeholders and devise behavioral health guidance for the states, tribes, and territories on how to strengthen the public’s coping skills, provide support for grieving individuals, encourage a forward direction, and meet other SPARS recovery needs. It was further recommended that Secretary Nagel consult with President Archer about the possibility of acknowledging the emotional toll of SPARS during a future public appearance……*<strong><em>Top risk communication advisors from the CDC, FDA, NIH, and SAMHSA conferred as a group about how best to frame the President’s remarks. The group vigorously debated whether it was appropriate for the President to acknowledge the sacrifice that vaccine recipients had made on behalf of their communities or to console them in their grief over that sacrifice."</em></strong></p>
<p>Note that this is not a group warning us of the dangers of a mass vaccination campaign. It is a group that very strongly <em>supports</em> it and much of this document is merely considering how they will handle the negative fallout. They (Hopkins, NIH, FDA, CDC, WEF, etc.) were aware years ago that the population would easily be pushed into accepting a vaccine without realising it might have long-term negative effects. They also knew that any study of those effects would not occur until well after the damage was done. They then planned for a scenario in which the President of the USA might have to make speeches to the public consoling them for the grief and sacrifices they suffered <strong>due to the vaccine</strong>.</p>
<p>I advise you to download and keep a copy of the Johns Hopkins report as it may become inexplicably unavailable in the near future.</p></p>
