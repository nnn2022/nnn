        <p>I was there, what a great day! We walked so much I’m still in bed recovering right now lol I wish we had a turn out like the European marches. It makes me so scared to see how little people here in New York City care or realize what’s going on. It was so good to see such a diverse group of people too! The next one is in September and I will be there as well!</p>

        <p>I agree. NYC is home of the sheep and it's very frightening.  I was so disappointed by the turnout but there were definitely more people than the last two protests, which gives me hope that we can continue to wake more of them up!  I think that September is too far off for the next one to take place but I will still be there!</p>

        <p>You know what's funny though? I came to find out that there is another group doing a protest at the same time and this group thinks they're trying to undermine them. Sort of like controlled opposition. They are well aware that this main group exists and they're doing protest at the same time on purpose they had one in Madison Square Park with a few hundred people. Now if we put those two groups together it would have been more impressive. No idea why they are doing this but I got the name of that group to keep an eye on them.</p>

        <p>Is it just me or do the US protests seem so tiny compared to literally everywhere else in the world? That makes me nervous.</p>

        <p>Americans are pacified in general, but the vast majority of them don't believe any of the measures being put in place overseas would ever happen in America simply because we're America.</p>

        <p>Don't trust the MSM, its basically part of the military industrial complex that only answers to a very tiny plutocracy. For their part they've been overtly proficient in promoting the agenda, which includes sanitizing the airways of any form of rebellion or protest. In my own country the government funded state broad caster completely ignored a massive march. They're doing this on purpose, especially because my country's leaders all go to Davos(World Economic Forum). Hell the government is even in taking direct consultations from one of the WEF's directors Mark Carney who's the former Canadian and UK central banker. It doesn't get more blatant than that.</p>
