    <strong>Living our normal lives = acting recklessly (post from my facebook feed)</strong>
    <p><p><em>Nothing new here, but I was thinking if the gov't starts a snitch program these types will be on it like white on rice</em>:</p>
<p>"Someone I love dearly has been hospitalized with COVID. They are a private person and not on Facebook, but I'm thinking of them when I see all of the spring break vacation photos where folx are in groups with people they are not podding with. Indicating "we were tested before vacation!" is absurd. One can test negative and then later the same day test positive when the viral load becomes high enough to detect. The same day. And saying "we took everyone's temperature!" is absurd. Some individuals will carry the virus and be asymptomatic, but may infect others who may become incredibly ill or die. Saying "it's just family!" when there are multiple households in the photo is absurd. Infectious diseases do not care who is kin. Just because it's spring break does not mean the virus is over. When we act recklessly, we are putting others at risk."</p></p>

        <p>Well, my doomer detector and virtue signaling meters just went off at a high point.  Even HIV+ people are not really "asymptomatic".  I have a friend who is, and she does get some effects from having that in her system.  She carries on though!  This is similar to when someone posts they know a person who got COVID, then all of the sudden "here a friend, there a friend, everywhere a friend" had COVID too! And of course their entire families.  I only know five people who actually had it, and all of them recovered.  Two are in their 70's.  They actually just were out for a couple weeks, but they did recover and both fully active.  Two I know had some lingering symptoms after being in the hospital with it... but the diagnosis revealed other health issues. Neither one were "perfectly healthy" before they caught it either.</p>

<p>This poster is a virtue signaler.  Going out and living life is not acting recklessly.  The brawls and breaking property was, NOT potentially being "sick".  Still don't get the "asymptomatic" narrative.</p>

        <p>If that's the case, then I am one of the most reckless individuals on the planet. I've been going to work, going to my martial arts classes, no mask, visiting family, going outside, hiking, exercising, eating and drinking healthy, etc.</p>
