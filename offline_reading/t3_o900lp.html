    <strong>How long does heart inflammation occur after Covid-19 vaccination?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been looking around, and no one will tell when their test subjects have been vaccinated, and when the symptoms and diagnosis of Myocarditis started to come up. Even the Epoch Times won't say when the vaccinated person received the shot, and when symptoms and diagnosis happened.</p>
<p>A lot of my friends have received the shot, and some admitted to feeling crappy/sick the first few days after the 2nd shot, and then better afterwards. I read from somewhere that it was labeled a "long term side effect", so I'm hypothesizing that the heart inflammation takes at least a month to show up, maybe a few months, possibly years.</p></p>

        <p>we just don't know - that is part of the problem.  there is just no way of knowing what the long term effects are going to be for any of this!</p>

        <p>How can anyone know? Seriously, how can anyone know? </p>
<p>I don't ask that to be dismissive of your question: this is the scariest part of the vaccines. No one knows what they'll do, because they haven't been around long enough for any long term studies. Is the myocarditis going to be chronic? Degenerative? Acute? A mix of the three for different people?</p>
<p>We'll know in a few years. Until then, no one can know what these things will do to people long term. We can speculate, but unless you have access to a time machine, everything will be guesswork.</p>

        <p>Days-years who knows how this poison works or how long it takes to fuck you up - i have a family member with a heart problem and has a ticker inside his body, he took the vax 4weeks ago and he didnâ€™t have any bad reactions, then i have a couple of young friends in their 30s and they were extremely sick and some are still unable to speak because they lost their voice.. so this is kinda random you can take it and be fine but the chance is not worth it. Donâ€™t take this rat poison please! We dont know what will happened in the next years this shit is still in trials for the next 2 yearsðŸ¤¡</p>

        <p>No one knows - but be aware, once it starts. It doesnâ€™t stop. Once your immune system recognises your organs as a threat, thereâ€™s no stopping it and no cure.</p>
<p>Use that information accordingly</p>

        <p>First 0-6 days according to CDC, the other comments are uninformed nonsense.</p>

        <p>You're not even accurate in quoting the holy CDC. Most typically within 6 days but not all of them have been within that period. Plus you're run into the catch 22 where they will deny it's related to the vaccine if it falls outside the window they deem worthy of investigating. Let's think for a moment, they didn't realize the vaccine would cause myocarditis but you wholeheartedly trust that they know everything about when and how and who will be affected. Blind trust you have there.</p>
