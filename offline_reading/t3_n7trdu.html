        <p>Last weekend, I stopped over at my friends house to visit. She has a 9 year old son. I didn’t have on a mask when I got there, and he ran into his room and called his mom to go into his room. She came back out a minute later and asked me to please put on a mask because her little boy was too afraid. So, we all had to put on masks in order for him to feel comfortable to come out of his room. I did it because he was already scared and I didn’t want to scare him in his own home, but I didn’t stay long. It broke my heart to see this little boy so afraid. My friend said he wears the mask outside and is afraid of anyone who isn’t wearing one. She said she brought him to a park and told him he could take his mask off to go play, and he refused. I feel so bad for children. ☹️</p>

        <p>When you’re in a store? Oh no! But then you’ll take it off and instantly die. But then wearing it for a long time can cause fungal infections. So what do you do? Take off your placebo and think you’re risking yourself to a virus with a 99% survival rate? Or keep your placebo on and create a breeding ground for a fungal infection and breathe it in. Oh and fungal infections are dangerous, less than a 99% survival rate.</p>

        <p>I had cancer and in the hospital they wanted me to wear a mask while walking around (the blue surgical one which can actually help unlike fabric) because I had such a weak immune system. I got multiple fungal infections throughout that time and they weren’t sure why. Years later there was a study and now I know why. So I have first hand experience, and it wasn’t because I was “dirty” it was from the bacteria and moisture building up in a small space then breathing all of it back in. Unless you are constantly washing your mouth out with mouthwash while wearing a mask, it can happen. Plus, I had a weak immune system which made me more susceptible. Like children. Wearing them all day in class.</p>

        <p>This is simply untrue.  There is plenty of evidence that none of these claims happen by wearing a mask.  A decade ago I worked in construction and sometimes wore an N95 mask for 8+ hours a day.  The scare tactics news outlets use is ludicrous.</p>

        <p>It sounds like you guys are brainwashes tbh to believe the nonsense, that masks cause oxygen deficiency. I mean they have literally measured people oxygen levels with masks on, it doesnt change at all. I mean I know you guys want to be antimask, but that doesnt mean you need to support facts which doesnt have an ounce of truth in it for the sake of supporting your narrative, thats just being fanatical.</p>

<p>The fact is the statements in this meme are simply not true.  Also Coronaviruses have been known and in the world since the 60’s so I’m not sure where your statement that it’s been around for 3 years comes from.  COVID-19 is simply a variant with a similar structure.</p>
<p>Side note:  would you tell people to stop using condoms to protect themselves from an STD that has a 99.9% survival rate?  I mean, a penis isn’t meant to be wrapped in latex for any period of time.</p>

        <p>bruh its on the news you trust so much in the ONLY picture in this post.  you do you.  as long as no one tries to force their “ need for a “  mask on me i dont care.  the only time i ever wear a mask is the / 2 seconds i go to buy food or when someone notices and i just take it off after they walk away</p>
<p>people need to stop talking shit and trying to force others to wear masks.  or small children to wear masks.  people wear masks should wear it and mind their own buisness.</p>

<p>mate just stay home if you wanna be unsafe and make people be uncomfortable. Its just sad how its such a small thing and you make it so big. How were you as a child, did you make your parents life hell?</p>

        <p>but its ok when the news does what they always do and tell people to wear a mask.  so the same news you probably watch is now.  bs. even though it Always was Bullshit.  point is the same channell you probably trusted when they said masks where good now its exagurated because they are saying that masks reduce oxygen which is common sense </p>
<p>being unsafe 😂😂 ok sheep</p>
<p>the only thing that is unsafe is complying with the govt blindly.  im done wasting my time replying to this. reddit is the worst when it comes to. people who are completley asleep</p>

fuck masks and i dont wear them.  outside i would say way worse / do way worse to someone getting in my face talking shit to me for not wearing a mask.  excspecially because even after i put it on. and walk far away in a store then take if off they pop out of no where after following me to say “ wear a mask your putting me in danger”</p>
