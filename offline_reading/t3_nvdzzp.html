    <strong>Why should we "trust The Science" when science got us into this mess in the first place?</strong>
    <p><p>Before I get going, you can fuck off with your bat-soup theories, it came from a fucking lab. You're allowed to think and say that now, Facebook and the media says so. Let's look at the facts: they were fucking around with something they shouldn't have been for whatever bullshit reason they could conjure up to justify their need to play God and scratch the itch of their scientific curiosity and now it's (either accidentally or purposefully) been released into the wild and here we fucking find ourselves over a year later: FUCKED.</p>
<p>Not because of the virus, mind you, but the overreaction to it and the lies behind it. Just wanted to clear that up.</p>
<p>Now is the time to STOP implicitly trusting "The Science" and worshipping it like a new religion or cult. Now is the time to fucking question things and do your own research, because this shit is now having a major effect on the way we live our lives, and will do so going forward. We're already hopelessly and pathetically dependent on technology as it is. They're hoping to make us dependent on the "vaccines" next and even that's tied into technology with all the fucking travel apps and QR codes you're going to have to scan to prove you're adequately vaccinated enough to enter somewhere.</p>
<p>There are many fucking reasons they censored the truth of the lab leak early on, but chief among them is the fact that people's faith in "The Science" might have been shaken. More people might have refused to take the rushed, experimental vaccine they're presenting as a miracle elixir and seen it for the poisoned chalice of snake oil and tramp's piss it fucking well is.</p></p>

        <p>OK, take a deep breath.  You are not wrong, but "the science" is not to blame.  You actually put your finger on it</p>
<p>&rt; Now is the time to fucking question things and do your own research</p>
<p>That is science.   What you are told to believe because we said so is a totally different thing. </p>
<p>I do not know what to tell you.  The problem is the full gamut of media and you can't really trust a one to have no ulterior motives. </p>
<p>I firmly believe that science will get us out of this.  Once actual science and not Mintruth is used.</p>
