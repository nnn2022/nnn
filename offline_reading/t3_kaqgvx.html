        <p>Reminds me of my brother to an extent... I just can't bring myself to talk to him any more, he was always pressuring me and putting me down. He's pro government, and pro doctor - he thinks I'm a quack for preferring natural remedies. He also thinks I'm stupid and dramatic for not rescheduling an appointment at a place that refused me for not wearing a mask over my nose because I have asthma. I just can't give in like he can,and the rest of my family, I'm sorry but I won't be a slave to the luciferian elite. </p>
<p>Its lonely knowing the truth but once you've been awakened to the truth you honestly cant go back to sleep.</p>

        <p>I'm in the same boat with my dad. Pretty much yells at me when I bring it up and won't hear. My mom says she won't but I think she'll take it with a little pressure from government or inconvenience. My little brother won't take I think. My youngest brother won't either I think he doesn't talk about it much and just agrees when I say anything about it. Anyway I keep talking about to family and anyone who  will listen. This is a RNA vaccine they skipped so many trials and pushed it out in a year. It takes about 15 years to test a vaccine. They skipped animal trials and are going straight for humans. They test RNA vaccines on rats they have autoimmune response that basically causes them when they get a disease to overheat and shut down killed all the rats and also caused tumors. The vaccine companies are looking for a payday and I have no idea what the government is going for. Anyway my point is anyone who gets this vaccine is fucked for life even if they don't die they will probably have severe health problems down the road and much lowered life expectancy. Even if you family doesn't listen keep trying and tell friends, post posters, go to other subreddit get this information out their anyway you can. It is your moral obligation to.</p>

        <p>I know what you're saying, but I don't think I am obligated to do this anymore. Even if I was, I don't wish to continue trying on them, instead I'll focus my attention on those who will listen. </p>
<p>Just because someone is blood doesn't mean they can treat me like crap, I wouldn't let a stranger do me the way they have, so why allow them just because we are kin? </p>
<p>I deal with panic attacks daily, I honestly can't take anymore of their stress, I pretty much went low contact with them. Meaning I no longer call them, if I do reach out to them it will be through snail mail. </p>
<p>I love them, I tried to warn them, but ultimately the choice is theirs, I can't make them listen to me. If they choose to take the poison, they'll just have to lay in the bed they made. I have a husband and an autistic daughter, I can't let them or anyone else stress me out which in turn would affect my little family I have got going on. I'm basically a firm believer in "leave and cleave", when I married I took I vow to choose my new family over my blood and in laws if need be. </p>
<p>In the end my family and my inlaws was the one who pushed me away, I won't let the blame be on me, trust me I've tried everything. I've offered to open my home to both sides, I've offered to help get them land and a place to stay so we can all work together through this but they will not listen to me.</p>

<p>Well I am not you. Sounds like your family treats you worse then mine about this. If you still trust the government and media at this point hell if you trusted it a year ago you are a total moron who is not paying the slightest bit of attention. Use you best judgment. Yes, the choice is everyone's at the end of the day. But you still should be trying to tell other people about this.</p>

        <p>Also the Prince Phillip was incredibly close with Jimmy Savile. They are on record calling each really good friends and although many of them have been scrubbed, there is and was a shit ton of photos of them together. Savile was even brought in as a “marriage guidance counsellor” for Diana’s relationship. </p>
<p>The royal family are complicit in all of this, you think they were unaware of all the police reports that were buried about Savile doing absolutely unthinkable things to children? Pfft.</p>
