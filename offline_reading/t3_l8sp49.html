    <strong>People who say "I supported this at the start but..." drive me crazy</strong>
    <p><p>It's these people - who happily played along with having their basic rights suspended because they thought it was just for a short period of time - that allowed this whole thing to happen.</p>
<p>Anyone, who thought any of this was justified, for any period of time shares some of the blame.</p>
<p>You need to work damned hard to scrub that stink off of yourself. You should be on the front line of every march, phone drive, and online petition.</p></p>

        <p>I never really “supported” it, but I’m not too proud to admit I was pretty terrified at the beginning and barely left the house for about a month except to go to work and get groceries and booze and go for walks by myself. I was also among the first to start wearing masks, but that was a personal choice and I never advocated for it to be mandatory. </p>
<p>However, this is when I thought this was an actual plague that could kill anyone at random. I never shamed or judged anyone else for anything they did, even when I was at my most paranoid. It was the shaming and virtue signaling that eventually caused me to come around because I can’t stand that shit, along with coming to the conclusion that I probably had covid before it was known to be in the US (after talking to the person who thinks they “gave it to me” based on travel history.)</p>
<p>It’s a good thing for people to be on our side, regardless of how they felt in the past. I don’t want to gatekeep being anti-new normal and am willing to forgive - I want as many people on our side as possible.</p>

        <p>My husband and I swear we had it last Feb 2020. We both got super sick which is unusual for us. His was 2 weeks long and a really bad upper respiratory. He says to this day he swears we both had covid. Plot twist: we lived. Seems like everyone else swears you'll die if you get it.</p>

        <p>My mother and father both died from this. So yes, in some people and it honestly seems ultra-chaotic, it will kill you.</p>
<p>That said I was never for the mandatory lockdowns nor masking. I thought it should be left to the people whether they were willing to take the risk.</p>

        <p>I didn’t agree with lockdowns. I already said that. I still welcome anyone in our movement who wants to be here regardless of what they thought in the past. Strength in numbers. People make mistakes, change and grow as time goes on. I don’t want this to be an exclusive sector cell thing. It needs to be as mainstream as possible and that means welcoming everyone without question. Because we are on the right side of history.</p>

        <p>Same, at first it was such an unknown I was worried, stopped working, isolated. A month later I was like sod this and got back to work and was becoming more stressed about the restrictions than the actual virus. Just using my own eyes, a bit of research, the over the top media circus and a play about with a calculator was enough for me in the end to realise this was being overblown.</p>

        <p>No, I’m sorry but this type of attitude towards our fellow brothers and sisters is simply unacceptable. To degrade someone down to that level without even knowing them is precisely why the majority of us have felt on the verge of a mental breakdown, myself included. To know that people feel that way towards you.....it may not effect you the first day, second week or month. But eventually it weighs on someone. I didn’t intend to sound like a preacher but I’m not going back and changing shit I wrote. Do what you want, but i think that attitude is truly wrong.</p>

        <p>No one really knew anything at the beginning. They were just bombarded with 24/7 media propaganda fearmongering, so I can understand why some people were okay with the "2 weeks to slow the spread", not that I agreed with it in any way I knew this was bull from the beginning, but I can understand why many people were terrified of this virus the media was telling us was sooooo deadly while showing images of people in hazmat suits in March/April.</p>
<p>Now though, nearly a year into this nonsense there is no excuse to still play along with this. And that's what I see a whole lot of people doing - still playing along. Wearing their masks, playing the part. The compliance of the majority has ultimately allowed this to go on for so long. Now there's talk of 2 masks and anal swabbing, combined with these passports and it's getting more insane by the day.</p>

        <p>Don't shit on those people, man.  They're very important.</p>
<p>I remember starting to ask questions later last year.  Before that I believed there was a legitimate public health crisis that necessitated the response.  Hell, I even went to get tested after a night of partying in August because I had symptoms.  Then later after testing negative I figured those symptoms were probably from doing mushrooms and getting hammered in the rain.</p>

There is the idea that anyone who questions things is an idiot, and that was established very early on. A little more critical debate would have helped immensely and we wouldn't have this huge iceberg to break down.</p>
<p>I don't understand why it was so transparent to some people and not to others.  I was never even a big conspiracy guy, but right from March everything just felt so wrong.</p>

        <p>Yes and as I've said in reply to someone else, who said 'well there was a lot of fear at the time':</p>
<p>They were pushing the idea that it had a 4% death rate.</p>
<p>I don't care whether it's 10, 50, or 90%.</p>
<p>The issue here isn't whether Covid was serious enough to justify this, it's that my rights are non-negotiable. Full stop. Otherwise it's just a government privilege.</p>

        <p>I agree these people bother me a lot. But at least some of them have opened their eyes. Our job is to convince everyone else that’s still clinging to the idea that lockdowns are a good idea.</p>

        <p>We have to remember that fear drives us to make a lot of our decisions. Historically stepping out from the herd makes us vulnerable to pray. It’s in our neurobiology, to want to fit in to want to be a part of the community. It’s in our neurobiology to be safe to do this we stay close to others in our community and do what they’re doing. Many people make decisions at a fearing the worst case scenario “better safe than sorry “.“Unfortunately, it’s very hard to believe you’ve been lied to. It’s easier to believe a lie. So many of these people reallyDo you believe in what they’re doing. Even the doctors and nurses who were taught medical practices under germ theory, they think they’re doing well by administering immunizations and giving these directives. When we know better we do better. But sometimes even when we know better we are scared to do better because it’s stepping out from the herd and that makes us feel unsafe.</p>

        <p>Putting blame on people now doesn't win hearts and minds, please don't use the same emotional manipulation that is currently used to silence critics. Welcome those that change their minds with opens arms, it takes a lot of courage to admit when one is wrong.</p>

        <p>Yeah. They’re just trying to protect their egos from embarrassment. Cut them some slack, at least they’ve come around. Hopefully won’t be as easily fooled next time. </p>

        <p>That sounds dangerously like the other side.  At the start of this thing, all I heard from ALL media outlets  (not just msm) was how deadly this is, how we don't  know anything about  it because  it was a "novel" illness.   I have elderly family parents, m dad has cancer plus other health conditions, and I work retail, where I'm around a lot of people daily.   Am I  to blame for wanting to do anything in my power to protect them from an unknown disease?  I imagine a lot of people felt the same. </p>
<p>However,  as time went by and things started not making sense,  I, and others, begin questioning.   I  do still voluntarily wear a mask when shopping  and I have to  wear one at work, but I don't support mask mandates or lockdowns.  We're all supposed to be adults; treat us like adults.</p>

<p>There's the key line, though.</p>
<p>You would not have been to blame for doing anything in your power to protect them.</p>
<p>And if that's all you did, my post isn't aimed at you.</p>
<p>But if you agreed with the govt, wherever you are, systematically removing the basic rights of everyone to make you feel safer, that's a whole different story.</p>

        <p>You gotta understand most people were comatose before all of this. They believed in politics or that Trump or Biden was going to save them. Hell people on here in the beginning thought Trump was going to save them, some still do. It's all a fucking scam and a big lie. If you believed in politics, ISIS, or that China and the US actually hate each other you got another thing coming. International bankers are running this shit. This is the final move. People seriously need to wake up.</p>
