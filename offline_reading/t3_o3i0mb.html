        <p>Tell that to my Jewish grandma who survived  the Nazi occupation of her country of Europe. She makes the comparison to what we see now to when the Nazis occupied. Do you think everyone knew that they were brutally murdering millions people? That it was common knowledge?</p>
<p>No. But they did know that police were on every street corner asking for papers (which is what the doomers desperately advocate for), that they government  had strict economic control (like now, when they force businesses), strong power over the media (which is what we see now— anyone who disagrees is ostracized and shamed and humiliated), and strong social control (throwing people in jail for breaking curfew, seeing their families, etc). </p>
<p>Furthermore, the Nazis started to take power in 1930. The Holocaust didn’t start until 1941. Hitler took power in 1933. Meaning there’s was <em>eight years</em> of him being an authoritarian before he gassed people. Remember, Anne Frank lived a semi normal life in the Netherlands for a while before the government went after her friends and family. </p>
<p>You need to pick up a history book.</p>
