    <strong>Not Being Able To See Your Loved One.</strong>
    <p><p>Not sure if this is the best place to post this. My mom called today to say her mom is most likely not going to live past the next few days. My mom is currently in mandatory quarantine due to exposure from almost a week ago. She shows no symptoms yet can't go see her mother as she lays dying. I wasn't close to my grandma, but my heart hurts for my mom.</p></p>

        <p>This is the bullshit I can't deal with. </p>
<p>My wife is a doctor in an ICU facility. One of her nurses was crying at a desk on Thursday. She told my wife that she just found out her grandfather had a stroke. He lives in Connecticut. Her entire family lives there apparently. She couldn't go up there to be with him because Connecticut has travel restrictions for people who travel there from where we live. The nurse would've been required to quarantine for 2 damn weeks before being able to even see her grandfather. She couldn't take that amount of time off work. Her grandfather passed away earlier today.</p>
<p>So, not only is this a horrible thing for everyone involved, it is made worse by shit like I saw today. There were herds of people crowded together in DC, paying their respects to RBG, a woman none of them ever met or knew personally. DC is supposed to have travel restrictions and traveler quarantine rules, similar to Connecticut. I'm sure most people were from the city but, I am sure there were some that are not from the area. Obviously, exceptions were happily made for this situation.</p>
<p>Today was much like the George Floyd and Elijah Cummimgs funerals. They forgot the rules that everyone are told to follow. They didn't really care. Exceptions were made.</p>
<p>These are examples of things that tell me we are not in the middle of the worst pandemic in history. The lack of consistency we see in the rules and behaviors are all I need to witness. I just wish more people were able to see it the same way.</p>
<p>The bottom line, and what makes this specific thing sad, much like everything else, the rules and guidelines and mandates are completely unnecessary at this point. The people that created them, the same.people who never adhere to them themselves, don't seem to care that a loved ones death only happens once.</p>

        <p>That is such fucking bullshit. Both OP's and your coworker's stories. Even people on death row get a last meal (and I assume, visitors if any will bother), but these dying old folks can't see their kids one last time because of security theater for tHe DeAdLiEsT vIrUs Of AlL tImE.</p>

        <p>When I see the protests and the public funerals and gatherings and people say "they're allowed because everyone was social distancing and wearing masks", it feels like we are being gaslighted</p>

        <p>It's worth asking whether it's time to start outright lying.</p>
<p>There is so much malicious, fradulent misinformation being spread right now for selfish, malicious reasons. It's causing harm at a massive scale to so many innocent people.</p>
<p>A little untruth for a compassionate, humanitarian reason, where nobody is put at any meaningful risk, just might be the most noble, moral action someone could take right now.</p>

        <p>Lying isn't wrong if some brainwashed evil crazy is going to ruin your life for being honest and normal. That's like saying violence is wrong for defending yourself.</p>

        <p>I lost my dad to cancer in April and since I live abroad, I wasn't able to go home to say goodbye to him in person. I had to do it over Facetime. Even if I had gone home, I would have faced a 14 day quarantine before being allowed to enter the hospital.. basically, I wouldn't have made it anyway. It was hell. Luckily my mom was there with him but I should have been there too.</p>
