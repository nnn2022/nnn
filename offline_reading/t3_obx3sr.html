        <p>And anti-tiranny as is, it's hard to keep discussing this with a rabid mob who thinks that I should vax with an old vaccine that might work like a placebo for this year's outbreak, not to mention it was never WHO-approved in the first place.</p>
<p>Even funnier, some governors claim that it's ok to host thousands of graduates for an event in these conditions and think that the following infection spike is a "coincidence".</p>

        <p>Anti forced/coerced vaccine. I’m a fan of letting people take experimental products if they have all the info and can weigh the decision on their own. Im against making these products de facto required to do your job, go to school, have social circles etc.</p>

        <p>I used to be indifferent because 2 years ago that topic played absolutely 0 role in my life as the last time I was vaccinated against something was in 2001.</p>
<p>But now that this topic was put in the spotlight, I, of course couldn't help but looking at content about it.</p>
<p>And after watching "Profiteure der Angst" (profiteers of fear) and "Vaxxed 2", I never want to get vaccinated against anything ever again.</p>

        <p>Seems like a bit of a leading question with predetermined narratives. I'm not anti. In actuality I'm pro- hey let's have a free exchange of information and discussion so we can make informed risk decisions.... But this stance doesn't seem to be acceptable anymore... I've said a bunch of times, I think the virus is real, that it's capable of killing some people, and that the various vaccines are likely a wise choice for people in certain risk categories.... And yet, I've still been auto-banned by other subs for the high crime of being a participant in this sub. It is the digital version of tearing out our tongue. Any position that is not one thousand percent in line with particular narratives is now enough to have us deemed a health hazard by mods...</p>

        <p>I realize now my wording was pretty bad. I get that it's more about not having a choice than it is about the actual vaccine.  </p>
<p>I also wish we lived in a world where people had the space to think for themselves, having discussions, stating their fears and having access to unbiased information without being bombarded with whatever extremist garbage is being preached on social media. There's no space for nuance these days eh</p>
<p>I was banned from insanepeoplefacebook just for participating here, and I don't even agree with a lot of the views found here. I literally just want to see views different from my own.</p>

        <p>How else would you temper  your arguments made, see what works and what doesn't, and maybe learn something you may not have considered before?<br>
That's the great thing about discussion vs censorship.</p>
<p>No one said we would have to agree, but there is benefit to UNDERSTANDING why the other person holds the view they do.</p>

        <p>Anti-covid and anti-forced vaccine. I’m in a weird place as a parent now. When Commifornia announced all kids has to be vaccinated in order to attend public school (and they banned medical and religious exemptions) I was pissed, the government has no right forcing us to vaccinate our children or ourselves especially in order to get an education, something our kids have a RIGHT TO. But I dutifully vaccinated my kids. My oldest got intussusception from the first round of the rotovirus vaccine so we did decline the 2nd jab. My youngest I think we did get him the vaccine. Anyway, in 7th grade kids have to get some booster vaccines so last summer I had to make my
Oldest get some vaccines and boy did I struggle with that! I put it off as long as possible because I hated the fact that i had to force her to put something in her body she did not want. I know as parents we are the decision makers and have to decide what’s best but as a mother, I am trying to raise my daughter to be a strong independent women who is a leader not a follower. She’s at an age where I am teaching her autonomy and “my body my choice”. The booster shots she got last summer, personally I don’t think kids need them. It’s just another way to get you in to the drs office where they try to get you jab your kids with MORE vaccines. I was heavily pressured in to getting her the HPV vaccine which I declined and will continue to decline. If the school hadn’t been up my ass to give them proof she got the boosters, I wouldn’t have made her get them. So yeah I am very much against forced vaccines. It should be unconstitutional to force you get a vaccine in order to go to school or keep your job!</p>

        <p>I'm fully vaccinated. I just never get flu shots because i dont think they do much, I am never sick anyway and the small chance of getting the flu or flu like symptoms form the vaccine is not worth it and probably worse than any real organic flu i might get.   </p>
<p>Similarly with the covid vaccine. Fact is the research isnt in on this vaccine yet. And according to an Oxford calculator too I have a 0,0003 chance of death and a 0,0118 change of hospitalization if i get actual covid.  Meanwhile if i get a vaccine that we know not much about who know what the statistics even are. Certainly not the scientists with their only-half-complete trials. </p>
<p>So I'd be more of a hypocrite if I did take the vaccine than I am for not taking it.  Plus the vaccine doenst even guaranteed protect you. So I'd be rolling the dice of risk twice. Risk getting something of a reaction from the vaccine that might fuck me up plus the risk of still getting covid after it.  Why should I?  </p>
<p>I got the vax for Whooping cough as a kid and still got bad whooping cough, which i wouldnt wish on anyone. So I know about vaccines not always working. </p>
<p>I am gonna wait a good while more before i consider getting this vaccine. When the vaccine for Cervical-neck Cancer came out in my country I was of the right age to be in the first group of young girls to get it. But that vaccine too was doubtful in those early stages with a lot of side effect being reported. I waited about a year or a little more to get that vaccine to let some time go by for the developers to find answers and give explanations and make changes.</p>
<p>I plan to do the same here. I'm gonna wait at least a year or longer, preferably until 2023 to see what happens with this vaccine. Then I'll reconsider.</p>
