        <p>Doesn't surprise me and it terrifies me. And they wonder why we don't trust anyone pushing the vaccine. Well bc saying anything other than "get it, it's 100% safe and effective" leads to being reported and losing your medical license. </p>
<p>I read a post on there from a young male who said his doctor had advised him not to get it. The responses were all report him, he should lose his license. And they see nothing wrong with that. </p>
<p>Like all the experts agree it's safe and if they don't we cancel them, why don't you trust the experts???ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

        <p>I think that OP is fucked in their head. They think that someone who has a different  opinion should be ... what exactly? Not allowed to have an opinion? Fired or "re-educated"?</p>
<p>The guy is supposed to be an educated member of society, a doctor. And yet, they can't even articulate why they should be reporting the other doctor or to what end. They can</p>
<p>"I did my best to encourage them to get it. I shared that I had and that my oldest child had. I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôll do."</p>
<p>But if their colleague:</p>
<p>"The provider (to my knowledge) has not outrightly told anyone not to get vaccinated, but has made it really clear where they stand on the issue."</p>
<p>essentially does exactly what they do, then that's bad and someone should do something! </p>
<p>"It feels incredibly irresponsible to me"</p>

        <p>I think we have massive retardation in our populace. I dont even mean that to be rude. </p>
<p>These concepts are some of the most easy, simple to comprehend, and yet as we see each day, people just CAN'T understand.</p>
<p>I wonder if it's related to the internet where we all get to speak on any topic at any time. We get to be right. We get to put people in there place. We get to read some articles and become as much of an expert as anyone.</p>
<p>In our head.</p>
<p>What else can explain this level of "I'm going to inflict pain because I think person is wrong" effect we see constantly?</p>

        <p>this guy is evil and stupid, instead of assuming the doctor is wrong and lying, why doesn't he think anything out? The doctors are scared to talk, one can tell, and I think many of them are SEEING the BAD RESULTS of the poison.</p>

        <p>Any profession that sports the Caduceus as their official emblem should be given long, sideways stares as they are passed in public, IMO. Perhaps flashing a cross at them might even be prudent.</p>
<p>Other, bolder people might apprehend their symbology as a statement of who they serve and what they are and run them out of their communities.</p>
