    <strong>Understanding the other side...</strong>
    <p><p>I make an effort to also read mainstream doomer subs so that I don't fall out of touch with how the majority is feeling. This understanding of the other side, in turn, should help the sharpening of our own arguments. Lo and behold, today I was struck by a short comment in /r/CoronavirusCanada because in a few words it seems to encapsulate a whole worldview and way of thinking. 
In response to the comment...
&rt;I doubt the people of Ontario would consent to another lockdown, if a vote was held. Whether or not the government does it anyway, that really just depends on how far into authoritarian dystopia we've descended.</p>
<p>...the reply I bring to your attention was: 
&rt;What does consent have to do with it? People largely didn't consent to seatbelts or helmet laws either; because most people are idiots.</p>
<p>&rt;Sometimes it's necessary to make (and enforce) decisions to protect people from themselves. That's not dystopian, that's literally what a government is supposed to do.</p>
<p>&rt;What IS dystopian is a government killing 200,000+ of it's own people in order to preserve their imagined freedums.</p>
<p>I was left speechless...</p>

        <p>Yeah no there’s been multiple wars fought to keep the government from doing what it’s doing right now. The life I lived until March was not imagined freedom. It was pure freedom and it was taken. And I will gladly water the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants even if some of my own blood is mixed into that if it means my niece’s and nephews get the same life I just lived for 31 years. These kids don’t have a fucking clue what they’re talking about and I don’t want them to experience what a lack of freedom really is but I do wish they would get a grip. Millions from other countries don’t beat down the door of the US every year for perceived freedoms. They beat down the door for guaranteed freedoms. Fuck anyone who wants to decide otherwise.</p>

        <p>WELL that's just not true. I mean, I don't know about the adjective "authoritarian" because i don't know that most parts of the country are strictly enforcing anything regarding mask wearing or if there is a mandate of some kind most don't have any teeth - no fines or jail time. </p>
<p>Even if they were strictly enforcing compliance to their authority, we as a society - DID have come to consensus on and our elected representatives voted for emergency power to be in the hands of governors and the president and carry the force of law.  Pick a state, i'll be happy to find the law for you so you can stop pretending like this is nazi germany just because someone asked you to wear a mask.  </p>
<p>Feel free to vote, especially in your next local election, for the guy who will never mandate masks. </p>

<p>Ironically, I came here for the opposite of what OP did.  Let me say just because your personal experience doesn't include your death or any one you know, 200k+ other people have not been as lucky.  Why don't you go visit the people in /r/COVID19positive/ for some kind of perspective. </p>

        <p>Here's a quote from a recent ruling from a federal judge on the matter:</p>
<p>&rt;"The liberties protected by the Constitution are not fair-weather freedoms -- in place when times are good but able to be cast aside in times of trouble," Stickman wrote. "There is no question that this country has faced, and will face, emergencies of every sort. But the solution to a national crisis can never be permitted to supersede the commitment to individual liberty that stands as the foundation of the American experiment. The constitution cannot accept the concept of a 'new normal' where the basic liberties of the people can be subordinated to open-ended emergency mitigation measures..."</p>

        <p>commenting too much apparently</p>
<p>What case? what judge? when? Link?</p>
<p>Here is the original law straight from the fed gov printing office https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg1255.pdf</p>
<p>Here's a list of 31 emergency declarations that have been going on for ~~YEARS~~ DECADES https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/NEA%20Declarations.pdf</p>
<p>See also: https://psmag.com/news/the-united-states-states-of-emergencies  (where's outrage for the boarder wall emergency?)</p>
<p>So....I mean Idk what to tell you. The idea that emergency declarations don't go on is SIMPLY NOT TRUE IN AMERICAN LAW AND SOCIETY.</p>
<p>The judge you quoted but didn't cite doesn't have more power than congress.  If what his opinion was had any weight, there wouldn't be 31 "new normal" emergencies going on now and he would have stamped them out.</p>

        <p>Here's a great explanation of why that judge is a dumbass https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/09/pa-coronavirus-orders-tom-wolf-unconstitutional-legal-analysis-john-roberts/
He's basically ignoring a century of other case law, and the fact that the order was no longer in effect anyway, and the federal judge on the other side of town with a similar case who ruled that it WAS constitutional.</p>
<p>https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/NEA%20Declarations.pdf  See this for a long list with links to emergency declarations that have been going on for decades.</p>
<p>Let me say it again, the idea that emergency declarations don't go on for a longer period of time than a few months is <em>ahem</em> </p>
<p>&rt; FALSE</p>
<p>It's false in the law, it's false in practice, its premise is false because you suppose that the people declaring said emergencies or the ones who wrote the emergency declaration laws were (somehow?) not voted into office.</p>
<p>What else is there to say?</p>

        <p>Are you arguing that governors and the president have the right to make unchecked laws for indeterminate amounts of time? If that is the case, why do we have legislative bodies at the state and federal level? This position seems nonsensical to me so maybe I'm misunderstanding your position.</p>
<p>&rt;Emergency powers aren't meant to exist for months on end without legislative review.</p>
<p>You implied my comment above is untrue. Here are the laws in several states where legislative review is explicitly given the ability to override the governor or where it's required after a specific time limit.</p>

<p><strong>Alaska</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt;A proclamation of disaster emergency may not remain in effect longer than 30 days unless extended by the legislature by a concurrent resolution.</p>
<p><strong>Arizona</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt;The powers granted the governor by this chapter with respect to a non-state of war emergency shall terminate by proclamation of the governor or by concurrent resolution of the legislature declaring it at an end. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 26-303.</p>

<p>&rt;Emergency executive orders issued by the Mayor shall be effective for no more than 15 calendar days from the day it is signed by the Mayor. Such orders may be extended for up to an additional 15-day period, only upon request by the Mayor of, and the adoption of, an emergency act by the Council of the District of Columbia. Section c-1 of this statute grants a unique 90-day extension specific to the COVID-19 public health emergency. DC ST § 7-2306.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt;The Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may terminate a state of emergency at any time. Fla. Stat. Ann. § 252.36.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia</strong>:</p>

Rescission shall be effective upon filing of the concurrent resolution or resolution of the legislative council with the secretary of state. Iowa Code Ann. § 29C.3. A virtually identical provision exists for disaster emergency proclamations, located at Iowa Code Ann. § 29C.6.</p>
<p><strong>Kansas</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt;No state of disaster emergency may continue for longer than 15 days unless ratified by concurrent resolution of the legislature, with the single exception that upon specific application by the governor to the state finance council and an affirmative vote of a majority of the legislative members thereof, a state of disaster emergency may be extended once for a specified period not to exceed 30 days beyond such 15-day period.

<p><strong>Missouri</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt;Any emergency shall terminate upon the proclamation thereof by the governor, or the passage by the legislature, of a resolution terminating such emergency. Mo. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 44.100.</p>

Any such emergency, whether proclaimed by the governor or by the Legislature, shall terminate upon the proclamation of the termination thereof by the governor, or by passage by the Legislature of a concurrent resolution terminating such emergency. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 63, § 683.9.</p>

        <p>gtg, but yeah all those allow for extension of an emergency for an indeterminate amount of time.  </p>
<p>Idk what you're getting at? They have the power to squash something the governor or president does? when was that ever called into question?  State and Fed legislature even have the power to remove those executives from office.  That doesn't mean that they can't issue executive orders declaring an emergency and that it can't legally exist for a longer period of time than a few months.</p>

        <p>We're talking passed each other or maybe arguing semantics. My position has been that governors and presidents don't have the right to create authoritarian edicts that go unchecked for indeterminate amounts of time.</p>
<p>&rt;gtg, but yeah all those allow for extension of an emergency for an indeterminate amount of time.</p>
<p>That's not true. In many cases they can <em>only</em> be extended with explicit legislative approval. I encourage you to re-read them more closely. But in the rest of the cases at least implicit approval is required otherwise they could be terminated at any time.</p>

        <p>Yeah but they CAN be extended for an indeterminate amount of time, no? It is legal for that to happen in the United States of america? Emergency declarations lasting more than 6 months? That's a thing that exists with legislative oversight (some more than others). </p>
<p>I mean, the legislature makes the laws. They could always just write a new law that says the governor doesn't have emergency powers anymore. I suppose the Congress and Senate also have that power over the president. I was never saying that that didn't exist. </p>
<p>look I don't want to be in my house for a long period of time anymore than anybody else does. I hate fucking grocery shopping anymore. I'm really tired of cooking as much as I have been. I don't particularly want to work from home, especially when I am here with my daughter and trying to do her school stuff and my work at the same time. It's insane. </p>
<p>But my daughter has a disease called neimann pick type c -Don't worry if you've never heard of it before. File it under a list of things you didn't know that you should be horrified of. Now imagine, dealing with that and all of the difficulty of that when one half of society thinks it's no big deal if they don't wear a mask or follow quarantine or send their kids to school sick or whatever.  The real irony of what you're saying is that the US was never actually on lockdown. You guys are bitching about nothing. </p>
<p>I've yet to see a part of the United States that is taking this is seriously as New York and Michigan. And I don't live in either one of those states. In fact, I live in a part of the country where people were protesting outside of the grocery store when I left yelling at me that I shouldn't be wearing a mask and I was some kind of "pawn of the oppressor" - also something about Hillary Clinton and some pedo sex ring. Yes, really. </p>
<p>They still don't have a complete understanding of everything that's involved with my daughter's disease. The last thing I want is to have that compounded by any of the ill effects of covid 19. For example, she's got a weight problem. Specifically she has a problem gaining weight and often refuses to eat. What do you think her losing her sense of taste for a few months might do? </p>
<p>You have the gaul to say I'm being obtuse.</p>

<p>Simple: I know they're unconstitutional, because I've read the Bill of Rights and know that there is nowhere in that document that allows for an exception based on an emergency aside from war and insurrection. It's words, not mine.</p>

        <p>It doesn't have to do any of those things and it certainly doesn't pay for health care.</p>
<p>Oh, and congratulations, you just explained the conservative counterargument to free health care -- you'd just use it as an excuse to take away people's rights and abuse them, which has been their concern with all of these policies the left has wanted the whole time.</p>
<p>Just because government pays for those things doesn't mean it has the right to force people to lower their personal risk anyway. It's here to serve <em>us,</em> we don't owe anything to <em>it.</em> It's <em>our</em> playtoy. It is there to enable us to take high personal risk and to help mitigate the consequences of our choices, not to force us to make good choices for a better outcome. Nowhere ever was civil rights ever about a positive outcome in anything -- the positive outcome is in the presence and exercise of our civil rights, and all negative outcomes are things we as individuals are supposed to have the resiliency to overcome. That's how a free country works.</p>
<p>Don't like it, go to Russia or China where the exact same things you've been stewing about still happen, and in fact happen more often and with the benefits of censorship to cover up, making the problems you're trying to deal with even worse.</p>

        <p>I saw a good argument regarding seat belt laws, that they aren't entirely necessary and that the market was going that way anyway. Just look at other non mandated safety features like front and side air bags. Safety rating is 100% a value add for the customer. </p>

        <p>But is r/coronavirus the majority?  Sure there are a lot more people than r/nonewnormal, but I would argue that because of Reddit’s user base...Reddit has never been known (to my knowledge) as a “quorum of scholars,” so I take ~~crazy~~ clinically insane responses with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>I don’t post that much on Reddit or other social media because <strong><em>I actually have something to lose</em></strong> - a good job, amazing family, comfortable home, etc.  I believe there are A LOT more of us out there. I have a FB account that I never use to post, but I scroll through some comments on political posts <em>that are public</em> and don’t understand how these people don’t think it will impact them in the future (whether career, family/friends, etc.). The only reason I can think is because 1) they have nothing else to do...like work... and 2) their public, disgusting comments won’t actually impact them like it would me (or others).</p>
<p>I guess a long way of saying that I’m still banking on the silent majority that actually has a moral compass.  These maskholes are bored, depressed, and beg for more control because they’ve got nothing better to do...  </p>
<p>Keep up the good fight y’all!</p>

        <p>In my heart, I believe there are many people against this. However, like you said, people are scared to lose their jobs, friends etc... and that's exactly the problem, they're scared. The sound of pro-lockdowners is deafening on social media, to the point where I've wondered how many of them are bots. Accounts are getting shut down for misinformation.

        <p>I think these people do care about human rights, but they care about their safety a lot more, so when safety and freedom collide they reflexively scurry toward safety, even if the gain in safety is a lot smaller than the loss in freedom. People like us, meanwhile, are inclined to agree with Judge Strickman’s statement that freedom is not just for fair-weather times.</p>

        <p>okay dummy, if people are so fucking useless and dumb so as to not be able to manage their own affairs why would we want them forming government which is essentially a monopoly on the use of force? this idiot forgets that government doesn't really exist, but <em>people</em> do.</p>

        <p>Your idea to try to understand "the other side"  is a great one.  If more people employed this in more situations in life, well life would go a lot smoother. </p>
<p>I was in practically the same discussion in person (gasp! yes, we were talking outside in person)  and the exact same analogy of seatbelts and helmets came up. It's a fascinating mindset.  It seems to start from the belief in government as some deus ex machina to end all problems.  You were driving too fast and got in an accident and were injured?  Lost your job?  Kids are acting up and disbehaving?  Well the government should make you well.  We owe it to you.   </p>
<p>If you offer that you support personal responsibility in addition to personal freedom, the argument becomes that some people simply won't do that, and we need to take care of them.  And the rules need to be the same for everybody.</p>
<p>And pretty soon, at the bottom of this 80 degree pitch Wesson-oil covered slope you reach the conclusion that the government simply must tell everyone what to do in all situations.</p>

        <p>American but I recall we were involved in many wars that ended up killing more people than covid ever has, yet no one had this attitude. Also those 200k very few percentage of that were healthy people under 60.</p>

        <p>What these privileged twats who probably work remotely now or live with mommy and daddy don't understand is the long term unintended consequences of these shut downs.</p>
<p>It's going to take years to recover from the economic damage done from this. And since this shit started, my uncle had trouble finding treatment for his cancer (mostly because it was so advanced, but also bc of COVID), another older friend (40s) died of a heart attack, my best bud's dad had to wait 6 extra weeks to get a colonoscopy because they are only doing them once a month instead of weekly now, etc... I've known 4 people personally who got COVID (2 couples) and now at least 5 others who are friends or relatives of friends who got it. All of them were fine.</p>
<p>At this point though, fuck it. Let the authoritarian initiatives continue. Keep pushing the populace to their breaking point. I've been on the scorched earth side of things for a bit now. Our institutions are failing. At least this will accelerate the death of our bullshit bureaucratic ridden cesspool.</p>
<p>The sooner you accept that this is turning into an all out culture war, the better off you will be.</p>
