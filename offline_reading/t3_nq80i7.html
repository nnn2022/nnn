        <p>My dad got the vaccine about 2 weeks ago. Well he just got out of the hospital for 5 days because he had a blood clot in his kidney, which caused an infection that spilled into his blatter, and eventually spread through his blood and he went into septic shock. He was violently shaking and throwing up. He was in terrible shape. Both his kidneys shut down and he wasn't getting any toxins out of his body. The tiny bit he was urinating was pure blood. Super scary. </p>
<p>The doctors were actually entertaining the possibility of it being related to the vaccine, but they eventually said it was unlikely because his platelets were normal, and people who were dying from blood clots had really high platelets. Regardless, it still seems a little too much of a coincidence that he was seemingly fine for the longest time (the last time he was even sick was Dec 18 when we both had Covid), gets the vaccine, and then he nearly dies within a week. </p>
<p>I'd get your Mom to the hospital if she gets any worse. We waited a few days because he initially didn't want to go, but we definitely shouldn't have.</p>

        <p>Thx for sharing. This shot is absolutely destroying people's lives and the whole circle they inhabit. Between doctor appointments, traumatic episodes at the ER, test after test after scan after blood work, back home, then back to the hospital. All the while, the bills are just stacking up. </p>
<p>No wonder the doctors don't want to say anything bad about the shot. BUSINESS HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER.</p>

        <p>You can either: Contact her primary doctor &amp; describe her condition, or take her to the emergency room. Many people have had bad side effects (including me).</p>

        <p>I'm that age. Feel bad for you. My SIL just took it. My wife and I are anxiously awaiting what happens next. We are going to lose at least one family member to the shot, we can both feel it. SIL claims she isn't feeling that great so we will see. Her only reason for taking it was to travel. People are so vacuous, just like our culture.</p>
