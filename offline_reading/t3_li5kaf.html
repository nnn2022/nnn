        <p>The first version(s) of this passport are ment to fail, because a paper passport, a card, an app on your phone etc. are all able to be faked.</p>
<p>"Man and woman caught traveling with fake vaccine passports"</p>
<p>Headlines like that will soon appear, and people will be shamed more, because we're dealing with a 'killer virus' here (/s) and people who fake a vaxx passport are obviously a threat.</p>
<p>So, what then will be the 'solution'? <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lgzob9/its_all_about_the_vaccination_passport/">This</a>.</p>

        <p>I wish I would've saved all the posts made by people who said passports or something similar would eventually be required to participate in daily life. "You're a crazy right wing conspiracy believer" and "Why are you spreading misinformation, asshole" was how most of the comments and replies went. </p>
<p>A covid passport or some kind of digital certificate, proving we have been vaccinated, has always been one of the main objectives that was going to be achieved at one point or another. In doing so, the mask issue will invert. Those who have been vaccinated will be given their papers. Those who are not will have to wear a mask at all times. We will have true mask enforcers walking around, tasked with stopping anyone not wearing a mask and checking to see if they have proof of vaccination. So, all those who are currently masked all day, everyday will become the maskless. And, anyone wearing a mask will be treated as a disease ridden leper. We will wake up one day and, just like that, we will be ostracized and harassed for having to wear masks. The psychological effect it will have on people will push many over the edge.</p>
<p>The control mechanism is being augmented. It has been constructed around us over the last 20 or so years. We've been too distracted by the fights our rulers tell us we're supposed to engage in, to notice how big it was getting. The invisible virus and the unreasonable fear of it, has millions of people begging for the control mechanism to be finished and fully functional, to keep us all protected from the scary germs and all its variants. </p>
<p>I've come to hate what has and is continuing to happen. I was surprised. Then I was annoyed. And, now I have disdain for everything and everyone who is participating in the creating the kind of world be will soon be forced to live in.</p>

        <p>Oh boy. Like meter maids but for public health. Now you can get a ticket for parking and for not following the mask rules.
 Fuck sakes.....</p>
