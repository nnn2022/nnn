        <p>Nothing. I had some family/friends skip things we'd planned because they were experiencing symptoms of something and/or were exposed directly to COVID and I respected those choices (obviously we cancelled when they were sick - usually if someone <em>is around</em> someone else sick I don't care but as I've little kids the elders wanted to be more cautious due to COVID ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). </p>
<p>Personally I ain't cancelled shit. No masks, no temperature checks to come inside, sharing drinks and cake and hugs. I do not give a fuck.</p>
