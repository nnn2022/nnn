    <strong>Canadian Politics As Usual: Government Is Corrupt, Tries to Use WuFlu To Deflect Scrutiny!</strong>

<p>Cuck Justin Trudeau's government tries to use cries of "But muh pandemic!" to accuse Opposition parties of "partisanship" for daring to demand a committee investigate rampant Liberal corruption. Quelle Surprise!</p>
<p>I am starting to dream of a future where this globalist scumbag wakes up to the sound of tank tracks clanking in his driveway, and his door being booted in.</p>
<p>Cromwell was right: </p>
<p>&rt;<em>â€œIt is high time for me to put an end to your  sitting in this place, which you have dishonored by your contempt of all  virtue, and defiled by your practice of every vice; ye are a factious  crew, and enemies to all good government; ye are a pack of mercenary  wretches, and would like Esau sell your country for a mess of pottage,  and like Judas betray your God for a few pieces of money.</em><br>
<em>Is  there a single virtue now remaining amongst you? Is there one vice you  do not possess? Ye have no more religion than my horse; gold is your  God; which of you have not barter'd your conscience for bribes? Is there  a man amongst you that has the least care for the good of the  Commonwealth?</em><br>
<em>Ye sordid prostitutes have you not defil'd this  sacred place, and turn'd the Lord's temple into a den of thieves, by  your immoral principles and wicked practices? Ye are grown intolerably  odious to the whole nation; you were deputed here by the people to get  grievances redress'd, are yourselves gone! So! Take away that shining  bauble there, and lock up the doors.</em><br>
<em>In the name of God, go!"</em></p></p>
