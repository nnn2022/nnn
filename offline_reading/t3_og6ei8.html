    <strong>Leaving, relocating for freedom may not work. Hold your ground.</strong>
    <p><p>I came across many posts lately about moving to another country for freedom. Infact, I too did read the world-map more than I read newspapers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no free countries in the world now to go to. They have filled the whole world with their proxies, funded with their minted money, through global loan sharks like world-bank and IMF.</p>
<p>They can now coerce any of those countries we consider free to go full Nazi, by just threatening to pull the monetary plug. If not, they'll simply ask other proxies to start war, embargo, sanctions etc..</p>
<p>They have successfully couped us all. And world has become one giant cage.</p>
<p>All that is really left for us now is our will and our strong yearning for freedom, which they now try to prey upon constantly, through fear-mongering "news" from their so-called "leaders".</p>
<p>So, what can we do?!</p>
<p>Don't give in, never give up and hold your ground. What was rightfully yours, is not for the other to take.</p>
<p>Get and share your support among others whose will is focused against this tyranny and the heads of this snake. Work on your determination.</p>
<p>And last but not least, work on your health (Rule of thumb: Modern food, modern life and modern ways need modern medicines and modern cures).</p>
<p>If they cannot break our minds and dampen our spirits, whatever they do won't last much longer. The universe, it's entities and karma that favors us will come to our rescue. Time will tell, just as history has always been written. Stay strong.</p></p>

        <p>Easy to say if you're from a country that still has gun rights...unfortunately most of the rest of the world can barely buy a knife to chop vegetables with without a licence.</p>
<p>I'd give my left nut to move but at the minute I'm gearing up for deportation back to my home country once I refuse the jab. Even then who knows how that will go when my home country will probably expect me to get it to be even allowed back in.</p>
<p>By the end of the year we'll know how its going to play out. We basically have 6 months to get some semblance of humanity back or its over.</p>

        <p>I'm not from a country with gun-rights, or have I ever held a gun. Guns are not the only way to stand against tyranny, or at-least lets' not wait for that to happen. We can see many taking their stand in their own ways. Like say, by commenting on my post, you've already made your stand. Or to do something bigger like some org called ledbydonkeys, that puts thought-provoking banners to get the message out, works too. Personally, I'd say, will is more powerful than swords. Many out there who hate this tyranny as much as we do are too scared to speak up. Hope'd we could encourage them a bit. Stay strong and good luck. ✊</p>

        <p>I have a feeling there’s some places that will always be worse than others. Australia and Canada for example. I know there’s some countries where parts reopen completely and do just fine, but more and more, I just want to pare down my belongings and vanish into the woods and never be seen or heard of again tbh.</p>

        <p>Haha I was hoping so but you never can tell - I think a lot of people on this sub have realised nobody is coming to save us, but it's surprising how many can see through the government BS but fall straight into some other cult-like BS where we're promised a saviour just as long as we do absolutely nothing - it's getting infuriating.</p>

        <p>Amazing post and comments. The first battle we must have is against the Main Stream Media. Here in UK people believe in BBC more than their parents. Even those alterative channels that was started have been swallowed by the elite (YouTube, Twitter etc). You can boycott MSM but 99% of the people won't.</p>
<p>So saving the general public is out of the question.</p>
<p>Next thing to do is trawl through your countries law and find out your right. Right it down. Remember they constantly implement new laws to suit the elite. So keep on top of it. There will come a time some countries may mandate vax. At which point you can regurgitate to protect your grounds.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. We cannot let them create laws against our rights and then hope they'll "sunset" them later. Once we get somewhere out of this, we must audit all the edits that was made in the past sixty+ years. They've channeled us into their trap for decades now, through their left-right and conservative-liberal BS, while both sides seem to be working together as proxies in sync on the larger scale.</p>
