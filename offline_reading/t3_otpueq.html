    <strong>You don’t “trust” science. That’s not how science works.</strong>
    <p><p>This prideful slogan we hear constantly: “I trust the science”, (which, by the way, more accurately translates to; “I trust the television”),
is an oxymoron and the antithesis of what science is.  Science should never be a faith or trust-based system; science is not a God or a religion.  </p>
<p>Science is the act of being a skeptic; always a critical thinker in any given domain of knowledge you are presented. </p>
<p>So if common sense points to a contradiction in the claims of an “expert”, then that “expert”, if they are one; should have no problem clearing up
the proposed contradiction.  In fact they should be eager to do so as this is their job as a scientist. </p>
<p>But if their response instead is to tell you to shut up and “trust the science”, and to even go on to censor your question or presented information; then they are not a scientist, but a tyrant.  </p>
<p>And if they say this to you and you still choose to follow them, then you are not “following the science”, you are entering into a cult mentality.</p></p>

        <p>I had a conversation with a guy last weekend, he was wondering why I wasn’t vaxxed yet (not that it’s any of his business). It got pretty heated and I gave him all kinds of valid points which sort of stumped him. In the end he said “you just have to take a leap of faith and get the vaccine.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe it and walked away after that.</p>

        <p>Nah, I suspect it's about 50-50. Leftists are more influenced by the media. I am not even saying they are dumb or anything, but mass media is just leftist propaganda at this point. They are also more on the internet. The right doesn't have many if any paid shills on twitter. Grifters sure but random accounts pushing right wing ideology like bots are non existent.</p>
<p>The messaging you see online is not the actual concensus of the people. There is loads of us.</p>
<p>I just bought a house and the sellers were non vaccinated except for one of them out of 5. And he was around 60 so I would have taken it as well if I was him. Like what, it will kill me in the future? Infertility? He is a government worker so it's just easier.</p>
<p>My peers took it though. Many of them. So I can't claim that nobody is really taking it either.</p>

        <p>I mean... That's exactly what happened here. You're right that science should always ask questions, but the point isn't just to question things... It's to question things in the relentless pursuit of truth. Scientists find things that seem true by subjecting them to every test imaginable </p>
<p>With the vaccines, they've been tested repeatedly by a tremendously diverse collection of people across many different institutions, countries, etc. And they've now been given out some 3 or 4 billion times.</p>
<p>The reason people make fun of you is because you're apparently unable to consider the irony that your own biases are preventing you from seeing an obvious truth. You're the rough equivalent of a flat earther... There's tremendous and well tested evidence that the world is round... So yeah, I trust the science there too.</p>

        <p>BatSoup, I think your engaged with a shill.</p>
<p>None of the accusations he(?) made of me are accurate. And he was downvoted for it. No need to defend myself. My post stands.</p>
<p>But I do want to address an attempt to shift focus Hillier Clinton style. (What? Pour bleach on my computer bits? Of course not)</p>
<p>mRNA vaxs messenger RNA not DNA. To my knowledge no one is saying it modifies DNA. (although until tested..) RNA is in the outside part of cells. The largest single cell on the planet is the ostrich egg.. The yellow part is where DNA is. The white part of the egg is where RNA is. Its also where the organelles are. Means tiny organs. That is where the cell does its function.</p>
<p>Its unclear how much "messaging" and how much "modifying" is done. What is clear is NO MRNA HAS EVER BEEN APPROVED FOR USE ON HUMANS. This is gene therapy  rolled out with the intent to infect every man, woman, and child on the planet. </p>
<p>We can trust that science.</p>

        <p>The FDA did approve use of multiple mRNA vaccines though, so you can’t say that mRNA hasn’t been approved for use in humans because it has been on an emergency basis. We can debate the merits of that being a good decision, but it definitely happened.</p>

Just because the person isn’t a commercial pilot doesn’t mean the procedure is somehow less safe. In this case, the company that makes the drug still has to submit their data for independent approval, even with the emergency authorization. Further,At least one of the drugs (Moderna’s)drug is undergoing normal scrutiny in addition to the emergency authorization. They have applied for full approval, and they’re working on it now. The application hasn’t been rejected yet as unsafe or not based on evidence. Sure the long, in the long term we might find out it has problems. However, Covid itself also appears to have some pretty severe long term respiratory effects too that aren’t death.</p>

        <p>You gotta be kidding. </p>
<p>You are not a commercial pilot in the above scenario. YES the situation is less safe with a non commercial pilot in the captains chair. Auto driving cars are not safe unattended but you suggest an auto landing jumbo jet is?</p>
<p>mRNA drugs have NEVER been FDA approved for human use. EVER.</p>
<p>Make up any justification you want. These facts are not changing. They have worked on mRNAs for over a decade. This is not a time constraint problem.</p>

        <p>Go ask a pilot, the 747-800 basically flies itself.(https://www.flightdeckfriend.com/ask-a-pilot/can-a-plane-land-automatically)</p>
<p>The argument isn’t whether they haven’t been approved in the past. They were approved as I said, you just don’t feel comfortable with the process. That’s fine. However, the time it takes to navigate federal bureaucracy doesn’t automatically make the drug safer. </p>
<p>mRNA technology isn’t new. It is decently well understood(https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243). Anything that makes you think we don’t know how it works is some doomer-level BS. Human trials were underway well before COVID was on anyone’s radar. They have to get approval to run human clinical trials from Institutional Review Boards. They’re not just firing from the hip, human trials come extremely late in the process. By the time a drug even makes it to the point of being submitted for approval, the company has already established the drug is safe and will meet FDA requirements. Companies aren’t going to spend the money on an application that has a good chance of being denied. </p>
<p>Moderna claims they designed their vaccine in 2 days (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/moderna-designed-coronavirus-vaccine-in-2-days-2020-11%3famp) That wasn’t because they rushed it, it’s because it wasn’t a hard problem to solve. It is true that we don’t know how things will go long term. That’s a fair criticism, there simply hasn’t been enough time to see. What isn’t is the idea that just because it has never been done automatically means the process is unsafe.</p>

<p>You are not a commercial pilot just because you emergency landed a plane.</p>
<p>mRNA drugs have never been FDA approved. Period.</p>
<p>I don't care if its being used under emergency orders. Its still not FDA approved. Like you said they have worked on mRNAs for a long time. NONE OF THEM ARE FDA APPROVED.</p>
<p>Moderna had NEVER brought a drug to market with FDA approval. There name is Mod RNA.</p>
<p>Bypassing FDA approval is by definition unsafe. They are our "safeguards".</p>

        <p>I think you are right, the projection, logical fallacies and ad hominems are very shill-like, not to mention the misleading information. Sometimes I hold out hope it's just someone not educated enough, but ah well.</p>
<p>I also enjoy how the medical community is so silent on the very real chance of reverse transcriptase with these EUA mRNA gene therapies. What other genes are sliding past the filters and going into our bodies? Time will tell but it's pretty clear by now this vaccine push is not in the interest of general health.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the source.</p>
<p>I took a look through and it doesn't appear there has actually been any clinical studies finished on pregnant women yet at this time. There are some recommendations made off some real-world data observations and assumptions. Many of the recorded tests were from third trimester pregnancies, but still not much data overall and none on observing the baby after birth.</p>
<p>I would argue that the evidence the vaccine is "safe for unborn babies" is incomplete and therefore disingenuous to declare the vaccine safe for pregnancy.</p>

        <p>Well note too that the reason all these pregnancy related medical groups have started coming out with their pro-vaccine recommendations is not just that there's decent evidence now that the vaccines don't cause harm, but also that the absence of them does.</p>
<p>They're seeing that pregnant women who don't get the vaccine, and are therefore at a higher risk of getting covid, end up disproportionately having covid-related harms befall their pregnancies. </p>
<p>Obviously everything with pregnancy falls in the "talk to your doctor" bucket and scientists are far more careful with things like this with pregnant women, but findings like these are really good to see.</p>
<p>In any case the hope is that enough people who are not in these edge cases get the vaccine so that we can build herd immunity and help protect people who can't get them for medical reasons. Unfortunately many people just seem scared or don't care or don't understand the risks and so that's not working.</p>

<p>I noticed this in the "expert recommendations" and this is some of the most absurd anti-science conjecture I've ever heard, par for the course on this pandemic. "The absence of evidence can not be used as evidence for absence." This is a known logical fallacy, and I'm going to assume the use of this indicates a marketing ploy rather than a scientific observation.</p>

        <p>What the other poster is saying is that there are studies that seem to indicate getting Covid isn’t great for baby and mom based the 100 or so deaths and ~17,000 hospital admissions. This isn’t an appeal to experts fallacy, it’s saying that the people who are experts who ran the study are making a recommendation based on their interpretation of the data. You are free to visit the CDC website and do your own review of the data to see if you come to the same conclusion the experts did. That’s exactly what the peer review process is. The problem is most people don’t have the skills to sort through the raw data, nor do they have the knowledge on how to conduct a study that produces good results that we can use to make recommendations. People are so willing to trust the experts (the actual logical fallacy) because they trust that the experts actually know what they’re talking about. The thing is, modern knowledge is so vast that usually the only people who know enough to challenge the experts in a valid way are other experts. That’s why these online debates are so full of fallacies; neither side has the ability to produce original research in the subject.</p>

        <p>Oh sure, I understand where they are coming from, but it is still an illogical way of arguing a case of safety where the evidence is the lack of evidence. You can believe covid is the worst thing ever but to reach that conclusion you'd need to ignore the problematic comorbidites, faulty PCR tests, lockdown stressors on pregnancy, etc. There's too much to be able to sit there and confidently say "you'd be way better off with this injection than without." The whole post reeks of a narrative anyway. Vaccines are like a god to these zealots.</p>

        <p>See my post about your meteor example. Yeah there are a lot of questions, but you can also start with the initial premise that a bunch of people are dying from a disease, for example about 600,000 more in the US than usual in a given year. From that perspective it’s a matter of public health to try to do something to keep that number from growing larger. Those people obviously had bad outcomes, what did they all have in common and how can we design an intervention both need to be investigated, but that is going to take time. People want to know what they can do right now before we know about these things, so what educated guesses can we make based on things like this that have happened in the past.</p>

        <p>That cuts right to the heart of the issue. I do not believe 600k healthy people died from a coronavirus. I believe the PCR tests are faulty, the inventor said they cannot be used to diagnose since they WILL find anything in anyone at enough cycles. The mortality rate is more or less the same as it has been every year, the excess deaths can easily be explained by harsh lockdown measures, spikes in depression and overdoses, suicides, and sick people being placed in nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. Therefore, any study that uses this magical 600k figure as the basis of their study is now suspect. When you remove this magical 600k assumption, and no there are not 600k vials of isolated samples taken from autopsies, there really isn't much evidence indicating there is a pandemic of healthy people dying from a coronavirus.</p>

        <p>I think this and your other reply are the most well reasoned things I have seen on this subreddit. I hope the people here read this conversation and really understand why I am saying that it’s a well reasoned, legitimate argument. A lot of the crap here is just that, crap, but this is a specific, measurable actionable line of reasoning that can and probably should be used to drive public policy decisions. Oh well, we can dream, right?</p>
<p>I think you are right, the heart of the issue is how do we measure the relevant statistic, people who died of Covid. I think I’m willing to accept some number of deaths are miscounted based on faulty testing. I think the thing that I can’t seem to agree with is that there were not a larger number of people who died last year than a given year. It’s hard to mess that up outside of arithmetic errors and bad reporting; you are either dead or you aren’t.  At this point the data that I consider probably valid shows a 17.7% increase in mortality from the prior year (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778234) If you are willing to accept that data valid, which I am inclined to do because it comes from a national reporting system that has multiple inputs and isn’t easy to front-load with fraudulent data,  then there has to be some reason more people died. Again, this still doesn’t mean Covid. </p>
<p>The data comes from death certificate data, meaning the initial data is highly subjective; it is up to the pronouncing doctor or coroner to determine cause of death. I admit that this easily could be over reported. It isn’t an objective thing. People have raised the issue numerous times that doctors are just writing COVID-19 without any connection to what really happened. So this is the first point where I personally think that there could be another cause of death. However, the assumption here is that people who are trained to determine cause of death are collectively reporting it wrong. I don’t believe they have any motive to do so on a mass scale, hospital doctors aren’t paid by the pronouncement so there is no financial incentive to lie. The insurance payments happen well after the person dies, I know this from personal experience, as my mother works in hospital billing. Take that how you will. Ignoring fraud, so if they are wrong it is because they were lazy with their pronouncement or they were wrong. Maybe they were subconsciously by influenced by the news reports and led astray by false positives from bad PCR tests to miss-pronounce. However, death certificates also include additional information. I don’t have the data, but I am willing to presume that the people who died had a similar halo of symptoms: difficulty breathing due to some kind of respiratory disorder that required intubation before death. This is a big assumption that definitely requires independent investigation. If you’ll allow me the convenience of that assumption, we now have a large number of people who have died under similar circumstances, more than the year before.</p>
<p>If you look at the data, the deaths came in 3 distinct waves. The source also notes that in 2020, other causes of death increase last year as well leading the authors to consider the number of Covid deaths to actually be underreported. That point is especially important; the data already shows an increase in other causes of death. If Covid is not at play then something is causing about half a million sick people to die who wouldn’t have died in an ordinary year. However, the reporting in waves is consistent with what we have experienced with viral and bacterial infections in the past. So while it is an assumption, we can now make an educated guess that the halo of symptoms is being caused by some kind of viral or bacterial agent. </p>
<p>At this point I am personally comfortable with the official story that a novel coronavirus, a cousin of the flu, probably killed these people. I can make all of those deductions just based on one set of data.  Correct me if you think my logic doesn’t follow at any point.</p>
<p>The alternative explanation tequires me to believe that more people didn’t die. That requires either a mass coverup (next to impossible), a large number of doctors around the globe who have little reason to fabricate data (in my opinion) to have lied or have been wrong, and (and this is personally the smoking gun for me) that there weren’t actual bodies and no actual dead people. This is where I have to rely on personal experience, which I understand is not a great basis for an argument, but I still feel reasonably comfortable using. My wife is a hospitalist. She saw the bodies. At least in our hospital, more people were dying than normal. Maybe my wife is lying. Maybe we were an outlier. However, I personally find these assumptions to be valid. Occam’s razor says that the hypothesis with the least amount of assumptions tends to be the most correct. From where I’m sitting, I’m pretty convinced by the official story because it doesn’t require me to assign nefarious motives to people who would otherwise have no reason to deceive me, someone they don’t know even exists. It also doesn’t require me to believe that the bulk of medical professionals, with whom I have trusted for numerous other medical issues and have been correct, were simply wrong.</p>
<p>At any rate, that’s the basis for my belief that holding the rock was a reasonable course of action. Obviously there are more steps between a respiratory disorder killed a lot of people and the vaccine is a good idea. However, my reasoning is going to follow the same lines of logic and make the same assumptions. Maybe you have good reason to doubt my assumptions, and that’s fair. But most of the people in this subreddit can’t tell me why I should doubt the line of reasoning listed above. </p>
<p>People need to critically evaluate how they came to believe that they should resist the new normal. Unfortunately most of the people here haven’t done that. They have at best drawn a conclusion from a string of inconsistencies without determining how they know those inconsistencies to be correct. And that, honestly, is more terrifying to me than the new normal ever could ever be.</p>

        <p>I certainly appreciate the well thought out replies, it can be hard to come across these sort of conversations so readily online anymore so this at the very least presents some good opportunities to share notes!</p>
<p>I'll try to address your points in turn. It is critical to understand each other's perspectives in trying to find common ground especially when the answers can be so damning and I appreciate the chance to rebut. I agree part of the core issue with this pandemic has been the parading of the fabled 600k dead, without this stat (and the other equivalents obviously) the whole house of card crumbles. And the resulting counter narrative is dark enough to strongly consider, in my opinion, however unpleasant.</p>
<p>To your first point, the article you link to "The Leading Causes Of Death" - covid deaths are mentioned as the third leading cause for 2020. Funny enough I have a similar article, this one from Johns Hopkins from some years prior, whom I view to be a reliable source on par with others on JAMA, https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/study_suggests_medical_errors_now_third_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us, published in the BMJ. You can see the glaring discrepancies between the two conclusions these studies offer! And yet they are both vying for the same spot! Anyway, so if JH reasons there are deaths being misclassified in our professional healthcare setting in such a high number, it goes without saying the same consideration should be applied when questioning any sources of stats emerging from the industry, the latest of which has resulted in the formation of an overall pretty lackluster pandemic.</p>
<p>In your link, the chart shows in 2020 deaths from Covid are 365,000. I'm not sure how this becomes 600k (is that counting this year too?) but for arguments sake let's just say even 350k is too many anyway, and the overall rate appears to have increased by 17% like you said. So let's get into what the deaths could be, if not covid, then what? </p>
<p>As an aside, I agree that the main reason the deaths could be misattributed to a novel virus is not because of greedy evil doctors, rather it is the simple fault of a broken and incorrect recording system. "Never attribute to malice that which can be explained by ignorance". It is a terrifying suggestion that our healthcare system could be so flawed, however it is one we must observe. Keep in mind the "increased yearly death rate" stat was hardly more than a projection as this was unfolding, so this is just as much a critique of the decisions and measures made in response to the pandemic. HOWEVER, after much consideration I do believe there is some underlying ulterior motives, in a particularly evil flavor, but I digress for now.</p>
<p>So what could account for the excess deaths? From my observations, it can be broken down thusly: </p>
<ol>
<li>Although not attributing directly to the count, it should be noted first and foremost, in regards to faulty PCR testing being used to diagnose covid deaths</li>
<li>
<p>(a) PCR testing should not be utilized to diagnose ANY disease, the late inventor Kary Mullis is on video record stating this, claiming it finds any microbe in anyone, and he in fact was a large outspoken opponent of Fauci's for years due to Fauci's of PCR to diagnose AIDS in the 80s. Mullis passed away shortly before the pandemic. </p>
<ul>
<li>(b) Many places recorded covid deaths as "any death within 28 days of a positive PCR test" which is an absolutely garbage statistic to use and an abomination of scientific integrity, for what should be obvious reasons</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early pandemic responses: the best idea floated as an early response was the use of ventilators. Ventilators were later discovered to have themselves a death rate of up to 88% in places, due to the trauma induced from the invasive procedure (https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200422/most-covid-19-patients-placed-on-ventilators-died-new-york-study-shows)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nursing Home Deaths: Several states moved tens of thousands of sick patients into nursing homes, this could attribute for MANY of the initial pandemic deaths, at least 184,000 according to NYTimes (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html) I'm actually not a fan of the idea that asymptomatic spread is a primary driver of disease (due to it being proven so rare), however even if sick people couldn't actually spread disease, the power of suggestion and placebo is very strong, especially in stressed older people with naturally lower immune function</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary Lockdown effects: suicide, domestic violence, overdoses. While mass suicide rate increases are still debated, suicide spikes were particularly high in the black community, as well as suicide attempts in teens (many of which may have ended up with lowered immune systems and then succumbing to covid, thus becoming another stat), and domestic violence was also a prominent issue, especially regarding small children, sadly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monetary incentive: As an additional note, contrary to your position, I believe there was plenty of monetary incentive to mark deaths as a covid stat, as well as continuing the pandemic fear response</p>
</li>
<li>(a) Under the CARES act, hospitals can add 20% to their fee for treating a covid patient on Medicare, and according to Kaiser, the average Medicare payment for a covid patient is around $13,000. If a patient is on a ventilator for at least 4 days, Medicare may pay out at least $40,000. Now to your other point, there may not be a large amount of doctors taking up this offer, but hospitals are for profit businesses and there are definitely some people who would gladly take this offer</li>
<li>(b) The vaccine industry itself is a multi-billion dollar enterprise. Pfizer said they expect to generate $26b in revenue this year (up from previous estimated $15b), and is negotiating government contracts around the world as far out as 2024 (this will be going on a while), and Bill Gates is even on record bragging about his 20-to-1 return on vaccine investment of $10b, so he is expecting at least $200b ROI alone. If that's not monetary incentive, idk what is!</li>
</ol>
<p>So if all this wasn't enough to disillusion you, the rabbit hole goes much deeper for those who have the heart and mind, but in the interest of not having this thread removed for "misinformation" I can save that for another time. Let's just say not everyone agrees that coronaviruses are actually the cause of disease, and many argue that they may actually be a part of the apoptosis (cell death) cycle. Very large implications, but keep it mind "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the companies responsible for these vaccines are themselves proven criminal enterprises. Pfizer settled in 2009 for 2.3b worth of fraud and bribary, J&amp;J are currently settling their asbestos-in-baby-powder case, I think they've talked down to around 3b from 7b+. Not to mention these very same criminal companies have been granted full liability immunity, so they cannot be held responsible for their products in the future.</p>
<p>All of this considered, I have a hard time accepting there is indeed, unequivocally, a pandemic of healthy people succumbing to a novel coronavirus. The counter narrative is one of a corrupted healthcare institution, based in bad science, being fronted by powerful money men, currently leading us into a dystopian medical-industrial tyranny, a 2-tiered caste based system where only those who subject themselves to scheduled third party chemical injections are afforded the luxury that our life and liberty currently gives us. We are seeing the effects of these tyrannical decisions all around the world in the form of mass protests against vaccination descrimination and vax passports, and as a principle, JUST IN CASE we are wrong about "covid" being dangerous, and it is indeed a slippery slope to medical apartheid, my own conscience tells me I cannot join such an endevour, and it is my right and indeed my duty to reject and oppose such a narrative.</p>

        <p>You misunderstood... The absence of them increases the likelihood of getting covid and covid causes harm. The absence of seatbelts increases the likelihood of dying in a car accident... It's not a logical fallacy, you just don't like what it means - big difference.</p>

        <p>No, you misunderstand the fallacy.</p>
<p>I have a rock, I claim my rock protects against meteor strikes. Meteor strikes are really bad. People who have been hit by meteor strikes have not had my rock, therefore the rock is effective in protecting against meteor strikes, and it is more dangerous to not have my rock.</p>
<p>Starting to make sense?</p>

        <p>The obvious way to test your rock is to hold it and get hit by a meteor. Obviously meteor strikes are rare, and it isn’t really ethical to hit people with meteors. An analogy to the Covid vaccine is that we do however know that people who volunteered to hold the rock have had less physical damage when they got hit by a certain type of meteor under extremely controlled conditions. We also know that in the past people who have constructed meteor strike bunkers made from rocks took a whole lot less damage than people standing out in the open. Can we say with absolute certainty that the rock will protect you? No, but since there are a lot of meteors falling down right now, we as meteor scientists recommend that people hold a rock because people who hold rocks seem to have better outcomes. That’s basically what we know about Covid right now. There are a lot of places where assumptions are being made (maybe there really aren’t a lot of meteor strikes right now, maybe being hit by a meteor isn’t so bad if you are of a certain age group, maybe holding onto a rock for a long time will actually damage you worse than a meteor strike, etc), but we don’t have the luxury of fully testing these assumptions because people are being hit by meteors and they are demanding that policy makers do something about it.</p>

        <p>That is a good continuation of that example, you make some great points and I do believe that is what the other poster was trying to get at. However, in continuing on in the same example, the rocks might be considered a good idea to carry based off that initial review. The difference, is that people are being told they NEED to carry the rock with them, at all times, they need to carry a rock and wear a helmet, and they can never ever put the rock down. The rock is different sizes and affects everyone differently, sometimes it comes in the size of a boulder and absolutely crushes the holder, but they are being told you MUST hold your rock, and you will be fired from your job if you don't, you will be outcast from society if you dont, can't take popular modes of transit if you don't. And some people are still debating if there is even a real chance of being hit with a meteor. </p>
<p>I think after all of it is said and done, there is not much real reason to carry such a rock, especially when you can look outside and see indeed, there is no meteor shower, and instead some very vocal people live next to a golf course.</p>

        <p>Nope... unfortunately, you're not. </p>
<p>I think the piece you're missing is the logic of causality. You're providing an example of the basic notion that "correlation is not causation." And yes, causation is hard. It usually requires a theoretical reason why A -&rt; B, some ability to demonstrate temporal precedence of A, and solid empirical evidence that the effect B is observed in a predictable way following A.</p>
<p>So... your rock/meteor case... none of those things hold up. But - covid vaccine! There, we have reason to believe it should work - it's designed to do exactly that following many years of work in all kinds of related disciplines as well as a lot of specific work on virology, mRNA generally, and vaccines created using them. Next, we can (and have, repeatedly) seen controlled experiments where we can observe the effect of using these vaccines on the likelihood of a person getting covid and how damaging a covid infection becomes.</p>
<p>In short... what you seem to be missing is that [covid vaccine] is causally related to [not getting covid]. And, when we can show that, then we get to think about secondary effects. In this case, we can think about how covid is causally related to negative pregnancy outcomes. It seems that it is, unfortunately (thanks to other causal studies). So... we get to say that [covid vaccine] -&rt; [less likely to get covid/serious covid] -&rt; [less likely to have a negative pregnancy outcome due to covid].</p>
<p>Again, a better analog than your rock thing is just seatbelts, because they're causally demonstrable.... So... [wearing a seatbelt] -&rt; [less likely to have your body fly through a car during an accident] -&rt; [less likely to die from having your body smash through a windshield].</p>

        <p>I appreciate your response!</p>
<p>The argument that the absence of vaccines could ever be proof of the potential damage caused without them is indeed a logical fallacy, and no amount of correlation/causation will make this argument any less fallacious at its core. The argument is really indeed one for vaccines, and will always view the vaccination as the ONLY cure to whatever problem has been set, while the counter argument is that a pregnant woman does not inherently need a vaccine and does not need to bear the risks of the new technology, when other methods are available to negate any would-be covid harms. Not to mention raw chances of catching covid vs. chance of effects of the injection on unborn baby, one is almost impossible to define while the other is almost 100% certain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while this is all good hypothetically, in reality, the buck stops at "vaccines prevent covid". We know unequivocally that vaccines DO NOT prevent the user from catching the virus, they may prevent symptoms at best, but this is important because many things also help to prevent symptoms and claiming vaccines are the only way is simply not true.</p>
<p>Therefore the absence of a vaccine cannot be linked to "causing more harm" than having it. It is disingenuous to declare pregnant women to be more at risk of general harm without a specialized product than with, all things considered, and I believe the evidence stands in my favor on this matter, regardless of what the industry mouthpieces are pushing.</p>

        <p>Wow - lots of goofy stuff in here... and I do need to move on with my life. But I am sorry you feel this way. </p>
<p>OK though - again - you're definitely wrong on the fallacy thing. This is easier to see by structuring it as a simply binary choice. In path A, you have probably X of getting covid; in path B, you have probability Y. You're right that proving why any given person didn't get covid is impossible. But we can demonstrate that the probability of getting covid is lower in one of those paths. And that has been demonstrated, repeatedly, across many different studies and places. The fact that you get to choose the path doesn't change the process happening within them.</p>
<p>As for the rest of your statements, it's clear that the key sentence is your last one - this is just a kind of religious belief of yours. You're welcome to hold such a belief, but that's really all it is. Yes, they definitely help prevent you from getting covid. This isn't just "industry mouthpieces" doing research and telling you to buy their product. The covid vaccines have and are actively being studied by such a diverse set of players that it's mind blowing. Governments across the world (many of whom hate one another); universities and professors with no stake in any financial outcome; nonprofit and intergovernmental organizations; random individual experts who just studied the data... so, so, many people have looked at this stuff and come to the same conclusions. Those conclusions boil down to: you're wrong, get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>It is increasingly clear you are not very educated on this subject but I appreciate your time in responding.</p>
<p>Vaccines do not prevent you from catching covid. </p>
<p>Arguing that a vaccine is necessary rather than aiming to not be obese or have many of the other actual factually damaging diseases is simping for the pharmacy industry and not the general health of the population.</p>
<p>I asked for evidence and you gave me a single opinion article that demonstrated the trials on pregnant women are incomplete. And yes, they are industry mouthpieces that are recommending the vaccine, the same ones that also recommend the HPV vaccine to newborns. It is okay to disagree with hypothetically argued conclusions that are clearly incentivised by profit and narrative rather than hard science.</p>
<p>Your ad hominems show you are not arguing in good faith. I'm done here as well. Good day!</p>

        <p>The vaccines do not alter your DNA. That is just a lie/misunderstanding about what mRNA is and how these work. They don't even enter the cell's nucleus:</p>

        <p>Hey right back at you!</p>
<p>But so now that you see they definitely don't alter your DNA, I hope you can get past your fears and just get the shot. For whatever it's worth, mine were both fine. I got a little sleepy after the second but just watched some TV that afternoon and was fine by the evening.</p>

The rhetoric coming from the mainstream media is making them out to be some sort of priest class. Really strange cyberpunk dystopia vibes I’m getting these days.</p>

        <p>It's not just that sometimes scientists get it wrong sometimes and it's then corrected. It's that being a scientist doesn't neccessarily mean you are a morally good person like at all, this is from experience. Scientists can even get very obsessive about their own work and want it to succeed even when the cost of that might be too high.</p>

        <p>I honestly never encountered people who scream "it's science" unless we are talking about highly politicised issues like climate change or in this case COVID 19.  The person who is actually informed will use specific terminology while referring to a certain topic. For example , an informed person will say " the bio medical engineers and virologists use hazmat suit to not to get contaminated" as opposed to covidians who will say " science says put on the mask". It's akin to behaviour of Jesse Pinkman in BB when he says "yeah science bitch". It's lazy and those guys cannot even put a minimum effort in using specific terminology. I have observed these behaviour with lots of atheists as well who also uses the term " I believe in science ". You actually don't believe in science, you evaluate it constantly for different scenarios that are arising and confirm the proposed methodology's position. The latest abomination is "settled science" while discussing these politicised issues.</p>

        <p>Thank you! I hate “trust science” and “believe in science”. By its very nature, science is not something to “trust” or “believe”. Science is meant to be fluid and ever changing. It’s something to observe and draw conclusions from but not something to trust and believe in. Some of the worlds greatest scientists have been proven faulty in their conclusions. 
Scientifically, it’s nearly impossible to prove causation because variable xyz might come along and throw off the results. </p>
<p>I’m not saying that science isn’t important or useful. Of course it is. Without it, advancing as a society wouldn’t have been possible. Plus, it’s fun to experiment! But I feel people forget there are no hard conclusions. It all comes down to benefits versus risks, probability etc. There is no emotional response involved such as “trusting and believing”. It worries me that we are given a set of data and told not to question it. That isn’t science.</p>
<p>Demanding the population blindly accept “science” and forgo critical thinking is baffling. I feel we are living in the upside down.</p>

        <p>Science is also never settled, as it inherently ongoing process. Each new discovery is just another input into a perpetual study. So trusting 'science' is ridiculous, as you say, because most of it is pretty muddy from the many different inputs.</p>

        <p>Scientism is a religion for stupid people. The corporations with the most money pay for engineered studies which are the scriptures of the dogmatic religion of Scientism. There's real science, then there's what majority of people in the world call science, based on their scriptures / studies. Its a mind-control agenda and its working on everyone except for those of us with two functioning brain cells and a shred of conscience left.</p>

        <p>I think the point is you are placing your trust in observation and deductive reasoning. David Hume and a lot of other philosophers famously wrote about the reliability of the senses vs creations of the mind. Now, our understanding of the universe is a lot more advanced now and we have a fairly good understanding of our sense faculties and how they really work. However, the scientific method is still based on the belief that we can in fact trust that what we observe is as the universe really is. We know a lot of people who have hallucinations due to medical disorders who see and hear things that aren’t real, after all. And there are recorded cases of mass hallucinations, which could always happen during scientific observation. The key is reproducibility over time; if you are hallucinating the same thing every time you try something, maybe you aren’t hallucinating.</p>
<p>The scientific method is still based on a foundation of garbage in, garbage out. You have to make sure you a really observing what you think you are. Hence, you trust that the data collection method is giving you good data so that your scientific deductive reasoning is giving you a good conclusion.  </p>
<p>As is often said, science doesn’t prove anything. All it does is eliminate reasoning that is observationally incorrect, until such a time that we have ruled out enough hypotheses so that we can reproduce the results with a great degree of certainty.</p>
<p>Ironically, a lot of the “evidence” here that things aren’t as they seem are actually the scientific process working as intended. It’s like with masks, we believe they work. Papers come out that say they don’t seem to work, so we revise our belief that they work. There’s no consistent story when we are still learning about a physical phenomenon. A lot of people on this subreddit take the inconsistency as something sinister when the reality is, we just don’t know.</p>
<p>There is the issue of junk science as I alluded to above with my garbage in garbage out thing above. The problem is most people here don’t seem to trust peer reviewed studies that support the mainstream hypothesis because of conflicts of interest, “bought and paid for” researchers, and editors that suppress otherwise good studies that go against the mainstream story. As someone who regularly reads JAMA and the Lancet, I personally I think the effects and occurrences of these junk sciences are vastly overblown here, because I believe most researchers are sincere and doing real work, but at the end of the day that’s why I had no problem getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>For me trust the science means I trust that short term studies, which seem to show the vaccine is effective with limited side effects, are good science and much more critically, that the short term effects continue to be true over the long term. We don’t know what these things do in the long term because we simply haven’t had enough time to observe the people who take the vaccines. However, the same is true about the long term effects of the Covid virus itself. And the short term effects of Covid don’t appear to be something I want to deal with, so I’ll take my gamble and trust the science behind the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Guys and gals..</p>
<p>Here's a crazy theory.</p>
<p>The Capitalists and the Neo-cons have decided that enough is enough when it comes to the Leftards and the Wokesters.
So they got Trump as a guy to irritate and in general make the Left very emotional and hysterical. That was phase 1 (Trump presidency).</p>
<p>Phase 2 is the extermination of the Leftists by vaxx. Because the Wokesters were made to be in a very irrational state of mind and feeling during Trump presidency, they were in fact primed and perfect targets for the fear pron during 2020.</p>
<p>What if the objective is not just the destruction of the Leftists biologically, but in general of the weak beta soyboys and soygirls and soy-its, and the total decredibilization of all Leftist ideology?
The best way to achieve that is to actually let the World see how evil and toxic Leftism can be. And you facilitate that by simply giving the Leftist enough power to actually destroy themselves.</p>
