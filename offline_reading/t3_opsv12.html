    <strong>Divide et Impera</strong>
    <p><p>Recently, another user posted a video link about an aggression study in rats using electric discharges through the floor of their cages.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Many of you have are also members of the subreddit r/conspiracy - if I had to venture a wild guess.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>for those of you who took the red pill a long, long time ago then what I'm about to say is nothing new, but a great reminder</p>
<p>and for those of you are newly awoken, welcome to community! We're a strange bunch of critical thinkers, just like yourself. We have lives just like you, families just like you, jobs and careers - just like you. I'm proud to say I'm a conspiracy theorist. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists' are just critical thinkers. We dont merely accept what we're told because we base our conclusions off of our own observations.</p>
<p>Conspiracy Theorists tend to be higher IQ on a standard bell curve in whats considered WEIRD culture. WEIRD stands for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Oftentimes, highly educated and/or highly intelligent people internally agree or are empathetic towards certain conspiracy theories, not all of them but being intelligent or educated means they have some sort of critical thinking skills and open-mindedness.</p>
<p>However, they fall prey to logical fallacies, as do we all from time to time. Such fallacies include:</p>
<p>- </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Availability Bias</strong> (also, Attention Bias, Anchoring Bias): A fallacy of logos stemming from the natural tendency to give undue attention and importance to information that is immediately available at hand, particularly the first or last information received, and to minimize or ignore broader data or wider evidence that clearly exists but is not as easily remembered or accessed. E.g., "We know from experience that this doesn't work," when "experience" means the most recent local attempt, ignoring overwhelming experience from other places and times where it <em>ha</em>s worked and <em>does</em> work. Also related is the fallacy of <strong>Hyperbole</strong> [also, Magnification, or sometimes Catastrophizing] where an immediate instance is immediately proclaimed "the most significant in all of human history," or the "worst in the whole world!" This latter fallacy works extremely well with less-educated audiences and those whose "whole world" is very small indeed, audiences who "hate history" and whose historical memory spans several weeks at best.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Bandwagon Fallacy</strong> (also, Argument from Common Sense, Argumentum ad Populum): The fallacy of arguing that because "everyone," "the people," or "the majority" (or someone in power who has widespread backing) supposedly thinks or does something, it must therefore be true and right. E.g., "Whether there actually is large scale voter fraud in America or not, many people now think there is and that makes it so." Sometimes also includes <strong>Lying with Statistics</strong>, e.g. “Over 75% of Americans believe that crooked Bob Hodiak is a thief, a liar and a pervert. There may not be any evidence, but for anyone with half a brain that conclusively proves that Crooked Bob should go to jail! Lock him up! Lock him up!” This is sometimes combined with the "Argumentum ad Baculum," e.g., "Like it or not, it's time to choose sides: Are you going to get on board  the bandwagon with everyone else, or get crushed under the wheels as it goes by?" Or in the 2017 words of former White House spokesperson Sean Spicer, ""They should either get with the program or they can go," A contemporary digital form of the Bandwagon Fallacy is the <strong>Information Cascade, "</strong>in which people echo the opinions of others, usually online, even when their own opinions or exposure to information contradicts that opinion. When information cascades form a pattern, this pattern can begin to overpower later opinions by making it seem as if a consensus already exists." See also Wisdom of the Crowd, and The Big Lie Technique. For the opposite of this fallacy see the Romantic Rebel fallacy. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>The Big Lie Technique</strong> (also the Bold Faced Lie; "Staying on Message."): The contemporary fallacy of repeating a lie, fallacy, slogan, talking-point, nonsense-statement or deceptive half-truth over and over in different forms (particularly in the media) until it becomes part of daily discourse and people accept it without further proof or evidence. Sometimes the bolder and more outlandish the Big Lie becomes the more credible it seems to a willing, most often angry audience. E.g., "What about the Jewish Problem?" Note that when this particular phony debate was going on there was no "Jewish Problem," only a Nazi Problem, but hardly anybody in power recognized or wanted to talk about that, while far too many ordinary Germans were only too ready to find a convenient scapegoat to blame for their suffering during the Great Depression. Writer Miles J. Brewer expertly demolishes The Big Lie Technique in his classic (1930) short story, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Avon_Fantasy_Reader/Issue_10/The_Gostak_and_the_Doshes">"The Gostak and the Doshes."</a> However, more contemporary examples of the Big Lie fallacy might be the completely fictitious August 4, 1964 "Tonkin Gulf Incident" concocted under Lyndon Johnson as a false justification for escalating the Vietnam War, or the non-existent "Weapons of Mass Destruction" in Iraq (conveniently abbreviated "WMD's" in order to lend this Big Lie a legitimizing, military-sounding "Alphabet Soup" ethos), used in 2003 as a false justification for the Second Gulf War. The November, 2016 U.S. President-elect's statement that "millions" of ineligible votes were cast in that year's American. presidential election appears to be a classic Big Lie. See also, Alternative Truth; The Bandwagon Fallacy, the Straw Man, Alphabet Soup, and Propaganda.   </li>
<li><strong>Blind Loyalty</strong> (also Blind Obedience, Unthinking Obedience, the "Team Player" appeal, the Nuremberg Defense): The dangerous fallacy that an argument or action is right simply and solely because a respected leader or source (a President, expert, one’s parents, one's own "side," team or country, one’s boss or commanding officers) says it is right. This is over-reliance on authority, a gravely corrupted argument from ethos that puts loyalty above truth,  above one's own reason and above conscience. In this case a person attempts to justify incorrect, stupid or criminal behavior by whining "That's what I was told to do, </li>
</ol>
<p>"Its unpatriotic to not get the vaccine" "Science has proven vaccines harmless - look how they helped in the past"</p>
<p>we see through this bullshit because we dont have pea brained memories and we dont align with left-right politics. We saw how the deep state was lining it up to be "Trump's Vaccine" however Joe Biden won and now the Reverse card has been dealt. Worldwide, its much more dire, those governments are too far corrupt and controlled by the international elite, thats why we see vaccine passports being rammed through high courts in places like Ireland.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Brainwashing</strong> (also, Propaganda, "Radicalization."): The Cold War-era fantasy that an enemy can instantly win over or "radicalize" an unsuspecting audience with their vile but somehow unspeakably persuasive "propaganda,"  e.g., "Don't look at that website! They're trying to brainwash you with their propaganda!" Historically, "brainwashing" refers more properly to the inhuman Argumentum ad Baculum of  "beating an argument into" a prisoner via a combination of pain, fear, sensory or sleep deprivation, prolonged abuse and sophisticated psychological manipulation (also, the "<strong>Stockholm Syndrome</strong>."). Such "brainwashing" can also be accomplished by pleasure ("<strong>Love Bombing</strong>,"); e.g., "Did you like that? I know you did. Well, there's lots more where that came from when you sign on with us!" (See also, "Bribery.") An unspeakably sinister form of persuasion by brainwashing involves deliberately addicting a person to drugs and then providing or withholding the substance depending on the addict's compliance. Note: Only the <em>other</em> side brainwashes. "We" <em>never</em> brainwash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Complex Question</strong>: The contemporary fallacy of demanding a direct answer to a question that cannot be answered without first analyzing or challenging the basis of the question itself. E.g., "Just answer me 'yes' or 'no':  Did you think you could get away with plagiarism and not suffer the consequences?" Or, "Why did you rob that bank?" Also applies to situations where one is forced to either accept or reject complex standpoints or propositions containing both acceptable and unacceptable parts. A corruption of the argument from logos. A counterpart of Either/Or Reasoning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The complex question is often times used to discredit several conspiracies, "Do you really think the US government would collude with the Chinese government over something like this? Look at the Trade war, look at the Hong Kong Protests" meanwhile those were engineered long before as propaganda to cement the idea and distract from how we are being divided and conquered</p>
<p>Source for the above fallacies: <a href="http://utminers.utep.edu/omwilliamson/ENGL1311/fallacies.htm">http://utminers.utep.edu/omwilliamson/ENGL1311/fallacies.htm</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Dog-whistle politics, deliberate ignorance (see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil), confirmation bias, the excluded middle fallacy, heroes all, no true scotsman, moral superiority, the list goes on and on and on some more.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All of these have been used in some way to trick very smart and very intelligent people into thinking otherwise, to question themselves. Frankly, as I am typing this up I'm guilty of falling for some of these as my internal pendulum swung from March 2020 until now.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Well gee, u/DavidHill76, dont you think if there's <em>this many</em> logical fallacies to point out then maybe its Occam's Razor? and it just simply is? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>Argumentum ad Reductio</em>, I say. </p>
<p>One thing that some members of this group have been doing that we all need to do is archiving off-line copies of everything.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>See, this is something I wish I did back when I started reading conspiracy theories as a past-time in 2013. </p>
<p>Around 2015, I had dabbled in it all. Alex Jones was too nutty and Joe Rogan was just the Fear Factor/UFC commentator guy, I had no idea about his podcast. Plus, I was too busy becoming a financial advisor and studying for my investment exams and certifications. </p>
<p>Around this time was the hunger strike by some rich college kid after the incident where police killed a black man in Ferguson, Missouri. Sometime later, BLM shut down the bridge in Memphis.</p>
<p>I remember at that time thinking, "wow this stuff is like on repeat in the news cycle and the only people pointing it out are these crazy conspiracy nut jobs on the internet"</p>
<p>Also around this same time, I was following one user here on reddit who always had very detailed, well written, &amp; well cited and documented posts.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anonymous was getting big, BLM was getting heated, Bernie was being demonized as a socialist commie, and this user was getting fed up with everyone still being asleep.</p>
<p>He sourced all of his previous posts predicting what would happen next. It was almost nostradamus style. He never gave specifics like dates or events, but they were on point. They called out the Deep states bullshit, they proved that the World Economic Forum was a problem, he was making posts about how smart phones would have tracking technology and you wouldnt be able to take out your battery, almost all the apps would have access to your camera and microphone through the patriot act (this post was in 2014 - I remember having facebook friends first realizing this stuff in 2019 and posting about in a 'lol oh well' manner). </p>
<p>This person was playing 3D chess</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The scariest part about this user was that he or she claimed to be a defector. An elite defector. He was born into it and went with it until he or she could no longer morally stand for it. </p>
<p>He posted about all of the plans, getting rid of paper money, tracking every human like cattle, the trickle up economics of <em>power.</em> This is where alot of conspiracy theorists lose it and lose credibility because they start attributing this to some religious thing, some kind of "mark of the devil"</p>
<p>maybe it's because we are infiltrated, maybe its because a lot of people arent able to intrinsically understand marketing, capitalism, and an increasingly technological world.</p>
<p>Intelligence lies on a bell curve and we need to be kind to everyone, but just know that this isnt some pathway to "the mark of the beast" or some grand biblical conspiracy. Thats all thrown in their by the same side thats doing this evil to make us look bad, to discredit us.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is about what it has always been about...</p>
<p><strong><em>Power</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&amp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Control</em></strong></p>
<p>Its very hard to give up once you have it, and you only want more and more.  Seriously, this is human nature, its why bullies exist, its why managers manage, and its why presidents and all rulers have so much trouble giving up their previous post.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's also because the economic system we implemented almost dictates this happen, and by this I mean being tracked, paying for every little thing. It's 6 sigma on a global-human scale.</p>
<p>The economy can only grow and expand if more people consume, and cant hide. And it will all be done in the name of convenience. </p>
<p>I'll be honest, I love <em>Tap-to-Pay</em> with my credit card. Its quick, easy, and I have more time to veg out and scroll on reddit.</p>
<p>How much <em>more</em> convenient would it be to walk into a gas station pick up your items and walk out knowing full well you paid for them because they had microchips and your phone sensed it and the transaction completed upon breaking the barrier of the entryway?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Dont lie, it sounds fantastic! A lot of people would easily sign up for this convenience factor for a litany of reasons.</p>
<p>The problem is the power and transparency it gives and the deeper, darker evil that can be done with this level of technology.</p>
<p>All of this has been happening for generations. My son will only know smart phones and whatever new tech comes out as he ages.</p>
<p>Some of us here remember a time before the internet.</p>
<p>Some of us here will only know a regulated and systemically controlled internet.</p>
<p>Some of us here will only know a world of vaccines and immuno-boosters every 6 months, they will only know forced happiness.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So to those of you who have been here awhile, please keep being kind and remember they want us to fight and argue back to keep us divided. The only way to win this is with patience and kindness towards those who dont know whats happening- they are confused, hurt, shocked, lost, and frightened. Frightened and scared animals lash out viciously to defend themselves. Our <em>fellow humans</em> have been groomed to be this way over a lifetime and generations have only known pain, it is our human duty to relieve them as best as possible. In a world full of lepers be a Mother Teresa.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And to those of you are new, please continue to ask questions, please continue to think critically, please continue to be open minded. You dont have to believe that the earth is flat to be a conspiracy theorist, you dont have to believe "Bush did 9/11" (another example of a propogandist logical fallacy), you dont have to believe in the Illuminati, its not a requirement to wear a tinfoil hat. All you have to do to be a conspiracy theorist is be a critical thinker. That's all.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And oh, be kind (but its ok if you're not always)</p></p>

<p>Did you know there’s a conspiracy behind the term “conspiracy theorist”? There’s a Yahoo article on it if you google. </p>
<p>I’m new to reddit/this sub. I’ll have to join conspiracy.</p>
<p>I’m curious what you think about crypto/decentralized blockchains. I’m optimistic it is a legitimate way to give power back to the people.  Who knows, it could all go horribly wrong as well.</p>
<p>Really appreciate the message of tolerance and basically showing love.  </p>
<p>It’s also a conspiracy that social media is designed to do that to people; get em hooked and arguing.</p>

<p>That may be true for the original theorist who is double-checking evidence of those around...but the people who blindly follow, rejecting evidence provided and accepting conjecture, hearsay, or circumstance as gospel...they are not critical thinkers because they should be equally critical of the conspiracy.</p>
