    <strong>Opposite Day</strong>
    <p><p>The question, "When did you realize that this was all bullshit?" or some variation thereof has been asked here a couple times, and I always like reading the answers. It's just really interesting to me to see what different events or moments or culmination of things lead to people calling it for themselves, and I like how it's different things for everyone.</p>
<p>In an attempt to understand the other side a little better, and because it's probably illegal to ask this anywhere else, I would like to know: for those of you who haven't been on the "This is BS" train since the <em>very</em> start, but have since gotten on, what made you afraid or anxious about the virus in the first place?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I have noticed among all of the people who have offered - unprovoked - to me that they have been vaccinated (and proceeded to pry into <em>my</em> medical history), there is a similar trend: they all describe feeling a huge sense of relief because they can now go about life feeling a little less scared about getting sick.</p>
<p>This is something that I have had a hard time understanding for the most part, simply because I just have not been afraid of this, and I've just gone about my life the best I can without <em>ever</em> feeling truly afraid. it's not like I think I'm untouchable or special or too smart or whatever, the fear just never took hold of me.  I think there was maybe a week or so in there somewhere where I thought, "Ok dude, maybe you should take this seriously." It might have been hearing my parents be worried about it, but it could also have just been a bad bout of watching too much news.</p></p>

        <p>For me the biggest tell was when some governors started ordering nursing homes, in which some of the most vulnerable reside, to take in active cases- at a time when the rest were being ordered to stay at home and economies were being shut down because of the uncontrollable contagiousness.</p>
<p>This was concurrent with special emergency field hospitals being set up to deal with the predicted overwhelming crush of Covid cases (the field hospitals were NEVER used).</p>
<p>This was only confirmed with the glut of inconsistencies highlighted by the sudden support for large BLM and ANTIFA riots over the summer- while the leftist foot was maintained on the neck of local economies and healthy people were stripped of their livelihoods because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>You just can't make this shit up- no one with a brain would believe it.</p>

        <p>I was aware of the virus in Nov 2019, and watching it spread in China then eventually Iran etc., I knew it would go global.</p>
<p>From December 2019 to March 2020 I was pretty cautious.  One of the only people that wore a mask where I live, used gloves when I shopped or pumped gas, only went grocery shopping once a month etc.</p>
<p>In March my employer was forced to shut down. I took a couple months off and enjoyed unemployment and spent most that time outdoors, unmasked, not thinking much about things.  I was fine just hiking and kayaking and ignoring the situation.</p>
<p>Summer 2020 I found myself a new job.  I was fairly nervous.  I was the only employee that wore a mask, and I was within 6' of 100-300 people daily.</p>
<p>After a few days I ditched the mask.</p>
<p>After a few weeks I thought hmm....</p>
<p>After a month or two I wondered  what the fuck was I doing a few months ago?</p>
<p>Here I was coming into contact with 1,000+ people a week and never caught shit.</p>
<p>A bit later the mask mandate was lifted, bars could stay open later, gyms re-opened to full capacity etc.  I dove right in.  No mask shopping whenever I felt like going, no mask working out at the gym, dining out for the first time in a year etc.</p>
<p>Still haven't caught shit.  Tested negative every single time for over a year.</p>
<p>I know the situation is different everywhere and some people are immunocompromised yadda yadda, but its amazing to me there's still people unwilling to visit friends and family, go outside unmasked etc.</p>

        <p>Oh wow what a ride! It almost reads like a coming of age story. 
I remember hearing someone being interviewed on NPR in February 2020 about being locked down in Wuhan and even then it didn’t click for me that something was going down. How naive.</p>

        <p>Well I wasnt buying it from the getgo, but if you wanna know the moment I realised this really going absolutely the wrong way was:</p>
<p>When german Dr. Wolgang Wodarg got called conspiracy theorist by all of MSM for putting out a video, claiming Virologist are overreacting. It was surreal, its not that he made any conspiratorial claims, he was merely suggesting that some Virologists are overreacting.</p>

        <p>I initially was not sure what to make of this episode, but I had  even then known for a long time better than to take anything the corpo-prop says at face value...
After they started forcing shutdowns I thought "oh, shit... this is cover for the financial collapse that everyone with more intelligence that a starfish has known was coming, and they are going to get a nato-common currency and cashlessness and nato-federal type-union out of all this"</p>
<p>Then as things progressed, it became more apparent to me that the financial collapse and the other things I mentioned were only another piece of the greater puzzle that was really the endgame of global governance and implementation of a-21. Now they are openly saying that's what they are trying to do, not mentioning the a-21 moniker, but stating their goals as being the same as what it outlined</p>
