        <p>I'm an international DJ, when it kicked off in 2019 I was travelling, going to clubs, no social distancing, still clubbing until now. No masks whenever I can. Never got it!</p>

        <p>I wore the mask and social distanced. But that was about it. My life went unchanged for the most part. I still traveled, probably more so, since shit was cheaper. Went out to eat. Saw my friends. </p>
<p>Very few inconveniences through it all.</p>

        <p>I am NOT a denier but I realized early on this wasn't what we were being told it was. I went through living hell here I am permanently grossed out by just about everyone at this point except people who have some sort of intellectual curiosity and are asking questions. I have never felt so isolated and like such an outcast... I thank God for the small handful of people in my life who maintained their sanity throughout this. There was a point where I frustration cried daily because I just wanted to be around normal people who didn't look at me like a disease vector . When I'm out in the street sometimes I look around me and think to myself, you are the people that gleefully sealed me inside my apartment for the better part of a year. You are the people that let fear control you and most of you have been triggered into severe OCD and you held mentally healthy people hostage during this entire thing. I guess you could say I'm a tad bitter LOL I was born here and I've lived here most of my life and I can't wait to get out. I can't live around the people who live here anymore there are too many permanently damaged people and I see who they really are. I had to rent a car once a month and get out of here to maintain my sanity.</p>

        <p>I hear ya. Most of my family is in California. We used to align politically, but after all of this, it's hard to have conversations with them about anything meaningful. Same with my vaccinated friends. We're all still close, but conversations have become very superficial and limited. </p>
<p>It seems that those that are strong willed, secure, solid principals have made it this far without folding to the pressure. Stubbornness can be a strength. </p>
<p>Stay strong and true to yourself. </p>
<p>I started meditating. Not because all of this, I started right before all this started happening. I found it to be helpful. Just disconnecting mentally for a while.</p>

        <p>I definitely should start doing something like meditation you're right. I feel the same as you, I have conversations with people I was once close to but it's so superficial. And I feel like I'm tip-toeing around being careful not to say anything that would make them think I am a white supremacist Grandma killer lol it's just too much. There are people that I wasn't as close to before that I've gotten much closer to 2 though, we talked about all this stuff because we don't have anyone else in our lives to talk to so at least I'm not completely alone with all this but it is very difficult.</p>

        <p>Maybe you "had it" but your immune system just bullied it... I think it was strong in the winter and early spring of 2020 but quickly weakened as it spread. It was made in china so it definitely wasn't built to last... I also am of the belief that the world has reached herd immunity and that the only thing keeping fear alive is pneumonia from masks, sickness from too much time indoors and overall unhealthy living, and vaxx side effects. I have only heard like one person cough in the last 10 months at work or out and about in daily life. And the one person who was sick had pneumonia... again I think from masking.</p>

        <p>Pretty much if it is truly a 'highly contagious airborne killer virus variant', everyone is infected anyway...</p>
<p>a 30 cent Mask isnt' going to protect anyone, and anyone with hair is going to collect it like a net in the sea catching fish and bring it home with them and fling it all over the place into everyone else's face, all  over their home and into the air.</p>
<p>It's stupid to think that such a dangerous virus could ever be stopped in by a population who doesn't take Bio Lab decontamination airlock and other measures that would be needed.</p>

        <p>Not really.  Most people haven't contracted the virus.  The tests are completely faulty.  I design antibody tests, and quite a few people at work who 'tested' positive - were completely lacking antibodies.  Those who got sick, they display antibody.  Those vaxxed, display antibody.</p>
<p>The PCR tests are complete crap.</p>

        <p>I have not had it. Iâ€™ve barely been sick the last 5 years. Starter taking zinc and vitamin D when this started. I guess my immunste system is working.</p>

        <p>I haven't had it, or any type of sickness at all in about 15 years now. My dad is 74 and has gone out every day and hasn't caught it either, even when friends he'd spent time with ended up having it. My bf has flown to Boston and California multiple times and been around all sorts of people, he hasn't had it either. </p>
<p>Exercise, eat vegetables, take vitamin D.</p>

        <p>What?! AFAIK I haven't had it - but who knows? I have been sick a few times over the last year.</p>
<p>Are you one of those people that gets yourself tested when you get mildly ill or something?</p>

        <p>I've been tested twice since the start. No covid. Curiously enough I haven't had so much as a sniffle since 2019. Typically I get a 1 - 2 day cold once every year or 2.</p>
