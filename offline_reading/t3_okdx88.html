    <strong>What to do if sceptical family members have suddenly had a change of heart and are now going to line up to get vaccinated?</strong>
    <p><p>My mother I am very close to has always said she did not want the vaccine, she'd rather wait. Now she's finally giving in and I really don't want to see her harmed. Plus, she's the only one that was in my camp. I don't know why but this feels like a slap. I'm worried about her and I just don't know what to do.</p>
<p>I think my father kept pestering her?</p>
<p>Edit:  She was against it from the start, still says she's more scared of the jab than Covid itself (which she suspects she caught from me when I had it. She just stayed home 14 days but got no test).</p>
<p>She might need to travel internationally because of my grandmother who is in unstable health. She's worried she might not be allowed on the plane. That's why she is about to changer her mind. </p>
<p>Plus her ex-husband - my dad - is pressuring her into it.</p></p>

        <p>It's her choice at the end of the day. If you want to be afforded the same curtesy you can't be angry at her for taking it. The vaccines may have zero long term effects as well, we don't know. Just hope that she isn't one of the individuals who experiences one of the "rare" short term effects.</p>

        <p>Exactly this! I love this sentiment! </p>
<p>We have a right to make our own choice to decline the vaccine as others have the right to take it. </p>
<p>Also, we don’t know the long term effects. Some are willing to get it and risk that, some who have comorbidities may actually need it cause they have an actual risk if dying from COVID. Albeit, that may be a double edged sword, a catch 22. But time will be our teacher, and I am willing to wait for long term data as are many of you. </p>
<p>My family for example, Dad, Mom, Brother, Uncle, Aunt all got the vaccine. My parents are mid 50s, uncle and aunt late 50s, brother 20s. They all had no bad side effects. Again, time will tell how long that remains true and I hope it does. I haven’t gotten it, and I won’t for a long time. </p>
<p>Most my friends got it, but I know people in the same boat I am in. It helps knowing people out there thinking the same. I am stubborn and don’t mind rowing the boat alone. But don’t be scared, you are never alone. Some people are rowing alone too, maybe you will bump into them sooner or later! </p>
<p>Just as long as you think for yourself and make an educated decision, thats all we can ask for. Not to be forced to take a vaccine.</p>

        <p>She would be taking it because of social pressure but says she's more scared of the vaccine than covid itself because we think she had it when I had it. I had a mild flu and she had a head cold. She wasn't tested for it, though, she just stayed home for two weeks.</p>

        <p>Well if it is just for social pressure let her know you support her not getting it. It doesn’t make her a bad person to look out for her own health! Who else is going to look out for your own health? </p>
<p>If she has concerns and wants to wait on it, why not wait?</p>

        <p>She says she's more scared of getting it than Covid because she suspects she already caught it from me back in the day. But she fears not being able to air travel should her mother fall ill or die. That's her reason. If it was up to her, she says, she wouldn't take it.</p>

        <p>I don't know. She has been vaccinated and has been fine during the pandemic but lately she's been eating less and the like, being less active and just slowing down a lot and my mother is just worried that if the time comes and she needs to travel, they won't let her.</p>
<p>My father, her ex, is heavily telling her to do it (he's been vaccinated himself) and is saying he'll set up an appointment for her next week and the like.</p>
<p>It's an international flight so I get why she'd be worried. I don't know what to do or tell her. This is what happens with all these stupid rules.</p>
<p>As I said, I had it and she was sick during the same time. We heavily suspect we've already had it. But everyone - the government, the GP, everyone is saying we need to take the jab anyway.</p>

        <p>What left an impression with my fiancée's dad was showing him the censoring of Malone and the criminal history of Pfizer and others. He was about to give in to similar pressure and this reassured him.     </p>
<p>If she gets the first shot, fine. Ask her to wait out at least the second one until (after) winter to see if the short term effects have the large impact on "vaccinated" we believe it will.</p>

        <p>The problem is that my father is putting pressure on her. I don't want to be like that and I am only one voice. She is not convinced but she feels like they will not let you do anything if you don't get it. And as I said, my grandma isn't doing too well so she is prepared to fly out at short notice and now wonders if they could deny her that if this draconian measures tighten.</p>

        <p>It’s her choice. It’s ok to worry about her and disagree with her choice (just keep it to yourself). My own mother was against the vaccine because it’s experimental and there’s no longer term research and then she got diagnosed with breast cancer and caved in after the drs encouraged her to get the jab just before she had a double mastectomy! Truthfully that made me mad because there is NO research showing how the jab affected cancer patients or how it affects you after surgery so close to the vaccine! So far she has not had any issues except a bad reaction after the first chemo treatment. Then there is my dad who also got cancer last year (bladder cancer) and has a pulmonary embolism! And is on blood thinners. At first he wasn’t going to get it because he was told people on blood thinners can’t get it but his dr said he could so he got it!!I am just thankful he hasn’t suffered anymore blood clots and the PE hasn’t burst! I would have rather neither of them got the jab but at the end of the day it was their decision and I just keep my fingers crossed the jab doesn’t cause problems for them later. I remind myself that I don’t want them telling me how to manage my health either and I sure as hell don’t want them telling me to get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Show her the <a href="https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data">database of vaccine side effects</a>.  If she's had COVID, then she's already immune.  Make sure she knows that none of the vaccines have completed clinical trials or been tested on animals.  Here are <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">more reasons not to get vaxxed</a>.</p>
<p>As much as your grandmother would love to see your mother, I doubt she'd want her to risk her health, possibly her life, to make the trip.</p>
