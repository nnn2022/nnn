    <strong>Potential working Theory: Thallium Poisoning</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Thallium [TI] Atomic Symbol #81</strong></p>
<p>So, it's a working theory, but we have the unpleasant pleasure of watching someone close to me die from this vaccine. I've been keeping notes daily, from appetite to mood changes and discoloration. </p>
<p>When I met this person, they were just beginning to explore heavy metal poisoning from excessive imaging in the past, and their current personality reminds me of who they were before they detoxed. They've received their second Moderna shot roughly 65 days ago. They also are Type 2 Diabetic who recently was off insulin and managing symptoms with ONLY diet and exercise.</p>
<p>No reported issues after the first: They admitted later it was sore.</p>
<p>Second shot: throbbing and pain at the site and pain up into the shoulder. Steady, slow decline in energy, mood, healing from an eye surgery BEFORE the shot [healing has stopped, eye is getting worse, more pain, eye is visually red and swollen] and quality of life. Negative magnet check on the injection site. Gained 21 pounds since, currently dependent again on insulin.</p>
<p>We had a conversation today about their past experience with Heavy Metal poisoning, and agreed they feel similar, almost identical symptoms, but is confused why their partner isn't experiencing the same. [received vax at the same time, same location] I suggested he revisit the detox routine they were on to see if symptoms get better.</p>
<p>***May it be noted, I'm not a fucking doctor *** and I LOATH everyone in that industry who isn't helping us get to the bottom of this shit. By the time I'm through doing this, I may as well apply for Med school.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

        <p>I was just tested for toxic metals and I most certainly have thallium poisoning. Lots of symptoms including alopecia. None of my dermatologists - who are "experts" in alopecia - know this. We suspect it came from several sources but I had to see an integrated medicine doctor to get tested.</p>
