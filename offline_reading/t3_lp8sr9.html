    <strong>People don't care about the greater good, they care about virtue and narratives they agree with</strong>
    <p><p>Mask mandates and "banning misinformation" is what these people want. Cause "misinformation" these days is anything they disagree with. Masks scientifically are proven to not work, but these people want to virtue-signal and pretend science supports them. These same people say you can be fat and healthy. It's not about authority, they disregard science that disagrees with them. If Facebook called all things left wing misinformation these people would flip and they know it. </p>
<p>They act like the government knows best. But if the government decided that they're gonna track you to make sure you exercise daily and/or ban candy, alcohol, etc these people would flip out. Even though exercise is good and candy, alcohol, etc is bad.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah they've been outed multiple times for their hypocrisy. Those people claiming to want unity and that we're 'all in this together' are the same ones who were buying and hoarding all the tp &amp; food at the start of this plandemic. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>Ass backwards they are.</p>

        <p>The greater good narrative or ‚Äúthe protecting lives‚Äù breaks the minute when they‚Äôre gloating over someone‚Äôs death, make fun of someone‚Äôs mental health (belittling, laughing, gaslighting) hoping that you die if you don‚Äôt wear a mask or want to send you to some ‚Äúcamps‚Äù</p>
