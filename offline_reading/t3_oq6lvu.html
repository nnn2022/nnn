        <p>Well, it all is going to lead to a massive reduction in births and continued transfer of wealth to the medical industry....</p>
<p>I feel for trans people. Their choices, which they are being hypnotized into making, are leading them to horrific outcomes.  They become dependent on pharmaceuticals and constant validation.</p>
<p>I have one trans female friend from my old job (she gets pissed at me on FB for sure) and we would have morning bonding time sort of where a question is asked and we go around in a circle answering it after saying our names and pronouns. (Five points to anyone who can guess the state and city)</p>
<p>The question was what your worst fear is.  She said that it was that she would never be accepted as a woman.</p>
<p>And it's like... she is offered this completely impossible promise that if she just goes through all of these biologically destructive human experiments, she'll somehow be in the body she was supposed to be.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the scarring involved with this, and the fact that the body is holographic means that she will never fully recover from the surgery. </p>
<p>And instead of interventions to conform the mind to the much wiser body... she is voluntarily getting the sort of treatment that Mengele did to concentration camp inmates.</p>
<p>And if you criticize any aspect of this process you are a nazi... they are indoctrinating kindergarteners in this extremely confusing worldview. </p>
<p>It is maddening and disturbing. And likely the class of eunuchs they are creating, and in fact brainwashing the most vulnerable members of society, into joining, is one aspect of a population control plan. Just like the shot that turns your body into a spike protein factory. </p>
<p>SMH. </p>
<p>And in most subs this would get downvoted to oblivion when it is a genuinely compassionate view of an issue that is destroying lives.</p>

        <p>"Modern medicine can turn a man into a woman and a woman into a man" is a candidate for "big lie" of the century. We're going to be dealing with and caring for the victims of that broken promise for the rest of our lives. My intense skepticism of the reasons people transition aside, they are clearly being sold a bill of goods and the false promise that they will look like, feel like, and be indistinguishable from the opposite sex. It's just not a real thing. </p>
<p>Many do understand this completely and stop short for that reason, but these irreversible procedures are being pushed on younger and younger people with the promise that it will solve everything for them. </p>
<p>Maybe not NNN subject matter, but it sure seems like another side of the general insanity that has exploded across society the last two years.</p>

        <p>Hundred percent agree.</p>
<p>I talk to people about it, and I treasure the one trans friend I have and give her pushback on facebook.</p>
<p>My oldest brother has become an SJW to the point that it is difficult to communicate with him, but I have been able to both get my perspective across and understand his.</p>
<p>He says that the people who are really making a difference and supporting the castouts of society are usually led by the queer and disabled... and he contests that this is a natural phenomenon because they are not put there as tokens, but rather have the experience to provide the compassion that people need.</p>
<p>And so he says we must follow the disenfranchised...</p>
<p>And I can kind of get behind that except that trans definitions are so mercurial, and most of their rhetoric flies in the face of obvious facts of nature and biology.</p>
<p>They are taken in when vulnerable and ripped from the natural order and there is no freedom to even question it, because questioning their world view is now considered a hate crime.</p>
<p>And I can follow that argument. Dismissing the arguments that they use to justify their rejection of the natural order can give justification to the hateful to hate.</p>
<p>However, obviously, they have a problem both mentally and physically, and of the two the body is the more trustworthy.  Is it true that the ones truly helping are the queer?  Because when I was homeless (bad breakup coupled with some mental and emotional instability...) it was Christians.</p>
<p>Like, there is a denial of some very basic and obvious facts.  Christians, for all their flaws, have been the ones to truly be there for me, a stranger. I did not see anyone in the queer community organizing the help.  I did see a few who were crushed by life and accepting help.</p>
<p>A Mexican man named Israel of all things actually brought me into his home and gave me the support I needed. I met him at church. He was a recovering schitzophrenic and crack head. And a saint in the making.</p>
<p>These are just musings. And I think it is all tied together in the demonization of truth and the reorganization of society, therefore fitting for this sub, particularly on a post referencing the Marxist war on nature. </p>
<p>I would love to see a stable queer society. It would be super interesting. I would not want it in my living room... and media is putting some fantasized and produced version of it right in front of us.</p>
<p>I would love to see a successful Communist society for that matter.  And Fascist as well. I would love to see these ideas tested and made to benefitntheir adherents. </p>
<p>But my own ideas for the world I want are so very different from these inquisitors.  And that is my God-given right.</p>

<p>What he is saying is contained in many works by many occult writers. This is why they push trans and many of your leaders are trans. But just call people names and pretend you did the research.</p>

<p>Seek professional help. You reading articles on the internet isn’t doing research so let’s not pretend you do research. Research means you actually gather information and can document it</p>

<p>If I post something racist in TMoR and screenshot it before the mods get to remove it, does that mean I get to say that TMoR is a racist shithole too?</p>

        <p>Those comments were removed because they were brigaded from the people who saw my post. I mean. No new normal is an anti Semitic shit hole. There’s a lot of posts here comparing covid to the Holocaust. </p>
<p>And, there was a comment saying covid should be treated like it was in Tanzania. Yanno… where they denied it was a thing until their president died of it. </p>
<p>It most certainly does count. Even if the mods did remove those comments which I know they didn’t, it shows the kind of people who contribute here. It shows the people this group attracts. That says enough.</p>

        <p>But I showed u proof of studies that show that, for example, trans women have the brains of cis women, and trans men have the brains of cis men. Thoes are studies done by scientists and psychologists multiple times that prove that trans men are men and trans women are women. Also I don't think a random person on reddit will know more that scientists, psychologists and therapists who say that trans women are women and trans men are men. U can ignore it all u want, but it won't change the truth.</p>

        <p>The brains of "trans women" contain XY chromosomes.  They do not have the brains of "cis women"</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a trans woman, just a man in a dress having a delusion.</p>
<p>"Studies" doesn't mean anything.  Let's not forget that scientists also developed heroin as a non-addictive alternative to morphine, so really, scientists track records really aren't that good.  Psychology is a commie myth at best, and Wilhelm Reich was a filthy marxist...and a sexual predator...much like men in dresses tend to be.</p>
<p>You can cry all you want and push your pseudoscience, but it requires the re-defining of term (as the trans movement is nothing more than an sad attempt to dismantle society) and forced acceptance of your ridiculous terms and premises.  It's all fake, it's all a lie, you know it, I know it and everyone reading this knows it.</p>
<p>Rainbows are, and always will be an Abrahamic religious symbol, just remember that.</p>

Big Pharma, international liberals and billion dollar corporations co-opting identity politics to make sure everyone is taking their drugs and staying aggro at all times. If gender is just a social construct, then you don't need HRT, it's just a belief. But if Big Pharma has anything to say about it, you need drugs to make you what you want to be</p>

        <p>Well I'm not trans so I'm not an expert myself but as far as I'm concerned while it's true that gender it's a social construct (in contraposition to the term sex which applies to the biological aspects of the individuals determined by their anatomy) and therefore it include all the norms, behaviours and roles associated with being a man or a woman.</p>
<p>If somebody doesn't feel like their assigned genre (we get an assigned sex based on our genitals when we are born and we are treated in different ways regarding our sex and that's how the genre is assigned to us?) maybe at a subconscious level they feel as if their bodies were more similar to those of the gender they feel they are society will treat them the way the would someone who's genre corresponds to their assigned sex at birth? </p>

        <p>No, it's not confusing but if gender is a social construct then you don't need drugs to change it. And if you feel like you're more man than woman, then that's gender dysphoria which requires proper counselling and treatment not a lifelong subscription to drugs to force your body into being what the Pharmaceutical company says it should be. Mental illness has and will always exist but treating it with drugs because that's what the corporation says you should do is a new and bastardised opinion dreamt up by the guys pushing those drugs and supported by the ones they pay off</p>

        <p>Sorry I'm not sure that I'm understanding well, when you say that gender dysphoria is a mental illness what do you mean exactly? Do you mean that the mental illness that needs counselling it's the distress caused by the dysphoria or the fact that the person it's experiencing dysphoria itself?</p>

        <p>Yes, a man who believes he is a woman or vice versa is suffering from mental illness. You can't change your sex, that's been recognised a long time ago. It's why transsexual has been phased out in favour of transgender. You can change your gender but changing your gender doesn't mean anything because it doesn't exist. Pharmaceutical corporations telling you you can change your gender if you eat their magic beans though, it's a corporate selling point and nothing more</p>
