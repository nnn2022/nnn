<title>Is this really what's going on in the "Fight Against Misinformation™️"? I assumed this was common knowledge, yet here I was banned because of it. How odd. Can someone explain? *Aside from city specific subs being full of actual Covidiots*.</title>

        <p>The reason you were banned is so that people who are undecided were not influenced by your statement of truth.  They need to keep people in the dark and under control for as long as possible</p>

<p>They hand out bans like candy in that sub.  It's pathetic.</p>
<p>I don't know if you noticed, but they've hidden the names of the moderators.  I suspect this is to limit their accountability, of which there is none in that subreddit.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if someone on that mod team works for the Liberal Party.  About six months before the Election, pretty much every Conservative who made any reasonable point was banned without explanation.  I made a list of people banned pre election, and it was something like 98% Conservative or "Independent".  </p>
<p>They are pathetic shills.  Despite its name, that subreddit does not represent the views of Canadians</p>

        <p>/r/canada is one of the most censored subs on reddit. If pointing out that they were rushed for emergency use is controversial... Imagine trying to explain that there was a vast conspiracy to not provide the public with information regarding valuable preventative medicine and treatments. </p>
<p>Why would they do this?</p>
<p>Because in order to qualify for emergency approval, there must not be ANY alternative treatments that are available.</p>
<p>Now, does everyone remember the Cathedral's effort to smear any professional who recommended  hydroxychloroquine. Or how you were a QUACK for recommending vitamin C and D, but once the vaccines were approved vitamin C and D were now part of the official narrative.</p>

        <p>Agreed. It was very odd however that just yesterday on Global Radio they agreed that Authorization does not equate to Approval. However the moment that sound byte was over they then stated that the definition of Injection v. Ingestion was also skewed for a narrative. Global News is peculiar, must be a fun office with the varying views.</p>

<p>I've been banned from my provincial sub for telling an obvious shill that if I had one dollar for every time he called someone a "covidiot" I'd be richer than Bezos.</p>
