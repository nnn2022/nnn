    <strong>Dear doomsters, stop blaming us for the consequences of the policies you support.</strong>
    <p><p>I hate seeing comments saying 'thanks to you guys, I can't go to my prom I was looking forward to this year' or 'it's thanks to you guys, that we can't go back to normal'. Stop blaming us for the impacts of policies you support. We WANT you to live your life freely, we WANT you to be able to go on dates or go to restaurants in peace. The government DOESN'T want you to. So blame the government not us. And no, that one anti-masker in Walmart isn't the reason that this seasonal, highly contagious  virus (90% of cases were compliant people, or contracting it in their homes) is still spreading. Take a look at California, and then compare it to Florida. According to you, Florida is full of dumb redneck free-thinking boomer Karen's who just want people to die.</p>
<p>And yet somehow, despite being fatter, poorer and more disabled with worse medicare, and little restrictions Florida has 1.49 deaths per 1000, and California has had 1.4 deaths per 1000* - a negligible difference (and they have been ahead of California numerous times), despite Cali being full of insufferable yuppie techie affluent middle class pillocks who have shat on all it means to be a hippie and sticking it to the man. Sweden is doing better than the UK, despite the differences in approach, and Texas hasn't experienced the surge you guys predicted. Lockdowns clearly don't work, but the powers at be are pretending they do because they are making an absolute fortune out of this pandemic. For example, in the UK, Matt Wanksock is best buddies with the man supplying government PPE equipment. Vaccine companies know that 20 year olds have more chance of dying from the vaccine itself than from coronavirus will force it on them anyway. Why? Cos of that sweet sweet Moneeeeehhhhh. And people like us, who expose this corruption and discuss ways to fight it are demonized by the MSM and therefore you. WE are the reason this is carrying on. WE are the reason you can't see your family or experience your youth. No, we aren't. The government is, and you support the policies condemning you to a life of misery and confinement. Stop blaming us. You are responsible for this misery. Not us. You think you're being virtuous and schooling the dumb flat-earthers. But you aren't. Notice how you don't troll r/LockdownSkepticism. Because you don't want to face the mounting proof and evidence that you are in fact not as smart and virtuous as you think you are, but you can't be bothered to do research, basic mathematics, which is why you leave that sub alone, and target our sub instead.</p>
<p>The government will not let you go back to normal until you go, 'fuck it'. You are just a useful big pharma industry tool. You think you're doing people favours, but the big pharma companies who are unfathomably corrupt and have a shocking stranglehold of the government (so they control the mainstream narrative- notice anyone who stands up to them is silenced and vilified, or seen as mentally ill) don't have an honorary picture of you on their office wall, nor care about you, they're are fucking laughing at you. And  probably gobsmacked at just how much you eat it up and actually do their bidding and attack people in their way voluntarily. They are the real psychopaths, not us.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic cases account for roughly 300 of cases** in Wuhan, so there is no feasible reason that asymptomatic people should wear a mask. Asymptomatic is just a way to make healthy people sound sick. And you do realize that when the next pandemic comes around (its not going to be 'once in a century anymore, because we live in a globalized society), we are going to have a collective of unhealthy and inactive people who've weakened their immunity by obsessively spraying everything down all the time. So when an actual pandemic comes, we are actually fucked. There are plenty of scientists*** against this craziness, but they are silenced and discredited, while the paid, spineless government one who dons a lab coat to convince you he's an expert and the front of all knowledge tells you want to think, and gives people who follow what they say a false sense of superiority.  If you want to save sick people, quarantine them, but not healthy people, because thats tyranny.</p>

        <p>We're doing it their way.  We've been doing it their way for over a year now.</p>
<p>If they should be angry at anyone for it not working, it should be themselves and the policies they supported.</p>
<p>This is 100% on them.  They are to blame for the calamity currently happening.</p>

        <p>No I have seen swarms of people since day one practically intentionally breathing in each otherâ€™s air really daring to be infected/spreading disease because they are too healthy and cool to care. Not everyone did it the right way and it is obvious. </p>
<p>I know the arrogance is impervious.</p>
