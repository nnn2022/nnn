    <strong>People are resisting, they are just not obvious about it</strong>
    <p><p>I recently thought that what differentiates us from most is that we cannot not comment on the obvious, like vaccines being harmful and covid being harmless.</p>
<p>Others show passive resistance, without being obvious. They put a mask over their mouth but not their nose for instance.</p>
<p>They focus on what they can do to get on with their lives. They focus on what they can control and try accomplish their goals, just like before just with new parameters.</p>
<p>Because the important realization is: nothing changes because you write anything here. So you could aswell do what you can to go on with your life without the blatantly obvious actions, that are not only short-lived, but also always useless on a bigger scale.</p>
<p>You might get a fine or go to jail and that's it. There is no change in society when you are not wearing a mask or point out the dangers.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't wear a mask, do it for your own sake, not to make a statement. Because nobody cares for your statement(sadly).</li>
<li>If you are against vaccines, do your best to not get vaccinated. But don't waste your time going to demonstrations thinking that would stop vaccinations. It doesn't and demonstrations have always been useful only for socializing, never for the cause.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nobody changes the way you want him to, if you are straight to the point and vocal about it.</p>
<p>People will just say: good that you were punished for it.</p>
<p>You will never motivate the bigger mass with a loud and vocal approach, but with a subtle approach, like a mountain that is being carved out by the sea over time till it collapses.</p></p>

        <p>I have never worn a mask because i know its a scam and it was obvious since day 1 just like all the other nwo scams and hoaxes they constantly running on us and i refuse to go along with it. Not because i think other people will see me non-conforming and then follow along, they will not, because they do not think its a scam.</p>
<p>If i bow to this agenda knowing what it is i will not be able to sleep at night knowing i buckled to it like a coward and that will harm me more than any repercussions from not conforming.</p>
