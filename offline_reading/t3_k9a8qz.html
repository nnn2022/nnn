        <p>I get where you’re coming from. I honestly just thought it was funny, and nice to see these people called out for their bullshit. At the end of the day, people shouldn’t be singling others out if they have exemptions. This is not a law and people are taking it upon themselves to enforce it, backed up by all the repeaters with their self serving bullshit. </p>
<p>I think sometimes being called out and made a fool of can be a good way to make people think twice about what they do in future. And I say this as someone who detests “prank” YouTube videos and social media nobodies acting up in front of the camera.</p>

        <p>No doubt.  Just one of many.  But Starbucks has a lot of other things to answer for, namely, not publicly reprimanding an employee who showed contempt toward law enforcement.  </p>

        <p>What "exemption" does he have?  A private business can refuse service to anyone and its your choice whether you want to comply with their rules to patronize.  My gripe is with politicians who force stores out of business even for trying to comply, not with businesses who want to make their own decisions about "public health".  Im not even being given a choice.</p>

        <p>In the UK they can't, this is literally discrimination against disabled people and the mask mandate rules are that you do not have to provide proof and should not be asked for evidence of an exemption.  Exactly the same logic as if you denied service to someone just because they were in a wheelchair.</p>

        <p>Starbucks can kick you out for any reason they want to.  If you want to file a discrimination lawsuit against them go ahead.  But the judge is probably going to ask for a doctors note.  And your case isnt going to go very far when your "exemption" is "I dont want to wear a mask".</p>

        <p>They can kick you out for whatever reason they like, but that reason may be illegal. For instance, if they kicked you out for being gay, black, a woman, in a wheelchair or not wearing a mask.  So yea, all you are doing is advocating for the huge multinational company Starbucks who pay very little tax in the UK to break the law because most people don't have the time or money to bring a lawsuit against them.  Good job sticking up for the little guy. Tbh, it would be far better if noone ever went in one anyway.</p>

<p>Which is where the lawsuit comes in.  If this guy actually has a medical exemption he should actually sue them for discrimination. It would be a pretty simple case.   I highly doubt he will.</p>

        <p>I see you're a fan of corporations breaking the law because they can get away with it then. Yea, fuck the little guy, let the powerful corporations do whatever they want because people can't afford to go toe to toe with a team of corporate lawyers.  I guess you'd fully support them kicking out minorities or wheelchair users and expect them to fight a court case over it too? Great principles you have.</p>

        <p>We don't know which exemption he has, but common exemption reasons are autism, anxiety/claustrophobia, PTSD, intellectual disabilities, deafness (in a group) and some forms of asthma. People in wheelchair also tends to be exempt if they've mobility issues making taking on and off a mask difficult.</p>
<p>Private businesses should in general speaking be free to refuse service to anyone they wants to and government shouldn't make mask mandates. But at the same time, businesses can't refuse customers services as long a discrimination law exist and doesn't get changed. In some countries there aren't as simple as "if you don't like the business, you can just boycott it" rule. In some countries it goes under the discrimination law if you refuse services based on a disability, race/ethnicity, religion and gender. So, either businesses can't refuse services in all cases or the law has to be changed. Therefor some customers can claim businesses discriminate as long the law says it does.</p>
<p>I believe in as little government intervention as possible, in general speaking (even as a leftie). But as long the government has a mask mandate, I think it's fair to use the discrimination law because of you can't just simply boycott businesses as easily.</p>

        <p>Can a private business refuse to serve a black person because of the colour of their skin? Or a trans person? </p>
<p>I don’t think you watched the video, because in it he explained he was sticking up for a women who was exempt. But there are many reasons for being medically exempt and you can get a doctors note for this. This is written into their “guidelines”. If we aren’t even following their guidelines and we let glorified tea makers (not Starbucks themselves) start making up all the rules, it only ends when people stop being fear mongered to high heaven.. which isn’t gonna happen any time soon.</p>

        <p>You said a private company could refuse anyone. I brought the “could they refuse a black person” to counter that argument. I never said that it had anything to do with this guy. </p>
<p>Again you glossed over the fact there was another women he was sticking up for who may well have had a serious medical condition. Also as other posters have already pointed out, it’s not lawful to ask someone why they are exempt in the uk. </p>
<p>As for why he’s not wearing one, who knows. You are guessing he doesn’t have a medical exemption though. Note how the police had absolutely no problem with it when he spoke to them at the end.</p>

        <p>Frankly I believe they SHOULD be able to refuse a black person, because I believe that customers shouldnt be forced to give money to people that hate them.   </p>
<p>But thats not what this conversation is about.  Youre trying to bring up "protected classes". What "protected class" is this guy part of?  I wont be shocked in the slightest when he doesnt actually file a discrimination lawsuit because he doesnt actually have an "exemption".</p>

        <p>Why are you asking me that? How would I know? And how would you know either way either? Fact of the matter is people are exempt. If you have a problem with that then take it up with the doctors and medical “experts” that allowed it to happen. </p>
<p>Frankly I don’t care wether he has an exemption or not, he should be free to do as he pleases. Just like how you weirdly think that people could refuse service to someone based on the colour of their skin.</p>

        <p>&rt;he should be free to do as he pleases</p>
<p>Just as Starbucks should be free to do as they please.  The question is, are they doing this because THEY want to, or because the govt is forcing them to?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Prior to Covid would you support a liquor store kicking out someone who refuses to take off a mask for fear of being robbed?  Or would you say they're being "discriminatory"?  Frankly its insane this is the new "normal".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Personally, I hate mask mandates and go out of my way to not go anywhere that requires them.  But I equally dislike people who purposefully enter businesses doing things they know they're not supposed to just to film arguments with strangers and then act like they're the victim.  This guys not convincing anyone of anything and just bothering people.  If he really wanted to prove a point he would calmly let them "discriminate" against him, show the evidence to a lawyer and collect a nice hefty paycheck.</p>

        <p>Because they want to. They know the laws and they know they have no right to ask the question about what the persons exemption is. Starbucks didn’t tell them to break the law, and not even the police gave a shit when they were brought in. So actually I’d argue this was on the people, who are acting out of fear. </p>
<p>That’s such a dumb point, I don’t even know where to start. That’s not discriminating against someone for being disabled, is it? That’s someone robbing a store. Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>You don’t sound like someone who hates mask mandates, you sound like someone who just likes to come to these posts and cause trouble, to be honest. For example, you have AGAIN overlooked the fact he was sticking up for a women who was illegally asked to leave the shop. Did you even watch the whole fucking video? Or listen to me when I told you that like 3 times?</p>

<p>I didn't say they were robbing the store. I said they were wearing a a mask and gave a reason why the store might not want them to be inside. So you admit a store should have the ability to tell people they cant enter wearing a mask?  Do you believe there are no medical reasons for why someone might need to wear a mask?  How do you grapple with your own hypocrisy in this statement?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All I see is what's on the video. I see no woman, not wearing a mask, I only have his word for the specifics of what happened, and he seems like a bit of a provocateur, so I'm not inclined to trust his account entirely.   He even says he was asked to leave for not wearing mask too, so the "woman" he was "defending" is irrelevant. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4sbiKmNvY8&amp;ab_channel=CharlesVeitch">Interestingly enough he seems like he disagrees with the overabundance and abuse of "discrimination laws"</a> and yet seems to have no problem calling them into effect when they benefit his viewpoint.  Either people should be allowed to do and say what they want, or they shouldn't.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The thing is I don't even really disagree with the message. I just don't like when people film themselves starting conflicts and then pretend like they're the victim.  That's the entirety of my point.</p>
