    <strong>Has anyone noticed the increase of concern trolling in r/LockdownSkepticism lately?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been following r/LockdownSkepticism for a month or so and the sub has expanded rapidly in that time. However, I keep seeing posts (often written by throwaways) talking about how they are “rethinking their skepticism”, arguing for some sort of “compromise”,  or arguing for part of the pro “New Normal” position. Often using the same appeals to authority and such that pro lockdowners use.</p>
<p>Some examples from the past couple days</p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/h78w8i/are_we_in_denial_is_reopening_leading_to_more/</p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/h7cnf8/the_article_here_says_that_floridas_numbers_are/</p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/h7tcxw/im_nearly_finished_an_mdphd_program_i_agree_with/</p>
<p>And in all fairness users on the sub do rip these to shreds in the comments, but I can’t help but to notice an increase in the concern trolling over there lately.</p></p>

        <p>What bothers me the most about their thread is not necessarily that they like masks, but rather they are attempting to make a "compromise" and asking for us to embrace masks as part of the "new normal" in exchange for ending lockdowns. The majority will not comply with mask-wearing unless <em>forced</em>.</p>
<p>Even when it comes to countries like Japan which is praised for it's supposedly collective mask use and stereotyped as "muh respectful culture" or some shit where they didn't have to lock down because everyone is "more behaved" (or whatever fucking dumb shit people believe) mask use was in reality only like 30% on average. Japan's success is not attributed to mask use or "voluntary collectivism" or any bullshit like that as mask use was never a majority there, it's more along the lines East Asian countries already dealt with SARS and allowed their citizens to build herd immunity. (Sorry for this paragraph being longer, I am just sick of the BS Japan stereotype I see thrown around in COVID spaces a lot).</p>
<p>Mask use will never be a majority, for the simple fact people hate them. The only way you will get a majority to wear them is if you either force or socially bully people into it. And at that point your motivations for desiring majority mask use reach beyond just slowing COVID, especially if you try to do things like offer it as "a way out" of lockdowns to people hurt by them.</p>

        <p>So incredibly well said, especially on Japan. I've legit seen people claim, including at /r/lockdownskepticism, that all Japanese wear masks "all the time", and they love it. Uh, no, they do not. Japan mostly wears masks for allergies, and maybe during the flu season, but not everyone does, and it's not mandatory in the least (socially or legally).</p>

        <p>As an anthropology nerd with a great respect for other cultures, but also a simple little human with flaws and biases....the East Asian "respect" thing seems vastly overblown or at least misunderstood by Westerners. And collectivism, even if voluntary, is not necessarily a good thing. I wonder how much of the praise for Asian responses to the virus - many of these responses quite draconian and I'm not just talking about China - is coming from Japanophiles, Sinophiles, Koreaphiles, and the like. Or possibly the opposite, people who couldn't point to those nations on a map.</p>

        <p>They're pushing towards communism/socialism. The goals are also to destroy liberty, property rights, religion, and the family. They may not know it themselves, but that's what their leaders want.</p>

<p>Do you have any evidence for this? I'm looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002%E2%80%932004_SARS_outbreak">wiki</a> page and it says there were around 8000 cases worldwide (edit: and no confirmed cases in Japan). I know that's probably an underestimate, but still it doesn't seem like it was anywhere near widespread enough to reach herd immunity.</p>

        <p>You're not wrong, and I actually appreciate that you pointed it out. I think the community has a handle on it though. Only thing I can recommend is that we all remain vigilant. When you encounter this, check the commenter's post history. Bots and shills can usually be easily identified.</p>
<p>Censoring of dissenting opinions is a huge issue, so we should be mindful of remaining open, honest and transparent in both ways (welcoming criticism of our own views, let the truth prevail).  This sub has helped preserve my sanity.</p>

        <p>No I definitely agree, the concern is well justified. They have a handle on it so far here, but I'm not dismissing your point at all, it's totally valid. I just don't know what the answer is. Some awareness certainly doesn't hurt.</p>
<p>The track record of online communities such as these succumbing to targeted attacks or just being overrun / turning into echo chambers and the like, is not good at all. There are armies of paid social media manipulators out there. This place would undoubtedly come under fire at a certain point.</p>

        <p>I actually don't mind these types of posts bc I think some of them are legitimate people who are concerned about where the virus is going.  As much as we like to be skeptical, there still is a part of me that sees headlines and freaks out! there's nothing wrong with questioning why you believe in something when you are constantly viewing articles and hearing the opposite.   I think the posts add good dialogue and they help answer questions for some people who are unsure still.  I too was nervous about the headlines yesterday so I'm  glad people posted about them and my questions were answered</p>

        <p>I agree that it’s important for our views to be challenged lest we become a delusional echo chamber. We need to respond to the latest pro lockdown arguments with the evidence we have. Sometimes we need to readjust our views.</p>

        <p>This is probably intentional. The mods are approving these so that they can be ripped to shreds by users and showcase anti-lockdown arguments. The sub was becoming a bit echo-chamberish, so I guess this is their way of combating that. </p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if some of those throwaways belonged to a moderator posing as a concern troll.</p>

<p>It woke a lot of people up to the truth, and will keep on waking people up until tyranny loses and we the people win our freedom and rights back without accepting social distancing, forced vaccines and cashless society's.

        <p>We've always accepted a range of views on r/LockdownSkepticism. See our rule 2:</p>
<p>&rt;Abstain from insults and personal attacks. Whether anti-lockdown, pro-lockdown, or somewhere in between, you are free to join the conversation so long as you do so respectfully.</p>
<p>I can't see that changing that except as a temporary measure if we get brigaded by some pro-lockdown sub.</p>
<p>The community grew because those with anti-lockdown views couldn't be heard in most other subs. We know what it's like to be ignored and shouted down for holding a contrarian position. We would be no better if we did the same to those with pro-lockdown views who engage us respectfully.</p>

        <p>I understand that, but can’t deny there has been some concern trolling going on there lately. Not saying they should be censored, in fact I like seeing them get torn apart, but can’t deny that doomers are starting to catch wind of us and have been pulling manipulative attempts to convert us.</p>
<p>I still say let em come, but I’m just asking others if they’ve noticed an increase in people coming to concern troll. Fortunately the community is smart enough to see through it and deals with it on its own and I’m not asking the moderators to do anything about it, I’m just saying it’s happening.</p>

        <p>Yo. I am the OP of the first link, the one talking about plateaued deaths. I didn't think that would be considered "concern trolling". If you look through my posting history you'll see I am a fully anti-lockdown, no compromises and no bullshit person. I am also a medical student who has been following this virus for a very long time now and have almost 50 saved links with information regarding it that interests me. A few things: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How is my posted link concern trolling?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I posted that link there because I read through it, found it interesting and deemed it good enough to post there for discussion. I do believe that for most of Europe, the worst is over and even if they completely open up they're not going to have major putbreaks like they did in March with thousands of people dying. I'm not gonna get into the details of why here, I have posted very lengthy comments with sources and everything in the past you can check them out if you wish.</p>

        <p>First one is written by one of the moderators at r/DebunkedNews. I believe he was the original creator of the sub. It does feel very much like concern trolling, but the OP seemed to be anti-lockdown based on what I’ve seen him post previously. So I’m not quite sure on that one. </p>
<p>Second one feels like straight up concern trolling. I don’t think I’ve seen that account posting much in the anti-lockdown community before. </p>
<p>Third one, with the pro-mask guy working on his PhD, seems legit: I’m pretty sure that guy was posting a month or so ago under some account called Immuno Guy PhD (or something similar) which is now deleted. He had the same viewpoint, super pissed about the lockdowns but really in favor of masks for some reason. I strongly disagree with him about masks, but I do not think that he is trolling. Or if he is, he’s pretty dedicated because I’ve seen him post similar things under different accounts for a while. </p>
<p>I really do believe that the pro-lockdown movement is losing steam. Especially with this week I’ve spent in coastal southern California and seeing about the same low percentage of mask-wearers as I do in Utah, but with even more people out. So I think that the concern trolling is mainly doomers getting frustrated. They are trying to stay on their ship as it sinks. I’ve been talking with my dad (who is also anti-lockdown) and he believes that we will never lock down again. I hope he’s right.</p>

        <p>My state’s governor has ridiculous restrictions even for the final phase of reopening, and even he said a few weeks ago that we will not be shutting down again.</p>
<p>Now if only he’d actually lift restrictions at some rational point instead of saying “new normal” and “restrictions until a vaccine.”</p>
<p>I sort of agree that the pro lockdown crowd is losing steam. I watch the news every morning, and they did lead off with “cases surging” and “alarming increase,” but even with them, it was their top story for a few minutes and then they moved on to talking about confederate statues coming down. And they even covered the story about the Great Clips that avoided a huge outbreak.</p>

<p>What ISN'T it behind. The medical industrial complex is so corrupt it will make the prison system look like Disneyland. Remember we give these people permission to put drugs and knives into our bodies. </p>
<p>With that kind of trust and power, they can and will do anything. Next thing you know they will have an article addressing "anti-lockdown" people as a particular group, perhaps not alt-right as previously propagated but they will cherry pick comments and tweets to marginalize and gaslight them. </p>
<p>One of the current narratives is that lockdown skeptics "dont think black lives matters", since black grandma is "disproportionally dying of covid". Next year expect to become an antisemite</p>

        <p>The md/PhD guy makes some really succinct and impressive lockdown skepticism points though. It’s hard to fault that. </p>
<p>Even if it is a troll I’d actually put it in the “mission accomplished” category: https://xkcd.com/810/</p>
<p>&rt; I believe poor/minority kids going another year of "online" K-12, on its own, is worse than even 1 million early deaths of the elderly.</p>
<p>&rt; I believe when you take away people's ability to see friends and family, they turn to drugs, alcohol, or even social media to fill the void in their lives in unhealthy ways.</p>
<p>&rt;  I believe when you close gyms and public spaces and cover the country/world with a blanket of anxiety, people gain weight and worsen the obesity epidemic, arguably to a far larger loss of life than the worst of COVID-19 over the next 50 years.</p>
<p>&rt;  I believe that putting people out of work is not a harmless act, even if it doesn't directly lead to death.</p>
<p>&rt;  I believe delaying tens of millions of retirements will decrease the life-spans of baby boomers and the future earnings of the millenials and gen Xers who would have taken their positions (thus delaying their retirements).</p>
<p>&rt;  I believe the projections are wrong, and the epidemiologists are redeeming themselves by citing their own incorrect "worst case scenarios," and that voluntary measures are likely driving the majority of our recovery.</p>
<p>&rt;  I believe that delaying things like academic research is extremely harmful to worldwide R&amp;D.</p>
<p>&rt;  I believe that giving everyone the ability to decide their own level of risk tolerance through informed consent and financial support of those in the highest risk categories should be the primary goal, not outright minimizing deaths.</p>

        <p>Part of concern trolling is making yourself look like you are on the side you are attempting to influence. Could have just done his research. Like, the fact he is using a throwaway doesn't really speak well to me, I always approach throwaways with extreme caution. He also seems to be trying to convince us to embrace the "new normal" in exchange for being able to exit lockdowns, it seems.... fishy.... to me.</p>

        <p>I agree the use of a throwaway is highly suspect, and I believe it likely was the same person that posted other threads you mentioned above but the OP presented a well thought out well written argument that I thought was worthy of debate.

        <p>Yeah I think I’d trust him and his credentials a lot more if he was posting on a main account with a lot of history that supports his legitimacy. If someone is using a throwaway or is changing accounts all the time it makes me suspect. </p>
<p>I will say I appreciate that his thread did persuade many of the posters over on the other sub to present their best arguments to debunk it, many of them being very good, even if I do think the OP is a bit concern trolly.</p>

        <p>Medveledium34, he's the soup nazi in lockdown skepticism and I outed him...

<p>Basically he got demoted or got told to pump his brakes with his delete frenzy. Since then it's been back to normal, you can post about exposing the interest behind the lockdown, but likely won't get approved as a thread</p>

        <p>I can't believe that the Tony Blair Institutes' role in the lockdown and "new normal" hasn't been exposed. It's kind of important: an evil war criminal with the blood of a million+ innocents on his hands is embedded in governments and coordinating lockdowns worldwide. Why won't r/lockdownskepticism approve primary source posts on this ugly fact? There are plenty of fluff posts over there, why can't we discuss the overall agenda and the people behind it?</p>

        <p>Regarding the PhD candidate, there’s power in mask-wearing. People can hide/avoid others better, bad teeth are hidden, pressure to smile is gone. It’s a defense mechanism for the socially-anxious and facially-insecure. At the same time, attractive people are more hidden too. People with great smiles are knocked down a peg. Masks are equalizing. It’s a highly-visible symbol of moral virtue and collective compassion. People pollute, consume, compete, get jealous/envious, cheat, deceive, slack, etc, but saving lives through mask-wearing makes makes them better. They’re saving lives, cosplaying surgeons, taking moral high ground and showing they care. I won’t wear one, but can totally understand why so many people have formed such visceral attachments to them.</p>

        <p>Your comment made me cringe at first, but I get it. I won't wear a mask either, but there have been days I wanted to wear my black bandana, if only to look like a robber in a supermarket while I can get away with it. Or because I just don't feel pretty that day. But I won't do it, even if I want to. Solidarity with those who aren't afraid to show their face is a tad more important that hiding a spot on my chin.</p>

        <p>I won’t wear one because in order for it to be effective, it has to be tight, you can’t ever touch or fidget it, or loosely store it in your bag or pocket, and you have to wash your hands for 20 seconds before touching it to put it on and take it off, and you have to wash or dispose of it and get a new one after every use, otherwise it just becomes another vector for spreading germs. All I can see when I see people wearing them is they’re breathing air at me through a crusty curtain of halitosis and finger grime.</p>

        <p>Haha that's pretty much what I do. Tied my black bandana around my face loose enough to pull over my cranium without untying it, and I wear it around my neck, fidget with it, maybe wear it over my face for a brief moment, fold it up or wad it up in my pocket, do not rinse, repeat maybe once a week or so. I keep the bandana on my person because my state has a mask mandate, but I rarely use it because few businesses are actually enforcing it. The people who do wear a mask aren't much more hygienic or careful than I am.</p>

        <p>The sub isn't what it used to be. People overall are much less informed. There are way more people who support lockdown in some form but just think it's 'gone on too long', when the evidence says that a lockdown in any form was wrong.  Too many posts about cases 'spiking' when the case stats have always been complete meaningless bullshit. At the start I might have tried to counter that but it feels like way too much effort playing whack-a-mole with those types of comments. </p>
<p>Don't know if the sub is being compromised by shills/bots or whether it's just half-awake sheep.  The arguments are getting watered down to wishy washy 'compromise' positions when there is no justification for compromise, compromise in this case is dangerous as it's letting insanity win a partial victory.  Overall, still better than anywhere else though and still quite a few genuine good commenters.</p>

        <p>This one of my problems as well. There's way too many people there who support the lockdown, and I've even seen some who say they don't mind doing it again "just not for too long". They've said it would've been fine for two weeks back in March, even though there is still no evidence it was ever necessary (and let's not kid ourselves, if the virus had been deadly, it would not take two weeks to "fix" the problem anyhow). I also see disturbing support for the "New Normal", with folks saying they'd be fine with re-opening, and keeping masks and social distancing as permanent facets of life until a vaccine. </p>
<p>Another problem I have there is the denial of how afraid people are, it seems most at the sub believe it's only a tiny minority that's afraid of the virus while the rest of the world is fed up. I really don't believe so. It really feels like the opposite to me, our kind is in the minority while the fearful masses prevail. </p>
<p>And yeah, like someone else here pointed out at another post, there's never any talk allowed about the possible agendas behind the lockdown and the "New Normal". I get that it's conspiracy theory territory, but this entire situation has been bizarre, and the constant push for more lockdowns recently plus more talk of the "New Normal" has to be sounding alarm bells in people's heads...right?</p>

        <p>I'm with you, loads of people I meet out in the streets dodge me as I walk by without a mask. My friends and family are still afraid of the virus as well. People  also don't seem to be as open to speaking waiting in lines as they did before the pandemic, even if they're wearing masks. There is just something so creepy and off-putting about masks that makes people not want to interact with one another. I think it's because of how they hide facial expressions. </p>
<p>I also agree with you that there definitely seem to be political or governmental reasons behind extended lockdowns...definitely has alarm bells going off in my head.</p>

        <p>I actually am pretty okay with the concern trolling over there. As other people in this thread have said, I feel like some of the "concern trolls" are people who genuinely have questions about the anti-lockdown stance and want to know more about their reasoning for the stances they hold. Also, /r/LockdownSkepticism was starting to get a little echo-chambery, as /u/ZoobyZobbyBanana pointed out. This is good for getting some healthy debate in and I think the users are very open to listening to opposing viewpoints without downvoting, which says a lot about the sub.</p>

        <p>I honestly love that sub, the moderation is great. For example, I don’t mind conspiracy theories and enjoy reading them sometimes but I agree with the mods that it isn’t really the place for them - too much conspiracy stuff all over the place could drive people away who are just starting to question the lockdown narrative. Same with allowing the dissenting opinions, if all of those were banned it would just cause those same “middle of the road” people to get frustrated and leave instead of engaging in debate.</p>
