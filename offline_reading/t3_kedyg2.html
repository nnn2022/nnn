    <strong>Is it fear, ignorance, narcissism? What causes herd mentality.</strong>
    <p><p>I got in a very extensive debate over this with a friend. We both believe that these restrictions are out of control but he doesn't get as enraged at it as I do. Why? Because he believes that these people who lose it in stores over others not wearing their masks are acting out of fear. On one hand I tend to agree, but for these people being so fearful, they have no issue approaching the person without the mask - who they deem a threat. Wouldn't you want to stay further away? I don't know.</p>
<p>Simply put - there seems to be an overwhelming sense of confidence in those that become combative towards non-maskers, and it really doesn't seem accurate to say it's from just being terrified.</p>
<p>Here's an example - I am a 5'10 guy, not lanky and average weight. I look quite young (Early 20's). I had no mask on because I'd just had a rhinoplasty. $8,000 in cash to correct my breathing and crooked nose. I went into a store with no mask because my nose was very sensitive. A few days of recovery and the mask goes back on, no big deal.</p>
<p>Well, this one older woman goes "You know, you should REALLY be wearing a mask". I put my finger to my nose and pointed to the stitches "Yep, I will right when I am done recovery. A few more days, I just had a surgery". This woman and a few people in line lay into me. One man told me that I am a killer and that I am killing people. These people were not afraid of me or the virus. In my opinion they had been waiting for a time to exert their vigilance.</p>
<p>What do you think.</p></p>

<p>They are not thinking straight, something that is caused by fear. It weirds me out how people here don't seem to grasp this very simple concept. For example, people, in their panic while drowning, have pulled under and killed others who come in to try to save them or pull them out from the water. Illogical, right? Well, the fear and panic is preventing them from going "Gee, maybe I should just stay as still as possible while this life guard pulls me ashore". Another example is when people run away from bears. A wildlife expert who had knowledge on how to handle bears ran from a black bear, which is a big no-no.</p>

        <p>I think at this point it is less about fear and hysteria but people literally obey because it's "mandated" it's "the law" and "everyone else is wearing one" and generally the extreme social pressure, it's becoming the equivalent to going out in public without a shirt in some places. There is also definitely a virtue signaling element as well similar to people putting out American flags after 9/11.</p>

        <p>Some people believe every word of it and more around here just comply with a shoulder shrug even if they know it's wrong. I tend to be unbothered in many places, got kicked out of one place but only really ganged up on in another before I was (Target, surprising isn't it?). And in one more I was told to and pushed around a bit but stood my ground and said no you don't get to tell me what to put on or in my body and after another discussion on policy I was left alone rather quickly and just told to finish up faster. </p>
<p>A lot of varied reactions here but in all cases even where the person gave up because I wouldn't and left me alone which he did after I told him it was not store policy as they did at the same time everyone else did meaning that it was done out of outside threats and mandated in store disguised as policy (this is how they get away with shaving away human rights in public and publicly accessible places through loopholes like this). It's not the same thing as a place opening that requires everyone to wear a santa hat for example on their own because it was done out the stores own interests. There was nothing to say back where I was left alone because they knew it was true. If it escalated further it would only be pointless aggression. Where they couldn't be convinced otherwise they didn't offer any arguments back and kept repeating "you need to do this" over and over again (no lie there was nothing else they could say) and the anger from them right off the bat was interesting. There was no consideration or analysis of the situation, they just saw and swarmed in like a bunch of wasps that sensed an invader in the hive.  I also have some people I know that are so afraid they barely leave to go anywhere at all anymore and follow the news like a lost puppy, of course these people you never see out much obviously and if you do they certainly aren't interacting with people much never mind confronting anyone. </p>
<p>There seems to be 3 types of people. One is the fear driven folks I talked about just above there that follow everything blindly but don't really have that fanatical worship of it going on, they just super vulnerable to fear and mainstream sources know how to get at it. The second seems to be the people who know there is nothing valid about anything they are following but do so out of a different kind of fear that they might lose their reputation or their job. Then you have the third group that many big name stores in the most compliant places seem to be purposely arming themselves with. They not only follow the narrative but worship it, the word of the mainstream news, their political party, and state is the word of god to them and no matter how little sense it makes they get their power through being one with that group. The volume of each is going to vary by area but this is what it boils down to in my experiences and the third are the most dangerously useful to what is behind something like this. The others seem to be just the bystanders that accidentally fall into the situation and more indirectly make things worse (mostly the second though as the first just doesn't interact much at all and it wasn't one thing it would have been another they were paranoid about).</p>

        <p>It's the perception of power over others - to behave in shitty ways because you believe you have the sanction and cover of hiding in a group.</p>
<p>People will always "punch down" - as in attack those they perceive to be farther down on the pecking order than themselves.</p>
<p>They will, in turn, lick the boots of those they perceive to be "above" them - looking for approval and whatever scraps they think they can gain.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Boss yells at man------------&rt; Man goes home and slaps wife-------------&rt; wife smacks kid ----------&rt; kid whacks dog -----------&rt; dog chases cat ---------&rt; cat pisses on man's shoes</p>

        <p>I've been thinking a lot about this, too. I would say it's mostly due to the enormous amount of cultural and societal pressure. There are two camps of people I've run into who are adamant about masks.</p>
<ol>
<li>The ones who watch/listen/read the news 24/7. They will constantly shower you with propaganda bits and scary numbers.</li>
<li>The ones who only use social media and who normally have no clue what is happening in the world. I've met people in the US who don't realize that not all states have the same mandates. They don't realize different states took different responses. They have no clue about what is happening politically, other than what they read in memes. Yet, most of these people will still get mad at you for not following mask mandates, because it's about "caring."</li>
</ol>
<p>There have been massive hysterical movements throughout history. Not all hysteria requires social media or constant propaganda. However, I think the current hysteria was created from news and social media, which changed cultural values/views seemingly overnight. Culture is its own police force. Fortunately, we haven't burned anyone at the stake yet.</p>
