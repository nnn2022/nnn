    <strong>The ‘Potential’</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m wondering about these high-risk people; you know, the ones that if I don’t curtail living I apparently don’t care about... has anyone asked them how they feel about these measures? </p>
<p>I can’t imagine that many grandmas and grandpas with chronic if not debilitating or terminal conditions who have already lived a long, full life are out there saying to imprison the world indefinitely and irreparably change the whole ethos of human interaction so they can barely survive for 6 more months, rather than let life go on... have there been any media pieces on that?</p></p>

        <p>Just like it was 'cool' for the millenials to say they have depression or anxiety and are on meds, now the pussies get the woke points for calling themselves 'high-risk'</p>

        <p>Clearly the tin-pot dictator governors who ordered nursing homes, which house concentrations of high-risk people, to accept CV-19 patients, didn't care about them being alive. </p>
<p>This was simultaneous with them ordering healthy people to stay at home and shutting down nonessential business, wrecking economies and livelihoods because the virus was SO easily transmissible and DANGEROUS- so ignorance was not an excuse.</p>

        <p>Right, we know the government never cared about them.</p>
<p>In certain financial service industries there’s a 30-year old problem actuaries couldn’t solve: the aging. (Is your country’s social security/national insurance fund ‘empty’, by any chance?) There’s a massive debt owed to a large set of people who have to be paid until they die, and because of advancements in knowledge, medicine and living conditions they keep living longer. One ‘solution’ was to raise the retirement age, then to raise it again, making them work more years and receive payments for fewer years (way to care). The 2008 crash also wiped out a lot of that debt iirc. I don’t think putting sick people in the homes with highly vulnerable elders was accidental or unplanned. </p>
<p>But what are the elders saying for themselves?</p>

        <p>&rt; I don’t think putting sick people in the homes with highly vulnerable elders was accidental or unplanned.
&rt; </p>
<p>Agreed... and it swelled the daily death count the fear-mongering "news" media utilized to keep the masses cowering and reluctant to question.</p>
<p>&rt; But what are the elders saying for themselves?</p>
<p>Obviously the dead ones aren't saying very much at all.</p>
<p>The elderly are non more as monolith than any other group- and I'd wager that a good portion of those still with us have bought into the narrative to some degree- perhaps even believing that the very wolves who acted to thin the herd actually care about them.</p>

        <p>Agreed that they as any other group are non-monolithic, however this isn’t how people are treated especially by the media. I meant if anyone asks/asked them their opinions on the matter instead of their vulnerability and welfare being used as a political football by people outside their group.</p>

<p>That's the extent of anyone's value- political pawns for low grade emotional blackmail to equate opposition with heartlessness.</p>
