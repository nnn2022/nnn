    <strong>An interesting take from someone who works in a hospital with the first coronavirus vaccines in England</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all, I just wanted to give my two cents about real life peoples perspective from some people who actually work at a hospital in England. </p>
<p>All front line workers in our hospital has been given the option to have the first vaccine doses no matter the age group although we don't have to.</p>
<p>I won't say which for obvious reasons but our hospital has the first doses to dish out and i thought i would give the opinions of people  I work with about vaccine.</p>
<p>Many opinions i have had is from people that won't have it straight away due the concerns of the potential side effects and some have the concern that they won't be able to travel abroad if they don't have the vaccine.</p>
<p>One nurse said that we should have the vaccine if we want to return back to normal and people who don't have the vaccine should not complain about not having a normal life.</p>
<p>So far I have had no real opinions on why we should have it. We have been told it does not affect your chances of getting it and you can still transmit it to other people if you catch it. All we have been told is that it decreases the severity of the virus, making you less likely to die or get seriously ill from it.</p>
<p>Percentage wise its been about 70% of people won't have it straight away or at all until its been a few months or years, 10% unsure and 20% definitely want it no questions asked.</p>
<p>I wanted to post this to tell people that the concerns of the vaccine arnt just from "anti vaxers" or "neckbeards on reddit" or yourselves who maybe called "crazy" for your opinion</p>
<p>These are concerns from your average person. People who have kids, house, pets, jobs etc...</p>
<p>I am also happy to answer any questions in the comments if anybody has it but I just wanted to share my current experiences with other people in a clinical setting with access to the vaccine</p></p>

        <p>A vaccine that doesnt prevent you from getting sick or spreading the virus, to help you not die from a virus that has above a 99% survival rate. </p>
<p>Makes perfect sense.</p>
