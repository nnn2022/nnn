    <strong>Sick of the new normal? JOIN OUR SERVER!</strong>

<p>Note to mods of r/nonewnormal me as well of a bunch of people who were around this server in it's very infacy (before it had 500 subs) have found a bunch of people to join our server against the new authoritarian normal.. so if this seems like a spammy post, I apologize, just know we're all on the same team here.</p>
<p>We have a relatively small server of people that exchange articles, share ideas, and have become sort of a support group not necessarily against covid but the draconian measures used to fight against it.</p>
<p>Come check us out.. we're always looking for new people.</p>
<p>If this post isn't removed much appreciate to the people who keep this great server running!</p>
