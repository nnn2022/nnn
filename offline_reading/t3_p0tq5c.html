    <strong>They're complaining so much about people NOT trusting the vaccine.. and yet they have done everything they can to make themselves seem suspicious and untrustworthy</strong>
    <p><p>If they are trying to convince any vaccine-skeptic about taking the vaccine, they have pretty much done EVERYTHING wrong, and then have the nerve to say "why are people skeptical about our vaccine? Fucking trump supporters!!" Well, fucking duh? Almost like actions speak louder than words??</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No liability for vaccine manufacturers. Got injured? You're out of luck!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Myocarditis being admitted as a potential risk as late as June 2021... when people have been complaining about heart problems since March 2021. Imagine what we will learn by December 2021, one year since the vaccines were rolled out? December 11, 2020 was when it was granted EUA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NEVER forget the Swine Flu vaccine disaster of 1976, and they stopped distribution of it after a couple of problems... which is a complete joke compared to the problems the COVID vaccine has already caused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDC reports 99.5% survival rate (covid, not the vaccine), even for the elderly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long Covid" (which is already very vague to begin with), multiple studies show that its nowhere near as common as initially believed, and some "Long Covid" cases are NOT unique to covid alone <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/scientists-havent-figured-out-long-covid-here-are-5-of-their-best-hypotheses/ar-BB1fDLyR">source here</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-58071898">here, long lasting symptoms are rare in children</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconsistencies with data collection (even CNN has criticized the CDC for their lousy data: https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/health/breakthrough-cases-cdc-analysis/index.html)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apparently it doesn't prevent infection or the spread of infection. Can still get sick (albeit a bit lesser?) What the fuck is the point of a vaccine passport then, aside from segregation? Even without the vaccine your chances of survival is incredibly high already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fact checkers have a $2 billion dollar stake in the vaccine manufacturers company. (Conflict of interest)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pfizer board member is also CEO of Reuters (fact checking site). Of course they won't talk shit about themselves, so there's definitely bias in the "Fact checking" articles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>India suing WHO and ivermectin saved India.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VAERS data for vaccine injuries, particularly for women.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes in PCR counts (wtf?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robert Malone being silenced and discredited despite contributing to mRNA in the past, warnings being ignored</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter McCullough and a whole lotta other scientists being silenced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four countries refused COVID vaccines. <strong>Disturbingly, all four leaders have been found dead</strong>, unexpectedly. Most notably, in Haiti. Haiti’s leader was assassinated in his home. Then, two days later, Biden administration announced they’ll be bringing vaccines to Haiti.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cuba protesting against communism and the US media changing the narrative to say they’re protesting about lack of vaccines. Outright LYING.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, instead of comforting any skeptics, they instead bribe with "free food" or scholarships, as if any anti-vaxxer gives a shit about that, or outright hostility.</p>
<p>"W-why are they so skeptical" /s</p></p>

        <p>I was thinking this earlier.</p>
<p>Like that autopsy video that's pinned. I have no idea how genuine it is. It looks genuine! Guy seems like he should know his stuff. Why wouldn't I believe him?</p>
<p>If he's wrong, I'd like to know why.</p>
<p>But the only counter-argument I hear is "trust me, he's lying. stop getting misinformation off Facebook and take the damn shot. you're the reason we're still in this."</p>
<p>It's the opposite of reassuring. It's frankly abusive.</p>

        <p>Just seen the video you mean, I think. Seems true to me aswell.</p>
<p>Also the biggest problem is I can tell how (not)dangerous the covid is by the low mortality rate.</p>
<p>I have no clue how much the vaccine is dangerous. </p>
<p>Why would you choose potentially bigger unknown danger ove small known one?</p>

        <p>Oh, but we don’t yet know the long term effects of Covid, so you should inject this newly utilized emergency approved substance purposely into your body just in case. No, no, definitely no long term side effects from this though. In fact, it only even stays in your body for a short time, so we can look forward to constantly injecting more over time thereby increasing the odds of injury from this miracle “vaccine”.</p>

        <p>They ignore our concerns like we are crackpot conspiracy theorists, until the evidence is so overwhelming, that they cannot ignore it any longer.  They have completely ignored the risks the poison poses to people.  While saying it is safe and effective.  They have completely discounted naturally acquired immunity and have not allowed therapeutics.  This is a coordinated effort to conduct the largest medical experiment on humanity.</p>

        <p>Yes. Google "Swine flu pandemic 1976 vaccine injuries"</p>
<p>This was the first one:</p>
<p>"After the program began, the vaccine was associated with an increase in reports of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, which can cause paralysis, respiratory arrest, and death. <strong>The immunization program was ended after approximately 25% of the population of the United States had been administered the vaccine."</strong></p>
<p>I'm not talking about the swine flu pandemic in 2009.</p>

        <p>Interesting. Will look into that. Back in 09 i got swine flu and then i also got vaxed because adults told me i had to. They were able to whip that vaccine in 3 months which seems suspicious to me bow looking back.</p>
