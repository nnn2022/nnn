    <strong>Vaccine and Antibody Dependent Enhancement</strong>
    <p><p>This is from BC, Canada immunization website. Can anyone comment on this?</p>
<p>Do the mRNA vaccines cause Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) with COVID-19 disease?</p>
<p>Answer:Â </p>
<p>ADE  is when a disease is made worse or more severe in a person who was  already exposed to the virus through a previous infection or vaccination  compared to people who were never exposed or vaccinated.</p>
<p>Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has not been identified as a  concern related to SARS-CoV-2 infection or following COVID-19  vaccination. <a href="https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/making-vaccines/prevent-covid">Here</a> are reasons indicating why ADE will not be a concern:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, most people have been infected with other coronaviruses in  their lifetime, and ADE has not been identified as a result of these  infections.</li>
<li>Second, in human studies, people previously infected with coronavirus  were infected with different types of coronavirus, and they did not  experience enhanced disease.</li>
<li>Third, experimental animals vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 did not  develop enhanced disease when challenged, or infected, with the virus.</li>
<li>Finally, when people with COVID-19 received plasma containing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, they did not experience enhanced disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, ADE is not expected to be a concern for SARS-CoV-2 infections or vaccination.</p>
