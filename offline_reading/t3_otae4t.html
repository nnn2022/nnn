    <strong>Why are they giving out empty shots instead of saline water?</strong>
    <p><p>If you watch youtube you see more and more recordings of people getting vaccinated with nothing injected. Pretty much just poke the needle and pull it out with nothing injected. Why dont they use saline water instead since people are recording the process?</p>
<p>I understand health authorities are doing so to give placebo shots, so that should there be serious issues with the vaccine, at least few % of the population getting the placebo shot may survive.</p>
<p>And since there is no real way to verify if a person is vaccinated or not apart from a record, you would not be able to tell if you got a legit shot. Even with zero antibodies detected, it will be counted as a non reactive case.</p>
<p>So why are they still encouraging people to get vaccinated? Because they still need over 60% vaccination rate to achieve herd immunity.</p>
<p>Empty jabs getting exposed, authorities swear to look into this matter, but still we see more cases about it, folks aint dumb enough to do this so they can resell the vaccines in the black market after getting exposed and when people are doing a selfie, so these operators must be following directives from the top to give certain % of people a placebo shot.</p></p>

        <p>Good ole John Hopkins didn’t even actually get the jab. They literally poked his ass then pulled it out and didn’t push the plunger. Tis all a farce, some could have gotten a mixed bag, some could have gotten saline, some could have gotten nothing at all. They need a control group right?</p>

        <p>I’d be willing to bet they know exactly what was in each vial and where it went. I remember back in 2019 the DOD dropped a fuck load of money on syringes with “rfid tags on them.” I think they know.</p>

        <p>i don't know. from what i see, it's usually jab and go, you snap a QR code on the wall or something, there is probably a tag based on the batches instead of individual syringe or vials (what is the purpose of having tags on empty syringes). What i am guessing is the same person will give genuine shots and also placebo shots, so how do they determine which person gets the genuine shots? Maybe they go by alternate bottles, once the vial is finished the next few guys get the placebo, then a new vial?</p>
<p>But what about walk ins? People would go in by random so it would be difficult to plan who gets what.</p>
<p>Or maybe they have certain criteria, young and healthy gets the placebo, people that went alone gets the placebo as they are less weary of what is going on, older people get the genuine vaccine, since if there is any long term effect it wouldn't be a long stretch as younger people (which would end up stressing the medical system in years/decades to come).</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure there is a system to determine who gets what. I'm guessing it is around the ballpark figure of 30% for placebo shots.</p>

        <p>I can't speak on most of this... but herd immunity has absolutely nothing to do with vaccines. The definition was changed during lockdowns last year to make people think vaccines are necessary for it. Herd immunity can only be reached when the population has been exposed and can no longer get it because there are enough people with antibodies to not spread it anymore.</p>

        <p>I googled about placebo shots since someone here mentioned about mixing saline shots and placebo shots so different groups get contaminated shots while others get vaccine shots which explains why some people get the side effects worse than others.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about it but some how just realized its probably because they knew about the side effects and decided that certain groups get the real slim shady.</p>
<p>But yea seems most of this happened in poorer nations. Maybe they just want to smuggle the vaccine out? But how dumb can they be to do so when people are recording which made me suspect they are under instructions from higher ups.</p>
<p>But didnt that uk minister took an empty jab infront of tv half a year ago?</p>

        <p>Yea like how could they mix up saline water with air?</p>
<p>I wonder if they keep track who has the real jab and who gets the placebo.</p>
<p>Also is there some criteria in determining who gets the placebo?</p>
<p>Imo they would give the older people the real jab but younger healthy ones would be subject to a placebo so society can still have survivors in their prime if the vaccine went bad.</p>
<p>They would still need to keep track of the placebo shot if they were to continue with the booster shots to keep a group of people unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>I think the terminology being used is confusing - it's not that the needle had <em>nothing</em> in it, it just didn't have any of the mystery mRNA juice.  They have to dilute the vaccine with saline prior to injection - the needles in this case, only had the saline. But, that's still weird, because it's not like you mix the two in the needle....you put the saline in the vial, mix, then pull out the dose.  </p>
<p>Page 3 goes over how to dilute, mix and inject.</p>
