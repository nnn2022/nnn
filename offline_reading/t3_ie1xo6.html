<title>Is the flu vaccine, with a less than 50% effectiveness rate average (both overall and the 18-49 age group rate), already being pushed right before they release the COVID-19 vaccine?</title>

        <p>SS: Did some research on this graphic so I wasn't posting an image without any context!</p>
<p>The title of the CDC report (with 2 tables) attached is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6907a1.htm"><strong>Interim Estimates of 2019-20 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This is what they explain regarding the <strong>flu vaccine effectiveness</strong> on the top of the report:</p>
<p>&rt;According to data from the <strong>U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network</strong> on <strong>4,112 children and adults with acute respiratory illness</strong> during October 23, 2019–January 25, 2020, the overall estimated effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was <strong>45%</strong>.</p>
<p>Less than half of effectiveness rate from the flu vaccine? Things that make you go hmm...</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6907a1.htm#T2_down">same CDC link as above except this one scrolls down to <strong>Table 2</strong></a> which is labelled as:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>TABLE 2.</strong> Number and percentage of outpatients with acute respiratory illness and cough (N = 4,112) receiving 2019–20 seasonal influenza vaccine, by influenza real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result status, age group, and vaccine effectiveness<em> against all influenza A and B, B/Victoria and A(H1N1)pdm09 — U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network, </em><em>October 23, 2019–January 25, 2020</em>*</p>
<p>Table 2 aligns with <a href="https://youtu.be/sszziBtrjI8">February 2020 ACIP Meeting on Influenza Vaccines</a> on YouTube that is used as the source, "CDC's Feb 25, 2020 ACIP Meeting", of the posted graphic (originally posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/BodyAutonomy">@BodyAutonomy on Twitter</a>).</p>
<p>Important Time Stamps from the meeting discussing Table 2 from the CDC report: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/sszziBtrjI8?t=2416">40:16</a> - Beginning of <strong>Table 2</strong> discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/sszziBtrjI8?t=2440">40:40</a> - “The overall vaccine effectiveness at this interim estimate is 45%.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/sszziBtrjI8?t=2453">40:53</a> - “The estimates for <strong>18 to 49-year-olds are 25%</strong> (vaccine effectiveness).”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The effectiveness rate of 18 to 49-year-olds is a quarter of a whole? More things that make you go hmm...</p>
<p>I'll end this post off with a new article titled <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/08/19/flu-vaccine-massachusetts-students-shot-requirement/">Flu Vaccine Now Required For All Massachusetts Students By Dec. 31</a> (August 19, 2020). This requirement in MA applies to those enrolled in Child Care, Pre-School, K-12, and Post-Secondary Institutions. </p>
<p>Notice the requirement of the flu vaccine all of sudden for these many different institutions, even with the effectiveness rates of the flu vaccine being less than half. </p>
<p>You provaxxers do absolutely no research. All you do is hop on r/vaxxhappened and call out others on your pure lack of research that I just did for your whole worthless community. I challenge any of you provaxxers to come up with a great counterargument against this post.</p>

<p>I don't believe there are two sides to this argument. What you call "provaxxers" is basically the pharma-gov cartel. I wouldn't perceive that as a legit side in a debate.</p>

        <p>This is why I dont get the flu vaccine. Now my doctor wants me to get a pneumonia vaccine, which I've never even heard of. All this on top of a brand new COVID19 vaccine has me confused. Why would I want all three at the same time?</p>

        <p>Pneumonia vaccine has been around for quite a while now, and only works against specific pneumococcal bacteria. There’s actually two varieties, PCV13 and PPSV23, and provides some meningitis protection also. </p>
<p>Not all pneumonia is bacterial though, but many viral will develop into bacterial as you get further immunosuppressed. </p>
<p>If you’re over 65, or have medical issues, you’re doctor will often suggest these. There’s evidence to suggest 50% of COVID-19 related deaths have co-infections, suggesting higher lethality when you’re also affected by the flu, cold and/or pneumonia.</p>
<p>It makes sense to reduce that risk. </p>
<p>That said the standard advice from the CDC is to get PCV13 first, wait a minimum of 8 weeks, then get PPSV23. It is unlikely a coronavirus vaccine will be released in the next 16 weeks. </p>
<p>I don’t think it would necessarily be dangerous to get all 3 at one time but likely hurts effectiveness. I’ve been doing allergy shots for a few years and from my talk with an immunologist &amp; allergist, the immune system can only work at a specific pace — I had to sacrifice cat allergy serum to get better response to pollen, else therapy would take potentially many more years or be overall less effective. </p>
<p>If the same logic applies to vaccines, it would mean your immune system may take longer to gain immunity or some of the strains may never gain proper antibody levels.</p>
<p>Edit: PSV13 may not be needed, as new evidence suggests childhood vaccination for PSV13 has dropped a lot of the potential risk to elderly of picking it up from vectors (mainly children).</p>

        <p>This is interesting, thanks for the info.</p>
<p>I'm not even 30 and my only issue is mild asthma that's very well controlled and not very severe. No other doctor has ever brought it up to me before so I assumed it was new. I have a pretty strong immune system and rarely get sick, like I've only had the flu once and I got it in NYC (petri dish of a city). Definitely will consider this.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t suggest it to an average healthy adult, but rather over age 65, or immunocompromised or with primary health concerns (heart issues, lung issues, etc). It’s not harmful per say but not necessary with childhood schedule these days and limited risk. I’d be more worried about checking your MMR antibodies.</p>
