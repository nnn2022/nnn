    <strong>Losing a friend over my opinion on Covid?</strong>
    <p><p>I will start by saying I work in healthcare research and am pretty well versed. I also have 10+ years of lab experience. I have a friend who has taken the last year as an opportunity to make everyone feel bad for her because of people in her life “who are essential and go to work while everyone sits at home” (including herself)  said”thank God my essential family members are being given first access to the vaccine”. Eventhough she is financially supported, she talks about how much loss she’s suffered as a result of COVID, eventhough she has not lost a thing. When people don’t respond in a group chat, she’ll message on the side “omg I hope so snd so doesn’t have COVID!!!” She has canceled plans with me because she “is being safe about things right now”.. and very recently invited me to an event later in the year &amp; added the caveat that “by that time we’ll all be vaccinated and safe”.. 
I refuse to have this debate with her, so I have been kind of letting it roll off my back, but it’s getting really annoying. Why do people like this almost revel in the shittiness of the past year? It’s like they love being a victim. The one time I mentioned that I didn’t think the vaccine was right for me, and should I be given to ppl at high risk if they want it, she said that “she thought I was someone who believes in science.” I said I do, and I choose not to participate in a clinical trial because I am healthy and have a great immune system therefore it is not necessary for me to dabble in experimental drugs, which the vaccine is.  She wanted to continue to “convince” me, but I cut the conversation off; after that conversation I really can’t stomach her anymore- for as good of a friend as she had been, hearing how ridiculous she is being with all of this I just can’t tolerate her anymore... has anyone else felt like this or have a similar experience with a friendship or relationship just being totally messed up over covid and differing beliefs?</p></p>

        <p>Two types of people I trust lately: Veterans for peace, and medical professionals for vaccine safety.  They know a thing or two, and are willing to stand up for the truth in their respective fields.  </p>
<p>Sorry about your friend.  She has lost her mind.  She thought you were someone who "believes in science."  You need to face the truth - she's disappointed that you don't belong to the cult she's been indoctrinated into.  <em>Belief in science</em> is a religious position.</p>

        <p>Same!!! It’s disgusting and anyone with a basic knowledge of science knows that a mask isn’t preventing a virus. Kids with masks are touching their faces 5000X more than usual..  this is just not helpful  especially on kids who are constantly touching their faces.</p>

        <p>I just can’t Believe people are convinced that this is Ok!!! Like a, these little cloth masks are just gross and ineffective to begin with.. and when you think about the rationale behind masks, it is to prevent people from spreading their own viruses to others.... are we really expecting children to effectively use already useless ppe to prevent virus spread???? Come on.</p>

        <p>I got into a debate with my friends last week about how I do not want to take the  covid vaccine for a few years since we dont know the long term effects. Luckily they were respectful and civil about the disagreement. But theyre being naive about the situation, still believing that this is a highly deadly virus, even though we're in our 20's and very low risk of death.</p>

        <p>Yup. Unfortunately the majority of my friends (all in their 20ies) are scared shitless of catching it. As in, they believe their chance of landing in the ICU is a 50/50 chance or something. They believe all the fear propaganda that is being fed to them by the media. Whenever we talk about how fed up we are with the lockdowns, their standpoint is that we’re still locked up because too many people break the rules and that —- we’d need even stricter lockdowns—- to win this fight. Don’t even get me started on convos about the experimental vaccine. Mind you, these people have master’s degrees and have great careers.</p>
<p>I try to avoid arguing with them because I feel that the damage that the media has done is irreparable at this stage. Their ridiculously faithful trust in our governments is the icing on the cake.</p>
<p>But well..  quite impossible to find more like-minded friends when everything is still locked up. But at the end of the day, they’re still my friends and we manage to bond over other things.</p>

        <p>I am sorry you’re dealing with this too but it’s nice knowing I’m not alone here.  A good Friend of mine who got the vaccine dose 2 actually got SUPER sick snd needed to get an IV because she ran a very high fever and could barely move because of aches and pains. This girl is an RN and told me that she made the wrong choice getting the vaccine and that she’s nervous of what affect  this could have down the line,</p>

        <p>I feel like the ratio of doomers : ‘we’re done with this drama’ ratio in my social circles is 80:20.. so it’s pretty bad and really hope that’s not representative of most people. 
I’m sorry to hear about your friend’s negative experience with the vaccine.. it’s unbelievable what damage the governments and media are creating with their fear mongering.</p>

        <p>It really is frightening how hook, line and sinker people bought into everything. Just casually ignoring all of the misinformation and flip flopping from fauci and "the science." I was having a casual conversation with people at the casino the other day and brought up the fact that 15 or 16 states now have no mask mandate so I may considering moving somewhere that is less restrictive. First thing out of one guy's mouth: "But then you'll be putting people in danger." So I have been spending around an hour or 2 with this guy like 3 feet from me and in his cognitive dissonance he believes that 1. I am a carrier of a deadly disease and if I don't wear a mask I will put people in danger and 2. I am a carrier of a deadly disease 3 feet away from him but he is safe because we are wearing masks...All I can say is wow. Mental gymnastics doesn't do it justice. I think someone up above said braindead...</p>

        <p>Yep, I lost a friend of more than 10 years over my decision not to wear a mask. He kept lecturing me about my responsibility to his health, meanwhile, he’s an overweight binge drinker who’s asthmatic but smokes everyday. The bright side is, although I always used to give him the benefit of the doubt, he was never really treated me well anyway and it was a long time coming. This girl sounds like she doesn’t deserve your friendship either, it’s sad, but you’re probably better off without her.</p>

        <p>Yeah this have definitely helped me see people’s true colors. I hate the self righteous bullshit and how selfish I am for my choices. This is coming from a person who has made decisions in that past that we’re definitely self serving and downright selfish at times!!! Stealing, lying the list goes on. I try to not be a judgmental person and let things roll off but this lately is too damn much</p>

        <p>Sometimes it takes intense situations to see who people really are. We all change, and that means we outgrow people. Your feelings are totally understandable.</p>
<p>I have purged almost all of my friends, and some family members for political and Covid reasons. I just cannot communicate with them anymore. We do not see eye to eye, we fight about it, and it is too draining. </p>
<p>Maybe, "circle back" to this this friend later when/if the pandemic settles down. (J/k)</p>

        <p>I have plenty of friends I have disagreements with, but I feel like this relationship has soured as I described above. My personal health choices should not be up for discussion and a good friend should respect my choices just as I do theirs. This friend has had  several elective surgeries, and eventhough I might not have agreed with those decisions, I brought food over &amp; wished them the best.</p>

        <p>I have friends in public health so you can imagine the kind of indoctrination they’re under. Personally I think if someone is trying to proselytize an experimental vaccine, there’s something very off about that. Whether you decide to stay friends or not, thats a personal decision. One of my closest friends has gotten the vaccine but she understands it’s risky and does not try to convince me. I think the people who are acting like your friend is are revealing a lot about themselves, and I wouldn’t want them in my life. I have a low tolerance for bullshit though. I think at minimum setting your personal boundaries would be useful: I will not be getting this vaccine bc xyz, you will not change my mind, if you cannot let me make my own decision to not join a medical experiment, that’s on you. So maybe making it their decision to not see you? Again just an idea, do what resonates with you.</p>

        <p>Eh, people respond differently to different things.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't know anyone like this but I'd probably ignore someone like this until/if pandemic concerns are adequately addressed in your respective geographic area.</p>
<p>People change all the time, just be clear with them and if the situation is irreconcilable then so be it.</p>

        <p>Yeah I think as long as you can respect each others positions.withoutnneeding to change the other the friendship can survive.</p>
<p>Or in the spirit of her being a good friend in the past, ride it out/minimise harm and hope that this is all settled one day and that it'll no longer be a burning in ones proverbial beaver.</p>

        <p>The only person I know who received the full 2 doses had to get an IV bc they got really ill, horrible aches and pains and high fever for 3 days!!!! It’s been over a week now and she is still not 100%. Meanwhile my husband has covid and he was sick for maybe 2 days, and barely had a 100 fever and was just drowsy and needed rest. It seems that most ppl I know who had covid were sick a few days, and recovered  pretty fast.  Even a family member with emphysema recovered fully in a week. I am
Not saying some ppl didn’t get really sick, but generally speaking, most ppl recovered well that I knew at least. People talk about the unknown long term effects of covid but we REALLY don’t know the long term effects of the vaccine..</p>

        <p>As a person who was basically in a cult for few years of my youth (extreme fundamentalist Christian sect), if your friend is basically intelligent and well intentioned, she will eventually come to her senses, in the meantime see her has someone who has just taken a bad drug and it will take time to metabolize all the residual toxins, but it will happen.</p>

        <p>Ya know... not to sound weird but I think event 201 has forced a sort of dark night of the soul for a lot of people, especially those whose entire system of values revolves around material things. I also think that deep down a lot of people know something isn't right but the thought of governments, media, and corporations all over the world conspiring to lie to them and control them for an unforeseen end is a thought so frightening, so terrifying, that they dare not question anything served to them on the surface level and simply play along because to do otherwise would break their psyche. Especially those who have played along this long without question. The longer they play along the more dangerous the thought of it being a lie is to their minds and souls. So they double and triple down. They advocate the double masks, the vaccines, in hope that they are right and the leaders are benevolent and we are all outrageous conspiracy theorists.</p>

        <p>I had a really great friend, one of my best friends; whom I hadn’t seen in months due to living in different cities for awhile.  The day we were supposed to meet up she texted saying she wanted the whole meet up to be distanced because her roommate told her she had to.  I said fuck that; I’m not meeting up unless we’re normal.  Also was extra pissed off that she values and accommodates her roommate’s hysteria over her actual close friends.  She decided not to meet up over that.  Still haven’t seen her a month later. Honestly it pissed me off so much that I don’t even want this person in my life at all until she apologizes.  There is NO way I’m going to say “OK ok we’ll just have a socially distanced chat.”  Thats so cringe and just wrong.  Anyone else feel like it’s a nightmare when you see friends you know and care about falling for this shit?  It’s almost like they’re joining a cult.</p>

The mutual friend decided that day that she “wasn’t comfortable with non family” being over to the house and even though we had these plans for a week or two, I was pretty much uninvited; my friend was allowed to go Bc she is the godmother of one of her kids 🤦🏻‍♀️(sorry not real family and what’s the difference if it’s family or a friend ??
