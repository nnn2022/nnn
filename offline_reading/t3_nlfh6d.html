    <p><p>As a member of this sub I have noticed something.   Those with an outward thought are not allowed certain places.  I have asked legitimate question in covid based subs which were either immediately deleted or I just simply was not able to because "this sub only accepts posts from trusted accounts"  these places are not there for discussion if you have a question that breaks the narrative you will not be allowed to exist in those places.  The only subs I have seen not engaging in blatant censorship are the subs that cater to creative thought and open mindedness. FFS just because I read another sub my opinions, questions, and ideas are all classified as 'misinformation or conspiricy'<br>
In all honestly it's obvious to all except those doing it,in their mind they are protecting the feeble minded from having to make an informed decision. Ignorance is bliss and they are on cloud 9.</p></p>
