    <strong>Howâ€™s Nashville?</strong>
    <p><p>Good evening folks,</p>
<p>My question is simple. How is Nashville Tennessee? I live in New Mexico, one of the original socialist states of the US that sits between Arizona and Texas. We have been locked down and economically destroyed since the beginning of all this. My gf and I are absolutely exhausted from all of this and need something to do. My brother is moving to Tennessee soon and we want to greet him as he returns from his tour in the military overseas. Are we going to have a decent time in Nashville or should we expect lockdowns? Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>Nashville resident here. Tennessee as a whole is pretty much open, but the governor left restrictions up to each county, so things vary by county here. Our mayor here is pretty bad though and tries to keep an iron grip on downtown, with all the Broadway bars being pressured pretty hard to enforce the citywide mask policy and other random covid nonsense. Once you get away from that area though, people tend to be a lot more lax about masks and social distancing and I was even able to enter and get service at a restaurant further out without a mask at all and no one bothered me about it. All the bars are still forced to close at 10:30 and the bars and restaurants in the high profile/popular areas of downtown are forced to be assholes about masks, but that's about it. It's definitely a whole lot better than what I hear NM has to deal with!</p>
