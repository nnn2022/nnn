    <strong>A good reason to be skeptical about government's "best intentions"...</strong>
    <p><p>I stumbled upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences">wiki page for "unintended consequences"</a> that happened to sum up why I always think it's healthy to be skeptical, specifically in regards to government policies that might seem like an obvious benefit to society.</p>
<p>Basically, it is the crux of why I am concerned all of the NN is more dangerous than the virus itself as it does not seem to have ever been considered by those who support it.</p>
<p>Here is the summary for those who don't want to click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences">the link</a>:</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences">social sciences</a>, <strong>unintended consequences</strong> (sometimes <strong>unanticipated consequences</strong> or <strong>unforeseen consequences</strong>) are outcomes of a purposeful action that are not intended or foreseen. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociologist">sociologist</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Merton">Robert K. Merton</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences#cite_note-nytimes.com-1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Unintended consequences can be grouped into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unexpected benefit</em>: A positive unexpected benefit (also referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luck">luck</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity">serendipity</a> or a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/windfall">windfall</a>).</li>
<li><em>Unexpected drawback</em>: An unexpected detriment occurring in addition to the desired effect of the policy (e.g., while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation">irrigation</a> schemes provide people with water for agriculture, they can increase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterborne_diseases">waterborne diseases</a> that have devastating health effects, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis">schistosomiasis</a>).</li>
<li><em>Perverse result</em>: A perverse effect contrary to what was originally intended (when an intended solution makes a problem worse).</li>
