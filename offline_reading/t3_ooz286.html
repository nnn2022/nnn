    <strong>Is it a storm before the mega storm?</strong>
    <p><p>I have been connecting the dots. And today I had a light bulb moment.</p>
<p>What if? The shots aren't meant to terminate lives but to prime for the next wave release?</p>
<p>So these shots using gene therapy is tweaking the message your natural dna sends by an interfering or altering the Messenger rna that executes what the dna wants to perform.</p>
<p>So what the shots maybe doing is to creating an artificial immune system that is ready for when they release the next virus which will kill many Vaxed.</p>
<p>We all know that they won't vax majority if the vax itself is gonna kill. But rather prime the bodies of the Vaxed to have serious illness when the next virus is released.</p>
<ol>
<li>First we were told that this virus spread because some Chinese blokes ate a sick bat</li>
<li>Then we all know that this virus is a fast spreading virus amongst animals but cannot transmit to humans and it was engineered in labs of Wuhan to do otherwise.</li>
<li>Overwhelming amount of cold body storage and body bags being procured and provisioned by many governments and set standby in warehouses and many other call of contracts set in place for such measures since May 2021.</li>
<li>Drive the vax pass for September so that they can get a final push on the numbers and they know that they can't reach 100% but 80% will do for them.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the mathematicians within us know very well the curve is always transient and its the last few % takes a lot of effort and time.</p>
<p>I think they not only made the c19 but also another version of the V that will lock onto the spike protein as the preferred landing site and attack. It's a freaking protein strand.</p>
<p>You build the runway first and then send the planes to land is the shittest analogy I can think of.</p></p>

        <p>I think op is saying the vax actually makes covid deadly to those who've been vaxxed. As a way to make a targeted virus.</p>
<p>Leaving the politicians (who, in this conjecture, just got saline injections for show) unharmed and the unvaxxed left to be workers. They don't even hide wanting to reduce the population, so I don't know why they wouldn't do something like this.</p>

        <p>So I have a similar theory, but a bit different. Mine is that the govt is pushing for vaccinations and that the vaccines do work (but for a variant or virus that hasn’t been released yet). The sheep, and masses get vaccinated against a virus with a 99% survival rate. Say 75% of the population gets vaccinated against it. Then a virus is released with almost certain chance of death but the covid-19 vaccine prevents it. So the govts were effectively able to cherry pick who lives and who dies. The vaccine-hesitant, anti-Vaxxers, and free thinkers will perish and the vaccinated sheep will survive</p>

        <p>Too many bodybags for the 25% though even if it all happens in one go.</p>
<p>Try get a life insurance or a medical insurance that covers covid vax adverse effects.</p>
<p>8% if human DNA is from viruses that infected our ancestors and I strongly believe those viruses played a huge part in our evolution after we became vertebrae. I'm sure whatever is released in a form of a virus our human bodies are designed to adapt. Because viruses simply inject their dna into our cells and dna multiplies consuming all the resources within the target cell and the burst. Our immune system then responds seeing a foreign body. </p>
<p>However, human body isn't evolved to mitigate MRNA being injected.</p>
<p>The only time MRNA treatment has been used in the past is for cancer patients with aggressive tumours where the mrna basically hinders the cencer cell sending message during a cell cycle and tries to slow it down.</p>
