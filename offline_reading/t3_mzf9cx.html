    <strong>Wow, anti-lockdown pundits are starting to legitimately advocate for Revolution in the West</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.aier.org/article/restitution-for-systemic-covidism/</p>
<p>This is the strongest-worded article from AIER yet! It’s basically arguing for the overthrow of the United States government!</p>
<p>I of course a law-abiding pacifist and would ever support the establishment of a Ron DeSantis America-becomes-Florida monarchy peacefully...</p>
<p>“Arguably, America needs only a few leaders and it certainly doesn’t need the specific ones currently in office.”</p>
<p>“But they are the ones who need to go, before their failed policies become so palpably criminal that Americans decide to strip them of their property, freedom, and perhaps, in a country increasingly devoid of effective police or rule of law, their very lives, in the name of restitution for systemic covidism and other abuses of power and reason.”</p></p>
