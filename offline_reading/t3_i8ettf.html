    <strong>I'm not doing any more fucking Zoom calls</strong>
    <p><p>I admit that I reached my Zoom quota pretty early on; about two weeks after lockdown I began rejecting Zoom happy hours and catchups.</p>
<p>But, my faith is important to me, and my weekly study continued over Zoom, so I abided.</p>
<p>Until today. I'm fucking done. Since it's way too dangerous to have church services (but perfectly safe to protest and riot) we've been watching pre-recorded sermons through Zoom. Someone streams the video from their computer and we all Zoom in and watch together and have a discussion. I'm not sure if it's possible that something can add less than zero value to my life, but if so, Zoom sermons are it. The video lags, so the audio and person speaking are a few frames off, which is maddening to watch. Add in everyone's constant connectivity and audio problems and you have a distracting, annoying, tedious experience that feels like some torturous obligation rather than an uplifting spiritual experience.</p>
<p>I miss church so much. Everyone's all "tHe pEoPlE aRe tHe ChUrcH" but you know what, there is a marked difference between gathering together to sing and worship versus sliding onto the couch in your pajamas to watch a glitchy blurry sermon on your computer.</p>
<p>I told my group today I'm not doing any more Zoom calls. I'll either watch the videos together with others in person or I'll do it on my own time. I think I've stirred the pot but I don't care. If everyone else is too scared to be around others five months into this disaster of public health policy, that's their own problem and I refuse to keep indulging their fears. </p>
<p>Of course, I'm being SO SELFISH and church is not about the building but the people and AKSHUALLY THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT RESTRICTING my freedom to practice my religion because duh Zoom sermonzzz! How about the BLM just riot through Zoom calls? Same thing, no?</p></p>

        <p>I had made the bad assumption early on that regular church goers would be strongly anti-lockdowns since IMO church is built on community and engagement.  Yes there have been flair ups but its been mostly "see you online" signs outside churches around me.</p>
<p>Good on you though!</p>

        <p>Really.  There are some very rightwing Catholics who have gone full lockdown.  It's really sad.</p>

        <p>I'm not surprised by the differences in Catholic ideology when it comes to lockdowns and who supported them and who is against them.</p>
<p>It's mostly the Novus Ordo Catholics (those who support the Vatican II regime's modernist approach) which support the lockdowns and the closure of churches. Vatican II has watered down many of the rites and sacraments and definitely doesn't promote belief in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. So technically people were already messing up by taking communion in the hand (it's sacrilege for it not to be taken by the priest putting it in your mouth) as well as taking communion while in mortal sin. These people are so modernist in belief that I'm not surprised they are excited about the chance to be lazy about Sunday obligations</p>
<p>Traditional Catholics, however, do believe in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and see it vital for spiritual salvation. So it's the Traditional Catholic community who are most affected as now the pressure to stay out of the state of mortal sin is greater, and barely any priests are offering confessions (the only way to fully get out of mortal sin) so lots of people have been in danger of losing salvation</p>
<p>Of course the main fault of this are the pope, the cardinals, the archbishops, and all the priests below who capitulated without a fight to the pope's lockdown policies. All Christian leaders could have banded together to protest locking down every type of Christian church, but sadly Catholic leadership is so corrupt and cowardly that they've sold out their own flock.</p>
<p>So anyway, when it comes to the entire catholic community, I'm not surprised at all with the number of those who support the lockdowns :/</p>

        <p>Wow, are you a Sedevacantist?  </p>
<p>I'm asking, not criticizing. Most people think of the Catholic church as monolithic.    I'm a fan of Pope Francis but understand that while he is a titular head there is a HUGE bureaucracy.   I also have to continually question the spiritual authority of rituals mandated as ordained by God, but changing every few years.  (And why is "consubstantial" better than "homoousion" when no English speaker really knows the meaning of either?)</p>

        <p>I hit up Target regularly during all of this - even before my state mandated masks.  </p>
<p>Where was the righteous indignation then?  </p>
<p>There was a lot of "stay the f- home", sure, but there was no beating up people who went in.  Funny how it now matters to people.</p>

        <p>Because modern  American churches are weak. Its more about showing up than actually reading the Bible. They are the Laodicean church Revelation was addressing,  imo.</p>
<p>Obviously not all of them, but I've been pretty disappointed in a lot of churches recently.</p>

        <p>I'm not personally a religious person / church goer, but, I really appreciate the rant.</p>
<p>I'm so sick of seeing people be ridiculed, belittled, shamed, accused of "being selfish" and even <em>physically attacked</em> for not conforming to this lunacy. People have been literally killed for refusing to wear a mask. Even though all of the science and common sense until now has unequivocally shown masks not to be helpful against respiratory illness viruses. It has clearly become more about compliance than anything else.</p>
<p>People are going to need to realize and accept the fact that all of these ongoing mandates are <em>not</em> a good thing for <em>anybody</em>. Freedom is not optional, negotiable or revokable. Certain individuals/businesses being deemed "non-essential" and major essential human activities being restricted should be a huge red flag for everybody. <em>Especially</em> for supposedly a supposed virus that is no serious danger to the overwhelming majority of the population.</p>

<p>There is a <em>deeply</em> nefarious psychological effect to calling people "non-essential".</p>
<p>Who is to say someone is "non-essential"?</p>
<p>I mean, sure, the guy at the coffee shop doesn't need to make you coffee, but damned if he's not essential to the little girl he goes home to at the end of his shift.  </p>
<p>They say you could be killing grandma, but if grandma was in the nursing home anyway, is she "non-essential"?</p>

        <p>I follow a Subreddit for a denomination of Christians who are typically very “pro-Church”, as in, you are basically not a serious believer unless you are a faithful member of a Church. Even on that Subreddit, people are virtue signaling about how they are not attending Church until there is a vaccine or an “effective testing and contact tracing plan” since they do not want to “contribute to the spread of a deadly disease.” It’s sad to see many Christians giving in to the fearfulness of the culture.</p>

        <p>I think it's fear - church leaders are probably terrified someone in their congregation will die from picking up covid at church. Which, as some one who is not religious, I thought the point of religion was to have faith that whatever happens is part of God's plan. So I'm confused why that traditional line he gone out the window right now.</p>
<p>Either way hope governments wake up to hypocrisy of banning one form of gathering but not another, so at least people can choose of they want to attend.</p>

        <p>When it comes to Catholicism, many priests are very loyal to the Vatican II/Novus Ordo regime and were more than happy to fall in line with Pope Francis' lockdown policies. I know of several priests in my area who were so cowardly and fearing for THEIR OWN lives too much to do their duty and serve their parishes. And when you're a catholic who believes in the Traditional aspects like the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist or the concepts of mortal and venial sin, it's insulting seeing the cowardice of the priests who openly go along with this madness.</p>
<p>I've seen stories of Protestant churches protesting by holding services outdoors or even indoors during lockdowns and unfortunately not enough did this. But even still it's a better effort than most catholic churches did.</p>
<p>As for the reason Christian services were shut down but not other activities... Well I won't get too conspiratorial but there's enough research material to imply the hatred against Christianity and the movement to abolish it, so that's probably the main reason those are shut down but not protests/riots</p>

        <p>Not just the death itself - in fact religion should be a source of comfort in such a time.</p>
<p>Above and beyond that, I think churchgoers should be the most accepting of death, because while no one really wants to die, if they do die from whatever, there will be a community surrounding them to send them on their way and remember them.  And because funeral rites are a sacrament - they are the fundamental part of being Catholic, so accepting that it is a sacrament is to accept that it is a thing that happens.</p>
<p>But being put under a national spotlight and publicized and condemned because they did the wrong thing is something different.</p>
<p>There's truth from the people who say that people who aren't "following the rules" (whatever arbitrary rules that in your head are the good and righteous ones) don't want to be exposed.  Because the people who condemn will shoot first, shoot second, shoot some more and after everyone's dead, declare victory and blame the corpses for getting themselves shot.</p>
<p>You might be right, but you don't want your history written by the people who can't be bothered to ask your side of the story.</p>

        <p>I don't talk about my faith, at all, and have a mouth that would make a sailor blush, but I attended a new church, that had in-person services last week. Strangers hugged me. No masks. I took communion for the first time in years, and I felt a little piece of my soul restored on Sunday. I will be going back, and I am happy to have found it.</p>

        <p>People underestimate the healing power of hugs.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I attended a church camp (Unitarians, before they completely left orbit), at which if you were discovered to be a first-timer (it was on your badge), people would approach you and ask if you wanted a hug.  Lots of people.  </p>
<p>I had more hugs in that one week than I had maybe in a decade.  </p>
<p>I also don't remember the last time I felt so good about my life.</p>

        <p>I used to know one of those militant atheists (who are more correctly characterized as anti-theists, and I think that word should be used more).  </p>
<p>It seemed to me he had a god-shaped hole in himself.  He hated god.  He hated the idea of god, and he hated the idea that anyone else might believe in god.</p>
<p>That's silly.  You don't believe in god, fine.  Don't believe.  But don't be a raging a-hole when it comes to people not making the same choices you would make in life.  </p>
<p>Me?  I'm agnostic.  I don't care about the discussion about whether or not there is a god, but I will say: I will defend your right to believe and worship as you choose, and no one has the right to tell you different.  Some of the best people I know are religious, and good on them.  </p>
<p>If religion brings you love, comfort and joy and you are enriched as a person because of it, let no one take it from you.  Your right to it should be enshrined in the law.  And it absolutely sucks that everyone seems to be against the religious folk of this country.</p>

        <p>The church has become very spineless. And at least in my denomination (ELCA), also weirdly involved in (Democrat) politics. Like I literally heard one of our pastors brag about how "When our bishop calls the governor, he picks up!"</p>
<p>I pointed out that that didn't sit right with me and they were like "Huh? Why not?" Like if you love Jesus, it shouldn't be hard to understand why it's good for churches to keep a healthy distance from the government... but no, they love this idea of "public private partnerships". 🤮 </p>

        <p>It sounds crazy, but covid nazis hate Jesus. It's not that they're ambivalent or indifferent, they actually hate the Prince of Peace with a burning passion. The name of Jesus fills them with anger and disgust, it's so weird.</p>

        <p>Yeah, plus Christ hit a sore spot with this: <em>Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.</em></p>

        <p>I take no credit; I heard a deacon at my church who is a construction worker say it under his breath when our priest announced that we would no longer be doing zoom services even if they shut down churches completely, and instead would pursue other in-person options. I asked him later if he heard that somewhere and he said no, it was just a thought.</p>

        <p>OK, so our Quaker Meeting shut down <em>before</em> the lockdown orders were issued by Gov. Wolf - "Out of an abundance of caution", the Clerk said.  I should add that the Clerk of a meeting is not an authority in the usual sense, more of a coordinator. We have regular business meetings open to all members and that is where decisions are made.  But that's moot - she did make a bunch of calls, and most members agreed that we should shut down.  :-(</p>
<p>A couple of weeks in, someone suggested Zoom meetings and there was much enthusiasm for the idea.  Not so much from our older tech-challenged members, but most folks signed on.  I tried it for two weeks and it just left me cold. No spirituality there at all, IMO.  I said as much to other members, they didn't agree. They did point out that it's good to see everyone's faces, and I grant them that.  Nevertheless, I didn't continue.  </p>
<p>Even the New York Times got into the act, with an article showing Zoom screencaps of Quakers all around the New York metro area.  How quaint... puke.</p>
<p>Long after "flatten the curve" came and went, my wife and I and one other member pushed to re-open the meeting.  General horror was the reaction to that.  So my wife said "OK, we have a beautiful property, what about meeting outside?  Bring camp chairs and sit apart from each other?"  That was grudgingly approved, though at first they didn't want to open the bathrooms (WTF? but they relented) and most attenders of the Zoom said they probably wouldn't join us.</p>
<p>Come the first outdoor Meeting, we couldn't have had more perfect weather.  Sun, blue skies, perfect temperatures, gentle breezes.  We were surprised when quite a few people showed up after all!  Most were wearing masks, and sitting a ridiculous distance apart from each other, but they came!  It's funny, the fantastic weather held for the next three meetings.  Almost as if it was a sign from God.  ;-)  Once, I stood up to speak about religious freedom and the dark symbolism of wearing the mask, but that didn't go over very well. </p>
<p>The Zoom meetings have continued, in parallel with the outdoor meetings.  The Zoomers are the most convinced Doomers and I don't know when we'll see them in person again. There has been talk about opening up the Meetinghouse again, but it's bogged down with how to sanitize the wooden benches and cushions (WTF?) and how many hand sanitizer stations we'll need and of course masks will be required and and and...  so sad.</p>
<p>What's the point of First Amendment protection of the right to worship if the members waive the right themselves?  </p>
<p>And where is their faith?  How many times did Jesus say "because your faith is strong, you have been healed"?  Not "hey I healed you" or "Oh, your faith is impressive but there's this novel virus thingie going around so you are doomed, sorry"?</p>

        <p>I'm not religious at all, but it's vital to mental health and community for many, many people to be able to gather together in worship. I can't imagine being able to get anything like that out of prerecorded sermons or zoom discussion groups.</p>

        <p>Here in the Seattle area a lot of my friends are stereotypical BLM, atheist, liberals etc and love the lockdown.</p>
<p>It makes me feel like an alien.</p>
<p>Gun shooting, church going, country music listening people are the only sane ones right now. It makes me want to join a church or least give it a chance.</p>

<p>I've joined a few with some of my motorcycle riding friends. It was OK, because we live in several different states and normally only see each other on group rides once or twice a year.  So it was kind of a fill-in. But, a bunch dropped out of a group ride this year because of the DISEASE.  They suggested that we have a Zoom meeting with them once we're at camp.  Hell no!

        <p>I agree with you. I just got confirmed as Catholic last year, and being told to just deal with even HOLY WEEK being moved to Facebook Live was a slap in the face. I wanted the in-person Masses, not some substitute mass on TV or on Facebook with the priest in an empty church. I wanted to truly experience the rituals and feel the emotion now that I understood them. </p>
<p>Zoom happy hours fell out of favor in my office within a month or two. My extended family did two Zoom gatherings and had my sister’s baby shower in virtual format. Everyone was over it after that. My mom and I agree that in five years, no one will be saying how wonderful it was that we gave my sister an online baby shower. </p>
<p>I’m planning to quit an organization I joined because they said there won’t be any in-person meetings or events until next year, and having to sit at my computer for over an hour for a meeting after working from home all day isn’t my idea of fun. I just get nothing out of Zoom meetings either unless it’s with a small group and they’re short. Listening to multiple people answer the question “Update us on your life so we can get to know each other better!” is just as bad. And yes, I agree on the audio issues. How after five months have people not figured out how and when to mute? Why do some people never put their webcam on and I have to talk to a computer icon? </p>
<p>SNL was pretty close to reality with these skits on Zoom meetings and Zoom church: </p>

        <p>I opted out of zoom/fb live events/streaming events pretty early on.  (Beginning of April) As much as people love to push a zoom happy hour as a way to stay connected with friends, I realized it was leaving me feeling more disconnected.  Same goes for streaming/online events.  I just changed my rsvp to a no for an event in October that did a bait and switch from in person to online. Anyway, my mental health instantly improved as I started to do more in person stuff.</p>
