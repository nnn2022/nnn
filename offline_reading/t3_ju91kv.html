        <p>As someone who knows about electronics, a chip is useless. If you care about your privacy so much, get off reddit, cancel your internet and live in an area which hasn't been touched by humans. Because why chip people with a chip that can barely grab any useful information and has no way to transmit said information, when you can use cookies and internet tracking techniques that give x1000 more information that is x100 times more useful than what a chip can provide.</p>

        <p>Hey man that's not me who is saying that it's them, they're the ones who are trying to chip us and tgey also want to control us using that chip because it will be connected to 5g or 6g or whatever, so if anyone one acts up they will zap him/her with it and will take the money in his/her Bank because the Curancy will be digital, we will be slaves to them if we take the chip.</p>

        <p>Well the problem with this is that it assumes the chip has infinite energy, which it doesn't. Let's say the chip is like an nfc chip which is powered by the device it's communicating with. A chip that gets its power like this bot only has a range of a few centimetres, but also can't get any useful information. </p>
<p>On the other hand you have the internet, and more importantly cell phones. Your cell phones are a big tracking device. If you have phone service, you have a sim card which gives you a unique id I believe is called the imei. This could be used to tell exactly who you are, and considering that every phone has gps, you could easily track through that. The best advantage to using cell phones over chips is that instead of wasting millions of dollars, you gain millions from people willingly buying a government tracking device.</p>
<p>But lets say you don't have a cell phone, unlike everyone who complains about this "chip". You are using a social media website on the internet, of which has many ways of getting information from you. First, there's tracking cookies which are used to tell what websites you visit, how long, and many more things using the power of analytics, likely through google analytics. That information can be used to create a profile for you based on what you like, don't like, your interests, gender, and many more things. Then there's social media, where people willingly give up their privacy to tell people every little detail in their life. Reddit is a social media website you are on, of which you are expressing your opinion on. Lets imagine a scenario where the government wants to go after conspiracy theorists for some reason. Most of these conspiracy theorists post ridiculous amounts of stuff, sometimes personally identifying. Combine the data from the social media posts with the data profile companies like google have and they can identify most, if not all conspiracy theorists and can then do what they want(in this case eliminating said conspiracy theorists).</p>
<p>Tracking chips are a thing of the past. If you care about your privacy, leave reddit and abandon society.</p>
<p>Edit: And none of this goes on about 5g of which is almost as stupid of a conspiracy as flat earth. If you really want me to go on about how the sun is deadlier than 5g then please tell me</p>
