    <strong>I’m over it.</strong>
    <p><p>I just need to vent and have no direction at all, so this will probably be all over the place. Try to follow along, lol. </p>
<p>I work in healthcare... my patients are at risk population, given their age (I work in a skilled nursing facility, in therapy). We are very cautious (though loosening up depending on county rates). I think it’s perfectly acceptable to be a little extra cautious for those at risk. That said, we never experienced a major outbreak at my building, and haven’t had a positive staff member or resident in months. </p>
<p>That said... I have the vaccine, <em>most</em> of the people in my nursing home do (patients and staff). Yet, we still wear masks, which is whatever. We still get tested every week. I never tested positive, despite my wife testing positive in August, and I had to quarantine myself for two weeks, still had contact with her the entire time, too.</p>
<p>I live in the land of the free (Florida), so God bless ya if you live up north or out west. </p>
<p>Why were gyms closed but McDonalds left open? How is church bad, but Walmart okay? During the protests COVID went away for a month, but then came back in full swing. </p>
<p>Most of my family from up north didn’t come to my wedding. My coworkers (who work in healthcare, mind you) pretty much all showed up. My best man (brother) didn’t come to my wedding. He isolates himself from the world and wears a mask when he is around my parents in the house (he has to move home for now). The doom and gloom from the media is doing far more harm for those with mental health issues, like my brother, than the virus itself. </p>
<p>Having a different opinion on the virus, I feel like I’m at risk for losing my job. Why is it wrong to ask questions? </p>
<p>Where is the emphasis on eating better, getting sleep, and daily exercise? Instead it’s social distance and wear a mask... but here’s a free milkshakes for getting the vaccine, made by a teenager that has their mask halfway down their face and hasn’t washed their hands since they started their shift. </p>
<p>No concerts with major artists but at least local bars around here have some pretty decent cover bands. </p>
<p>I’m not right wing, I’m a left libertarian. Why does not falling line make me a “right wing job” to the crazies here on Reddit? Seriously, I would have voted for Andrew Yang or Tulsi Gabbard had they been the front runner, so definitely not a Trumper. </p>
<p>I’ve been going to the gym, gas stations, and bars maskless ever since Florida opened back up, but still feel weird walking into Publix without a mask (I have yet to do that). Why do I feel that way? </p>
<p>Why does it feel like everyone is okay with the way things are? Indefinitely...?</p>
<p>Common sense: if you’re sick, stay home. If you’re at risk, be cautious. But my brother in his mid 20’s shouldn’t be afraid to walk in his house with our boomer parents (who are pretty much living life as normal as they can, going to the gym, gatherings, out to eat etc) without a mask. Are the media and government happy with what they did to people with mental health issues? </p>
<p>Like I said, I just needed to vent and this rant went nowhere. I just know this was the safest place to do so. Thanks for reading!</p></p>

        <p>I feel you. It's so sad to watch our normal lives being taken away, your closest people turning their back on you cause of their fears. All we can do is try and continue living as normal as we can and hope people will take the lead. I'm sure there are people who will stand up to this bs and make a move inspiring others to take action against this.</p>

        <p>I got into an argument the other day with someone over Reddit about something entirely unrelated to covid and this person went into my comment history (didn’t read a single thing) but saw that I post to this forum and said “you lose this argument because you’re a covid denier.”</p>
<p>Before (and during) the pandemic, I considered myself pretty far to the left. Anti war, public healthcare, social safety nets, yadda yadda. Now Reddit considers me a far right covid denier because I think lockdowns are an abuse of government power.</p>
<p>You’re not alone!</p>
