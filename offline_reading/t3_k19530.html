    <strong>DO AS I SAY NOT AS I DO</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/24/us/cuomo-thanksgiving-new-york/index.html</p>
<p>&rt; New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo canceled his Thanksgiving plans after facing criticism for planning to have a holiday meal with his mother amid escalating numbers of Covid-19 cases.
&rt; 
&rt; On Monday, Cuomo told WAMC's radio host Alan Chartock that his <strong>89-year-old mother, Matilda Cuomo, was planning on traveling to join him in Albany, along with two of his daughters, for the holiday.</strong>
&rt; "My mom is gonna come up and two of my girls, is the current plan," Cuomo said.</p>
<p>&rt; Later in the interview -- as well as during his news conference earlier in the day -- Cuomo warned New Yorkers who plan on holding Thanksgiving celebrations as usual that it was dangerous given that the virus can spread in large indoor gatherings.</p>

<p>&rt;When the news networks called the presidential race for Joe Biden recently, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker took a victory lap through the streets of Chicago surrounded by other jubilant Democrats. He was out and about just days after being exposed to COVID-19 <strong>and while his public health director was telling everyday citizens to quarantine for 14 days following exposure</strong>, even after a negative test.</p>

<p>&rt;During his daily coronavirus news performance, just a few days after urging Illinoisans to "please travel only if necessary," <strong>Gov. Pritzker and his wife and children traveled from Chicago to their $12-million Florida horse farm for Thanksgiving.</strong></p>

<p>&rt; Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot celebrated Joe Biden’s election win in a street party, without a mask. <strong>The following week, she ordered a stay-at-home advisory and urged cancellation of all Thanksgiving plans.</strong></p>

<p>&rt;Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot went to her hairstylist for a trim despite a state order closing down all salons. Lightfoot was criticized for her actions after previously stating in one of her public service announcements that “getting your roots done is not essential." <strong>The mayor said in defense of her haircut during a press conference</strong> “I’m the public face of this city. I’m on national media and I’m out in the public eye.”</p>
<p>https://www.foxla.com/news/fox-11-obtains-exclusive-photos-of-gov-newsom-at-french-restaurant-allegedly-not-following-covid-19-protocols</p>
<p>&rt; New fallout on Wednesday evening over the two photos obtained exclusively by FOX 11 Tuesday night showing Governor Gavin Newsom dining at the luxurious French Laundry restaurant in Napa for the birthday dinner of well-known lobbyist Jason Kinney.
&rt; 
&rt; Newsom said he realized as soon as he sat down at the outdoor table that the group was larger than he had expected to celebrate the 50th birthday of Jason Kinney, a political adviser that Newsom said he has known for 20 years.
&rt; 
&rt; Not only do they call into question Governor Newsom's explanation that the dinner was outside <strong>they also reveal that two high-level members of the California Medical Association were there at the dinner</strong> with the governor and that’s sparking outrage.
&rt; 
&rt; Neither of them, as a matter of fact, no one at the table was wearing a mask or social-distancing <strong>despite the CMA funding an ad campaign this year urging people to wear masks.</strong></p>
<p>https://nypost.com/2020/09/01/nancy-pelosi-gets-hair-done-at-sf-salon-in-spite-of-covid-19-rules/</p>
<p>&rt; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got her hair done at a San Francisco salon — in spite of local coronavirus rules barring indoor personal-care services, Fox News reported. Hair salons and barbershops in San Francisco have been shuttered since March, and officials on Monday gave the OK to reopen, but for outdoor service only. <strong>Salon owner Erica Kious called the congresswoman’s visit “a slap in the face.”</strong></p>
<p>https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1328724072801431553?s=20</p>
<p>&rt; Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has called for nationwide mask mandates, was seen walking maskless through an airport in September and again in the hallway of the Capitol last week. The clip that went viral on Twitter shows her before the hearing, out in the hallway, <strong>talking in close proximity with two gentlemen who were both wearing masks, while she was not.</strong></p>
<p>https://dcist.com/story/20/11/10/bowser-covid19-delaware-joe-biden-speech-kamala/</p>
<p>&rt; DC Mayor Muriel Bowser traveled to Delaware for a Biden victory party, but didn’t follow her own quarantine protocols upon return. The Mayor attended Biden's victory speech in Wilmington, DE. <strong>Delaware is on the Mayor’s list of “High Risk” states which would require quarantine after returning. Bowser staff says the trip was “essential travel” exempted under Mayor’s order.</strong> </p>
<p>https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1325185940474761217?s=20</p>
<p>&rt; Sen. Chuck Schumer also partied for Biden maskless. In the video, <strong>without a mask, he sings</strong> 'Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye' with Biden supporters in Times Square.</p></p>

        <p>The ones attending maskless gatherings say they "made a mistake".  Yeah, they attended events planned in advance, with venues booked and stayed at the events for hours.  A "mistake" is occasionally forgetting your mask when you go in a store.</p>
