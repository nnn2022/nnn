        <p>Our entire system that trains people not to have thoughts like this. It begins with parents pushing their kids early on toward conformity and compliance with a school system...</p>
<p>But it REALLY picks up in school.</p>
<p>And then kids get phones... and as adults they graduate to watching TV news. They are programmed through the screens.</p>
<p>Everyone is programmed. Even us, here. And we don't know it. Think about it -- most of us work 5+ days a week for our entire lives to make a very small number of people incredibly wealthy and they just keep squeezing us more and more.</p>
<p>And the irony of that is -- they've squeezed so hard that most of us here are just asking for things to be like the way they were before 2020 which wasn't even that great.</p>
<p>Also, I don't know about Americans versus other countries but herre we are trained to "blame downward." Never blame corporations or their CEOs. Maybe blame opposing politicians (who are really two sides of the same coin) --- but REALLY blame downward. A lot of people here blame welfare people rather than those who created that system.</p>
<p>And then there's the whole worship of capitalism... Many people here, for example, can't hear criticism of capitalism without getting just as frothy at the mouth as the typical pro-Covid19 person ------- even if the person criticizing the weaknesses of capitalism aren't advocating for an alternative system.</p>
<p>But in reality, what we are in is late-stage-capitalism and corporations have taken complete control of the government.</p>
<p>Policies have led to a VAST difference between the ruling class and working people... So much so that they use that money to take control of the government that is supposed to represent us.</p>
<p>Normal people mean well, but normal people aren't "sick" and they don't understand the degree to which hoarders of wealth will exploit them... Even though it's been that way all through history. (Who built the pyramids?)</p>
<p>So what you end up with is working people who will race to the defense of their modern-day slavemasters. They say, "Well they DESERVE to be infinitely wealthy. They worked hard."</p>
<p>But in doing so they support a reality that allows a small number of individuals to take complete and total control over the world.</p>
<p>These people end up "hating government" without hating the people who have used their wealth to actually take control of the government.</p>
<p>The point being -- they think "getting rid of government" will solve the problem, but getting rid of the government doesn't get rid of the wealth inequality which allows a small number of people to take control over the rest of us.</p>
<p>Bottom line?</p>
<p>Our education system was deliberately dumbed down. The average person doesn't know anything about history or economics or science or math or language --- nothing.  They know <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>And because our populace is so dumbed down -- by design -- it's incredible easy to manipulate them with shiny slave-made objects as rewards for their labor, and screens with programming to reorder their thoughts toward subservience.</p>
<p>And you can take all the downvotes I get as proof of my point.</p>

        <p>We're calling it different things here, but I think you prove my point because your response and the upvotes you got are coming from a place of "defending capitalism."</p>
<p>All criticism of capitalism aside -- the fact people are triggered into such reactions is exactly the kind of programming I'm talking about.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for a very poor worker who suffers lifelong, trapped in his position and having nothing frothing at the mouth, ready to punch someone in the face over the mere mention of the world. It is very strange.</p>
<p>And that's really my point. We are ALL programmed, and that fiery Pavlovian response is very similar to the reaction of the pro-Covid people in regard to "anti-vaxxers."</p>

        <p>I'd argue I'm programmed by knowledge of history and what happens when you start giving in to the people who claim that everyone is either oppressed or an oppressor.</p>
<p>Very horrible things, happen, when those people get put in charge of society. The same people will adopt any talking point, or any identity, to get what they want. They will slaughter hundreds of millions of people to get their way.</p>
<p>So yeah, we're a little touchy. We've been tolerant for a long time now, and look where it's gotten us.</p>

        <p>Two things, you're already pivoting into this being an argument, like we're on two different sides or something. Don't do that, I don't even care that strongly about this issue.</p>
<p>Secondly -- as soon as you talk about "knowledge of history", that's both an important point but it's also one of the ways we get manipulated because official history is rarely accurate to what actually happened... And it's certainly written from the perspective of whatever force dominated that era.</p>
<p>I think the biggest difference here is the kind of corruption that you would see in what historically has been called "communism" isn't terribly different from the kind of corruption I see in capitalism.</p>
<p>Every system results in cunning people moving toward wielding power over others. ALL of them. And they all paint the rulers as heroes.</p>
<p>Our system does it, too. People treat CEOs like gods. Meanwhile, those CEOs have used their wealth to actively undermine the government to operate against the people and block out competition.</p>
<p>You say there's a problem when "people who claim that eveyrone is either oppressed or an oppressor get put in power." I get where you're going with that, and I agree with you.</p>
<p>But the problem starts before that, when people worship their ruling class and fail to see how they are oppressed to begin with.</p>
<p>Because yes, at the end of the day -- our capitalist system led predictably to a small number of people having ALL the wealth and the rest of us working for them, lifelong, all to have little or nothing at the end.</p>
<p>And then they squeeze, squeeze, squeeze until we all find ourselves here just desperate to return to a pre-2020 era.</p>
<p>But the most important takeaway here?</p>
<p>Criticism of capitalism is simply criticism of capitalism. It is NOT advocacy for another system.</p>
<p>But as long as people can't handle criticism of our current system, then it's impossible to address any of the real problems it has... And that is what led us to where we are today.</p>
<p>Yes, what we are going through today is the result of a small number of people having so much wealth they can control the globe. And where did those people come from? They were the winners of capitalism.</p>
<p>Now back to the programming -- the programming this is all about is why you will defiantly respond rather than just accept criticism.</p>
<p>That inability to accept criticism about the current system shields the powers that be from any changes that would have stopped this control over us.</p>
<p>What's happening now isn't "the government taking control of us." It is unimaginably wealthy people using their wealth to make government do this to us so that they can have even more control. See?</p>
<p>And again, please get it out of your head that I am advocating for any other system.</p>

        <p>I have not read that book. My thoughts on that matter are a result of coming up in a broken education system, seeing a generation after even worse off, and then experiences with my own kids in school where things are now unimaginably bad.</p>
<p>Bad enough we pulled our kids out of school and my wife homeschools them. My wife who has a bachelors in biology and masters in operatic performing arts, so please don't imagine the TV-programmed imagery of the religious weirdos with their weirdo homeschooled kids. :-)</p>
<p>So yeah... It's just obvious. A deliberate dumbing down of our entire society. The more I think about it, the more it seems like a deliberate build up to what may be happening now. </p>
<p>In 1975 Kissinger wrote Security Memorandum Study 200 which was declassified in 1989. It's all about the World Population Plan of Action. From what I can tell, that's when this stuff really began to pick up (although its rooted in the eugenics movement -- people forget that before WWII, USA was the eugenics capital of the world. It fell out of fashion after the horrors of what happened in Germany, but the families that took so much interest in eugenics raised children who raised children that rule the world today. That mindset is still prevalent in the elite.)</p>

        <p>I have much respect for home schooling, if I chosen to have kids, it’s the only way I’d have gone with it. back in the 80’s though, I new I didn’t want to bring kids up in this sadistic world. </p>
<p>I just recently learned how big the eugenics program was in our country. Pretty twisted people to say the least.</p>

        <p>Social engeneering , possibly in subtle ways before the more aggresive efforts of today. </p>
<p>A culture of anti-intelectualism in the youth (bullying the "nerds").

        <p>I think around 2014 was when I noticed people were seeming to be praised for being “introverted” and not wanting to be around people. I thought that was strange how many people seemed to gloat that they despise going to parties and would rather stay at home. There’s nothing wrong with it, but it was some people’s ONLY personality trait and they were very proud of it for some reason. Then in 2016 we began the fat acceptance movement, which was supposed to be body positive that I’d have no problem with, which made incredibly unhealthy people feel like they were actually the pinnacle of health and beauty. </p>
<p>Anyways flash forward to 2020 and we are forced (by the govt) into isolation for a disease that is pretty deadly for the obese. Interesting how that works out. I think that’s why some people have been so proud of locking down, especially if they’ve been following all of the other trends. It combines everything they think they should be proud of about themselves.</p>
