        <p>"AHS spokesperson Kerry Williams confirmed that the patient was in their  80s, and was one of two deaths linked to one of two outbreaks of the Delta variant (B.1.617.2)."</p>
<p>I don't want to minimize the death in any way, but it was someone who was already sick, and in their 80s.  Tragic, but not unexpected.</p>
<p>i saw that comment and i’m thinking so it’s fine that they pass away from the vaccine they were sick and old anyways but yet they would have a mental breakdown if it was from covid.. so weird.</p>
