        <p>Read the FDA briefings in their entirety (ask yourself what information is clearly lacking or skewed), read the ingredients and deep dive into what they are and what exactly they do to you (for each vaccine), dig into the companies past controversies regarding drugs and vaccines and their responses to them. Do research. Don't be gullible enough to believe the media or government when they tell you it's SAFE and to just TRUST them, ask questions, don't comply just because they tell you to. And if people call you crazy it's because they are the ones who are lost in a trance. You'd be crazy not to ask questions and ask for proof when allowing some stranger to inject an unknown substance into your body, especially when there is no liability involved if something goes wrong. Call me anti vaxx, call me a conspiracy theorist, call me whatever. But before you do, are YOU actually researching what you are allowing someone to put in your body, or are you blindly trusting the information they give you without so much as a hesitation?</p>

        <p>Sort of. It’s mainly talking about the fact the vaccine doesn’t prevent transmission, only prevents symptoms, which means fatal strains that would have killed a host no longer do. So fatal strains will spread among the vaccinated to eventually kill everyone unvaccinated.</p>
<p>The main gist is just that it’s going to lead to more fatal strains</p>

        <p>That’s why this guy is calling for a complete halt to vaccinations. They are being irresponsible, Fauci or the CDC need to address the leaky vaccine theory.</p>
<p>Wait a couple months until you hear on the news the virus has mutated to become more fatal. And it won’t be because of the vaccines, or at least that’s what they’ll claim...</p>

        <p>I haven't read it yet but here's a PDF that appears to be exactly what you are looking for: https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/resources/pharma_covid-19_report_web.pdf</p>
<p>Strongly recommend this article: </p>
<p>https://off-guardian.org/2021/03/30/covid-vaccine-nonsense/</p>
<p>That website Off-Guardian in general has lots of great articles, but this article in particular demolishes all doubt and conclusively demonstrates that the vaccines are bullshit in a way that I'd say is irrefutable.</p>
<p>I also recommend checking out thelastamericanvagabond dot com. He does 2 hour videos on this stuff near daily and posts all of them and all his sources on that site. Lots of stuff to be found there.</p>
<p>Global Research and Children's Health Defense (Children's Health Defense is almost certainly the #1 largest compendium documenting big pharma crime on the internet) also have tons of great articles, although there is a considerable chance these will be dismissed as "conspiracy theory" sites by MSM-loving type people. But you can cite their articles' sources.</p>
<p>Next, here's a site that thoroughly documents the numerous highly effective, widely-available treatments (Vitamin D, HCQ, Ivermectin, etc.) that have been actively ignored and suppressed (even censored) by the media and the government in favor of an exclusively "vaccine"-focused agenda: https://c19early.com</p>
<p>The fact that the govt/media do not want us to know about these effective and safe treatments and wants us to take a dangerous experimental "vaccine" (that doesn't even prevent C19 infection or transmission or symptoms) instead is very telling. It shows that this is not about our health.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out their <a href="https://c19hcq.com/countries.html">HCQ world map</a>. It will definitely raise an eyebrow as to what the US and its intelligence allies are doing.</p>
<p>Also lots of good material here: https://swprs.org/covid19-facts/</p>
<p>SWPRS' Covid-19 section is pretty much the most comprehensive, thoroughly sourced, concise and easy to understand demolition of the covid narrative you will find. The whole site is very scientific and is near impossible to dismiss as a "conspiracy" site.</p>
<p>The next few resources are not necessary for your needs but valuable nonetheless.</p>
<p>First is unlimitedhangout.com. Their articles are very long but very well-documented and comprehensively sourced. They explore in-depth the role that intelligence agencies and deep state milieu like the World Economic Forum are playing in all this. Probably not that relevant for your family but important info nonetheless for understanding what this is all about that won't be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>Speaking of the WEF, here is a great article explaining their Great Reset agenda in clear terms: https://off-guardian.org/2020/10/12/klaus-schwab-his-great-fascist-reset/</p>
<p>If you prefer a documentary I'd suggest a film called <a href="https://brandnewtube.com/watch/the-new-normal-documentary_ecuUiUhHpP9INeh.html">"The New Normal"</a> to learn about the Great Reset.</p>

        <p>Another whistleblower people should know about is former Pfizer VP <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Michael_Yeadon">Michael Yeadon</a>.</p>
<p>Here's some of his terrifying quotes:</p>
<p>&rt;“It’s become absolutely clear to me, even when I talk to intelligent people, friends, acquaintances … and they can tell I’m telling them something important, but they get to the point [where I say] ‘your government is lying to you in a way that could lead to your death and that of your children,’ and they can’t begin to engage with it. And I think maybe 10% of them understand what I said, and 90% of those blank their understanding of it because it is too difficult. And my concern is, we are going to lose this, because people will not deal with the possibility that anyone is so evil…”</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&rt;“If you wanted to depopulate a significant portion of the world, and to do it in a way that wouldn’t require destruction of the environment with nuclear weapons, or poisoning everyone with anthrax or something, and you wanted plausible deniability, whilst you had a multi-year infectious disease crisis; I don’t think you could come up with a better plan than what seems to be in front of me. I can’t say that’s what they’re going to do, but I cannot think of a benign explanation for why they are doing it.”</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&rt;“It's completely absurd to vaccinate the whole world. Our politicians here in the UK and their advisors just lie to us and lead us down the wrong path. It is a crime. It starts with the untrustworthy PCR test. It scares people. In this way, restrictive measures can be implemented. I can only see non-medical reasons for the global vaccinations.”</p>

        <p>He's right - a large portion of our population has been brainwashed via media (watch opening sequences for all news networks - spinning circles, loud noises, flashing lights) and they've been reset into factory NPC mode. Critical thinking on this subject has been white washed with this worship of "agreed upon science". Science has never been about trust, it's always been about testing, measuring, verifying, and then testing, measuring and verifying. "Trust the science" is a calming emotional escape for the NPC zombies.</p>

        <p>The stigmatization of “conspiracy theorists” in particular I think has programmed a huge number of people to instinctively reject the very idea that the government could intentionally perpetrate deceptive and malicious acts against the public, as if it were a ridiculous, impossible proposition. </p>
<p>They do this despite the fact that they know factually in their brains that this is basically all our government and many other governments ever do. But they are not thinking with their brains. Their programming overrides factual information. They have been taught not to think and never to connect the dots.</p>

        <p>Google is completely useless. Not on health matters exclusively, but anything you search for. You get either irrelevant results or ancient pages. It has to do with the filters they have in place to push the government propaganda. They literally ruin every search.</p>

<p>Seems like it's wrong to be white now lol Some people will blame people of color for this but the truth is that these movements are run by rich white men who are using these people for their own benefits and they are creating divisions...Black people are not dumb,they know they are being used.</p>

        <p>To maintain and to increase division among the global populace, the global elites have long favored the utilization of nearly all of the ISMs: racism, sexism, genderism, classism, lookism, ageism, nationalism, tribalism, spiritualism, etc., and then they convince us that some innocent group over there is the cause for all of our suffering and misery.  Yet, in reality, it is the global elites who are responsible, but they skillfully manipulate us into believing it some other group of people, and they manage to do this without even revealing their own existence to the populace.  How could we ever blame the true culprits here when most of us are not even aware of their existence???  Masters of manipulation, they are!</p>

        <p>Not a better suggestion, I suppose. Only advice and perspective... but one needn't look too far based on both companys' profit motives... Say what you will about which companies you do and do not trust but there's a small decision matrix when deciding which one to choose:</p>
<p>Google's main algorithmic objective is to provide you more personalized search results. This is primarily why Google dominates the ad game—and also accounts for more than 95% of their balance sheet. A user is more likely to click on an ad. To find answers Google thinks you'll most likely click on—and thus, different methodology for relevance, but potentially more relevant to you, choose Google.</p>
<p>Microsoft's main algorithmic objective is to provide you more relevant search results. Microsoft on the other hand still makes a cool $10B per year on ad search revenues—but, that's less than 7% of their revenues on their balance sheet. To find niche, but relevant results based on your query largely decoupled from user behavior, Bing/DDG is your answer.</p>

        <p>I can testify that even if it does carry some authoritarian attributes, it still isn't as blatant as Google, and can still produce more useful search query results.  There are plenty of search engines online to use, but Google's usefulness is pure trash unless you are searching for today's weather, some restaurant's menu, or kitten videos!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You laugh, or so you allege, but if you are aware that DDG has the same issues as Google, mainly because it is based on Bing, and perhaps just not as useless, then why do you not suggest an alternative?  I could shit talk nearly any subject matter, product, company, or person, but what benefit does that provide anybody unless I bring some form of alternative for people to consider?</p>

        <p>My reply was based on the fact that the OP chose an alternative based on a misconception about authoritarian search results... not usefulness. I think the conflation between what's authoritarian and what's personalized is what's so troubling to me. The premise, perhaps a false one, is that because Google personalizes your results based upon your behavior (re: your data), someone chooses an alternative search engine they think may be a better alternative simply because they think they're sticking it to a big tech corporation... when in reality, it's the other tech giant that profits and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>But, in this age, people on the whole choose convenience over their moral conscience. You're asking for an alternative but there is no alternative. Big tech incumbents will not cede any ground where they can profit on data. Period.</p>

        <p>I won't go into detail regarding how Google's results for my various search queries have been degrading over the past two or three years, and how just in the past six months, the degradation seems to be accelerating.  Google will provide results that are somewhat related to my search queries, yet they do not fit the parameters of my search, rendering them completely useless.  However, the exact same queries verbatim on DuckDuckGo will yield useful hits!!  I could search for the exact title of a newspaper article, and if it is not exactly aligned with whatever false narrative the mainstream media are currently pushing, then it won't even be listed on the first ten pages of results.  However, on DuckDuckGo, it will typically be in the top 4 results!!!!  They will have their excuses, and bullshit reasoning about how they are not censoring results, but any semi-cognitive person would know better!</p>

        <p>aluminum hydroxide, formaldehyde, polyethylene glycol? as a chemistry major about to receive my degree in a month or two some of these ingredients are wack and dangerous and state plainly on Google linked to the FDA website ingredients that are in vaccines are <em>not</em> individually tested for safety. </p>
<p>They literally measure the weight of what the rudimentary human made vaccine of human hubris could do for us compared to any “speculated cost” in ingredients that literally aren’t tested or measured individually and include plastic embalming fluid and a strong base that may show aquatic toxicity (each of these three things are environmentally unfriendly, there’s other oils and anionic surfactant type molecules etc.) big trash</p>

        <p>Yeah this came out a while back on youtube vids. The thing is I think this guy works for the billy gates agenda (b&amp;m gates foundation is actually on his resume, but thats not what I mean)</p>
<p>So what is he actually saying:</p>
<p>- Stay away from vaccinated people (more polarization)<br>
- He wants more new vaccines...<br>
- Massive fearmongering (keep people scared to keep them gullible)</p>
<p>That's enough for me to believe this guy is not trying to help but just another guy on the payroll. Yeadon and Cahill I find are more trustworthy. </p>
<p>Ofcourse I could be wrong, it's very difficult to see who's on our side and who's not. Remember the elite always funds both sides.</p>

        <p>Silly. Dr. Bossche is a veternarian. He worked in management at the Gates Foundation, not research. He warns that  virus may mutate. Yes, it may, but then we develop a new vaccine. Viruses may mutate even if there is no vaccine. Vaccination has been working since Jenner vaccinated for smallpox in 1796. No friggin big deal.</p>

        <p>That... Is just not how vaccines work.
The only time that would be true if you have covid and get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Vaccines PREVENT by injecting a harmless but harmful enough sample of covid so your immune system gets rid of it and learns how to fight covid.</p>
<p>No vaccine ever makes your immune system substantionaly weaker. UNLESS youre immunocompromised at which point you rely on herd immunity and other people to rake the vaccine.</p>
<p>The point of a vaccine is to WEAKEN any covid "attack". A vaccine will never make a virus stronger unless you take it when you have the virus.
At which point if that happens. Its the doctors fault and you have every right to be mad about it.</p>

<p>That is not <em>remotely</em> how MRNA vaccines work. I urge you to look at Moderna and Pfizer's websites and educate yourself on how they work. You are describing the typical vaccines of the past, the covid vaccines are entirely different. </p>
<p>Also, I was just summarizing what the virologist who has spent 30 years studying and understanding viruses has alleged. He certainly knows more about the subject than you or I.</p>

        <p>I read the entire article. They used statements that already existed and one quote from a doctor. It was far from a disproval, and did not specifically address anything. Just the same old “CDC says we should wear masks”. </p>
<p>I’m just saying it’s a bad look for them to list USA today as a source. They should have gone and listed the sources USA Today used instead of USA Today. Even if you agree with everything politifact said, it still looks bad to use USA Today as a source.</p>
