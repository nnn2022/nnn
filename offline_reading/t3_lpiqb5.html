    <strong>This is a war and you are much stronger than the enemy</strong>
    <p><p>Let me preface this by saying once again that "covid" is a cover-up for a massive global economic crisis (caused by overproduction of goods and services - see K.Ostrovityanov "Political Economy", chapter "Economic crises") which began all the way back in 2008. It had several ups and downs since then; during the "downs", the global production was cut and surplus products were destroyed, the workforce laid off. But nothing helped, of course. A new round of crisis called for an unprecedented curtailment of the global production and governmental expenses. For those of you who are not aware of this, government is not something that exists in a vacuum, it's not independent from the rest of the society. The government, a law making apparatus, belongs to whoever owns the means of production and therefore holds all the money. Whoever owns plants, factories, oil rigs, mines, agricultural plantations etc etc and gets enormous profits by appropriating the result of labour of millions and billions of people, can dicatate their will through politics. So they also appropriate all the tax money and the rest of the treasury and decide how much to spend on plebs so they don't revolt. When these production owners and finance capital owners have a crisis, they cut the production and they cut their expenses. They shut down hospitals, reduce the amount of hospital beds, reduce financing of schools, universities, reduce salaries of governmental workers etc etc.</p>
<p>Because a new round of the crisis called for an unprecedented curtailment of the global production and governmental expenses and because the global protest wave (against these measures) was already on the rise (see "global protest wave" in 2019), the above-mentioned capital holders (or "stakeholders" as Schwab puts it) had to use total deception in order to achieve their goals and not get  overthrown in the process, because remember - they are an absolute minority who are bullying and ordering around an absolute majority. How to destroy surplus pigs and poultry in the food indsutry? Say the livestock is infected with an "incurable disease". How to curtail the global production and cut governmental (=your) expenses? Say that there is a new "deadly virus" and social gatherings have to be banned (=anti-protest measure, making sure people don't conspire against you),  factories have to be shut down (=slowing down the production in  order to get the surplus products - e.g. steel rolls or cars or food etc etc that you were unable to sell because of drop in demand and which were piling up in warehouses - gradually dissolve), millions of workers laid off, small and medium capitalists have to be destroyed (because this way you can replace them on the market) etc.</p>
<p>So it's really a war, if you think about it. A class war. Because the "stakeholders", those who own the plants and factories and land and other means of production and the government, along with small and medium business owners (owning smaller enterprises, smaller staff etc) are one class and all the rest are the other class - the class of the hired workers, or what's been previously known as the proletariat. The working class, people who are involved in material production, are the vanguard of the proletariat - they are the most revolutionary part of it, because they are the most exploited and therefore it is in their deepest interest to realize the unfairness of the situation and fight against it. They also hold the most power against the other class - when they down tools and stop the production, the "stakeholder" starts losing money rapidly. A protest of young lefties, or a protest of teachers, doctors, office workers etc doesn't scare the "stakeholders" in the least. Their bulldogs just train how to disperse large crowds and that's all.</p>
<p>Since this is an actual war, all the tricks that are typical for warfare, are used. For example, demoralization and desinformation. The opposing forces (hired workers and all the rest) have to be constantly bombarded with psychological terror in order to be weakened and therefore unable to resist and fight back. Remember, the "stakeholders" are an absolute minority. Their position is very unstable - if people realize how much they are getting screwed over by a bunch of parasites, how much misery and death this brings, their force will be unstoppable and their vengeance unlimited. The "stakeholders" have to do everything in order to prevent that. First and foremost, they have to bluff. They make it look like they are this all-powerful, all-surveying monster that you have no chance to defeat. But that's BS - again, they are an absolute minority. Their main trick is to make the majority, this enormous giant, to feel helpless and powerless. In Nazi Germany, in fascist Italy, in fascist Japan the majority of the population did not participate in the atrocities. They were just passive and fooled. That's all it took.</p>
<p>By spending lots of your time online, scrolling through scary content about the corona scam you are helping them. You're putting yourself down. Many people on here have spoken of suicidal thoughts. That's exactly the sort of thing that the organizers of the scam want. Instead of filling your brain with all this negative information, you must get out there in the real world. If you already understand that what you are witnessing is a crime against humanity, there is no point in passively surfing the Internet any further.</p>
<p>Unite with like-minded people in your neighborhood. Go door to door and gather yourself a council (a group of people making decisions together and acting together). Hold a collective discussion. Determine your plan of action. For example: taking matters to court against the PCR tests that are not designed to diagnose anything and hence they are unfit to be used as evidence for the state of epidemic - but in this case remember, that the court system also belongs to the "stakeholders"; agreeing to down tools at work and go on strike; agreeing to protect each other in case of attack from the police or fascist medics and put up immediate collective resistance in case of any onslaught of the opposing forces. Etc. Make other neighborhoods do the same - have a council with headquarters, so that you can have a collection of councils fighting together.</p>
<p>Get out there. You need to realize your own power, stop helping them demoralize you.</p></p>

        <p>You doomers give Klaus Schwab way to much credit for things he doesn't deserve. Dont get me wrong, I believe he has some animosity towards americans as the purpose of his "covid 19" was solely to scare westerns. Every "scary" event his book was trying to predict didn't happen, there is no famine in america. No one is literally dying from hunger in the US, not one person.  Prices of food were on a steady rise, but my local grocery store has stayed stocked up. The only time there are empty shelves are before a storm, like these winter storms. But the prices arent that bad, I bought 2 5lbs porkloins for 7.50 each today. </p>
<p>Technology companies are still producing the next model of cell phones, tablets and electronics every year, some with double the amount of displays. Computer companies and still producing a new video card every two months.</p>
<p>My state was just given back live music, being our CV cases are down 80%, and life is slowly returning to normal.  Outside of sowing fear into westerns,  I'm having a problem believing Klaus Schwab can influence anything that would dramatically impact our lives. He will crock by 2030.</p>
