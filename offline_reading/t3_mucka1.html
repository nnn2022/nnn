        <p>I saw that person's account, he or she is almost 70 days in and deteriorated mental health. God have mercy on us all. I really hope no one has to suffer because of this, but that won't be the case.</p>
<p>One of their comments</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not sure why this is not being mentioned buy moderna /Pfizer the CDC or the FDA. I hardly think that we are just a minor few. Nonetheless, some attention needs to be brought to this. The amount of money I am spending going to doctors appointments for a resolution is ridiculous. If from the beginning Moderna would just say hey the side effects may linger be on the 1 to 4 days if so be patient, then maybe we wouldnâ€™t have so much anxiety, spent all of this money seeking treatment, and exposing our body tomorrow unnecessary pharmaceutical toxic crap. Iâ€™m so furious.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's the unmentionable, the medical bills alone if things go bad, will crush some people economically into bankruptcy. One hospital visit could clean me out and my husband has no medical insurance. They will hunt you down too if you don't keep them paid, and take your car away etc etc. </p>
<p>I used stimulus money, a huge chunk of it for husband to go to a specialist thankfully nothing extreme is wrong so far.  My medical bills are already high [disabled] and now I have to see a new specialist and afraid of what is down the road.</p>
<p>There is open censorship of these people's troubles, that much is obvious, by that alone no one should take the poison shots because if it goes bad there's no help, no resolution and your voice is taken away. The fact you can see mental derioration is scary.  I think it's all going to go bad. I swear I have seen subtle effects in people already who have had the shots. </p>
<p>People don't realize how bad health things can get and how one's life can be absolutely destroyed. [I have several autoimmune diseases and do, so I had no interest in the shots, I figure I have suffered enough already] The fact healthy and young people are being destroyed this way fills me with absolute horror.</p>

        <p>I am 13 days out from Pfizer shot 2. Started headache 24 hours after and had fever that was expected in first 48 hours. The headache never went away and a few days ago it came back quite strong. It has been changing in sometimes it's just pressure across my entire head, other times strong jolts that hurt a lot. Right now it feels like someone is pushing my head into my skull on my left side and it has been like this all day. There was a few hours where I felt like the left side of my body arm and face was heavy and then that resolved. I'm really scared. My doctor is starting to run tests. I don't know if it's related to the vaccine but seems odd timing. My doctor can't say either way. I'm hoping it will go away within the next week.</p>
<p>I feel awful sharing this information as I think it is important to get the vaccine and so many people I know got it and had no side effects or very little. But I also want to find out what is going on and if anyone else had side effects this far out from vaccine.</p>

        <p>I keep reading about people who are having month long headaches and other bad symptoms. Having the left side of ones arm and face feel heavy is not a good sign. Maybe see a neurologist for full testing. I think it is probably related to the vaccine. I know a lot of people who got sick from the vaccines and do not support them because they do not give immunity or stop transmission. I hope you feel better soon.</p>

        <p>Most people trust the experts. It horrifies me. I know I am seen as a "paranoid conspiracy theorist" and I am on the autistic spectrum so people didn't take my warnings seriously. Millions of people lined up. I have sympathy too but I am scared that people today trust the system that much even many fellow liberals I care about.</p>
