        <p>Wondering how many people will forgive their family members / friends when this is all over. I am looking at the way these people treat on another, the malice and hatred for even the suggestion of coming over for Christmas... These people do not seems like friends or family but an angry NPC in the game that you pissed off.</p>

        <p>It's quite tough because some days I feel surrounded by state/oligarchy humping doomers. Nearly everyone in my area wears masks, even outside when there are clearly no one near them. The family nearest me have fully bought into the hysteria and it's difficult not to hold a lot of disdain for them and I have to remember they've been thoroughly brainwashed. I drop hints here and there but I am doing best i can to avoid confrontation and I feel very alone. This subreddit has been a real help.</p>

        <p>Same, but you've still gotta look after your own safety too. I'm sure there were plenty of people in the USSR who were sure their friends and family members who bought wholesale into Uncle Joe's murder/death cult would <em>never</em> turn them into the NKVD.</p>

        <p>I'm just scared. I don't want to lockdown again. I don't want to wear a mask anymore. I want to not worry about my church being shut down. I want to rebel. But I can't. My parents are crazed rule followers in stores to "respect" the owners. It makes me sick to my stomach. I just wish I could start a revolt, and have everyone who believes the same join in. Today was my 15th birthday, but I just wonder if there is even a future worth fighting for anymore. I'm in tears right now, but im just scared.</p>
<p>EDIT Seeing as how some people are confused, I'm NOT scared of Covid. It't the fact that I know that this is how the end of our freedoms as people starts. Wearing a mask is not a minor inconvenience, It's major, how is the right to BREATHE properly minor?? It's not. So, yeah, just thought id clear that up.</p>

        <p>&rt;I just wonder if there is even a future worth fighting for anymore</p>
<p>When I was your age (can't believe I can say that!), I felt the same and that was from familial dysfunction and depression uncared for. I was heavily suicidal in my teens. If this happened when I was 15, I sincerely think I would've finally been pushed to do it. Hell, I ask myself a similar question: Was this worth sticking around for?</p>
<p>I realize this is much easier said than done for a teenager, but when it comes to parents, I learned sometimes, you just have to let them be mad and let them get over it when they do. My life would've been so much easier if I learned that lesson earlier. Yes, being 15, you're limited in what you do, but work with what you got.</p>
<p>Remember this for now and in the future: You can't take care of everyone and no one is entitled to someone giving up any piece of their life for them (except parents to their children, for a very obvious reason). That is selfish, but selfish is NOT A BAD WORD. Listen to and notice when you're called selfish. More often than not, "selfish" means "you won't do what I want". It starts when we're kids ("Share your toys! Don't be selfish!") and turns into this as adults.</p>
<p>And as a general rule: Adults aren't that different. We're just bigger and got a few years on you. Maybe you already figured it out, but one of the most eye-opening things for me in my twenties has been realizing my parents just winged it all the time. They never knew what they were doing.</p>

        <p>Yo! Happy birthday :) I’m 16 and I have to say I’m so happy to see someone my age on here. My parents are also doomers, and it’s the worst. I don’t know how to help or anything but I hope things go better for you. I think things are changing and hopefully people won’t put up with restrictions for a year. TBH what I do to stay sane is: hobbies, which don’t entirely help but are nice to distract yourself from the world (art, video games if you like them, reading or walking somewhere listening to music), finding out what you want to do in life and planning it out, and if you can (I can’t due to the ridiculous amount of unemployment in my area) find a part time job or babysit if your parents are ok with it. Pls don’t get into drugs or drinking or hurting yourself. I have a few friends and people I know who have done that and it doesn’t help them at all. Again, I don’t think these are solutions or anything but they help a little. :)</p>

        <p>The proper way to view stores is a private property issue. The owners can impose restrictions if they so choose. If the club says you have to wear a suit, then you have to wear a suit (if you want to join the club). I insist that people take shoes off before coming in my house, for example. But outside? Fuck that.</p>

<p>The minor sacrifices were the ones listed: wearing a mask, following some arrows in a store, and yes, lockdowns in especially hard-hit areas.   </p>
<p>The negative impact of the virus is undeniable, and the things you listed are tragedies. But wearing a mask is not one of them.</p>

        <p>Minor like 30 million unemployed. Minor off the charts suicide and over dose rates. Minor transfer of wealth. Minor loss of liberties. Minor cases of basically being put on house arrest.

        <p>I hosted a dinner last night and had to ban covid talk (it was getting incessant and honestly I just don’t want to talk about things that are going to get me fired up over a holiday meal I spend hours preparing, planning, and shopping for) and the reaction I got was “ok we will pretend it doesn’t exist”. Jesus Christ. No one is saying it doesn’t exist but it’s not a personality trait to literally only talk about covid nonstop. Ridiculous. This year has been shit but I mean things have still happened outside the realm of covid and I just don’t need to spend every waking hour of my life discussing it with people. It’s all I see in the grocery store, on the internet, in the news, at work...but god I mean so unreasonable for me to want to not talk about it for an evening. Just a rant.</p>

        <p>The trouble with you banning the talk (Though I agree with you) is that, for most people - there are so few topics to pick from. Sure, interesting people could talk of history, cars, music, ect - But in this world? Most peoples lives are gone. What's left to talk about besides politics and muh covid?  </p>
<p>They can't go to concerts, they can't go to any events, they can't really even have meetups or travel... It's like all of the good is taken from the world and we can only talk about the same filth over and over again. It sucks.</p>

        <p>For us we have tried our hardest to live normally during this- we go where we can, we have had gatherings, domestic travel, etc. plus the people over aren’t local family so we hadn’t seen them in so long. I understand that life is different, but surely there have been other things that happened over the course of almost 6 months of not seeing each other?</p>

        <p>Went to the grocery store to stock up in food before the big shut down here in Ontario. Had 3 different workers come up to me in the store in less than 2 minutes pestering me to wear a mask. We are no where near any hot spot, we have no cases, I am on the phone with my aunt, leave me alone.</p>
<p>Its supposed to be Christmas, and all I feel is anguish and depression. Anger and anxiety.</p>

        <p>Frankly with some of the me me me attitudes I have seen here, I have been pretty restrained. If it were up to me you'd all be rounded up and sent to re-education camps where you can learn about considering others, viruses, vaccines and other poignant topics. Perhaps you'd come out as more rounded, better individuals who actually give a fuck about others. Never mind, let's just keep repeating 99.5%. Fuck the 0.5% or the fact that the virus will undergo more mutations the more it is allowed to ravage the population. Despicable.</p>

        <p>Not contradictory at all. Millions of people are prisoners in their own home because they've been told that if they do what you do, they'll die decades before their time. So perhaps the favour can be returned. I don't give a fuck about you. I do give a fuck about my elderly relatives and some not so elderly who are now highly vulnerable because people like you can't find it within yourselves to wear a mask or socially distance. Whiny and entitled, your attitude is everything that's wrong with Western culture - all about the individual. A fact of life is that the UK and US is full of selfish twats.</p>

        <p>So I've gone from insulting to "virtue signalling". It's a measure of your IQ that would see you confuse wanting to slow the spread of a respiratory virus with virtue signalling. Not even in the same league lady. You wear a mask for 12 hours a day? Are you a nurse or a medical professional? If you wear a mask, why the fuck are you arguing with some stranger then? What you wear a mask but don't see the need for lockdown - is that it? A mask only works if everyone around you is also wearing one. What I want? What you think I want us all to be in this position? Let me send you a diagram. It will sketch out your arse and your elbow and help you tell the difference in future.</p>

        <p>So your statement was pointless then - " I wear a mask stop assuming shit" and then you say only wear a mask because you are forced to. This is too easy. As for insults, you've led a very sheltered life if you think what I've said so far is insulting. Not even in second gear yet. I am bored, yes. My area is completely fucking locked down enforced by traffic cops issuing fines because of bellends that believe what you believe. Whiny? Fucking raging.</p>

        <p>No echo chamber here just reality. My wife came off a call with her boss at the local hospital. She's been shielding since March because of an autoimmune disease. They are now pressuring her to go back in to work because 60% of the staff on the wards are positive and have had to be sent home.  2 whole wards have been closed because they cannot staff them. Ambulances are queuing up outside because there aren't enough beds. Fuck off with your bullying shit. I'm not having it.

        <p>Yeah I picked a fight with someone who moaned about anxiety and depression (obvious badges of honour for many these days) because they had to wear a mask and society is locked down. So utterly pathetic. You are the one who felt it necessary to butt in with another mindless comment. This whole sub is hundreds of people throwing tantrums-that's it's sole purpose, so what?

        <p>Humans can only truly trust and respect a few dozen to a few hundred social contacts. This requires a certain degree of shared values, what you might call an echo chamber. The number of people on this sub might be beyond an individual's social limit, and our "one big society" most certainly is, but echo chambers themselves aren't inherently a problem when limited to a small number of people. The problem is this expectation that thousands, millions, billions of people agree with each other and give a fuck about each other. Thankfully, such collectivism isn't sustainable.</p>

        <p>4th time in the grocery store with no mask. First 3 were within an hour of opening during the week so there weren't that many shoppers. Today though was more normal, busy but not super crowded. Nearly wore it in but decided to stick with the plan. Never had any issues from shoppers or staff. </p>
<p>I have noticed every time has gotten easier so if you're considering going without a mask that first step is the hardest. Going at a slower time helped me get over that block. Based on my experience I think most people are over the mask but are too scared to be the first to step up.</p>

        <p>Posted this elsewhere in the sub, but... This morning, someone I was talking to (in America, I assume) on another Reddit post, said that seeing more characters in a scene of her favourite tv show, at a time, than restrictions allow, makes her feel physically sick... Because it was filmed after the pandemic, and the situation is “so bad” in the US... 🙄</p>
<p>Health anxiety, fear and (probably, later) snitching on behalf of other people, because they may have flouted some arbitrary rule, WHILE FILMING A TV SHOW... 😤 That’s scary. Not the pandemic itself. That.</p>
<p>There’s no way that is a healthy way to live your life... :-/</p>

<p>I am exhausted of debating with doomers and they just end the conversation in “but the TV... But the OMS... But the pic i saw in whatsapp...” and that’s it. I don’t give a fuck anymore about these folks and i miss my life. I want it back. I like the fact that i can walk in street maskless without receiving weird looks and seeing more people maskless too. But the limitations of 20 people in some bars, the temperature checking like it matters, the fact that there’s a lot of business still closed in my city... It’s just so annoying and i hate seeing people blindly defend this shit.</p>

        <p>My day has only just started, and I am already pissed. I am at the gym right now, and I was minding my own business browsing the cafeteria looking for something to eat. Nobody else around, and a staff member comes out of nowhere to tell me that my half face mask is "no longer allowed". Even though my mouth and nose are completely covered, I need to wear a full face shield or a "regular mask". He did provide a cheap face shield, but I'm still mad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should never have given these assholes an inch. This isn't the first time I've heard of businesses mandating that only certain types of masks are allowed, either. Some places don't even allow face shields without another mask on underneath despite the fact that the shield covers more of the face than the face diaper. Tell me how it's not about control at this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People need to accept that other people have the right to breathe. If we were just allowed to open up and live like normal people, these special snowflakes would have had to concede. Instead, the more we cater to them, the more it's not enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really don't want to cancel my membership. On the one hand, enough is enough. On the other hand, I so don't want to be barred from everything either. Why can't more people just push back? We've gone from a country that would sue for a fart to one that won't protest for anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ETA: My half shield is good enough for the doctor's office, but apparently not good enough for when I'm not even interacting with anyone else. Go figure.</p>

        <p>Update: I have decided that if no one else will fight back then I will. I just sent a message to corporate with my contact information (and kept a copy for myself). I asked point blank when the policy changed and why I wasn't informed of it when I checked in. If it's not an official policy, then why are their managers taking it upon themselves to approach me like that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't imagine anyone will get back to me before the holidays, but I will be following up with them if they ignore me. I may need to find a more sensible gym, but I'm not going out without a fight. This gym had been acting like they're doing us a favor by being open. It's past time that someone let them know that <em>we</em> are the ones doing them a favor by giving them money, and we will be glad to give it to someone else if they can't treat us with common decency.</p>

        <p>How do you deal with a partner who isn't bothered all that much by it all? He says it's the price for participation in society right now, like wearing a shirt and shoes in a store. He fully agrees that it's stupid, that the mask does nothing, that the shutdowns were for naught and are damaging. He simply isn't as upset by the ridiculous situation as I am. The health/security theater wears me down and I feel totally alone.</p>

        <p>He might just be thinking more pragmatically about it is all. You said yourself that he agrees it’s all absurd, but maybe he feels like there just isn’t much he can do about it at the moment other than to keep moving on with his life as best he can. It sounds like you’re just upset that he’s not being as neurotic about it as you’d like. I know that probably comes off harsh but I don’t mean it that way at all. Different people react differently to situations. I’m no relationship expert by any means, but if I were you I would talk to him to try to get mutual understanding of where each of you are coming from. He might not get how hard of a time you’re having either.</p>

        <p>You're 100% right, thank you for this reframe. He's a homebody, I'm an extrovert who used to be a fitness instructor; I'm really mourning the life I had. He's fine with doing what he feels he needs to do, like putting on a mask to go into a business, even though he'd prefer not to. He sees it as not making a scene for the sake of making a scene. For me, it's a constant reminder of the fear mongering and how easy it all was to undo society as we knew it. Doesn't help that it's completely useless as well. That said, in our area, it's impossible to go in almost anywhere without one, and so I do it, too. C'est la vie, I only hope it's not forever.</p>

        <p>I get where you’re both coming from. I really hope all this theater ends ASAP. I think at this point we’re in a total sunk cost fallacy situation, where governors and other leaders shut down so hard early on (to little or no avail) that going back now would be an embarrassing admission that they were totally wrong. Politicians (and other public figures like Fauci) don’t exactly tend to be the most humble of people, and they got in too deep too fast to admit they were wrong now without major humiliation and political cost. If my state’s governor Newsom opened everything tomorrow, both sides would probably burn his house down. The doomers for not protecting them from the virus he’s been convincing them is the worst thing ever, and all the normal people for ruining their lives over nonsense.</p>

        <p>Fellow Californian! It's always nice to know we're not all doomers. At least in our situation, Newsom really hurt himself with that French Laundry stunt. That toll has yet to be paid and I believe it will kill his career in the long run. He clearly has  (had) aspirations of being president. That idiot-king Cuomo is another story...</p>
<p>In our area, we can more or less get by and do whatever we please. Businesses are staying open on the DL including gyms and indoor dining. It pisses me off that having a meal inside with a friend is a revolutionary act, but I also think this won't go on forever, and I try to stay positive.</p>

        <p>So what’s the solution then, do you think? I sincerely doubt that folks like us would get angry if everything opened up tomorrow, we’re at this point already and can’t reverse the damage. Best thing we can do now is open up.</p>

        <p>I’ll be relieved if things open, but I’ll still be angry just like I am now. I’d say the only real solution is to thoroughly trounce every pro lockdown politician in the ballot box, or to bring meaningful legal action against them. Let’s be honest, those are the only languages these people understand. They couldn’t care less that the little people like you and me can’t stand them, as long as their cushy seats of power and their bank accounts are secure.</p>

        <p>Maybe look into behavioral sink and the social cycle, explain why this "one big society" everyone goes on about is only dust in the wind, millions of smaller societies with different wants and needs that just-so-happen to be floating along the same breeze? I have no clue. My husband is more accepting of the mandates/restrictions than I am, but only so we don't draw too much unwanted attention before our living situation is more secure. He sees my anger as a waste of time and energy that can be spent on better things. Apparently that makes us "cowards" though, because picking battles wisely is akin to sucking dick if Daddy Government and Mommy Megacorporation say so.</p>

        <p>Haha, at least my husband would never go that far. We don't vote, we're very frugal with our trust and respect, we believe centralized power is inherently corrupt and big entities are inherently unstable. That's one of the first things we bonded over, before we ever even knew each other's names: those "not fit for a first date" topics of politics and philosophy, especially regarding our distrust of big business and big government.</p>

        <p>Is anyone else sick of the "hot takes" on social media about how people are scared to go back to normal because then they might have to hang out with other people again? </p>
<p>I wasn't the most social person in the before times either but when I turned down an invite, I act like an adult and say no thank you. I'm so sick of the people who think hiding in their house and being anti social is a personality trait. No one is stopping you from hiding in your house if things go back to normal. Stop acting scared that people will want to hang out with you after this is over. People most likely gave up on you a long time ago anyway.</p>

        <p>Quarantine is just outsourcing pain and suffering to the working class: an ironically extreme form of individualism, deciding that this year coping with an old or sick relative's death is no longer a pain you accept, and that a third party, mostly the working class, should bear the brunt of the pain. You destroy their communities and livelihoods so you can feel comfortable and safe. They suffer for you, an exchange. </p>
<p>We need to start saying it like this. We all feel off about the idea of transferring suffering to innocent people. It's natural to us, so it's hard to explain. But we have to be honest with people about this. You can sugarcoat it any way you like but at the end of the day this is what it is and this is what you support when you support this toxic view of transferring pain to others. Also Prof Sunetra Gupta is the best.</p>

        <p>I dunno if this has much discussion value, but I gotta get this off my chest. Lord Fauci the little demon who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYVB9IbSmxY">can't throw a baseball</a> to save his life is such a piece of shit I just can't believe people blindly trust this guy. He just looks plain evil to me, and the things he says and articles written about him, it's like he is the lord and "savior" of covid it pisses me off. "Dr. Fauci warns we might be in for a long winter" "Dr Fauci stated that vitamin C is healthy" like really dude? We needed this little goblin to tell us that an essential vitamin is healthy?!?</p>
<p>I feel like the world has lost its mind, but maybe they never had one at all. It's amazing to me  so many people gobble his shit up like its gospel.  I can't trust a guy who is so unhealthy and weak he throws a ball like <em>that.</em></p>

        <p>Yes, but also because I find it difficult to communicate with a mask. I think a big part of communication (for me at least) comes from facial expressions and lip reading which is obviously impossible to do with a mask. Plus I speak quite softly and being muffled doesn't help.</p>

        <p>Australia. It’s nowhere near as bad as that, however despite the fact that we have had something like 0.3% of the deaths you’ve had (probably less), and probably 0.05% of the case numbers, our restrictions can, at times and in places, be just as strict as you have, in some states... If not more so, in one or two states here recently...</p>
<p>It’s very weird. Everyone panics over 30 or 50 new cases. Everyone is fearful. No one dares question the media or government “party line”...
Honestly on anything. This is just the latest, very obvious, all-encompassing example. :-(</p>
<p>I try to talk about proportionality or reasonable reactions and responses, and how the relative scale of our outbreaks are minimal, but that just gets you yelled at, and potentially even loses you (some) friends...</p>

<p>People see like 10 cases in NSW and act like it's a plague pit. It's insanity and honestly I reckon maybe only 20% of people are seemingly aware this is bullshit.</p>
<p>You're not alone but honestly if I'm right we might as well be as these numbers are not good for challenging corona tyranny.</p>

        <p>Nah, Tassie.
I just posted that in the SA sub as I figured it was most relevant there, and r/Aus would have blocked it, ha (poorly written as it was).</p>
<p>But ah, in general my posts are... Less than fun. Sorry if you had to see all that, lol.</p>
<p>But yes, I agree. Though from a “libertarian” perspective, it’s interesting we can go from ruining lives over an issue like that, which was about “increasing personal freedoms”, to one like this, which is the exact opposite... :-/</p>
<p>But yeah, I agree. Have already experienced that to an extent. I rarely ever say anything on Facebook, about it, for that reason, and I certainly won’t be saying much about it around my... family, tomorrow. 😖</p>
<p>I guess, for me personally, the equivalent is when I dared to question the Uluru climbing ban... I literally got chased off Facebook, ha. Literally made a new account, because I got so much shit simply for saying (literally) “I disagree with this.”</p>
<p>So I get it, don’t worry... 😑</p>

<p>nearly 100% indoor mask compliance (except for the exceedingly rare sightings of completely maskless individuals, but all were appearing age 60+), and I'd say 75% for outdoors. (Went hiking one afternoon in October with my brother and 80% of hikers were masked... ridiculous. especially considering it was a <em>mountain</em> trail, strenuous physical activity!)</p>

        <p>I’m just frustrated that politics is just in my face everywhere. I’m visiting my parents and I went for a walk this evening in the liberal white upper-middle class neighborhood my family lives in and a third of the houses had BLM signs or the “in this house, we believe science is real, etc.” signs on their lawns. I’m just getting so sick of all the sanctimonious virtue signaling when it comes to politics and Covid. Can we just leave each other alone and live our lives how we want to without pushing politics into everyone’s face?</p>

<p>10 years ago, that was a perfectly normal, neutral thing to say. 20 years ago, 95% of people LIVED that way, without a second thought.</p>
<p>Now we live in a world of "if you're not with us, you're against us" kind of bullshit. People have become weaponized and radicalized against their own neighbors. Having extreme opinions is taken to be a sign of goodness and righteousness - again, to the point that widely held beliefs from 10-15 years ago are now considered 'right-wing extremism'.</p>
<p>And the deepest irony, is that the people most caught up in it all, were the same ones who desperately wanted religion out of the public life back then - they felt neocons had too much power, and their nightmare scenario was Dubya instituting some kind of 'Christian Caliphate'.</p>
<p>So of COURSE they end up with their own holy, unquestionable religion in our time: Church of the Woke / Anti-Racist / Holy SCIENCE! And just our luck, every last mainstream 'journalist' is 100% a convert.</p>

        <p>Same, it's absolutely everywhere and it's seriously annoying. Gaming sub? "My country is going into full lockdown from midnight and here's what I'll be doing" followed by a random cringy screenshot of the game. Hobbies subs? "My quarantine project", "Taught myself to &lt;x&rt; during lockdown", "Great time to get into &lt;y&rt;". I used to enjoy using the ipad/ipad pro subs to learn new tips and see creative uses for the tech. Now it's just bombarded with people circle-jerking over their WFH setups. </p>
<p>I hate this language because they're using "lockdown" in the same way that they'd use something like "school holidays" or "summer break". It's just become like another season or something.</p>

        <p>Same bro. For the first time I’m living alone. I can either grind endlessly for paycheck to paycheck or grind  a sales job for wealth. I’m ready for a big-boy job and a big paycheck, and to finally support myself. The only thing holding me back is the fake fear, and depression, but shit, I’m on the verge of being able to support myself and even buy gifts for others. Once I land a gig I can hustle and prosper. It just seems so distant, the mental fog and all the psy pps are really taking it’s toll when in reality we’re all on the verge of success here in America</p>

        <p>I have one still but I keep a parental control in my settings that makes me physically have to unblock it to actually use it. Prevents me from mindlessly scrolling and opening an app. I also deleted the app on my phone and installed two ad blockers, so no more giving them ad money. Lastly, I deleted a lot of people this year and unfollowed a bunch as well. It’s to me becoming a useless time wasting platform, imo.</p>

        <p>Very strange correlation seems to be present among people in r/Waiting_to_Wed who are also frightened by COVID. Which they have every right to be, just an interesting crossover - many of them are afraid to go to a nail salon. Interesting that someone who is extremely fearful of rona also happens to be a doormat in their relationship and unwilling to leave a crappy partner.</p>

        <p>My roommate woke up with a fever on Saturday and got tested for Covid on Monday with a positive result. I went to get tested because I can’t go back to work or celebrate Christmas with my family if I don’t, and my result was negative. I feel fine. No symptoms. We share a kitchen and a bathroom. A ton of people from her work got it, but not as bad as she did. She sanitizes everything and uses antibacterial after going into any store. She’s obsessive about mask wearing. Meanwhile I continue to wash my hands my normal amount, wear a mask only when I absolutely have to, and keep living my life. I have to get tested again next week before I can go back to work (I work as a nanny so I don’t wear a mask at work, thank God). I think I either already had it (I was really sick in January and thought it was just the flu) or my body has fought it off because I take vitamins and don’t obsess over cleanliness. She is missing Christmas with her family, even though her fever broke days ago. She said that she has to quarantine like covid is a death sentence and not a normal sickness. She won’t take mucinex for her cough because she’s “not sure if she’s supposed to”. What?! If I have shit in my lungs and I’m coughing, I take it because it breaks it up and gets it out of my system faster. I’ve done my due diligence by getting tested. I’m not sitting here for two weeks. If I’m not sick, I can’t spread anything. Where did that logic go? Why is everyone so terrified of something that has a really good survival rate? Sure having a fever and aches and a cough is terrible, but for most people it’s not a death sentence. </p>
<p>Someone at her work said, “if you got it, there’s no hope for the rest of us” because she is so into sanitizing and cleaning. I think she’s killed her immune system by getting rid of all the germs, but I won’t tell her that. She thinks she’s high and mighty because she is so good at cleaning and keeping things pristine. It’s a little annoying. I pet my cats while I eat. I don’t use a lot of hand sanitizer. I don’t lick doorknobs. What else can you do? Your body has to remember how to fight germs. She is super deep into drinking the kool-aid,though, and is convinced she will kill someone if she goes outside. Now I have to get tested again to be sure I don’t have a glorified cold/flu hybrid to make everyone feel better. I mean the testing is not bad, but no one makes you get tested for the flu multiple times. I’ve showed up to tons of places with a cold so I wouldn’t lose a job. I just take meds and go on with it. I showed up to a temp job with the flu (undiagnosed) for three days because i didn’t want to lose my job. I just kept drinking tea and swallowing ibuprofen. By the time I finally got tested, I was almost on the other side and everyone was so amazed at how quickly I recovered. How do you nicely point out that capitalism is king and I was worried about calling out and losing my job? America went from not giving a shit about sick employees to reacting over the top about it. </p>
<p>This was just kind of a stream of consciousness rant so I can get these thoughts outside of my brain. If you made it through this, thanks for reading.</p>

        <p>I do Instacart and I’ve been doing it since May. I’ve gone to stores hundreds of times and been around thousands of people. What pisses me tf off is when a Karen is there and I’m five feet away from her and she starts backing away and giving me dirty looks to show that I’m too close to her. Some customers won’t even open the door for me when I arrive to scan their ID for alcohol, they press their ID against the glass and I have to scan it from there.

<p>Well, I recently was told what I had in mind has a high survival rate, so it seems it's pointless to bother with it.</p>

        <p>Well my wife got sent home from work because she tested positive. Now she's fine, just has the sniffles. But she made the mistake of telling her mom, the biggest hypochondriac on earth, she has it. Now I get to hear about how Im acting irresponsible and am responsible for her getting sick because my position on everything Covid is essentially "fuck this and fuck you for suggesting it". I'm really losing my cool with the in-laws. I really feel this year has brought out the worst in me lately. I just can't respect someone who's bought in this much and is this much of a mindless drone.</p>

        <p>I've seen more people get injured from auto accidents this year than get sick from this virus.</p>
<p>I was hit by a bus in November, friend of mine was run over as she was crossing the street (broke her right arm), different friend was hospitalized for an accident in September, and I've seen multiple accidents in my city or near my job (including today!) as I'm passing by.</p>
<p>I remember when I had my accident, one of the officers asked if I was doing Uber or Lyft because "they always have accidents". Yes, there have been so many accidents, it's considered a casual thing now.</p>
<p>But the virus is supposed to be the scariest thing ever? Let's see: sick in bed for a weekend or a week (most likely) vs getting my bones smashed or killed instantly. Yeah, I think I know where I'd rather take my chances.</p>
<p>And, sadly, someone was injured in the accident near my job today. The road is now blocked off. Hopefully, the person (or people) recover.</p>

        <p>Anyone else feel like Biden is preparing us for something horrible when he takes office? He keeps talking about the long dark winter and how it’s going to get worse before it gets better.  I mean how much worse can it get? He really can’t call for a national lockdown or even a mask “mandate”. I guess he can threaten states and municipalities w money but he doesn’t he have that power.   He HAS to turn this thing around by Like mid February In order for his party to look good for the primaries.  I guess he can force states to close down again?</p>

<p>I don't feel like <strong>he</strong> is doing anything, he seems maybe 85% lucid even on his good days. Now the puppetmasters around him, however ...</p>
<p>The 'Dark Winter' stuff is definitely ominous. But it could end up just being a way to mentally condition everybody to feel a collective national orgasm when he (maybe) takes office and completes the first 100 days. "Look what we did!" as they start enforcing strict PCR cycle limits, ramping down hysteria across all media in lockstep, etc.</p>

        <p>He definitely has no authority to institute a nationwide lockdown and doing that would very quickly cripple the country and I think even they know it. My guess is the most he can do to mandate masks and coerce individual states into imposing stricter measures is threaten to withhold federal funding, but it would most likely be challenged in court for being blatantly unconstitutional and is unlikely to go through with a divided government. Unfortunately states with Democrat governors are already under quite a bit of restrictions and so many already have mask mandates in place which makes it a miserable experience for anyone stuck living there and surrounded by masked morons.</p>

<p>He could try it, but it would probably get ugly since half the citizens are armed to the level of a standing military, and it's the side that hates him. And that side also includes the police and military who'd need to be used to enforce these measures.</p>

<p>I try not to entertain conspiracy theories, partially because I like to think our leaders are too stupid to conspire and partially so I'm not lumped in with the "demon alien lizard people" crowd. But I just can't help but find this all a tad suspicious.</p>

        <p>Admins, just a suggestion:</p>
<p>You might want to conspicuously link to the previous weekly thread in the post above (sure, it can be found by looking at the bot's post history, but not everyone immediately thinks to do that). That way comments that were posted at the tail end of the weekly period will still get some eyeballs / replies.</p>

        <p>I've talked on here before about my frustrations but today is a positive post: I've made plans to move to another state (which is more open than my current one) and go back to uni for a postgrad degree, since they are offering in-person instruction. Sick of working from home so it's time to try something new. I'm tired of waiting for the world to reopen - in 2021 I'm doing something different. Nothing ventured, nothing gained!</p>

        <p>I finally got an answer from my medical examination, which was delayed. I wasn't too happy about it. It was a hearing test.</p>
<p>In one way I'm glad my doctor said I had fine hearing, but at the same time I hoped for a diagnosis to get rights without it actually getting worse. Now I've no right getting writing interpreters, sign language interpreters (if I learn it), better microphones or teachers showing their damn face. Some teachers and students will wear clear masks because of I complained, but they're not required to show their lips by law without a diagnosis. I'm bloody mad over that because of I don't know how long the new normal would last and if people would keep doing the bs for years after getting the shot.</p>
<p>If <em>everyone</em> choose to cover their face after the mandate is over, it's their choice. But I don't think it's fair I've to deal with other's bs in school and work situations. I should've right on equally good access to information and quality like everyone else.</p>

        <p>Well I was just banned from r/Coronavirus for commenting that while unlikely to be the case, it is not 100% certain that the vaccine will remain effective against any particular antigen mutation...lol what a censored load of horsesh*t that sub is. FWIW I'm a PhD scientist who works with proteins day in and day out, as well as evolutionary genomics and linking mutation genotypes to phenotypes - which is probably more than you can say for the mods - but it is apparently "fear mongering" to spread the slightest doubt about vaccine effectiveness there even when the statement that we don't know for absolute sure is the truth. I'm still awaiting my vaccination eagerly as it's &rt;99% chance still likely to be effective after a few coding mutations, and we have no other choice to attempt to escape this hell obviously.</p>
<p>Closely watching the Moderna roll out and trying to see if our weekly vaccination numbers go up because they need to - dramatically. Has anyone found an actual source of this info? NY Times has a useless vaccine tracker where they attempted to survey each state and got no collective answer from California. What a disaster.</p>

        <p>“I use big words. Please think I’m credible.” Truth is the vaccine will induce a polyclonal antibody response. There’s no reason to believe that a couple amino acid substitutions will change the efficacy. Spreading bullshit online is stupid and referring to yourself as a “PhD scientist” is hilarious</p>

        <p>The thing is, people on both sides (masks &amp; anti-masks) just want to be left alone and live their lives like they used to. Nobody actually <strong>wanted/wants</strong> a "new normal". The divide is due to the thought process on how to go back to the old ways due to Covid.</p>
<p>Anti-masks just want to live their life how they've always lived it, and they don't want to be told what to do, so they're doing what they want to do and not wearing a mask. Mask wearers also want to live their life how they've always lived it, but are following worldwide health advice so they're not stuck in this "new normal" for even longer. Whether or not people on this sub accept it, there IS a new normal, and it's something they can't control. Even if you never wear a mask and carry on, stores are requiring masks and even full-on lockdowns are happening, so even if they manage to not get Covid directly, anti-masks can't help being negatively affected by Covid too, so they're not exactly "living their lives like they used to".</p>
<p>Sometimes people don't realise that nobody likes the idea of a new normal, because a health issue has turned into a political one, when it should be a common sense one. If you're driving a car, and the car rams into a wall, the car stops. If you wear a mask and you cough, yes, some of your germs manage to get through the mask, but some of it hits that wall and stops, which means there's less of it around and it lowers the odds you pass it on to anyone else. Now, the more that these germs are hitting the wall in people's masks, the less of it is passing around from person to person, which would result in less people getting sick, which then results in less people being able to pass it on, the statistics will decrease and the government will ease the restrictions on people from living their life the way they used to. By avoiding wearing masks, for whatever your reason is, all you end up doing is prolonging how long this shitty "new normal" is.</p>
<p>We all want to go back to how it was before, and realistically, the only way we can do that as soon as possible is by doing everything in our power to lower the numbers. Not by pretending it doesn't exist, claiming it's a hoax, or doing whatever else that directly or indirectly raises the numbers.</p>

        <p>Stop pretending this is a pandemic. Fewer than one tenth of one percent of the population has supposedly died in 10 months. If you believe the government, then you have to also believe their statistics. Why are you scared?</p>

        <p>The fact you say 'supposedly died' already shows you don't believe that number, so I don't know how much point there is going into it.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, saying "fewer than one tenth of one percent of the population" is a very roundabout way of saying nearly 340,000 people have died in the US alone. It's crazy to me how much apathy there is for these people, especially when many of these same apathetic people wanted to go to war over 9/11, which coincidentally had less than 1% of the deaths that Covid has had, or if you want to talk about the entire US population, then fewer than one tenth of one percent of one percent of the population. Making the number look small doesn't mean anything when the numbers are people's lives, and it doesn't even acknowledge the way that the loss of life can affect the deceased person's families.   </p>
<p>Also, people calling others scared for trying to save lives by wearing a mask, which is nothing more than a minor inconvenience, is a bit backwards ain't it? Especially when, again, a lot of these people who call others scared for wearing a mask, are the same ones who are 'scared' of having an injection. Stop trying to pretend one side is brave and the other is scared, it's the same thing as the divide of left and right. If you put all that bs aside, all it comes down to is that people should be wanting to help others not die, just as you should expect others to try and help you or your loved ones not die. That's it.</p>

<p>Well problem A here is you're assuming it's due to a lack of caring. Elderly and other high risk people may be extremely bothered to take care of themselves, but they're still high risk. If you get Covid and you're going around not socially distancing and maskless (i.e. "making your own decisions"), you can pass it onto others, even if they are trying to take every precaution possible. Doing all the precautions just minimizes the chances of getting it, it doesn't make you immune, which is why it's better when more people are doing it. </p>
<p>You can make your own decisions, but you should at least see why some people would call this selfish, right? If it was a matter that only people who didn't take precautions could get it, then a lot less people would care if you wanted to go around maskless, because you'd only be risking yourself in the end.</p>

        <p>I don’t think you realize how many people that is. And how many more have long term/permanent injury from COVID19 complications. Not all death is preventable but controlling a dangerous pathogen is absolutely action we need to take to prevent easily preventable deaths. I guess by your logic we shouldn’t bother fighting or treating any human disease </p>
<p>And you don’t understand the insidious nature of exponential growth do you? it catches you by surprise quickly. Millions of people are catching COVID19 with many being at high risk of death or injury.

        <p>Not all death is preventable, but we already have many preventions in place to minimize the amount of deaths other causes have.

        <p>Well I’m definitely glad you’re wearing a mask. But all other COVID19 measures need to be adhered to since masks are one imperfect layer of the COVID19 response.</p>
<p>Honestly a national plan was needed with advisors for each state to tailor the plans rather than leaving the measures in the hands of governors with no disease management experience. One state can ruin the progress of all others. Florida is absolutely screwing up its management of COVID19 thanks to their insufferable state government</p>

<p>Hahahahahahaha!!!!</p>
<p>My job is Amazon!! Care? Amazon? Really?! That's a good one!!</p>
<p>I had to go to work <em>the very night after my auto accident</em> because I couldn't get time off and paid medical leave doesn't exist, even with a doctor's notice. Thankfully, I didn't break any bones, but the pain didn't go away for a week.</p>
<p>They uninstalled the metal detectors and xray machines to "encourage social distancing", and only reinstalled them at one location after a shooting occurred.</p>
<p>There was an outage that resulted in the building having absolutely no running water. Employees had to take a shuttle to another location to use the restroom and come back. All of the machines were down and/or jammed, and in no way safe to use. Yet we weren't allowed to go home.</p>
<p>And that's, of course, not counting the number of injuries that happen normally (if I had a dime for every time a package has almost hit me in the head).</p>
<p>This is the company that tried to cover up the death of an employee who was killed by a forklift.</p>
<p>You're really claiming this company cares about its community and public health? <em>Seriously?!</em></p>
<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>On the bright side, thank you for continuing to prove my point nobody gives a damn about anything that's not COVID-19. Oh, but they give us candy and "swag" once in a while, so they totally care! /s</p>
<p>Ah, that was a good one.</p>

<p>Mom: I've basically given up trying to reason with her. She genuinely and truly believes every word from the "experts" like Fraudci or Pedo Joe/Her Imperial Wokeness and would probably turn me into any "health" Stasi genuinely believing it was for my own good if said "experts" said so.</p>
<p>Dad: A smart-ass comment about the new abnormal and its inconsistencies every now and again seems to work with him for at least starting a conversation/getting him to think a little bit.</p>
<p>Brother: Just don't talk about anything new abnormal related with him, since a certain sitting congresswoman encouraged her zealot commie followers to make lists of Trumpist "collaborators" for...they just want to sit down for a cup of tea, I'm sure. My brother and his Reddit comrades, fall under that umbrella.</p>

        <p>Exactly! So we’re our own masters unless we’re enslaved. </p>
<p>That’s individual sovereignty, meaning, I govern and have authority over myself. This is how we identify and grow. If someone else is trying to govern you and your opinion, your ownership of yourself is being threatened. Some of us may or may not believe that is happening. 
But understanding the concept is much more important, so I would hope that my perspective could be valuable to you. As yours is valuable to me.</p>

Doesn’t matter if those rules are religion based, societal based, racist based or just culture based and if you don’t follow their rules you are wrong.

He, his wife, and 3 young kids show up in masks and are the only ones in the damn park wearing them. He later cautioned us against the zoo because "only 20% of people there wear masks."

<li>
<p>I was allowed to go to a beach in FL over Labor Day weekend.  (Duh, no one is going to be wearing a mask at the beach) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last month, I was not allowed to go across the country with my wife, to attend the funeral of her grandmother. (They asked if I was close to her. It shouldn't matter, I am also there to comfort my wife!) They also asked if my wife would still be going. Nah she's just going  to skip her grandma's funeral, her shining example and huge influence in her life. TRAVEL DENIED.
Meanwhile, my BIL's wife who is also USAF, was authorized travel, and I don't think she had even met Grandma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also tried attending an OUTDOOR event with my wife in another state, with strict mask and testing requirements. City restrictions were also affecting attendance to the event. (Using last year's attendance, which we were a part of, approx 35k, each person would have approx 30 ft between them and the next person if they were evenly spaced out across the area.) I had included in my travel request I would be following all local guidelines. TRAVEL DENIED. Her dad meets her there for the event.
When I was told it was denied, I told them I would just go to the much smaller event but the same organization that's down the road(ten minutes) from where I live (my house is an hour from base), to which they replied "just make sure you send a travel request up" yeah, right.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether I went or not, I'd be getting the Chi-Coughs, because they can't tell me I can't kiss my wife.</p>

        <p>I hate that any criticism to lockdown is taken as I’m some sort of Covid denier “science hater”. </p>
<p>Where were all these life is sacred people before this? No one cared about the immunocompromised before this.. </p>
<p>I wear my mask every time I’m in public because at worst I’m wearing a piece of cloth on my face at best “I’m Saving a life”.</p>
<p>I work at an insurance company with retirement accounts. I see every single day how badly this has effected people. Our call volumes are up 30 percent higher than last year. People are cashing out their retirement accounts their life savings. I have people crying to me on the phones. By June/July we were having 5-10 plans a day contacting us to start the plan termination process. These aren’t “small” businesses they are at least big enough to afford to pay for 401(k)s. </p>
<p>Kids need to be around other kids. Don’t get me started on trying to date right now.</p>

        <p>Ugh my region is expected to announce lockdown 2.0 starting on Christmas eve and it's supposed to be "28 days". Lol, i'll believe that when I see it.</p>
<p>And for some weird reason I STILL see people on the sub for my region supporting it! All I have to wonder is... Why? There's been public research released that shows where COVID-19 primarily spreads in my area... And besides LTC homes, it's in meat packing plants, shipping and fulfillment warehouses and other highly employed workplaces... All of which are exempt from lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>This lockdown will literally do NOTHING to stop the spread since the bulk of COVID-19 spread in my area isn't within the community, and is almost exclusively in the aforementioned industries... So when the 28 days is up, the numbers will as expected not have declined at all and the government will just go "oh well gotta keep the restrictions in place".</p>
<p>Like, again, THIS INFO IS OUT THERE. This isn't like back in March where we were still figuring out where and how COVID spread... This info is publicly available that shows COVID is primarily spreading in meat plants, factories and highly employed warehouses and NOT in restaurants, gyms, hair salons and all the 'non-essential' places... Again, ALL of which are EXEMPT from lockdown restrictions. So why is no one questioning whether these restrictions on the community will work?</p>
<p>They won't. Since the main spreading vectors of COVID are exempt from the lockdown restrictions, the numbers will continue to climb throughout the lockdown. All that this lockdown is doing, is punishing us since community activity isn't spreading this thing like crazy. It's just so fucking mind boggling I really have to pinch myself to remember this is really fucking happening and not a massive joke.</p>

        <p>We usually don't lock posts, but that Jess post was a rare exception.  I thought that the original post was a pretty good one, but there was so much trolling and incivility on that comment thread that I locked it while I was cleaning it up, to prevent more goings-on while I cleaned it up.  Then once I was done, I realized that I had removed more than half of the comments for trolling and/or feeding the trolls.  I also determined that if I reopened the comments, it would just resume, and we would have to go on another cleanup spree on there.  So the post stayed locked, and I said as much in a modpost on there.</p>

        <p>I just want to vent/rant. I don't watch TV at all. I sometimes stream movies, but mostly I do watch documentaries that interest me. I haven't seen commercials or mainstream news channels in about a year, with exceptions to short clips posted on this or other groups, usually making fun of how stupid is their narrative. </p>
<p>I came back home for Christmas to visit my grandparents. Their TV is usually on a 24h news channel. I was horrified to see the amount of propaganda they have there. First of all, they play this spot made by the Polish Ministry of Health every commercial break: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hEzDGrbXdo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hEzDGrbXdo</a></p>
<p>It is in Polish, but goes more or less like this: young guy thinks he has little chance of dying from COVID so he does not wear a mask, also he thinks they do not offer protection, his friends don't wear them as well. Last scene he is getting hooked up to a respirator in a hospital bed. "Wear a mask of you will wear a respirator (mask)".</p>
<p>Yes, this spot is very primitive propaganda, something I would expect coming from the Polish Government. It did annoy me, and I guess not only me since they disabled comments on youtube and as I am writing this post, but it also has about 1k upvotes and 2k downvotes.</p>
<p>Much worst was the thing I saw on mainstream "news" the whole day. It is all about COVID and vaccine. Nothing else is going on in the world, nothing to report, only about how the vaccine is on the way and we all need to get it. Do you wonder how you can fill all day with one piece of information? Let's watch the video of the vaccine leaving the lab in Belgium on its way to Poland. Let's talk to an expert about how amazing it is they made it so fast! Let's talk with a nurse who will be the first one to get the injection. Let's hear from the EU leader about the vaccine. Let's see how they transport it, what containers and what trucks are being used. Let's learn about the government vaccination plan and schedule. Let's listen to a professor who will tell you how safe vaccines are and that you should not listen to people online.</p>
<p>Yes - it is ridiculous, but we know it. I realized that it is the only source of information for many people like my grandparents. If they don't go online, or go online just to visit mainstream sites, they will not realize how much propaganda they consume. I start to understand the degree to which the maskers are brainwashed. This is scary as fuck.</p>

        <p>A "life on hold" is the same as not being alive. Would the doomers be happy to live to 150 if they spent their remaining years in a medically induced coma? I'd love to know (my guess is that they wouldn't). But there are many people right now who, if given the option, would happily be put into a coma for the next 6months/year/however long until this ends, just to spare the mental anguish of lockdown.</p>

        <p>My friend went to the local mall and this was her experience: stores had to limit to 10 people and everyone else had to wait in lines in the mall (which is fully indoors).  So instead of going to the mall and spending 30 minutes shopping she had to wait for over an hour to enter the store.  If the virus spreads by spending long periods indoors...why force people to spend more time in the mall?</p>

        <p>Was at a mall the other day...restrictions are just crazy. One store has mandatory masks and a huge line at the door with security guards, other stores are just business as normal. Stores of similar sizes have different occupancy limits (which are mostly ignored). So if I want to buy a phone from one store I have to wear a mask and wait in line for half an hour, if I want to buy from another store I can just waltz in. Yet customers are still going to the first place...</p>

        <p>Just need to quickly rant about another stupid restriction that makes zero sense... Big box stores blocking off 'non-essential item' aisles to customers... Why?</p>
<p>First off, closing off aisles lowers the amount of space in the stores customers have to spread out into... Meaning more people will be clustered together in the main aisles. AKA - COVID spreading zone.</p>
<p>Next, just why? What does not allowing customers to purchase non-essential items do? This will not help even the playing field for small businesses since they're closed and not allowed to open. Plus the customers are already in the store... So all you're doing is inconveniencing the customer, costing the business potential profit, limiting the area customers can spread out AND causing the employees stress since they'll be having customers bitching at them all day and berating them for having the aisles closed.</p>
<p>Like most restrictions amidst this pandemic, this one makes zero sense. Literally zero sense. So fucking stupid.</p>

        <p>I get that. But it just makes zero sense based on what "the experts" say. Like, wouldn't you want as much of the store open not just to sell merchandise, but to space customers out and allow them to social distance? So fucking stupid.</p>

        <p>no because it's all about control and fear mongering. People who are unhappy in their jobs/lives like feeling some power and being able to dictate to people. 
The idea is also to get people to buy everything online, so businesses that aren't like amazon go out of business &amp; there's also an excuse for a recession that's been coming since 2008 anyway.</p>

        <p>So I know that masks don't work and neither does social distancing. But common sense and forethought are still important. A friend from my old city, Chicago, went to the hospital last week complaining about his ear. They told him that he had an ear infection, but they sent him home with nothing, not even a prescription. Now I heard that he came down with the covid and went to the hospital again, this time in an ambulance on Christmas Eve. Gee, you think that you could have sent a totally blind man home with a prescription for his ear infection so he doesn't wind up deaf and blind? Or will he be treated well now that he has covid? This all could have been avoided, IMHO. Get medical staff to say, hey, here's an individual who needs my attention. Don't be a sloppy doctor.</p>

        <p>Gee, I was in the hospital on Wednesday all day for a personal reason. I had my nose and mouth covered the whole time. Now I am stuck at home with the virus. I will admit that a whole lot of people were not socially distant from me, but masks should go in the garbage. And on January 13 I should be able to get out of quarantine and work on getting all the paychecks I will have missed. But no, no, masks work. It's masks that keep us all safe. Hull of baloney!</p>

        <p>I don't know how much more I can take. It feels like everyone around me is a mindless zombie, parrotting phrases they've heard on TV / media without even so much as a thought about how mad it actually sounds. Friends saying "people complaining about restrictions, grow the f up" on social media, while me and my partner are having to shut our shop with no fiancial support and crammed into a tiny basement flat. It really feels like no one cares about us anymore and people, even friends, actively want to rub salt into wounds for absolutely no good reason at all. Everyone is now "selfish" for wanting to reclaim the most <em>basic</em> of human rights. </p>
<p>It really feels like there's no end in sight. First it was "2 weeks", then 3 months, then Christmas, now.. fuck knows. People are saying 2021 will be just as bad. Thoughts of death are constant again now.</p>

        <p>People first started panicking about the stupid bat flu at this time last year. Why aren't they tired of it yet?! And they're going "just until a vaccine, just another 6 months, just another year" blah blah blah. It's ridiculous, I really feel like there will be a new normal now and it's depressing, you can't escape it no matter where you go, even if places are somewhat open they're always threatening to close again. I'm sorry about your shop. You're not selfish for wanting to earn an honest living, and don't let anyone make you feel that way.</p>

        <p>&rt;Friends saying "people complaining about restrictions, grow the f up" on social media, while me and my partner are having to shut our shop with no fiancial support and crammed into a tiny basement flat.</p>
<p>I'm not asking you to do this, however, have you actually confronted them with this reality?</p>
<p>Because maybe they're in denial, and they don't know someone who is going through this.</p>
<p>A lot of people we call "Doomers", I think, disingenuously like to say that people like us are treating COVID like a hoax.  Well, it's probably because the way people are reacting are disproportionate to what we are actually seeing.</p>
<p>If they don't see a real person having the problems you are, maybe they just don't think those people are real, or the ones that are, are easily dismissed as whatever political strawman that they deem appropriate to prop up their views.</p>

        <p>New to this sub. I don't understand what you guys are saying? Please enlighten me. Is it that the gov will never put an end to these lockdowns? I see that my region is going into lockdown and we've only had 30 cases perday with no deaths for a little over 1million people.  I felt this was pretty unjustified because it doesn't feel as though we were in a terrible place to begin with. There was a lot of talk about how we were going to the lowest level of restriction and out of nowhere we are going to the highest level.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's about population control, at least not in the sense of reducing the population. If so, they're doing a terrible job, and most folks I've encountered who support the restrictions/mandates believe overpopulation is a myth. That's why they think all the elderly/infirm people should be kept alive forever. However, the goal does seem to be controlling the population for one reason or another. Seems our leaders are starting to fear what we could do if not kept on a tight leash.</p>

        <p>Walk back some months and read on. There's an overlap with cоnspiracy but most here are fed up with the totalitarian way they run the show. No innovation. E.g. where I live they could have charged 10 bucks per ski ticket and funded additional ICU/some beds in apline hospitals but they didn't. Now some Cantons shut down. Why? In 2018 two of these Cantons had to defer patients out of the inner region because of the flu. Nobody remembers. No new normal!<br>

        <p>Yes, it's valid in that we don't know for certain the long term effects of anything that we do. But that also isn't a reason to worry. Also, the people panicking about long chinavirus are almost all people who happily stuff their faces with fast food, smoke, drink, take drugs, drive too fast, etc etc etc. They willingly risk negative health outcomes for short term pleasure or convenience in so many other aspects of life. Why should we flip the logic for one stupid flu?!?</p>

        <p>I've had enough of this "everyone is equal" bullcrap. No, we are not all equal. I'm not going to pretend otherwise, I think I am a highly valuable person and my life is worth more than (some) other people's. Almost everyone would admit that they think they are superior to (say) a serial killer or pedophile, because such a person brings huge negative value to society. Many of the doomers out there feel like they're superior to, say, a McDonalds worker, or a delivery driver, or a disabled person. I've had enough of them acting like we're all equal when firstly it's not true, and secondly they don't practice what they preach. They are dragging people down to their level to make us all equal, instead of trying to better themselves and improve their own lives.</p>

        <p>This is so prevalent on Reddit where weaknesses and diseases like obesity and depression are to be glorified and encouraged because "we don't want anyone feel left out" even though they are the result of their own bad life choices. Instead of encouraging people to improve themselves they encouraging people to wallow in their own shit.</p>

        <p>&rt;Well you just had a panic attack and cried about a wearing a mask. </p>
<p>How compassionate of you.</p>
<p>Do you understand that you're probably going to see a lot more of this because masks are consistent reminder of at least a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>That people are still quite nervous about this and</li>
<li>That people have, for a sustained period of time, have been seeing each other as "threats".  </li>
</ol>
<p>And you think that isn't any cause for concern among normal people?  Let alone people who are depressed or who suffered from trauma or who have disabilities (such as deafness) that are impaired by wide-scale mask wearing?  </p>
<p>I don't know what the hell your problem is, but I hope you don't tell people about your "empathy" and "compassion", because you aren't one of those people.</p>

        <p>Venting. I'm planning drinks with a couple of other people - our kids hang out all the time, inside and maskless. But noooo, we ADULTS have to meet on a patio in the literally freezing weather, because they are too scared to meet indoors. We could drive 10 minutes to a county that allows comfortable, ventilated, and "safe" indoor dining rather than lowering our immune system by sitting outside with icicles hanging off of us. So damn ridiculous. And our kids are hanging out together indoors right now!! Make it make sense!!</p>

<p>6 people go out to dinner on the same night.
Two have had dose one of the vaccine.
One finds out they are positive two days later.</p>
<p>Would you assume that if the six people, minus the sick one, have already been exposed, and thus spending time with each other a few days later wouldn’t in the scheme of things really matter? Doesn’t the vaccine have to be given in both doses to actually protect you?</p>

        <p>I’m finding it impossible to keep it together anymore.</p>
<p>I’ve been depressed but functional for about 10 years. I’m coming to a point where I am wishing I wouldn’t wake up some days. I don’t know what to do, where to go to relieve some stress, or anything. </p>
<p>I just feel like life is losing meaning and purpose. My family Christmas got cancelled because of the concerns of some family members. I might not have all of these family members next year due to age. It might have been our last Christmas.</p>
<p>I kind of lost it yesterday. I went to the gym and started running, but I didn’t feel anything. I tried intervals, and didn’t feel tired. I just felt mentally exhausted. I sat in my car for 30 minutes before leaving because I didn’t want to go home and have to face the next few days.</p>
<p>I don’t know if anyone can relate, but I’ve been trying to put on a brave face for 8 months while I’m mentally falling apart. My brand new marriage has been challenged in ways I never expected. I’m always worried about the future now, and if we will ever have anything to go back to. </p>
<p>It seems no one is ever going to recognize what lockdowns and mandates have done to mental health.</p>

        <p>So my dad and I without explaining the complexity of our history have spent some time together at the start of the year and now a couple of times at the end and holy shit is it nice to have real intelligent conversations over a variety of topics and have some nuance and debate over it all. Very refreshing. Plus since xmas here in Victoria Australia I've seen a big difference in going back to pre covid normal. People seem to be waking up here.</p>

I knew that my aunt had a house located in baboon valley. The neighbor allegedly died when she saw a ghost.</p>
<p>Scenario2:
My friend’s girlfriend is a nurse at an elderly house and witnessed someone died of COVID.</p>

        <p>Hi, is this sub about anti everything? Like just let the virus do it’s thing? That’s the vibe I’m getting but wasn’t sure. It just seems to me that know one knows what to do, there’s lots conflicting info and false info out there. many people  want to still shop, or hang with friends, believe it’s a hoax or be a germophobe so they use whatever Info they can find to support that rather than finding reliable info and then making decisions. Do you find that’s true?</p>

        <p>Humans evolved for social groups of no more than a few hundred. You shouldn't expect a sub of 20,000 to be united under one set of ideals, and you certainly shouldn't expect a nation of millions or a world of billions to have the same wants and needs. Some people here support mask mandates or mandatory vaccination so long as businesses are allowed to reopen, some people oppose all COVID mandates/restrictions and believe individuals should take their own precautions if they so choose, some people believe even voluntary masks and voluntary vaccines should be banned. Some people do indeed believe COVID is a hoax, some believe the virus is a very real but very mild bioweapon, while some believe this is a naturally occuring pandemic that governments and corporations around the world are taking advantage of. Me personally? I oppose all mandates/restrictions and believe any responsibility for your own health/safety should be on you.</p>

        <p>&rt;whatever Info they can find to support that rather than finding reliable info and then making decisions.</p>
<p>As stated by u/Greasy007, r/LockdownSkepticism has a lot more direct info and data, but the whole idea behind that sub and this one is actually very much people who have watched the news and then <em>looked up the data</em> and realized the news was twisting the data in certain ways...so actually it's people finding all data and then making a decision, rather than just looking at one perspective (the media's) and making a decision on what to believe from that. </p>
<p>This sub specifically (vs the other one) talks to the idea that we should not be using this tragedy to build "a new normal" where we deprive children of the ability to learn and see faces, rush vaccines through/around medical trials, allow governments to shut down businesses/industries for any reason, the loss of support for people around the world not privileged enough to shut out the world and WFH making everyone cater to them, and all lack of due process. </p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the virus being a hoax, and everything to do with what the potential impacts could be of us allowing the government this much control in the name of "the new normal" and how that might dovetail into totalitarian (or any other sort of dictator-like) control of this country's freedoms.</p>

        <p>Thats down to the individual. Im personally fine with stores limiting people inside, closing, people wearing masks, distancing, or whatever else. As long as it is voluntary. Not forced by government. This subreddit appears to be more based around being anti-newnormal which is the idea that we will always be locked down, that small businesses will die and we will be stuck with megacorps, that masks and social distancing will be forever, etc. Anything passed that is down to the individual you speak to.</p>

<p>Look at pence getting on tv and saying how wonderful it so many Americans have caught it then called the vaccine a gift from god.</p>
<p>This is why I am glad they are doing it. Anyone who is too stupid to see this deserves what they get and America will be better off.</p>

        <p>I have taught for 10 years, and have encountered more self-righteousness, selfishness, and lack of perspective in one day of perusing this sub as I have during that entire time working with children. Well done! Really quite impressive. </p>
<p>And you know the kicker I discovered replying to some posts? This VERY sub has limits on how often I can comment. Meaning the mods have decided it makes sense to regulate users’ behavior for the good of the general group. Hmmmm.. but... whaddabout my liberty!!!</p>
<p>And before anyone thinks that the comparison of subreddit moderation to covid restrictions makes no sense, it’s a hell of a lot more apt than comparing travel restrictions to the LITERAL holocaust just a couple posts down. You guys are fucking embarrassing</p>

<p>Nice try, but nope. This is an automated reddit wide feature aimed to tackle spammers. I'm thinking you've likely commented here a couple of times and been downvoted heavily, tripping the algorithm to put a limit on your comments since you're flagged as a spammer. It's happened to me on many Liberal subreddits i've commented on with a differing opinion.</p>

        <p>So is it a good feature? Are you in favor of moderation? It doesn’t make a difference whether it’s automated or not. The point is that sometimes, rules to regulate behavior can be for the good of the general well being. A point people on here are completely unaware of apparently</p>

        <p>I didn't state any sort of personal opinion on the feature. I'm just the messenger. It does make a difference in this instance since you thought it was the mods intentionally regulating your activity on here. But that's not the case. </p>
<p>If you want my opinion though, I do think it is a stupid feature since it inhibits free speech and ends up punishing the wrong people. Sometimes a feature intended to be beneficial, ends up backfiring being detrimental. Or targeted at the wrong people/places. A point people like you are also unaware of.</p>

        <p><em>Businesses</em> should have the right to kick anyone out for any reason. The <em>government</em> should not mandate businesses to kick people out.</p>

<p>* Edit to add: I say for <em>any reason</em>, but I do think there are protected rights of people where businesses should not kick people out, and I do think businesses should still be required to issue appropriate refunds if they do kick people out under certain circumstances.</p>

        <p>Communism and capitalism is kind of a false dichotomy. Communism implies government controls business, while capitalism implies business controls government, but they're one in the same at the highest levels. Centralized authoritarianism is centralized authoritarianism.</p>

<p>You fucking idiots. Wearing a mask is no different then wearing a seatbelt. You are choosing to ignore the overwhelming evidence in support of health protocols for Covid 19 in favour of your emotions and desire to feel superior. Why the fuck do you think doctors and nurses have worn masks for centuries. I wouldn't care except your stupidity can and will lead to more people dying from this pandemic.</p>

        <p>Haha that is the biggest fucking generalization I’ve ever seen in my life and it’s so badly wrong</p>
<p>Do you even have a source or is this just come straight out of your ass?</p>
<p>Literally anyone can drive drunk. People who love their lives and just made a poor decision one night do it, people who care about their lives but don’t think it’s a big deal do it, many people drunk drive and it is dangerous and horrible.</p>
<p>It’s not just ‘depressed people’ who don’t care about their lives </p>
<p>Why would you ever say something so fucking wrong with absolulty no evidence, even if that scenario is sometimes true, to proclaim it is almost all cases of drunk driving?</p>
<p>Also, it doesn’t invalidate my point, because endangering lives because you don’t care about your own, IS STILL RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT AND IS STILL A HORRIBLE SELFISH THING TO DO</p>
<p>How is it that this actually needs to be explained to you???</p>

        <p>You actually read my entire argument and then rather than address you blatantly disingenuous claim that only depressed people drunk drive you say this?</p>
<p>You can be selfish and still harm yourself. Selfish doesn’t mean you ‘care about yourself’ it means you put yourself before others. </p>
<p>“(of a person, action, or motive) lacking consideration for others; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure”</p>
<p>Some may do it for pleasure, some may simply not give a shit one way or another which, fine may not be selfish but guess what? It still endangers others </p>
<p>It is remarkable to me that you are convinced by your own arguments which you adamantly refuse to back up with little more than pretty idiotic and disingenuous remarks </p>
<p>So no, selfish people can drunk drive, and you don’t have to be ‘depressed’ to drunk drive either</p>
<p>I’m glad you acknowledged reading what I’ve said though! Now I know you are actually ignoring everything wrong with what you are saying because you want to be right. You are arguing for no reason but to be right</p>
<p>So again, you’ve read what I have to say, and still shut your mind off to criticisms , just go play Minecraft :)</p>

        <p>I'm sure you have your comfy well paying job and no family abroad. I mean fuck seeing my partner and fuck having a good resume for my future. Old and in risk groups have no responsibility whatsoever, I see them enjoying being maskless all the time. Yet I can't do anything and have to sit around home all day because everything is closed. Your kind of people are the real virus. Anything you don't like is selfish, you lack the skills of understanding how others have different lives compared to you.
Everything that could have prevented this mess like idk banning Chinese when a mystery virus was spreading was racist. It wasn't deadly then but suddenly we have to throw away all of our liberties because of it. Any skepticism towards the vaccine and moving goalposts is just Trump fascist conspiracy theories!!!
Well look at you guys now. Mandating how we have to live and behave. Who are the fascists now under the disguise of pandemic which is just another flu.</p>

<p>But second, desire to feel superior? That's what you and everyone else are reveling in during this entire pandemic.

        <p>Yeah I saw this one already. It came out very recently. All it does is say face masks can stop incoming droplets. If you ask me, this is common sense and only marginally useful. I wouldn’t call it overwhelming. </p>
<p>This is a larger, more robust study. https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial</p>
<p>&rt;But no matter how the researchers sliced and diced their data, they could not find a strong signal that the volunteers in the mask group were more protected than their counterparts in the control group.</p>
<p>Of course they say people should wear them more and then it would really work!! But this is just speculation.</p>

        <p>The study seems to disagree, limited to what we currently know about transmission. </p>
<p>&rt;In conclusion, these experiments demonstrate that both surgical and simple handmade masks such as a single-layer cotton mask can suppress the risk of direct person-to-person virus transmission through large droplet deposition. The data do not allow us to draw conclusions on the risks of virus transmission through aerosol inhalation. Assuming that SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission through aerosol is small compared to through large droplets, these results suggest that physical distancing can be reduced with the use of face coverings.</p>

        <p>They “can”, yes. That’s not in dispute. But do they? Wording matters in these studies. They would have definitely stated “they do stop droplet transmission” or something along those lines if they could have.</p>
<p>That’s why I don’t believe this was that useful of a study. The Denmark study would have been a significant finding had it actually found something.</p>

        <p>You're thinking too much about too little.</p>
<p>Language is evolutionary by nature. As time goes on the concepts can be more complex that are conveyed through it. So you can look at those findings and think "well it reduces droplets and the virus transmits through droplets. Therefore, it should reduce risk".</p>
<p>Or, you can go backwards and analyze the use of the word can. And arrive at whatever conclusion you have arrived at.</p>
<p>You see what I am saying? You should check in on the condition that your condition is in.</p>

        <p>Hey we're agreed if we're using the word "can" and "should". But these words matter in scientific papers. There's a big difference in a paper between "can" and "does". It's not a trivial choice in these studies.</p>
<p>I don't doubt cloth can stop droplets. And, yes, it should prevent some transmission. But does it? That's the question. The most robust study done thus far claims found no evidence for that claim. This indicates that even though the mask "should" help, it doesn't in real world applications.</p>
<p>I wear my mask like a good citizen. Because better safe than sorry... and because it makes people feel better and frankly it's not that big a deal to me. But I'm not convinced it's actually doing anything. The evidence is mixed at best.</p>

        <p>They “can”, yes. That’s not in dispute. But do they? Wording matters in these studies. They would have definitely stated “they do stop droplet transmission” if they could have. </p>
<p>That’s why I don’t believe this was that useful of a study. The Denmark study would have been a significant finding had it actually found something.</p>

<p>Please point to where I am calling bullshit.</p>
<p>Why don't you follow the science? The available evidence is not convincing. In fact, the largest study and most robust study found mask wearing had no effect on transmission. There are plenty of countries who have done face masks mandates and are doing horribly too. This is fact. The evidence is mixed at best.</p>
<p>As for vaccines, are you saying people who "call bullshit" shouldn't take the vaccine? That's not a science-based approach. Everybody should get it. You really should follow the science.</p>
