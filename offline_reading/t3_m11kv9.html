    <strong>Could someone explain to me why people in India are wearing masks?</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.webcamtaxi.com/en/india/uttarakhand/shantikunj-gayatri-pariwar-haridwar.html</p>
<p>This is it guys. This is the new normal. People in India are wearing masks. I can’t fathom how this could be real. I’ve tried for a year now but if people in India are wearing masks than it has to be real. Once again. I can’t fathom how. The numbers are not impressive even if they didn’t include duel mortality. </p>
<p>People in India are wearing mask. There is no escape. If you can’t escape the bullshit in India than we are all fucked. We mind as well throw in the towel.</p>
<p>I feel like Dale in that episode of king of the hill. The government is telling the truth. I’m gonna go get vaccinated and start reporting my neighbors. Stay safe, we all in this together including India. /s?</p>
<p>I just need to give up on anything getting better. Who am I in the new normal? I’m definitely not the same person I was. I couldn’t be, no matter how hard I tried. I’m just nothing. There is no place for me here.</p></p>

        <p>Not everyone in India, mostly just in the cities where the propaganda works. Where I am almost no one is wearing masks, and “corona” has been over since last May basically.</p>

<p>I don’t know man. Even if it’s not real. You got mothers in India playing this garbage. I don’t know what anyone can do. </p>
<p>I guess it you could join a group of wild wolves in  nature, than you could free yourself from this noise but other wise... They got mother fucking India. Fuck me!</p>

        <p>Half the people I saw in this video didn't wear a mask.</p>
<p>If you look at the recent farmer protests, with thousands squeezed together, few of them are wearing masks. Yet since these mass gatherings have started, Covid numbers in India actually went down.</p>

        <p>I don’t want to wear a mask or “social distance” either. I think it’s bullshit. But I’d like to seriously ask what you guys would suggest would stop this disease from getting to the vulnerable population. If you think masks and social distancing are extreme what is the reasonable approach. I think people who are “at risk” should just get paid to stay home. Why is our government treating this so irresponsibly?</p>

        <p>I suggest that people who are sick go to the doctor and let the doctor tell them what to do in their individual case.</p>
<p>When it comes to the government, I don't want them to do anything.</p>
<p>I'm a grown-up and want to make my own-decisions, I don't want the government to act as helicopter-parents for me.</p>

        <p>I don’t know man. But if people in India are wearing masks than that must be absolutely fucking necessary. No seat belts and everyone rides in the roof in India. And these motherfuckers are wearing masks. </p>
<p>I thought India was raw. But either Corona is more real than forty bodies and on the highway, 1,000 starving children and leprosy OR India is full of a bunch of bitches and I’ve been miss-informed about what goes on in India.</p>

        <p>Corona is deadly to the old people (and sick).  I assume India has a fuxkton of old people. I’m not Indian but their population density most likely warrants restrictions.</p>

        <p>India does not have a shit ton of old people just because their population density is high. It’s median age as of 2020 is 28.4 years. Compare that to Italy with a median age of 47.5 years. What does that tell you? 
India is a developing country, as with other developing countries they don’t have access to the healthiest lifestyle nor is it embedded in the culture. I implore you to do more research</p>

        <p>Everyone everywhere follows government commands. If the government didn’t say masks they wouldn’t do it. It really is that simple. Compliance is lower in India but still most comply. Bandwagon thing as well, developing countries copy the west.</p>
