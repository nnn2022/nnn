        <p>You people are all the same with your follow the professionals rhetoric. I find it funny that you guys are naive enough to think that every medical professional agrees with the mouthpieces you see on tv...</p>
<p>So you know it's not just Facebook moms against masks, Many extremely educated people in the medical field realize their use and effectiveness is being overblown.</p>
<p>Recently I went to an ear nose and throat specialist and once we got in his office he told me you don't gotta wear your mask and he took off his. This man has a Ph.D. and is more versed in anything medical related than both of us will be in our lifetime do you judge him the same way you judge us?</p>
<p>here is another example of a "trained professional" voicing dissent towards the way covid is being handled politically</p>
<p>I have emailed Doctors like Kenneth Remy(Who made that what dying of covid looks like video)</p>
<p>And Even though my initial contact with him was not the most polite, He was 10x better than any mask or lockdown person on this site.</p>
<p>HE made a point to tell me that he has not advocated for any type of mandates or restrictions and shares just as much skepticism about the vaccine as most people here...</p>
<p>Although I think his video was overplayed it's the media that used it to twist the narrative to their agenda...</p>
<p>So yea I have literally emailed these peoples "trained professionals" and most of the time they don't actually think what you hear the news imply..</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/noinu_dica_one/comments/jxvvd0/do_the_we_believe_in_science_people_will_listen/">https://www.reddit.com/user/noinu_dica_one/comments/jxvvd0/do_the_we_believe_in_science_people_will_listen/</a></p>
<p>Even the person who invented the PCR tets Kary Mulis who is dead now has said that depending on how these tests are configured they can show an immense amount of false positives(same with the health Canada rep above Teresa tam that resigned in march))</p>
<p>You can also find Videos of Kary before his death absolutely laying into Dr. Fauci and all the other media mouthpieces that you people love to listen to...</p>
<p>Furthermore  Are you aware of the immense amount of false positives in the PCR tests that are being used to fearmonger us into compliance on the daily news? Even the deaths which they rarely mention are being counted as covid deaths when it's not directly from covid the person merely had the virus at the time of death or an active case for a PCR test could simply be the antibodies being found in someone's body...</p>
<p>Do you know that in Sweden the majority of people don't wear masks and there were no lockdowns and they do just as good maybe even better than us,</p>
<p>IDK about the US but did you know that under the charter of rights section 7 every Canadian citizen is granted security of person this entails that they and only they get to choose what happens and what is placed upon their body this would include a mask...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Regarding masks, It's not about convenience or not being impacted the problem with the mask bylaws is the fact that restaurants and businesses can be fined crazy amounts of money for letting people in without a mask IE a pizza shop who lets a 12-year-old in without one or any other example,</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Where I live masks are mandatory but people take em off to eat in restaurants and the government portrays crazy 10k fines for the businesses that let people in!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The problem is people like you get all caught up in the politics of does it work does it stop the spread it's not about having a medical degree do some research and you will realize most masks people are wearing do nothing</p>
<p>Its insane people like you just defend these tyrannical bylaws you truly believe the ends justify the means of ticketed people and that is not the case shame on any of you who believe its right to ticket people because of mask bylaws</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You people probably think it's just to ticket people for breaking gathering guidelines(In Ontario they don't even need a warrant anymore to search your house for it) as well where I live that 10 inside 25 out province-wide so even in a rural area with a barn and lots of space 10k fine for over 25 or 10 inside its fucking tyranny the government has you guys focusing on the effectiveness I don't give a shit even if everyone has n95 masks its unjust to ticket people for not wearing one!</p>
<p>The government is turning into the thought police and all you sons of bitches support it with your ego because you're still asleep!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

        <p>The 'professionals' took medical exemptions into account. They're not perfect but there's that at least.</p>
<p>I got covid, from a nurse, so probably have immunity anyway. Milder than a cold - I don't want to be protected from it, especially if it means people around wear masks. I find how clinical it is distressing, hospital trauma, and that it impedes communication and human connection. Doesn't it seem wrong to you to talk about people as a 'threat to society'? We didn't do this during flu season. Would you have been a 'threat' then? How should I, as a vegan, feel about meat-eaters given the pandemic risk of eating animals and animal agriculture, as well as the risk it poses to antibiotic efficacy? What about cultures -which is not exclusively or mainly China so don't single them out- where wild animals are eaten? Related to that, could certain ideologies -to a vegan, eating animals is one, veganism is a philosophy/ideology not just a diet- be a 'threat', and how would you judge which?</p>

        <p>Next it's going to be just take the vaccine, just subscribe to the digital identity, just allow the government to control your life because Rona is so bad if you don't you're a bad person!  People like you are the foot soldiers of what's to come, unthinking sheep morons doing whatever they're told and getting angry at people who don't.  </p>
<p>Can you explain how in the fuck someone described as "one of the world's leading experts on infectious diseases" can go from saying masks aren't necessary to saying wearing them will save 1000s of lives?  How he can go from saying asymptomatic spread is never the driver of diseases to now basically encouraging everyone to look at everyone as if they're plague rat even if they're perfectly healthy.</p>

<p>Lol, you need to get out of the mentality that you are wearing a mask to help people.</p>
<p>I don't know where you heard this but it is not true, just the whole idea that you are okay with people helping you for your own good and limiting things for your own good means you are ignorant and don't really what's going on I will leave you with a quote because nothing I say will change your opinions maybe the words of Ck lewis will</p>
<p>&rt;“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”</p>
<p>- C.S. Lewis</p>

<p>You see at the end of the day you guys always argue with emotion by saying we are protecting you you should be protecting people etc.</p>
<p>You don't have an ounce of logic in your mentality and your also lacking the objectivity to see the big picture and understand that masks are about compliance first and public health second...</p>
