        <p>Literally: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caning_of_Charles_Sumner</p>
<p>"The Beating of Charles Sumner, or the Brooks–Sumner Affair, occurred on May 22, 1856, in the United States Senate chamber, when Representative Preston Brooks, a pro-slavery Democrat from South Carolina, used a walking cane to attack Senator Charles Sumner, an abolitionist Republican from Massachusetts. The attack was in retaliation for a speech given by Sumner two days earlier in which he fiercely criticized slaveholders, including a relative of Brooks, Andrew Butler. The beating nearly killed Sumner and contributed significantly to the country's polarization over the issue of slavery. It has been considered symbolic of the "breakdown of reasoned discourse"[1] and the use of violence that eventually led to the Civil War."</p>

        <p>A significant part of it was also economical. The north relied heavily on the Mississippi river which the south controlled. The south was also aided by the British Empire which was in direct conflict with the north. The emancipation proclemation for example only freed the slaves in the south and did nothing about the slaves in the north (Maryland, Delaware, etc). It just freed the slaves in the south so they could rebel against their holders. It was a basic war-tactic. "We no longer recognize the south's oppression over you. If you want to rebel, it's you against the south, the north will not interfere", basically, leaving the south to its own vices.</p>
<p>The slavery in the north remained.</p>

        <p>Teach yourself.  Read the primary sources from the 1860s.  There are a ton of official documents.  Each state that seceded wrote an official document explaining why they seceded.<br>
The language is a bit hard to understand because it was written in the 1860s but they made it clear that they seceded to preserve the dominance of the white man over the subservient and inferior black man.  It is all there.<br>
That is why historians know it was mostly over slavery, each state wrote specifically that it was to preserve the institution of slavery and white supremacy in general.</p>

        <p>It wasn't just about slavery. A huge part of the Civil War was state rights. </p>
<p>Basically, the states originally signed onto the Constitution thinking of themselves as independent and free states joining together of their own free will, and able to leave at any time. When the Federal government started getting more powerful and trying to force the states to do what it wanted, such as on the issue of slavery, the Southern states wanted to secede from the nation, and that started the Civil War.</p>

        <p>It was about states’ rights.  And the main right they were concerned about was owning slaves.  The whole thing revolves around the issue of slavery.  A big point of contention was the south wanted the north to return fugitive slaves which they weren’t.</p>

        <p>&rt;A significant part of it was also economical.</p>
<p>No doubt a significant portion was economic, but most of that was centered around the economic consequences of the elimination of slavery.</p>
<p>&rt;The north relied heavily on the Mississippi river which the south controlled.</p>
<p>True, but not relevant until the beginning of the war (and then only until the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863).</p>
<p>&rt;The south was also aided by the British Empire which was in direct conflict with the north.</p>
<p>The British Empire maintained a fairly neutral posture.  They certainly engaged in some trade with the South, made some ships (including the CSS Florida), etc., but the British can hardly be said to have been in direct conflict with the North.  The North certainly wouldn't have been able to maintain the blockade of the South if the British had decided to declare it illegal and sail the Royal Navy out from Kingston or Bermuda.</p>
<p>&rt;The emancipation proclemation for example only freed the slaves in the south and did nothing about the slaves in the north (Maryland, Delaware, etc).</p>
<p>It was even less than that.  The Emancipation Proclamation only freed slaves from areas under rebellion that were not currently occupied by the North.  Not only did it not free slaves in the 4 border states, but the North controlled large portions of Tennessee and Louisiana at the time (including New Orleans - by far the largest confederate city pre-war, as well as Nashville and Memphis).</p>
<p>&rt;It just freed the slaves in the south so they could rebel against their holders.</p>
<p>It was less so they could rebel than that the Union army could free slaves as they moved through territory.  There were many times during the war where the Union Army moved through an area but didn't occupy it - Grant's move towards Jackson during the Vicksburg campaign, Sherman's march to the sea, etc. and the EP allowed the army to free the slaves in any plantations they passed.</p>

        <p>State by state… some did it immediately.  NY and NJ implemented gradual emancipation schemes that ended by 1830s.  But none of the northern states had the economic dependence on chattel slavery that the southern states mostly did.</p>

        <p>Both Boston and New York have their own natural deep water harbors, with the Saint Lawrence River and Hudson River being the main rivers used for trade and transport. It wasn't until the full development of the Ohio River Valley that the Mississippi became important. It's also important to remember that France still owned most of the land west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>Also, just a minor point, slavery had been abolished by every northern state prior to the outbreak of the Civil War. You can't free slaves that don't exist. The only ones left were in the states controlled by the rebels. I would point out that the CSA never received international recognition, by any country, and only existed in the minds of traitors. The minute they signed their succession letters they weren't a new nation, they were criminals.</p>
<p>I'd like to hear the list of other 'States Rights' beyond the right to own another human being.</p>

        <p>You’re very, very wrong.</p>
<p>First off: The Louisiana Purchase transferred <strong>all</strong> French land <strong>west</strong> of the Mississippi to the United States in 1803. I don’t know where you get the idea that France still “owned most of the land west of the Mississippi.”</p>
<p>Second: Missouri, Kentucky, Delaware, West Virginia, and Maryland, all <strong>slave states,</strong> remained in the union throughout the war. Slaves there were not freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. In fact, Slavery in Maryland was still legal in 1864. Furthermore, most slave states declined to secede until Union troops attempted to invade their territory and attack the coastal states that initially formed the Confederacy.</p>
<p>Third: The U.S. Treasury was funded almost entirely by duties and tariffs on imported goods, of which the Lions share was supplied by southern ports, where international commerce was conducted by an equal exchange of goods rather than hard currency as in the north. By seceding, the southern coastal states removed that form of revenue from the union treasury. Their lower tariffs also guaranteed that foreign exporters would sooner trade goods with southern ports rather than northern ones, leading to smuggling across the long border. The north was also justifiably concerned that travel along the Mississippi would be subject to hefty tolls.</p>
<p>Fourth: The idea that secession from a voluntary union of sovereign states, was an criminal act, rather than states rights, would be the subject of vigorous debate at they time. The very United States was formed by secession, a fact that was pointed out with hilarity by British critics of the war — including Charles Dickens — who saw the conflict as a financial dispute over revenue. In 1832, South Carolina threatened to secede, again, over tariffs. President  Buchanan took no actions against the seven states which seceded during his term. The notion of the federal government as an inviolable authority with an Imperial Executive branch did not arise until the inauguration of Lincoln.</p>
<p>Fifth: Lincoln was more a dictator than a president. He arrested at least 1000 critics of the war and held them without charge., suspending Habeas Corpus — something only Congress could legally do. He arrested the Maryland state legislature, and sent the army to shut down newspapers that printed opinion pieces challenging his authority. These acts were even more treacherous, unconstitutional and criminal than the South peacefully separating from a country that exploited them with unequal reward. I shudder to think what he would have done to the nation during his second term.</p>
<p>I recommend you abandon your idea of an abolitionist war fought by a noble President Lincoln. It is false.</p>

        <p>The south was as willing to use federal power as the north was, they just felt their position slipping as they polarized around the issue of slavery. If the north hadn't been more powerful and the abolitionist movement hadn't gained traction they might have been the seperatists. The existence of a half-free and half-slave country was untenable, as each state's stance had consequences outside its borders (free state majority, Fugitive Slave act, abolishing international slave trade, "slave power" where slaves gave the south more voting power in congress for some reason, etc.) and each side doubled down as the issue continued to garner violence.</p>
<p>Then South Carolina took a half-finished fort back by force that they had already conceded to the US government. Why? Because it was clear that both sides were gearing up for war, and the dam was going to break.</p>
<p>Imo summing it up as "state's rights" makes less sense than "slavery" even though the real answers is "differences and polarization creating warmongering and violence... centered around the issue of slavery."</p>

        <p>I've been joking since the start of the 'two weeks' that this whole pandemic BS is going to last until 2025. I was hoping it'd stay a joke, but of course clown world tries to prove me wrong again.</p>

        <p>I mean we could go back and forth all day but just imagine if you were half as good at getting exercise as you are talking yourself out of it and making excuses? You can do it bro. Start with jogging. It’s going to suck. You’re going to hate it. But eventually you won’t, and how good being in athletic shape feels will open up all sorts of possibilities for you mentally.</p>

        <p>No I'm not talking myself out of it, just not sure if I'll be great at the apocalypse if it depends on pure physical ability, that doesn't mean I'm not gonna try, I've thought about this a lot but I think I'm gonna try to hide somewhere and come out when it's over if I can and that's the best thing for most people to try to do rn anyways, find a rural place where you can prepare for it, have a lot of backup plans, but Idk what's gonna happen if guns get taken away. So yeah preparing in mutliple ways is the best strategy but no matter what it's scary knowing the kind of weapons that the government has that no one else does.</p>

<p>Probably not even that if they're really going to attempt to come to people's homes to try to convince people to get the vaccine. Not saying you should shoot those people, just saying if they're that confident in their utopian thinking they won't be a very hard target to hit when society breaks down</p>

        <p>The best kind for resale, liquidity, and a store of value is what's called "investment grade bullion" and those come in the form of coins or bars. These are 99.9% pure so they are significantly better than jewelry. I'd recommend jewelry ONLY if you have absolutely no other choice. Most places have access to bullion.</p>

        <p>I'd recommend you have a wide variety of both. The larger bars are better for buying other assets later while the individual ounce coins are great for bartering or buying groceries, etc. Try to visit your local coin shop and see which coins and bars are best for you. 😊</p>

        <p>Christs return will be the dawn. The Son of God will bring the light with him. That's the only time the beast system gets destroyed. Even then, there will still be a fight as they worship the fake devil, they won't bow to Jesus. But Jesus will overcome them. And will start the thousand year reign before Jesus "hands the keys over" to his Father, God. And God will dwell with man once those who are in the Book of Life are made immortal. </p>

        <p>Context also matters - none of them carried weapons, the only person who died was one of the 'insurrectionists' and they were let into the building with not even a whisper of resistance. Have you ever seen footage of an actual insurrection? Becayse if you had, you really can't call what happened in the US one. Oh, and before you start, I'm not from the US and I'm not some kind of alt right Trump supporter, I'm just a guy who has eyes and a brain and knows when I'm being lied to.  The way people carry on about this incident you would think thousands of people armed with AR15s had started gunning down democrats or something. Now that would of been an insurrection!</p>

        <p>There was resistance in the areas where they wanted a good photo op for the false flag, and no resistance where they wanted a photo op of the 'insurrectionists' inside the building.  If you're asking me to believe they would have got anywhere near the actual inside of the building without them being let in, I'm never gonna buy it.  They weren't even armed with firearms.</p>

        <p>I love that in order for your thoughts to make any sense whatsoever there needs to be a conspiracy attached to it.</p>
<p>I also love that that conspiracy somehow aims at the democrats despite Republicans having majority control over higher government including the presidency.</p>
<p>I love that somehow this was simultaneously an antifa attack on the Capitol, just visitors checking out the scenery, a false flag attack, while almost everyone arrested has long term ties to the right wing but somehow doesn't warrant an investigation.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/17/politics/capitol-riot-guns-armed-insurrection/index.html">at least one person had a gun.</a> they were also armed with bear spray and bats/ other blunt weapons along with zip tie handcuffs which should be noted are specifically made a certain way to be handcuffs and are by no means normal zipties available at home depot.</p>
<p>The only reason it wasn't a successful insurrection is because it was a band of idiots led by an even bigger idiots.</p>

        <p>Oh NO, one person with a gun and a bunch of people armed with sticks, how will the world's largest, most advanced and well funded military deal with this!  Reminds me of the Simpsons 'what if they come back with a bigger piece of wood with a bigger nail in it!'  Show me some footage of the crowd firing shots at the police, in this supposed insurrection.  Go on, show me.  I'd love to see it.  How can you possibly claim an insurrection in one of the world's most armed countries, by the section of the populace most likely to not just carry guns, but to own multiple firearms including assault weapons, and then only find one fucking person carrying one and no shots fired by the crowd?  It's ludicrous.</p>
<p>It also has nothing to do with democrats or republicans, sorry to give you that impression.  Two sides of the same coin.  These idiots were lead by Trump, controlled opposition, who goaded them into a false flag photo op.  All parties are bought and controlled, and both sides lead to the exact same destination just down a different road.  Both sides are full of brainwashed idiots, just for different reasons.</p>

        <p>The big difference politically is that the typical BLM/Antifa crowd doesn’t outwardly endorse Biden or any of the establishment Democrats.  You won’t see a single Biden flag or anything close to what you’ll see with the far right and Trump.  That is how Biden won.  He is smart enough to distance himself from the crazies on the left while Trump fully embraces the crazies on the right just letting himself be pegged as the extremist candidate.  It just showed how little Trump knew about playing politics on a national scale.<br>
You’ll see a photo of the most fervent Trump supporters beating police with Trump flags while  nothing from the BLM riots to show they were Biden’s people.  Even individual interviews of BLM/Antifa people will have them say f’ Biden.  </p>
<p>I do think the far left has a better understanding that Trump and Biden are two sides of the same coin and that neither party could actually take them where they want to go.  The far right just seems much more hopelessly conventional and delusional.  That is the big difference I see.</p>

        <p>No further proof is needed to prove that BLM  is a domestic terrorist organization. BLM killed multiple people(including multiple children), caused millions of dollars in property damage, ruined honest business owners lives(a lot of black business owners, might I add), and they're a self-professed Marxist organization.</p>

        <p>BLM ✊🏿 is a righteous cause.  Those weren’t riots, it was just a block party that got out of hand after Biden stirred up the crowd.  When they broke the windows at Target with their Biden flags, it was actually the proud bois in disguise. The greeters at target welcomed them in and freely gave away their wares.  <br>
They did nothing wrong. No one was arrested or needed to be.  I personally donated a portion of my salary to push this righteous cause.</p>

        <p>Describing a person who flaunts the rules as petulant, and it's pretty clear most of you goons have a hard time with basic grammar structures. I mean good for you for proving the skeptics wrong. You've climbed out of the cesspool and found enlightenment. Then jumped back into it because the real world has consequences for your shitty rhetoric. The world isn't scared of you jambronies. They pity you</p>

        <p>I saw comments with 2-3k upvotes being hidden so I’m not surprised. And it’s mostly on the posts about this kind of things with the comments that go mildly against the agenda. Or even highly upvoted comments not being on the top but under controversial. Bonkers.</p>

        <p>Things have been going the same for two years. The news programs do nothing but terrify people, they all seem crazy. They have completely forgotten what the world was like before this "" pandemic "". Now they are testing the water and our prime minister Mario Draghi (former goldman sachs imposed by our president of the republic without going through the democratic vote) is pushing on the Green Pass: a QR code that identifies whether you are vaccinated or not. In a nutshell they are inciting the vaccinated against the unvaccinated. Those who do not inject the praised serum blessed savior of humanity will be cut off from social life, from public places and even, it was rumored, even from voting. Since 2018, the two largest parties that have been voted Lega and M5S, both anti-European parties, are governing together with the former president of the ECB. There is no party, to date, that would drag Italy out of the European financial concentration camp. Both Lega and M5S turned out to be a real social experiment to manage the dissent of the population due to the continuous deterioration of the country's welfare imposed by the cynical bureaucrats who sit in Brussels (ruthless cuts to public health, pension cuts, lengthening of the retirement age) There is no virus in the world in the name of which liberty, rights and the constitution can be put on leave, reintroducing new descriptions by law. Medicine and science are only the paint that covers and legitimizes an epochal restructuring of society, politics and the economy. A violent and infamous authoritarian and repressive order is underway. It is the new bio-capitalism of surveillance.</p>

        <p>I've come to realise that the press vilifies the good leaders and pedastalises the bad. The difference in reporting on Biden's clearly rapidly declining mental state vs the bitter and malicious reporting on Trump throughout his term has made it crystal clear to me that the news media are not trustworthy.</p>

        <p>Australia. The whole country is a shit show. The Prime minister has zero leadership and is just letting state premiers run rampant with their authoritarian bullshit. NSW have just deployed the military to enforce COVID "mandates" (not laws) as well so martial law may very well be here to stay now.</p>

        <p>Sad but true. Unfortunately most people in Australia still believe that all of the problems within our borders stem from ineptitude and idiocy of our leaders. Seemingly completely unwilling to wrestle with the idea that our leaders are very possibly pure evil, selfish career politicians (or leeches as I like to call them) sucking the life out of every single one of their countrymen for their own benefit, willing and ready to sell us out to the highest bidder at any and every opportunity. If our country collapses it will not be because of some virus or a "China takeover" (not a hostile one at least), it will be because we put our faith in evil and selfish people.</p>

        <p>Yes they are ahead but sadly we must wait almost two years for the next elections, even though it is clear to everyone that the political view of the country radically shifted since 2018. We'll never have elections before 2023 because they don't want the right to win. Anyway Salvini (leader of Lega) talks a lot but in practical he didn't do anything to oppose restrictions. Never voted against. The only one is FdI but I feel like if they were in the government they would do the same. Anyway I'd take a lega-fdi government over PD-M5S every day, even if they're not the best either.</p>
<p>We have one of the worst work situations of the first world and EU, and young people on the labour day (1st of may) could only protest to approve an LGBT law instead of protesting for actual work improvement, avoiding that so many people (including me) must leave the country to have a fair salary for what they do. It's tragic and comic to see everyone fighting for "DDL Zan" (the LGBT stuff) while their country is going to crumbles. I hope that there'll be a good decade of right government that maybe can do something about all this mess, don't have much hope though, I'll give my support from abroad</p>

<p>I'm afraid things are different this time. We haven't had a properly elected government in <em>decades</em> by the way.</p>
<p>&rt; Besides, aren't Lega and FdI way in the lead in polling?</p>
<p>Lega at this point is 100% controlled opposition. FdI might be, might not be. Who knows. As far as things are, except far right parties like Forza Nuova, nobody is saying <em>this is all madness, let's stop this once and for all</em>. Everybody has its own different kind of restrictions they'd like to enforce.</p>

        <p>You know there is a new exrtrmism rising in europe, italy is in it, france, germany will follow very soon. </p>
<p>Im in switzerland, we are still unsure if we want to follow this extremism or if we once again stay neutral. Our government want this of course, and 2yr can get vacinated without consent of their parrents. But when it comes to the covid certificate (our version - compatible to the green pass) there is political opposition (but only from grasroot movements, not from bigger politicans).</p>
<p>How many people do opose the passport and especially the vaccine in italy? Is there anything planed? Strikes or something?</p>

<p>He was walked in and assumed his position, by a "coalition" that is composed of forces that were insulting each other on TV the day before and now magically agree that the usurer from the BCE is the best thing since sliced bread. That coalition is like 90% of the parliament. </p>
<p>A parliament that by the way hasn't been determined by free election since I don't even remember when... whenever people vote, straight after the vote the "elected" change the cards and shuffle themselves in a way that goes directly against what the voter have voted for. Anti establishment parties that ally with the biggest establishment party like it's nothing.</p>

<p>Green passes make no sense because the vaccine is non sterlizing. You're not protecting anyone but yourself by getting this vaccine. So why would the state need 20 years old to inject themselves with shit when the at risk are protected and the injection wouldn't protect anyone but the injected anyway?</p>

        <p>The Spanish flu killed 50 million without our modern medicine, corona has killed 10% of that already with modern medicine and containment efforts.</p>
<p>Historically the Spanish flu was actually ignored by most countries, with Spain being the first to acknowledge it despite its origin elsewhere.</p>
<p>Refusing to lock down, wear masks, or vaccinate is going to have the same effect as the WWI censors on Spanish Flu - it’ll be worse.</p>
<p>The best chance we have of getting this shit over and done with is vaccinating, and if you can’t just stay away from other people</p>

        <p>I support socialised Medicare, universal basic or a variation thereof (to provide at least food, shelter, and water), and foreign aid. I’ve always wanted to reduce suffering as much as possible.</p>
<p>But you are somewhat right, covid (and formerly Ebola) are considered bigger issues primarily because they affect western countries. It’s nationalistic and pretty shitty actually. Whether it makes people hypocrites or not is debatable, but the fault lies a lot more on the media than the people.</p>

<p>Yes, but in practice no. Most of the population is unarmed, the ones who do have a gun would be massively outgunned by the meekest police patrol that they might send out.</p>

        <p>Yes we can. You need a permit and to do a test. Similar to getting a driving licence. About 1.5 million Italians have this gun permit. Obviously there are also lots of illegal weapons (just think of the mafia)</p>

        <p>I think its the end of the EU as we know it.</p>
<p>If you have a base of 20/25% of the various national populations opposed to vaccine passports and actively discriminated against - they will protest but also seek democratic representation.</p>
<p>"fringe" political parties will pivot to absorb this voter base. It might take 5 / 10 years - several election cycles to work its way through the system, but the result is a paralysed European parliament, a commission with no democratic mandate and I think we will see a constant push for idependence referendums. </p>

        <p>I was a teen when the EU started becoming "something" and I was all for it. Easy border crossing, the ability to be able to go work in Spain without too much of a hassle, the fact that you could go to Italy and buy a car cheaper than in France...</p>
<p>Then the Euro came into play, and I saw the issues starting to crop up.</p>
<p>Everything got more expensive almost overnight, and you could see the  "U.S.E. (United States of Europe)" rear its ugly head. But unlike the USA, the USE was going to be a pure government for the governments, and the citizen could just take it.</p>

        <p>In my humble, non-European opinion, the major problem was how taxes in one country within the EU were used all over, rather than for that country. It's almost the opposite here in These United States. There's State tax and Federal Tax. FedTax gets spread all over, but State Tax is ment for the state that acquired it.</p>
<p>Of course, this also leads to the issue that many non-Americans have when coming here. They expect the price on the tag to include the tax, but since each state sets its own tax. A skateboard may be valued at $30 all across the nation, but you may pay $35 in New Jersey and $33 in Texas.</p>

        <p>The explanation is there. If you meant evidence, then just look at literally any government or regime to ever exist.. </p>
<p>The economies in almost every major country is in flux, and the governments are willing to take whatever measures necessary to come out/remain on the top. </p>
<p>These measures will not stop covid.</p>

        <p>Hello vaccine passport-supporting Nazi,</p>
<p>The Nazis had the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A "show me your papers" system to limit movement of people, especially dissidents. Like what the vaccine passports are.</li>
<li>Forced medical experimentation, like these "vaccines" are.</li>
<li>Demonization of the people they didn't like, like you see the media pushing now.</li>
</ul>
<p>No, maybe the Nazis didn't have vaccine passports. But history doesn't repeat, it rhymes. And the vaccine passport system certainly rhymes with the actions of the Nazis.</p>

<p>Nerdy Lord of the Rings analogy - The Green Pass is like "The ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL"</p>

        <p>I don't know the entire details of what I see there but it looks like people grouped together in Parliament making a show of protest against the Green Pass.</p>
<p>That's what we need. I'll be at City Hall with the Reopen San Diego group tomorrow, and at the Board of Supervisors meeting on August 17th with our people. Showing support, spreading the word. Trying to get neighbors.</p>
<p>What are YOU doing besides criticizing others who are actually getting out from behind their keyboards to try to do something?</p>
<p>Don't armchair quarterback. Get in the game. Take action.</p>

        <p>sure, in italy it's called either 'certificazione verde' or just 'green pass'. usually the term 'green pass' is used preferentially because.. simpler i guess, less syllables</p>

        <p>Before you start thinking these p*liticians are good or freedom fighters: they only oppose the green pass for economic reasons. It's never about personal freedom, it's always "muh green pass will penalize local businesses and tourism". </p>
<p>Anyone near power participates in power. Do not be illuded. They are not your friends. They will never be. They just want power.</p>

        <p>If you want the vaccine get it; if you don't, don't. People should be allowed to live together regardless. I don't mind being around vaccinated people at all, and if they are confident in their decision to get it, then they should not mind being around me. What is the point of your vaccine if it does not protect you from the virus?</p>
<p>We have two clear mindsets here. One saying to live together, the other saying we are unclean and cannot be part of their society as if we do not all possess the same rights anymore. If you don't see a problem with this I feel sorry for you.</p>

        <p>No. If you can, you should absolutely get the vaccine. </p>
<p>There are many people that can't get vaccinated for health reasons. You choosing to not vaccinate puts them in danger.</p>
<p>&rt; What is the point of your vaccine if it does not protect you from the virus?</p>
<p>If the virus mutates in your body, I will no longer be protected. Kids, people with vaccine alergies, people with health problems unable to vaccinate, will not be protected.</p>
<p>&rt; the other saying we are unclean and cannot be part of their society</p>
<p>Same reasoning as to why you have to wash your hands when working in a kitchen. It is unclean and spreading sickness. You cannot whine about not being able to cook for other people while being unclean. And you shouldn't spread Covid just because you feel like it. </p>
<p>Because anti-vaxxers endanger other people, my job before covid hit was to control if kids at a school got the measle vaccine and alert authorities if they didn't. I don't see how with covid it should be any different.</p>

        <p>You did a nice job not calling it The War of Northern Agresession. From the first stroke of their pen, they declared themselves traitors to the same nation their father had fought to create, and they did so for the sole purpose of owning another human being. The smoke and mirrors about the southern economy and their contributions to the larger success of the nation are entirely disingenuous when you fail to mention the Northern factories that took their ill-gotten cheap goods and turned them into actual goods to trade.</p>
<p>The South had no economy outside of a few select cash crops, and their continued dependence on the federal government a century and a half later just proves the failure of the Conservative ideology.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans live in a failed state, and they all sound just like you: delusional, and afraid that they may have believed a bunch of liars their whole lives.</p>

        <p>There was a US document that was leaked right before the covid lockdown started (mid2020). It pretty much had a layout with the month and year of how things would go. It stated the lockdown, then said aprx a year after that lockdown would be lifted, then lockdown would return. It mentioned the vaccination passports and covid would be disappear 2024. It had other stuff in there about cashless society. I have looked for this document for the past few weeks  and can't find it. If I knew things where going to be going they way they have been I would have saved it when I saw it. Does anyone happen to know the document I'm talking about? I believe Nancy Pelosi was mentioned on it somewhere.</p>
