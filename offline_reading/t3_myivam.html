<title>The craziest thing I have learned but am still verifying completely is how a politician like Doug Ford may have rigged the system. We don't have enough transparency to really know. But the dude has a signage company and may have profited off the covid signs in some of the bids Net worth $50 million.</title>

        <p>Huge discussion in the UK right now and huge discussion around the cronyism exhibited by the tenders for Covid contracts. Has all come to a head now that the former PM David Cameron has been caught texting the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ask for public money. Former Downing Street advisor Dominic Cummings has come out of the woodwork to accuse Boris Johnson of outright corruption. Enquiry into the Cameron affair is inbound, it’d be a good time to start following the story if you’re interested in UK politics. </p>
<p>What worries me is how people just seem to accept this with the current government as it lurches from scandal to scandal. A roll of the eyes, a wry smile, typical Tories, typical Boris, what are they like eh?</p>
<p>The apathy that is manifesting itself among our population about the flagrant criminality of our government is staggering. I can’t recall any ministers losing their position over this since the pandemic began, when any other PM, Home Secretary or Health Secretary would have found themselves out of a job by now. I’m actually more concerned that Boris is a Paul von Hindenburg, paving the way for a future Hitler, as there is so much self serving corruption on display with such far-reaching tentacles in Westminster that it might well take a strongman populist to undermine it in any meaningful sense. </p>
<p>I hope that Canada doesn’t end up the same way, but the UK is a warning to you for what’s to come if your government isn’t held properly to account.</p>

        <p>This actually gave me chills. I appreciate you sharing this. It’s very difficult to discuss these things and it is quite frightening. The lies of a few control the many. I really hope the people can unite against their governments when corruption is taking place at the highest level. We have been fed so much that anything that is given we just consume regardless that it feels off. censorship has been all governments one of many weapons against the people they control.</p>

        <p>What I'm still trying to figure out is how Doug Ford got elected in the first place after being on that video with his crack smoking brother. I know we are pretty dense in candanavia but good lord can you say puppet.</p>
