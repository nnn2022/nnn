    <strong>Help me understand</strong>
    <p><p>I'm trying to understand the people who post/subscribe to this sub reddit. Isn't the whole "covid fake" thing kindov played out? The way I see it, everyone who rejects wearing a mask is selfish because they think they are smarter and more important than anyone else who is taking this pandemic seriously. Refusing to wear a mask or refusing to take Covid seriously in unpatriotic and shows how afraid of change people are. Not trying to start shit, just wanting to hear and understand views that differ from my own.</p></p>

        <p>If you want to wear a mask and get vaccinated, great. Go for it. Just don't force your choices on my body.</p>
<p>I don't believe sars-cov-2 is fake. I'm not an anti-vaxxer. All of the following beliefs come from peer-reviewed and published research from scientists: I believe that the death numbers have been inflated by (in the US) for-profit hospitals and megacap pharma firms seeking government payouts. I believe the case counts have been inflated by an unreliable PCR test. I believe that the effects of Covid have been exaggerated by the media and particularly the tech companies. Why? For the regular old motive: profit. To keep you watching and using their products.</p>

        <p>Not one country in particular. It doesn’t matter where you’re from, by putting your fellow citizens at risk (not wearing a mask) you are being unpatriotic to your country. You could be from anywhere and not wearing a mask is still demonstrating that you don’t trust or respect your government and or country.</p>

<p>And frankly, the citizens of my country keep voting for really bad people so...putting fellow citizens at risk would be a good thing if it were true. As it is, we cannot be blessed by a virus that will kill off any more than .15% of those infected. So we have to continue on with our fellow citizens being stupid for a while longer.</p>

        <p>You’re claiming that not wearing a mask is putting people at risk. Which also insinuates that wearing a mask is not putting people at risk. Both of these arguments are false.</p>

        <p>"Covid" is a kind of brand-name for a flu.   It's not fake, but the reaction to it is excessively overblown and being used to implement some rather draconian changes to society.</p>
<p>Some people cannot wear coverings over their mouth for medical or mental health reasons.   Even the CDC's best study shows that mask wearing is AT BEST 1.8% effective after 100 days. (And I question the validity of those numbers.)   It is not worth the damage to people or the environment.</p>
<p>By 'patriotic' I assume you refer to America.   America was founded on the principles of self determination and individual rights.   I am not responsible for your health.   It is not 'selfish' to want to make choices for myself about what is right for me.   </p>
<p>You don't really seem open to other views, since your post was rather dogmatic.   However, I will try to illuminate your mind and suggest you do some research into the topics around the covid mitigation tactics, and Agenda 2030 to better grasp what is being done to you and all of us.  The Corbett Report is a great starting point in that effort.   </p>
<p>Good luck to you.</p>
