    <strong>My perspective and feelings towards this new reality</strong>
    <p><p>An analogy:</p>
<p>Galileo said "Yo guys, actually the sun doesn't revolve around us, we revolve around the sun"</p>
<p>He then gets thrown in jail and everyone hates him. He even tried showing people, like <em>through</em> his telescope. Everyone thought it was some sort of magic or illusion that he put in place to fool them.</p>
<p>What is so wrong with discovering a change of pace in scientific theory? Well at the time, being the center of the universe was the basis of religion. It was scientific evidence that helped show how we are "special creations of God" and how we deserved special treatment, therefore you should follow religion. I know this is kinda controversial, but I personally believe religion was a form of control. And when the basis that underwrites an establishment's legitimacy to control is overturned, you see a backlash.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If Galileo were to say, oh look there is a star we have never seen before, then everyone would be like "cool I guess."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Both of these things are changes in science, except one of them alters people's worldview, and threatens a large establishment that controls people's thoughts and behaviors.</p>
<p>What we are seeing now is the same backlash in science. People who question the current narrative are being censored and ridiculed. It is social and corporate suicide to even ponder or question the current narrative. Why is it that scientific discoveries that involve irrelevant areas of society are more challenged, with the pursuit of truth as the clear objective? What we are doing now is attacking people ad hominem and seldom discussing the actual science. Why can we not raise questions? Why are we calling people conspiracy theorists? Give me a solid scientific argument against mine. THAT IS ALL WE WANT. But no, the simple act of questioning is enough for them to label you as crazy or a trump cultist, shut down the discussion and not give you any answers because it's "not worth their time to engage with someone so STUPID." Come on, either you know what you're doing, or your ego is showing how idiotic you are. The irony...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If their main goal is to have as many people vaccinated as possible, then give us a clear study and refute the opposing studies with class, rather than a single tweet that says "misinformation." Excuse me, please elaborate. This is science, not a petty argument.</p></p>

        <p>$cientism is the new oligarch owned religion. People worship agenda driven science with a dogmatic fervor and believe that scientists and the people that hire them are good and altruistic.</p>

        <p>Exactly. But people are so brainwashed to believe that people with positions of power are altruistic. In fact, seeking out a position of power in our capitalistic society is enough to prove their selfish nature. Money creates evil, and when science goes against the ability to make money there’s no chance it will be considered. This whole pandemic has shown, time and time again, that money is more important than human lives. It’s truly disgusting.</p>
