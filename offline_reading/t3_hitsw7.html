<title>Dont let them tell you that PSYOPs are conspiracy theories. The propaganda of covid is purely based on theories practiced in marketing, and marketing BY DEFINITION, is a psychological operation. Marketing has nothing to do with truth</title>

    <p><p>The problem here however is that laws were constructed from misinformation and propaganda, laws that are destroying livelihoods. Laws that set the precedent for any government to strip you if your right to work if too many people have symptoms of the common cold. It DOESN'T MATTER if it is covid or not, they can call it whatever they want and over report on ER visits to justify lockdown 2.0 with even more draconian measures, all because you let them get away with it already. This current lockdown was just a test run. </p>
<p>All they have to do is accuse skeptics of being alt right, conspiracy terrorists to get the retards to turn against any logic. (This is where we are) </p>
<p>This is one of the biggest frauds in history. We are in a dangerous situation when billionaires and scammers can get on TV and tell you that you are going to die unless you follow their orders. The criminal intent of this is overwhelming.</p>
<p>Even worse, they double checked how stupid the average American is by completely fabricating a civil rights movement, with fires, killings and destruction of monuments to justify site wide censorship actions right in the middle of MuH SoCiaL DiStAnCing.  </p>
<p>"Race" was just the gateway drug. Soon they will ban and block credit card payments to anyone who is smart enough to see through their scam, because your thinking has been deemed "problematic".</p>
<p>I never trusted the We Harvest Organs and the Criminal Disease Corporation, and now I have even more reason not to.</p></p>
