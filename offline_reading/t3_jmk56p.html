    <strong>Interesting study results and conclusions from 2015</strong>
    <p><p>I could be wrong but, I don't think many people are walking around in medical masks, or masks that are tailored to fit the person wearing it. My wife is has to go through the fitting process every so often. The hospital requires it and she is the only person that the mask will fit properly. I don't think many people are going through that process. </p>
<p>As you will see here, properly fitted, medical masks are somewhat effective. Cloth masks don't do shit and aren't recommended.</p>
<p>From the study....</p>
<p>"Conclusions</p>
<p>This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated."</p>

        <p>They look the same but are very different, surgeons wear tailored tight surgical masks that use a headstrap, the ones you can buy in shops are not surgical grade, do not use a headstrap, are not tailored, and might have little to no filtration.</p>

<p>Cloth masks are the stupidest thing ever</p>
