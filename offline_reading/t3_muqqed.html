    <strong>The narrative doesn’t match reality</strong>
    <p><p>I can’t believe the masses haven’t connected the dots yet.. I have worked four different jobs during the pandemic, three of them in retail. I know and have met so many people and yet I haven’t known or met anyone who has had covid personally. My mother has gotten one false positive test while all the follow up tests came back negative. Even all my friends back at university that live across the US, only like 1 or 2 “knows” someone or “knows someone who knows someone” who had covid. Compared to reality... the way the media talks about covid isn’t real at all...    Well, that’s just my simple and personal experience with covid. Hope you grandma killers have a fantastic maskless day ❤️~~~</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, a pandemic so deadly that here in the southwest we are "allowed" to take our mask off at our table inside the restaurant ... but cases haven't skyrocketed yet!?</p>

        <p>ah, the magical “covid only attacks you whilst standing up” Fact™️. or touch everything on the table/in the restaurant which is literally covered in all kinds of “pathogenic” bacteria then touch your mask and somehow neither you, nor anyone around you, falls ill, gets put on a ventilator, and dies.</p>
<p>hmmm. quite the pandemic we have on our hands.</p>

        <p>My over 90, already in very poor health grandma had it. Went to the hospital for unrelated reasons and found out.</p>
<p>Even though we aren't doomers we realistically recognized she was probably a goner just because about anything will be the end of her but she's still kicking at home again.</p>
<p>I know many more people that have had bad vaccine reactions than I do have knowingly had COVID.. and the only case of covid causing <em>serious</em>, illness was the above and her body was already fighting an infection and just general frailness but it overcame.</p>

        <p>My friend, the mask-wearing, WFM, online shopping, woke person got it. She was pretty much fine. She looked terrible in her IG pic, but was perfectly fine after all the social media support. Big surprise, she got vaxxed this month.  </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I had it back in November of 2019 before it was a thing. I'm also pretty sure my teenage son had it back in November of 2020, but he refused to get tested. And if it's so deadly wouldn't the rest of our family have gotten it then too? Or was it because we all had antibodies that lasted over a year!?</p>

        <p>Does anyone remember how the hype started? Back in January of ‘20, viral videos of Chinese citizens were flat out collapsing to the pavement due to “a deadly new coronavirus”.
People don’t have SHIT to say when I ask where the collapsing citizens are now</p>
