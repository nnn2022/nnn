        <p>I dont know where you are from but here in Germany some tests that work with saliva are approved. Then you just have to spit a little bit. Search the web if you have the possibility to make such a test instead of the nose rape ones.</p>

        <p>The sum total of the picture- with supposed extreme contagiousness of the virus- yet the nature of the deep nasal screening that's supposedly necessary for an accurate test has me thinking that the discomfort level is a desired objective and not a necessary evil.</p>
<p>Something that supposedly projects so readily from the slightest push created by conversing normally would be present and harvestable far less deep in the nose and mouth than what we're being led to believe.</p>

        <p>I know there's understandably some concern with the swabs themselves, but I had one of those done last year to go to Alaska. Really wasn't that bad. Made my eye (side tested) water a little, but not bad. Borderline preferable to the 5-10 minutes conjuring spit, swab concerns aside.</p>

        <p>Say you will only do the test via the throat. That's what I have done, and I've had to take about 6 tests so far. I'm always adamant I will only do the test that way and it's been fine. Throat swab is just as accurate/valid.</p>

<p>Very simple deal just relax. It feels kind of weird and your nose may feel funny for a few hours after but it’s really not painful at all, at least in my experiences of getting it.</p>

        <p>The more relaxed you are, the easier it is. Had one done last year, it’s strange and REALLY ticklish, but that is all. The more you make it a monster in your head, the worse. Just relax, deep breath before - it should take around 30 seconds. I felt like sneezing all the time!! That was the hardest</p>

        <p>I’ve had several. No. Just the test was not painful at all. They stock a cotton swab way up your nose. To me it was uncomfortable but lasted a split second, it only made me want to sneeze.</p>

        <p>I've had it done twice (once for surgery) - the first one was not bad at all (in and out in a second or two), but the second one (done in December) I swear the nurse was up there digging and digging and digging.  I was talking to another nurse afterwards asking WTF was that - saying it was totally different than my first one.  She said they changed the technique and now need to go deeper and longer - almost like they are going to dig and swab until they find something!</p>
<p>That being said, in the big scheme of things it is really not bad.  Not painful - just uncomfortable and then it is over.  No biggie.</p>

        <p>I got one earlier this year. I reckon experiences vary based on nose size/shape, experience of the nurse giving it, and personal tolerance levels. For me, it was 100% underwhelming, lol. </p>
<p>It doesn’t really go “up” your nose, it goes to the back of it. I didn’t feel a thing when she put it in, and she warned me it’d tickle when she pulls it out—it felt kinda fuzzy, but I didn’t even sneeze. Felt perfectly normal afterwards. I wouldn’t dread it if I ever have to get another. There are way worse tests I’ve had to sit through. The biggest key is to relax your entire body; I put my head back assuming that’d make things easier for the nurse (no idea if it makes a difference, but it all ended up okay, lol). </p>
<p>And that’s assuming you even get the “worst” test. My SO had to get surgery earlier this year and they just did a shallow swab in the bottom of his nostril. There are saliva ones now, too. They might be able to work with you if you just can’t handle the traditional kind.</p>
