    <strong>Is there a collection of the relevant parts of the Fauci emails?</strong>
    <p><p>I know it's all linked in this sub or that I could just use google, but I'd like to have a comprehensive overview about the relevant parts of the Fauci emails, so that I can easily read through it but even more important, that I can easily link to.</p>
<p>Does anyone know such a collection?</p></p>

        <p>I’ve read as much of the emails as I can and they really aren’t that damning. The worst I could find were:</p>
<p>One page 3187, he’s first shown the lab-leak theory, and he sends it along to another researcher for more information</p>
<p>On pages 3147 and 3123 he receives emails with links to a study from India that claims the virus was spliced with HIV to spread more, but he debunks it and points out it’s not peer-reviewed, published, and didn’t stand up to replication. He links them to a debunking article.</p>
<p>On page 3087 he identifies for another researcher the background of the virus, explaining the likelihood of it coming from a bat and/or pangolin at a Wet Market.</p>
<p>Bonus: On page 1770 he reacts to merch made in his image.</p>
<p>Here are the pages of the leaked emails: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561-leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails?fbclid=IwAR2aZUmNotVdU_RuTrXaXH2jqSOOkQP7Mi-pf8C6K87nU_jD2eyXeKjzARU (they’re in reverse-chronological order)</p>
<p>He said he didn’t think masks were needed and that symptomatic spread was the largest means for transmission, but that was on February 5th, a month before COVID hit the US, two months before we had solid data, and three month before the NIH updated their recommendations with the new published data.</p>

        <p>&rt;I’ve read as much of the emails as I can</p>
<p>Thanks for doing that! That work is much appreciated.</p>
<p>i guessed it wouldn't be soo bad, but I had to ask anyway. At least now I know which pages people seem to talk about the most and how much of a "proof" they really are.</p>
<p>Therefore another big Thank You for replying. You saved me a ton of work.</p>
<p>The T-Shirts and his reaction are actually the best find :-)</p>

        <p>I agree, I didn't find the emails groundbreaking considering this was before the US was hit with the virus across the country.</p>

        <p>What I find suspicious about the emails is how much is redacted from them. God only knows what the redactions are hiding.</p>
<p>Other than him originally recommending against masks (a fact we knew already), there’s not much in the emails. That we can see, anyway.</p>
