    <strong>What's gonna happen when too many of us refuse the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Any theories what happens next? There's already talk here in NZ about the government making their covid tracer app mandatory since hardly anyone is using it. lol. Our capital city just reinstated level 2 restrictions a few days ago over 1 positive case that flew from Sydney then flew back. 1 case that didn't even originate from here. (Absolutely insanity!) We have had no new community cases in over 100+ days. The government has been criticized over a slow vaccine rollout (which is actually hilarious) They've said the general population will start getting the vaccine from the end of July. I seriously question the timing of the level 2 restrictions being reinstated. I'm fully expecting another bullshit nation wide level 3/4 lockdown at some point to bump up the vaccination rate, since they know vaccine uptake has been low. I've heard about how they're having to throw out doses because people in group's 2 and 3 just aren't showing up.</p></p>

        <p>I am just a random person on the Internet who really doesn’t know what the hell is coming but I feel like there’s going to be a massive push especially in the fall when children go back to school and more people start going back to work. I am imagining a bunch of pharmaceutical company representatives and government officials sitting around a table with a platter of donuts and bagels and fresh fruit and bottled water and coffee talking about which segments of the population they can force this on with the least amount of struggle. This will be children, people that work in healthcare, people that work in education, people that work in retail, any jobs that have to deal with the public. All professional athletes, people in nursing homes etc. Those of us who make it without taking it are probably going to have more of our privileges removed. Traveling is going to be harder there will be more demands and conditions on it. That’s going to play into the whole climate crisis bullshit As well. People need to realize that it’s all tied into the same scheme. These issues are not separate they inter-dependent. Everything going on is deliberately happening to Destabilize us. It’s to frighten people and make them turn to daddy government for protection. They want us to be scared and vulnerable.</p>
<p>All of that said I think we need to remain strong and realize that a lot of people do see what this is. Of course we don’t run the media so we are not hearing about one another. It feels like we are alone and there are very few of us but that’s not the case as you can see by that protest in London this weekend. There are millions of us who feel this way. I have no real basis for saying this and I could be completely wrong but I feel in my gut that all of this is going to fail. Maybe it will happen eventually one day in the years to come but I don’t think it’s going to happen this time. Seeing parents freaking out at school board meetings has been a good sign. People are getting fed up. There is an overall feeling of frustration and anger permeating the atmosphere lately. I think we have some more very bad times ahead but we will come through this. We have to stay strong and stick to our values and principles. Just know that you are the target of one of the largest psyops ever perpetuated on mankind. You will be feeling completely demoralized and hopeless and that’s exactly how they want you to feel so don’t let yourself go there.</p>

        <p>maybe not a popular opinion but i'm trying to stay optimistic. i think most of the political objectives of the pandemic have already been achieved and the people who were able to exploit the crisis have already made themselves very wealthy from it. anything else is just seeing what we will comply with.</p>
<p>in america there will be no mandatory vaccine because they know shit will pop off and i believe it would. and i really don't think even politicians want that so hopefully we can all be smart and it won't come to that. eventually covid will join the rotation of mundane viruses that we deal with every cold/flu season and people will get bored and move on. fingers crossed anyway.</p>
<p>but absolutely do not allow any digital checkpoint app to take hold because i'll just remind you that 9/11 air travel guidelines are still in place 20 years later despite never having done shit or fuck all to stop terrorism. you will never be rid of it.</p>

        <p>The ambivalence toward vaccines and the tracer App should tell them mandating either will go “really well” for them. </p>
<p>Instead of seeing the passive aggressive lack of consent for what it is, they’re likely to double down and force NZ. Hopefully then, this country will wake up to the current Govt. initiatives.</p>

        <p>It's simple but you'll need numbers. If people are saying no to the jabby-jabby, then they also need to start saying no to the lockdowns. And then start saying no to the tracing apps. Snowball effect.</p>

        <p>I think that is already happening, except the media reports it as if everyone is getting vaccinated to add peer pressure to the mix. I'm not super popular or anything but out of the 200 or so people I talk to at least bi weekly, 10 have had their vaccine. </p>
<p>When anything not fitting the agenda is censored, then the numbers they present are also 🐃💩. When "informed consent" and copy-pasted info off peer reviewed medical journals is banned and deemed "vaccine hesitancy" then it's pretty obvious they will just continue to lie.</p>
<p>Remember social media is a DARPA program monitored by the NSA as a real-time reaction to everything. With social media, they can see people thoughts and reactions, and fully realize just how far the envelope can be pushed and in what direction. The more people depend on social media and less on IRL interactions, the more freedoms will evaporate due to a belief in a digitally curated reality of falsehoods.</p>
<p><em>in the end, this feels like a push that requires a movement, not just sitting and waiting it out</em></p>

        <p>The vaccine passports won't happen, and if they do happen, they will be required only for a few months and later scrapped (cancelled). </p>
<p>You see, the talk of these IDs and passports circulating in the news are just propaganda scare mongering to intimidate the population into getting vaccinated. The vaccinated people get vaxxed because i wAnNa bE aBlE tO fLy aNd geTs mUh nOrMaL bAcK. Israel and Denmark, even the UK already scrapped the vaccine IDs and passports once they reached 70% vaccination targets. The fear mongering of this "passport" or "ID" will be ramped up vigorously until the majority of nations populations are at least 70- 80% FULLY VACCINATED. </p>

        <p>I am by no means an expert, but upon observing the situation intensely for the past year and a half, this is what I think. The government already has achieved everything they hoped and dreamed for. China is now the dominant super power, given that they unleashed a genetically altered virus onto the world and could do it again at the drop of a hat. The United States is a complete joke, as toxic cultural marxism and wokeism are destroying national pride and making people hate their country. That being said, all governmental power has been established. However, I am trying to be optimistic too. </p>
<p>Regarding the United States, there are too many people that outright refuse to get the vaccine. Period. Under no circumstances. When you have people that would rather die than get the jab, it makes it difficult to impose the jab over the entire society. There will be bribery, peer pressure, fearmongering, etc. but at the end of the day, the sane ones know that getting the jab does not mean "returning to normal". In a sense though, the vaccines are already mandatory, particularly in higher-education. You have to get the jab in order to attend university (unless you can get a religious or medical exemption, which are difficult/impossible to get depending on what state you live in), and soon it will be mandatory to go to public school (K-12). Businesses are requiring their employees to get it and other random activities that people want to do are requiring vaccination. </p>
<p>I think that it is nearly impossible to impose universal vaccines. The amount of money and effort is overwhelming. Plus, asking someone if they are vaccinated is a violation of their medical privacy and therefore you run into legal issues. With the adverse effects of the jab exploding on VAERS, corporations are tip toeing around the issue because they don't want to get sued. What they will do though, is have booster shots every quarter, so Pfizer and Moderna can make more money from their "vaccine cash cow". The COVID "vaccine" is a Trojan horse for Big Pharma, so that they will be able to run rough shot over the FDA and consumers. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, most Americans (speaking from experience, but I am sure it is the same in other parts of the world) have the attention span of a nat when it comes to "breaking news". Something else will come up, like another "white supremacist/terrorist" attack or some ridiculous nonsense that the wokeist drool over and COVID will fall by the wayside. It is going to be more difficult because the MSM is like a dog with a bone when it comes to COVID news, but I think it will happen. <strong>Society has already returned to normal, vaccinated or unvaccinated. The MSM wants you to think otherwise.</strong> I think having the Olympics and the Tour de France, two of the largest sporting events worldwide, will help push out this Delta variant bullsh*t that the MSM is spewing.</p>
