    <strong>Court Intrigue at the CDC</strong>
    <p><p>Some interesting departures from CDC leadership.    </p>

<p>Buried lede:  </p>
<p>"Overall, the changes Walensky is putting in place at the agency will strengthen the authority of the CDC director and the agency’s independence. A senior Biden administration health official described the CDC’s reshuffle to Politico as “a long time coming.”</p>
<p>“When Biden entered office, there were some very early conversations about how the CDC was going to be handled... who was going to lead it and what it needed to do to get back on track,” the senior health official said. “Dr. Walensky was chosen for the top job and was highly sought-after. But I think it is fair to say there have been some hiccups over the last few months that have created some tensions within the agency. And I think we’re starting to see the CDC director make some moves to change things.”</p></p>

        <p>Both the Wikipedia article about Walensky and this "anonymous official" remind us that she was so highly sought-after and qualified.</p>
<p>It's just the Left trying to speak something into existence.</p>
<p>She's an academic from Harvard of all places -- it's kind of perfect, actually, since the Ivy League is an entrance to a glorified network of bureaucratic circlejerking.</p>
<p>From a different perspective, the rats are fleeing the ship at the CDC, and the clown who is in charge of it looks like a moron. Six weeks ago she had a "sense of impending doom" replete with big "please believe my appeal to emotion" doe eyes... now everything is changed? Please. No credibility left.</p>
