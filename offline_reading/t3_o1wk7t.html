    <strong>Work gave me an ultimatum</strong>
    <p><p>So I got an ultimatum from my work yesterday that was either you have to be vaccinated or have a vaccine appointment scheduled by June 30. I just don't see the point in myself getting one due to my age, medical history, etc., However it seems there is no budging from them. And I am not in a position to even find a new job, because my fiancée is pregnant and due in early August, so idk what company would hire someone on knowing they will go on paternity leave in a month and a half of joining. Also benefits sometimes don't even apply for 3 months anyways, so worried about being able to get my family covered. I am so lost and confused of what I should do, I really don't want to get the vaccine, but I feel like there is no choice due to my life circumstances at the moment. I mean we have been working remotely for 18 months I don't know why they are bringing us back, like I would rather wear a face shield gloves and double mask then get the vaccine. I just wish I could find a good paying job (at least 22/hr) that has healthcare covered or mostly covered no vaccine required preferably remote but one that would hire someone that would need to use FMLA immediately... Like I'm hoping my company has a mass exodus and they reverse their decision but I don't believe they will ... I can't believe I'm going to be coerced info getting the damn vaccine </p>
<p>And idk if they are allowing religious of philosophical exemptions only medical as far as I'm aware</p>
<p>UPDATE so apparently the first dose needs to be done by 6/30 and I can try to get a religious exemption, but HR said personal exemptions won't be acknowledged and most philosophical exemptions can be semantically used to be a personal exemption I doubt they will allow religious exemption. So I am more than likely going to have to get the damn shot and part of me hopes I get a bad reaction and can sue my employer for forcing it on me</p></p>

        <p>I might try that, like schedule it a couple weeks away then tell them I have to reschedule due to my fiancée having an OB appointment, then just keep rescheduling until I go on leave - hopefully I can play that game for a month with them</p>

        <p>You can say it was against your religious beliefs and if anything happens you're suing them for damages. Then schedule an appointment (as far off as you can) and use that time to find new work or prepare to leave basically. Don’t go to the appointment, but there’s a few card templates online already... so I’m sure you can use your left hand, come up with Dr. Pradesh or Dr. Lee, and some random dose number in case they do a cursory check. But do aim to leave, as they’re clearly intent on trying to force you into taking it against your will. That alone should be subject to a lawsuit for human rights...</p>

        <p>Wait.</p>
<p>What do you have to lose?</p>
<p>If you go through with it, you've taken the vaccine. You might be totally fine! But we have no way of knowing. We know even less about the long term effects.</p>
<p>But if you fake it, you may get around it.</p>
<p>Now, you might get caught. And you might get fired. But at least you won't have the shot, and at least you have a shot at skipping it!</p>
<p>I feel for you though. My boss, the lone holdout at my company, just got the vaccine. I fear that they'll be requiring vaccines as well.</p>
<p>I empathize with your position, and understand why you feel you have no choice, but I know I won't be getting the shot either way. They can fire me. Their loss.</p>
<p>I WILL NOT SUBMIT to this bullshit tyranny.</p>

        <p>I would fake it, and then pretend to get super sick from taking it and blame your employer. Talk about legal action and try to get co workers on board too. Maybe contact your local news and tell them about it.</p>
<p>People asking you to get vaccinated can go to hell. If you're not a doctor you shouldn't be giving medical advice, and if you are recommending medical procedures you should be held liable if something goes wrong.</p>

        <p>I really feel for you. I got vaccinated yesterday because my job gave me the same ultimatum (July 12 fully vaccinated). I work for a very large company and figured they have HR with enough power to know if my card was faked or not. I also didn’t want to risk losing shifts or my current position due to “restructuring” when really it was because I’m not vaccinated. There is simply no other work I am qualified for to make the money that I do. I even took another job part time to see if it would be comparable - it wasn’t. </p>
<p>Truly a mind fuck that some of us have been put into this situation at the mercy of giant corporations... but then again... haven’t we always been...</p>

<p>So wait if I were to get a job in January I find out my partner is pregnant in February I can't use FMLA for that? It's not like the situation I'm in now where I know within 6 months of getting the job I'm going to have to use it, I literally had no idea when I got the job that Oct/Nov I would need to take leave... Wow that is extremely fucked up, gotta love federal laws /s</p>

        <p>As a person who does a lot of trust falls, if you feel you are doing the right thing not doing what they say, leave that company. As weird as it is when we take our power in this world doors open up as others close. It's only the uncertainty that's scary, you might struggle for a short time but it's okay. I left my crap ass factory job because they were forcing masks on me. I just had a kid earlier this year but I hate being forced to fall in line, it was crap and I can handle crap jobs but when you add on the level of obedience they wanted, I just couldn't do it.  I was making much more than I do now(maintence for small apt complex) I'm so much happier now and I get to do and learn so much more. Trust falls are scary but falling in line with evil is worse.</p>

        <p>Not to be grim here, but fuck that shit. I mean, what if you do decide to take the vaccine and it does some serious damage to your health? You can't take that back once you go through with it and honestly you have a fiancee and baby to think about. We keep hearing about the horrible side effects people have been getting from this "vaccine"; do you really want to take the chance of being one of those? If it disables you, how will you be able to support your family? I know it sounds bad and I'm not trying to be the grim reaper here, but there is always another side of things that need to be considered. </p>
<p>I know you're in a tough spot and I really feel for you, but if your instincts are telling you not to take the shot, always trust your instincts. It would be terrible to have something happen to you medically that you can't take back, you don't deserve that. Fuck those people who are trying to force you! Make them sign a paper saying they accept full liability in the chance that something happens to you so they will compensate you and your family. Fuck this tyranny!

        <p>A friend of mine was in the same spot. Pregnant wife entirely dependent on his income and insurance, mortgage, covid puppy, all of it. His workplace railroaded him too. He was one the healthiest ppl. He's now having seizures and blackouts. His wife had the baby a month early, a couple of days after his 2nd shot. She did complain about breathing a lot, but never correlated it. His wife's family all did it and some had extreme fatigue but were eventually fine. The thing with these shots is that you just don't know what will happen. His MIL moved in to drive him to and from work. I don't know anything else about his health because he won't text about it now. I do get baby pics, so the baby is doing well. Good luck, OP, with whatever decision you make.</p>

        <p>Dude think of the big picture. A company like this isn't going to take care of you in the long run, a company like this one will arbitrarily fire you without warning as they please, even knowing you have a family to feed. Please prioritize your self/health and don't feel pressured to make this Auschwitz style decision, you shouldn't have too. </p>
<p>I would say, keep working to June 20th and write a letter to your boss/management that you will be taking legal action against them because you feel like your privacy was invaded. Sue them. Take care of your pregnant wife with your savings, money will come and go. I promise that a fresh new job will come to you the coming fall.</p>

        <p>I just wanted to throw out that you should never tell anyone you are going to sue them if you intend to actually do it. Let your lawyer do paperwork and notifications. </p>
<p>You want them caught unprepared and you definitely want to make sure you don’t say/write/do the wrong thing before you even start the process.</p>

        <p>Haven't sued anyone before but if he decides to end up taking this company to court for compensation (after they fire him) he should talk to an experienced lawyer. You're right though on a second look at what I wrote.</p>

        <p>It’s a hard thing to think about in the moment because you are in the mindset of being screwed over by someone who is in the wrong. You want the other party to know you are able to fight back :)</p>
<p>Not saying it isn’t really something most people think about until they learn why it is a good idea. You’ll be screwing them over more when they don’t see it coming.</p>

        <p>2 options:</p>
<p>1) Schedule the appointment and keep rescheduling it until you can go on leave. Probably your only option. </p>
<p>2) Find a corrupt doctor that will "vaccinate" you for money. By that I mean he would have to mark you as vaccinated in the database and/or forge you a vaccine certificate (I don't know how it works in the US). I don't know if that's possible though. Even if it is, it will probably cost you a couple thousand dollars. I have heard of such shady dealings in Europe. </p>

Your girl being pregnant is pretty widely accepted as a reason for you not to get the jab right now, and they are trying to use it to fire you so you don't go on baby leave.</p>

        <p>Reading your situation it seems as if toughening up and getting the vaccine is the best way. Like you said I think it is unlikely you would be able to get a new job that would be so willing to let you go on paternity leave, or even hire you in the first place. Risking your lively  hood as well as spending 3 important months with your child all because you don't want to get 1 or 2 shots would be a very stupid thing to do. I can understand why some people don't want to get the vaccine. I hate shots myself, but I still got it. I can understand really disliking it, but being immune from a virus, even if you might never have caught it without the vaccine, and in your situation, being able to work and take paternity leave, are good reasons to suck it up and get the vaccine. I doubt it will be something you regret as the negative effects of getting it are minimal compared to the positives in your situation. I really hope you decide to get it, for yourself, your child, and your fiancee, and wouldn't want any of you to suffer just because you refused to get a quick shot.</p>

        <p>It's not a fear of shots necessarily I mean I don't like shots overall...it's a moot point for me to get it, everyone I am around who is immunocompromised or elderly are vaccinated (as I believe those groups should be) but I have virtually no chance or getting it, of I get it I will (statistically) have no effects from COVID. Fauci emails stated that asymptomatic spread isn't a thing. So for me there is no point on getting a shot that decreases my likelihood of getting it by ~1% than not having the shot.</p>
