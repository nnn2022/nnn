    <strong>Why you can’t be friends with doomers.</strong>
    <p><p>Or by extension people who disagree with you politically.</p>
<p>It’s a shocking statement, I know. You want to say “of course I can be friends with people I disagree with and it’s healthy.” You’re partially right. There is nothing wrong with being friends with people with differing opinion and having fun debates. If people agreed on every thing it would be boring.</p>
<p>There is a difference however when it comes to disagreeing about the worth of a philosophy or whether an author or movie is trash. And whether or not something should be illegal.</p>
<p>Because when so someone says “that should be illegal” they are stating that “this is something I support the use of force being used in practice”.</p>
<p>Every law, no matter how minor, no matter the intent, is enforced by gunpoint.</p>
<p>People say this jokingly all the time. “Pineapple on pizza should be against the law.”  “Leaving your trash can on the corner should be against the law.” It’s funny. But why is it funny? Because of the absurdity of something that minor being met with such an overwhelming escalation.</p>
<p>Because again if pineapple on pizza is against the law then that means putting it on your pizza is at the very least an offense that will earn you a fine.</p>
<p>If you ignore the fine you will get a court date.</p>
<p>Ignore the court date and you will get a warrant.</p>
<p>Get caught with a warrant you will be arrested.</p>
<p>Resist arrest and you will be killed.</p>
<p>Because every law is enforced the same way. Seatbelt laws mean they are willing to kill you for your own good. Same with helmet laws.</p>
<p>And when people support lockdowns, masks, etc it’s exactly the same.  They are telling you that they support the state murdering you if you don’t comply.</p>
<p>That isn’t a disagreement over an author. That’s a fundamental issue. And you can’t be friends with that.</p></p>

        <p><strong>To piggyback this,</strong> their ignorance is what is enabling the regulations based on nothing but fear mongering propoganda.</p>
<p>It's hard to support someone that supports their society's demise and is too afraid or pacified by materialism and 1^st world comfort to educate themselves <em>(considering we have all of human knowledge in our pockets, there is no excuse).</em></p>

        <p>I disagree on the political. I have &amp; have had friends that don't agree on politics. As long as it doesn't get to 'cult' levels, it's fine. </p>
<p>The Doomers are a cult &amp; truly (admit) they want everyone that disagrees to die! Can't be friends with people that want me dead.</p>

        <p>I agree with this whole-heartedly. I'm a lib, one of my best friend's a conservative, we love going to the bar and shooting the shit about our different politics and what we come together on or joke about the things we don't. It depends on how serious people take themselves I think too. Anyone who is open and kind has me as a friend, I don't check voting records.</p>

        <p>Of course you can. That is what being human means. And this is how you change sh*tty ideas. The moment you give into tribal priests and politicians that tell you Iraqi hate "us" with images from Iran and that all Iranians are bad you become just another mindless tool waving a flag.</p>
