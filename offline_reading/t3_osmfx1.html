    <strong>Daily reminder for people who are close to caving in and "just getting the shot so we can go back to normal"</strong>
    <p><p>The mindset of "I'll just get the shot and I'll be able to go back to doing X" is horrible regardless of if the vaccine is harmful or not (I personally beleive it's a too high posibility that it is).</p>
<p>By giving in to their demands as they hold your liberties ransom you are not only getting the shot but you are showing the government that such tactics work. <br>
It is essentially like giving pirates money for hostages and the reason the government doesn't negotiate with terrorists. <br>
Much like how if you give those pirates just a million dollars they will spare 10 lives on the surface it seems like a good deal and a no brainer.<br>
 But then when that works they will just do it again and again with higher prices.</p>
<p>If the population gives in to such tactics who is to say they won't use them in other matters such as guns? With how things are looking, with just a few months of media propaganda they could probably get away with "Handed in weapons-cards". And the same people would be screeching about "JUST HAND THEM IN SO WE CAN GO BACK TO NORMAL".</p>
<p>God I hate the mindset of "Just do X so we can go back to normal" when the people asking you do X are the ones making the situation not normal. The fact that such a large chunk of the population accepts this, even people that identify as conservative, is truly frightening no matter where you stand on the vaccine or covid.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely, always stay vigilant. </p>
<p>Another good argument to use is "Trump got into power in 2016, would you be comfortable giving these powers to someone like trump or if they got voted back in", the answer is almsot always either trying to move goalposts or just not answering the question  but blocking or "Reported for hate speech trump supporter!". <br>
Gotta use their own propaganda against them!</p>

        <p>Yep. That thinking that you should “get it just to go back to normal” is not wise. They keep moving the goalposts. A city in California is 90% vaccinated and they just put mask mandates back in place and talking lockdowns again. Even Fauci admits the CDC is talking masks even for vaccinated people.</p>
<p>These people have NEVER kept to their word at any point during the pandemic. They always find and excuse to bait and switch. You can’t trust them.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty pissed. I moved to France about a year ago, just in time for being locked down and now this "it isn't mandatory, but really it's mandatory to be vaccinated" shit. I haven't visited home since I got here. As someone who wants to remain here, I feel like if I don't get vaccinated, at some point I won't be able to renew my carte de sejour (basically a french green card). </p>
<p>Also, I can't board a plane to go visit family. I can't take a train to even go visit other areas in France. I can't go to bars or restaurants. I can't go to the gym. I can walk around outside and go to the grocery store. That's it. Macron said it isn't "mandatory", you can get a covid test instead. But it has to be less than 48 hours old, and they will start costing money in October. So you'd be paying like 70-80 bucks every time you wanted to do anything, and there's always some risk of getting a false positive and just having to eat that train ticket.</p>
<p>I could deal with all of that. I honestly could. I can cook well, street markets are amazing here and I can get great, fresh produce just about any day of the week with a short walk from my home. I don't need bars, restaurants, travel, etc. right now, I can wait.</p>
<p>But what I can't wait on is seeing family. I've got new nieces and nephews, I want to be a part of their lives. I moved my life over here, settling down with a great girl I've been with 4+ years. I can't afford to have this fuck up my legal status here. It's so insanely frustrating to have these things held over my head.</p>

        <p>Apparently you do not realize that this is a slippery slope and that your masks do nothing. Your non-vaccine gene therapies are actively being pointed at by some VERY REPUTABLE and EXPERIENCED doctors who are saying "These things are fucking LEAKY and are driving the variants!"</p>

        <p>Currently what is being discussed in many countries is restricting non vaccinated people basic things like going to stores, public places, using trains and busses.</p>
<p>Have you not been following the news at all you absolute fucking baffoon? You think it's about masks? Politicians are talking about going door to door harrasing people that don't have vaccination papers, forcing tens of millions of people to take it or lose their jobs, making lists of people not wanting the vaccine and going after them e.t.c. and you STILL think it's about MASKS?</p>

        <p>This line of logic only works if there is an actual reason not to take the vaccine. I sincerely doubt that "TENS OF MILLIONS" of people are allergic to it, and apart from that and fully unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, there is no reason not to do this!</p>

        <p>What I said about tens of millions was about the proposed forced vaccinations of all federal workers.</p>
<p>"I sincerely doubt that "TENS OF MILLIONS" of people are allergic to it"</p>
<p>It's not about allergies (though that's a valid concern too), it's about possible long term effects. Objectivly speaking by pre-covid medical standards the vaccine is not safe. If you look at the medical trials you needed to go trough prior to covid to get a vaccine out they were rightfully long, studying long  and short term effects. There simply has not been time to see the long term effects.   </p>
<p>So let me ask you something, if the vaccine is completely safe why did the companies making them ask for (AND FUCKING RECEIVE  FOR SOME REASON) complete legal immunity to any and all side effects? Is it too much to ask for that the people making something and heavily coercing you into getting something be liable for side effects and consequenses? Hell, they won't even pay you damages and if you do die and it's legally PROVEN the vaccine is what killed you your family can still only get a maximum of about 370K.</p>
<p>Sheep like you never have have an answer to these questions, you either move goalposts or stick your fingers in your ears and go "lalalalala". Despicable beings.</p>
