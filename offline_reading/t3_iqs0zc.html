    <strong>No, Mr. Victorian Premier, It Is About Human Rights</strong>
    <p><p>Yesterday the Victorian Premier in Australia was asked about the human rights issue of implementing a curfew despite it not being recommended by government health advice. He replied 'It's not about human rights, it's about human life.' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f36CvLXhCyU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f36CvLXhCyU</a> (by the way the curfew was implemented to make police's job easier, not because of professional health advice). </p>
<p>Now this remark has convinced me that not only is this premier acting as if he is the saviour of Victoria, but he is a complete fucking idiot. There is never a situation where human rights can be bypassed because 'it's not about human rights' or because you want to save lives. Imagine that? </p>
<p>'I'm banning everyone from going out at night because most alcohol-related violence and violent crime happens at night' </p>
<p>'Human rights inherent to everyone include the ability to leave your house at night' </p>
<p>'Human rights don't matter when we can save human life'. </p>
<p>Everything is about human rights. Human rights are inherent to everyone simply by being born human. They aren't something governments can just suspend or ignore because of emergency powers or people getting sick. </p>
<p>From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from the UN (<a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/</a>) - </p>
<h4>Article 1.</h4>
<p>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.</p>
<h4>Article 2.</h4>
<p>Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.</p>
<h4>Article 5.</h4>
<p>No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment</p>
<h4>Article 9.</h4>
<p>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.</p>
<h4>Article 12.</h4>
<p>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.</p>
<h4>Article 13.</h4>
<p>(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.<br>
(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.</p>
<h4>Article 16.</h4>
<p>(1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.<br>
(2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.<br>
(3) The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.</p>
<h4>Article 19.</h4>
<p>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</p>
<h4>Article 20.</h4>
<p>(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.</p>
<h4>Article 23.</h4>
<p>(1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.<br>
(2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.<br>
(3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.<br>
(4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests</p>
<h4>Article 26.</h4>
<p>(1) Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.</p>
<h4>Article 29.</h4>
<p>(1) Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.<br>
(2) In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.<br>
(3) These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.</p>
<h4>Article 30.</h4>
<p>Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.</p>
<p>These aren't something that governments can just take away because they feel like it. These rights are not granted by governments. These rights are inherent to everyone as human beings. The only lockdowns could possibly be in line with human rights is article 25</p>
<p>(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. </p>
<p>As in everyone has the right to medical care, which could be infringed upon if the health systems were overwhelmed. But they weren't and they aren't going to be. There is no excuse for it now. Governments are purposefully withholding people's inherent rights, which is a right that they do not have. People have a right to make a living for themselves, see their family and assemble peacefully. If governments disallow them that right or police arrest people for using those rights, then they are infringing upon the universal declaration of human rights. If a country's constitution allows their governments to suspend the rights of it's citizens, then the constitution itself is infringing on fundamental human rights that it is not allowed to infringe upon and needs to be changed.</p></p>
