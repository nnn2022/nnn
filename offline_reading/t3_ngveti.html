    <strong>The Absolute Joke That Is The Death Rate in Wales</strong>
    <p><p>We had to cancel Christmas for almost no deaths. Masks are still required in most stores despite the easing of some restrictions (finally). The frog-faced twat in charge insists that social distancing and masks AREN'T going anywhere any time soon. This is a fucking joke. The town center is a haven for smack-heads now; the shit they're pumping into their systems is probably safer than the vaccines. Some businesses have had to close permanently. There is a fucking massive waiting list for the NHS. Everyone's mental health is fucked. </p>
<p>And for what? Just over 5,000 deaths, most of which were probably falsely attributed to Covid or had several comorbidities.</p>
<p>They'll say the lockdowns were a success but that's a fucking lie. Simple fact of the matter is that Wales is just more sparsely populated than England. There are a lot more rural areas where people probably don't give a fuck about all this shit. Yet here we are, in lockstep with the rest of the world, locking down and wearing masks and flailing about like it's the fucking apocalypse. </p>
<p>Can I please just have my life back now?</p></p>
