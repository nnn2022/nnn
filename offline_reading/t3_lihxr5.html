    <strong>Society's reaction to COVID isn't just bad for the economy and social life; it's making COVID itself worse!</strong>
    <p><p>Am I the only one who's observed that the lockdowns and fear is likely making COVID worse? Think about it... Below I will post my reasoning.</p>
<p>A.) <em>Countless studies show that</em> <em>emotional strain can weaken the immune system.</em></p>
<p>People are being blasted with what is essentially fear porn from the media daily. The worst possible statistics are used. This is <strong>not healthy</strong> for the emotional state of society.</p>
<p>In addition, aside from masks causing discomfort, society is hyper-aggressive and ostracizes anyone who isn't wearing one. You are now constantly either:</p>
<p>1.) Looking for people to be angry at or scared of for not wearing one,</p>
<p>2.) Feel afraid to show your face in public without being shamed.</p>
<p>...Maybe both. There is <strong>no way</strong> this is healthy for the human psyche. I could expand on this but will restrain myself.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>B.) <em>Vitamin D deficiency is one of the biggest risk indicators for COVID-19.</em></p>
<p>Having a healthy social life is at this point discouraged. Not only does this inevitably lead to depression, anxiety, etc... but staying indoors is encouraged or mandated depending on where you live.</p>
<p>You get vitamin D <strong>from sunlight</strong>.</p>
<p>Wondering why Flordia, a state full of seniors, doesn't have some massive death rate? There you go.</p>
<p>They aren't going around wearing masks, petrified of going outside. Nope, they're carrying on as if nothing is happening. <em>And it's working.</em></p>
<p>Why is no authority talking about taking supplements and trying to be healthy? Obesity, vitamin D deficiency, and compromised immunity are all huge risk factors for COVID. These are factors that are, in 99% of cases, fixable.</p>
<p>The narrative is purely about how 100% of others need to stop spreading it, so we need 100% authoritarian mandates.</p>
<p>Not a whisper about how we can make ourselves more resistant to COVID <em>naturally and consensually</em>. In fact, measures in place make our biology <em>less</em> resistant to COVID.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>C.) <em>Our response has crippled the economy.</em></p>
<p>Since the pandemic, a booming economy has become crippled. Is this because of COVID as everyone insinuates? <strong>No.</strong> It <em>is</em> <em>because of our response</em> to COVID.</p>
<p>Not only has this response wiped out countless small businesses while giving already out of control corporations a boost, the implications of which are profound.</p>
<p>Not only does this have thousands of families facing actual homelessness.</p>
<p>Not only has domestic abuse and suicide skyrocketed, <em>which is a pandemic in and of itself.</em></p>
<p>No, it's also the fact that a crippled economy means less innovation, including in biotech, which would help alleviate COVID.</p>
<p>Not to mention that it's <strong>hard to be healthy and biologically COVID resistant when you're fucking poor</strong>.</p>
<p>Society begged the Government to shut down businesses and force people to stay indoors. <em>The same Government that prevented private companies from distributing thousands of legitimate tests back in March</em>. Yeah, let's put all the power in their hands.</p>
<p>Christ.....</p></p>

        <p>If we wanted to actually help people and get better we would not be encouraging panic. Everyone learns from a young age that panic isn't a good thing. It's very clear to me that the people making decisions are invested in continuing this charade for a while.</p>

        <p>100%. It has become pure propaganda. Meanwhile, those being brainwashed tell anyone who has a different view that they've been "consuming misinformation!"</p>
<p>I watched a pretty great animated video on how much of the population is suggestible vs not suggestible. Extremely relevant, might post later.</p>

        <p>Please share, it sounds fascinating. </p>
<p>Kind of goes with what I said the other day too - you really only need a very minor but reliable portion of the population to agree with you. You can then cherry pick data and encourage behavior as you see fit, and create the impression of conformity.</p>

        <p>Yup, on point A I read an article about how <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/anxiety-about-coronavirus-can-increase-the-risk-of-infection-but-exercise-can-help-133427">stress can weaken your immune system but exercise can help</a>. So naturally Tom Wolf shut down every gym in PA when cases were spiking (Also gyms aren’t key spreaders). “Follow the science” 🙄</p>

        <p>Those clowns of politicians don't read science. They don't even read the bills the pass or veto! Not even exaggerating. </p>
<p>Most of the people parroting "follow the science" don't read the science, either. In rare cases, they may actually go to https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ and look at scariest numbers without actually thinking about them.</p>

        <p>Interesting points, it is veyy clear that our governments do not care for the health of their citizens, and what they are doing right now is proof of this, whatever guise it is under. In addition to this, our chances of developing natural herd immunity are hindered by the fact we slow the spread among the majority of the population who are not at risk of severe cases and death. We are slowing down getting there, if not blasting our chances completely.</p>

        <p>I've been saying this for a while now... I live in a college town (a <strong>party</strong> college town). So inevitably, when it was announced that our university's football team would be playing 6 games last season, we all knew there would be parties. Everyone I heard talking about the subject were referring to these parties as "super spreader events." </p>
<p>Meanwhile I'm here thinking, "Since healthy college kids are the LEAST likely to have a serious case of COVID or any lasting effects from it, wouldn't it make since for them to spread it all around amongst themselves <em>while they're off at college not visiting or seeing or being around grandma for a few months</em> so they can get it over with and get immune? Like how I had to go to 'chicken pox parties' when I was little?"</p>
