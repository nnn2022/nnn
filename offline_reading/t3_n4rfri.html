    <strong>Censorship at its finest - the Curious Case of Dr Mercola's Decision to DELETE all his work related to Covid-19 due to...Threats Against his Person?</strong>
    <p><p>Dr Mercola has spent years building up a loyal following of people who value his down-to-earth advice and science-backed recommendations that have provided many of us lots of ways to live healthier. Early in the Covid pLandemic, <strong>Dr Mercola was initially a believer in face masks and social distancing,</strong> however it didn't take long for him to realize that the entire charade was a scam designed to advance the Great Reset Agenda and help Gates/Fauci/Big Pharma force us all into a Lifetime Program of Vaccines Forever. </p>
<p>As a result, Dr Mercola became a powerful voice against the Covid Globalists and he did a lot of great work pointing out the benefits of IMMUNITY DEFENSE as a possible way to combat Covid-19 for most people who don't want to take experimental vaccines. Because he was so successful as reaching people and because his advice made so much sense, Dr Mercola became a target for the Big Pharma Great Reset crowd to take down. </p>
<p>&rt;<strong>SHOCKINGLY, it seems the Technocrats have won!</strong></p>
<p>Today on Dr Mercola's blog was this article: <a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/05/04/removing-articles-related-to-vitamin-d-c-and-zinc.aspx">https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/05/04/removing-articles-related-to-vitamin-d-c-and-zinc.aspx</a></p>
<p>In his words "Until now I have refused to succumb to the governmental and pharmaceutical thugs relentless attacks. I have been confident and willing to defend myself in the court of law, as I’ve had everything reviewed by some of the best attorneys in the country. Unfortunately, <strong>threats have now become very personal and have intensified</strong> to the point I can no longer preserve much of the information and research I’ve provided to you thus far. These <strong>threats are NOT legal in nature, and I have limited ability to defend myself against them</strong>."</p>
<p>I'm saddened by this turn of events - if it can happen to well-established social influencers like Dr Mercola, what hope do the rest of us peons have when we want to raise our voices against Big Brother? </p>
<p>Is our future really to end like Winston Smith's - will we all be forced to "Love Big Brother" in order to survive in the new new normal world? </p>
<p>Say it ain't so!</p></p>

        <p>Personally, 'very personal threats against my person' would just make me call the police and tell them "Do your jobs, find these people and arrest them!" and would make me post the stuff the people took issue with in more places.</p>

<p>The man is dealing with very big fish in the sea of danger, corruption and lies.</p>
<p>The police would not be able to do anything substantial.</p>
