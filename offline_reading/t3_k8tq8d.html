        <p>With those businesses closed I wonder how the property taxes are going to paid in the long term in these major cities.  I did a bot of googling and Chicago's solution is to instate a $95 million tax hike. They have a 1.2 billion budget shortfall already. These dems are delusional to the extreme just extorting and printing money at every turn. </p>

        <p>Let me preface this by saying that I HATE the professional managerial class as much as anyone. But, I'm sick of seeing things like this post. It's a bunch of mindless, bitter complaining predicated on a completely incorrect premise that sets up a fake problem that is eventually going to get solved to the extreme detriment of the people of this country.</p>
<p>The $1,200 was explicitly meant as a stimulus payment. A stimulus is not meant to be assistance for individuals. Things like extended and/or supersized unemployment benefits, increased welfare payments, rent freezes, eviction freezes, etc. are meant to be assistance for individuals. Stimulus checks are meant to help "the economy" (in theory, especially local businesses). People were explicitly intended to spend that money recklessly and immediately within their communities to replace the money that they were not otherwise spending because of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic. </p>
<p>There are many, many complaints to be had about this stimulus. For example, what was the point if most local economies were forced to be shut down and you couldn't really spend it there? Doesn't that mean it's really just a handout for large, multinational companies like Amazon, Target, Walmart, Home Depot, etc. that were already doing crazy business thanks to their local competition being forcibly closed by a corrupt state? Why was getting a stimulus check means-tested? The recipient of the check was supposed to go make it rain at local restaurant. What does the income of the rain-maker have to do with anything? And so on and so on...</p>
<p>There are also many complaints to be made about the inconsistencies and quantities of programs meant to actually provide assistance to individuals. I am sure many people that got the stimulus check used it as personal assistance instead of stimulating their local economy or even those multinationals. I'm sure many used it to pay bills or service debts. Still, the shortcomings of those programs do not change the point of a stimulus program. No politician supported the stimulus as a supersecret backdoor to provide amazing aid to individuals. They were able to come together to vote to stimulate "the economy". They were not able to come together to consistently assemble packages to assist individuals struggling due to problems the politicians themselves created.</p>
<p>Bitterly ignorant tweets like this do not help anyone and they set up a false problem that these same politicians will be happy to solve (to the delight of Amazon, Target, Walmart, Home Depot, etc.) once it becomes useful for them to stop not solving it, i.e. presumably when Trump is no longer the President. Instead of an actual aid package aimed at people actually struggling due to the ridiculous pandemic policy decisions, we'll get more "stimulus" that will probably hit a fair number of people actually struggling because of this, but will also go to a lot more people that aren't struggling at all and, since all these crippling restrictions are set to continue indefinitely, pretty much all of that will go towards Amazon, Target, Walmart, Home Depot, etc. It will be incredibly expensive and exacerbate pretty much every problem this country is currently facing. Please consider that before amplifying shit like this.</p>

        <p>I don't care about laboratory science of masks anymore so don't bother linking any snarky articles. There are places that have mandated them for months that have had no effect. Take LA, it is ridiculous to think that LA isn't wearing masks religiously. They just went back into lockdown. Masks don't work.</p>

        <p>Fun fact for you: Not everyone is going to follow rules regardless. People under 21 drink. Shit happens and sometimes it doesn't. And so people aren't going to follow lock down. So "logical" democrats call for tyrant laws that put people at risk of poverty, starvation, suicide, abuse, etc. I'm guessing you only watch liberal propoganda that shows anti maskers, but if you actually did some unbiased research, a lot of anti-lockdown small businesses require masks and social distance. But wait, that doesn't matter now does it because lock downs keep happening.</p>
