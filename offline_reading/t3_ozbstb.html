        <p>When I did the analysis on the PHE data and alpha variant, I put together a predictive model of where deaths ought to be given the vaccination rates in the over 50 category.  I assumed 0% death for 90% of the vaccinated population and a similar death rate for the other 10%. </p>
<p>The actual deaths in this group were not only higher than predicted.  They were about 10% higher than would have been expected in the unvaccinated population (using prevaxx data).  </p>
<p>This however did not hold up in the under 50 group, which was much closer to the predicated level of the model.  There are only two explanations that I could think of: 1) people in the vaxxed group are less likely to get tested for mild illness, therefore there is a reduced denominator effect foe the the severe and death cases.  Or, ADE is actually happening.  ADE would be predicted to be worse as immunity wanes which would explain why the older group (who has been vaxxed earlier and in larger proportions) fared worse than the younger group.  </p>
<p>The other explanation is that we are still counting people who died "with" Covid as people who died "of" Covid.  Obviously older folks would skew this quite a bit.</p>
