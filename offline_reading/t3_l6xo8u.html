<title>How do you counter the concept that if the public willingly restricted their movement and cooperated with lockdowns as Australia, NZ and Asian countries did, we'd have nornmal lives by now? And so we need to shut ourselves down now and stay home except for pharmacy and grocery purchases?</title>

    <p><p>I realize the issues of Asian countries, Australia and NZ have been discussed, but on facebook social groups and other regions of interest, it's still fairly nonstop clamoring about how well Asia, Australia and NZ are doing and how Westerners with their insistence on moving around and not staying home are going to be the reason we lose all of 2021 and maybe even some of 2022.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A quotation from one of them about the country we're in: </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>" We have so far had 3 incompetently-implemented lockdowns. If we had had even 1 properly done, we could be like New Zealand now, or Australia: life almost back to normal.</p>
<p>Instead we're desperately hoping we can vaccinate our way out of the deep, deep hole we're in. And maybe we can - right up until a mutation appears on the scene that the Pfizer vax is not effective against.</p>
<p>(But please, spare me this "crime against humanity" crap.)"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What are the primary current ways we have of countering this, given what the data says about viral spread and deaths due to the pandemic vs indirectly due to shutdowns?  Or maybe it's just better to disregard what FB groups have to say entirely as they're most likely to be populated by overindulged, white collar and or protected classes who have disproprtonate protection from the lockdown effects?</p></p>

        <p>Because if Australia or New Zealand finds one new case, they will lock down again, and this has happened multiple times. I don't think zero covid is possible.</p>

        <p>It has nothing to do with lockdown stringency and everything to do with how soon you cut off the outside world and start tracing.  By the time we even considered any of this, covid had been circulating for months.  It was far too late for any such measures.</p>
<p>A "real lockdown" is impossible.  It takes millions of people working every day to let others stay at home with functioning utilities, internet, package and food delivery, fire/rescue/police, medical facilities and their enormous support staff structure, etc.  The only "real" lockdown stops all of that and includes the largest military deployment in history to make sure people stay in their homes or are punished if not.  And their logistical train.....   It just doesn't work.</p>
<p>Additionally, it would take WEEKS or MONTHS of lockdown to actually kill off a cold.  There was an antarctic cold outbreak 17 weeks after they closed for the season. </p>
<p>This kind of shutdown would be catastrophic if followed, but would undoubtedly lead to actual, literal, civil uprising.  People would be starving to death, and wouldn't accept "just another month!"</p>
<p>It really does seem like any lockdown of any magnitude to stop a cold will be worse than the impacts of the cold.</p>

        <p>New Zealand closed their borders to international travel early.  Here we didn't, because it was seen as too "racist".</p>
<p>But the real point is, every country is pursuing the wrong strategy.  Every country is hellbent on complete eradication of the virus.  That will not happen any time soon.</p>
<p>So NZ is great now.  What happens when they get another case?  I guess lock down again?  Then open back up, then get another case.  Then what, lock down again?</p>
<p>It's the same shortsighted strategy our governments are employing as well.  "Let's lock down, and hope everything goes away.  Yay!"</p>
<p>So the ultimate point is as follows: What is the endgame here?  </p>
<p>The vaccine won't save us.  They've already said even if you get the vaccine you can still transmit the virus.  </p>
<p>So what's the endgame?  We lock down, bring down the count.  And...  Then what?  It comes back, the count goes back up, and we have to lock down again.  We haven't solved anything.</p>

        <p>This. NZ is a small island that is heavily based on tourism and international trade. Their draconian lockdowns mean they will never be able to reopen to tourism and trade. How is that a win for them?</p>

        <p>Speaking as someone who has been travelling all over Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, the whole year, even during the absolute peak of cases and deaths, every single person was wearing a mask and following the lockdown (well about 99.9999999999% of people) yet in all the country areas I visited, just about no one was complying with any restrictions and had no cases or deaths. So how do lockdowns and restrictions work if they were the people getting the most cases and deaths?</p>
