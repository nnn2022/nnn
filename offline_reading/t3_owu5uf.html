    <strong>Hypothesis: how do the unvaccinated affect the vaccinated?</strong>
    <p><p>Unvaccinated people who are comfortable with their choice, affect vaccinated people who are uncomfortable with their choice, in the fact that the fear of peer / social condemnation is either negligible or nonexistent with the unvaccinated, whereby it’s one of the largest drivers for the vaccinated.
Social media amplifies peer pressure very heavily for those whose only view of activism and moral agency is to post on social media in their echo chamber.</p></p>

        <p>Nothing. They spread covid at the same rate, and they have the same protection against it. It’s mostly social engineering to put one group against another</p>

        <p>If they weren’t testing vaccinated people for Covid because they were under the The absolute that you couldn’t get Covid anymore and people were roaming around with their new version of Covid and the reason they would give it to some unvaccinated people which would make the numbers look bigger than it really is since we’re not really testing the vaccinated people so</p>
<p>Plus on top of that it’s an mRNA vaccine and you’re administering it to people who have already gotten Covid which may change the DNA structure of the original Covid create this variance that they’re talking about</p>

<p>Please elaborate</p>
<p>&rt;    in the fact that the fear of peer / social condemnation is either negligible or nonexistent with the unvaccinated</p>
<p>Yup, threats of having our livelihood taken away from us and being relegated to second class citizens is totally negligible peer and societal pressure to conform and bow to the authoritarians. </p>
<p>&rt;    whereby it’s one of the largest drivers for the vaccinated. </p>
<p>Nobody is forcing these people to care so much about what strangers on Twitter say. </p>
<p>&rt;    Social media amplifies peer pressure very heavily for those whose only view of activism and moral agency is to post on social media in their echo chamber.</p>
<p>Again, nobody is telling these people to spend unhealthy amounts of time and place ridiculous amounts of importance on the irrelevant opinions of strangers</p>

        <p>I pay more attention to social behavior than the average person because understanding cues and socialization doesn’t come natural to me.  I was assessed with high functioning autism.  This being said I’ve learned the rules and practice all the time.   Not to say I’m not wrong in my “conspiratorial lens” sometimes.  :) This is a hypothesis that I try and test.
That being said I watch very closely and the tendency for non-vaccinated people to be comfortable and less vocal with their choice to avoid the shot does not sit well with the vaccinated.  There is much more unsolicited, open condemnation of the non-vaccinated by the vaccinated.  It seems that those that were vaccinated on average are not as comfortable with their choice and need more validation.  This parity is being exploited heavily by all crisis entrepreneurs.
