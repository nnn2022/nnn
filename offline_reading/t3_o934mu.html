        <p>Okay so 57% percent fully vacinated,  you count that as an even steven or is that so much that it will skew the data:P? And what have more contagious to do with more deaths? Usually if virus gets more contagous it gets less severe.  Also vaccine was supposed to get 100% protection from death or severe sicknes (we are not talking about those who apperently got covid even though vaccinated, thats another question) as it was told.</p>

        <p>Considet that the vaccine was promised to prohibit death even amongst the elders, also consider that every death is not a number its a sadness. </p>
<p>Contagiousness what? You mean it still is higly effective at killing (and its not either way otherwise I wouldnt write this since I had covid a couple of weeks ago). It means more than necessarily that when I virus mutates and get more contagiousness it gets less severe, now with every new variant many media says its spreads and kills easyer with every new itteration, I call bullshit and just google on this and set the google date before covid existed.</p>
<p>More resistant in what way? Its like you are reading from a catalogue trying to explain why the callers internet is not working and try to pussle it together with no real knowledge about the subject.   </p>
<p>Protection agains the disease is a totally another thing than protection agains mortality of the disease</p>

<p>"Protection from disease is directly correlated to protection from mortality. The more people are infected, the more people will die. Example: A disease with 5% mortality rate strikes a population of 20 people. These people are all random, and evenly distributed. 1 of these people die. If the disease strikes 10 people, there is a 50/50 chance that one of them will die."  -  Totally uncorrect, protection to disease is not directly correlated to protaction from mortality, if that was so half of the nordic countries would have been whiped out every corona cold season and they are not. Also check how many died before the vaccine even existed, far lower than 1% not 50/50.</p>
<p>Yes vaccine should protect people, and with that thought these vaccines have broken the world record a long time ago in direct and indirect deaths and also less or more complicated side effects (do a quick fact check whenever you want).</p>
<p>So if we just do the numbers and forget about the deaths (imagine how many who could have survived if they where given the chance for correct threatment) they are going the wrong way on all sides looking at it</p>

        <p>I just took the two top results in a fast search to prove the point on what msn said and ofcourse they are biased, thats one of the reason why all this NoNewNormal exist, eventhough this time they might have been biased at another direction (getting late here so even I wont ducktogo more for now). </p>
<p>I used the link to show the "mortality" in the delta variant since it was official stats, hence it spreads more as virus who mutates usually does (or self dies) and the mortality rate is not higher as I proposed earlier on.</p>
<p>Protection from disease is indeed correlated as if I was to be an eskimoo and live by my self I most likely would not get infected, but to use it as a causality compared to mortality when the percentage is on .xx is not ok in my book, somewhere the line has to be drawn :)</p>
<p>If one older gent say 75 years of age is double vaccinated and we have another gent that is 50 unvaccinated, how would you compare their protection and if one should humor your thinking how would you compare the mortality, who has the best chance for survival (counting out any kind of extras, lets keep it to normal healthy poeple for their age)?</p>
