    <strong>Here's a curveball:</strong>
    <p><p>Why would the government kill/harm those that are compliant while leaving all the skeptics and those who distrust the government and big pharma alive? Wouldn't getting you guys on board first be an idea a team of politicians and scientists could come up with themselves? Better yet maybe the whole idea is to spread immunity to people that are compliant THEN release the actual virus they've just been keeping in store up until now. Or even better yet everything I've said could all be a psyop to GET you to take the actually in fact dangerous vaccine and even the normal humans you see around you day to day are in on the conspiracy and secretly just want you to take the euthanasia needle. So many levels.</p>

        <p>Wall Street and the federal goverment (Canada and USA) have run an unprecedented level of money.  Ontop of that, the elite class has made tremendous amounts of money in the last year.</p>
<p>They have robbed North America since 2001, and a crash was headed our way since then.  2008 was never rectified.  </p>
<p>Covid happened and has been dealt with.  This is why everyone is waking up to the lunacy of the rules and going back to regular life.  This is why this thread exists. </p>
<p>Elites are using this as an excuse to push a totalitarian agenda to the sleeping masses through vaccine passports and turning on your fellow countryman. They are keeping us to a very short leash, creating in-fighting so that we don't look at the real problem; MONEY.</p>
<p>The imminent crash is going to be worse than the Great Depression, and after being "obedient" due to Covid people are going to be very fucking angry only to be screwed again in the next 6 months.  They're trying to scare us and distract us from all the financial terrorism they are committing.  Wall Street and Big Pharma own the media and politicians, and they're trying to keep us under lock and key so they can continue to rule.</p>
<p>This comment is going to age well. You've been warned.</p>

        <p>? You struggling financially rn dude? Im doing ok. I wouldnt consider myself rich but you seem to have money issues right now. I made 52k last year and paid 700 dollars in overdue taxes (technically only 400 if you deduct GST). I think my tax bracket is 20% or something. Point im trying to make is YOU feel robbed by the government. Taxes haven't gone up by 50% in the last few years and no police officer came to your door to break your legs. So where's all your money going?</p>

        <p>No Dude, my situation is great actually. I'm not feeling robbed at all in my situation. Not even close. </p>
<p>All I'm telling you, is the FED has racked up the largest debt known to man, and money is being parked overnight to the FED.  Struggling with both a collateral and liquidity issue at the same time. </p>
<p>They literally cant stop printing money or the cards fall.  But keep printing money and its Weimar Germany.</p>
<p>This crash is coming before Christmas 2021, and nobody is going to fucking like it.  "Covid" will be the last of our worries.</p>

        <p>Well usually people with great situations don't have issues proving that through vocabulary and inside information. I'd argue you do feel robbed, id even argue you felt a grandiose sense of being robbed when you said "they robbed north America". I live in north America. I dont feel robbed. Since when did i give you permission to speak for me? Im pretty sure the majority of the people i interact with on a day to day basis wouldn't even share that resentment for the organization that funded the literal fucking scissors used to cut their umbilical cord. </p>
<p>Want they should stop printing money? That way yours will be worth a little bit more than the guy slightly broker than you? Wasn't there supposed to be a "huge government ending market crash" earlier this year? But this time its true right?</p>
<p>I'm not the one that's worrying right now.</p>

<p>Please indulge me on how investors taking advantage of banks giving loans to people they couldn't actually fill has anything to do with mass euthanasia. Those investors all got fucked by the FED you know that right?</p>

        <p>You're going to see massive sell-offs from corporate stocks due to having too much cash AND too much margin debt.  They will be selling their positions to try and cover their debt. (Buffet, Gates, Bezos).</p>
<p>You're going to see major crash in CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) which will start to become realized at the end of the month when mortgage forgiveness ends (June 30) and will carry well into December 2021.</p>
<p>This will result in further foreclosures and job loss on the American population.</p>

        <p>Ok so first paragraph is too vague and again goes to "Bloody murder" you have to be more specific than "the corporations" and "Jeff bezos". Is it manufactures, agriculture, construction? These are all very different industries with very independent money taps, they're not all going to drop.</p>
<p>Second one is ok but again this would be similar to the 2008 crash because CMBS' deal with commercial properties instead of residential ones. Also remember that the 2008 crash was not only bailed out, but only effected banks, and people who recently got mortgages. And it doesn't even seem like the case anymore as delinquencies in the CMBS market are dropping. (And on top of that the market is smaller than the residential one).</p>
<p>Jobs stopped dropping last year and have been slowly climbing again since. it's time to get off your ass, stop collecting insurance and start looking again, that excuse isn't valid anymore. You should look for a job as a mortgage broker, you seem to know your stuff.</p>

        <p>Alrighty where should i start? Gimme all those historical accounts of governments euthanizing the people who support them while allowing all the rebels and sceptics free. Wasn't the Romans, they fell from weakness. Wasn't the brits, they've always beem supportive of those who work for them. Definitely not the Nazis, they had their own slice of heaven if you donated a bit to the war cause. Maybe it was the Egyptians? No, they're still around. Hmm Maybe the Babylonians? No No, they fell to the Persians who also enjoyed not euthanizing their population. Its possibly the Mayans? No they got conquered. </p>
<p>Well idk man, been studying history for a bit and most of the time, you're not going to believe this: most of the time, the empire's that fell, fell because they fell from Grace first. Then someone stabbed them when they were down.</p>

Discrimination, inability to get employment or attend events will be limited. Later it will get to the point where people are forced or sent to "reduction camps" where they will be brainwashed. </p>
<p>Of course they will experience resistance, every totalitarian state does.</p>

        <p>But again, why kill the large population that DOES work for you and LISTENS to you. Why not kill the portion that gives you trouble? Ill assume FEMA is building these said camps?</p>

        <p>Ah and the population that has turned on the government respects the resources given to them?</p>
<p>And yes they can always turn. But what about those who already have? What about the resistance? Shouldn't they focus on that first? It's the biggest mistake the villains make in every movie, you'd expect Biden to have seen starwars or independence day at least once.</p>

        <p>Btw you should watch what you say here, don't want to get put on a blacklist for being part of the "resistance". Do you even have a rebel patch from starwars in your house or on your person? Anyways youll have to throw away your phone and delete reddit to be part of that dude. But sacrificing that much karma to avoid "reduction camps"? Not worth it.</p>

        <p>Because it’s about long term social engineering and depopulation.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely the vaccines will kill many people as quickly as some people seem to think. It’s more likely to cause higher rates of sterility and cancer over time.</p>

        <p>For a long term plan created by an all powerful government with infinite funds they enacted it pretty quickly and disorganized, dont you think? You'd expect the people who did mkultra to be a bit more prepared wouldnt you? Or was faming cluelessness and lack of knowledge part of their plan?</p>
<p>So how exactly does one create a small dose carcinogen that has the ability to immediately give The person cancer, or be strong enough to eventually cause it? Cause normally cancer is caused by long term exposures or extreme radioactive blasts. Also, are we currently sterilizing the children who haven't hit puberty yet? Most chemical sterilizers work off of hormonal systems that those kids haven't even developed yet. I feel like they'd just piss it out. But that's right that's right, i gotta think longer term here. Those kids will eventually mature and get follow up shots. Theyll gladly sit by as their parents and family drop like flies right? </p>
<p>So where's the cutoff for who gets the killer and who gets the dummy vaccine? Your local DA? And dont worry man i don't blame you of anything besides paranoia. But either way ill be dead and youll be getting the "New Peoples Vaccine Free America" medal of honor pinned on your chest for your bravery in the Fifth battle for Chicago's west side. Who will you be fighting for if we're all dead tho?</p>

        <p>I have always doubted (and still doubt) the idea that the government is trying to kill a huge number of people.  But, it has been talked about and written about for decades...so, I'll keep the idea in the back of my mind for recurring consideration.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the real thing driving all the wildest conspiracy theories is the censorship happening on a daily basis.  People in the United States aren't used to censorship and find its presence very alarming...and rightly so.  Let people discuss the facts and the truth will present itself.</p>

        <p>And why do you think they are censoring people? All totalitiarian regimes that exist today use censorship to maintain their power and narrative. Think about it.</p>
<p>The problem is that people don't want to learn our history. Do you have any idea about the history of our financial system? Go watch Masters of Money, it's a 3.5 hour documentary from the 90's that covers it from start to then present time. You can find the whole thing on YouTube.</p>
<p>Then read or listen to <a href="https://wethescreamers.com">this</a> (it's not long) and tell me you see no parallels with today. </p>
<p>Part of the issue is that there are a lot of looney conspiracy ideas around, but in amongst them are nuggets of truth that absolutely should not be discounted.</p>

        <p>I'm hoping big tech is misguided - most likely they are colluding for the new normal.  But I'm aware they might be aiming for something worse. </p>
<p>I'll check those things out. Thanks.</p>

        <p>I know enough about our financial systems history to know it's not leading to mass economic collapse or euthanasia...... That'd kinda defeat its entire history and purpose.....</p>
<p>And where's the censorship you're talking about? You just made a disagreeing comment about how you distrust the government. Your comment is still up, no police officer came to your door. You haven't been thrown into a camp yet. So how exactly are you being censored? Your government is literally ALLOWING you to speak ill of them right now. That doesn't seem like censorship. You think thats how it works in north Korea Or any actual totalitarian dictatorship?</p>

        <p>Resentment and distrust against the government is as old as governments, not something that's "been talked about and written about for decades". Millennia man, Millennia. And rightly so, keep an eye open always. </p>

        <p>Take your blinders off.  If you had an open mind, you might actually see things for what they are. </p>
<p>The censorship is by big tech, which has chosen to take sides with the democratic party for some reason.  The government granted them special privileges in section 230 that allowed this situation to happen.  It made sense at the time the privileges were granted, but definitely needs revision now.  Can you imagine the outcry if they had chosen to side with the republican party? </p>
<p>You are conflating censorship with punishment...but since you brought it up:</p>
<p>Researchers are unable to publish research on covid-19 treatments.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/QAHi3lX3oGM </p>
<p>Medical licenses are being threatened.
 https://www.researchgate.net/post/COVID-19_Physicians_License_Threatened_because_of_Opinion_on_COVID-19_Comments </p>
<p>Journalists jobs are being threatened. </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/N4sNoKJqj7k</p>
<p>And social media has gone entirely big-brother.  YouTubers everywhere now have to dance around the use of certain keywords to avoid triggering getting flagged and removed.  Facebook "fact checkers" aren't qualified to do their jobs...and often find any opposing research to justify taking down content...even if that content is obviously wrong.  Twitter censored the president of the United States.</p>
<p>Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean that it isn't happening.  If you have seen it and you just don't care because their actions fit your world views, then you are part of the problem.</p>
