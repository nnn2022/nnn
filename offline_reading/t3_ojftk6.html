    <strong>Company survey</strong>
    <p><p>Ok guys my corporate company is doing a survey that they usually do listen and implement employee’s opinions and requests in the responses. </p>
<p>One of the questions is: “Have you ever considered leaving x?  If so why” I know a bunch of coworkers have responded with if the vaccine is mandated, they would leave etc. I want to communicate that I considered leaving when we were brought back to the office, but “mandated” we wear a mask if we’re not vaccinated. They do onsite vaccine clinics here to try to push us to get it, have given time off and even money incentives. </p>
<p>I’m trying to think of a way to accurately word and professionally communicate that I considered looking elsewhere when I heard we would all be brought back from a year remote with restrictions that should be our personally choice. </p>
<p>If there is enough of us, maybe just maybe they will change their policies. I’m next in line for a management position and if I don’t take the jab, which I won’t, I won’t be able to go on required travel. </p>
<p>I just want to clearly word it that the person reading will understand it from our point of view in the most respectful way.</p></p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>I recently completed one of these surveys at my company and put in a comment around the effect of how after x number of years this is the only time I’ve felt like my values have been significantly different than the company’s. And then listed why. </p>
<p>I know the comment was likely seen as ‘anti-vaxx’, but I’m also hoping that it was seen for what it actually is. I made it clear I was against coercion, segregation, judgement, invasion of privacy, and I said I was surprised at how the company was actively pushing media talking points. Lastly I said I was concerned about my future at the company. Didn’t specify whether it’s because I would leave or because they might fire me for not complying since I think either is possible. </p>
<p>Not sure if that helps. Good luck!</p>
