    <strong>Can't believe I just thought of this... we keep seeing these "rare" effects of the vaccine. Whether its death or horrible injury... but</strong>
    <p><p>And this is the crazy part... stay with me.</p>
<p>The entire time they were bombarding us with the propaganda that millions were dying from "the virus", we never saw ANY fucking videos of people actually suffering from it!</p>
<p>All we saw were chinese propaganda videos of people dropping dead in the street.  We saw  pictures of hospitals with scary words like, "HOSPITAL MAXED OUT!".  We saw pictures of people on ventilators.  Hospital ships were being called into large city ports to help with the overwhelming amount of sick people.  Remember the semi-trucks parked outside hospitals waiting to ship the cadavers away?  LMFAO</p>
<p>I don't remember ONE FUCKING  INTERVIEW with someone suffering from "the virus".  They just ALL died.  That was the beginning of this scam.  If they got "the virus", you couldn't talk to them anymore.  </p>
<p>ALL the people that died, were isolated in some hospital wings, put on ventilators and then killed.  Their own families were not even able to help them, witness the "virus" in action, or comfort them.  The hospitals were closed off.  The only evidence you had that anyone was ill were pictures and videos of people on ventilators, isolated from EVERYONE.</p>
<p>Thousands, millions of images of hospitals filled with people sick from "the virus" and not fucking ONE person was interviewed that HAD the illness?!</p>
<p>AND NOW... we have ACTUAL film, actual evidence, ACTUAL FUCKING PEOPLE dying and suffering from this "VACCINE" and they are everywhere.  </p>
<p>And some STILL can't fucking add 2+2?!</p></p>

        <p>My thoughts exactly. Still don't know anyone that had a bad case of covid, a few people who said they had flu symptoms. Ok, so you had the flu. But still don't know anyone that suffered from it, or died from it, or anyone that knows anyone. Yet I personally know a few people who have suffered from this vax, and I'm seeing terrible reports on the daily.</p>

        <p>I felt very different from anything I’ve had before. When I got a fever my gf made hotdogs for us and I spit mine out, the ketchup tasted FOUL, rotten. She ate hers no problem and said the ketchup was new, the next day I couldn’t taste or smell anything, I’d open a jar of minced garlic, put it up to my nose and nothing. It was fucking weird. I had a constant fever of 104.5 and eventually it tapered off on the 5th day. I didn’t take any medications, other than ibuprofen. It wasn’t a big deal, certainly not enough to warrant an experimental, non-approved vaccine. I had pneumonia years ago and that was the only time I’ve felt like I was actually dying and needed medical help.</p>

        <p>You can keep denying the term covid, but you are doing yourself wrong. It is different and it's real as fuck, it's just being used as an excuse to fuck us all over. But you covid deniers are doing us wrong. I had it, and trust me, shit is different. Maybe it's a different version of the flu, I don't care. It's named covid-19, and if it's a variant of the flu or not doesn't matter. It's still covid-19 and it's still real. It's just not as deadly lethal or scary as they make out to be. </p>
<p>But cause of people like you we all get a bad name. Stop denying it.</p>

        <p>I had covid when it first came out. Felt like death for about a month and lost some muscle mass from not being able to move much. I still remember my girlfriend crying next to me in bed because she thought I was dying. </p>
<p>Still wasn't the worse thing I've went through, and definitely not getting an experimental drug injected into me, but I can see why people would freak out over it.</p>

        <p>I've felt the same years ago when I had a cold/flu that turned into bronchitis. People get sick like that all the time. It's nothing to freak out over. Unless you're old, then yes, it can be deadly, but so would falling down when you're very elderly.</p>

        <p>i had covid, never missed a day of work. this was way back before the sickness had a name. my taste buds are still messed up to an extent. lettuce tastes like metal and i cant eat it on anything (big macs and the such) at all and a salad can only be eaten if its DRENCHED in dressing. aside from that im fine, lasted about a week and was like the flu, but not as bad. other people at work had similar experiences. no long term side effects other than taste has changed. seems the only people that really need to worry about covid are the elderly. most doctors suggest 60 and above get the jab but if your healthy and under 60 there really isnt much reason for it. im glad you recovered and are doing well now.</p>

        <p>They don't take lives, the issue is once someone requires intubation their lungs are pretty much shot to shit. By the point we intubate their P/F is so bad that we are immediately proning these patients to preserve and recruit any remaining good lung tissue we can which means deep sedation that doesn't allow for passive vent or muscle resistance so these people waste away. These days the intubated COVID patients we work with almost always end up with tracheostomies because their lungs just cant handle being off the vent due to scarring. But they'd die the second you extubate.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what to tell you bro. We never stopped intubating. When someone's SpO2 is 75% on 100% FiO2 12/8 BIPAP, they're breathing 50 times a minute, haven't been able to eat in a week because of all of that, and their P/F ratio is in the toilet, they need intubation to live. Those people still exist. And some of them do improve once they have been because we can give nutrition and let the body actually rest.</p>

        <p>The early intubation stuff was because of the risk of airborne exposure. The issue is it takes MUCH more resources and staff to properly manage an intubated patient than a non intubated one. You're doing EVERYTHING for them. Every 2 hours at a minimum you're deep suctioning their lungs, oral care, monitoring I&amp;Os, monitoring heart rate, turning them to prevent bed sores, managing restraints so they don't self extubate, doing incontinence care, changing vent settings so they oxygenate, doing tube feeds, running anywhere from 3-20 different medications at all times. It's a ton, most ICUs are 2:1 patients to nurse. So obviously when you add more patients and have no support staff less is going to get done. The problem is these cheap ass NYC hospitals didn't give a fuck and refused help for too long.</p>

        <p>Yes the standard of care that came out of China was to intubate moderate to severe covid patients. CPAP machines were said to spread covid to nurses so they weren't used.

        <p>I'm not sure what to tell you bud. Nevermind that I'm ON YOUR SIDE when it comes to vaccine choice, lockdowns, masking, and everything that matters.</p>
<p>But I don't make the decision to intubate, the doctor does, after discussing the situation with the patient and/or family and after the patient can no longer support a level of oxygen comparable with life. We don't unilaterally decide "y'know, I feel like tubing Mr. Johnson today.". I've talked to plenty of family members and tried to tell them that doing CPR on 70 lb, 92 year old grandma isn't going to do anything for her and that she should be a DNR. I've consulted ethics docs plenty of times when care has been futile. Ive seen intubated Covid patients make great recoveries and I've seen plenty of bad outcomes too. I keep my patients safe, as comfortable as I can with the orders available from the doctors, and I honor the wishes of patients and their families, while informing them of the realities of the situation as best I can.</p>
<p>If that makes me a sadist, then so be it.</p>

        <p>The early incorrect info from China was to avoid CPAP and BiPAP because of the increased risk of exposure. The virus is airborne, but it is airborne in microscopic droplet particulate much smaller than what the CDC considers "Droplet Precautions." Which is what makes cloth masks bullshit, because those will pass straight through one.</p>

        <p>I'm certain I had it back in November 2019 before it was even a thing in Kansas. I was sick, but not anything dayquil and ibuprofen didn't handle. I didn't even miss work. My husband and two of my three teenage kids felt the same. All standard flu-like symptoms, but maybe a little more elevated. Flashforward to a year later (Nov 2020), my oldest teenage kid gets pretty sick (lethargic, mopey, etc), but felt generally okay. We never got him tested because, why. If he had this super contagious virus, the rest of us would have gotten it. Especially considering that natural immunity supposedly expires after a 'short' time.   </p>
<p>I have a friend that got it after being a religious mask wearer, social distancing, working from home voluntarily, etc. Aside from her pics with bad lighting on social media to make it look worse than it was, she was fine. She had to do that virtue signaling thing to get sympathy and shit from other morons.</p>

<p>I remember when Louis Gossett Jr (actor) got it and went to the hospital, he said he felt uncomfortable, it smelled like death and nothing felt right about it.</p>
<p>He hauled ass and went home,even with the hospital staff begging him to stay and be admitted.</p>

        <p>If as many people had died from Covid over and above the normal mortality rate, don’t you think we would have run out of body bags and caskets? Serious question. I don’t feel I can trust any stats I find online. The woman from John Hopkins that suggested that death rates appeared to be flat over previous years was censored.</p>

        <p>fact of the matter is, most emergency mobile hospitals set up by the military went unused completely and the hospital ships saw like 2 patients. the ventilators were killing more people than covid was too. once they stopped using them the death rate dropped dramatically. the huge death numbers were caused by mismanagement of the liberal left...namely cuomo stuffing sick people into nursing homes where the most likely to die were the elderly....</p>

        <p>I don't think that in Canada, many extra people were stuffed into nursing homes, but the disgusting conditions that helped spur on tons of deaths in Ontario and Quebec were, for a lack of a better word, disgusting. Francois Legault at least said he took responsibility for it, while Doug Ford tried to blame anyone else besides himself or his colleagues.</p>

<p>... and then some dude caught him out with his family in public, while he was supposedly in his basement quarantine.   </p>

        <p>&rt;Thousands, millions of images of hospitals filled with people sick from "the virus" and not fucking ONE person was interviewed that HAD the illness?!</p>
<p>Well, yeah. I'll tell you nobody in my Medical ICU <em>could</em> be interviewed at one point because they were all on max pressure and O2 BiPAP or intubated. </p>
<p>It was real. All these people did die. But they died because of their comorbidities and our poor ways of managing the disease when it first came around. Intubation is tricky. Some need it early because not doing so is going to make them breathe so fast and hard for so long that they'll have to reserves left to recover with. Some we can give a good chance to and let them remain on BiPAP/CPAP for a week to see if they improve.</p>

        <p>What I'm reading here in some of these comments is that they had covid (Or thought so anyway) and it was like nothing they ever had. I believe that the hype that was built up coupled with actually getting symptoms made people think it was a lot worse than it was. I can't say whether I actually got covid or not (I would never get tested) or the flu and it was certainly something that made me fatigued and achy (For about a week) but I definitely don't think it was worse than some other years that I had the flu. Not saying people are lying but anxiety can make you believe a lot of things even if they are not true.</p>

        <p>It was a change in the classification of deaths issued by the W.H.O early in the pandemic. </p>

</ul>
<p>The CDC in early 2020 also changed "covid death classificaitons":</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Every country that had subscribed to W.H.O along the time (almost all countries in the world) were pressured to classify the deaths under the newly modified "death classification" codes.</p>
<p>This is a global network of criminals disguised under UN, WHO, WEF, etc, etc. - All being organized by another network of criminals, this time hidden - the various secret societies and wealthy (unknown) families around the word.</p>

        <p>Another thought. This is supposedly the greatest threat to every nation everywhere. Notice how the health and private sectors are all over the news. Other than the occasional visual of neighborhood vaccine drives you won't see military anywhere near this.</p>
<p>Greatest domestic national threat ever. No military.</p>
<p>It's almost like they are deliberately avoiding involving the military. Reckon it would prompt people to draw some very uncomfortable parallels between now and other certain times in history.</p>

        <p>That is actually a great point... how is everyone believing this nonsense. We have seen tons of influencers and celebrities who claim they were 'really sick' or even stayed in the hospital, but no one who was sick at the time. It certainly is interesting. I don't know a single person who was hospitalized with COVID, but I know people who have been hospitalized or continue to suffer from vaccine side effects.</p>

        <p>To be fair, they have an excuse why not. </p>
<p>It would be a HIPPA violation on the hospitals part so you would need patient consent. </p>
<p>The other part is getting someone to film it being family. And family being banned from the hospital during the peak of covid, well, also makes it impossible to see from the inside. </p>
<p>So we just rely on this reporting of suffering and death. No visual first hand footage or experience ourselves. </p>
<p>Very odd. But man they cover their butt real good. They have plausible deniability and we can’t prove them wrong. They can’t prove their right. So until we have proof, we are out of the money unfortunately</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what to tell you, there's tons of footage and reporting from inside COVID ICUs, even that whistleblower nurse that got fired in NYC for violating HIPPA and filming inside her ward. </p>
<p>As I've posted here before. I'm an ICU nurse. Covid is real, it killed a ton of people, but to a T everyone that has died here has had 4+ comorbidities and/or been obese. And most of them were out partying/drinking constantly during the height of the numbers when  it would have actually made sense to stay in for a while. (or just, not gone out at all with a BMI of 40% and having COPD, heart failure, diabetes, etc. ) The media and government mandated everyone shut down for a year to protect these fatties that wouldn't do basic shit to care for themselves.</p>

        <p>I agree with you, it has been terribly over reported. Car accidents ruled as covid deaths, etc. whole heartedly agree the comorbidites are at fault and covid is the last straw that broke the camels back. Keep in mind, it is also a money incentive for example getting remebursments for covid patients I hear. </p>
<p>Sick pharma and medical bussiness ruining the truth of medicine and health. </p>

        <p>It just gets old to hear people say "iT wAs A hOax" and blow the whole thing off. It fucked with me badly. I saw 2-3 people a day die for 3 months straight. That shit stays with you. I don't believe in hyperbole. I'm only now starting to come to terms with these people being forced to die alone because of our dogshit evil healthcare system. </p>
<p>Then to come home and see one community online calling me a twerking, lying, Tiktok whore and that it's all made up, and the media screeching about how anyone not wearing a face diaper is a Nazi, it just got me depressed. There is no room for nuance anymore. </p>
<p>My basic beliefs on this are as such:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you're fat or have comorbidities, be terrified of COVID, because even if your chances of getting it are low, it will kill you slowly and insidiously. You will be in the hospital and then rehab for months BEST CASE. Worst case we fail to oxygenate you and you're a vegetable with a hole in your neck to breathe for the rest of your life. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vit D and exercise. I'm not sure on hydroxycholroquine or ivermectrin. Every study on it working is in pre-hospitalized patients, and when given to intubated patients it is too late. Just take care of yourself. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccine should be your choice. I got mine and was sicker than shit when I got number 2. But working in healthcare and caring for 2 vulnerable adults I think it was worth it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccine side effects: best way to prevent them is what I said in number 2. Remain active and healthy.</p>
</li>

        <p>Covid is real and it's different. I got it in March 2020 while living in one of the epicenters (Elmhurst, NYC). It was unlike any cold or flu I'd ever had in that there was a heavy chest sensation, it was harder to breath, I got out of breath or fatigued easily doing what were previously un-debilitating tasks such as lugging groceries or shoveling soil or sorting through crammed racks of clothes. Coughing was light but persistent. It felt like my body was having more trouble getting oxygen. But I was never so unwell that I had to be bedridden or anything.   </p>
<p>Ultimately, I think it's a dangerous disease for the immuno-compromised and very old/unhealthy people out there, but that is a minority. We should have let those people stay in/work from home/get stuff delivered/get the vaccine, etc. while the real virus more or less harmlessly burned through the population at large, becoming an even more benign version of itself.</p>
