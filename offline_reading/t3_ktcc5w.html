    <strong>The common-sense way to reduce your risk of infection, that no one seems to want to mention...</strong>
    <p><p>...is to build up your immunity by making good lifestyle choices. Eat healthy, exercise, spend time outdoors, don't drink, don't smoke.</p>
<p>I'm looking at the CDC's webpage "How to Protect Yourself". It says what we all hear day in and day out now: wear your mask, maintain 6 feet, wash your hands. Nowhere does it mention making better lifestyle choices. Is it considered taboo now to encourage people to eat healthy and exercise? Improving immunity should be #1 priority, and all these things about masks, hand-washing, etc., should be secondary. Because mask, hand-washing, etc., are simply means to reduce exposure. It is going to become increasingly difficult to evade exposure unless you plan to never ever leave your house.</p>
<p>On the topic of never leaving your house, the most alarming aspect of all this to me is the "stay home, stay safe" campaign. I've realized that people are taking this quite literally. Yesterday I saw someone in my (fairly low-density) neighborhood walking with a mask on. Not the first time I've seen this, but this time something dawned on me. If this person believes they are going to catch a virus or infect others while walking alone outside with nobody else in the vicinity, it must have taken their utmost courage to even leave their house. It follows that there are probably people too scared to ever leave their houses at all, even for a walk around the neighborhood. </p>
<p>I find this thought disturbing, because this is the exact opposite of what people need in order to defend themselves from infection. Today was a beautiful winter day in my neck of the woods: 40's with brilliant sunshine. Days like this only come around a couple times per winter. Yet as I was riding my bike home from work, a 3-mile commute that is 90% through residential neighborhoods, I came upon only a couple of people out walking and enjoying the sunshine.</p>
<p>I believe the recent rise of home deliveries and "curbside pickup" is also adversely affecting people. Whether you want to believe it or not, the reality is that walking around at the grocery store and walking to and from a vehicle is the only exercise that some people ever get. Many years ago, before you could order everything online, I had a professor in college who was not at a healthy weight and always appeared sickly. One day she decided to tell the whole class that she drove to Walmart but was unable to make it from her car to the store on account of her bad knees. I'll never know her motive for divulging that, but the gravity of that story is something that's stuck in my mind for years and years. </p>
<p>I believe people need to be taught not to feel helpless. If you have a preventable health problem, why not take steps to fix it? Likewise, why not take steps to improve your immunity so you don't get a virus? I've always felt that it is a social responsibility to maintain your best health, but the onset of the virus has made me feel even more strongly about that. Not maintaining a healthy weight, smoking, and drinking to excess are all behaviors that cause burdens on society.</p>
<p>Sometimes on the news they'll memorialize a person who died from the virus who was in "perfect health". How do we know? Health records are confidential. The individual could have had any number of pre-existing conditions, some preventable, some maybe not, and, most importantly, some they may not even have known about (e.g., HIV). It's like they want us to feel helpless, as though they're saying "this person in perfect health died, and you could be next." I'd not be surprised if many people who watch these news features believe they are powerless against the virus, and that striving to be healthier will do nothing for them.</p>
<p>I just read a news article from USA Today describing how bad the virus is and how many are dying. But then they go on to say that there was also an unexpected increase in deaths from heart disease, diabetes, circulatory diseases, and dementia. Unexpected? We're told not to leave our houses. Each of these deadly ailments is related to a sedentary and/or isolated lifestyle. How is this at all unexpected? I consider it likely that some people who know they need to be healthier are using "stay home, stay safe" as an excuse to not exercise. It's unsafe outside, so I'll stay inside, and I can't really exercise inside, so I'll watch TV instead.</p>
<p>I'm a mind-my-own business type of person. But the reality is, when people refuse to leave their houses, we all suffer. It may be nice to not have to sit so close to other diners at the restaurant, but it won't be nice when the restaurant no longer exists. I'd like to know what can be done to change the instructions from "mask, 6 feet, and stay home" to "eat right, exercise, and go outside".</p></p>

        <p>The MSM might not mention it but there has been lots of mention to this (from myself and from others) on how fresh air, vitamin C, Vitamin D, sunlight and exercise is along with healthy eating is important  to make sure that your immune system is top notch. I always say this but if this was about health, this would be shared with the majority of people but this isn't about health...</p>

        <p>Yes, I think it's definitely quite possible that overusing hand sanitizer can lead to decreased ability to fight infections. Also most hand sanitizers are incredibly strong-smelling, some to the point of irritating my nose. I don't use them and rarely get sick. Not sure if there's a correlation.</p>

        <p>"I believe the recent rise of home deliveries and "curbside pickup" is also adversely affecting people."  </p>
<p>I've been saying this since curbside pickup started. People are becoming lazier and I've noticed a more childish entitled attitude from a lot of them.  Even customers that come in the store don't want to walk anywhere or touch anything. There are only 65 steps between my desk and the checkouts at my store, and the majority of customers whine about walking "all the way down there" when they realize I'm not a cashier, nor do I have a register to check them out at my desk. I hear the same response when they ask where an item or department is, they act like they are being forced to walk 20 miles uphill in the middle of a snowstorm.</p>
<p>Editing to clarify, that this is a desk I'm required to stand at when not getting orders for customers or loading up their car.</p>

        <p>That's crazy that people go into a big store and expect to not have to walk.</p>
<p>Also relevant to your comment is the fact that wearing a mask makes many people irritable, whether they admit it or not. I try to spend as little time as possible in stores because I don't want to spend my free time wearing a mask. It's bad enough to have to wear it all day at work.</p>

        <p>Because in recent years obesity is being normalized. Also the rise of food culture (bacon craze) has been glorifying eating like shit for the better part of a decade. People making terrible health choices under the guise of self love. Bottles of Purell in almost every public building you enter.</p>
<p>Take your vitamins, go for a walk, stop treating your body like a dumpster, and try to have a positive outlook on things. The virus attacks the weak, we can see why this won't end anytime soon, lots of weak people in the US.</p>

        <p>Yea dude. I've been banging my head against a table since March trying to figure that one out. Why indeed have they not talked about exercise and good diet. It's the new year now, and we've known since March that it adversely affects people with high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity the worst. Had there been a nationwide campaign to ask the american at a 30+ BMI to drop just 20 pounds, who knows how many lives that may have saved as of today.</p>
