    <strong>If you live on the west coast, there is no hope. Make plans to move if you can.</strong>
    <p><p>I can't take it here any longer, and have gotten so tired of it I feel like I'm about to explode lately any time I just hear the word COVID. </p>
<p>I'm an 18 year old living in California and I feel entirely hopeless about the future. I have not stepped foot on my HS campus since March 11th, 2020. Yes, our entire school year has been online. My mental health is easily the worst it has ever been and I haven't talked to a single person outside of my family since it all started.</p>
<p>If you go outside to walk on a trail, 85% of people will be wearing a mask. If you are walking up to an outdoor pick up spot for food takeout, others will stare at you like you are going to physically hurt them. </p>
<p>All CA Universities have announced that they are mandating the vaccine (I was called a nutjob for saying in the beginning of this all that this would happen.) Trust me, high schools/middle schools are going to mandate it next. Oregon is going to decide on a PERMANENT MASK MANDATE soon, and has entered a new shutdown. I'd expect Washington to consider the same since their Governor is also pretty crazy. </p>
<p>And last but not least... I go to the doctor for a check up last week. The doctor (as always) asks if I want to take the vaccine. I told her that I wasn't really interested at the moment and want to wait to see what happens before taking it. Her response? "Well, I think you should probably take it, you don't want to end up on a ventilator and the vaccine will allow you to do a lot of the things you used to enjoy before COVID." </p>
<p>That fact that I just heard a doctor 15 MONTHS into this say that an 18 year old will end up on a ventilator if they don't get the vaccine is the last straw for me with people here.  I am glad to be moving this summer and going to college in a open state that is not requiring the vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>West coast is a nightmare. These covid/vaccine/masks freaks, vegans, politically correct, ants and fish rights activists make your life a living hell. Gtfo and go enjoy life in a state where people live and enjoy life without constantly analyzing others</p>

        <p>It’s a damn shame because the weather and terrain is so nice there (coming from someone who has lived on the east coast all his life)!  </p>
<p>Also, avoid the east coast too.  It’s not as bad as your situation but most of the east coast outside of Florida is pretty depressing now too.</p>
<p>Edit:  Also, it’s really unprofessional to hear your doctor to say that, it seems that shes been binging on that good ole’ fear-porn.</p>

        <p>I feel you. In Spain is 99.9% the people who wear mask outside (it is mandatory and fines can go to 600€). Education has been online too (or hybrid). There is a region that wants to make taking the vaccine mandatory and all of them agree with vaccines passports. We’ve also been having shutdowns and curfews or lockdowns for more than a year now. The worst part is that most people are happy with this and blame people who don’t of every new stupid restriction politicians come up with.</p>
