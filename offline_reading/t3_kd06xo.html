    <strong>The Ultimate Anti-Lockdown Factsheet</strong>
    <p><p>CDC estimates 53 million Americans have had coronavirus (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html">www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html</a>).</p>
<p>The UK's Office of National Statistics says 8.7% of Britons have had the virus too (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19infectionsinthecommunityinengland/december2020">www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19infectionsinthecommunityinengland/december2020</a>).</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation says 10% of the world have been infected (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-54422023">www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-54422023</a>).</p>
<p>This means that, while the death rate of all tested and confirmed cases is between 1% and 3%, the actual death rate - based on true prevalence in the community - is far below 0.1%. The media using the confirmed case number rather than true prevalence gives the public a perception of danger ten times higher than the real danger, meaning they demand lockdowns that, in the context of past pandemics like swine flu '09 and Asian flu '62, are not proportionate to risk. "If it saves just one life," right? But it doesn't.</p>
<p>On the contrary, lockdowns kill tens of millions through starvation, disease, and poverty. This is according to institutions like the World Bank and UN: see “How coronavirus lockdowns in the US starve vulnerable abroad” (<a href="https://religionnews.com/2020/07/07/how-lockdowns-are-starving-the-most-vulnerable/">https://religionnews.com/2020/07/07/how-lockdowns-are-starving-the-most-vulnerable/</a>); “COVID-19 to Add as Many as 150 Million Extreme Poor by 2021 (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/10/07/covid-19-to-add-as-many-as-150-million-extreme-poor-by-2021">https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/10/07/covid-19-to-add-as-many-as-150-million-extreme-poor-by-2021</a>);” and “Millions predicted to develop tuberculosis as result of Covid-19 lockdown” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/06/millions-develop-tuberculosis-tb-covid-19-lockdown">https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/06/millions-develop-tuberculosis-tb-covid-19-lockdown</a>).</p>
<p>Because lockdowns have such an extreme human cost - comparable to a world war - <strong><em>we must</em></strong> end them if they are unwarranted. But tech billionaires have made more than a trillion dollars out of lockdowns and don't want them to end (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2020/11/27/us-billionaires-added-1-trillion-to-their-collective-wealth-since-the-start-of-the-pandemic-infographic/?sh=100c39be66ce">https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2020/11/27/us-billionaires-added-1-trillion-to-their-collective-wealth-since-the-start-of-the-pandemic-infographic/?sh=100c39be66ce</a>). They have means and motive to withhold access to information on platforms they own, but this is public health authority data and their continued ability to profit from human misery depends on your silence.</p></p>

        <p>Our community uses total tests vs total positive readings to come up with percentages that force us back into lockdown. It makes zero sense to me. What about the thousands who didn't even get tested?</p>

        <p>They were even saying that if someone in your house has it, just assume you do to and take the same quarantine measures as they do.</p>

        <p>Oh they definitely do that here. Because AsyMpToMaTiC. Either take a test or automatically quarantine for ten days. Bizarro world. I'm so over this shit.</p>
