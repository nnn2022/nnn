    <strong>Tactics of power hungry used to push an agenda</strong>
    <p><h1>Miss label a group</h1>
<p>In a large group of people you will find people of various beliefs and kinds. The larger the group the easier it is to find someone to entice and have them say what seems to be dumb on the surface. Once done this one person now is given the spotlight and the masses are told everyone is like this in this group. Most people do not think further and now the group is labeled.</p>
<p>Modern day all free thinkers and people that question the fabric of our society are labeled as conspiracy theorists. This is censorship of our thoughts. By using this clever label people see it being derogatory to question against the narratives and automatically censoring their thoughts of ideas without even realizing it.</p>
<h1>New step is compared to what we currently have</h1>
<p>The existing precedent is used to compare the new step. We already have mandatory vaccines at school is used to compare that the new vaccine isn't much different. Or how you upload photos to iCloud already it's easier to accept the next step of doing processing on the photos. This is a technique that repeats and with each step freedoms are chipped away.</p>
<h1>All good causes are a trojan horses</h1>
<p>In the past decade all deterioration of our freedoms have been wrapped in a good cause you can't argue against. It's always of some form "think of the community", "save lives", "better security". Hidden underneath these good causes are rules and regulations that go beyond what is necessary and sets new precedents. The new precedent will be used to make the new step easier to accept. The short term is emphasized, while the long term freedoms being chipped away are suppressed. And for most people thinking long term is harder.</p>
<p>The broader issue is that everything is sugar coated to look good and distract you from looking inside. Sometimes laws are written in good faith with corruption slipped in so no one will notice. Corruption tends to hide behind complexity, the good cause for complexity is usually to handle everyone and all cases, and discouraging you from thinking of simpler solutions by saying that something simple has not been thought out very well. A great example of this is inflation, it doesn't take a genious to see inflation rises the price of everything around them faster than their wages. And when you ask where does this new money come go to? the corruption in the complexity of inflation shines through.</p>
<h1>Censorship</h1>
<p>This is an obvious one. We see it everywhere now even on reddit. With the help of the above it becomes increasingly easier to censor content. I'm sad to say that many people don't notice the censorship when I talk to people in real life. Censorship is also what the news doesn't tell you. It's used in conjunction with miss-labeling a group by not reporting more educated individuals, or even celebrities. Canada is starting to do some china level censorship. For example voices of NFL that go against the narrative of to vaccinate everyone are suppressed in the canadian media, and instead they interview people no one knows.</p>
<p>The good cause for censorship is miss-information today. Whether it is miss-information or not censorship is censorship and we are going further down the line for more censorship as a society.</p>
<h1>Report "everything"</h1>
<p>This goes in line with censorship, where everything is reported so no one can say there is censorship. But what is censored is not on the front page and hard to find. This makes people that say there is censorship in a developed country look like conspiracy theorists, cause someone can say "look it's reported here" only after the fact a question is raised. But before then no one new. For example I'm sure NFL voices against vaccinations are reported somewhere on CBC, but they aren't going to put that on TV, front page, or anywhere easy to find. It is out of sight for the general population.</p>
<p>As censorship increases the report everything will be done less.</p>
<h1>Dictatorship is faster than democracy</h1>
<p>Yes democracy isn't perfect. This is a cruel one and we already see it happening in USA. But it's not compared to dictatorship, it's compared to having an agency whip out rules without any checks and balances. This is the definition of dictatorship. The previous president did this with executive orders, the current one is doing this too, and even tried a step further with CDC making laws outside it's authority regarding evictions. All this is done with a good cause, which sets a new precedent, anyone against is labeled as "you don't care about suffering people so you are against these new rules".</p>
<p>This is exactly how Xi (aka winnie the pooh, aka president of china) came to power. He promised that by him continuing rule the country can move faster, and used this to chip away at freedoms. If you talk to chinese you would know that all the techniques in this article has been employed. All rules was done for good causes that steal freedoms &amp; power. China has been a guinea pig and now all governments around the world are using similar techniques.</p>
<h1>Data is analyzed and used against us</h1>
<p>All the studies &amp; focus groups to get peoples opinions make people feel like the government, corporation, or whatever entity is doing them cares about you. The actual purpose is to know how much backlash will their be in their evil plan and how far they can go with a new step forward deteriorating your freedom. All the acceptance surveys shows is that if majority accept it's easier to go with the particular plan. The wording, the framing, is all A/B tested to see what is the best way to push an agenda without the masses getting too smart. How can an agenda be phrased so that standing up against it can be ridiculed? Usually wrapping it in a good cause.</p>
<h1>It's always an emergency</h1>
<p>It's easier to not do checks &amp; balances when in an emergency to move faster. This has started in corporations with crunch time. Some companies it's always crunch time, we have been normalized to it already, and now the always being an emergency is moving into the government level.</p>
<h1>The fight against all the above</h1>
<p>The only way to fight against it is to recognize these techniques. Educate each other, and educate people outside of these communities. We will be insulted, we will be downvoted. Bombarding everything all at once at someone isn't going to work, but bit by bit, over time just like in school, learn in steps the techniques used, how to think, how to ask questions, and what questions to ask. We also need to move forward in making it acceptable and not taboo to question the fabric of our society. I don't understand how it became taboo, or if it always was. It is a scary thought that people take in what the see in the news, labels given and accept it as is without further thoughts.</p>
<p>I was once a sheep, I did not intend to seek truth. The pandemic made the truth glow bright so I could open my eyes and see the lies, all broken fragments that don't even fit together. I did not know how to think, it's not something school teaches us. Thinking critically is something we will need to teach each other as a community. The vaccine we really need is to be immunized to the manipulation by corporations, media, and government in our everyday lives.</p></p>
