    <strong>Hello other normal people, it's been a while since I've posted here but let me frame this random hypothetical situation that doesn't have anything to do with anything really that I just thought of the other day.</strong>
    <p><p>Let's just assume that randomly you and everyone else in the world had always been farting in and out nonstop and forever, and I'm not talking small dry squeakers; I'm talking wet, juicy, human-lung sized farts. In and out and alternating every 1-5 seconds. Now let's say this guy Joey walks into a store with a clean n95 mask strapped to his ass. Well n95's filter <em>approximately</em> 95% of the particles, let's also say Joey's friend Danny runs in bare assed for 5 minutes because he's a quick shopper, but Joey likes to browse and take his time so he ends up spending 100 minutes in the store. Now theoretically, because Joey is such a slow shopper, even with his fancy medical grade n95 mask, and because he is spending so long in the store, Joey is releasing just as much killer stank ass into the store as Danny. Now just to continue let's say someone makes it a law so bear-assing is now illegal inside of stores because people think it's gross even though for all of human history, the majority of the people across the globe had been bare ass farting in and out forever into stores, and they had tried underpants before during many points in human history but it never fixed the smell. Danny begins wearing some thin cotton underpants and decides to stop bare assing because he doesn't want to get in trouble, and here's the thing about Danny, Danny's been wet farting in and out on these underpants for weeks without changing them. Danny hates the underpants, to avoid conflict and fines he angrily puts on his wet, dirty, juicy underpants, he knows his ass is now soaked with warm fart juice, and he would prefer to just fart bare assed because his ass cheeks chafe and the moisture and heat feel uncomfortable. He also knows that every store still smells like ass because he can fucking smell everyone's perpetual farts leaking in and out nonstop forever. He tries to argue the point that the store smells like ass and it's obvious, but he is dismissed as racist and retarded. The people continue to fart in their wet pants in spite of Danny, the stores continue to reek, and Danny grows angrier and angrier that his shopping experience has become so stinky and uncomfortable. Joey doesn't mind the chafing of his ass and actually enjoys the feeling of walking around with his ass covered in fart juice. Joey is also a very slow shopper who loves walking around farting in and out inside buildings while he frantically looks to find the last stock of toilet paper so he can finally wipe his ass.</p>
<p>Anyways I don't know what this has to do with anything but I hope you've all been doing well and keeping your mental health in check. With love, RateDapists.</p></p>
