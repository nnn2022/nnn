        <p>For city folks, it isn't that far fetched. Most already don't own much. rent an apartment, if they 'own' a car, they're still paying it off &amp; then trade it in. Or they rent the car, either long term lease or as needed. I can, right now, rent a fully furnished &amp; stocked apartment, just bring my clothes &amp; toiletries. (Like when I was in the Army) </p>
<p>Is it the future? Who knows? But for a lot of people, things wouldn't change much.</p>

        <p>Cars:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Everything becomes electric and self-driving / autopilot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They'll stop selling gasoline in a couple of years, so that all older cars people own become useless</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Houses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most people are in debt, this debt will be forgiven</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mortgages will be paid by 'the government'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People don't have to pay rent anymore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This can be done when 'the government' owns the real estate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A couple of rich people will continue to own their own property, but the majority gets to 'live' 'free' in government owned houses</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Entertainment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Netflix, Spotify, etc. becomes the standard, DVDs and CDs become a thing of the past, but of course what you have right now can still be owned by you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of these accounts are connected to your social credit score; enough credit means access to entertainment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Food &amp; Drinks</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Available with social credit score</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synthetic meat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water is owned by the rich powers that be</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Travel</p>
<ul>
<li>Only for the rich and privileged</li>
</ul>
<p>How are they going to make this possible? People have so much property right now...</p>
<p>The economy must crash; they're doing their best to make that happen. Businesses are closed, which means a lot of people lose money.</p>
<p>After a while the government 'comes to the rescue' and provides 'the solution': all debt will be forgiven... in exchange for the government taking over all of the property. (Also in combination with UBI.)</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/lgzl1w/its_all_about_the_vaccination_passport/">vaccination 'passports' are tied with the social credit system</a> and this becomes a 'normal', mainstream thing. Everybody has a digital ID that is connected with the cloud. (Hence 5G.)</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>This is their plan, but it definitely isn't a fact that they're going to achieve this.</p>

        <p>This is an easy one...global currency reset. They have been trying to take the world off the American dollar for decades. Remember when they tried to replace it with the euro? What they will do if tank the world economic by tanking the dollar and then the banks will clean up.</p>

        <p>I duno most people have a mortgage or debt of some description. Debt jubilee but you give up your assets. They don't have to get every one to agree to just enough that it'll snowball. Eventually you'll be some sort of right wing conspiracy theorist for not wanting to give up your assets.</p>

        <p>The subscription based pricing model is much easier to predict, for those who siphon our resources. If they can get us to prefer ACCESS to property over OWNERSHIP, they could potentially leech off of us forever and we would never be “free”. </p>
<p>It’s scary, but if they** provide enough incentive for us to give up our property we probably will, just as we accepted renting access to streaming many different things as preferable to ownership of a limited tangible product. </p>
<p>It’s possible we might accept renting access to shelter and security as preferable to ownership. If we had access to a network of thousands of lodgings at any given time, but we had to give up our right to ownership, might many of us take that choice? </p>
<p>Here’s the kicker, how many of us would take a similar deal of access over exclusivity with our significant other? (Don’t answer that)</p>
<p>It only takes a couple of generations to shift the value system of the population, and it’s getting quicker. What we believe will not be what our grandchildren believe, and it may not be a positive change.  </p>
<p>**You know it’s kind of fucked up now that I think about it, there isn’t really a “they”, it’s just a “we”. The human animal attempting to rise to the top of its environment by any means necessary, especially at the expense of or detriment to a competitor. Like, we would all probably try the same thing and be just as greedy and heartless if we were the ones on the other side of the coin. How many slaves would have sooner traded places with his master and cracked the whip on him than stand beside him as equal and see him as brother? At the end of the day, we’re a species with such a complex, continuously evolving social hierarchy and distribution of resources, we can’t solve shit unless we make it a win from all positions, master and servant. Fuck I’m high disregard this</p>
