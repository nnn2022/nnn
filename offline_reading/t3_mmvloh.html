    <strong>I am scared the masks alone will destroy my immune system</strong>
    <p><p>I wear the masks, I am high risk, and believe the virus is real. I don't bother anyone else about wearing them anymore since I woke up. However one thing I am worried about is my immune system weakening from the wearing of masks. I find myself doing things like not worrying if a cup is perfectly clean out of the dishwasher and other strange things joking, "Hey my immune system needs something to work on". Has anyone explored this topic. I wear KN95 outside. My life is devoid of humans except husband. I was in a thrift store for 10 minutes looking for a couch yesterday with a mask on. [barely anyone in there--I will only go in nearly empty stores and we really need the couch] Part of me thinks I am going to be screwed when I have actual colds or flus to run into in the future.</p></p>

        <p>Get fresh air and sunshine.  Take some extra vitamin D.   </p>
<p>Don't wear a mask unless you absolutely have to.   Pull it down a bit and breathe through your nose when you can.</p>
<p>You'll be fine.  Focus on being healthy mentally and the body will follow.</p>

        <p>Yeah I take off the masks as much as possible and do not wear them outside if I am a certain distance away from other people. With heat, breathing through them is harder. Thanks. I am on Vit D supplements so Okay there.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The masks do not protect against COVID-19 (I can post the authoritative Danish study to that effect here if you'd like) and you are probably right that they are bad for your health in other ways. The above poster is spot on.</p>

        <p>My husband is high risk and aside from work he doesn't wear the mask at all. I don't wear it period because I need to build immunities and breathe fresh air. None of has gotten sick or died. We take a vitamin D, C zinc and elderberry and stay healthy. The fear will make you crazier. It's not some airborne virus that will make you bleed out and die. Fear Ebola more than corona.</p>

        <p>Take a multivitamin and extra vitamin D. If you have to wear a mask change it out a lot. Clean it but key thing is.. let the sun hit it as much as possible. My parents won’t listen to me about masks or the shot but they at least agree to sun on the masks. Bacterial pneumonia is a bigger harsher disease than covid. By far.</p>

        <p>We wear KN95 we constantly change. Never more then 4 hours worth of wearing, I have to remind husband to change his, he put on a new one yesterday. It costs more money. I don't want pneumonia. Neither of us has a full time job, I would never make it with a mask that long, me disabled and he works at home. I agree about pneumonia happening from masks being dirty or on too long.</p>

        <p>That's a tough situation, but you have brought up a great point a lot of people skip over. If you sanitize everything none stop, and wear a mask almost 24/7 it can do way more harm than good, because you will lower your immune system which will then cause a greater risk of getting sick. You need to be exposed to germs to keep your immune system up and running strong. Thank you for acknowledging this. (I am not a doctor. This is a personal opinion) As for your situation I would recommend vitamins and other natural immune boosters. Perhaps a good tea with antioxidants. Like some others have said get out in the sun and enjoy some fresh air outside without a mask in a private location like your back yard if you have one. As I always say. You do what's best for you. You know your limits, and only you can decide what risks you can take. 
I wish you good health and good luck.</p>

        <p>In all honesty I think it's your fear of being close to people that is actually killing your immune system, aka "stress". Stress destroys your immune system. One of the ways you build immunity is contact with people believe it or not. Masks are just the cherry on top and of course the negatively effect you but I would bet my life savings your stress is killing you faster than anything else. Of course what do I know I'm just some dude. On the other hand the "experts" have been wrong this entire time.....</p>
