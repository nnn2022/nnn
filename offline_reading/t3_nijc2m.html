    <strong>“Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.”</strong>
    <p><p><em>There is no defense. It’s irrational. It’s infuriating. It also works as  a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.</em> </p>
<p>My girlfriend works at a Whole Food's type market in an uppity part of town.</p>
<p>So extremely uptight that they keep a surplus of masks up front, and disposable face shields if you can't wear a mask for medical reasons.</p>
<p>A new policy states that if 50% of the store's workers receive their vaccines, people that have been vaccinated (with proof) no longer have to wear their masks.</p>
<p>These fucks really need to use peer pressure to get people to take their vaccine. That's how you know this is all a charade. Oh, you also get a $100 gift card. </p>
<p><strong>"Inject an experimental substance into your blood stream or be publicly humiliated on a daily basis at your workplace."</strong></p>
<p>They've also removed their hazard pay policy. Gift cards. To the same store.</p>
<p>Which one is it? Is COVID so harmless that you need to remove hazard pay, or is it so dangerous that unvaccinated people need to continue to mask up?</p>
<p>Which fucking one is it?</p>
<p>What an absolute fucking clown world.</p></p>

        <p>I work at a Kroger, they’re doing the same thing. The $100 gift card to their store goes ONTO YOUR KROGER CARD ACCOUNT. Not that I’d ever get the vaccine, but let’s say I did and I still just wanted cash — gift cards can be resold. My Kroger card that also links my employee discount and personal information, not so much. It’s funny and sad all at the same time.</p>
