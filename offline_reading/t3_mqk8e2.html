    <strong>Isn’t it scary how many people defend the narrative?</strong>
    <p><p>Why do they defend their rights being taken away? While worshipping their gods the “experts”, corrupted politicians and fake news. </p>
<p>Can anyone tell me? Has human civilization reverted that much? Especially on this site. Has to be bots with generated upvotes. Right? Is the left this obedient to the system?</p></p>

        <p>I work with a lot of educated liberals. They believe in the greater good and they all trust figures of authority - especially NPR journalists. </p>
<p>They truly believe that what they are doing is morally right. They don't like being bad or getting in trouble. The media is on a moral crusade that chastises people who don't agree with them as being selfish and bad. </p>
<p>The people I work with are arrogant about their education. They don't like being wrong. It's too easy to agree with whatever journalists say. Instant proof that you're right - no thought required. </p>
<p>But, I really think the greater good is a large part of the answer. They will do anything for the greater good. This is what gives them meaning in life. It's basically their religion.</p>

        <p>What I don't get are these teenagers who are passionate defenders of the status quo in this regard.</p>
<p>First of all,  when I was in high school, pretty much nobody talked or cared about politics back in those days outside of civics class.  Most of my friends were closer to hippies than anything and critical towards government policies because back then the war on drugs was probably one of the bigger issues.</p>
<p>I understand why it's like this now, it's just weird.  I'm very curious about the mentality regardless.</p>

        <p>Sunk cost fallacy in terms of social/emotional investment.  </p>
<p>They foolishly projected themselves on social media for a year.  Now they have to keep up the charade to maintain their standing with friends and family.  They can't just quietly admit it's bullshit and stop supporting it.</p>

        <p>If there was an exponentially more severe word than scary....it would be that word. Not only are we going to have to go up against the government to get back the rights they have deemed they have some authority to take and give as they see fit , but we have to battle 80% of our fellow Americans who have relinquished their rights because they were told to, and believe we should too</p>
