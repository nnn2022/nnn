    <strong>I want to know other peoples thoughts on this opinion?</strong>
    <p><p>Do you think vaccine passport policies are propaganda to get people all stirred up and against one another and create the new boundaries and definitions of the Left/Right Culture wars? I started seeing today Rudy Giuliani's son is now running for governor of NY and espousing he will not take the vaccine.</p>
<p>I wouldn't trust that guy as far as I could throw him. I could see once he would get in office him selling everyone out and all vaccines will be mandated in the state of NY after he gets a payout from Pharma after a few years in office. Or is the overall Republican party now just taking up this platform simply for votes? I lean neither right nor left on traditional areas, so I'm curious how other people feel.</p>
<p>Here is my source to this new stance of "Reformed" Republicans:</p>

        <p>These passports are the trojan horse and introduction to global health pass initiatives and global identification laid out by the WEF. ID2020 and Good Health Pass. Contracts have already been signed with big tech companies, and if they don't get this shit rolled out there's going to be a lot of money lost.</p>
<p>That's also the reason behind the recent cyber attacks, which are only going to get worse. They want you to have an online digital identification that's used for everything from banking to social media. Again, another system of control so they can de-platform you if you don't go along with the narrative.</p>
<p>These control freaks in power want full spectrum dominance and control over your mind, spirit and body.</p>

        <p>The government is allowing businesses to discriminate. This is supposed to be illegal. At some point, it will justly be ruled so. There are at least 3 to 4 Amendments that Vax passports violate and they are all part of the original 10. This passport is going absolutely nowhere eventually.</p>
<p>If anything the propaganda about the passports is to scare fence-sitters into getting off the rail. Unfortunately, there are still a ton of these people.</p>

        <p>I think if not enough people push back, then they will do it.  If we push they'll say we're crazy and that was never something they considered.</p>
