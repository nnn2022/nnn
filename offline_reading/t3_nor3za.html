    <strong>Thanks, Old People!</strong>
    <p><p>We gave the vaccine to old people first because they are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. </p>
<p>Well, yes, but not for the altruistic reasons promoted. It wasn't to save grandma first because we love her. We gave the vaccine to old people first because they are the most vulnerable to COVID-19 *and* the vaccine. </p>
<p>Test it on the old folks. They're the most frail. They're systems are the weakest. If it doesn't kill them, then we'll test it on people with pre-existing conditions and the fat people. Which is what we did. Once it mostly worked on them, then it was released to the general population. But not the kids. The kids are the other weaker subset and we can't risk killing off the next generation. </p>
<p>Oh it all makes sense. </p>
<p>Not only are the old people the most vulnerable to both the virus and the vaccine, they're also the least productive to the economy and have the least chance of ever being productive again in the future. If they died en masse, hey, they were old. It could be explained away and it wouldn't hurt the economy. Just the opposite. A bunch of old folks dying off would ease the strain on the economy. It wouldn't hurt the growth potential of humanity because they're past breeding age. There was nothing to lose, except old people, by testing the vaccine on old people first. </p>
<p>Then we tested it on the sick and fat. Again, if they die, we can explain it. They were sick and fat. They're also a drain on the economy with all their sickness and fatness. No huge loss. Not like the loss of our most fit would be. </p>
<p>The most fit of us, the ones doing the most work, we got it second to last-- once it looked safe enough to not crash the economy (further) and take down humanity at the same time. Can't have all the workers and breeders die off. </p>
<p>So now it's just the kids. Physically, they are very resilient, but they don't have the immune system or developed bodies and minds as young adults. Right! See, that's why they're last. Uh-huh. How many vaccines does a kid get before kindergarten? Exactly. It would be foolish to kill off the kids. Like the song said, the children are the future. </p>
<p>The whole vaccine rollout is a hedge bet against killing ourselves off. A lizard risking its tail to save the rest of its body.</p></p>
