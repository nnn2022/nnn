    <strong>We have gained 609 people here over the last 26 hours. When did you arrive here and what brought you here?</strong>
    <p><p>I came here months ago at 38k. This is the fastest I've seen it growing here, it seems to be accelerating rapidly.  I am curious as to when you arrived here and what brought you here? Did you come here many months ago when it was harder to find people who agreed with your viewpoints? Are you here because you're just curious about what people here talk about and you disagree but you want to see what's going on here? Are you a new member and are you here because you're frustrated or you're experiencing yet another lockdown or restriction? Is the vaccine push concerning you and you came here to see what others think?</p>
<p>Please be respectful even if you disagree.</p></p>

        <p>I am in New York City and I have felt extremely isolated and alone for many many months.  I was searching DuckDuckGo for something and something here popped up and I clicked on it and that's how I found this board. It has been a Lifeline for me.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately DuckDuckGo seems to be controlled opposition. They've censored the Bill Gates x Japanese broadcaster interview, the one where he says "different pokes for different folks". On the topic of election integrity, they fast-track shitty fact checkers like "USA Today" to the top.</p>
<p>So use DDG with a grain of salt. It's that ducking logo that bothers me the most, it's a red herring.</p>

        <p>I have heard people mention this, someone mentioned start page but I didn't like it. I watch a content creator on bitchute and he mentioned Yandex which is the Russian Google and I tried that and it was interesting. Not really sure what to use at this point so I try different engines to see what I get. The difference in results is kind of shocking sometimes</p>

        <p>I use Yandex, it's alright. I don't use it for search though since I don't understand Russian. There are a few search engines that I found. One is Metager.

        <p>I was shocked how much it cost to stay at the Dollywood dreammore spa hotel but I said what the hell I'm going for it I'm pretty sure I will never go back there again and I might as well do it up! I've lived through hell over the last year-and-a-half in New York City and I deserve this. I thought about staying in a cheap place but in the end this is something that I have wanted to do for many years and with what's going on in the world right now who knows what the future will bring! I will definitely check out lightning rod! I can't wait to go to the dinner show, I think they call it the Stampede it looks like so much fun!</p>

        <p>I was born in bklyn but I grew up in Johnstown of all places! I've gone up to that area three times over the last year and I was never happier in my life to be there. I love it. I stayed at Amsterdam Castle which is a fabulous place despite the bad rep Amsterdam has. It was heaven. I spent a lot of my childhood on the Sacandaga and in the adirondacks and it's my happy place. I did notice that when I was in Schenectady it started to feel a little more obnoxious. It seems that if you are in any City, even a small one that's where the worst people congregate. Total groupthink. I think about moving back there all the time but the one thing that stops me is this entire state is basically at the mercy of the idiots here in New York City and what they vote for. I wish they could weigh voting, it's just not fair that this city full of idiots makes decisions for people in the rest of the state. New York state is beautiful it has everything, Lakes, the ocean, mountains Etc. I love it and I never ever thought I would even think of moving but I don't know how much longer I can go on like this!</p>

        <p>Yea upstate is greatly underated tourist wise, the Adirondacks offer everything and more that the Smokey Mountains do without all the tourists. Such a shame we are connected to that awful city, the upstaters are nothing like the people from the city in fact the people from the city are just like the people from New Jersey</p>

        <p>Exactly! I joined the super straight Reddit which was basically satire and I couldn't believe how nice people were. It was only up for a few days and it was just done as a joke and people were so accepting and kind. But again it got banned as a hate Reddit. At this point whenever someone tells me not to go somewhere I think to myself this is definitely got to be the place to go LOL and it usually is! Total Streisand effect</p>

        <p>I joined around the 77K members mark. I  had no one to talk to about the vaccine and media lies. My family disagrees and most of them are vaccinated. Searching reddit at first proved fruitless...saw all the subreddits calling us anti vaxxers and all sort of vile names. Then I found this subreddit. Though irl I’m still alone in my unvaccinated bubble, it’s helpful to come on here and see this subreddit growing. I’m still fearful for what’s to come, but I’m glad at least I’m not alone with my views on what’s happening. Thanks everyone for being here....truly.</p>

        <p>Joined a few months ago. Noticed this sub is a mixed bag of people. I like how we can have honest conversations about what's happening. </p>
<p>Every other sub feels like people are literally brainwashed and repeating the same things the MSM does. No critical thinking. </p>
<p>I also find comfort in people expressing their anxieties about lockdowns, vax mandates and nonsensical covid rules that have impacted their lives. The finger pointing is at the establishment versus at other people. I find other subs point to us skeptics as if we are the reason for the entire pandemic.</p>

        <p>Been here since before we hit the 10k mark last July I think it was. While general discourse has done nothing but deteriorate on the rest of reddit, ours has only grown more resolute and it’s a beautiful thing to see and read. </p>
<p>Without this sub I don’t think I would have gone through the self realization of allowing myself to trust my instincts. Being part of the up and coming, freshly graduated generation who haven’t been taught an ounce of critical thinking, the past 18 months has been terribly isolating for me amongst my peers and ashamedly I find myself keeping my trap shut more than I say what I feel. And I’m known as the guy without the filter in my group. </p>
<p>It’s been a rollercoaster of suicidal notions, adapting to survive and accepting that it’s just me that wakes up with existential dread over what’s obviously being inflicted upon us. I’ve been talked down by a good friend for “conspiracy speak”. </p>
<p>Not only the existential dread, but starting everyday knowing that I’m now returned to the fight or flight mode of my abuse ridden past with authoritarian overreach. I never thought I’d experience this feeling ever again, especially in a loving home where I feel safe. </p>
<p>Despite all of this, I’m so grateful to be a part of this community. Without a doubt the most empathetic people I’ve conversed with. Your rationale and sanity is a lifeline for me. This is the real fight and it was declared against us March 2020. We’re in the thick of it but you all give me strength. Godspeed fellow truthers❤️</p>

        <p>Wow what an interesting post here thank you for making it! I have often wondered about younger people, I'm middle-aged and things were so different when I was coming up. I was taught to always have numerous sources and look at each one and make your decisions through doing your own investigation. I know younger people aren't being taught how to think anymore, it seems like they're just being taught what to think and how to accept certain narratives. This actually scares me. I think we have an entire generation that has been primed to be obedient Serfs. It's amazing that you have not Fallen to that. The stigma of being called a conspiracy theorist has gotten to an extremely annoying point now. Whenever anyone is called that I think to myself I bet this person has some really interesting things to say I should check it out LOL</p>

        <p>Ironically what brought me here is how often the rest of Reddit calls this a far right sub even on major subreddits and calls for it to be banned regularly. I didn't see how it was that extreme, which made me check it out more. I found everyone here is just sick to death of the bullshit and lies around covid, and need a place to vent without being silenced or censored, a place to spread ideas and try and come up with an idea about what's going on in our world. Almost like every other subreddit. And yet they talk about this place like it's an active neo-nazi recruitment center. Very scary stuff.</p>

        <p>I had the same experience over the last couple of years actually. Whenever I see something talked about as a far right extremist content a lot of the time it's just common sense talk. And I am a former Democrat for many years at this point this is not a partisan issue. But they keep turning it into that to divide people. Last week fauci was telling people to get over their political biases and take the vaccine. I can't believe people honestly think political beliefs are what's stopping us from taking this. They want so badly to believe that they are losing their Common Sense here. I have had people say oh your precious Trump is the one who's responsible for the vaccine! And I'm like he's not my precious Trump I'm not a trump supporter but if it makes you feel better to say that then keep doing it you make no sense LOL</p>

The place is filled with people who went along with this shit from the beginning and is also being flooded with the "If the government mandates it I'm gonna get it" crowd which shouldn't be here because they're cowards and would rat any of us out to save their job not realizing they WILL suffer the same fate.

        <p>I’m not sure when I joined. Perhaps 3 months ago? I check this sub daily and it’s really helping me feel less alone. Digging into the data, it’s clear to me something is amiss and, as a student of history, I know it’s not “tin foil hat” to believe or suspect, or at least not cast aside, the idea thats there’s something much deeper and more nefarious here.</p>

        <p>Agree, especially on the real people part. I honestly feel like the internet is filled with Bots or whatever you want to refer to them as, shills Maybe? It's not reality in a lot of places. There's no way real people are thinking that way. And it's be done to make us feel like we are alone in our thoughts but we are not.</p>

        <p>I disagree but that's okay. There's a lot of content, some of it is questionable but some of it is spot-on. I also appreciate the vibe here and the acceptance. You're not going to get through to anyone calling them a moron or an idiot and I see this everywhere else. I actually feel the same about other places that are supporting lockdowns and the entire narrative. People are very emotionally-charged over this and it's clouding their judgment. I'm sure this goes both ways too</p>

        <p>been here for a good few months, i actually saw it on AHS where i tend to find the best subs. it was nice to see stuff other than the news trying to scare everyone. as my local area no one tends to care or ever cared no one would even talk about it.</p>
<p>recently tho the sub has started shifting into conspiracies and hating on anyone who is skepticle, we used to debate people now its just "go research it yourself!" or some broken/old/one off link that doesnt even say what they think it does.</p>

        <p>My first user name was here when we had about 3000 members.  I posted regularly.  I decided to break from Reddit for a month or around the election.  Since this is my only communication with the rest of the world (outside of work where I don’t discuss any of these matters), I came back.  Been gone from FB/Twitter since June 2020, but still here.</p>
<p>What brought me here was watching the pandemic, or whatever this is/was, turn into <em>something else</em>, last summer, during the social riots across America.  That’s when I KNEW, though I suspected before, this entire thing was about politics.</p>

        <p>I arrived a few months ago and i came here because, fuck the vaccine, fuck the lockdowns and travel restrictions, fuck pcr testing, fuck masks and fuck all the authoritarian governments. I'm also glad to see some people can actually still think critically and have healthy skepticism.</p>

        <p>Six months or so ago I joined this sub and I'm so happy I did. I'm tired of hear that lockdowns are good and vaccines will fix everything. Even though nothing has changed if anything it's gotten worse. Seeing the posts on here and listening to the people talk about what's going on has made me feel so much better. Thank you NoNewNormal.</p>

        <p>I really don't remember when.  I want to say it was in the middle of the farce lockdowns.  I think I found this through another sub.</p>
<p>Glad to be here, though.  Sometimes entertaining to see neophyte trolls attempt to rile people up with their weak copy pasta narrative texts.</p>
<p>Mostly it is good to see there are like minded people across the world. Oddly, generally civil in a world that has grown increasingly shrill.</p>

        <p>I've been here since day 1. Someone posted a message on lockdown skepticism saying something along the lines of "with the end of lockdowns, I thought we needed a place to discuss and push back against mask mandates, distancing and other things stemming from the "new normal" brought by the pandemic". Something like that. I tried to find the original post but it seems to have been deleted.</p>
<p>My feelings now are the same as then:</p>

<p>Ever since the winter lockdown happened, I've felt even more loneliness and despair than before. The autumn used to be my favorite time of the year. Now I'm absolutely dreading it, since the next lockdown and the return of the outdoor mask mandate (the indoor one never went away) are all but guaranteed.</p>

        <p>Wow I can totally relate to so much of what you're saying, the fear and the despair is so heavy! I'm so sorry you're going through this at such a young age, it has to be extremely difficult for you. All I can say is try to remember that there have been challenging times throughout history and people have always made it through and come out the other side. No one knows what's going to happen and where this will lead , I think we need to pray and stand together. The divide-and-conquer strategy is real. Many people don't see it but it is a driving force of what they're doing right now along with fear. It's obvious to those of us who see it. Many can't see through it though because the fear is paralyzing them. You sound like an intelligent person with great insight. I wish you the very best and I will keep you in my prayers 🙏❤️</p>

        <p>What in the hell is their purpose. What can they do? Remove a post or just, you know, look up my IP and lock me up. Given the shit I'd posted in the last year, I'd have had a knock on my door already. Even if someone were becoming radicalized and violent, I don't think they'd do anything. Given how many situations in the past could've been stoped but never were. More of the plan I believe. As I say, letting humanity cull itself. It's sick but I think that's how it operates.</p>
