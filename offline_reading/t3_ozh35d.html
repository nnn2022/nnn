        <p>I got banned from 3 sub Reddits today, all I did was view them and not comment or vote. There must be some pretty messed up tracking software working on Reddit.</p>

        <p>I got banned from two today. One I knew of and liked a lot, and the other I wasn’t even aware of. They must scan for certain words? I don’t know. It’s weird. I’ve never been banned from anything before. But ultimately, this subreddit is the one I care about. This community has helped me to feel less alone through everything going on. So if other subreddits ban me, so be it.</p>
