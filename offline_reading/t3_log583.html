        <p>The quality of what is published New York Times severely went down in Trump's times. Also, they abused Trump as a source of content, and now when he's gone, they have a 70% hole to fill, including the frontpage which was traditionally occupied with Trump's pictrure with a tabloid headline 'You won't believe what he said!'.</p>

        <p>This was me 5 years ago.  Eventually you will see all of these news outlets are controlled opposition.  The NY Post is filled with gatekeepers and communists, they just allow people outside of the far left to have a voice which seems like a revelation in these times.  Every conservative they have there is endorsed by the establishment.  Just food for thought.</p>

        <p>I only started reading and catching up on past content the new york times has published since Trump has been out of office. My parents are very republican and always told me the nyt was a liberal cesspool. I genuinely think they, and you, and others who espouse these opinions have never actually indulged in any content they produce. Just looking at their podcast 'the daily,' of the past 20 episodes only 2 mention or have anything to do with Trump. In addition, the guy was fucking president of course he's going to be in the news.</p>

        <p>For me it started with Steele Dossier. For me it was obvious it was typical russian fake made to stir shit in the US. RT, 1tv and Sputnik make those every week. They always insert something sexual and degrading in there (if you read these news, you'll learn that everyone who is against Putin in Russia is some kind of sexual pervert).   </p>
<p>But apparently, people who won Pulitzer Prize more than a 100 times not only didn't know any better, but were also proud of their mistake. </p>

        <p>I didnt follow the New York Times coverage on the Steele dossier so I definitely can't speak to how they handled it. But to my understanding it was TMZ who originally published it because their editor in cheif Been Smith believed that regardless of its authenticity the public had a right to see it. </p>
<p>https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/03/buzzfeed-publishing-steele-dossier-distorted-debate/586096/</p>
<p>Now regarding TMZ I would not argue that their coverage is honest and detailed and scrupulous, and I'd have to think more whether I agree with his reason. But from what I understand the Steele dossier was mostly bs and was blown out of proportion by politicians. When do we ever normally trust anything that's initially published by TMZ?</p>

        <p>'Regardless of it's authenticity'.... People who cry on every corner about 'misinformation' are the ones telling us authenticity does not matter. They used other verbal gymnastics as well, replacing the word 'false' with 'unverified'. Buzzfeed can be easily forgiven, everyone knows that buzzfeed is total trash, but NYT has a centuries-old brand name, and it is kind of said what happened to them. Also, if all things are equal, buzzfeed is just better in that genre. No paywall, shorter articles and more colorful pictures. If they are on the same level, people would prefer to go to buzzfeed. 2021 will be dark for NYT.</p>

        <p>Like I said I don't know if I agree with his reasons for publishing it, but there's a difference between publishing something knowing it's BS, and saying it's BS, and posting misinformation on the internet pretending it's true. I don't know how the NYT handled reporting on the Steele dossier, you seem to be asserting they reported it as truth, do you have articles that support that if that is what you're trying to say because I'd be interested in reading them.</p>
<p>That description sounded like a child saying "I like this book better because it has less words than this other one oh and it has pretty pictures." I will gladly pay a modest fee for 0 advertising and more accurate information over having free suspect information plagued with ads and pretty pictures in my media thanks.</p>

        <p>\&rt;  but there's a difference between publishing something knowing it's BS, and saying it's BS</p>
<p>That's not what they did.</p>
<p>\&rt; posting misinformation on the internet pretending it's true.</p>
<p>Which is exactly what they did. To the best of their ability. Where they couldn't say it was true, they said it's unverified, and 'if it is fabricated, this is a very sophisticated fabrication' [therefore, it's unlikely to be false]. It is not a very sophisticated fabrication, Igor Danchenko is not that talented, it's <a href="https://kompromat.ru">kompromat.ru</a> level of material. If they published that flat earth theory is unverified yet sophisticated, that's about same level of trash. If they justified it by 'flat earth theory is trending on twitter, therefore the public deserves to be educated on it' it's about same level of trash.</p>
<p>And of course you started throwing your 'I don't know' and 'I didn't follow'. Dude, you just pressed me for not reading NYT. I can also continue about how they interviewed Jordan Peterson, which is suprise surprise, another thing you didn't read and didn't follow, etc etc. </p>
<p>\&rt; That description sounded like a child saying "I like this book better because it has less words than this other one oh and it has pretty pictures."</p>
<p>I'm sorry but if you cater to stupid people and say that 'thinking is bad for you', you need to redesing your website and put more 'listicles' with pictures.</p>

        <p>"The draft dossier was published in full by BuzzFeed News on January 10, 2017,[11] noting that it was unverified."</p>
<p>Im not sure how you can be more clear than that honestly.  Basically saying here's this leaked information we thought was crucial to share but has not yet been verified. Anyone assuming otherwise without verifying the info would be speculating; and I suppose I'll do my own research into if the NYT did that since you're not willing to provide evidence for you claim.</p>
<p>I had to go back to make sure because I was almost certain my initial comment began with my ignorance on how the NYT covered what you were talking about, I didn't "just start" saying I don't know out of the blue. I'm practicing intellectual honesty in an effort to learn from you because you're claiming to have information I don't in something I'm interested in, instead you're just posturing to try and win an argument. It is true I didn't know about the Jordan Peterson interview and I have my own opinions on him, but ill look into that.</p>
<p>If you take a single line out of a story and claim that explains the point of the one who wrote it then the title fits perfectly for you, because you're not thinking critically at all.</p>

        <p>Jokes aside, I left in July and I'm still not done with unpacking everything I brought back and processing the feelings they bring up.  It's like dealing with a death to look at the flyers from past shows I worked on and everything.  Some of my friends who are still there insist there's about to be an arts revival, but I've had a gut feeling it isn't going to happen.  At first my reason why I thought that was, "no one can afford to live there even now," now my reasoning is that, "this is some serious brainwashing, and no one is talking about un-doing it."</p>

        <p>It's a totally different vibe from the city, at least-- people will actually hang out at a bar without obsessing over getting tested for covid or whatever.  They'll generally acknowledge that this is bullshit and they're only following the guidelines because of legal consequences, not because it makes sense.  NYC really doesn't represent the rest of NY state.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it was really strange taking a BIG step back and realizing how much even I was being brainwashed by being there!  I recently stopped having phone sessions with my old therapist from NYC because she was talking about how much sense it makes to wear 2 masks and I suddenly felt like "fuck... I'm PAYING for this, and I'M not the one getting help here!" LOL.  </p>
<p>A few of my friends there are very much still sane and willing to hang out IRL and not do that zoom bullshit, but not enough of them that staying there would have been worth it.  One of my "oh, fuck going back" moments was when 2 of my friends had an issue because one of them was hosting parties for only 10 people at a time (as Cuomo dictated) but with testing, etc, and another one was upset that she wasn't being invited to any of these parties.  And then the people going kept posting photos of the micro gatherings on social media and I just felt like it was really uncool to be that exclusive and virtue signal constantly and then give people FOMO.  Like either invite everyone and act like it's the Before Times or keep it to yourself.  That's such middle school nonsense to show off the fact that you're not inviting all your friends to a party.</p>

        <p>"Whenever you give your attention to a bad actor, you allow them to steal your attention from better treatments of an issue, and give them the opportunity to warp your perspective,” Mr. Caulfield wrote." - i.e stop reading mainstream outlets since all they want is your attention for ad revenue, they seldom care much what they write as long as it makes you click.</p>
<p>And this is just uneducated bs : "just investigate the source,” Mr. Caulfield said. He copied Mr. Kennedy’s name in the Instagram post and popped it into Google. “Look how fast this is,” he told me as he counted the seconds out loud. In 15 seconds, he navigated to Wikipedia and scrolled through the introductory section of the page, highlighting with his cursor the last sentence, which reads that Mr. Kennedy is an anti-vaccine activist and a conspiracy theorist." 
Wikipedia? I mean for actual core scientific principles it's fine, but for people or policy it's a horribly unbalanced circlejerk of extremist editors. It's the last place to go for unbiased opinions on any policy or person.</p>

        <p>Raw data. Every country puts out their COVID numbers and the news cherry picks any that have a slight uptick and blows it up into a misleading fearmongering piece of 'journalism'. But almost every country in the northern hemisphere is showing a substantial drop in cases as we speak. So I can deduce from that that COVID appears to be seasonal.</p>
<p>See, no need to listen to the fearmongering put together by a few people in an editing room. Amazing what independent research can accomplish.</p>

        <p>No, he’s saying that we shouldn’t look at alternative sources or use our better judgment to determine their truth, and should only read “trusted sources”. By that he really means mainstream outlets which are obviously corrupt and full of shit.</p>

        <p>This is from the article as his advice:</p>
<p>"1. Stop.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Investigate the source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find better coverage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trace claims, quotes and media to the original context.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise known as SIFT.</p>
<p>Mr. Caulfield walked me through the process using an Instagram post from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine activist, falsely alleging a link between the human papillomavirus vaccine and cancer. “If this is not a claim where I have a depth of understanding, then I want to stop for a second and, before going further, just investigate the source,” Mr. Caulfield said. He copied Mr. Kennedy’s name in the Instagram post and popped it into Google. “Look how fast this is,” he told me as he counted the seconds out loud. In 15 seconds, he navigated to Wikipedia and scrolled through the introductory section of the page, highlighting with his cursor the last sentence, which reads that Mr. Kennedy is an anti-vaccine activist and a conspiracy theorist."</p>
<p>What I diagree with is his statement that children being taught to think critically in school makes them more prone to disinformation. It is the opposite. And also when he said one shouldn't try to think critically about opposing voews because this can never make him disagree woth them more.</p>

        <p>if you take the time to read the article, it's pretty reasonable. It basically just says to investigate the source of the content, rather than going on a deep dive of each claim made in the content.</p>

        <p>It uses an extremely loose definition of "investigate". It says to go to some big propaganda site such as Wikipedia and then blindly believe whatever they say. They literally say</p>
<p>&rt;A SIFT fact check can and should take just 30, 60, 90 seconds to evaluate a piece of content.</p>
<p>How well can you investigate a source within 90 seconds? What they really mean is that we're too stupid to hear both sides, collect evidence, think for ourselves, and then come to a reasonable conclusion based on that; and that therefore we ought to let Wikipedia and "fact checkers" do that for us. Of course if we do that then we're easy targets for propaganda. Imagine having a society of unthinking morons who all rely on Wikipedia and a small bunch of "fact checkers" to tell them what to believe. Once the government takes over those few organisations the people would be as good as slaves. In fact, I bet the government could use something like that now that they're rolling out their CoViD-1984 regime.</p>

        <p>Wikipedia is useful to get general information about what an author has said or done in the past, to find out if they would be biased when writing about a topic. For example, it would make sense to be skeptical about a scientist who published a paper that says sugar-based drinks are harmless, if he turns out to be the brother of the CEO of coca-cola. Having that stuff written down on a centralized page like wikipedia is very useful.</p>
