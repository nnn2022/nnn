    <strong>China situation</strong>
    <p><p>Just got informed from a girl who's been living in China for the last two years that, at least in Zhengzhou, that's the current situation: </p>
<p>Masks are not mandatory and nobody wears them</p>
<p>Injections aren't mandatory and people actually have a choice whether or not to get them</p>
<p>You don't have to be regularly tested</p>
<p>Not exactly what we're told, looks like the Chinese have more freedom in that regard, as weird as it sounds. Probably because they're under government control anyway so not much would change</p></p>

        <p>That's because China was in a trade war and crashed the world's economy to get out of a losing battle. Of course people in China will have more freedom otherwise the lockdowns across the world (except China) were pointless.</p>

        <p>We were doing great in regards to the economy and Trump was trying to build trade treaties with Western powers that would reduce our reliance on China and bring manufacturing back into the West. An example is the UMCA Trade Agreement for North America. At the same time we were in a trade war with China that were raising the price of Chinese goods and forcing consumers to buy American products or products made elsewhere.</p>
<p>China retaliated by leaking Covid from a lab in Wuhan and communicated with Fauci and world organizations on pushing for lockdowns. George Gao of the Chinese CDC was Fauci's contact in China and Kristian Anderson of the NIH was the one that warned him about the Wuhan lab leak.</p>
<p>These lockdowns caused the economy to grind to a halt and would later cause major problems such as shortages, lack of workers, and inflation. Meanwhile China was operating normally and began to lift restrictions on Wuhan as the rest of the world went into lockdown. While the US is struggling with shortages and workers, China is able to import goods across the world.</p>
<p>The trade war is effectively over and the US lost but its a small battle of a bigger conflict. Trump posed more than just an economic threat to China because his policies meant peace with North Korea, a secured South China Sea, and less Chinese influence in America such as the Huawei ban and strict measures against China buying American lands.</p>
<p>Sadly it won't stop with Biden in office. China wants to expand and it still thinks America is a threat.</p>

        <p>During the initial states of the pandemic they had to scan a qr code in their phones to enter public places like malls. Made it easier to track the spread. We can't do such things in USA. The democracy won't allow it</p>
