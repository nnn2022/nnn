    <p><p>If you think it was planned... how long in advance do you think the planning was and who do you think was involved?</p></p>

        <p>The China lab that leaked the virus was researching it for years prior. It could have been an honest mistake because Chinese safety standards are so lacking compared to other leading countries like Australia and U.S.A. It Probably leaked by accident but China took 3 months to warn the world while they closed down their own towns and contained it from
Spreading into mainland China. But China kept European boarders open to allow it to spread. They took advantage of the situation and now many companies are being bought out for pennies on the dollar. China now owns the largest pork processing plant in America. How is this allowed?</p>

        <p>I think it may have been planned by China as a bioweapon against the West, to decimate the economies and basically make us more like them, with government tracking and stuff. I will not rule out the idea of it being planned by a bunch of countries, but it seems like the people in power right now wouldn't have the competence level to pull that off, TBH.</p>

        <p>We should quit with the nations thing, cuz government is the enemy, both the elites in China and the West want to enslave us. If the elites released a genetically engineered virus they don’t want to die themselves, but at the same time if their purpose is to scare people that has worked well. Well enough that people are lining up for the vaccine...which is what I believe is one of the main objectives. The experimental vaccine for SARS (or some other variant) enhanced the severity of the disease when used on soldiers. I’m no wiz when it comes to these things, but I’ve heard of phrases such as “Cytokine storm” which reference terrible reactions brought about from the vaccine. One theory I have is that the harmless virus in tangent with the not so harmless vaccine is what truly makes the bioweapon function as it should. Whereas the elites don’t take the vaccine, or take it on tv and get to enjoy as the commoners are slaughtered. But that’s just my theory, I hope it’s wrong because I don’t want a lot of people I care about who’ve fallen for the fear to be killed.</p>

        <p>I was being facetious </p>
<p>Its never been isolated, the tests can't and don't detect it, it only kills people over the average life expectancy. There is no novel virus, it is the manipulation of cause of death statistics and fear mongering on screens. After going over any CDC or other 'official' statistics, there is no way a logical and reasonable person can come away thinking there is any threat whatsoever. It baffles me that nobody actually reads the numbers that are 'officially' released.</p>

        <p>You think the talking head politicians are the ones making decisions, and that whatever is announced to the gen pop is actually a decision that matters?  The world works on a need to know basis and you aren't on the list. Everything happening has been planned for decades if not centuries, and is going exactly according to plan.</p>

<p>What I meant was that he is under stress, and I think that's because he's executing a plan he got from higher-ups. And the people are getting more and more agitated.</p>
<p>I don't know about scandinavian politics, but I think politicians are similar all over the world. Not much has changed since the ancient romans. Corruption, backstabbing, hidden agendas, you name is. It takes a certain kind of person to want to be in that world and to thrive in it.</p>

<p>These comments seem to think China created some supervirus that is decimating the population and killing 50% of people who comes in contact with it.  </p>
<p>M5M said it was leaked from a lab in Wuhan, or a bat in Wuhan 10 months ago. People are still going with this bullshit narrative?  It's the flu and ALL statistics indicate this</p>

        <p>Every corporation and bank. Anyone who is uber rich and has considerable influence in the private world. Even most if not all of the politicians too, which are already owned and used in the first place, whether they know it or not. </p>
<p>They control everything. From the food we consume, to the news we watch, to the banks we bank in. Even our politicians. Most of them at least. To the point where even any real politicians with spine can't do anything without being surrounded by sellout hounds in office. They give us an illusion that it's a free market and a honest republic but instead what we have is crony capitalism and rigged elections to the highest degree. As you saw in the 2020 election, obviously they (s)elected the most crony man there is. We are in the midst of class warfare and it has always been about that for decades. </p>
<p>One big famous example of a globalist would be Bill Gates. He and his foundation was responsible for funding Event 201 which was a simulation of a pandemic in October 2019 of which many rich folk attended.</p>
<p>It doesn't take that long to connect the dots. It is not even a conspiracy anymore. It is fact that elite have been getting their payday with corona. Our system has always been more of an illusion. Wish it was any other way though. No-one asked for these people to control our world.</p>

        <p>Governments struggle to collect the bins on time, the idea that they could plan something as extensive as this or reasonably believe that it would be successful is - how shall I say? - unlikely in the extreme. </p>
<p>It simply follows a cast iron law of politics: never let a good crisis go to waste.</p>

        <p>Taken advantage of.</p>
<p>Most of the 'evidence' people use to say it was all planned is just contingency papers, of which governments run dozens on every conceivable scenario. Sometimes, they use predictions and go "aha! See! They were talking about a pandemic in 2014!" Well, yeah - there was one in 2009. They're quite regular. I can predict a volcanic eruption in the next five years and be right,  though I haven't had a volcanic eruption machine since the last one broke in 70,000 BC. I can also predict the next California earthquake will occur. It doesn't mean I sit there with a wrench trying to make it happen.</p>

        <p>Total coincidence for sure.  The facts that there are no excess deaths compared to recent years and that nobody has died outside of senior citizens living in nursing homes, who are on death's doorstep, are obvious indicators that the pandemic is real.  Add in that the flu- i mean novel virus has never been isolated and the tests don't even test for it, and it's case closed, just another massively ridiculous coincidence that it was immediately taken advantage of to implement tyranny.</p>

        <p>Half planned, half Chinese incompetence. I’m pretty sure China had been working on Rona and was actually trying to make it dangerous for later use/biological warfare. But due to their incompetence it got leaked early and they tried to suppress it as best as they could. </p>
<p>When that failed they started misinformation campaigns to make it seem worse than it is to distract away from themselves. </p>
<p>Make other countries get so scared of this minor little bug that they’ll focus on their own crap and not all point their guns at us if you will. </p>
<p>It was mostly just a perfect coincidence for governments looking for a way to oppress people without outright doing so. And they rolled with it. </p>
<p>Once China realized the focus was off of them they went back to business as normal. Cause let’s be honest? If this is so bad, and wuhan is where it started? Why the hell is it business as usual there? </p>
<p>Because were so focused on destroying ourselves while they build up their empire and swoop in and hit us when we’re down.</p>

        <p>I think it was 100% planned.  Just absolutely planned.  The WHO's early denial of it, the democratic officials in government telling everyone to go play, the signing of executive orders by democratic governors to force nursing homes to keep covid patients, the immediate refusal to agree with anything Trump said...  It all makes sense that it was planned. </p>
<p>The first objective was to get as many people sick as possible (nursing homes especially).  That's why they needed everyone to go play outside.  They needed bodies.  Then, once they had bodies, they were able to blow it up using the media- They made a few bodies look like a LOT of bodies.  Then, they had their fear- and they fed it and fed and fed it.  The SAME day in March, all Democratic governors and officials and the WHO and Dr. Fauci, and Nanci Pelosi immediately flipped from, "Go play outside" to "This virus is going to kill us all!  Trump failed us!  He told us the virus wasn't deadly!!!" </p>
<p>It was a very predictable script, but it worked.  It worked REALLY WELL.  Then, they shut down small businesses.  Billionaires got even richer.  We got poorer.</p>

        <p>Taken advantage of. Once it began spreading through the world there was such mass panic driven by the media. The images coming out of Italy with the overflowing hospital hallways and dead bodies with tarps over them before it hit North America propelled the fear. In the Spring everyone seemed to be scared, we didn't know what it was, we were hearing huge death rates and I was even ok with lockdown to protect my family. But once it started coming out how actual non deadly it is to the majority of the population it should have changed the approach taken by government. Instead, locking things down made their popularity and approval ratings soar. The population has become so conditioned so quickly it's scary. The politicians know Covids not going away with masks and lockdowns but everytime they increase measures, their approval skyrockets, so why would they follow the science?</p>

        <p>It was known from the start (march, april) that it was all about the vaccine. The dutch health minister literally said a vaccine is the only way out. There was no way for him to know that at that point, since vaccines aren't that easy to make, especially against coronaviruses. He couldn't have known if some effective treatment or prevention would be discovered in a month or 2.</p>
<p>Since then, he shot down every treatment (hcq, evermectine, even vitamin D) and ridiculed every scientist in his way.</p>
<p>He also passed a law making it legal to use nanoparticles in vaccines in october 2019, without any real need or cause. That was before covid even was a thing.</p>

        <p>The two are not mutually exclusive.  Statistically there is a new infectious virus every year or so.  A fair number go global.  So you plan and then take advantage when it happens.</p>
<p>IMHO this one was a bit of a disappointment to some.  They would have preferred a virus as lethal as MERS. But hey, you take what you can get.</p>
