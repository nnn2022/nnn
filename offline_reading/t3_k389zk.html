        <p>Anyone else old enough to remember 9/11? Within 24 hours of the attacks, politicians and media were saying the world had changed forever. They made it happen that way with PATRIOT Act etc.</p>
<p>Now we have corona. Again they immediately come out with the "new normal" talking point. They will never let us have the old normal.</p>

        <p>&rt;Anyone else old enough to remember 9/11? </p>
<p>Yes, I was 17.  Six years later, I was patrolling the streets of Iraq.</p>
<p>And I will always remember 9/11 as the end of 20th century America.  Not in terms of the date, but in terms of the psychological shift that occurred in its aftermath.  It's hard to explain how radical that shift was to people who didn't experience it.</p>

        <p>Right there with you. I was 17 then but i never signed up to serve. The whole thing wreaked of BS and manipulation. I remember within days of the attack was the first time I ever heard the word “Islamophobia”, and I’m like...What? The only ones fomenting that is the news.  The Patriot Act had a “sunset clause” of 3 years so of course everyone said, “oh okay—we’ll just let you crap all over the constitution then.” And it gets renewed in a budget bill every single year. What a joke.</p>

        <p>It feels like I've been going through the five stages of grief backwards. I'm done with anger and am about to reach denial. I'm inches away from flat out denying the existence as a human being to whoever is still peddling this virus mania. If you worry about COVID, you're now out of my life.</p>

        <p>My cousin got it 3 months ago and still has trouble breathing due to its effect on her lungs.  She was pretty healthy too and only 46.  Numerous other people I know have also gotten sick and while not as bad it out them out just like a bad flu for a few weeks.  Have you had a bad flu before...it fucking sucks.</p>

        <p>Posting here because Im not sure where else to talk about this. Like many people, I am seriously concerned about the impacts of the lockdown on the economy and peoples lives. Selfishly though, I sincerely think that this lockdown is affecting my mental stability. I haven’t been able to really leave my house in six months, work keeps piling up, I have an income so I should be “thankful”, but working from home makes me incredibly depressed. I lost both of my grandfathers in a weeks time (apparently due to covid but both were already in hospice for a ton of illnesses at the time) and wasn’t able to bury them. Ive been dealing with Leukemia. All of that stuff I can handle, what I CAN’t handle are my friends and people I see online shaming any amount of dissent. I see friends post pictures at massive protest events. They all went out and celebrated when Biden won. When asked about it, either I get no response or handwaving about “most of the people wore masks so its ok”. If the virus is so fucking deadly, why is it ok to go to super spreader events as long as you feel morally justified by some political issue? Im not trying to downplay the racial issues in the US but if this was actually some horrifying plague wouldn’t we be condemning ANY mass gatherings? The hypocrisy is so unreal, and the lack of any argument against my point here is making me feel so disconnected from my friends and society that I can barely sleep at night.</p>

        <p>Hi, I'm new here. It's great to finally have a place to talk about this without people telling me I'm a selfish a-hole that wants to murder people's grandmas. I feel like I really don't have anyone to talk to about something so important to me as this. I am absolutely sickened by the government overreach and the fact that many people are just okay with it and even agree with it. And it just seems like it will never end. First it was a few weeks, then another month, then another month, now they don't even have a timeline anymore. It just seems like it will never stop. There are some protests, which make me really happy, but they don't seem to actually change anything. There is a ton of pushback against this, but nothing changes. It's like there's no end in sight. This is why I'm so glad there is a place like this. I've lost lifelong friends over this, and I can't tell people that because they just tell me I deserve it. I will not ever wear a face diaper. First, because it's just crazy, and second because I pratice a strict form of Christianity and we don't believe in covering our faces. I just can't believe how insane this has gotten.</p>

        <p>Been like this in Singapore since June 2020. In fact they're taking it one step further now by rolling out Bluetooth dongles for all Singaporeans that will track your movements and interactions with Bluetooth beacons placed everywhere. Of course they're feeding us the bullshit that they'll only trace our movements only if someone gets COVID and they need to contact trace. I for one don't believe any bit of it.   </p>

        <p>Boy... If you think this is bad, there's worse.</p>
<p>Since November the government here has forcibly mandated all foreign manual labourers living in dormitories to wear a similar token permanently on their wrists like a smart watch. It's not just Bluetooth. It's freaking GPS TRACKING as well. People have gotten nabbed because the tokens recorded them going to out of bound areas on their limited hours allowed out of their dormitories that they have TO APPLY EXIT PASSES FOR. It's literal electronic tagging on the same level as you'd subject a criminal under curfew or house arrest. And they are threatened with a $10'000 fine or six months in jail if they tamper or otherwise lose it.</p>
<p>Not something you'll read in the mainstream news. I only know of this because I used to work in an industry that employed vast numbers of such workers.</p>

        <p>Is there an official Australian government web page outlining these regulations somewhere? I want to show it to the zombies...but somehow I think they’d just explain it away and mindlessly consider it “good”. </p>
<p>Anyhow i need to see it for my own mental health—just so i can feel vindicated.</p>

        <p>Oh i misread. I heard about some really dystopian stuff going down in Australia. Singapore—as screwed up as this mess is—surprises me less, because they’ve always had a very overly strict disposition towards even the pettiest of “criminal” behavior.</p>
<p>But really this is just totally sobering. It’s a very real possibility that these sorts of measures will be put in place soon. First it’s a mandatory tracer bracelet. Not that far away from an implant, tbh.</p>

        <p>I never wanted to believe the general population were this weak of heart, I honestly thought that when push came to shove we would snap out of our comfortable numb bubbles. But I am forced to come to terms with the fact that the vast majority of humans are indeed stupefied beyond return.
I know the weapons forged against us are powerful and unmatched in speed and distance (MSM/Tech)
But those weapons have finally overpowered the human spirit. At least it has for the majority.
The basic principles of virology/human sciences are heresy to anyone I have spoken to about covid.
You know, major factors like Immunity and how the body actually works.
Beyond that it’s as if people have zero awareness of history repeating itself in the form of snitch culture appealing to tyrannical rule.
I remember the first time I read the Gulag Archipelago I felt sick from the recounts of how people would betray their own friends and family, snitching on them to secret police out of fear they themselves could be seen as a traitor for staying quiet (“I’ll drown you so I may stay afloat” mentality).
It’s super dangerous the road we are walking down while the majority of people are swaying to the war drums.</p>

At least the temp warehouses don't require a doctor's note if you call in sick, they only "require" a doctor's note and don't bat an eyelid if you never actually call in.

        <p>Here's something really hopeful. A well known, notably hard left poweruser on Canadian subs is now saying masks don't work. I'm serious, he is posting very high quality arguments in support of this position and has clearly followed the science quite closely. I can't link him directly because it might be implied to be raiding, but I'm really happy to think the tide might be turning:</p>
<p>&rt;"Home made and Etsy type masks are totally unregulated, untested and inadequate. Surgical 'procedure' masks aren't even designed to catch aerosol. Consumer testing using NIOSH tests showed varying levels of effectiveness but NIOSH tests are done on the fabric without consideration of fit. Unless you tape the mask all the way around to your face, home made 3 layer polypro masks that might be as effective as an N95 are going to leak and you will get infected. Even an N95 is insufficient when spending time in an enclosed space with an infected person. From about day 2 through day 11 of a Covid infection, (even asymptomatic) people are shedding enough virus in their breath to infect about a thousand others every few minutes. Your trip on the bus is sufficient to get infected even if everyone on the bus is wearing N95 masks and clearly N95 masks are not being worn by most people."</p>

        <p>Have to be careful with this one. This guy might actually be advocating for some more extreme mask that inhibits your breathing and makes you feel faceless even more so than what we have.
He sounds like a guy I know he keeps saying everyone is not doing enough. One of the types that thinks every business should shut down completely and lose their livelihood or they are selfish</p>

        <p>he wants a lockdown, which is still novel policy here. But we have the strongest evidence of all that lockdowns do not work while the mask question is still muddled to the average person. If we win on the obvious point that there are no measures capable of stopping the spread of covid (there aren't), it's over. Middle class people do not want to lose their businesses while wall mart gobbles up the profits</p>

        <p>My personal opinion on masks is similar in regards to efficacy, especially as someone who worked an essential job for six months without one, and having friends who work in the medical field who see wearing them everywhere as pointless.
At this point I believe they are there more for psychological reasons to reassure people they are safe to return to work. 
For those of us who don’t like doing things that make no sense, like seeing human faces, and have anxiety with masks for t he opposite reason, they are a nightmare with these mandates</p>

        <p>Wait, lockdowns don’t work? I personally believe they do, if they are implemented correctly. If everyone actually quarantined for 2-3 weeks, we would most likely either be done with the pandemic, or there would be fewer deaths. If you believe masks and lockdowns don’t work, do you have any ideas on what would?</p>

        <p>I typically avoid r/coronavirus like the plague (which is kinda ironic.) However sometimes you can get some good discussions from the daily discussion thread at the top. I guess not anymore. Mods will delete any comment that isn't doom and gloom.</p>
<p>I just had comments deleted that were essentially saying "the vast majority of people, especially under 65, will experience mild symptoms if any at all." You know, a factually true statement. Deleted for "not being high quality information." What the hell. So there's literally no point in debating people on this site, because they literally refuse to even hear opposing viewpoints.</p>
<p>My only option is to continue ignoring that subreddit (and, hate to say it, most of reddit. Most subs have gone to shit since March.)</p>

<p>Most websites in general. I got into a heavy debate on notalwaysright.com, of all places. The admin of that website are officially of the "no mask automatically equals bad" variety, despite the entire damn website is about stories of bad customers. They have stories of freaking robbery, theft, and a few of being murdered, yet somehow, lack of a mask is the absolute worst.</p>
<p>Also, apparently, it's impossible to be an essential worker with a health condition if you're against masks. Never mind the fact I wear one (my job depends on it). Just not thinking the "right" way makes me equivalent to a serial killer. Hell, I got called selfish in that debate for not considering my health everyone else's problem.</p>
<p>You just can't argue with people like that. Really got to wonder how the hell they lived to reach 2020 to begin with.</p>

        <p>So, I personally believe that a mask is the responsible thing to wear. It’s less about you wearing a mask to protect yourself, but more about the people around it. If you do wear a mask, I want to applaud you for being a caring citizen who respects the people around them. If not, I would like you to consider wearing a mask not only to protect your family and loved ones but also everyone in the world. I may be wrong, but I do believe masks do help with this pandemic and slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>

        <p>Just a short little rant here. r/Covidiots is absolutely insane. Many posts encourage hateful behavior towards others without provocation. Like people post stories of them seeing someone at a walmart without a mask then confront and insult that person. Maybe just mind your own business instead and get on with your life. Let people make their own life decisions. I feel like that sub is made up of mostly narcissists that use mask mandates as an excuse to be assholes.</p>

        <p>Ok, so people should have their own decisions, but not wearing a mask is affecting other people. So, if you decide to not wear a mask, and you get COVID-19, that’s fine because it was your choice. But the part that is not fine is the fact that other people who ARE wearing masks may get it and pass away, which is you deciding when they die. So the fights aren’t concerning the one persons decision, they are about the effect of their decision on other people around them. Does that make any sense?</p>

You weren't running around demanding people wear masks every winter when they weren't sick before this year, the common cold is a killer to these people so what's your excuse for not caring then?

        <p>A common thing observed in most countries like the UK, France, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea etc, is how the hospitality, tourism, and nightlife leisure industries have all been somehow hung out to dry by their governments. Bunged a bit of cash here and there, but nothing concrete to support their survival or help them earn their own survival keep to tide through the pandemic. These industries aren't crying out for more handouts. They're crying out for a fighting chance to operate and earn money.</p>
<p>I don't know what's driving government miserly behaviour towards them, is it a sense of "they aren't critical"? Industries like hospitality, tourism, and nightlife leisure industries employ far more people as part of the pre-pandemic "value added service" economic sectors much of the world has adopted wholesale than government care to acknowledge or recognise. But they're right at the back of the queue for financial support or aid, and the very last in a whole list of priorities for business sectors to reopen and parts of societal life to resume pre-pandemic activity.</p>
<p>Or is it a deeper moral objection that sees this as a golden opportunity to "cleanse" their societies of vice and independent leisure and entertainment?</p>
<p>Try explaining again coherently why it makes sense to get people back on crowded public transport, to commute back to work again, to eat out in restaurants when they're actually allowed to open (as the barest minimum of "leisure" that us the masses get bunged with apart from resorting to the great outdoors, which not all of us have access to depending on where we live), to send kids and working adults back to schools and universities to teach in person again, when the conditions all these activities exist in are no different from that of all the leisure and tourism activities we've been banned from enjoying?</p>
<p>Society we live in now has become so atomised and sterile, and everyone simply accepts this as a necessary thing to combat a pandemic but not stopped to think of the wider transference of power and societal control into the hands of a select few in power, who think they can act as and how they see fit as long as they supposedly have the popular mandate won with periodic elections! This Brave New World of ours will form a frankenstein global society where reliance on Big Corp/Big Pharma/Big Government/Big Entertainment is practically inbuilt in some kind of eternal war against future pandemics, real or imagined. The amount of individual autonomy and societal human power being surrendered will have no sunset clause. No oversight. Driven by opportunistic leverage of ever-shifting scientific interpretations and proclamations of risk and doom from disease, by scientists who are every bit as biased as everyone else but refuse to acknowledge their bias accordingly.</p>
<p>A world where the only way to live is to treat everything like a petri-dish in a sterile laboratory, is not a world worth living in. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Because vaccine or no vaccine, this "New Normal" ain't going to turn back time to the world we were in before November 2019.</p>

        <p>The hospitality industry is where working/middle class people go to enjoy and benefit from the pleasures of civilization.  Clamping down on that gives the oligarchs huge power over the masses that can be used as a weapon against them.  Kind of like a mafia boss who says, <em>"It'd be a real shame if you couldn't go to a restaurant or a movie for the next five months..."</em></p>

        <p>My point exactly. Want entertainment to get away from work? All you have left is Netflix... With shows WE pre approve of. Want actual physical sex as a single person but can't go out to mingle, hook up, or call an escort? All you have left is porn and OnlyFans...all digital, all designed to hook you in and fleece the hell out of you financially. Want to drink? Sorry, bars are closed. You shouldn't be drinking anyway because we decide that it's bad for your health, fuck what you actually want to do, and if you still wanna drink well you can jolly well do it yourself at home staring at your Netflix screen. Want your shopping? Sure, buy everything online, where 99% of the shit is cheap only because its made in sweatshop factories in Communist China which has a human rights record that makes Nazi Germany look good. </p>
<p>Need I go on with this dystopia?</p>

        <p>I literally stood in line at the store last night for 5 minutes next to one of my good friends. I didn't recognize her until she got outside and took off her GMC (Government Mandated Cloth™). I thought it might have been her, but since half of someone's face is covered, I had no clue. She didn't see me either even though I don't wear a mask because no one even makes eye contact anymore. </p>
<p>It was so sad and sobering.</p>

<li>I want to never see a covered face again. </li>

<p>And, curiously, if that wish were fulfilled, <a href="http://12160.info/m/blogpost?id=2649739:BlogPost:2035264">probably nothing bad</a> would happen. Face-covering makes sense only in very special situations.  For example, to periodically remind ourselves how awful it is. </p>

<p>In all the talks, some issues have been treated without any discussion.  One is fear.  I've heard an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbRfg437f4s">advice</a>, banish all fear about the future. We have nothing to fear.  And we've all heard of 'We should fear only fear itself.'  On the other hand, there's a strong fear-mongering... but there is also the wise reminder that the feeling of fear is an inner guidance for us provided for us by Nature / the Creator, and we should appreciate it like a helpful gift in our lives. </p>

<p>The last few days, my father has asked me every day some version of "have you got any big exciting news?" I don't know what answer he is expecting!! Everything I want to do is forbidden, I work from home, I'm home basically 24/7 apart from running some errands...what big exciting news could I <em>possibly</em> have for him?! </p>

        <p>Supposedly for COVID-19, most businesses are not allowed to let customers use the toilet. Though a few businesses are still allowed to let customers use their toilets. The result is that everyone goes to the same few toilets. How is this supposed to stop the spreading of COVID-19? Seems pretty counter-productive to let everyone sit on the same few toilets if COVID-19 is so bad as it supposedly is. And just to make it clear: those toilets that we're allowed to use are not special toilets; they're just the same like all other toilets. The only difference is that there are less toilets now.</p>
<p>Also, the stores will soon be forced to close earlier here. Guess what the result of that will be? You give people a shorter time span to buy their groceries. Are they going to buy groceries less often and suffer hunger? Of course not. They're just going to buy their groceries during that shorter time span i.e. more people will buy their groceries at the same time. How exactly does that promote anti-social distancing? (That's how I call it BTW, isolating yourself out of germafobia is anti-social behaviour.)</p>
<p>It's as if these measures are just there to mock and inconvenience us and to prove to themselves that we're complete idiots who will believe and comply with the most ridiculous things that they can come up with.</p>

        <p>Sitting here on a (non-work) Zoom meeting for an organization I’m in. Meetings moved to Zoom because of cases “spiking” in our county. And of course we are having no Christmas party because “it’s not safe” (like we are some 50-100 person organization; there’s like seven of us on this call) and “hopefully we’ll have a vaccine next year.” It’s like Doomer Bingo and we haven’t even been online for 15 minutes.</p>

<p>COVID-19 doesn't erase clincial depression. No virus does. That's not how it works.</p>
<p>There's a reason isolation is a symptom of depression and solitary confinement is considered torture.</p>
<p>We get past it when/if the governors (who don't follow their own rules!) decide to lift their lockdowns. That's not the citizens' choice.</p>

        <p>I went in Facebook for the first time in about a month last weekend and saw a post from a local group with a big image applauding the idea of curfews. It said some propaganda twaddle like "it's not curfew its care for you" and I couldn't take the blatant bullshit that was so many people agreeing with it, anyone disagreeing even politely was being harassed. One person called another a Trump supporter, this is a small local Facebook group in the UK! The commenter didn't even mention anything American, just disagreed with the post.</p>

        <p>I always hate when shit like that is framed as "care for <em>you</em>". Like, I don't want anyone to go out of their way to protect me from coronavirus. If they are framing it as "Protecting the most vulnerable among us", I can understand it more, although I don't see what purpose a curfew really serves. But the care "for you", reinforces the idea that everyone should be concerned for their own sake of getting the virus, which is just irrational considering car crash deaths are more common for ages &lt;45</p>

But making stupid comments on here like telling some gay guy who commented that "nobody wants to be his friend because he just likes to go round infecting people" shouldn't be met with just mere community downvotes.</p>

        <p>I actually prefer when mods don't delete troll/shill/bot comments. Especially the most violent, vitriolic, hateful, incoherent comments. I want people on the fence to see how absolutely unhinged the COVID hyterics really are. Just a few days or so ago, someone said "wear a mask at least to prevent me from shitting down your throat". I'd almost like to see them try.</p>

        <p>I'm tired of people wearing masks OUTSIDE.... and by themselves away from people.  I made a decision that I would not be wearing one unless forced.</p>
<p>And the media regurgitating old information.</p>
<p>I also happen to live in Florida, we are open.  I am alive and have never had the 'Rona.  I have tested negative twice via blood test... nothing.  One vent I have is ALL THE DAMN BS concerning FLORIDA.  I wish the media would get the f--- out of here and STOP their s---.  I saw an article on the Sun Sentinel trashing our governor and I keep praying.  All around me, everyone is normal.  I have not been isolated, been working in the office since May 26th... don't wear a mask, do not socially distance.  Most of us are here in Florida, not sick, and we are all pretty much disgusted.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But I'm wrong you know... so wrong.  I feel like screaming at people wearing masks... I feel like going to these locked down states and helping these people out... I am not depressed, more disgusted with the people who won't let this go.  Keep it up news... keep it up "President-elect".... and let me see YOU lock yourself up.</p>

        <p>Living in a state that experiences winter I'm wearing my mask outside a ton. Mostly because it keeps my face warm. A warm face makes me happy, something something pursuit of happiness. </p>
<p>The fact that it fucks with facial recognition also makes me happy, all of the shitty stores around here use cheap Chinese security cameras which are known to phone home. Paranoid? Totally, but it's somewhat justified after I bought several IP cameras for dirt cheap off Aliexpress and discovering that they were constantly trying to connect to Chinese IP addresses when I put them on my network. </p>
<p>My face/data/whatever is quite literally worthless but it's the point of the matter. Fuck data harvesting, fuck those who participate in it willingly, and hardcore fuck the people who utilize that data to sell pointless shit. 5 years at a company that leveraged the ever loving hell out of harvested fb, ig, youtube data for marketing left a bad taste in my mouth. Not a single line of that 4tb database was given with consent, you can thank FB's utter incompetence with their early APIs for that. Felt pretty damn good nuking those AWS instances when the shitheel boss tried to fuck me over, although I did feel a twinge of remorse for the VAs in the philippines that had to find another $3/hour job after.</p>
<p>TLDR: Masks make my face warm in the winter, idgaf bout much else.</p>

        <p>This has been impacting me since March and still is; basically, I'm studying in Australia as an international student and they have not allowed me to even enter back inside the country due to their tight border closures, despite me having a valid visa.         <br>
I've been studying both semesters online ever since for the entire year back in my home country and it's been horrible to pay full tuition and not meet a single friend I have back there for the whole year.       <br>
And now more information has come out suggesting I still might not be able to come back in 2021 itself. If this happens I would've spent more time in my home country than I have in Australia. This entire year I've just felt so lonely, depressed, and always in a constant state of anxiety about the future as it almost never seems to get better.       <br>
Idk I'm just really losing my mind over this, needed to vent this out. I'm missing out on a once in a lifetime opportunity I'm paying so much money for and getting treated this way.</p>

        <p>It's indeed a scam :/ unfortunately, I'm in the last year of my degree so it'll feel kind of a waste if I drop out now since it's a fairly prestigious school. 100% would've if I was just starting out though.       <br>
Although I am planning to take half a gap year if they won't allow for me for 2021, no way am I graduating in my bedroom</p>

        <p>I don't know how many of you are familiar with Master Pancake, but they are a troupe in Austin that used to essentially perform a real life version of MST3K. Well they had a stream of one of their performances last night. The 3 riffers were on camera at their respective homes.</p>
<p>Everything was great until the last 5 minutes of the stream. They then announced that they would be holding a fundraiser for the Georgia senate runoff (in favor of the democrats, of course) and that Republicans in congress are being assholes by withholding covid stimulus. No, we don't need another useless stimulus, we need everything to open. They sure do know their base, a bunch of middle class, WFH goons that don't have an ounce of common sense.</p>
<p>It's a shame because I enjoy MP but it's very disappointing to see them shilling for something that will ultimately be detrimental to their livelihoods and the city that put them on the map.</p>

        <p>Update on mask compliance at my 2 grocery stores:</p>
<p>Local grocery store:</p>
<p>4 weeks ago approximately 85 percent with masks</p>
<p>Currently approximately 50 percent with masks</p>
<p>Local Walmart:</p>
<p>3 weeks ago approximately 70 percent with masks</p>
<p>Currently approximately 45 percent with masks</p>
<p>I don't know what happened in the last few weeks but I was blown away by the change!!!</p>
<p>(State has mask mandate, but I am over 40 miles from the closest major city.)</p>

        <p>Anyone else here complying for now but plans to stop after the vaccine is released? A lot of my friends want the masks and distancing to remain to fight the flu etc. I even bought a gas mask to wear on the metro etc so I am sort of pro mask and lockdown at the moment but I cant keep going forever either.</p>

        <p>My husband and I haven't been complying so much at all, but we might begin picking our battles a bit more wisely from now on. All year, we've disregarded mask mandates by either pulling up our bandanas for 30 seconds to get past security OR just not masking up at all, but Walmart recently hired new security that actually chased us through the store harassing us to wear a mask last time we went. And while we'd love to deny Walmart (also Amazon) our business, there isn't really anywhere else nearby we can shop because big corporations have been killing off small businesses since long before we were old enough to vote with our wallet. So we'll probably keep our bandanas up in Walmart and possibly other stores from now on. But if the vaccine is made mandatory through either force or coercion, all bets are off. We ain't complying with that shit.</p>

        <p>The problem with so many of the "Distance Learning" is that it consists mostly of "read this and answer these questions". Distance learning could work, but it would require a lot more effort. Teachers need to have recorded, or at best live sessions, with a board and with them in person. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFRWDuduuSw&amp;list=PL3B08AE665AB9002A">Take a look at this Calculus distance learning course from the 1970s</a>, by the later Professor Herbert Gross, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkZ6Q67Q15E&amp;list=PL259DBFA47F3B4761">or this Accounting Class  from 2011</a>. Of course, such learning format is not for everyone. But is is much better than the half ass "Courses" that are being peddled as a "good education".</p>

        <p>I'm worried about being confronted for not wearing a mask on my face when I walk down the hall of my condo complex. Yesterday someone was like, "Excuse me!" as I walked past. I'm pretty sure they were talking to me but I ignored them. I've started taking out my garbage and recycling when I go to work in the morning to save myself the risk of being seen when the halls are more populated. </p>
<p>I'm worried it's going to get worse, especially when Biden does the 100 day mask thing. If it gets bad I might go temporarily stay with my family since they live reasonably closeby and I can handle living with them better than people harassing me in my own home.</p>

        <p>Is there any sub to discuss covid skepticism that isn't majority religious zealotry and misogyny?  Just wanted to have a place to discuss with and vent to like minded people, but the constant left field comments bashing women and atheists are going to drive me out.</p>

        <p>Had my first COVID-related dream:</p>
<p>Was in a house having (what started as) a small house party, but quickly grew in size beyond my comfort level. I started panicking when some of the attendees were arguing with people outside the house - surely alerting them to the illegally-large gathering inside.</p>
<p>I ended up leaving the house in panic, walking around outside (now daylight), through a big green park. But I noticed in astonishment that everywhere I looked, people were walking freely, happy, few if any masks in sight! What was I so worried about? Nobody cared anymore! People were living their lives without concern for fearmongers.</p>
<p>Don't remember much detail beyond that but there was a very positive, hopeful glow to that scene that I woke up with. Maybe we'll pull through this mass hysteria yet, with our humanity intact?</p>

        <p>Are there evidence based downsides to mask wearing in the long term? Personally I support it now, but I'm concerned some people will try to backdoor masks into becoming some universal thing in the long term for the sake of protecting immunocompromised people. But it seems like long term mask usage would probably be a bad thing for other reasons. Let's put arguements about Liberty aside for a second - are there studies showing that wearing them all the time is bad for your immune system/ability to communicate with others or something like that? I personally hate the idea of long term mask wearing but I feel kinda guilty when people frame it as protecting immunocompromised people, and I'm worried people are gonna try and guilt trip society into wearing masks all the time, perhaps at the expense of other things.</p>

        <p>Went to the park today, there was a huge party thrown by a Mexican party (they spoke Spanish in a Mexican accent), not a mask in site. I've always found it interesting how the Latino community in my city is the least dommerish. Go to a Latino owned restaurant or store, there are any signs about mask, the staff don't wear masks, the regualrs don't wear masks. In fact, they will speak about how stupid they think it is in the open, only in Spanish though, pretty much noone of the "Karen types" understand any Spanish.</p>

        <p>People need to be educated about WHY you should where a mask. The mask prevents YOUR saliva from infecting other people. Yes, if it becomes wet it can increase the chance you catch the virus if you happen to come in contact with it. That being said, if everyone wore a mask, no aerosol droplets would be in the air and therefore, EVEN WITH A WET MASK, you would not get the virus. We need to protect each other, we are all Americans and we are all humans.</p>
