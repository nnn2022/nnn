        <p>Some of us lived through 9/11 &amp; remember when we were told that the patriot act was temporary, that taking off our shoes in security was temporary, that the existence of TSA was temporary. When you live through 19 years of “temporary massive changes”, it’s very easy to be skeptical that all of this will also be temporary. </p>
<p>While I don’t believe they can permanently stop things like festivals and concerts and full stands at sporting events, it’s important to make sure that the powers that be understand we aren’t going to let them slowly make this permanent like they did with 9/11 security theater. While that was relatively sustainable, none of this should be in anyone’s mouth as being “new long term normal”. It should be referred to as “temporary abnormal so we get through this” but it’s not. It’s repeatedly being framed as “never going back to normal” and I cannot accept that.</p>
<p>So yeah man I hope you’re right! I hope this all goes away with a vaccine but I’ll be damned sure I stay loud so it says that way: temporary.</p>

        <p>I sort of agree with you? I might be getting the meaning wrong, but it’s temporary, but people initially thought it was going to stay around forever, like flu season. And the precautions that followed 9/11 are justified; they help prevent atrocious acts like 9/11. It’s there so it doesn’t happen again. So if we wear a mask and follow the rules, we can prevent coronavirus and get closer to ending quarantine</p>

        <p>So if it takes ten years for the vaccine to come out (which is the <strong>actual norm</strong> for vaccines to be created, tested, and distributed, the current vaccines are being rushed as hell), we should wear masks for 10 years?</p>

        <p>If countries can get it under control, then no we won’t have to wear a mask. But saying no more masks and September 15; burn the masks won’t help. So if we all do our part in putting on a mask, it will end quicker. And anyway, you only have to wear it outside, how hard can it be</p>

        <p>But people are following them, and have been for months.</p>
<p>Just so you know, you have fallen for a classic con job called a rain maker. It's when a man comes to a village and promises the people if they do "insert unquantifiable requirement", rain will come. When the rain comes (which eventually will happen), he can take credit. If the rain does not come, he can just say the people didn't perform the requirement good enough, and they need to do it harder or better. But in the end, the people were deceived and manipulated. Masks are a textbook example of a rain maker con. You were sold the idea that masks would slow the spread of the virus. After months, when that promise did not come true, the excuse is of course that people must not wearing masks enough. So instead of logically realizing that you have been played, you are desperately clinging onto an obvious lie. All the data we have shows that masks make no difference, but it doesn't matter to you.</p>

        <p>What could they gain from a rainmaker? Wearing a mask to what help an election or control the people? I just want people to wear a mask and it’s not working because people aren’t wearing masks.

        <p>Compliance. Division. Subtle obedience conditioning. Dehumanization. Power. Marking tribalism. Virtue signaling. Governments want to look like they are "doing something" and "taking it seriously", without having to lock down again. </p>
<p>In what world are people not wearing masks? Good grief. There isn't a store in the country that doesn't require masks to enter. Sure, a handful of people choose to not comply, but this is a tiny number of people. Do you honestly think that one guy at walmart without a mask is what is causing the virus to spread? Your idea of people just not wearing masks is simply ridiculous. It doesn't match up with reality. You are just twisting yourself into knots trying to explain why masks have not shown to be effective, and are unwilling to admit that you have been deceived. It's sad.</p>

        <p>If something requires the general public to be 100% compliant for it to work, it's a bad policy, because you're never going to get 100% compliance. There are always going to be people who won't do it, people who can't do it, and people who forget to do it. It's not a viable strategy even if it works in the magical fairyland of flawless, consistent compliance.</p>
<p>You could theoretically eradicate all curable STIs by forbidding people to have sex, testing everyone, and treating infections until they're completely gone. Nobody tries to implement that because compliance rate won't be very high and it's a violation of personal liberty - even though "no sex" is much less burdensome than COVID restrictions and doesn't impact jobs or friendships.</p>

        <p>It's already over. Deaths and hospitalizations are low and decreasing almost everywhere. Cases are irrelevant - and miscounted, since for every other disease, a "case" requires both a diagnosis and symptoms that bring the person into medical care. That's why, for instance, the CFR of influenza is higher than the estimated IFR; most flu infections are not severe enough for the person to go to the doctor and the infection isn't confirmed. There are many more infections than cases. COVID-19 is the exception where someone entirely asymptomatic, and possibly a false positive, gets listed as a case.</p>

        <p>Would you like to take chances? If it’s truly a mistake, people should still quarantine, because even if they don’t have it, are asymtomatic (spelt wrong sorry), or have a different disease, people can catch it or worse spread it to others.

        <p>Yes, I'd rather take my chances on this one. Lockdowns / mass quarantines are not a minor inconvenience. They hurt people's mental health, increase substance abuse, provide extra triggers for domestic violence and child abuse with fewer opportunities to detect it, erode social relationships, restrict opportunities for exercise, and plunge people into joblessness and poverty. All that <em>public health</em> damage for a virus that's on its way out and poses little threat to most people.</p>
<p>Not to mention that preventing young, healthy people from catching it just makes it take longer to get to herd immunity. A voluntary lockdown for seniors and the chronically ill, with a little financial assistance to help them with associated costs (delivery fees, equipment for sick people who need online devices to work from home, etc.), would have been much more helpful. Those that want to stay isolated can, those who really don't want to don't have to, and those of us who are younger and healthier get to herd immunity faster so the old and sick are better protected.</p>

        <p>Why would you dub something the new normal if you didn’t expect it to last?  Normal is defined as “the usual, average, or typical state or condition”.

        <p>Google any state followed by “new normal”. Virtually every state has a fundamental change to the way society functions. Just like the Patriot Act after 9/11, the politicians will never let a good crisis go to waste. New regulations, controls and mandates will continue to be in place long after the virus is “contained”. That’s what No New Normal is about. It’s about not letting the camel get its nose under the tent. Not allowing the Federal or Local governments put “temporary” measures in place. There isn’t a single government in history that hasn’t taken advantage of its populace when given the opportunity. Unfortunately the US is no different.</p>

        <p>Why are you so confident that "they" will find a vaccine? We've been studying coronaviruses for decades with no luck, why are you banking on the fact that they will figure it out now?</p>
<p>Major consequences? Like what? Who gets punished? Scientists for not being smart enough to pull a perfectly timed vaccine out of their asses? Who determines the punishment? </p>
<p>Why should I wear a mask? After months of them being mandated in countless places throughout the world, they have not proven to have any impact on the spread of covid. They did not have any impact in California, Texas Florida, New York, Michigan, Washington, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maryland, Virginia, Hawaii, Spain, Belgium, France, Netherlands, UK, Peru, Argentina, The Philippines, and pretty much any other place where implemented. So why should I wear a mask? What are you thinking it will accomplish? </p>
<p>How long should I wait? Til the end of the year? Next summer? 5 years? Indefinitely? You really think we should all just wait until a vaccine is developed? Even when it's more likely that a vaccine will never be found? What if a vaccine is found an it's only 5% effective? Or it's very effective, but causes blindness in 5% of the people who take it. Or it is a shot that I have to take everyday? Or it ends up being ridiculously expensive? </p>
<p>Your hopes on a vaccine ending all this is extremely unrealistic and irrational.</p>

        <p>I believe they’re gonna make a vaccine because they are prioritizing coronavirus. Before the rise of corona, doctors prioritized viruses that killed more people. Now that lockdown has happened, doctors have to find one, since it is now their main focus</p>

        <p>I trust trained medical professionals. They have saved lives, and created vaccines for diseases that people thought were gonna be around forever. So I have faith</p>

        <p>Yes. You have faith. And that is great...for you. The fact that you want to impose your faith on others is where people take exception. You are free to exercise your faith and wear as many masks as your heart desires, for how ever long you want. No one is stopping you from doing this. Just leave me out of your religion. I don't share your faith and do not want to be a part of it. I have read the literature, and seen the results, and I am not converted.</p>
