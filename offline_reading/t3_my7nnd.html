        <p>nobody lived into their damn 20s. It's just that the average lifespan overall was significantly shorter, specifically because the infant mortality rate was much higher, which dramatically skewed the average. Go educate yourself</p>

        <p>Trying to assure everyone survives is just as ignorant. You have to accept that not everyone will, death will never change. Life sucks, regardless the era. The longer humans survived, the more we learned. The more we learned, the better off we became. Our lives are leagues better than our ancestors will ever be. Assuming greed doesn't destroy the human race, our distant relatives will be much better off than now.</p>

<p>LOL.  Are you listening to yourself?  Are you really trying to make the point that we shouldn't be trying to save lives?</p>
<p>I mean....so you oppose seat belts because not everyone will survive, right?  You must also oppose safety checks on aircraft before flight because hey, everyone dies sometime right?  I mean....why have any medicine or safety precautions at all when trying to assure that people survive dangerous situations is futile because people die anyway?</p>
<p>This the single dumbest argument I've ever heard, and I spent years arguing with the Flat Earthers.</p>

        <p>We also lost way more people to plagues. We started seeing less deaths around the time we started to wear masks around infected during the hight of tuberculosis issues. Actually most people in 1917 were calling for mass arrest of people who think like you so be lucky we even let you people walk the streets.</p>

        <p>Well that's not an accurate depiction of peasant diets in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Meat was a relatively rare treat (maybe a couple times a week), but vegetables were particularly common during parts of the year, and pickled and other stored vegetables were available even during the winter.</p>
<p>Plus it's not like Europe is particularly cold. Palm trees grow in London outside (I've seen them with my own eyes). They're not native, of course, but it's just not that cold.</p>

        <p>Meat was too expensive for the masses, the black death was airborne plumbing wouldn’t have mattered. Our diets today are not much healthier and are in fact less healthy do to all the greases and sugars, you can buy healthy stuff but majority of the population cannot afford it, thus we have weight issues and health problems related to food en masse.</p>

        <p>Health food being not affordable is a myth, as well, for the odd things that are that is both A) marketing (aka it doesn’t need to be that expensive) and B) supply and demand. People don’t want health, they want taste. Keep buying McDonald’s, and you’ll get what we currently have, 30 nuggets for 8$</p>
<p>Veganism is making healthy food much more affordable than it already is. </p>
<p>FYI, you don’t need your stomach “filled” after eating. Feeling full is an indication you’re at your limit, or even over it. This leads to weight gain. You can eat a salad and not be full, but have many nutrients vitamins and calories to help you keep going through the day. Not every meal should be a salad just saying you can delegate protein to only some meals. </p>
<p>When you eat fat and protein for breakfast lunch and dinner and all you do is work in an office, stay at home, go to school, when you aren’t even getting out much that’s really dumb. </p>
<p>The hunter gathers who are high calorie diets did so because they were nomads always on the move. People today try to justify this diet while spending 5 hours on Netflix, 10 sleeps, and the rest sitting around at work, in their car, bus, or shitting. </p>
<p>Our diets today aren’t healthier by default, what I’m saying is they can be. If they were we wouldn’t be in this pandemic. We would have survived many more illnesses over history if we ditched meat for veggies</p>

        <p>No they did not. The plague came back every decade and killed 20% of London.</p>
<p>A series of major resurgent epidemics occurred in the late 17th century, and the disease recurred in some places until the late 18th century or the early 19th century. After this, a new strain of the bacterium gave rise to the third plague pandemic which started in Asia around the mid-19th century.</p>

        <p>No. Because the seasonal flu and other common virus’ are just a part of daily life and have been for a very, very long time. Masks are meant for everyone to wear during a pandemic because it’s not your usual virus’ going around- not to mention Covid is many times deadlier than the flu (which isn’t all that deadly)</p>

<p>a little fun fact for you: the flu deaths and infections went down significantly after people started wearing masks, so if you really don’t think it works for covid then... we’ll ur a lost cause.</p>

        <p>flu deaths "went down" because every symptom that can possibly be interpreted as COVID is being labeled as COVID now, including flu symptoms. That's what happens if you financially reward medical practitioners for making certain diagnoses.</p>
<p>also, I personally never saw anyone wearing a mask prior to COVID, immunocompromised or not, but if I did, that person is an idiot, because all the research prior to 2020 showed that masks were useless. We learned this in the early 2000s from studying SARS exhaustively. Maybe you could go learn it too</p>

        <p>That’s just not true. They determine it’s covid if it doesn’t match most of the symptoms of another virus, for example, let’s just say the flu had 7 symptoms, and a person was experiencing 5/7 they would treat it as a flu, but if it has 4/7 they would either test or determine covid. </p>
<p>My guy how are masks not effective please tell me, I have gotten sick almost every summer and winter yet for some reason the year I decided to wear a mask I don’t get sick at all. Yes the blue surgeon masks are really not all that effective but the triple filter masks work perfectly it’s small enough for air to pass through, but not viruses</p>

        <p>lmao. I'm sorry, but you're legit brainwashed bro. There is literally nobody claiming a mask will protect you from having viral infection transmitted to you. That's completely unscientific and nobody even claims it. Imagine if all throughout human history, all a person had to do was wear a mask to prevent becoming sick! That's completely absurd! Why would we even need doctors, or medicine, or vaccines? It's ridiculous! I'm sorry, but that's not even a thing. You are confused. Some people claim that wearing the mask reduces the wearer's viral transmission to other people, but even this reduction is very small, as shown by many studies prior to 2020. However, nobody in any position of expertise is even claiming that wearing a mask will actually stop you from getting sick. This is sheer misunderstanding on your part and is supported by absolutely nothing.</p>

        <p>are you actually trolling, or not. It's very difficult to even tell. But what I can tell for sure is this. Plague doctors wore masks so they could hold herbs inside the masks and keep the herbs strapped to their faces. They believed that smelling the herbs kept them from becoming sick. Why don't you go research the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory">miasma theory of disease</a> and get back to me about this.</p>

        <p>That's <strong>per day</strong>, not total.</p>
<p>From the linked article discussing this paper:</p>
<p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778233</p>
<p>&rt; Because the percentage point decreases (for mask mandates) and increases (for on-premises dining) refer to changes in daily growth rates, <strong>changes over time amplify exponentially</strong> and these measures could result in averting a substantial number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. An earlier study that examined mask mandates in 15 states and the District of Columbia between April 8 and May 15, 2020, estimated that reductions in daily case growth rates of the same magnitude were associated with more than 200 000 COVID-19 cases averted</p>

        <p>I would love to actually see that source, because I’d imagine it says they work to a certain percentage like it has been said for the past year... I understand it effects the economy but it’s not in a “oh my god we’re going into a depression” it was a couple of weeks we can deal with that because... capitalism. I also find it ironic you care about suicide deaths, people who chose to take their lives, but ur perfectly fine with taking other people’s lives because covid doesn’t affect you personally. Have you thought maybe it’s a 1.8% decrease because of the people pretending it doesn’t exist or thinking oh I have my vaccine since I’m safe fuck everyone else who doesn’t have it... you know people who didn’t have the common sense to pass 5 grade science.</p>

<p>&rt; Mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease (p = 0.02) in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 1–20 days after implementation and decreases of 1.1, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.8 percentage points 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days, respectively, after implementation</p>
<p>Funny that you have no empathy for people who commit suicide because of the lockdowns. State-enforced depression is okay but people getting sick, which has happened for millennia, isn’t. And no I haven’t considered that it’s “only a 1.8% decrease because of the people pretending it doesn’t exist.” It’s a 1.8% decrease because cotton masks are actively worse than no masks, surgical masks only help for so long, and we’ve known that for years. Yet the CDC still recommends cotton masks and doesn’t emphasize replacing dirty used masks. Funny how we’re supposed to follow the science and yet all the science is contradictory to what’s happening and being enforced.</p>

        <p>You realize that daily case growth rate is percent per day right? So 1.8% per day over 30 days is a 54% reduction... looks like masks work pretty well to me.</p>

        <p>hijacking the top comment to actually answer the question:</p>
<p>it's because unlike common cold, tuberculosis, etc. COVID is more common at the moment and has a higher mortality rate. Furthermore, all the illnesses listed have been studied and understood by scientists far better than COVID and moreover, treatments and medication for the illnesses listed have been developed years ago and have been proven and tested countless times. To add to this, diseases such as tuberculosis are much more prevalent in third-world and developing countries, unlike COVID which is a pandemic (by definition, a global problem). You state a false equivalence between these diseases and COVID because even though they are respiratory illnesses that spread through the air, there are key differences in terms of prevalence, burden, and medical treatments.</p>
<p>Hope this answers your question!</p>
<p>also instead of just downvoting, you could argue against what i said. I'd love to be proven wrong. doesn't the description of the subreddit say to discuss?</p>

        <p>I will both downvote and reply.</p>
<p>The picture clearly says “if you have never WORN a mask for:” </p>
<p>Worn[past tense] - did we wear masks en-mass for when those ailments were relevant? Did we shut down the entire economy? Did we force a “new normal” for how we live as humans? Was there massive political heat that literally risked your political seat of power depending on how you handle the issue? Was there laws being enforced to prevent people from spreading those things? </p>
<p>Doctors and scientists NOW know how to handle the things listed, but what about at the time? Obviously they didn’t. </p>
<p>Covid, by itself doesn’t actually have a higher mortality rate, because it is rarely solely covid that kills someone. It’s like saying driving at 200mph is what kills you, no, it’s the crashing that does. People today that have diabetes, cancer, strokes, all these sick people who are basically already dead without the medical system who get covid, their bodies just can’t handle it at all. It’s the final nail in the coffin so to speak. So you can’t say covid itself is the deadly killer virus. It’s not killing 3 million people who have no medical history of issues, it’s not killing 3 million teens, athletes, nutritionists. It’s killing the weak, who by my eyes were already on death row medically speaking. I wish greatly that they chose options in life that improved their health so they weren’t at this state, I don’t wish for them to die. That said, I also don’t wish to reshape society to fit the needs of these weak people who’s poor life choices lead them to dying of covid. This covid pandemic is a prime example of “a few stupid people ruining it for us all”</p>
<p>Because 3 million compared to 8 billion is only a few people to be clear</p>

<p>Do you not understand the value of a human life? Do you not have a friend or family member who has ever been seriously ill? I guarantee you have or will; someday illness will likely affect you, regardless of your choices.</p>
<p>And to say these conditions are “preventable” or  due to “poor life choices” when you yourself put cancer on the list of conditions associated with Covid deaths? You think people with childhood leukemia, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer are “the weak” and are to blame for their own deaths? Or people with genetic immunodeficiencies, type 1 diabetes, or COPD should just have made different choices? Is aging preventable in your mind? Do you think people over 75 should just do the world a favor and die? I won’t even bother trying to convince you that because a person doesn’t exercise or eat the healthiest doesn’t mean they don’t have value or try to remind you that unhealthy people have contributed to music, art, science, politics, medicine, and anything else you care about. </p>
<p>There are people on this sub who want to debate policy choices and who truly want what they believe is best for their fellow man. I often don’t agree with them, and that’s ok. But that there are also people here who think like this is truly sad. “A few stupid people ruining it for us all” you might say.</p>

        <p>So wishing for people to lead lives that don’t result in them dying because of poor health, is disgusting? That’s some grade-a stupidity.</p>
<p>Oh great, let’s talk about the value of human life now 😂</p>
<p>Shall we set free all the prisoners who have commit crimes? It is that we consider their crimes to be in opposition to human life, thereby not valuing it, that we set them as prisoners. But for you, why not consider that these prisoners are still human and should be valued and set free allowed to live normal lives. </p>
<p>Why do we deem some things inhuman? Why is it inhuman to torture another human being by starving them, sexually abusing them, locking them in a room. But if you do these same things to yourself it is not an inhuman act? Why isn’t it inhuman to consume foods and beverage that poison your health? Why isn’t it inhuman to value social media over socializing? Why isn’t it inhuman to care so little about your life that you’d fund companies that in turn, only want to profit off your suffering, health complications and misery? </p>
<p>People can, and have died purely of old age. The death that’s peaceful as you just die in your sleep kind of thing. I wasn’t born into a society that cared about health, so the many years of my younger life when I wasn’t aware of these things may have done irreparable damage to my long term health. So it may be that I succumb to illness, that does not mean I will not take steps right now until the end to mitigate that. I know exactly where in my life I was not acting on behalf of my long term health, and so I will take ownership of this and not expect anyone’s pity when I meet my end days. </p>
<p>Never did I talk about people born with illnesses, if it is their fate to be blighted by a worsen condition than most, that’s not something I wish upon them, or anyone. The remaining factor is what I can do about it. Nothing. Their fate is sealed. If medicine can’t help them, then I can’t help them. If it was my life goal to take on the problem of everyone affected by medical issues, it wouldn’t wouldn’t allow me to actually make a difference. Again, some people born with issues have a family history of these health problems. If you know you have a history of something in your family, and you make the conscious choice to have a child, that is a choice you’re making to put the child at risk. It’s a choice, none the less. Nobody is forcing you to have kids, eat McDonald’s, smoke cigarettes, drink beer, these are all choices. If they lead to one life being comprised that isn’t on me. </p>
<p>You misunderstand. Weakened people do have value, but their value doesn’t supersede the values of those who arent. </p>
<p>Right now the agenda is to have the 99% conform to a new normal, just to protect these weaker people at risk of covid. The 1%. </p>
<p>Out of these 1% of people, what number percentage would you attribute to those who were born with alignments? Do you even have one such number? The fact remains it’s still a vast minority of people who will die of covid, and it sucks for them. It doesn’t suck for me, and I’m not going to let the government and medical tyrants try to tell me it does</p>

        <p>About 50% of this response including the references to criminals and inhumane treatment seems like utter nonsense that has absolutely no relation to anything I said but let me try to address some of the rest. </p>
<p>You say it is people’s fate to be blighted by conditions they are born with and that “the remaining factor is what I can do about. Nothing. Their fate is sealed.” But that’s not even remotely true. People with some of the conditions you initially listed can live long healthy lives and are not doomed to die young and there are many things you could do to help people with these conditions. For example, wearing a mask and being vaccinated for preventable diseases helps keep immunocompromised people (whose immune systems aren’t strong enough to receive a vaccine) not get these illnesses and then die. You talk a lot about how you “take responsibility” while others don’t, and yet you’re shrugging off any moral responsibility to your fellow man by lying to yourself that without dedicating your life to medicine there’s nothing you can do to help people born with illnesses when there are many easy and obvious ways you can help.</p>
<p>Secondly, choosing to have a child with possible genetic issues is a choice, I suppose, but not a choice made by the child. Logically it makes absolutely no sense to act as if having a genetic condition the predisposes you to covid or other diseases is a result of any of your own choices, and I think you know that.</p>
<p>Next you’re using a utilitarian argument to fight back against covid precautions but you’re using it incorrectly. Let’s ignore the actual numbers of people who have died or who have irreversibly damaged lung function because of covid and go with your 99%-1% argument. If 99% of people had to die to save 1% from dying that would be a perfect example of the needs of the few superseding the needs of the many. But if 99% have to wear a little cloth mask, get a free shot that will also help them avoid getting sick, and go without restaurant food for a couple months to save the 1% from dying, then the needs of the few TO LIVE far exceed the “wants” of the 99% to avoid slight inconveniences to themselves. </p>
<p>Lastly, I would just like to state again that your belief that people have complete control over their health and if they just made different choices they wouldn’t be susceptible to disease goes against modern medicine and really all medical evidence in the past several decades. But I’m less concerned about your complete lack of medical and scientific knowledge and more concerned with your incredible selfishness when it comes to human life. </p>
<p>“It’s still a vast minority of people who will die from covid and it sucks for them. It doesn’t suck for me.”</p>
<p>Do you not know anyone who lost a relative during this pandemic? Or a spouse? Or a child? Because you should be able to understand that “that sucks for them” is a callous and thoughtless response without the need for a personal connection, but you seem like someone who needs something bad to directly impact their own life before they care or humanize the people around them. I never said wishing people didn’t leave unhealthy lives was disgusting, that’s just a strawman and you know that isn’t remotely like what I said. But the way you discuss human lives as if they are simply inconveniences in your own story is without a doubt the most disgusting thing I’ve seen in a very long time. I truly hope no one in your life contracts a serious illness of any kind such as any type of cancer, hypertension, hypothyroidism, heart disease, or even ages above 75 in good health, because it sounds like you will offer nothing but scorn and blame regardless of the cause of their condition and will intentionally expose them to disease in order to avoid even the slightest inconvenience to yourself.</p>

        <p>It’s not my moral responsibility, again, because those that are at risk SHOULD TAKE STEPS to not be. </p>
<p>The simple truth is that INSTEAD of locking down the planet for those at risk, THOSE AT RISK should be locked down in a medical facility until covid is gone. It would have severely reduced death tolls, because only health people would be out and about, making the economy flow, which in turn would provide resources for the at risk to continue to be protected in care facilities, or even their own damn house. Like you realize you can just order food now a days? If you’re sick or have immune comprise, take the benefit relieve payment, and stay home. SIMPLE right? There would be no at risk people for me to worry about, if AGAIN the at risk people chose to not be at risk. </p>
<p>“What about spreading it through other people to them?” OK and again, it’s the responsibility of the final person in that chain who is going to visit an at risk person, to fully sanitize and be hygienic before seeing this at risk person. And if that person doesn’t know, ITS THE AT RISK PERSONS responsibility to inform others. </p>
<p>You had to have seen the videos of some lady in a grocery store yelling at people “I’m immune comprised, so put on your masks everyone”. If you’re immune comprised in a pandemic and you go to the most highly populated areas in society you’re a moron, plain and simple. </p>
<p>Guess what? I’ve gone exactly 27 years without getting covid (Corona virus in humans first emerged in 1960s), Including these past years with no vaccine, and only a mask to get grocery store items because I don’t feel like the hassle of arguing with staff. I don’t actually need the mask, or the vaccine. Neither will prevent me from getting sick, because my body already does that on its own. </p>
<p>No, I’ll reiterate. Nobody in my immediate or extended family, family friends, friends, coworkers, customers, fellow employees, pets, people I play online video games with, none have died of covid. One claims to have gotten it, and it literally only stopped them for the same amount of time as a normal flu might. So that’s hardly worth even being afraid of. </p>
<p>Obviously people have died over the years in my life, and the truth that I observed is that it was their lack of responsibility with their health. So, why am I going to waste emotional energy on those who are even close to me, and concern for their life when THEY themselves don’t even regard their own life enough to prioritize health?? It’s like buying a pet who you already know has a life threatening disease. They gonna die soon so why feel bad? It’s too late for them. </p>
<p>My emotional concern is to the future generation being poisoned by literally bad dietary choices, misinformation, biased tradition. </p>
<p>I feel remorse for the next spawn of humans that will have so many uphill battles to fight because they aren’t being given a proper life. Outdoors, adventure, exercise is being replaced by Uber eats, iPads, YouTube clickbait. </p>
<p>Learning to cook is being replaced by ordering online anything from any culture.  </p>
<p>You made a point earlier that seemed to indicate I fall into the category of people that don’t want to wear a mask just to go back to normal of dining into restaurants, but I don’t. I cook whatever I want for myself because it’s a skill afforded to me, that I both can learn more of and improve upon everyday. Quarantine has made some people get fat, lazy, dependant. I have made the choice to not have this happen. </p>
<p>There is literally a ‘normal’ saying going around of gaining the “quarantine 15”. Like no, you’re staying at home doing absolutely nothing, you shouldn’t be gaining weight you should be losing weight by eating less, because you don’t actually need to eat that much calories for not doing anything. </p>
<p>What’s apparent is most of these people are stress eating because all the inhuman conduct of transforming society is stressful to people. </p>
<p>Wearing a mask isn’t merely an inconvenience. </p>
<p>First of all, the majority of these cheaply made masks come from China, that have a history of being heavily polluted. Am I going to trust breathing through some cheap fabric everyday for 2 years? No. </p>
<p>Did all these masks pass any regulatory standards before being sold to the world? </p>
<p>Next, for the vaccine, no that’s not just an inconvenience it’s a life choice, it has side effects. Do the side effects outweigh covid? For me yes, because I am not getting covid. Furthermore it doesn’t matter that it’s free. </p>
<p>I’ve literally been offered cocaine at parties, I refused that, for the same reason I do the vaccine. It does not appear to be in benefit of my health, so I refuse. Simple right?</p>

        <p>Your solution of essentially jailing or in your words “locking down” people until covid is over would never work. You’ve deemed all people who don’t cook their own food, aren’t athletic, are over 75, have any genetic health conditions or a predisposition to particular health conditions as unhealthy and at risk of getting covid. That is the vast vast majority of Americans (and Europeans, East Asians, and most other countries in the developed world). I cannot wait to see how you think the economy is going to keep running for you once almost everyone is locked away. The grocery store you go to (since you’re so much better than everyone else because you cook), you think the people who staff it are 100% healthy by your inane standards of food, exercise, and youth? Probably not and even those that are may have a roommate, relative, spouse, or child who isn’t perfectly healthy by your standards and as you said it’s their responsibility to keep them safe right? So almost everyone in the world has a responsibility to stay under lock and key under your system...that’s almost like exactly what we’ve done huh? Crazy. For someone who believes that they are some special exception for being healthy while everyone else makes bad choices, you have a very poor concept of just how many “unhealthy” people make up your economy.</p>
<p>Also I’m not sure how you think covid would’ve just ended if we locked up “the weak” (as you’d call most people). It’s not like a season that just ends. Its a disease. And if all the morons on the outside i.e. you, refuse to get vaccinated and supposedly “can’t get it” then all those inside would immediately begin dying upon leaving their special magic covid free facility. Think about when European settlers showed up in the americas carrying dozens of dangerous viral strains they’d developed resistance to and immediately infected and killed off the majority of the native population with smallpox they often didn’t even know they were carrying. That was great right? Glad you’ve decided we should bring that back purposefully against all modern medical advice. Its narcissistic and idiotic to think you, without any medical training, experience in public policy, or even basic knowledge of modern medicine and hospitals, have come up with a brilliant plan that would’ve saved so many lives, especially when you are primarily motivated by your own convenience. </p>
<p>You live in a false dichotomy where people can either make healthy choices for themselves or try not to infect and negatively impact the health of others when really, good people do both. Future generations learning to cook and “YouTube clickbait” has exactly zero to do with keeping people safe who have covid. You’d think teaching future generations that health is important and that the choices you make impact your health would include teaching them to wear a mask and get a vaccine to protect themselves, but I guess not. People in my family made their own masks, which is something idiots who think masks come from China and are full of pollutants did as well, and then distributed homemade sanitized masks to families in our community to protect themselves and their kids. Who do you think has done more to help future generations and teach them about the importance of choosing healthy behaviors? I’ll give you a hint: it’s not the person sitting on their ass complaining about how they can’t help prevent deaths due to covid because they’re so concerned that their grandkids won’t get to play outside. So let’s just not pretend you care about anyone but yourself. </p>
<p>I’m starting to think it’s useless trying to get someone with so little empathy to care about anyone but themselves, so I’m going to stop. I would advise you to get a vaccine and keep yourself from getting sick but luckily you have the ability to tell the future and know for a fact that you “won’t get covid” because your body apparently possesses a super power that allows you to create antibodies for a strain of a virus that was only observed in humans two years ago (hence Covid-19) and you may never have even been exposed to. I’m glad you weren’t alive during the polio epidemic in the US because you’d be yelling about side effects and the dangers of TV on some street corner while hobbling around on your polio stricken legs.</p>

        <p>No, the virus affects under 1% of people. Lock them down in special facilities or their house. If they are at risk they need to take precautions. If you are immune comprised stay home, and the government should give you relief aid so you can still get by. The 99% are not sick. Locking down them ruins the economy and public health because stress, depriving them of activity, and other key human traits. </p>
<p>That’s why suicide rate has gone up since covid marshal law has been enforced.</p>
<p>IF you’re immune compromised, and you live with people it’s THIER responsibility to wear a mask around the weakened person who’s at home, it’s THEIR responsibly to wash their hands and keep their distance while at home. </p>
<p>It’s really astonishing that me mentioning basic known ways of improving health to you are inane. It sounds like your being defensive. </p>
<p>I’m not better than others because I cook, I’m better than myself. My past self who didn’t adhere to health choices. </p>
<p>If me explaining how ive improved my life with health and wellness practices offends you, that’s on you. </p>
<p>It’s pretty simple: those who are weak who need to be isolated, shall WAIT in that state until THEY get the vaccine, to which then they can leave their house or the facility. </p>
<p>You are one of the idiot pro-vaxxers who thinks this is about convenience for me, no. NOT TAKING EXPERIMENTAL CHEMICAL INJECTION is not an inconvenience you buffoon. </p>
<p>Are you dumb? Most made in China stuff is made with the cheapest of materials. Chinas factory region literally was classified by environmental agencies to be inhospitable to human life because the air quality was so bad. These are the areas making your holy mask. </p>
<p>Making cloth makes at home doesn’t stop covid. That’s idiotic. That why you don’t see doctors wearing custom mask while doing surgeries. You wear your custom cloth mask with some logo or catch phrase on the front to act like you’re some superhero and it’s a pathetic complex that needs to be addressed by psychologists.</p>

        <p>The original strain is 80% that of the original Sars virus of 2003. We effectively had 18 years to produce a vaccine that could competently fight the original strain and all variants. Why not use that to our advantage? I am positive someone has started working on one since the virus was first found. </p>
<p>Now we are using what appears the first mRNA vaccine ever to test a vaccine on the populace at large.</p>

        <p>We did use our knowledge of previous SARS and MERS outbreaks to our advantage: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7177048/</p>
<p>However, vaccines for those are not commercially available.</p>
<p>It's important to consider that in developing this vaccine, there are factors that differentiate it from many other diseases and attempts to create vaccines.</p>

        <p>We’ve always worn N95 respirators or PAPRs when dealing with TB. We do mask fittings annually just in case we encounter a patient with TB. Patients infected with TB are required to wear a surgical mask. You do see a lot of mask wearing in places where TB is endemic, especially in Asia. We have not needed to lock down for TB because it is only endemic in a few places in the world and it is relatively contained thanks to the BCG vaccine for TB and treatment with antibiotics. </p>
<p>This is the first time in a hundred years we’ve seen mask wearing on such a global scale and what we are seeing is confirmation that masks actually work, especially given that TB can be spread asymptomatically. We’ve known for a while that surgical masks work well to contain droplets, which is why we have patients wear them when sick.</p>

        <p>Maybe try reading your own link? Let me help you.</p>
<p>TB rates <em>have</em> dropped significantly. Part of it is due to a reduction in diagnoses:</p>
<p>&rt;    In India, home to about 27 percent of the world’s TB cases, diagnoses have dropped by nearly 75 percent since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>&rt;    In country after country, the pandemic has resulted in sharp drops in diagnoses of TB: a 70 percent decline in Indonesia, 50 percent in Mozambique and South Africa, and 20 percent in China, according to the W.H.O.</p>
<p>The problem this article actually raises is the interruption in treatment programs due to the pandemic. There is concern it could lead to antibiotic resistance. </p>
<p>&rt;    Interruptions or delays in treatment may lead to drug resistance, already a formidable problem in many countries.</p>
<p>There is also some concern that people with TB could be spreading it to others sharing a living space with them because people don’t socially distance or wear masks at home, and won’t wear masks when things return to normal:</p>
<p>&rt;    Each person with TB can spread the disease to another 15 individuals over a year, sharply raising the possibility of <strong>people infected while indoors spreading it among their communities once lockdowns end.</strong></p>
<p>So that is the basis for one estimate that suggests TB cases <em>could</em> rise in the future:</p>
<p>&rt;    According to one estimate, a three-month lockdown across different parts of the world and a gradual return to normal over 10 months could result in an additional 6.3 million cases of tuberculosis and 1.4 million deaths from it.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

        <p>TB is a respiratory illness, it's not  a virus but it impacts at risk individuals the same as any respiratory virus would. It is especially dangerous forb individuals with weakened immune systems, and TB resists the drugs used to treat it, so it takes months of many different medications to get rid of the infection.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, TB is a serious public health threat that needs to be taken seriously. </p>
<p>But the reality is that the nature of the threat it poses is different than respiratory viruses, due to the slow nature of it’s transmission. It’s not a good example to minimize COVID-19.</p>

<p>Like, consider that the US has had very low rates of TB despite having not widely used a vaccine against it and being a significant issue around the world. It just doesn’t transmit nearly as easily.</p>

        <p>Monitoring is part of it, as is treatment, but the reality is that TB just doesn’t spread like respiratory viruses do. </p>
<p>Here’s something worth considering. Even if someone who’s infected with TB becomes contagious (and 90% don’t), the fastest that can possibly happen is 3-4 weeks, and often happens much later. That really slows down it’s transmissibility and outbreak potential. Compare that to respiratory viruses, which can be contagious in a matter of days.</p>

        <p>While I can't get into the mind of a psychopath to know the exact answer, my personal reasoning is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The means of control (digital surveillance) are now for the first time in human history fully scaled to the point where digital currency, chips, nano-cameras, drones, etc. are produced cheaply enough to be mass manufactured and implemented globally.</li>
<li>Same point as above can be made about mRNA or gene editing technology (which is in the gene therapy shots they are trying like all hell to pass off as "vaccines" even though none meet the historical definition of a vaccine, which traditionally contain weakened or killed forms of the microbe or its toxins...."Sars-Cov-2" has never been isolated and purified so they don't have this...but I digress).</li>
<li>They know the Grand Solar Minimum is fast approaching. There is something to their climate change alarmism, except its not getting warmer, its getting cooler with a <a href="https://earth-chronicles.com/natural-catastrophe/earth-is-about-to-enter-a-mini-ice-age-expert-warns.html">mini ice age expected by some researchers</a> starting in 2030. Hence all the new farming regulations in the pipeline across the world and <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/02/27/why-bill-gates-is-now-the-us-biggest-farmland-owner/">billionaires</a> buying up farm land now. They want to come out of this unscathed and on top with more wealth, power and control than any totalitarian regime ever before in history.</li>
<li>They've learned from past attempts (Marx communism, National Socialism ala Germany and World Wars) that the path of least resistance is one where people cull themselves willingly rather than fighting them tooth and nail every step of the way...how many people are willingly going along with the current plandemic out of sheer fear and carrot and stick (answer: the majority), all without a single shot being fired...yet.</li>
<li>They realize that more and more people are waking up to their nefarious agenda by the day thanks to the Internet and mobile apps, with dissemination of information never being quicker or easier on a near global scale. Not to mention anti-globalism, sovereign minded, freedom loving local and national politicians gaining genuine organic, grassroots support...they know their jig is almost up.</li>
<li>(bonus) Their fiat currency ponzi scheme is coming to an end (all fiat currencies backed by nothing other than "good faith" have had a shelf life of 50-60 years tops). It's been exactly 50 years since Nixon took the USD (global reserve currency) off the gold standard in 1971. With debt-fueled growth all but non-existent now and larger and larger quantities of fiat currency needing to be regularly pumped into the system (bailouts, quantitative easing, open-market operations) just to keep it afloat, the days of the fiat dollar are numbered and the house of cards is going to come tumbling down within the next 5-10 years no matter what they do. They are getting ahead of this with a controlled collapse, so they can deflect blame onto an imaginary "pandemic" they created and <em>problem-reaction-solution</em> the uneducated masses into their digital dollar with total oversight and control of every transaction you make.</li>

<p>Put all this together and its the perfect time. I sure as shit hope I'm wrong, but like an old saying goes: Hope for the best and try your damnedest to make it happen, but plan for the worst.</p>

        <p>Sunlight and fresh air are great for the immune system... but going outside during a pandemic might get you infected soo you should probably stay in if it isn’t necessary </p>
<p>Oxygen is the very basis of all life... and it’s has been proven and proven again that wearing a mask does not restrict your oxygen levels... if this was the case then surgeons would probably use something else to cover their faces while operating for hours and hours when they have to perform to the best of their abilities </p>
<p>Healthy relationships with friends and family are great for mental health... but maybe instead of meeting those people in person during a pandemic you could restrict yourself to phonecalls or videochats</p>

        <p>Right. Somehow I remembered reading 2B total covid cases so I admit to be wrong on that.</p>
<p>But still, a virus which you have a 98% survival rate and this survival rate comes from a minuscule percentage of people infected, almost a 99.99% chance of not even getting it? Insane.</p>
<p>25k people die because of hunger every single day.</p>

        <p>I respect that in some societies they always weared masks while sick to protect others (Japan for example). It wouldn't be a bad idea honestly. </p>
<p>The stupid part of this whole discussion is comparing wearing a N95 mask VS a cloth unwashed mask and making them mandatory everywhere. The government should offer N95 masks for free when you go to hospital appointments for example, not only for Covid but for all the bugs that you can catch/spread in that enviroment. Including the ones mentioned in this pic.</p>
<p>Now, the whole "wear a cloth mask when you are alone sitting in a bench at the park" is just stupidity.</p>

<p>This might actually happen, policy written in blood and all, so hands being forced tends to lead to long-term improvements like this. </p>
<p>That said, the big risk there is waiting rooms and failure of reception to recognize high-risk symptoms. </p>
<p>But just like doctors smoking while examining you, we only tend to learn when something happens.</p>

        <p>They tested surgical masks long before 2019 to prevent the flue, found it offered little protection, if any. Covid is more contagious than the flue, so the idea that it'll help is laughable.</p>
<p>If masks really helped, they'd demand we wear N95 masks or gas masks, not a piece of cloth or your shirt.</p>
<p>No, this is about conditioning people to be obedient, and to create strife between the masked and the non masked. Divide and conquer 101, people claim they're smart because they went to college, yet they still fall for the oldest tricks in the book.</p>

        <p>For some context, in countries like China, Japan, and in fact much of S. And SE Asia, wearing a mask in public has been seen as a public courtesy for the better part of two decades due to concerns of transmissible diseases in crowded public spaces. The USA and other "Western" countries are just behind the curve. In fact wearing a mask greatly reduces the chances of contracting all of those diseases and not just COVID-19, and we should be doing it more frequently in general especially in urban areas.</p>

        <p>If you lived in Japan, China, or Taiwan before 2002 you may have seen occasional masks but it wasn’t particularly common until after the mass SARS outbreaks there. It’s grown even further in recent years due to worsening environmental conditions in some areas. Here’s a <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/not-just-coronavirus-asians-have-worn-face-masks-decades%3famp">source</a> on that, but I don’t want to tell you what you saw either. Asian consumers purchase and wear millions of masks a year and have for awhile but maybe that doesn’t reflect your personal experience there.🤷‍♀️</p>

        <p>I'm not talking about China or Taiwan, I'm talking about Japan. "Journalists" routinely like to smear all these together, throw out random stats for "east asia" generally and then attempt to make statements about individual places either explicitly or by implication.</p>
<p>That derpy article isn't a source about the claim being made. The most "sourcey" part of it is a claim about the number of masks sold per a month in "East Asia." There are over a billion and a half people who live in "east Asia." Did you even read this article or just googlespam some random shit you think supports your opinion?</p>

        <p>Here’s a quote from that article specifically saying that out of all Asian countries, Japan is one where people often wear masks:</p>
<p>“That’s because Asians, especially in Japan, China and Taiwan, have worn masks for a host of cultural and environmental reasons, including non-medical ones, since at least the 1950s.”</p>
<p>I know that because I read it. Did you? </p>
<p>Here’s a quote from Time magazine:</p>
<p>“Over the next century, a series of major public and global health threats and crises across East Asia, including the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and swine flu in 2009, further cultivated a culture of mask wearing among the general public in Japan. Ultimately, wearing face masks came to symbolise a collective and targeted defence against the invisible threat of pandemics.” </p>
<p>And here’s some more sources:
<a href="https://web-japan.org/trends/11_culture/pop202008_mask-culture.html">Japan’s Ministry of Foreign of Affairs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/06/06/world/asia/japan-coronavirus-masks.amp.html%3f0p19G=6214">NYTimes</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/07/04/national/science-health/japans-history-wearing-masks-coronavirus/">JapanTimes</a></p>
<p><a href="https://gogonihon.com/en/blog/why-do-japanese-people-wear-masks/">Japanese Cultural Blog</a></p>
<p>I fully acknowledge that your personal experience there may have been different, but I’m basing my understanding on reputable evidence and not smearing all East Asians together or “throwing out random stats” so there’s really no need to be rude.</p>

        <p>That’s fine. If you don’t trust Japan’s own ministry of foreign affairs then there’s no convincing you. I just wanted to clarify that I’m not “smearing East Asians together” or providing poor sources. I don’t actually care what you believe about Japanese masking practices 🤷‍♀️</p>

        <p>imo if you have a cough you should be polite and were a mask, ive had bronchitis ALLOT in my life so for years pre covid bs its angered me see'ing people coughing on everything, fkn hate being sick. ontop of that i do think people need to be more responsable as the flu does kill a fair amount of ppl, but that being said this is all clearly just being used as a means to gain power</p>
<p>One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of <strong>power is power</strong>.</p>

        <p>Because most of those infections are extremely uncommon on most of the planet.
Diphtheria and whooping cough vaccines are included in most of the worlds vaccine calendars  ( usually along with tetanus and others on a si for vaccine).</p>
<p>TB has the BCG vaccine which exists for almost a century and helped to drive tb the brink of extinction.</p>
<p>Pneumonia is trickier because is caused by a ton of different bacteria, viruses and fungi. Several vaccines exist that protects us from various pathogens that could cause it.</p>
<p>Influenza is another tricky one since the viruses responsible have shown to be very good at mutating into new strains.</p>
<p>Bronchitis is usually caused by the same viruses that are responsible for influenza, they are not really comparable to the other examples. Same goes for the common cold which is a really ample term that could apply to a ton of pathogens.</p>
<p>TLDR: Most of these diseases have vaccines that have been around for decades and even almost a century, these has helped us control them and fight back. Most 1st world countries have almost wiped out some of this sicknesses.</p>

        <p>There are vaccines for all of these diseases except the common cold and bronchitis. Doctors recommend the influenza vaccine for those susceptible to bronchitis because that is almost always its origin. The common cold isn’t even a disease, just a poorly defined group of self-diagnosed symptoms associated with rhinovirus and influenza.</p>

        <p>That’s very true which is why thousands of people do die from the flu every year. Of course it is far less than the number who have died of Covid in the US. An average flu year in the last decade (with flu vaccinations fairly common) kills 12,000 - 65,000 people whereas Covid-19 has caused 558,000 - 678,000 excess deaths in the last 14 months. Keep in mind that is with major shutdowns, mask mandates, vaccinations, etc. and that is only the EXCESS deaths, so that is only the number who have died beyond the number that would normally die of something else i.e. influenza, heart disease, pneumonia etc. within a given year. So even with the most conservative estimate, Covid has killed about 9.5-10x more people in a year than the flu.</p>
<p>As for why we don’t wear masks to help prevent the 12,000 - 65,000 flu deaths each year, it’s the same reason we drive cars even though car accidents kill millions every year: some combination of being desensitized to these deaths and deciding the consequences are worth the benefits. </p>
<p>Personally I think part of the reason we’d rather let thousands die each year than wear masks is because historically the people dying are primarily elderly, disabled, or otherwise “unhealthy” individuals who we see as less valuable than healthy young people. That’s why diseases that have resulted in mask wearing are ones where (at least initially) they seemed to strike even healthy people, like covid and SARS. People are fairly self-centered and even though I think mask wearing has continued because people do care about the elderly and immunocompromised people (and because unlike the flu, covid is more likely to kill middle aged people and those with more minor and common underlying health conditions) I’m not sure it would’ve started had Covid clearly been a disease of only the elderly and disabled communities from the start. What do you think? Why don’t we wear masks to prevent the flu?</p>

        <p>Because masks cause more issues than they're worth. You should not have to restrict humans only source of oxygen. If you live on this planet you understand that their are diseases and other circumstances that can kill you. It's as simple as that. If you are immunocompromised take care of yourself.</p>

        <p>They wear it to prevent blood and pathogens from the open body getting in their face. I worked for a surgery center for 10 years. They immediately take it off and throw it out. They do not walk around all day in masks. Surgical masks for surgery. That's really it. If these were meant to be worn all day you would have been wearing them all your life.</p>

        <p>&rt;Covid-19 has caused 558,000 - 678,000 excess deaths in the last 14 months.</p>
<p>There is a world of difference between dying "with" covid and "from" covid, and that's ignoring the inaccurate PCR tests.</p>

        <p>Did you ignore the source I shared? The CDC has easily accessible data on how many people have covid listed as the cause of death on their death certificate. Cause of death means they died “from” Covid, to be clear. </p>
<p>Additionally, the reason they also share data about excess deaths (they have data on both of these measures) is because excess deaths is a measure which tries to estimate how many people would’ve died of something else in a normal year and remove those from the number of covid deaths. So, in a hypothetical analogous example, if in a normal year 100 people die (due to any variety of illnesses i.e heart disease, cancer, pneumonia) but then the next year we have a terrible outbreak of polio and 200 people die, even if they all died “with” polio, only 100 would be counted as excess deaths because the others likely would’ve died anyway, whether from polio or something else. Believe it or not you are actually not the first person in the history of medicine to realize people can have a disease and still die from something else, which is why these estimates are reported this way. Excess death estimates don’t really rely heavily on testing anyway, so bringing pcr testing into is just irrelevant. They don’t need to rely heavily on testing because they’re just trying to figure out how many more people died than usual. </p>
<p>I’m curious to hear why you think 558,000 - 678,000 more people in the US died this year than usual? Keeping in mind that more than 500,000 of those people had Covid listed as their cause of death of course.</p>

        <p>People do wear masks in asia to prevent spread of illness. It was pretty common (pre-Covid) to wear masks to protect from smog, prevent transferring illness to others etc. 
Hell, when this whole thing started my local asian grocery was full of people wearing masks (pre mandates). It was like night and day, walking into Walmart after the Asian grocery lol. People looked at me like I was crazy for wearing a mask (and on account of me being halfAsian... I guess)</p>

        <p>No, I think you’ve missed the point. All the other conditions on this list are medically defined diseases with certain characteristic symptoms and a single cause. For example, diphtheria is transmitted by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a bacteria. Even though diphtheria has characteristic symptoms, if you somehow had those symptoms but they were not caused by this bacteria you would not have diphtheria; you would have a different disease with similar symptoms. Because it has a single cause we can (and do) vaccinate against it and it’s likely almost everyone you know has been vaccinated and has not ever had or even met anyone with diphtheria. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the common cold is a term people use to refer to diseases with symptoms like a runny nose, cough, etc. that resolve within ten days. These symptoms can be caused by over 200 strains of viruses some of which are influenza viruses, some of which are rhinoviruses, and some of which are something else entirely. Because of this we “can’t vaccinate against the common cold” because we’ve only developed vaccines for some of these hundreds of viruses. Luckily, “the common cold” is not deadly since its defined as usually resolving in ten days without medical care. If your symptoms get worse, a doctor will identify the cause as one of the actual diseases caused by viruses or bacteria listed above. That’s why you can’t find out “how many people die of a common cold each year?” Because it’s not a clearly defined illness but a multitude of similar illnesses. Instead you can find stats for influenza, pneumonia, specific rhinoviruses etc. Listing it here as if it’s a single preventable cause of death separate from the other diseases on this list is just misleading.</p>

        <p>I very rarely watch TV news.  I have a lot of different sources for news, and assume all news is going to have some bias and sensationalism. I am more interested in what experts say and statistics show, not what a journalist or politician tells me.  I also don't fall for the propaganda that denies the realities of Covid or fearmongers about the vaccines.</p>

<p>No matter where you go for new there will always be a biased opinion, because every news source has an editor. I prefer getting my information directly from scientists, doctors, and text books.</p>
