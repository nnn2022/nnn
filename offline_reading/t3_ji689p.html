    <strong>I have concluded that the "new normal" narrative is an existential threat</strong>
    <p><p>Logic no longer applies to the people advocating for masks and lockdowns.</p>
<p>Without logic, the ability to engage in rational conversation breaks down. We are left in a world being driven by insane policies and unpredictable mood swings of the mainstream media. Never in my life have I felt so ashamed to be part of the human race.</p>
<p>My greatest concern involves the horror of being forced to live in this perpetual new normal limbo.</p></p>

        <p>It has always been an existential threat. The hubris of man thinking that he can outsmart nature while shooting himself in the face is the kind of thing Greek tragedies were written about. The precedent of total lockdown, which was completely beyond the pale this time last year, is set. The decision that democracies have made to allow complete totalitarian rule at the drop of the hat for a threat as minor as covid is a turning point in world history. You would have to go back to Early Modern European monarchies during bubonic plague outbreaks to find anything remotely analogous. And everyone just seems to be accepting it!</p>

        <p>I concluded the same back in April. As far as I can see, there is no future for the human race, the first actually major catastrophe that we need to face will wipe us out, if we can do this much damage to ourselves over a cold.</p>
<p>Or maybe not, if it is all a huge conspiracy maybe they will wipe out all the dumb sheep, leaving only people smart enough to carry on the human race.  An immoral, evil yet maybe required plan.</p>

        <p>An immoral, evil yet maybe required plan... You're insane</p>
<p>Fuck the great reset and the 2030 UN "Sustainable" agenda. It's the devils work. How do you plan to mass murder humans across the world just to keep more finite resources and carbon fuel for the world's rich and privileged.</p>
<p>People's heads in advanced economies are about to pop, whatever rosy notion they had of the world, their filters are about be changed... Never under estimate one's will for survival tho.</p>

        <p>Hey, I didn't disagree with any of that, even said it was evil. I just also think we have a huge proportion of incredibly stupid, useless people, as evidenced by the lack of any resistance to what is going on. Can a population so terminally stupid really have a long term chance at survival? I really don't think so.</p>
<p>I'm under no illusions that if the great reset, fourth industrial resolution, green new deal type stuff is all ushered in, we are looking at a nightmarish vision of the future for 99.99% of the human race, but that leaves the people orchestrating it - and whatever else you might say, that they are evil, psychopaths, satanists or whatever else, one thing you couldn't possibly accuse them of is stupidity.  At the end of the day, if we will all bend over and let this happen, then we just get what we deserved, and we really are just the 'useless eaters' that they think we are.</p>

        <p>these people are drunk with power or have some really nasty ulterior motives.</p>
<p>this is such a toxic situation.</p>
<p>I think with the holidays coming up some people are going to lash out or do something out of desperation and it is going to be ugly.</p>

        <p>The constant censoring of dissent in the medical community is the ultimate red flag in my opinion. My own research on the topics of mortality, transmissions and masking has led me to believe that the new normal is completely unnecessary nonsense. I don't know why these people in charge are doing what they are doing but I agree people are getting tired of it.</p>

<p>Ditto.  I'm hoping there will be small pockets scattered throughout the country where people mostly ignore this "new normal" and go on living the way things were before a virus with a 99.7% survival rate emerged.  I'll definitely be trying to move to one.</p>
