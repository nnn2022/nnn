        <p>&rt;”Yes, there have since been papers saying they’ve produced viral isolates. But there are no controls for them. The CDC produced a paper in July, I think it was, where <strong>they said: ‘Here’s the viral isolate.’ Do you know what they did? They swabbed one person.</strong> One person, who’d been to China and had cold symptoms. One person. <strong>And they assumed he had it to begin with. So it’s all full of holes, the whole thing.”</strong> ^1</p>
<p>&rt;-Dr. Kevin Corbett, P.h.D.</p>
<p><strong>Christian Drosten</strong> created the “Covid” PCR test:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”without having virus material available”</strong> ^1, ^2</p>
<p>&rt;“relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence published on the internet” ^2, ^1</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Dr. Pieter Borger said, ”The virus wasn’t in Europe and the paper was already finished.”</strong> He said these facts “should have been on television long ago. I explained it on LinkedIn, but you get banned if you do.” <strong>Regarding PCR he said, “You are not detecting a virus.”</strong> ^2</p>
<p><strong>So we trust the Chinese scientists that gave Drosten the genetic code, without virus material,  to build the “Covid” PCR test protocol but not trust Chinese scientists that stated there’s ”no “viable virus” in PCR positive cases.”</strong> ^1, ^3</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”German lawyer Reiner Fuellmich</strong>who is central to a growing group of lawyers, scientists, politicians, and even secret pharmaceutical whistleblowers, said in an interview, ”We believe that in order to make this house of cards collapse, we have to attack the PCR test. <strong>The fact is, there are no asymptomatic infections.”</strong> ^1</p>
<p>&rt;This seemingly radical claim was bolstered by a paper out of Wuhan of all places, published by Nature.com, which found no “viable virus” in PCR positive cases.</p>
<p>&rt;”The screening of the 9,865,404 participants without a history of COVID-19 found no newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, and identified 300 asymptomatic positive cases with a detection rate of 0.303 (95 % CI 0.270–0.339)/10,000. … A total of 1174 close contacts of the asymptomatic positive cases were traced, and they all tested negative for the COVID-19. … Of the 34,424 participants with a history of COVID-19, 107 tested positive again, giving a repositive rate of 0.310% (95% CI 0.423–0.574%.) <strong>Virus cultures were negative for all asymptomatic positive and repositive cases, indicating no “viable virus” in positive cases detected in this study.”</strong> ^1, ^3</p>
<p>*<em>Have 400,000 Americans Died of Covid-19?</em></p>
<p>&rt;”Dr. James DeMeo, Ph.D., demolishes the central premise of global lockdown policies. That people are dying in massive and alarming numbers from a novel disease. He’d been waiting for the final statistics to come in for 2020. When they did, he noticed two spectacularly odd things:  Firstly, <strong>if one subtracted the numbers of Covid deaths (around 315,000) from the total number of people who died from all causes in 2020 (around 2.9 million), one obtained a dramatically low number of total deaths, lower than in any year since 2014</strong>. It appeared to him that the reported number of “Covid” deaths were being re-defined and subtracted from other causes of deaths; <strong>the people who died of “co-morbidities” were being shifted over into the Covid category.</strong> Secondly, on January 3rd, the CDC released its year-end count of all-cause deaths in one dramatically high number—268,259 to be exact.” ^4</p>
<p>&rt;”In a phone interview, DiFerdinando elaborated:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Without those added deaths, there would be no evidence of a Covid pandemic,”</strong> he said. ”This triangulation of facts: essentially <strong>no excess deaths beyond the normal annual background count; absolutely NO relationship between Covid “confirmed” cases and Covid “confirmed” deaths</strong>; and the mysterious, last-minute dump of 268,259 all-cause deaths into the 2020 end-of-year all-cause death totals; completely demolish any pretext of there having been a 2020 viral pandemic, whether caused by a novel coronavirus or by anything else and that therefore there is no rational reason to be putting masks on children, isolating elders, destroying businesses, locking down populations and shattering the public trust.” ^4</p>
<p>&rt;”Interestingly, even the hyper-orthodox German Virus-Czar and main government adviser on lockdowns and other measures, <strong>Christian Drosten, has contradicted himself on the reliability of PCR testing.</strong> In a 2014 interview regarding PCR testing for so-called MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia he said:</p>
<p><strong>The [PCR] method is so sensitive that it can detect a single hereditary molecule of the virus. For example, if such a pathogen just happens to flutter across a nurse’s nasal membrane for a day without her getting sick or noticing anything, then she is suddenly a case of MERS.</strong> Where fatalities were previously reported, now mild cases and people who are actually in perfect health are suddenly included in the reporting statistics. <strong>This could also explain the explosion in the number of cases</strong> in Saudi Arabia. What’s more, the local media boiled the matter up to unbelievable levels.” ^5</p>
<p>“<strong>Michael Laue</strong> from one of the world’s most important representatives of the COVID-19 “panicdemic,” the <strong>German Robert Koch Institute</strong> (RKI), answered that [1]:”</p>
<p><strong>I am not aware of a paper which purified isolated SARS-CoV-2.”</strong> ^5</p>
<p>“They didn’t isolate the virus, that is the issue.”</p>
<p>&rt;-<strong>Dr. Wu Zunyou</strong>, the Chief Epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><em>Quote at 1:38 in NBC video from January 2021:</em></p>
<p>“Return to Wuhan: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YbSdG2imqEM&amp;feature=emb_title">What Life Is Like One Year Later | NBC Nightly News”</a></p>
<p>&rt;“He answered, “They didn’t isolate the virus.” He was referring to tissue samples taken from animals sold at the market.</p>
<p>&rt;That’s an interesting answer.  Why have researchers and scientists claimed SARS-CoV-2 crossed species from animals to humans at that market, when no one ever isolated the virus from samples taken at the market?</p>
<p>&rt;The next, and <strong>far bigger question, is: When Dr. Zunyou says, “They didn’t isolate the virus,” is he ONLY referring to tissue samples taken from animals at the market? Or does his answer also apply to the first 40 human cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, which were claimed to result from a newly discovered coronavirus?</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2021/02/16/they-didnt-isolate-the-virus/">I’ve queried Dr. Zunyou. We’ll see if he replies.”</a></p>

        <p>So, I often use a few figures to highlight China's covid situation:</p>
<p>First 83k cases, 5.3% death rate</p>
<p>Last 8k cases, 0.025% death rate</p>
<p>I do actually think these numbers are valid, but their validity raises a lot of questions. </p>
<p>1st: Where do the last 8k cases come from? These come from Chinese people returning to China from overseas where they studied, worked or lived. Covid kills the least healthy members of society, and this did not represent the least healthy members.</p>
<p>2nd: China stopped doing intubations pretty early on, within 2 months or so. Instead, China had already developed treatment, including HCQ. Trump's promotion of the medicine came from a French doctor, but the French doctor was basing his initial use of HCQ on 3 different clinical trials happening in China using HCQ which showed vast improvements in patient results. So, China went from a method that was worsening the results to a method that was improving them.</p>
<p>So, a death rate of 1/4000 from covid amongst the generally healthy population using an effective treatment is kind of reasonable. </p>
<p>What is not reasonable is eliminating covid domestically, through lockdowns or otherwise. There is a lot of discussion about false positives, but let's see false negatives for a second:</p>
<p>&rt;https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/fact-check-how-accurate-are-pcr-tests-for-the-novel-coronavirus-1.5257357<br>
False negatives, however, are more common. According to PHAC, approximately 98 per cent of patients tested within two days of their exposure will still get a negative result from PCR tests. That number drops to 50 per cent over the first five days post-exposure, and 10 per cent after that until symptoms disappear.</p>
<p>How is it possible to ascertain and eliminate each case with such high false negative values? And many of the false negative cases had symptoms. </p>
<p>Serosurveillance research at the time shows that at least 10 times more people were infected in Wuhan than official figures show. So, how to eliminate the virus that spreads through masks, that even the symptomatic can't be tested for and has been known to stay dormant for weeks longer than the quarantine period?</p>
<p>Stop testing for it domestically and when someone gets covid, treat them with HCQ but label it a flu. Voila, no more domestic covid. </p>
<p>Assuming a innate immunity of 20% and a herd immunity of 50%, then 30% of 1.4b people get covid at a 1/4000 death rate and that's under 100k deaths for the entire country. That's a 1% increase in deaths for one year. Since most of the victims probably had less than 2 years life expectancy, then the following year will see a 1% decrease in deaths. Once herd immunity is reached, there won't be any major outbreaks and covid will be fighting with other life ending diseases for victims.</p>

        <p>Right. I don't read or speak mandarin. So the only "proof" I have, at all, that china said or did <em>anything</em> is what our government and media chose to tell us, and the lens through which they chose to frame it. Did China claim something? Maybe. But I personally don't have any proof of that.</p>

        <p>Dude, you're complaining about them having a better response. The CCP didnt publish facebook videos of old men dying in the streets from vietnam in 2012. You're literally blaming china for western propaganda and it's quite ironic.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t a fan of the lockdowns either, they absolutely had their problems, but I think it’s very important to realize that the illnesses and deaths we’ve had have been -with- all of those measures. We’ve never tried like this to stop influenza, and it shows in the number of people who haven’t caught that. We’re clearly slowing the spread of at least some diseases, I don’t see any reason to suspect we aren’t doing some good with COVID as well. Without those efforts, we could easily have seen the infection rate go higher and faster. Those numbers would have pushed the death rate up, and not at the same scale but much faster with the lack of available medical care.</p>
<p>In other words, COVID doesn’t look serious because we’re taking it seriously and it would have been much worse.</p>
<p>I’ll add, since most people I’ve talked to don’t think that it really would have been worse, that if you look at the possible outcomes of us trying when we didn’t need to, vs needing to and not trying, that I’d rather be cautious. I’ve already lost five members of my family (three on my side, two on my wife’s), and there are more who have months of long term effects and also more on the high risk list. I’ve lost enough to this disease, and don’t care to see the results of us not trying to be safe.</p>

        <p>Well, you're an exceptional case or have a massive family. Since even in the hardest hit regions of the world, the losses were 1 in 300 (0.33% of the population). So statistically, you must live in one of these regions, and have 1500 family members between you and your wife. Either way, I'm sorry for your losses. </p>
<p>You also should acknowledge that the locked down vs non locked down regions do not show a significant difference in outcome. Or the media and government would be fast and relentless in touting their evidence for lockdowns.</p>

        <p>We do have a big family, but mostly that a large portion of my family is getting older. In otherwise good shape, but still in the line of fire.</p>
<p>Again, I didn’t like the lockdowns either. I think they were ill advised, and a knee jerk reaction to some portions of the public rejecting softer approaches at a time when numbers were climbing quite quickly. They certainly had their own share of horrible outcomes. Then again, short of welding people into their own houses I’m honestly not sure the reluctant groups followed that precaution either. Plenty of people around here during that time couldn’t figure out how to stay six feet away from others in a nearly empty store, and I saw more than one house with enough cars for a holiday dinner. Not to say the lockdowns would have worked any better if people had followed them to the letter, and it probably would have made the other mental health issues that much worse, but that’s as much speculation as you can get about the lockdowns. Their effectiveness can’t really be debated fairly any more than how serious COVID is, we don’t know how it would have looked if we had taken the other path.</p>
