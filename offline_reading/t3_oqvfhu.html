    <strong>Spirituality has been neglected as part of the whole covid/ vaccine discussion.</strong>
    <p><p>To be a well rounded person, you have to take into account the physical world as well as the spiritual one. People who are left brain dominant think mostly in terms of "reason" with a lack of spiritual &amp; emotional thought. Right brain dominant people think mostly in emotional and religious terms. Either way, this creates an imbalanced viewpoint of the world. Obviously, it's not just one or the other. There's usually some kind of mixture. I'm sure very few people are 50/50 straight down the middle.</p>
<p>But, I have noticed:</p>
<p>Spirituality has been almost completely left out of the conversation with covid, more specifically, the vaccines. What's the difference between potentially dying of covid or potentially dying of the vaccine?  One is not brought on by the self. Vampires need your permission before entering. It's an old folk tale with a real message. There is something very satanic about talking people into hurting themselves. </p>
<p>The establishment keeps talking about science as a believe system, A substitute for God. They want you to believe they are the only ones who can keep you healthy. While they are putting aborted fetal tissue and who knows what else to make you sin without knowing it, separating you from God. Not to mention fiddling with you DNA. </p>
<p>There have been scientists who've also talked about vaccines that use a virus to kill areas of the brain that are responsible for spirituality. The justification for doing this was sited as preventing religious extremism. </p>
<p>Knowing this info, and then hearing about what happened during the Astrazeneca trials was  startling. Several test subjects started saying, "They killed God. God is dead. My soul is dead." The "scientists" (satanists) brushed this off as "neurological damage".</p>
<p>Link: </p>
<p>https://www.dotespace.com/read-blog/4_they-039-ve-killed-god-i-can-039-t-feel-god-my-soul-is-dead-quot-astrazeneca-hal.html. </p>
<p>Could this be why people are saying their loved ones have changed after getting vaxxed? I've heard of people noticing anger, short fuses, etc. People being "out of it" or "absent". I've even heard of people who were previously very spiritual saying they were now unable to meditate. </p>
<p>I really don't care about if it's FDA approved. Yes, I think that's letting them get away with things that would never have been tolerated before, but it being fully FDA approved isn't going to make me trust it any more than I do now. And while I believe that spirit is eternal, and know death is not the end, I worry about damning my soul to hell. Or my brain and spirit being unable to connect with God for the remaining time that's left, which can ultimately have consequences in the afterlife.</p>
<p>The people who created this thing are pure evil. I don't want the fruits of it. </p>
<p>Note: Remember I mentioned the vampire metaphor? I don't think it's a coincidence that Dracula's Castle, historical estate of Vlad The Impaler, was turned into a vaccination site. I think it was chosen for that symbolism/ bad energy.</p>
<p>I literally wouldn't be surprised if this vax had some kind of ritual put on it in the lab. </p>
<p>Sorry if I've offended any left brain imbalanced atheists. This has been on my mind for a while.</p></p>

        <p>I’ve definitely noticed that the more people don’t believe in god, the more the world has turned to shit.  People are ripping down crosses where I live and the city is so bad compared to what it was 10 years ago.  I see a direct correlation.</p>

        <p>Yeah it’s not that atheist are bad (I’m not one but have plenty of friends that are), it’s just that it is easier for people to do evil/malicious or blindly follow “science” things when they don’t have a sense of spirit or soul that they feel an obligation to. The scary part is that many of those in power and in hollywood are actually not atheist though many claim they are. A lot of them subscribe to pyramid scheme like belief systems (freemasonry) that are kind of like a secret club with tons of connections, yet at the top of the pyramid (the keystone of power) those leading individuals believe in Lucifer/satan being the god of man. They actually hate atheist almost as much as Christians. In essence, many of the elite in these groups don’t even know they belong to a Satanic cult until they are so deeply indoctrinated.

        <p>No, you're actually very, very correct, OP. The spiritual aspect of this is absolutely huge in a way a lot of people can't truly comprehend. Just look at the evil shit our "elites" are into for proof. People don't do things like that for no reason.</p>
<p>It's not for nothing that this big pharma whistleblower, a longtime immunologist, described vaccines in an interview as basically the equivalent of Communion in the RCC.</p>

        <p>I know some deeply spiritual folx who took the jab and they are feeling "weird" but not less connected to their deities. Some even express regret for taking it. So I am not concerned with that. Although certainly some scientists playing with molecules may believe (or fear) they can overcome the highest power, they are probably delusional.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I agree totally that the spiritual discussion is far too absent in all this. As soon as "religious" or "spiritual" differences are forbidden from justifying personal decisions in society, we can be certain the society is crumbling and people must reground themselves without it. That is why I have tried to consistently stand under the "religious" exemption for refusing masks rather than the "medical" one. It is a better litmus test for me of how people are doing.</p>
<p>Metaphysical anatomy undergirds everything. Betray that, and self-destruction follows. The more we awaken to this, the more nations will flower and transform in their own unique and special ways (rather than under some totalitarian technocracy).</p>
<p>The evil you refer to knows this, however, and they know their days are numbered and they cannot stop it, which is why their final plan is to simply cause as much strife as possible on their way out. I know this to be true in the reality the Goddess remakes every moment, just so her creations can be and awaken to her gifts and love.</p>

        <p>I often hear about people attempting to use a religious exemption as a loophole. For me it's a very very real reason. I keep waiting for the "authorities" to claim that exemption is somehow inapplicable and this vax is ok for all religions. Or, have a list of religions they recognize.</p>

        <p>Very thoughtful post OP! I was thinking the same. 
There is something very strange about the universal impulse gvts have had to vaccinate everybody. 
This impulse and this invisible yet formidable power is really not human, I see the hand of Satan. </p>
<p>That same hand is at work in the brainwashing process of people turning them into acolytes of some sort. </p>
<p>People are violent by nature, but the unfiltered blood stream to the brain is a very concerning issue which might alter human behaviour. Perhaps this is why as some here have suggested they (the vaxxed) are totally brainwashed and in denial showing signs of extreme violence. And we are still cognitively able to analyse and process information. </p>
<p>I’m a believer, and also a researcher by nature. The scientific and political data about cov and vaccines is just too fishy to convince my researcher side. 
But since the beginning of cov last year I’ve been unable to dissociate a very grave and dark feeling of apocalypse from what is seemingly JUST a health crisis. </p>
<p>There is something spiritual, and somber about this whole cov. </p>
<p>I know there are many believers out there of many different religions and orientations. But if we take Judaism, Islam ans Catholicism, all have a final time, where some anti and evil figure appears. False prophets swarm the earth giving false hope to people. And above all the evil is hitting hard on the ones who refuse the mark and refuse to bend and keep worshiping till the end. </p>
<p>There is also what you mention. Letting the evil in willingly like the vampire example you used. 
Even before the vaxxx came up as having deadly side effects, it felt so unnatural. As if an inner voice (guardian angel, or what ever the entities you believe in according to your religion) was informing me to stay away from it. </p>
<p>Feeling a real sense of danger for my soul and for the afterlife. </p>
<p>The prospect of being forced to vaxxx to live a “normal” life OR to outcast and become homeless is haunting me since last year. And has driven me into depression.</p>

        <p>I've been thinking similar thoughts, especially the idea of "let the right one in" (that movie was based on that same vampiric principle).</p>
<p>In classic vampire mythology, the creatures cannot cross thresholds unless they are INVITED IN. We know that the symbolism for this is about allowing vampiric forces to access your body, soul, and mind. </p>
<p>This is critical, because all the efforts until now have been trying to convince people to VOLUNTARILY take the experimental treatments. All the fact sheets (in the US at least) declare that it is "your choice to get the vaccine." Consent is a powerful force and is required for anything done on a spiritual level. </p>
<p>This is also why despite all my scientific objections to the vaccine (which are many), the main objection that weighs on me is a spiritual one and I will claim right to religious freedom as my reason not to take it. </p>
<p>In all things in life: when in doubt, opt out. </p>
<p>Also remember that Vlad the Impaler built his castle by enslaving his enemies (who murdered his father) and basically working most of them to death to create the castle. He purged the weak, the sick, and the elderly from the population, yet is still a folk hero because crime didn't exist under his reign. It's said you could leave a gold goblet in the street and no one would touch it for fear of the death penalty for stealing. He's a symbol of order by the sword and compete control.</p>
<p>On the flip side, we can also thank him as the main reason the Turkish hoardes were unable to sweep across Europe at the time. He was effective... so there's that to remember. And some of the first pieces of moveable-type printing press propaganda ever created were to vilify him.</p>
<p>In any case, we don't understand the spiritual implications at all, and I believe part of the reason that fear driven by "science" is so powerful right now is because of how small a footprint ritual and ceremony have in our current society.</p>
<p>It's an interesting correlation that in Ayn Rand's <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, there was a noticeable lack of religion or spirituality as well, and the perversion of morals is exactly what allowed for the conditions for societal collapse to take place.</p>
<p>Again, the flip side is that religion and state have always been vying for control of the populous through fear. There are dangers in trusting any institution, so best to live a moral and principled life with your individual freedoms then rely on either option as an authority over your soul.</p>

        <p>I'm glad to hear that. And I hope that continues to be the case, But it's hard to say what is going on in the brain of someone else. Spirituality doesn't necessarily mean religious. Someone can go through the motions of going to church, praying etc. I'm talking about a deep emotional connection to the non-material world. </p>
<p>Plus, very few people are being honest about this. They probably aren't even being honest with themselves. It scares people to lose that and some don't want to admit it. And some are just telling people around them that everything is fine in defense of Science®.</p>
