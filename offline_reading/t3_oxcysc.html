        <p>Fuck. I didn't read it, but I can't stand that shit. I work in a hospital and there is DEFINITELY a unique illness going around. It is like nothing I've ever seen...the way it effects our health. Bilateral ground glass appearance on xray, lose of smell and taste, micro clotting, elevated D-Dimer etc...  I suppose, if they're arguing the terrain theory, then I suppose, but why so unique all the sudden? Are they saying 5G, because that's about the only thing I can think of that might be the culprit if it is not a virus. Could it be a toxin they released that only effects the old and fat for the most part? So, ok, maybe....damn it. The shit we don't know. Fuck</p>

        <p>There’s an illness going around alright, no doubt about that.My wife works in a nursing home and saw many residents die in the winter whether that was covid or a new strain of flu I don’t know,  but many did die, more than normal pre 2018 anyway. Winter 19 though they had a lot more sick people, they had a terrible flu/covid like illness that winter </p>
<p>All I know is anecdotally anyone I know that had that awful flu from winter 2019 ( Nov19 - Feb 20) didn’t get symptomatic COVID</p>

        <p>I'm not a shill. I hate everything going on and I will quit my job if I am mandated. I just think that maybe there is a virus. So the Wuhan lab was a false flag for the narrative. Possibly. I have so many questions but I'm afraid we will never know</p>

        <p>Having watched the video with an open mind I would say not to waste your time with it.</p>
<p>My take on things is that yes there is certainly a novel virus doing the rounds. </p>
<p>It is likely, in the absence of any better explination, to have originated in the Wuhan lab.</p>
<p>The vaccines are genuine, but I believe to have overstated efficacy status and the media is being supressed by regulators (OFCOM in the UK) to minimize negative sentiment and comment on the side effects.</p>
<p>Governments are using the advent of the disease to assert totalitarian and dispropotionate top-down control measures on citizens.</p>
<p>TLDR: Both Ickes are full of nonsense, there is certainly a disease, the severity for most is being overstated and national governments are using it to push their own agendas.</p>

        <p>Thank you friend. At the moment, I am finding all the radical conspiricy theorists are doing is providing ammunition to the pro-restriction crowd. I despise being tarred with the 'anti-vaxxer/tinfoil hat wearer' brush if I so much as mention any of my concerns (particularly surrounding vaccine passports) to friends or family. I am afraid that, in my opinion, many people like David Icke have somewhat de-legitamised the position of those who are concerned by COVID, but do not see it as a significant enough threat so as to warrant mandatory vaccines, vaccine passports, enforced business closures etc.</p>
<p>Still, we persist!</p>

        <p>No. You see. That's just it. You can not say for certain it is a virus. It could be exosomal messaging telling other organisms to detox and perhaps this detox is worse for a reason 'they' may have initiated. I think we have no idea of what tech and knowledge they have. I think we have no idea the level of evil lurking. The germ theory doesn't fit perfectly here either. Very possibly a virus, but we don't know. Also, I think this was absolutely premeditated and is being used to depopulate. I hope I am wrong, but you'd be denying a lot if those same thoughts weren't very present in your mind.</p>
