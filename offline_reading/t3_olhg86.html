    <strong>Emergency Use Authorization</strong>
    <p><p>One of the criteria for Emergency Use Authorization is that there is no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.</p>
<p>In the case of covid-19 treatment and/or vaccines, the FDA has approved emergency use for drugs developed by Pfizer-Biontech, Moderna and others pending.</p>
<p>If just one of these gets full authorization, does that mean that the emergency use order expires and every other treatment/vaccine must be withdrawn?  Once there is an adequate, approved, and available alternative, then emergency use does not apply?</p>
<p>So, if the emergency use of multiple vaccines/treatments continues after a company achieves full authorization, does it imply that the approved alternative is not actually adequate?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the implication is that the race to full authorization is going to be cut-throat.  The winner takes it all.  Money is a big motivator.</p>
<p>What do you folks think?</p></p>

        <p>This is why "they" censored anything and everyone in regards to therapeutics. Including doctors and scientists. Ivermectin will/has been downplayed because there is no patent and is in "generic form" now being made and sold for practically nothing. I think they/someone will soon use all or most ingredients of ivermectin, patent it for use as a therapeutic in order to make $$$$$$$$$$$$$! Just my opinion from listening to scientists and doctors on this issue. FOLLOW THE MONEY......</p>

        <p>For political purposes, all of these shots are going to be approved. The government cannot allow millions of people to get an experimental treatment and then reject as being too dangerous. Plus it's not even their decision really; they're bought and paid for by big pharma, so that's who will make the call.</p>

        <p>They've done some things differently so I can't say for sure what they'll do here, but if it follows typical process it would basically be that once approval is gained for one of them, EUA will end for the others. The other companies' vaccines will then be unavailable in the US until they submit and gain approval. Which is likely going to be a very short time frame based on this process so far.</p>
<p>They're likely planning regulatory submission strategies in different countries and already negotiating financials ex-US so that they are never without product somewhere.</p>

        <p>They can approve all as well. Even if one gets to yell "FIRST!" that just means the others need approval to be used. Or they can say that because there is not enough of "first" to jab everyone, the others remain "emergency use".</p>
