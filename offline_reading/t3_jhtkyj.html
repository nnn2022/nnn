    <strong>Maskless supermarket shopping in the UK: post your experience</strong>
    <p><p>It's been a few days that I've gone maskless.</p>
<p>My local Waitrose: No confrontation so far.</p>
<p>ASDA, slightly further out: One day I think an elderly couple made a snide comment from behind... but I ignored them.</p>
<p>What's your experience?</p>
<p>One thing I don't like about it is being on the edge, expecting trouble all the time. I just can't relax. Hopefully it'll get better with time.</p>
<p>Also I'm always the only one without mask in the entire supermarket. I'd really like to see a few more people like me.</p></p>

        <p>a friendly grin and nod is all it takes to get smiles from behind the mask, some confused looks as well but those are rare. i’m in a red area and i’m usually still the only person without one on, and when i say the only person i mean it. it’s quite a rush </p>
<p>i never get shit unless i try to tell a worker the pandemic is fake entirely, then death stares are imminent</p>

        <p>All the shops round my area a small local businesses, there's never been a need to wear a mask, no one will ask you to wear one. That's the benefit of living in small towns where corporations and big chain stores haven't wormed their way in yet.</p>

        <p>Netherlands: <br>
Albert heijn:  about 80/85% mask wearing in the store. A brief glance from the lady at the door coutning how many are inside. No one spoke to me about needing a mask. No one even made me disinfect my trolley witht he super fancy drive in disinfecting station I've never once used since they showed up.</p>
<p>Since every individual person has to take their own trolley into the store it was very crowded. (making it harder to keep a distance)  The checkout lines were long simply because where normally a group of 4 teenagers shopping for snacks would share one trolley they now had 4 trolleys with 1 single can of Monster in it. Short chat about the pointlessness of all these trolleys with these teens. Generally good experience.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lidl:  like 75% mask wearing. Sideways glance from the lady at the door. No confrontation. I was trying to keep my distacne but an old man with a mask cam up like right behind me in checkout (definitely not 1,5 meters) and then had the gall to blame me for it. I just told him to keep his distance and paid for my stuff and left.   </p>
<p>Dirk:   roughly 70/75% masks wearing. No problem whatsoever the one time i've been there. Just take a trolley. They dont even make you use the disinfectant. </p>
<p>Hema: no problems they just make you take a basket.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've not been to a Plus or some of the other supermarkets/stores yet cause we dont have them in my village. </p>
<p>Only place i went recently (well i ended up not going in for obvious reasons) where masks are non-optional is the big medium-fancy warehouse concern De Bijenkorf who now demand masks. But they get away with it because they're High-class and can afford to lose a few people like me who just went in there to browse not buy.</p>

        <p>I have the same experience. The trolley desinfectation is retarded. It only slows the process and makes the supermarket more crowded. Few days ago there were some people with masks cleaning a trolley so I could not get one. </p>
<p>It was hugely crowded when they were done it was like being at a festival.</p>

        <p>Say there are a maximum of 50 people allowed in the store as a result of covid regulargions. They have 50 trolleys. They make every adult human or teen over a certain age take a trolley.  If the trolleys run out no more people can go in. Easy way to make sure they dont go over the allowed amount</p>
<p>Also: trolleys are big. They help you keep distance</p>

        <p>I went into a boots the other day without a mask! Even went and talked to the pharmacist, and not a word said. They were helpful, no one gave me side eye. I was actually surprised. That’s the first time I’ve been in a boots since masks were made mandatory.</p>
<p>Other than that, I do all my shopping without a mask. No one has ever said anything to me. </p>
<p>And yes, it gets easier. Even fun. I enjoy being, sometimes, the only one in a shop without a mask, including my husband. He’s compliant. He doesn’t want to be, and if he sees someone other than me not wearing a mask, he won’t. But he doesn’t want to cause a scene. Me, I don’t care.</p>

        <p>No problems with staff or other customers at Tesco and Sainsburys. Nor smaller shops like Co-ops, Costcutters etc.</p>
<p>Generally treated with the same politeness and courtesy that is given to everyone else, who knows what they’re thinking behind the smiles though.</p>
<p>At worst maybe I’ve had looks of dread while they go beyond 2m to avoid the invisible biohazard cloud that surrounds my body as I exhale, but nothing like that stands out in recent memory.</p>

        <p>I have not worn a mask all year</p>
<p>Sainsbury's: On the first day of mask requirements they sent me to the front of the queue to enter the store. I've once had someone on the door ask if I'd like a mask. Otherwise completely normal in all the stores I've visited.</p>
<p>Asda: I mostly stopped shopping there since the rumours of them enforcing masks. The one recent visit I did make it was fairly empty.</p>
<p>Morrisons: I stopped shopping there in April due to them going overboard in restrictions. I don't plan on returning any time soon.</p>

        <p>Can confirm Asda is the worst, I've been flagged down by "safety wardens" at the entrance twice.</p>
<p>No problems at Tesco, there is a warden but I just walked past him. Not sure if this applies to other Tescos</p>
<p>Aldi is the best, they don't even have Wardens where I live, just a big sign that I can easily ignore. Lots of people at Aldi with their nose out too</p>

        <p>In the UK too, specifically East England. I shop at Tesco and the Coop. So far, I've been asked once in the Coop and twice in Tesco to put on a mask. The second time I explained I was exempt but she asked if I had proof, I looked at her confused and asked what she meant, she then apologised to me and let me into the store. I'm usually the only one who isn't masked but every now and then I'll spot someone else and we'll do the awkward head nod. I've also been asked several times to put a mask on when I'm travelling via train and twice they've asked for 'proof' so I showed them the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/903452/Exemption_from_face_covering_badge_for_mobile_phone.pdf">exemption card</a> on the gov website (legally you don't have to show them anything and they're being arseholes by asking).</p>
<p>I'm a South Asian girl and most white people expect me to be timid. I suspect that's why I've been stopped but my white father-in-law hasn't been asked to put on a mask when he visits the same stores. I've had a few stares from other shoppers but I'll either ignore them or smile at them. Smiling is the best policy, it's really hard not to smile back. I also seem to be the only person who waits patiently for other customers to move so I can retrieve an item from the shelf whilst maintaining proper (un)social distancing which usually results in people smiling and saying thank you. I suspect most people don't want to wear a mask and are only doing so because it's mandatory.</p>
<p>If you're on edge, you could print the exemption template and pop it in a lanyard (or buy a ready-made one on Amazon) but really people should mind their own business and be grown up enough to leave you alone.</p>

        <p>Yeah I'm in UK, done around fifteen supermarket trips without a mask. Most without incident. </p>
<p>One time at Aldi I was questioned by another shopper. She asked if I had a mask. I looked her in the eye and said "No". She walked away muttering something. I think it's important to look them in the eye.</p>
<p>I've not had a problem in Sainsbury's or Waitrose in several visits. When I was queuing however, the person in front repeatedly pointed at her mask and made some muffled sounds through it. I ignored her and she gave up within half a minute or so.</p>
<p>At Argos I was stopped on the door by three members of staff. They offered me a mask and I refused, saying I didn't agree with the mandate and would go elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the whole, members of staff have been friendly, and most shoppers, unconcerned.</p>
