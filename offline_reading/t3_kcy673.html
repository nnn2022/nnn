        <p>This is the first time in history where the elderly have died. Remember back when we were immortal in 2019? If only coronavirus never existed then all those diabetic obese 95 year old smokers would still be breathing... The easiest way for us to continue saving lives is to exterminate all the anti-mask scum. /s because this is how doomers actually think</p>

        <p>In my city, SF, restaurant employees are protesting the lockdowns because we're lockdown with no assistance and people are starving in Soviet era food lines or fleeing the city. The people on the SF sub and the Bar Area sub are blaming us for the lockdowns now, and claiming its not Gavin Newsom's fault for locking us down.</p>

        <p>What really sucks is young people whose lives are just starting basically have to give up everything, spending time with friends, doing pretty much any fun thing to supposedly extend the lifespan of the elderly by a few years, many of whom would rather enjoy their last few years with their families anyway. And the young people are called spoilt or selfish when they just want to live their lives because the chance of them being hospitalized from this is extremely low, like there is probably a greater chance of getting struck by lightning. And they wonder why suicides are up so much? Who are the real selfish ones here?</p>

        <p>As a young person, I would much rather give up everything (till this ends of course) for the greater good. Would I rather be with my boyfriend right now and see my extended family? Yes, but, I understand that what I need to do right now is stay at home and wear my mask when I am out. My freedoms will be given back when this is over, I mean, this is only temporary. Obviously we have different opinions, but I just want you to see my perspective...  as the comment was directed towards young people such as I.</p>

        <p>As an alternative to this, I am young and am pissed as all hell. To hell with this greater good crap. If someone wants to be safe and protect their own health, that’s their own responsibility, not mine. It is not my responsibility to stop my life to prevent a communicable disease from potentially spreading. It’s a virus and they do what they’re going to do and it’s nobody’s fault. Communicable diseases have been a thing since the beginning of time and we’ve never treated everyone like they’re sick before. It’s ridiculous. I’m young, this is when I should be going to bars and concerts and traveling and meeting tons of new people and living. But no, that is being ripped away from me. I hate when those who are older say it’s not that big of a deal for us to give up these things for a “short time”. This isn’t a short time and it’s a whole lot different when you’re older and have an established career and family and aren’t going to miss out on key aspects of your life because of what is closed and not allowed to happen right now. I’m sick of being told to stay in to protect someone who has already lived their life and likely has a very short time left anyway. This whole sacrifice the young to save the old mentality is messed up. I’m sick of being called selfish, when the selfish ones are the ones expecting everyone else to massively alter or stop their lives so they can feel safe. </p>
<p>I also know many people my age suffering from severe mental health issues due to all of this. There’s no pride in doing this for the “greater good” just depression and despair from people who feel as though they’re losing all opportunity and enjoyment in life. I was suicidal this summer because of all of this, felt like life had just been ripped away from me. And when you have people saying this could last a few more years it just adds to the feeling. Screw this. If things don’t change soon I’m up and moving to Florida. Had a friend go this weekend and she partied and went clubbing and had a blast, no masks or anything where she was. It’s insane that something so normal and common is now so taboo.</p>

        <p>I find it very intriguing when there is diversity in opinions, and yes, your opinion is valid and I do understand were you are coming from. Like I said, I would love to go out to parties and have a jolly time with friends, but I understand my civil duties as a citizen. And I take pride in doing what I am supposed to to protect the people of this county, all people are worth protecting and I think that regardless of age. Also, I do understand the mental illness aspect of your paragraph. I have depression and anxiety, but it has affected me differently. I am doing better than ever, but, that is just me. And the COVID virus has definitely effected everyone differently.</p>

        <p>This is great I’m glad you feel this way but why are you on this sub? You are clearly fine with the new normal. 
I’m glad to hear differing opinions but your sentiments are lost on me and many on here. Civic duty as a citizen? What about the civic duty of those who feel the need to be protected to take that responsibility up themselves so their fellow citizens can continue on with life?</p>

        <p>If you think this "New Normal" will end and your freedoms will be "given back", you're rather naïve. Has the government <em>ever</em> returned freedoms after taking them away from us? I don't think so. Give an inch, they'll take a mile. I honestly doubt they will ever let us return to normal life. After all, they're already saying that the covid vaccine won't even prevent covid, it'll only prevent <em>symptoms</em>, not transmission, so they'll say "oh you still gotta keep masking because blah blah blah" over this, the goalposts will keep on being moved. If you think the government is really that benevolent and wouldn't possibly have any ulterior motives or corruption or plans to keep the population locked up and segregated like prisoners and cattle, you're unfortunately misinformed.</p>
