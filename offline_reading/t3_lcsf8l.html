    <strong>Let's get a campaign going to highlight the media hypocrisy.</strong>
    <p><p>We are rapidly coming up on some very important milestones in "memories"... Almost one year ago the coronavirus was starting to appear in the news. It's kind of funny but I was actually terrified of this thing long before the media flipped the switch as those videos of China's lockdown were coming out - and the world health organization was clearly covering for them. (Remember the January 14th 2020 tweet?)</p>
<p>Ive managed to completely change someone's mind at work about the whole thing - he literally didn't believe me when I told him that in January the WHO posted that there is no evidence of human to human transmission. I get it, the media has gaslit people and gotten them so mixed up that they don't know which way is up anymore.</p>
<p>Let's see what we can come up with... Dig up some old articles from around this time of year... Share them to social media on the anniversary of when they came out... Hashtag suggestions?</p>
<p>Get links, and TAKE SCREENSHOTS. Even if they start removing articles we can archive them and take screenshots before they do. Let's get on it.</p>

<p>FEB 13 - Countries with coronavirus travel restrictions are breaking the law: experts.</p>

<p>This one is fun because it literally says the world health organization advises travel restrictions do more harm than good.</p></p>
