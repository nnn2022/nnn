    <strong>Choosing not to participate</strong>
    <p><p>Many of us, myself included, feel like we have no choice in how to conduct our lives. Our freedom, our ability to assess risk, and our desire to enjoy a meaningful life rich with experiences and relationships has been stolen. </p>
<p>It isn’t fair. </p>
<p>I don’t know what can be done to win this war. But in terms of the battle, I am choosing not to participate. </p>
<p>I permanently deleted my Facebook account. I still kept Instagram to follow some local business and close friends, but I unfollowed anyone who has been posting doom and overly political things. I will not participate in the manipulative lie that is social media. </p>
<p>I only see a few people now. My social circle has been halved, almost decimated. If I were willing to schedule zoom calls and FaceTime, I might have more “friends.” But I decided that I only measure friendship in quality time, and a glitchy app with sketchy ties to China does not count. So I choose not to participate. </p>
<p>My church, which I used to love, finally started in person services. Now with a reservation system, social distancing, no hugs allowed, masks required, and temperature checks at the door. I believe that as a person of faith, our community is called to worship and cast aside fear. I’m no longer willing to worship at home alone, so I’ve found a smaller church that is less afraid. I choose not to participate in the charade. </p>
<p>I am required to wear my mask at work. But I will never wear it outside. I will never sanitize my hands when I walk into a store. I will not wait outside a store to shop. I attend no virtual events. I choose not to participate in a life of pixels and screens. </p>
<p>Life is quieter now. But I see that those who do participate are so consumed with gloom and hopelessness and despair. They get so worked up over every headline, worrying about this strain and that long term effect that some 20 year old journalist cried about in whatever poorly researched scribbling that now qualifies as journalism. </p>
<p>There is a certain calming stillness to not participating. I know who I am, and no one can take it away. I see fewer people now, but I <em>see</em> them as opposed to watching them bounce around in their living room on a screen. I enjoy meals in public without fear. Shop for non essential things, quite frequently. Sometimes I walk into stores just to smell the candles or run my hands over the clothes. Just because I can. </p>
<p>Because I’m not some tainted, diseased outcast, no matter what bespectacled government shill says. </p>

        <p>This is basically how I've been living.  Deleted zoom after one online hangout and refuse to participate in any virtual events.  I blow right past the hand sanitizer person at the front of the store and refusing to ever wear a mask outside is my hill to die on.  I also won't support any store/restaurant/brewery who chooses to do takeout/curbside delivery for the "safety  of our customers."  If i can't sit inside or browse around inside then I will spend my money somewhere I can.</p>

        <p>I almost feel bad for people who share pics of them having the 5pm beer with co-workers on Zoom. The minute my shift is over, work doesn’t exist in my mind. It’s not healthy to mix your work and social life together. If I was getting paid $150k I would maybe consider it</p>

If Internet would disappear tomorrow, this would all disappear, and they wouldn't have any more control on us.</p>

        <p>Deleted FB on Christmas. Feels great. Haven’t ditched the gram and was doing ok for the most part if you avoid people’s “stories”. It’s where people virtue signal but don’t want to have a permanent record of it in case things go sideways. I guess I’m thankful I at least don’t have any friends making their main posts about doom.</p>

        <p>At my job I was working when the pandemic started, another department was constantly stealing our antiviral sanitizer. The can itself says to not inhale it but you could smell it upstairs where we were by 1:00 in the afternoon.</p>

        <p>I've done much the same. Wake up, go to work, come home, go to sleep. Not much deviation from that. I haven't deleted my FB account but I haven't logged in since May and have no desire to. Restaurants and bars are somewhat open here but with all the security theater, why bother?</p>
<p>Work technically requires masks but my boss treats us like adults who decide what's best for us. Same with the store. Anywhere outside HEB or Home Depot and you're playing with fire.</p>

        <p>I have traveled more in 2020 than I have in previous years. I made more money working in my workplace than ever before. 2020 was a pretty good year for me. I have not and will not participate in the fear and oppression of lockdown orders. My favorite bar did not participate and stayed open speakeasy style. I'm in a small town and most people don't participate in our loony governor's orders. So you are not alone. Stay strong 💪 </p>

        <p>&rt;I am required to wear my mask at work. But I will never wear it outside. I will never sanitize my hands when I walk into a store. I will not wait outside a store to shop. I attend no virtual events. I choose not to participate in a life of pixels and screens.</p>

<p>I feel your pain man. I'm fortunate enough to work from home and have probably only worn a mask once throughout the last year.</p>
<p>But don't stop sanitizing your hands man. Fuck Corona, but germs still exist and it is Flu season. Don't catch a cold. Their sketchy PCR test might diagnose you as Covid positive.</p>
