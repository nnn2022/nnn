        <p>Like lemmings they will take dose 3 booster as well.  I'm not terrified for them tho, more of a disaffected interest. I warned my parents too back in January, oh well, better job prospects for me in future I guess...</p>
<p>The threats from public health in my area too today about unvaccinated posing the threat are just too much for me to care about someone who doesn't care enough about themselves to even use Duck duck go to do a little bit of searching on an injection.</p>

        <p>Same here. At first I was driving myself mad trying to save everyone by sharing with them what I had learned about the vaxxines, loved ones and strangers alike. Everyone either just ignored me and got the vaxxines or came right out and told me that I was a conspiracy theorist. Strangers on public forums were downright rude and ignorant to me? One person who I spoke at length with about the dangers of the vaxxines with was my cousin. He called me this week complaining that he hasn't felt well at all since he's received the vaxxines. What?! "Why did you get them after everything I told you?!" I asked him. His answer "Because everybody was saying how important they were" "Well then call up those people and complain them" I told him "because I don't feel sorry for you one bit" and hung up. Are people honesty this easy to manipulate or are they just plain stupid? My 94 year old father who's farmed all of his life and has a grade three education even knows better than to trust these vaxxines. When I brought up the subject of getting the vaxxine right away he said "No damn way am I getting that!" I have a very wise father. No wonder he's 94 and still living on his farm</p>

        <p>I don't want to see anyone hurt, but they seem so damned determined that I feel sort of checked out. I accept that most people I know made the choice to do it, and now whatever will happen has been set in motion. I feel myself psychologically distancing from them all--not on purpose.

        <p>&rt;The threats from public health in my area too today about unvaccinated posing the threat</p>
<p>Man, they just today started with that rhetoric in my area. The gov't has recently decided to take big steps towards reopening, which goes into effect on Monday. I am fairly convinced that they are being so aggressive with reopening in order to amplify the vengeance that the sheep will feel towards the unvaccinated, when they lockdown again. It's going to be blamed on us, and it's going to be ugly.</p>

        <p>Oh, definitely. People in my social circle (who were all always pro-lockdown, yet were also constantly complaining about the mental toll those lockdowns did on them) are already complaining that the lockdowns are being lifted - because now those "unvaccinated covid-deniers" can all meet up again without penalty, spread their viruses around and cause covid to spread all over again, which will necessitate another lockdown...</p>
<p>They're already fixated on the next narrative.</p>

<p>One would assume if two people take the serum and both get sick. You would quixkly connect the two and not go back for another dose.</p>

        <p>Just had a patient the other day with platelets of 1. His leveral was literally 1. Normally 150-350ish.</p>
<p>Vaccine just wiped out his platelets completely. It's fucking horrifying. Doctors wouldn't link it to vaccine and there's nowhere to report it.</p>
<p>You would think if this was a legit effort to help people and stop the pandemic, they'd be collecting data at every level to determine the effectiveness and safety in the real world.</p>

        <p>Wow! Yet when you share these stories with people they just say they're all fake even if you show them pictures. A guy in the UK watched his foot explode after his shot. He said there were chunks of his foot and blood all over the walls of his bedroom! Now he doesn't have a foot!</p>

        <p>I think this is a widespread issue. Truly terrifying. Just over 2 weeks after my mom's 2nd pfizer shot I had to take her to the hospital bc she couldn't breathe, had been getting progressively worse from a few days after the shot. None of the nurses or doctors gave a shit when we would tell them it started after the vaccine. Totally brushed it off as unrelated.</p>

        <p>Thank you. She's out of the hospital, no longer needs oxygen. Coughing up a storm but at least she can breathe🤷‍♀️ Hopefully it passes, can't imagine how her lungs will react when she gets a cold or something in the future.</p>

<p>I don't have this info handy myself, but it looks like vaccinated people are turning to mineral supplementation to help with side effects - maybe there's something than can help her? </p>
<p>Someone posted this in r/covidvaccinated that it helped them (but it was for different symptoms like depression and headaches) but maybe it helps? </p>
<p>Fulvic Humic Acid (mineral supplementation) by Black Oxygen Organics </p>
<p>Magnesium bicarbonate by Live’s Pristine powder </p>
<p>TRS for heavy metal detox.</p>
<p>And I hear about NAC alot.</p>
<p>But I really don't know myself. Research it maybe.</p>

        <p>"N-Acetylcysteine to Combat COVID-19: An Evidence Review"<br>
"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a virus (SARS-Cov-2) and is known for inducing multisystem organ dysfunction associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 have failed to effectively reduce mortality rate, especially for elderly patients. A newly developed vaccine against SARS-Cov-2 has been reported to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies in young volunteers. However, the vaccine has shown limited benefit in the elderly, suggesting an age-dependent immune response. As a result, exploring new applications of existing medications could potentially provide valuable treatments for COVID-19. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been used in clinical practice to treat critically ill septic patients, and more recently for COVID-19 patients. NAC has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating characteristics that may prove beneficial in the treatment and prevention of SARS-Cov-2. This review offers a thorough analysis of NAC and discusses its potential use for treatment of COVID-19."</p>

        <p>my brother in law got the first shot. he believes everything the TV tells him.perfectly healthy.  within a month of the jab his leg swelled up like a balloon. he went to the hospital to find out he had a blood clot in his leg. his doctor said to him that he's seeing 3 to 4 new patients DAILY with multiple blood clots from the vaccine. the doctor even said to him that he doesn't know where the media is getting thier numbers.  the media says its something like 1 in 500000 the chance of getting a blood clot.   that one doctor blows those numbers away in less than a week.
on the plus side my brother in law is now finally questioning the medias propaganda.   he couldn't understand why the news wasn't reporting on all these people getting side affects 🤦‍♂️</p>

        <p>You're right but that's a truly sobering thought: wait it out and protect your child unlikely to be affected by the virus IF they get it anyway....rush to get the vax unless a paper is released telling them not to</p>

        <p>The sad thing is, unless it happens to them, they would ignore a peer-reviewed published paper and make excuses for why it's wrong. So either way, you're damned if you do, damned if you don't.</p>

        <p>All we can do is watch and wait for this to end.  We can't stop people from being vaccinated.  If they want it, they'll get it.  This happened in 1976 and it's happening now.  It also happened with the Polio vaccine when that was nothing but people having neurological reactions to the lead and arsenic they were using in pesticides at the time.  Polio wasn't even real and they were vaccinating everyone for it.  Vaccines are deadly.  They are killing people.</p>
<p>I was not anti-vax until this year.</p>
