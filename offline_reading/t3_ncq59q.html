    <strong>Vaccine Question</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone, so I've done my research and due diligence and decided that I don't really feel like getting the vaccine is going to do me much good since I am young (22) year old who is relatively healthy (I enjoy Pizza and Hamburgers but I am by no means obese) However my Mom and some of my peers have gotten it and are trying to pressure me into getting it. I have stood my ground however they continue to use things like "Long Covid" and "Brain Cell Damage." I am curious what you guys use as defenses to these assertions because I know my chance of dying is very slim but what about other lasting effects? I don't know exactly how frequent these cases are but I am still not sold that these possibilities put me over the edge in favor of wanting the vaccine. Curious on your guys thoughts.</p></p>

        <p>Its all nonsense, you're at no risk for Long Covid or any of their scare stories. The vaccine IS the disease. Avoid it.</p>

        <p>Right ive already made it clear that if I do it I'm doing it on my terms, Im more just curious what a statistical/logical response would be I guess if someone was on the edge of whether they wanted the vax or not.</p>

        <p>I'd recommend just researching what the side effects from the vaccine looks like versus the side effects from covid look like and how often these side effects occur. How many people have died from the vaccine vs died from covid? How many people have been hospitalized from the vaccine vs hospitalized from covid? Do studies show that the vaccine is effective against covid? Answering these questions and presenting the numbers to your peers would be the best logical response</p>

        <p>You are young! The chances of dying from covid are very small. I'm 35 years young and have been in the military for 15 years, 5 more years to retire. I will be kicked out of military once they make it mandatory. The reason why I'm not getting it, is because I don't know long term effects, or short term for that matter. VAERS website already has 10k people die from vaccine, it will only increase as time goes on. When they did animal studies with mRNA all test animals died. Also, front line doctor are saying this vaccine will kill millions here in the future or make them have auto immune disease. The vaccine gave my grandma a stroke two weeks after getting both jabs, she was healthy to begin with. Men your age need to stand for what they believe in, this generation has to many men that will bow for Tyranny and submission rather than standing for qhats right. I hope you make a good decision... start using duck duck Go as search engine, Google is extremely biased and full of propaganda. Do everything opposite the main stream media is saying, they do not have the peoples best interest. Good luck and God speed!</p>

        <p>Thanks for your response, I'm sorry to hear that that happened to your grandma. I have not heard about VAERS or animal studies. I admittedly have (tried to do) my research but it is hard using google when you type in "covid" and the first 100 results are ads for getting the vaccine. Do you have more info on these studies? It is hard to do research on actual nonbiased sources on all of this stuff. Thanks for the insight!</p>

        <p>My entire staff has been injected, minus one who is asking me for help. There is immense pressure from superiors and the organization. Most members I know were excited to get it, and were extremely anxious when it was delayed. I feel badly for all my staff, as they're an amazing group of people whom I truly respect and admire. I fear for them. I was there in the beginning when the coronavirus reports started coming out and I was briefing the higher-ups. Let's just say I don't trust anything that's mainstream. It is truly a frightening world when the enemy is within and no one is the wiser, and it will eventually destroy us. It is disheartening when so few recognize it, let alone stand up to it.</p>

        <p>Alot of member have been peer pressured into taking it, I have peace about not taking it and letting go of my career. If I can't stand up to something I believe, then what's the point of even standing up at all. Good luck to you I'm the choices that you make. God says to fear not, and put your trust in him. He has our best interest at heart!</p>

        <p>I will last as long as I can in this organization. I still believe it to be a noble one, with good people who want to do the right thing. It's the belief of what the "right thing" is that has been manipulated. That we have a military which believes this new right thing is the correct thing is what is concerning to me. </p>
<p>Good luck to you as well. Right now they need me more than I need them, but that can easily change.</p>

        <p>You can find articles about long covid saying 28% actually tested negative for covid. hundreds of million cases of this virus and the talk about long covid has been very limited really. In my opinion it is psychosomatic. Especially after hearing anecdotes of the vaccine curing people's long covid.</p>

        <p>This is how I explained it to my parents:</p>
<p>I’m at statistically no risk from COVID. With my age group and health, it’s not a question of how likely death or lasting effects are, it’s 0$
%. Around 600 people between 15 and 24 have died from covid in the US since the start out of tens of millions that have been infected, and I would safely predict that these 600 people had an autoimmune disease and live tough lives already. In short: COVID is no different to the flu for me. In fact, I’d probably rather get COVID, considering my experience with COVID was a slight headache and the sniffles.
That being said, I cannot say the same for the vaccine. I cannot say there is a zero percent chance of the vaccine harming me. No one can say that because no one has had the vaccine for any longer than a few months. Even if you trust the vaccine, my risk to COVID is so small that I’m more likely to be struck by lightning this year. Taking a new experimental vaccine is not necessary for me and it’s reckless.</p>

        <p>Why are you going to trust random people on the internet over your mom and friends? Shouldn't you put trust into people who you are around all the time in your life? Long term effects of the vaccine? There are none, there can't be because the vaccine doesn't stay in your body for a long period of time in fact one of the big challenges of even getting MRNA vaccines to work was making the MRNA stable enough to actually do its job. Yes you are at low risk of severe complications but getting COVID still sucks so why do you want to risk going through it when the vaccine we have provides excellent protection on par with the MMR vaccine? I'm 24 and I got the Moderna vaccine and all I had was a sore arm for a day and half after both shots, even mild COVID gives you much worse symptoms than that including but not limited to loss of smell, fever, and a cough for 1 to 2 weeks. Why do you want to go through that if you don't have to? IK it's your choice but PLEASE don't listen to these anti science nut jobs in this sub, they are the same people who say vaccines cause Autism</p>

        <p>"Long term effects, because there are none"... tell that to people that now have auto immune disease, dead, or are now paralyzed.. also think of this your putting an experimental vaccine in your body for a disease that is 99.98% survival rate for your age. You have truly drank the kool-aid of MSN and CNN</p>

        <p>Lmao the vaccine hasn't been out long enough for there to be any documented long term effects. How the fuck can anyone say there are none? What are they, time travelers?</p>

        <p>No one said I am trusting them over my friends/mother. I am simply trying to listen to opinions and reason for myself what I think the best course of action is. I know the kneejerk reaction to anyone who has any slight aversion to the covid vax is automatically “tinfoil anti vax” but I would urge you to stray away from that line of thought because reality is so much more nuanced than that. I have a few vaccines (hepatitis, tb, hiv etc) but I am simply trying to reason for myself what the risk vs reward is for me. I appreciate your response but I think if you approached people more open minded you might learn a thing or two. Just my two cents.</p>
