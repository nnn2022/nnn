        <p>Un-freakin'-believable.</p>
<p>I first read about using Vitamin D to reduce the risk and severity of illness a decade ago.  At first I wasn't sure. But he posts links to scientific papers so I went and read them for myself. This was real medicine, not woo-woo.  So I started taking D and C regularly.  Before that I'd get seriously sick 3-5 times each winter as my kids dragged home whatever influenza/rhinovirus/coronavirus was drifting around their school.  After I took D, I'd get maybe one mild cold, or I'd feel a twinge of something, take extra D and C, then sleep as much as I could. It's not like I don't get sick <em>at all</em> but usually my body shuts it down early, or with a virulent strain, I get slightly sick but I'm over it in a day or so.</p>
<p>I got attacked personally by several people who thought I was anti-science and only taking D as a magic talisman when covid first appeared. "Vitamins don't work! They just make expensive urine!" They got quiet when I told them what I typed above.</p>
<p>This isn't the first good source of medical information I've seen get pressured or shut down.  I'm kind of concerned for the future.  Younger people who are all-in on the pandemic crap ask me for links to back up what I'm saying... and they're disappearing, one by one.</p>

        <p>Supposedly the only reason we even have a "flu season" is because people don't get as much natural vitamin D because they aren't outside in the sun. If they supplemented, the flu and other infections would be so slim, they couldn't call it flu season. </p>
<p>I work at a type of work that exposes me to illness easily. I work with individuals with mental issues that don't care about staying 6ft apart, washing their hands, etc. When they do wash them they only hold the tips of their fingers under the faucet for a second, and then immediately put their fingers in their mouth and touch everything. They don't wear masks either.  We try to encourage them to be more thorough, but it doesn't always work. I haven't gotten covid, despite many people around me having it. My significant other does the same type of work and also had many covid positive people around him. Neither of us have had a positive test.  There could be other factors at play, but I think voting D &amp; C helps.</p>
