    <strong>Top 13 Reasons Why School Has Become Untenable - Why Lockdown Measures Are Still Proving Detrimental To The Educational Process</strong>
    <p><p>1) Students missed 4 months of education and are now isolating for a fortnight under the smallest of pretexts</p>
<p>2) Student are still discouraged from direct interaction with each other, in Drama and PE lessons etc as well as in the playground</p>
<p>3) Teachers cannot approach to help struggling students and quieter voices are hard to hear from 2 metres away</p>
<p>4) Masks worn by teachers and students make this even harder</p>
<p>5) Sports and clubs have been cancelled</p>
<p>6) Homework clubs have been cancelled</p>
<p>7) Students are continually harangued with new measures and practice events for emergencies and potential future restrictions</p>
<p>8) Teachers are forbidden to come to school, until they receive a negative test result,  if they or anyone in their household has a cough or similarly vague COVID symptom. Tests results are returned 2-3 days later at minimum</p>
<p>9) New round of vaccinations starting 8th October. God knows what they’ll be getting this time round</p>
<p>10) Zoom lessons are unengaging and offer little participation from students. Many sign in and then go about their business</p>
<p>11) The new one way system in our school means everyone including teachers must walk much further than previously necessary, making everyone late for classes and/ or forced to leave earlier in order to make the next lesson on time</p>
<p>12) Travel quarantines meant many students missed the first week or two of school this term</p>
<p>13) The first positive test amongst students or teachers and one whole year group is forced to self-isolate.</p>
<p>(1-13 - Still better than closing the schools though)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Many, many more but these were the first to spring to mind. Suggestions?</p></p>

        <p>Regarding #3 and 4, mask wearing by teachers is discriminatory towards students who have hearing problems. I know of some schools that recognize this and will have teachers wear only a face shield if there is a student in the classroom who is hearing impaired. Parents of hearing-impaired children should advocate for them.</p>

        <p>Agreed, but face shields with a plastic barrier are even worse. Yes, you can at least see the mouth, but sounds are more muffled, and adults end up sounding like the parents in Tom and Jerry cartoons.</p>

        <p>Well, is there any risk at all connected with cancelled homework clubs (#6) or vaccination (#9) or anything else on the list? Like, really? Voices aren't heard loudly enough because of the mask? What if there is a construction work at school? Bad audibility just falls into the default range of possible circumstance. </p>
<p>I admire the diligence in searching out arguments but this might be trying too hard.</p>

        <p>Either you think the psychological trauma caused by these restrictions is real or you don’t. In isolation none of the measures is traumatic. In aggregate they’re cruel and inhumane.</p>

        <p>Killing grandma is cruel and inhumane too. I don't think closed school clubs will "mess the kids up", though the smartphones and fortnite very well might.</p>
<p>You can't fight the devil my brotha. It's just too strong. Maybe if we finally bow down they'll be satisfied and lift the restrictions, as redditors have beein saying for a while now.</p>

        <p>These are mostly minor complaints, except for the lack of in-person education since that is what people paid for and remote learning, while better than nothing, is not an acceptable replacement.</p>
<p>There are a few problems with the "grandma dying" line of reasoning.</p>
<p>1) It justifies anything. Old people are susceptible to more than COVID-19. They die from pneumonia, meningitis, flu, and a host of other communicable diseases. If any risk of grandma dying is unacceptable, then we never go out of the house again.</p>
<p>2) There's no evidence that in person school increases risk to families. Other countries that have has people in school have not seen an increase in deaths because of it.</p>
<p>3) Grandma can remain isolated if she feels there is too much risk from her grandchild going to school: stay home, don't visit, and she can wear an N95, N99, or P100 mask to protect herself.</p>

        <p>&rt; If any risk of grandma dying is unacceptable, then we never go out of the house again.</p>
<p>That's a huge thing right there. People realized they have been endangering grandma forever without knowing... now they've been shown the light in the form of masks and distancing.</p>
<p>To point #2: school season barely started as far as I'm aware so there wouldn't be enough data... and tbh I think if someone's out to prove something (e.g.: schools are a risk), they'll be able to built a case for it. Maybe even a convicing one.</p>
<p>To point #3: Grandma is old. She's been working for ages to ensure we would be born and then survive, and now she deserves to enjoy life. It's our duty to repay at least some of what she sacrificed for us and our parents. Also it's a real shame to have Grandma die because all that wisdom collected over all those years will just evaporate. Maybe once we've developed brain uploading we can lift the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Is your proposition that masks and distancing are permanently part of our lives?</p>
<p>Schools overseas went back to in-person education months ago.</p>
<p>Point 3 allows her to do as she pleases and gives her agency to control her exposure. If she's in fear for her life, then staying home is her only option in either case. There's no reason for others to wear masks even when at at-risk person isn't present and otherwise hinder their lives.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm honestly failing to see what might become the cue to end the measures. Either we defeat sickness for good, which is probably not happening. Or we say "ok, enough is enough, I'm willing to accept that grandma now has +1% chance of dying. And by the way all of this was pointless, because right now the situation is mostly the same as it's been for months so we basically admit we don't know what we're doing". Or we just keep it indefinitely - China has been doing it forever after all, and they've only got like 52 Coronavirus^tm deaths.</p>
