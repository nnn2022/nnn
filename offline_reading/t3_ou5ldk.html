    <strong>What do you guys think the vaccine really does?</strong>
    <p><p>Serious question, genuinely not trying to start shit. I really just want to understand where are y'all coming from. </p>
<p>I got the Pfizer last month and I'm fine. So are my middle-aged parents and generally everyone I know. </p>
<p>I haven't felt an urge to purchase Microsoft products or vote for the liberals or drink tap water or anything. I'm very much the same person I was a few months ago, but without the anxiety of having to pay 70€ for PCR tests all the time. </p>
<p>What do you think is the big plot behind all of this?</p></p>

<p><strong>In a Union of equals, there can be no second class citizens.</strong> It is unacceptable that in 2017 there are still children dying of diseases that should long have been eradicated in Europe. Children in Romania or Italy must have the same access to measles vaccines as children in other European countries. No ifs, no buts. This is why we are working with all Member States to support national vaccination efforts. Avoidable deaths must not occur in Europe.</p>

        <p>But that's already a thing. Many African countries require proof of vaccination against some diseases for entry. </p>
<p>Also remember the measures against Ebola a few years ago? Anyone coming from affected countries had to go to quarantine, much like with Covid before we had the vaccine. </p>
<p>Would you accept someone you know is sick with an infectious disease into your house? To me the passports seem like the only sensible solution until herd immunity is reached.</p>
<p>Finally, you haven't answered the question why are you opposed to the vaccine itself. 😅</p>

        <p>African here!</p>
<p>Travelling to a foreign country with dangerous tropical diseases that people from temperate regions have never encountered and thus have limited immunity to is NOT the same as getting a vaxxport so that you can stroll down the street to the restaurant.</p>
<p>STOP THIS ASININE COMPARISON!!!!</p>
<p>Comparing Ebola (50-90% <strong><em>fatality</em></strong>) to C19 (up to 99.99% survival) is so untethered from reality that you would be best served by a psychiatrist. What universe are you living in in which Ebola and C19 are comparable!?</p>
<p>BTW, we simply shrugged Ebola and continued to live our lives which is why are extremely anti-vaxx and are not following the lockdown guidelines. There are more pressing matters to address, such as clean drinking water and malnourishment. C19 is not a factor in our risk calculations.</p>
<p>How is herd immunity reached when a vaxx that neither prevents transmission nor infection is used? Didn't your prophetess from the CDC just tell you that the vaxxed are still spreading C19? Are you going to reject the cult of scientism and start killing grannies too?</p>
<p>You just proved to us that you sit in front of CNN/MSNBC all day with hypochondriac neuroses in overdrive whilst not firing a single critically thinking brain cell.</p>

        <p>Alright, so how do you propose that the spread be limited? Only two other solutions I see are: 1) another lockdown and 2) just not trying to limit the spread. </p>
<p>Another lockdown would lead to riots, while forfeiting all measures would take us all back to April 2020.</p>
<p>Also for the record, in the country where I live, PCR tests and antigen tests (incl. selftests you can buy in a shop) are accepted instead of the vaccination passport as well. So you are not forced to get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>&rt; Finally, you haven't answered the question why are you opposed to the vaccine itself. 😅</p>
<p>Because of the passports - whats the point of taking a jab if it facilitates vaccine passports? If I want to protest against vaccine passports, my only option is to refuse the jab.</p>
<p>It could be the safest jab in the world (I don't think it is - but thats a separate conversation) - it doesn't matter. Stopping the passports is more important.</p>

        <p>I think it’s fucked up how much pressure there is to get it. And the side effects are scary and not being reported on. I’m 32 I had Covid it was no big deal. Work from home I literally didn’t miss a day of work. </p>
<p>I don’t feel the need to get something with no study of long term effects for something that was no big deal for me. Especially after getting it you still get and spread Covid. How does it help anyone else?</p>

        <p>I actually feel the same. It’s being literally forced. </p>
<p>Why not do this segregation shit with pedophiles? And homicidal drunken drivers? With fire starters? With pharmaceutical companies when deceive people? Why are pharmaceutical companies not liable for injuries caused by their products? Why are there people being hurt by industrial complexes near inhabited areas which pay off governments in order to continue doing so? Why having all this GDPR theatre instead of plain forbidding (and fining and shutting down) businesses doing wrongful and exploitational usage of data?</p>
<p>How come some people/companies get away with weaseling themselves out of it, and we don’t get to make a choice on something unknown (and not only scientifically questionable but also highly ethically doubtful)?
Why the dystopian authority on this particular choice, and not any of the above?</p>
<p>And if you search deep enough, you’ll see there is actually good info out there. It’s just incredibly hard to find, not because of their size and number, but because they make it difficult for you to reach it. 
They shut down certain lines of speech, which don’t go exactly according to the narrative.</p>
<p>Try another search engine, another browser. You’ll immediately see differences in search results by using the same exact words. Algorithms, right? Why are these algorithms so obscure? The world revolves around money, everytime. “Oh, we want everyone to be vaccinated so we can save the world!” Nop. “We” want everyone to be vaccinated, because that means governments will buy these vaccines from big pharma (they are not free. They are paid with your taxes). “And wouldn’t it be nice if we had a way of getting people dependent on something we sell? Wouldn’t that be magical? So maybe we get a vaccine that works for 6 months. And then when it stops working.. oh boy, does it stop working!! Maybe we can even make the vaccines make the people more exposed to the virus at the weaning phase!” </p>
<p>We’ve turned into something tragical. We work like dogs our whole lives, fighting sickness and life injustices alone, for a piece of a tiny crumb of a cake. We forgot that we could want and be something different then this. Work your 9-5 job, comply with the rules, and maybe you’ll be able to afford a family, a house, a job that doesn’t really fulfill you, and a bit of a weekend hobby. And that’s if you’re lucky, because hey, you might have been born in sub Saharan Africa or North Korea, so be thankful. And take the shot, or you’ll kill all the grannies. 🤷‍♀️</p>
<p>Edit: adding fucking Mac Donald’s here. Obesity much? Sugary industry companies? Oh I mean, there is info out there. Their consumption is a choice you make. We only shove it subliminally into your brain, so you can “know” the product. From there to diabetes, heart disease and obesity, it’s completely your choice. We’ll just put a tiny sticker in there, or speak reeeeeaaaaly fast in advertisements, so you can be informed about it!! ;)</p>
<p>Edit 2: a little weed, so I started my answer to you, and drifted to answering OP. Sorry buddies!! Much love!!</p>

<p>There's also the possibility that some unfortunate side effects that would have easily been caught in routine mid term testing come up.  It's happened in other things before, other shots, other medications. Since we skimped on time we have no way of knowing it will happen.  I doubt it was the plan all along, but it is funny to think if the shots did cause a die off of even 10% of the population, that would be far worse than covid, but also no one would be held accountable for it.  It would be like five or six holocausts happening in the US all at once and Hitler would just be in the corner laughing at you and counting his money above punishment because that's what was agreed to.</p>

<p>Both groups hide side effects and lack of testing together.  Apparently the vaccine officially does not stop spread of the virus.  It looks like it might reduce symptoms of covid19 for a period of time.  Long term effects are unknown, and anyone who says otherwise is selling something.</p>
<p>I am curious about your perspective as well, as I do not really understand it.  Did you read the package insert before taking the shot?  How many shots are you willing to get?  Are you scared of the rona, or just complying because you want your rights back?</p>

<p>Fair enough, I'd agree. But what kind of long term effects do you expect if the vaccine provides protection for a year?</p>

<p>I didn't read anything lol. I got two shots, but I won't get the third one unless mandated by law. I'm not scared of the rona (healthy 20 y/o male, living far away from my family), but as I travel a lot, the vaccine saves me a good bit of money. That was my main motivation tbh.</p>

        <p>Define “working quite well” for me please. We now know that the vaccine doesn’t prevent spread in any way. At most it alleviates some symptoms of covid, which are mild in the first place for the vast majority of people. At worst, the experimental vaccine may have unforeseen consequences for months, years, and decades to come. </p>
<p>I think the foundation of suspicion for a lot of people here isn’t that they believe in some specific masterminded plan to control the planets population- more so that around the globe citizens are watching their leadership repeatedly make decisions that cannot be backed by logic or science despite the facade of “trust the science”. That inability to find a benevolent reasoning opens the door to mass suspicion. Never has the world’s response to such a mild threat to our well-being been so inexplicably extreme. The covid response seems to exist independently from the standard application of a cost-benefit ratio. </p>
<p>Why not lower speed limits to 35mph across the board? It would save lives, yes, but completely disrupt the lives of the population and the efficiency of the nation. Where is that sort of pragmatic reasoning during this pandemic? </p>
<p>It’s just shady that these deliberations applied to the masses are made behind closed doors by an exclusive few, touted as undeniable truth, facing no consequences for their repeated mistakes and still expecting implicit faith in their judgement. It’s shady that it’s becoming an apartheid situation over a vaccine that, let’s be frank, is shitty and was mis-advertized from the start. None of it is rational.</p>

        <p>Thank you for responding, I appreciate hearing other perspectives.</p>
<p>I agree that mRNA is very exciting - it will revolutionize medicine in a way that hasn’t been seen since antibiotics.  I disagree with taking it out for a test run for long term effects on a billion people.  If you look at the full submission for moderna, you can see that they skipped carcinogenic testing due to the emergency:</p>
<p>https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/spikevax-previously-covid-19-vaccine-moderna-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf</p>
<p>I understand there is a lot to read there.  But people should be given the information and allowed to make their own choice without coercion.  If you are 75 and asthmatic, cancer is the least of your worries in this pandemic.  If you are an active 12 year old, covid is not an issue.  People should be allowed to make an informed personal decision.</p>
<p>I think that if you received a medical treatment to get your rights back, and not because you thought you needed it, you should be angry.  I am of the opinion that if the hospitals are not overwhelmed, the government should not be controlling our lives.  But again, I know many people in my life who are jabbed up, intelligent people, so I appreciated the chance to hear your perspective.  Thank you.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what you're trying to get out of me? I answered OPs question. Am I wrong? Is making money not a reason for the existence of the vaccine?</p>
<p>Why is that important? I guess that depends. Seems like it would be pretty important to the people producing it. Also, considering the reach and scale of this product, and the not so perfect history of pharmaceutical industry ethics, I think understanding the motives, spoken and unspoken, is important.</p>

        <p>here it is!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I actually feel the same. It’s being literally forced.<br>
Why not do this segregation shit with pedophiles? And homicidal drunken drivers? With fire starters? With pharmaceutical companies when deceive people? Why are pharmaceutical companies not liable for injuries caused by their products? Why are there people being hurt by industrial complexes near inhabited areas which pay off governments in order to continue doing so? Why having all this GDPR theatre instead of plain forbidding (and fining and shutting down) businesses doing wrongful and exploitational usage of data?<br>
How come some people/companies get away with weaseling themselves out of it, and we don’t get to make a choice on something unknown (and not only scientifically questionable but also highly ethically doubtful)? Why the dystopian authority on this particular choice, and not any of the above?<br>
And if you search deep enough, you’ll see there is actually good info out there. It’s just incredibly hard to find, not because of their size and number, but because they make it difficult for you to reach it. They shut down certain lines of speech, which don’t go exactly according to the narrative.<br>
Try another search engine, another browser. You’ll immediately see differences in search results by using the same exact words. Algorithms, right? Why are these algorithms so obscure? The world revolves around money, everytime. “Oh, we want everyone to be vaccinated so we can save the world!” Nop. “We” want everyone to be vaccinated, because that means governments will buy these vaccines from big pharma (they are not free. They are paid with your taxes). “And wouldn’t it be nice if we had a way of getting people dependent on something we sell? Wouldn’t that be magical? So maybe we get a vaccine that works for 6 months. And then when it stops working.. oh boy, does it stop working!! Maybe we can even make the vaccines make the people more exposed to the virus at the weaning phase!”<br>
We’ve turned into something tragical. We work like dogs our whole lives, fighting sickness and life injustices alone, for a piece of a tiny crumb of a cake. We forgot that we could want and be something different then this. Work your 9-5 job, comply with the rules, and maybe you’ll be able to afford a family, a house, a job that doesn’t really fulfill you, and a bit of a weekend hobby. And that’s if you’re lucky, because hey, you might have been born in sub Saharan Africa or North Korea, so be thankful. And take the shot, or you’ll kill all the grannies. 🤷‍♀️<br>
Edit: adding fucking Mac Donald’s here. Obesity much? Sugary industry companies? Oh I mean, there is info out there. Their consumption is a choice you make. We only shove it subliminally into your brain, so you can “know” the product. From there to diabetes, heart disease and obesity, it’s completely your choice. We’ll just put a tiny sticker in there, or speak reeeeeaaaaly fast in advertisements, so you can be informed about it!! ;)<br>
Edit 2: a little weed, so I started my answer to you, and drifted to answering OP. Sorry buddies!! Much love!!</p>
