    <strong>No disrespect intended</strong>
    <p><p>I don't understand the logic behind being unwilling to wear a mask or getting the vaccination.</p>
<p>I know this is a fierce topic, and I'm not looking for a fight or name calling, I'm just confused by the whole thing.</p>
<p>When I lived in Japan (pre-pandemic), it was incredibly common to see people wearing masks in public spaces and shops. 
I started wearing a mask on and off when I went out and noticed I wasn't getting sick as often and I wasn't laid up with my allergies going haywire from all the pollen.</p>
<p>My daughter and I had incredibly terrible pneumonia two months before covid-19 was a twinkle in a news reporter's eyes. Her young lungs are still really damaged from the ordeal, so she's been on steroid inhalers ever since.
I have scarring on my esophagus from the violent coughing I had. My singing voice will never be the same.</p>
<p>I jumped at the chance to be vaccinated because, if covid-19 is even a fraction of the hell we went through with pneumonia, I want to prevent it. Hell, if there was a vaccine to prevent cancer, I'd be lining up!</p>
<p>I just wanted to ask any of you that are willing to answer why you are anti-mask and against getting a vaccination.</p>
<p>I'm seriously not here to argue or change your minds. I just wanted some calm, non-threatening responses about it.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a pleasant day!</p></p>

        <p>Reasonable fear to have. 
We're basically the continued testers of the vaccinations.</p>
<p>I had an unusual reaction to my second shot. My top lip swelled up dead center and then split.
Swelling stopped the next day, but it was the weirdest reaction to a vaccine I've ever had.</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.

        <p>They aren't forcing masks or vaccinations where I live, but all of the public schools and colleges have added that you need to be vaccinated (covid) for in-person learning.
Which, actually is not any different than what they were doing before. They've always required students to have their vaccines. This is just adding in another one.</p>
<p>If you don't have up to date vaccinations here (pre-covid) you can't be a part of the program. </p>
<p>I guess masks just don't bother me because I was exposed to wearing them years before this pandemic and I've made some very comfortable ones covered in Batman logos and unicorns.</p>
<p>I also hate people, so being a hermit works for me!</p>

        <p>The differences are:</p>
<p>1) This is experimental mRNA altering gene therapy with unknown consequences</p>
<p>2)  Over 90% of those infected get through a covid infection perfectly fine and develop natural immunity... so most of us do not even need these injections.</p>
<p>3) It is not just attending in person classes... with the invention of vaccine passports you create a 2 tiered society, they will dictate who can shop where, who can go where, even who can access money and other benefits.</p>
<p>4) an example for me personally, my girlfriend is in Canada, so i have not been able to see her for a year now thanks to the restrictions... once the vaccine passports come into force, only those with the vaccine will be able to travel anywhere... so for me to see the person i love... i would be forced to take this unknown gene altering injection.... does that seem fair? especially when i already had the antibodies?</p>
<p>5) the FDA yesterday said they would not approve these "vaccines" --- does not that tell you that they do not deem them as safe</p>
<p>Bottom line, they are taking away my choice over my own body if i want to see my loved ones and live a regular life... that is tyranny</p>

        <p>This isn't a vaccine, as legally defined. That's the problem. See Dr. David Warner for more information on Bitchute. The manufacturers themselves state it is a "genetic therapy". They never call it a vaccine in their literature because legally it is not. The fact that the argument over this shot has been mislabeled  as a "vaccine" is the true crime and why institutions have no legal standing to require anyone to have this "therapy" or any other before participating in or purchasing from them.</p>
<p>This will all come out in court soon and TPTB know it. This is why the government can't mandate it. Only legal vaccines can be mandated. This shot does not meet the legal requirements of being a vaccine. This is long established law. The deception by health agencies and the media to mislabel the shot is what leads to all the deep seated suspicion you see on this sub.</p>
<p>This is an intelligence test. You either do the research required to pass or...you die, apparently.</p>

<p>I personally don't see the need to see the faces of people on buses and trains (that's where I saw the masks the most often).</p>
<p>If you're out hiking in those beautiful landscapes, I don't think you'd need to worry about a face covering. Unless you're like me and pollen makes your body act like you're dying.</p>

My experience there is why the mask thing didn't bother me when it came to America. I had already adopted the practice here, well before covid, because I'm allergic to the entire world.</p>

        <p>I totally agree that kids need to see faces!</p>
<p>My daughter is autistic and because of the pneumonia, she was already home before covid-19 caused in person school closures. </p>
<p>It's a struggle to get any kid to pay attention in class, toss in her developmental delay and trying to get her to pay attention to a tablet with six other squealing kids and two teachers is a true nightmare.</p>
<p>I'm eager to have her vaccinated (again, because of her lung issues) so she can go back to in-person learning and I can get a break from 24/7 momming. She needs to be around other kids!</p>
<p>Wishing you all the best, friend. </p>
<p>I will only suggest that when you go out in public, wash the hell out of your hands before!</p>

        <p>Why are you against making it a personal choice? </p>
<p>You want to get ‘vaccinated’ and wear a mask? By all means do...I’m not against you or anyone doing that. </p>
<p>I’m not wearing a mask and I’m not getting the two shots. If I feel sick I’ll stay home; otherwise, I’m living my normal life. </p>
<p>I’m young and in good health. It’s a risk I’m willing to take. If I make it to 80 I’ll have more stuff to worry about, but I won’t want to stifle the lives of the young because my old ass is susceptible to everything.</p>

        <p>I'm not bothered about wearing masks in stores or public places really. I refuse to wear them outdoors because having sunlight on my face and fresh air in my lungs is healthy.  I don't go near people or bother them so that's not an issue. </p>
<p>Anywhoo, I am against vaccines. Reason being I live a whole food plant based vegan lifestyle and trust my immune system. I am very rarely ill, and I believe that is mainly due to my reluctance to rely on medications as well as getting enough exercise / fresh air/ sunlight/ and eating a pure diet with absolutely no processed rubbish. I also distill my water to rid it of heavy metals. </p>
<p>Now, I don't have a problem with people doing what's right for them. If you want to have vaccines that is 100% your choice, and I respect that. 
What I don't respect, is when vaccines are being pushed down people's throats. I am a firm believer in "my body my choice" and will not have anyone telling me that in order for me to have employment, travel, go shopping, or socialise - I MUST be vaccinated. </p>
<p>That in my eyes is totally unethical and assumes that
1) the vaccine is safer than Covid. For some people, maybe. For me? No. I'll take my 99% Covid recovery rate anyday. 
2) there will be no long term consequences of the vaccine. Even the "experts" cannot rule these out, because they simply don't know.</p>
<p>If we make vaccines compulsory, we are throwing our basic human rights in the bin. And so I will fight with every shred of energy in my body for people to have the choice. No one should feel pressured or forced. </p>
<p>If I die because of Covid (which I won't, but just making a point) then that would be my issue and I accept that.  I understand that some people are scared, but they will have an opportunity for a vaccine. Even vaxed people can still transmit the disease, so my not having it is not a huge risk to people who are fearful. </p>
<p>We have had influenza for a very long time. Lost many people to it. Yet people still go to work with the flu. If you could see the damage you cause to the lives of others through transmission of the flu I bet it would shock you. People die. It is natural. It's very sad. But I do not fear death because it's the only thing that is guaranteed. I will not Jab myself full of chemical cocktails so that it may "increase my risk" of beating an illness that will likely not affect me. </p>
<p>Every drug in the world has side effects, so no one can tell me it's harmless. Give it 5 years. Then we will see if it's "harmless".</p>

<p>I actually have a sun allergy, so the Day Star has never been my friend, mask or no. UV blocking clothes are so expensive. 😓</p>

<p>You are welcome. I just wanted to help you understand. And I don't speak for everyone of course. All people have different reasons for their opinions, but all are valid because we are "free" people and should have total sovereignty over our own bodies.</p>

        <p>Oh, no problem at all! I came here looking for a wide array of perspectives, not just the average stuff you see angrily posted between opposing parties on Facebook and the like.</p>
<p>I appreciate you taking the time to type that all up! </p>
<p>And yes, sun allergies exist and it sucks! 
If I'm not careful, my skin can actually get superficial bruises where my capillaries constrict and then burst.
We had a neighbor call and do a wellness check on me because of the bruising on my arms and chest. They thought my husband was beating me! </p>
<p>You know how stupid it sounds to tell a cop, "oh these bruises? The Sun did it." 😂</p>
<p>When I go out, I always have to check the UV index and take precautions. </p>
<p>I actually used to run a business where we made and sold all natural body products (I make my own stuff because of my sensitive skin). We made sunblock and it did an amazing job. Not only protected my skin, but it actually helped reduce the heat my skin took on.</p>
<p>That's the other miserable part of the sensitivity. Regular old sun feels like I'm touching a hot plate fresh from the steaming dishwasher.</p>
<p>Anyway, feel like I got into a tangent! Sorry!</p>
<p>Have a beautiful day!</p>

<p>Did you have cocoa butter in your sunblock? I used to buy sunblock from Lush and I think that was the main ingredient - not sure? Whatever it was, really seemed to work well and it smelled so good too!</p>

        <p>:( sorry to hear that! Nobody should be sending or getting death threats in any circumstances. Unfortunately there are hateful people on both sides of the argument. But most are not this way. </p>
<p>I had a few people sending me stuff  like that for expressing my opinions regarding reluctance toward the vaccine and my complete distraught toward vaccine passports. It's horrific and people should just be able to calm down and be civil about this stuff. I think emotions are running high and some people  just lose their shit instead of having real discussions.</p>

        <p>I agree! 
I came in with good intentions and no judgment and then I get a death threat and a rape threat.</p>
<p>Just... Why?</p>
<p>I think if you reach that level of rage you should get off of reddit and go take a barefoot walk.
Anger melts away as your feet start to hurt! 😂</p>

        <p>I'm against masks because when you wear one - its sending a visual message to those around you that they need to be afraid. Masks spread fear. I don't think people should be afraid, so I don't wear a mask. I believe lockdowns have been worse and kill more people than "unrestrained covid". So refusing to wear a mask is important to bring an end to lockdowns and save lives.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure I agree that masks cause fear. 
As I said, it was crazy common to see masks when I lived in Japan. </p>
<p>They either meant "my allergies are terrible and this entire city is a pollen death trap" or "I'm sick but I really need to get shit done today".</p>

<p>It's also one of the best names to call an adult instead of "asshole". It just sounds ten times funnier. 😂</p>

        <p>Hey, we all have our reasons for doing or not doing things. </p>
<p>Everytime I tried to read other discussions regarding this, I noticed it seemed to devolve into name calling and anger between both parties and I'm just not interested in all that.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for all of you sharing with me. We don't have to agree on everything, but we can certainly be civil with each other.</p>

        <p>It's very simple. The mask is Personal Protection Equipment (PPE). The individual wears it to protect themself. My not wearing of a mask in no way impinges on the "effectiveness" of your PPE.</p>

        <p>Thank you for asking. It's just as simple as this: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Surgical or cloth masks are not designed to stop airborn viruses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mask mandates are oppressive and illegal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Covid vaccine is not designed to stop the spread of the virus, it only weakens symptoms. So vaccinating the entire population is pointless. The elderly and those with co-morbidities should get it but for the average healthy person it's pointless and carries risks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are my main issues, not counting the shutdowns which are a whole other huge issue.</p>

<p>I'm eager to get my daughter vaccinated because of all of her lung issues. There's nothing like having to stay overnight in a hospital with an autistic child hooked up to oxygen. Pneumonia is so much worse than I thought it was!</p>

        <p>Short Answer: I believe in Freedom, not Communism.</p>
<p>Long Answer: There is no science backing up the fact that masks, which are being used experimentally in a general setting, actually work. </p>
<p>U.S. Code 21 Section 360bbb-3 ((e)(1)(A)(ii)(III)) states "the option to accept or refuse administration of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=21-USC-309474065-1242874613&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=title:21:chapter:9:subchapter:V:part:E:section:360bbb%E2%80%933">product</a>, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=21-USC-309474065-1242874613&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=title:21:chapter:9:subchapter:V:part:E:section:360bbb%E2%80%933">product</a>, and of the alternatives to the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=21-USC-309474065-1242874613&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=title:21:chapter:9:subchapter:V:part:E:section:360bbb%E2%80%933">product</a> that are available and of their benefits and risks."</p>
<p>In other words, we have the option to either accept or refuse the use of a "product" (or medical device being used experimentally). Masks are considered a medical device and using them in more of a general setting is experimental. The CDC has not been able to provide any studies to show that they actually work in such settings.</p>
<p>However, there have been studies to show the consequences of wearing a masks for hours on end. Also, studies AND data that show that they virtually and literally do nothing to "slow the spread".</p>
<p>The premise of the lockdown was to "flatten the curve" for two weeks. We've been hoodwinked and I for one will not stand for it. I will never wear a mask or take the jab.</p>

        <p>The main reason I'm anti mask is because it's 99% theatrics.  People have bought into this idea that any random rag on your face stops transmission.  It's simply not true.</p>
<p>When it comes to PPE, there is a reason why medical masks are made in factories according to specifications.  I see people wearing random homemade junk and stuff from Ebay.  It does nothing.</p>

        <p>&rt; I don't understand the [perspective or opinion] behind not wanting to wear a mask or getting the vaccination. </p>
<p>You don't have to understand it. You have the obligation to respect it. Just like I have the obligation to respect your opinion/option to wear a muzzle. Or three. And inject experimental gene therapy into your body. Your body, your choice. My body, my choice. It's <strong>really that simple.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; When I lived in Japan (pre-pandemic), it was incredibly common to see people wearing masks in public spaces and shops.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>There's a reason Japan is a marginal island with a fascistic population.</p>
<p>By the way, the highest amount of public casual racism is in Japan and China. Should we adopt that too? Or only the sanitary part of the Asian fascism?</p>
<p>&rt;I just wanted to ask any of you that are willing to answer why you are anti-mask and against getting a vaccination.</p>
<p>I like to breathe normally. And I don't trust experimental gene therapies that nobody really knows what they do.</p>
<p>I'll revise my opinion about the Cough19 'vaccine' (it's not a vaccine - but a gene therapy) after 2027 or even later. You know... when they pass the test of time. Like all other vaccines.</p>
<p>I will never revise my opinion on muzzles though. Wearing a face diaper is supremely dumb. I respect other people's right to be stupid in public, but I shall never be stupid in public myself.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

        <p>Masks:</p>
<p>Prior to 2020 it was widely known that masks did extremely little or nothing to prevent the spread of aerosol droplets. A sudden 180 took place in 2020 after politicians enforced mask mandates with no evidence to support the complete change.</p>
<p>Mandating masks was a terrible mistake as it caused people who were at risk to believe that a piece of cloth over their face would save them, while those who weren't at risk became much more afraid than they should have been.</p>
<p>This has been extremely detrimental to childhood development as they are growing up without seeing faces and are also being taught that everybody around them can kill them even if they aren't sick.</p>
<p>I am currently in the Philippines and it is absolute hell over here with the mask mandates. It is also the only country in the world to require both a face shield and a face mask to be worn at the same time outside.</p>
<p>I come from the UK, which has a much colder climate, and I have always had issues with heat. I can walk around in -10 degrees centigrade in a T-shirt and have no problems, but when the temperature exceeds 20 degrees, I sweat profusely. </p>
<p>In the Philippines the temperature is typically about 30-35 degrees. After spending a couple of years here, I gradually acclimated and had less of an issue with the heat. The lockdowns cooped me up at home and caused me to deacclimate.</p>
<p>Going outside, even without a face mask, is now hell again. But I have to wear a mask over my face to avoid being shot by police, who hold people at gunpoint if they remove their mask for any reason. It doesn't take long for the mask to turn into a sweat-soaked rag, which is obviously doing substantial harm. Thanks to public transport issues since the lockdown began last year, I often have to walk over five miles with this sweaty rag over my mouth.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no consideration for any issues people might have with wearing masks in the Philippines. Police have even forced me to drink THROUGH the face mask and made me quadruple mask, after noticing how much I was struggling with one mask, for their own amusement in the past. </p>
<p>The jab:</p>
<p>My chance of death or hospitalisation from COVID-19 is exceptionally low. The risks of the jab are still unknown at this point, so I feel substantially safer without it. </p>
<p>I would much rather catch COVID-19 and gain natural immunity. </p>
<p>I feel the response to COVID-19 has been exceptionally poor. Not enough has been done to protect the people at risk.</p>
<p>We may have been able to achieve natural herd immunity last year had we taken measures to protect those at risk, while letting people who were not at risk go about their lives. Instead lockdowns were opted for and elderly patients were sent to care homes to die.</p>

        <p>Maybe you can explain why you and others find it necessary to come over here and preach to us. If you want to wear a mask or need to wear a mask, then by all means do so! If you need or want the vaccine, then get it!</p>
<p>Why do you find it necessary to force your beliefs on everyone else? This is just like religious fanaticism. I'll bet if some preacher got in your face at least once a day and told you that you're going to hell if you don't believe exactly what he believes, you'd start to get pissed also. </p>

        <p>...I literally didn't come here forcing any beliefs on anyone. </p>
<p>I was very respectful...</p>
<p>I just wanted some level-headed responses. If you don't want to get vaccinated, I don't care?
If you don't want to wear masks, I don't care?</p>
<p>I didn't come here looking for a fight. 😞</p>

        <p>Your perspective was to get angry with me for coming here and asking for your personal opinions and stories for your choice to not be vaccinated or not wear a mask.</p>
<p>I didn't come here to preach. I didn't come here to be a self righteous ding-a-ling.</p>
<p>I didn't come here to plant seeds of contempt. </p>
<p>Thank you for your response. I'm sorry I aggravated you. That was not my intention.</p>
