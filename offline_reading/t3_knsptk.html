    <strong>HR is on my side</strong>
    <p><p>So I approached my HR manager at my workplace the other day because I was concerned about potentially losing my job over refusing the vaccine. I felt comfortable doing this because she has been very helpful with everything so far and has straight up told me she thinks masks are bullshit. 
So I say to her- hey, i just wanted to ask of you’ve heard anything about the vaccine yet and if you think they might try and make us take it. Because I’m not taking it so if its going to effect my position here I need to know. She tells me they haven’t had that conversation yet, but if it comes to that she’ll be in the same boat as me and jokes about us starting a business together and employ people from our current work at our new business. </p>
<p>This made me so much more comfortable with keeping my job knowing I have HR on my side and she will likely fight with those of us who refuse vacation. I just wanted to share this here because if you’re unsure I urge you to talk to someone at your place of work who you trust. Wether it be HR, your supervisor or even just a co-worker. It will make you feel better knowing you have at least one other person willing to back you up.</p></p>

        <p>Just be careful. As a rule HR is there to protect the company only. They act like they are there to help workers to get you to open up so they can use your words against you later. </p>
<p>While that HR person might be in agreement with you if it became a directive she’d lose her job if she didn’t enforce it. </p>
<p>If you feel like you need protection never go to HR but call a lawyer first.</p>

<p>This is why I doubt when people make claims like that here. This is the second "HR told me we'd never get the vaccine, and we were BFFs about it" story in the last week or so. It just seems bizarre. Maybe I just had crappy luck, but my HR in previous jobs was never so casual with me or the other workers. </p>
<p>Also, you are right. Even if this is 100% true, if the company makes a mandatory vaccination a policy, HR will side with the company/their job over the workers. I bet many of them will willingly take the jab themselves.</p>

        <p>Ive known my HR manager for about 3 years now. I knew her before I even got this job. The difference is character. Knowing someones character and knowing you can trust them makes it easier. Ive been telling her shit that I wouldn’t tell anyone else I work with out of fear of getting fired for months now. Ive been in her office swearing and crying about how awful all of this bullshit is a few times now.</p>

        <p>She has a pretty good rep with me and a few other people about not going to higher ups to get us fired. I know theres a certain amount she has to do, but a lot of closed door conversations don’t get repeated. I also have a feeling that most people where I work won’t get it, but some will of they require it. So its kind of that grey area where no one really knows whats going on and what they can and can’t say about it. Regardless, I’d rather not work at a place thats going to require it. I was mostly just asking so if I need to figure something else out, I have time.</p>

        <p>That's good.  But isn't it fucking sickening we even have to worry about this shit?  My sister's husband's employer is apparently going to make everyone get it.</p>
<p>It just boggles my mind that we've gotten here.  If corona was a demonstrably lethal killer of young and healthy people striking us all down one another I <em>might</em> consider taking a rushed vaccine pushed by nefarious actors THAT HAVE PULLED THIS SHIT BEFORE <a href="https://healthcare-in-europe.com/en/news/european-parliament-to-investigate-who-pandemic-scandal.html">https://healthcare-in-europe.com/en/news/european-parliament-to-investigate-who-pandemic-scandal.html</a></p>
<p>But since it does not appear to be that and the greatest risk it seems to pose is the projected overwhelming of hospitals which is always going to happen in 2 more weeks, I want nothing to fucking do with it.  Nothing to do with a vaccine that apparently won't prevent transmission for a virus with a survivability rate of 99.98% that occurs as no worse than a cold for most and for which there is evidence natural, long lasting immunity can be developed.</p>
<p>My theory is that the masking of healthy people &amp; insistence that asymptomatic spread was a real thing was done to inject a moral element into all of this and lay the groundwork for being viewed as an evil covid carrier if you don't take the vaccine.  Apparently the whole global pandemic is due to not enough people wearing masks, or not wearing them correctly, or not denying themselves human contact because healthy people transmit the virus.  And now it's going to be those who won't get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Fucken SICKENING I say.</p>

        <p>I hear you. Pretty sure the vaccine doesn’t even work. In fact I’m convinced- and hear me out- that it’s being used to spread a new strain. They’re driving up the cases with numbers that don’t make much sense. Just looking at where I live, 99% sure the case count is just a ploy to fit the narrative. Either that or people are just testing positive for literally anything with the PCR tests and they’re counting it for covid. That’s what they do with the deaths anyways.</p>

        <p>yes but they are not people. to be a normal person requires human empathy which they do not have. they are soulless monsters who do nothing but protect the company from liability. if there was anything the the office got correct about the workplace, it's that HR is an unfunny jerk of a department that sucks all the fun from the workplace. if they mandate the vaccine, and you want to keep your job, you WILL get it and this friend of yours will not waste a second throwing you under the bus.</p>

        <p>I had a similar-ish experience. My co-worker threatened I was not to go back to campus unvaccinated so I told my manager that was discrimination. She then said herself that she is hesitant about having the vaccine, she was unsure if it would cause long-term damage. She proceeded to get her manager to tell me in written that vaccination would not become mandatory for me. Even if they backpaddle on that, it‘s put down in written and a lawyer can help here. Also, there is such a thing as religious exemptions - MCR5 are aborted fetal cells. There is always a way. Not sure a lot of companies could afford the legal discrimination suits if they forced vaccines on everyone.</p>
