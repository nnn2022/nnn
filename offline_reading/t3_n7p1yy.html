    <strong>Is fear of nature the reason why so many would rather take their chances with vaccine risk than risk of natural infection?</strong>
    <p><p>From figures available so far, it seems that the overall risk of severe or fatal covid and the risk of severe or fatal adverse vaccine reaction might turn out to be broadly similar when you take the data from all age groups. In both cases, mortality is less than 1%.</p>
<p>But the risk profile for covid infection versus vaccinations changes significantly with age. So if you're over 80, your risk from covid shoots right up, and if you're under 30 it becomes very, very low. Conversely, the risk of vaccination injury seems to disproportionately affect the young.</p>
<p>The group most at risk from covid seems to be older males, whereas the group most at risk from covid vaccination seems to be younger females. Children have a statistically tiny risk from covid, but preliminary data from VAERS suggest they may have a higher risk from vaccination than adults.</p>
<p>For each individual then, their own relative risk profile is a factor of their age, sex, and other factors such as comorbidities. The risk from covid infection increases with age, whereas the risk of vaccine injury increases with youth. If you plotted age and relative risk from vaccines versus natural infection on a graph, at some some point the lines would likely cross over. At that point, and that point only, it's roughly 50-50 whether you're better off getting vaccinated or risking infection with the disease in the wild.</p>
<p>But for most people who're vocal about discussing this stuff on social media, that's not the case. Their risk isn't 50-50. For most healthy people under 50, and certainly under 40, the risk of severe or fatal covid is low enough that the risk of vaccine injury does not seem worth taking.</p>
<p>Yet, so many are mad keen to get their shots. Why?</p>
<p>It occurred to me that this may be due to something like a fear of nature. People are so dependent on socialisation and socially constructed, climate-controlled environments, that they are more afraid of accepting a lower personal risk from a natural infection than they are of taking a greater personal risk from a socially approved, government recommended, media promoted, peer pressured, synthetic, genetically-modified, still only partially-tested, vaccine technology.</p>
<p>They are terrified of the wild, unregulated domain of the virus and tend to put their trust in the socially policed and cultivated domain of the  vaccines. They say "trust the science" without realising what an oxymoron that phrase is when repeated sloganistically, hash-tagged and re-tweeted. Science is not supposed to be based on dogmatic adherence to conventional wisdom, nor to blind faith or trust in authority, but rather on questioning and observing, on testing and reformulating hypotheses against the weight of evidence gained from experiment and research.</p>
<p>There's no doubt in my mind that nature can be scary. Predators, earthquakes, fires, famines, snakes, diseases, all these things have been with humans during our evolution and we're naturally avoidant of their dangers.  But human beings and human societies can be extremely dangerous too. Tyranny, war, oppression, exploitation, deception, enslavement, and bureaucratic, regimented evils committed by people who were "just following orders" are things that history has taught us are just as much to be feared as the dangers of the natural world.</p>
<p>But for some reason more people seem to be more afraid of nature, including their own and each other's nature, than they are of socially organised systems which have at least as much potential to cause harm  as they have to do good. They don't trust their immune systems to protect them against a virus with an over 99.98% recovery rate in their age group, but they do trust a pharmacuetical company with a proven record of criminal scientific fraud and mis-selling of medicines with potential to harm.</p>
<p>When did we get so afraid of nature and so trusting in society? Both have good <em>and</em> bad, healing <em>and</em> harmful aspects. But so many modern humans seem terrified of one and utterly dependent on the other.</p></p>

        <p>A doomer claimed that the chance of dying from the Pfizer vaccine was only 1/22000, so everybody should get it as the risk is so low. However, they didn't cite a source. Does anybody know where they got this figure from? </p>
<p>It's poor reasoning from what I can tell as this doomer is telling me that the vaccine is almost four times more likely to kill me than COVID-19 is...</p>

        <p>You can't just go by absolute chance of death.  You have to to a risk vs benefit analysis to get the whole picture.  Here's a quick breakpoint calculation I did for the AZ vaccine.</p>

<p>Also, Pfizer and Moderna only looked at relative risk to get their 90% effectiveness figure.  Looking at absolute risk, the vaccines are only about 1% effective.</p>
