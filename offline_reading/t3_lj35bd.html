    <strong>What price have you paid for this pandemic?</strong>
    <p><p>This pandemic came at a cost, and everyone had to pay a price.  </p>
<p>Some people are paying with the minor inconvenience of not being able to go to restaurants, or get their hair cut.</p>
<p>Others have lost everything.  Their businesses, their livelihoods, their independence from government.</p>
<p>But it's more than just that.  It's hopes, dreams, plans, life goals.</p>
<p>It's about a person's <em>constitution</em>.  Their <em>raison d'être</em>.  The reason they get up in the morning.</p>
<p>My mother is a Doomer, and she never understood why I was so angry and against these lockdowns.  But the other day, I think I got through to her with the following example.</p>
<p>She loves piano.  Her whole life is piano; she's being playing since she was 4.  She plays everyday, she listens to piano music everyday, she's a teacher and a concert pianist.  Piano is her life.</p>
<p>I asked her how she would feel in a world if she could no longer do piano.</p>
<p>She looked at me and nearly cried.</p>
<p>Then I told her maybe now she might understand how some of us feel.</p>
<p>Many of us here have paid a massive price.  We made a huge sacrifice.  Artists who will not be able to perform.  Athletes who have missed their chance to compete.  Foodies who slaved away in a kitchen for years who have had their dreams taken away right from under them.  Their <em>raison d'être</em>.</p>
<p>This isn't about money.  Thinking about it on economic terms is devastating enough, but it goes much deeper than that.</p>
<p>Many of us have paid the price with a part of our soul.</p>
<p>Now we're being yelled at by a bunch of spoiled brats whose biggest sacrifice is they can't get their spiced latte on their way to their corporate job.</p>
<p>They haven't missed a single paycheck this entire time.  They haven't had their lives and life goals completely disrupted by this.  They haven't had to give up a piece of their soul.  </p>
<p>What is the thing that makes you <em>you</em>.  And what part of that have you lost because of these lockdowns?</p>
<p>What price have you paid because of these lockdowns?</p></p>

        <p>well, at least youre hating the right people. at least you arent hating people based on immutable characteristics. those that exert power over others, and those that abuse their authority over others, deserve an infinite and limitless amount of hatred</p>
<p>the best we can do is fight back in every way possible. or flee to a freer state</p>
<p>but the sad thing is, if you were to go to a therapist about your hatred/anger, they would show zero sympathy for you. he or she would call you a lunatic for not being OK with the new normal, aka authoritarian tyrannny. the therapist would be dismissive of your feelings about authority. shame that dissenters and nonconformers are receiving zero empathy and compassion while abusers of power are being deified and worshipped</p>
<p>if you have likeminded friends, family, loved ones, acquaintences, talk to them about your hatred and anger and not a therapist</p>

        <p>Me as well. I have never been so angry in my life. I feel so alienated and hopeless. It's like I'm a different person from a year ago. I don't like it either but I do realize the anger in part comes from seeing the new normal for what it is.</p>

        <p>better to hate authority than to hate based on immutable characteristics. your anger is 100% valid. its a sign that you're sane and that youre a good person. people who aren't angry and hateful towards rule makers &amp; rule enforcers have something terribly wrong with them</p>

        <p>I am currently a contractor in a multinational. There was a hiring freeze and I lost potential job opportunities as a full-time employee because of this. I am grateful I have a job, but still it hurts to think I could be full-time.</p>
<p>I became addicted to Twitter. At first to check news and case numbers. However, I now check profiles to check their opinions. As you know, Twitter is extremely toxic.</p>
<p>My mental health has suffered. I haven't been able to sleep well in months.</p>
<p>I have gone through a lot of difficult situations in my life. This has been way worse than all of them combined.</p>

        <p>I lost my job. I started in 2015 as just a way to make money after I got laid off after Christmas. We started to grow and my pay increased. Our product was making waves in the local area, even won 1st place in a competition in China competing against 200,000 other food products from all over the world. </p>
<p>Sid Miller the Texas agriculture commissioner was there and ended up coming to our Grand Opening. We had all natural ingredients and only 5 of them. </p>
<p>Scored a big contract with A.I.S.D, upgraded to another building (bigger)  and I landed a nice salary that was due to double in 2020. Then the lockdown happened and they shut down the schools which nullified the contract. Now I'm unemployed and watched all that hard work disappear along with my money. No one gives a fuck either. I get lectured all the time by these people who get to stay at home and collect their paycheck. I busted my ass and I lost everything....</p>

        <p>Yes, this has been big for me. I dont go on a whole lot of dates. Maybe a few a year. Thats no biggie. Its the fact that now the opportunities are basically zilch. At least in 2019 there were plenty of women out and about, mingling at bars, etc. Now people are so incredibly covid conscious that it makes people be untrustworthy of others.</p>

        <p>I’m ok for now but I lose a 6 figure job with great benefits that I held for 33 years. I have time. But it showed me something I was insulated from. I got unemployment and it’s $404 per week. Then I applied for Medicaid and was denied since I make more than $900 per month. So Illinois thinks the $1600 they pay me is too wealthy to see a dr. That opened my eyes to them not giving a single fuck about people. Also if I wasn’t a good investor on the side.. I have no clue how people get by. My loss is the benefits. Many of people in my circle have it a lot worse.</p>

        <p>I worked for a young doctor once who was really loved by his patients. Then I started seeing him interact with Medicaid patients. It was hard for me to bite my tongue. I would over compensate for his rudeness and lack of care, and I had one patient break down crying on me for showing her care and respect. I apologized to her on his behalf. I have great insurance and a nice health savings account and regularly get treated like shit by health professionals, but seeing his night and day treatment of Medicaid patients will haunt me forever.</p>

I know for a fact that when I can no longer use my insurance with him that he'll be able to charge me a lot less.

        <p>That's really strange I've been getting unemployment the last few months and I make about what you do on it and I'm able to have Medicaid. Medicaid covers everything. Covers my physical therapy. My therapy. Any doctor's appointments that I need.. sorry your state isn't allowing you to have both.</p>
<p>It's not counted as income towards Medicaid.. you might be able to fight that</p>

        <p>No problem! I would try giving them a call because that's usually the best bet.. let them know that you currently do not have a source of income. You are on unemployment and previously were denied because of that. I guess make sure in your state that it doesn't count as income.. but as far as I know that really should not be the case. Good luck</p>

        <p>I haven't lost anything physically thank god. But my soul has taken a hit. Being a young man who can't even land a part-time job is soul-crushing, I feel like a kid, needing to take handouts from the government(mommy) and my parent's to survive. I want to be my own man, but it's hard when the government(mommy) seems to gleefully enjoy doing shit that makes it impossible. </p>
<p>I've also lost my faith in humanity. Although it's starting to slowly come back as I see more and more people around me (who initially called me a lunatic for thinking lockdowns were a terrible idea)  come around and start to agree that lockdowns are fucking stupid. </p>
<p>I just don't understand how anyone thought that lockdowns were an appropriate plan. I really don't. From the moment I read the initial covid stats I knew that lockdowns were like swatting a fly with a sledgehammer. It never made sense to me. But after everything I said would happen, started to happen people have finally started to wake up</p>

        <p>I've spent the last year basically alone. I WFH, and the office was most of my socialization.</p>
<p>I've had so many weird ideas. I don't remember the last time I slept through the night. I'm forgetting words. I no longer see people as essentially good-intentioned, but as selfish and cowardly.</p>
<p>I try to be guided by my principles but idk honestly if I'm not wrong about that too. If it even matters when most people do what is easiest for them and fuck everyone else.</p>
<p>In short, the reaction to the virus has opened my eyes, ruined my mental health, turned me into someone I don't recognize, and utterly destroyed my faith in humanity. All over a 99.8% survival rate.</p>

        <p>I’ve capitalized on it with no regrets. My state opened up a few coronavirus hotels where they house homeless people who have tested positive but are not sick and don’t need hospital care. </p>
<p>I’m a registered nurse and my state is paying me 65 dollars an hour to sit in the hotel lobby and assess any “patient” who might feel sick. </p>
<p>Basically, no one is sick and I just sit on my phone scrolling Reddit or watching movies while napping in between cashing in on this. </p>

        <p>I'm a musician- my kirtan band has been playing every week for the past 6 years and has been a big support for spiritual community here.  We got together a few times for online shows in the summer, but not being able to play regularly with real people has been painful for me.  Playing with people, for me, is the joy of music.</p>
<p>Also, having switched most of my music lessons to online format sucks.  i make the best of it (and I have a few parents who don't care, so I see their kids in person). but overall, when I play duets with my students, they have to mute on their end, so I don't get the joy of hearing our harmonies.  Also it's very hard to teach improvisation without being able to jam with people in real time.</p>

        <p>Definitely!  I make my students have a metronome with them, but we also do a lot of them muting, us clapping/bowing/strumming the rhythm together repetitively, then them playing it to me to make sure it actually worked.</p>

        <p>Thank you for understanding and I wish your Mom the best. It's tough!  My Mom is in a more normal town and has been teaching in her house, maskless, through this all (except maybe a month at the beginning of lockdown).  I'm jealous.</p>

        <p>I've worked through all of this because my employer is considered "essential". Once the lockdowns started people started showing their true colors and it made me lose faith in humanity. I've seen grown adults act like toddlers. I've been screamed at by scared doomers because even though they chose to come in the store to shop, they think they shouldn't have to touch anything. I've had my life threatened by customers. One man said I was pure evil because I refused to put a mask on a customer who chose not to wear one. This doomer expected me to walk up to a complete stranger and literally force a mask onto his face... I was once someone who enjoyed working with the public but not anymore. </p>
<p>My mental health has gotten worse and I find myself wanting to isolate myself when I'm not at work. I feel completely alone and wish I could just disappear. </p>
<p>I've lost time with family because they chose to cancel Thanksgiving and Christmas. We also don't do family parties anymore. I'm the crazy one in the family though because I'm not a mask-loving doomer.</p>

<p>Many parties, meeting friends, smiles seen, hugs, women being interested etc. Also working is much much worse now.</p>
<p>The gain is I have saved so much money because of this. But barely any use because RTX cards is out of stock, so is new Xbox and we can't really travel.</p>

        <p>I've lost alot of respect for a lot of people.
Thankfully we didnt really lose money as my husband is military and on salary and I work in group homes, the my hours definitely took a hit.
I had my second son in sept, and I feel like an absolutely terrible parent for brining them into this shit show :( I'm terrified for the future that will be left for them.
Haven't seen my family in about a year and a half since we were posted away, we were gonna go back home for a vist in nov with the new baby but that never happend, now my grandmother has lung cancer and I really want to get home so she can see her great grand babies, my other grandmother is slipping into dementia and I want to see her before she forgets who I am.
Ns has a stupid 2 week quarantine for anyone who comes in so i gotta go for a month to have 2 weeks of freedom.
And to take my toddler on the plane he has to wear a mask, which he will not. I'm just tired</p>

        <p>2020 was my last year of High School. I missed almost half the year of school. Months and months of being at school, of enjoying every last bit of it for the last time, gone.  Hundreds of little moments with my friends and teachers and classmates, gone. My favourite extracurricular activities, gone. Graduation and other end-of-year-12 activities? A shell of what they were supposed to be. Invaluable time that I will NEVER get back.</p>
<p>I've lost my faith in humanity, my belief that I would at least get a chance at living a semi-normal life in the future. I am filled with anger and resentment towards the vast majority of the public. I feel more alienated from society than ever.</p>

<p>My only advice is twofold:
A. There are some good people still out there.  This sub is proof of that.
B. We will never forget the people who did this to us.  </p>

        <p>I've had my busiest year business wise, and while thats not terrible considering what some people are going through, there was a period of time I didn't have a day off in 3 months. Work has become the only thing to do for the most part. Feast or Famine has divided the work force.</p>
<p>As trivial as it sounds, my daughter, wife, and I have made a pastime bowling the past 4 years on a weekly basis, and we haven't been in almost a year. </p>
<p>I'm incredibly fortunate that I've made my life the way I have before all this, so I don't have a ton of suffering to complain about, but I absolutely hate compulsion in any form. Regardless of situation, individuals shouldn't be compelled to bend over for another.</p>

        <p>And others have lost young people due to overdoses and suicides, and there will be more. Lockdowns have a massive toll that epidemiologists aren’t looking at. Having empathy towards only people who’ve died with covid isn’t actually empathy.</p>
