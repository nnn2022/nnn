    <strong>Totalitarian tip toe</strong>
    <p><p>One of the characteristics of munchausen's syndrome is being obsessed with medical equipment, terminology, statistics, etc. These people are DEFINITELY "pro-science". I knew a person that had it, and it reminds me of some of the covid obsessed people. I think there are a number of reasons why people fall into the doomer catagory. And this type of mental illness is probably only a small minority, but it probably accounts for some of them.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people enjoy certain aspects of "the new normal". I have to admit, it's nice not to have to drive an hour for work trainings. I can now do them on zoom or another computer based setup.  </p>
<p>But because I'm aware of history, I know that most likely this shit is being done to remove the middle class and get us used to lowering our standard of living (the great reset). I'd describe it as a Cloward And Piven Strategy under the guise of a medical emergency. If covid was just some random thing that happened, and our rulers didn't have the tendency to seek power and destroy, maybe I'd go along with it. People need to realize that just because they are cooperating with wearing a mask because they are told it's the kind thing to do (and because they think it's unselfish), that is not the true intention of the people making these decisions. The threat of tyranny and government overreach is much more severe to everyone than being unmasked. And since not wearing a mask is the only way to show you don't give consent, that is what must be done.</p>
<p>I have asthma and other prexisting conditions. So I should want people to wear masks right? Well I'm not going to be on this earth forever nomatter what. And, even though I don't have children, I care about the next generation and whether they will live in a free society. I fear that we are losing the spirit of what this country was founded on. If the Revolutionary War was fought today, we'd be in big trouble because the psychological warfare would be so profound, people would be convinced it's politically incorrect to be free and independent. No guns would even have to be drawn. </p>
<p>I'm tired of people who proudly wear masks acting like they are the ones making sacrifices for everyone else. Their submission is setting the tone for the next few decades. If this is a test to see what we will endure, we have passed. Our reward? More, rules, guidelines, laws, even taxes. Wearing it and complying IS taking the easy way out. The easy way in regards to anything never gets you anywhere in the end, except more misery. It may be a temporary comfort. You don't have to be worried about being yelled at, removed from an establishment etc. Hell, you may even be praised or admired. But it will cause damage long term. Freedom generally isn't lost all at once. It's a gradual process so you don't even know it's happening. Some call it "The Totalitarian  Tip Toe". And there's always a cover story or a justification. In the name of safety we will give up all of our rights. The government doesn't even have to use force. The nannying public will lay down the law for them.</p></p>

        <p>Good points.  The effectiveness of masks is not really important to me as it's not anyone's business but mine what I want to put over my face / breathing holes.</p>

        <p>Somewhat related tangent re your last paragraph: we as a society have all but entirely abandoned the principle/strategy of short term deprivation for long term gain. This is one of the primary developments (if not THE primary development) of the human brain that makes us superior to other species. We are capable of sacrificing energy and resources in the present in order to obtain a long term goal (e.g. we learned to hunt animals and instead of eating it all at once (like a wolf would do), we preserve it and ration it for difficult times, we sacrifice decades of our life educating ourselves for increased earning potential later, we send a % of our earnings to a 401k for retirement, etc.). This sort of short term sacrifice is necessary for long term and meaningful reward, but our culture is so focused on immediate gratification that many people (whether consciously or not) no longer see the necessity of short term deprivation/unpleasantness/sacrifice/etc. to achieve a goal. I really think this explains the behavior of a lot of people complying who otherwise maybe would not. </p>
<p>The narrative that you can have what you want right now without paying any price for it is pushed incessantly and there haven’t yet been any events in recent history to shatter that illusion (but, for example, I think it would be hard to find a member of the Greatest Generation who didn’t think that good things are only obtained in the long run through perseverance and personal sacrifice). </p>
<p>Also, the above might seem to justify lockdowns as a temporary hardship to eliminate Covid. But it doesn’t. Not giving in to tyrannical gov control in the face a “public health emergency” in order to potentially lower the already minimal risk is the sacrifice that should be made now to achieve the long term goal of preserving personal freedom. The irony is not lost on me (nor I’m sure is it lost on a lot of people in this sub) that accepting authoritarian gov control and expecting the gov to bail you out financially from your lack of freedom is now hailed as a valuable act of self-sacrifice from which we will reap benefits in the future. It’s all ABSOLUTELY INSANE FUCKING GARBAGE FROM TPTB.</p>

        <p>Yes, you really broke it down great! Suppose for a second that reincarnation exists. I don't know if it does or not, but trying hard to preserve this life by doing things that will contribute to erosion of future freedom is not a good deal. Especially if you are born into it in the future and don't know any better. Your chances of turning that around are slim to none.</p>
