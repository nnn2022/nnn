        <p>One of the things I've noticed for years is that there is always a steady stream of haters spamming in my community.  It's strange because I've never spent any time posting in the communities I think are absurd. Really make me think.</p>

        <p>Maybe because it's ridiculous that we have people like you complaining about fighting a pandemic. Think about this, if everyone stayed the fuck home in the beginning of this whole thing we would already have had it under control, it's now ballooned to 14 million cases total, remember when it was only one dude in Washington?</p>

        <p>right a cloth that is bigger than the actual corona virus. Think bigger, if they can push masks on people what else are they going to try to push on you? Where were you in the past years when flu was around? You didn't care about other people then, did you?</p>

        <p>Yes, because you clearly can tell when someone catches COVID-19 from a specific person. More likely than not, most of the people on this subreddit comply with the masking and social distancing, and lockdown measures because without compliance you are not allowed to do anything anymore in these times. </p>
<p>Further more, compliance does not make anyone a hero, compliance does not save anyone. People die every day from preventable causes like hunger, abuse, suicide, etc. And no one gives a flying fuck about that and never will. You are not a hero for doing what the government tells you to do, which you can bet your sweet ass they do not do when off camera or not addressing the public. </p>
<p>The fact that programmed hate is so wide spread for people who question the narrative, that is one of the real pandemics going on.</p>

        <p>Oh spare me, from the looks of your other comments you’re the definition of a blue pill. I wouldn’t be surprised if you think that Norway is a socialist utopia, that Biden is oh so non-corrupt and great, and that everybody should just have free college and pretty much everything for free. Oh and don’t forget, you must worship the “sCieNce” at all costs, except the science that disagrees with the democrats. You can stay shut inside forever, I really wouldn’t mind it.

        <p>You know what’s the nice thing about this sub? The fact we don’t outright ban you for having differing opinions. We’ll just debate you.. Some will call you names n’ stuff but that’s personally not me and I disagree with that method of dealing with raiders on this sub. </p>
<p>The biggest problem that people like you miss is the bigger picture. It’s called NO NEW NORMAL not the anti mask sub not anti this or kill everyone sub. We’re collectively against the governmental mandates of shutting down the economy and giving no sort of relief. Arrest business owners for keeping their places of business open, were against the whole being tracked and forced vaccines. </p>
<p>I’m not against vaccines as a whole- But for as fast as they cranked out this new vaccine and the government is basically saying these big pharma companies aren’t responsible for any sort of problems that may or may not happen down the future. And the whole carding people. That’s draconian bs straight out of 1984 and animal farm. </p>
<p>Everyone here is different in their opinions. Some people are more lax than me, some are more extreme than me. But overall we tend to have the same general overall idea. I won’t speak for anyone besides myself. </p>
<p>And Biden is not our president. Trump is still our president. Once Biden is sworn in on January 20th, then he will be our president. Trump is your president. </p>
<p>For the Americans here it’s the freedoms and rights that we have are slowly and subtly being stripped away despite us having the constitution. No where does it say these things are suspended because there’s a pandemic, it doesn’t work that way. </p>
<p>People like you want it to be simple and “ItZ JuSt a MaSK!” That’s all you see and you have your hive mind circle jerk backing up. You completely ignore the bigger picture.</p>

        <p>There is no bigger picture, you know why they have to keep bringing back restrictions? Because people refuse to do what they need to do to get the spread of this virus under control. 3000+ people died today, yet you're complaining about having to stay home. </p>
<p>I do agree the government needs to provide more financial relief, you can thank Mcconnel and the other ilk in DC for the constant stalling on another stimulus.</p>
