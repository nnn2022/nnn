    <strong>To ALL Doomers &amp; Covidians</strong>
    <p><p>There is no return to normal.</p>
<p>Government handouts and business closures mean you are RELIANT on the government, they no longer work for you, they own you. They feed your family. You are no longer self-sufficient. </p>
<p>The same billionaires a year ago you were calling out for being "greedy" are rinsing the lower/middle classes and turning over billions in extra profit at your expense whilst you stay home and save lives.</p>
<p>Have you forgotten that narratives and agendas can be bought? You knew this before the pandemic. What's changed? Have all people of power suddenly grew a moral compass in the last 12 months?</p>
<p>Do you understand the future precedent these infringements on basic human liberty sets for the future? This means that governments can enforce ANY draconian measures on their people at a whim on the things that only they would describe as a crisis, whether you agree or not.</p>
<p>COVID is real. But it doesn't warrant this response, ever. Please see passed the current narrative and never-ending goalpost shifting of COVID lockdowns and the matrix it presents for our future.</p>
<p>Take your vaccine but if you think that's going to set us back to normal take a long hard look at the shifts over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Read a history book.</p>
<p>Civilian safety is always the alibi of tyrants.</p></p>
