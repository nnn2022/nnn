        <p>Are you a bot? If so fuck off.</p>
<p>If not - you sound like a bot and should probably google Overton window - because they are using that against you with great success. </p>
<p>12 months ago you were free - and that freedom was a given and you didn’t have to submit to a health exam to have it. </p>
<p>This virus has a 99.99% survival rate  for children and young adults and 99.95 for middle aged people. </p>
<p>We don’t mass testing, we need freedom.</p>

        <p>&rt;Are you a bot? If so fuck off.</p>
<p>Uh no, I'm not a not bot lol. I'm the OP.</p>
<p>&rt;If not - you sound like a bot and should probably google Overton window - because they are using that against you with great success. </p>
<p>Not really because the Overton window has shifted beyond simply testing to lockdowns and restrictions which are less free. Unfortunately a lot of paranoid people do think lockdowns and restrictions are reasonable, and I'm trying to pull them back towards normality/liberty without sounding like we should do nothing. Its a game we have to play to get back to reason because the mass hysteria is dominating.</p>
<p>&rt;This virus has a 99.99% survival rate for children and young adults and a 99.95% for middle aged people.</p>
<p>Yeah that is just facts, but the rate begins to drops significantly over 60. LTC homes are a mess and part of the problem has been that PSWs weren't getting tested as often as they should of and visitors were being allowed in. Further, a lot of people live with their grandparents or have comorbidities so what about those who could potentially put their loved ones at higher risk? There are a lot of policies that can be done other than lockdowns to deal with all this and the spread, including mass testing.</p>
<p>&rt;We don't need mass testing, we need freedom.</p>
<p>Unfortunately freedom is just not gonna happen if nothing changes policy-wise that is still effective at curbing this virus. I want to preface that I think the lockdowns are absurd and significant government overreach. However, too many people are way too paranoid right now, and there needs to be some realpolitik involved to temper their fears. People are especially afraid of spreading it to their grandparents and seniors and I can sympathize with that. Politically nothing is going back to normal immediately, but we can try and get the radicals to calm down with compromised solutions.</p>
<p>I will take mass testing over lockdowns, which are heavy handed and do more harm than good. Although it is a compromise, sometimes you just got to take the deal even if its not ideal. Its politics. Mass testing and contact tracing can do more to preserve and restore our freedom, especially considering our current predicament in Ontario is worse. You cannot just do nothing because that will never fly politically, but we need to be reasonable in what we do so we don't destroy people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the epidemiologist in this interview is advocating for new spit-tests that were recently developed at McMaster University in Hamilton which can diagnose much faster and be more widely used. Furthermore, I maintain a position that the sensitivity on the current PCR tests are way too high and that the cycle thresholds should be lowered. I think we can do a lot to solve this pandemic without sacrificing our freedoms, but the public needs to be convinced that <em>something</em> is being done nonetheless.</p>
