    <strong>Separation of vaccinated and unvaccinated is already here - help me figure out what's coming next for this crazy world</strong>
    <p><p>Long-time lurker, prompted to post because my employer recently announced that unvaccinated employees would need to wear masks while the vaccinated can go mask-free. I was absolutely floored by the announcement, and then I saw that it’s happening all over the place! Clearly my employer is just going along with what society is doing, however crazy it is.</p>
<p>I’m not planning to get the vaccine, but I’m trying to figure out what the future might hold for society at large and how it will filter down to affect me and the masking. Wearing a mask for the rest of my life at work is not appealing, and is probably career suicide. Hear me out on the possibilities and let me know your thoughts.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>“Victory” declared over the summer and the media/gov/corp complex moves on</strong> The powers that be are pushing vaccines HARD, (scary, creepy hard) with all kinds of crazy incentives documented on this sub. Right now we seem to be in a phase where incentives are the norm, but what will they do when 10-20% of people remain unvaccinated. What are the chances they declare herd immunity is reached soon (maybe when we reach Biden’s 70%) and the CDC drops its masking requirements for everyone? This is my best-case scenario. I feel like it would have to happen before September, when cases will likely rise due to seasonality. If the CDC drops requirements for the unvaccinated to be masked, I think my employer and others would likely follow suit. <strong>Motivation: We need to get the economy going and keep the current people in power! Quick, get everyone back to work etc.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The unvaccinated become the new boogeyman and the gloves come off</strong>  The media/gov/corp complex is just having too much of a field day with the vaccine campaign and won’t let it go. Every last person must be vaccinated. And now the gloves come off for the holdouts. The creepy incentives remain in the background but become paired with more and more sticks. My heart fears this version. The mandatory mask discrimination seems like the first “pain point” directed at the non-vaxxed. In this scenario, the pain points would continue, culminating in either mandatory vaccination or increasingly onerous restrictions preventing people from participating in society (like widespread adoption of digital vaccine passports and even more forms of discrimination that I can’t imagine yet). <strong>Motivation: We need a new villain and too many people are still scared of COVID. No risk is acceptable. We can’t have ANY cases at ALL in the winter. It’s the fault of the unvaxxed!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Vaccine adverse effects finally reach the mainstream and manage to pause the push to vaccinate everyone walking the earth – masks are lifted for the unvaccinated shortly afterwards</strong> There are truly a LOT of stories on social media about vaccine adverse effects, along with concerning numbers in VAERS, and concerning scientific studies on biodistribution, spike protein, etc. These are all verboten, buried, and shunned at this time. BUT, that’s how the lab leak theory was for over a year too --- a censored conspiracy theory until it suddenly wasn't.</li>
</ol>
<p>The J&amp;J and AstraZeneca blood clots did burble up to the mainstream and become accepted as a <br>
true side effect. Why not all the stories associated with the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines? If the side <br>
effects are so prevalent, won’t there eventually be a critical mass of health care people who <br>
speak up, and won’t it eventually make it to the mainstream? I figure this would take up to a year <br>
from this spring – just my guess. <strong>Motivation: Uh oh, guess this is just too big to ignore so we</strong> <br>
<strong>better do something. [Insert name of authoritative media outlet] did a story, so now it’s real.</strong></p>
<p>All right – so there you have it – my three current theories on how things might play out. Which one do you think is most likely, and why? And are there any scenarios I’m not considering?</p></p>
