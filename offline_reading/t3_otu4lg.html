    <strong>Climate change all over the news</strong>
    <p><p>I was skeptical of the claim that climate lockdowns were coming. But the sheer amount of coverage in recent days makes it seem more likely to me. I'm not saying the evidence is hugely compelling, but the language used reminds me of early reporting on covid. Building a context of hopelessness and fear. </p>
<p>People are more susceptible to fearmongering than ever. The spirit of the majority has apparently been broken. Of course, we cannot be sure it <em>is</em> the majority - since MSM and social media produce a very skewed picture of reality.</p>
<p>Either way, I'm tentatively calling it now - Climate lockdowns/restrictions are likely coming soon.</p></p>

        <p>Sure is funny how according to them our last year of lockdown changed nothing and somehow made things worse. They've been haarping on climate change for all my life and before that but nothings really changed and NOW, after a bunch of shutting down and not driving for the better part of a year, instant massive heat waves, the planet is boiling us alive?</p>

<p>Sigh. There's still so much denial in this sub, even spite of the evidence smacking everyone's faces. </p>
<p>And yes, there's been coverage of this kind for <strong>months</strong> already. Since last year, even. It's obvious to anyone who isn't a moron that they are gunning for climate lockdowns, just like it was obvious masks were coming back too.</p>

        <p>Well I've been following the news reasonably closely and to be honest it was not obvious to me that climate <em>lockdowns</em> were coming. It's still not obvious in fact. I can fully believe that repressive measures may come into effect but we'll see how it pans out.</p>

        <p>I honestly can't say for sure. </p>
<p>My <em>guess</em> is 2024 or 2025? This is mostly because the documents for the Event 201 test run states that the current "pandemic" would end around there. But then there's the SPARS "pandemic" that's supposed to start right after that in 2025.</p>
<p>My guess is they'll likely start doing those climate lockdowns likely anywhere from 2022 to 2030.</p>

        <p>I feel like it might happen as soon as this fall, reason being that wildfire season here in the West really ramps up around that time. It's already started with a bang this year. I've seen probably hundreds of articles linking the fires to climate change, with a really hyperbolic, alarmist tone. I think it will be soon.</p>
