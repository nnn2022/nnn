    <strong>While it might.</strong>
    <p><p>To the unthinking and to the sterile and to the incompetent, slovenly, inattentive and to the slap-dash; appear to be an unambiguous and an uncomplicated admonition - the term ‘stay safe’ will be discovered as not as that as any uncultured intuition might automatically fancy. Though proving here and now to be an easy subject nevertheless for conditioning into a resolution. We note firstly that ‘stay safe’ is not a scientific term. Instead, we admit that it is an ethical term. As such, the idea of what constitutes the meaning of the term ‘stay safe’; may be any such thing that the parties involved may desire. In that - they might naturally be supremely divergent and antithetical. Therefore there is no potential for any neutrality in any such production of the term in any intercourse. That is to say that the substance of the report - ‘stay safe’ is an exhortation (and inevitably so) to an ideological affiliation and not to any particular or specific action or strategy. In general ‘safety’ has been produced now into an exclusive concept very narrowly defined and without any scientific, philosophical, moral or ethical basis. This has been achieved in the universal disposal and negation of logic and reason. This is our Diabolism.</p></p>
