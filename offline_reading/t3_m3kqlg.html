        <p>For a 23 yo you depend on your mother way too much.</p>
<p>My mother &amp; I are soooooooo different politically we don't agree on pretty much anything political. I didn't 'lose my mother' to an ideology I don't accept. I still have my mother. She is a separate independent person with her own opinions. There is so much talk about 'accepting your kids as who they are' sometimes we forget parents have personalities too and they are not an extension of ourselves.</p>
<p>You don't have to deal with her being brainswashed. At 23 you don't have to deal with her at all. Get your own place, set your own rules, see her on your own terms.</p>
<p>Also, you can always have a better life in a shitty situation. Not everyone is suffering to the same degree. I am sure you can make adjustments to your life to adapt to this situation better. Trying to be better in a bad situation is not the same as accepting it or approving it. You can still hate the lockdowns and try to adapt to live with them at the same time.</p>
