    <strong>Desiring Security makes for weak societies</strong>
    <p><p>I came across an excerpt from a speech given by William C De Vane, Dean of Yale College, given to his graduating class in 1949. Seems highly topical, 70 years on:</p>
<p>&rt; Several periodicals of national circulation have described the graduating classes of 1949 as “primarily interested in seeking security.” The journalists tell us that security and the avoidance of risk are ends that loom foremost in your minds.</p>
<p>&rt; I would remind you that it was just one hundred years ago that Americans of every type and description invaded the West Coast in search of their fortunes, and formed the vanguard of a vast colonial movement which increased immeasurably the health and strength of this country. I would remind you that it was they and men like them that have brought this country to greatness. It was not men who sought security first, adventure and enterprise next, who built Yale.</p>
<p>&rt; I should say that if these periodicals are correct, if it is true that your attitudes lent weight to their conclusions, then Yale has failed. For Yale expects of her graduates something more than a sodden search for security. She would see in you something of the spirit and the drive of the forty-niners.</p>
<p>We need much more of this kind of thinking in our times.</p></p>
