    <strong>How will people be able to defend the concept of the flu disappearing because of the restrictions next winter?</strong>
    <p><p>Maybe I see things wrong but imo the popular idea of the flu being extremely low this year bc of the restrictions will be very hard to defend in the future. By estimates the german vaccination-schedule still won't be complete by then but pretty much all of the risk-group has been vaccinated by this point, while social-distancing and masks will still prevail, because the government is dead-set to keep those until the vaccinations are complete. So by their logic there should be an enormous drop of the mortality rate as both the flu and corona shouldn't be able to exist. How the hell will scientists be able to explain why the hospitals are still filling up as usual? They can't blame the deaths on corona as this would mean that the vaccinations are useless (remember vaccinations of the public very likely won't be complete at this point and refusal would skyrocket) but they also can't blame the flu as many people would start questioning how the flu-rate could rise this much in 2021 although the same restrictions of the flu-devoid-2020 are still in place. Will they just say that the flu in 2021 is so so bad that even masks and distancing can't contain it? Or will they open everything up by then to explain the flu-season?</p>
<p>Another way out of this would be to say that the new flu-wave is caused by a new virus for which we also need a vaccine for and another year(s) of lockdown but I can't for the life of me imagine that people will accept this after almost 2 years of this shit (could be wrong of course) There is of course the conspiracy-theory about how the vaccine will accelerate deaths in the next flu-season which will be blamed on a new virus (Covid-21) but I have no idea how they would be able to pull this off at this point. I'm baffled about how they will worm their way out of this. What do you think will happen?</p></p>

        <p>Easy, they just won't know about it. Next winter the media will happily ignore the fact that hospitals are full and near to overflowing, just like they are every year, and that nurses are breaking down in tears because of the never ending stream of people dying, just like they do every year. </p>
<p>Instead the media will focus on whatever the current trend is, probably some other BLM-esque idiocy or celebrity-drama or political "scandal" or whatever the current "save democracy overseas" war is (see, for example, the almost total media blackout about fledgling democracy Armenia's recent heartbreaking defeat and humiliation at the hands of the dictatorial and totalitarian states of Azerbaijan, Turkey and Russia. In a different covid-free timeline this six-week war would have been all over the front-pages of the internet). </p>
<p>And the reactive and populist politicians will go with the prevailing media flow and, once again, nobody will care about all the old and unhealthy people who will <em>still</em> be dying, of both flu and this new coronavirus, despite their vaccinations.</p>

        <p>How will they able to keep restrictions, surveillance and medical tyranny justified without daily updates about the icu, i don't think they are able to just turn their backs to the hospital-stats after doing nothing else but icu-horrorstories of a fucking year. Many people will still look up what is going on and if the vaccines did anything to the death-rate. I would be amazed if they are able to just make people forget about this.</p>

        <p>I agree that they are not going to be able to make people forget about this. Even at hospitals you have nurses like my cousin who are starting to push back against this hyperbole, asking why all this brouhaha for a virus that has an IFR of less than the average flu per year according to Johns Hopkins Hospital.</p>
<p>What is the usual amount of people who die from flu each year according to JHH? 400K per year. They are just undercounted because we do not test test test test test out the wazoo for the flu in people who die in respiratory distress in a normal year.</p>

        <p>Yes this would be a possibility, like I said, but I can't fathom people will go along with this, people are on the edge already, maybe in a few years they are able to pull it off again but not immediately after/during the vaccinations. If they do this next year people will just snap (but maybe that's plan idk)</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m just saying what my friend Iâ€™ve known for over a decade told me. This is what her dad and cousin who are French told her. I have no way of proving it, but they also said they were being stopped on the streets to show papers saying they could be out. They are all pretty worried. Her dad couldnâ€™t fly into the states to be with her either.</p>

        <p>Ah you didn't know? Few mainstream media articles have come out saying that the science behind the flu disappearing is because Covid killed the flu, beacuse the both are viruses and they fight for their hosts and Covid won. People are buying it.</p>
