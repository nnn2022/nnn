    <strong>Moderator of r/LockdownSkepticism bans TWICE (for two different reasons) a video of a Canadian Health Officer acknowledging that government covid19 restrictions (social distancing, lockdown, mask mandates) are NOT BASED ON SCIENCE. Then he throws sh*t on other skeptical subreddits like r/NoNewNormal</strong>
    <p><p>Hey there, folks. I make this post for everyone to be aware of who is who in reddit, to understand who are the true free speech and skeptical communities, and which are the gatekeepers trying to manipulate others into their hidden agendas. I know many people here is aware of that, but some others may not, so I want to help.</p>
<p>Yesterday I posted in this subreddit a video of a Canadian Government Health Officer acknowledging in public that government covid19 restrictions are not based on science of any kind. I post the video below, for you to see it if you haven't already.</p>
<p>https://reddit.com/link/l6ya43/video/r7ttly2jy2e61/player</p>
<p>This morning I decided to give it a try to r/LockdownSkepticism. Although all reddit knows by now how they are over there: <strong>these people criticizing the covid19 situation are the equivalent of Joe Biden criticizing globalism and corruption in Ukraine</strong>. But still, because it was just a plain video of a government official giving relevant information about lockdowns and stuff, I didn't think there was going to be an issue. I actually thought that it could be valuable information for their dying subreddit. I couldn't have been more wrong...</p>
<p>I posted it first with a catchy title, you know, exactly like the mainstream media likes to report lies and fake information about the fake virus, using words like "Shocking, Breaking, Outrage, etc." <strong>This was the reason that my post was censored the first time, the moderator didn't like the title... because he likes things in "sober" ways.</strong> Seems he is not aware that his handlers are taking all his rights away, so he likes to focus on these little things that not even my 90-year-old grandmother would pay attention to. Here is a <a href="https://i.ibb.co/fMsWdjr/Caption-1.jpg">caption</a> of his answer:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/v4ieinig03e61.jpg?width=1252&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7e87a366c1f6279713a52660777dbbf0140b4aa">The message says that I deleted the post because I deleted it after he blocked it. I deleted it then so I could repost the video in a new post.</a></p>
<p>I naively said to myself: "ok, maybe they are super sensitive to letters written in the internet, who am I to judge them, right?"... So I proceeded to create a new post, but this time without any caps or sensationalist headlines, simply putting the own words of the Canadian Health Officer. Also remember that the post has no content, only the video.</p>
<p>I thought it was going to be okay, but NOPE! I was wrong again. <strong>Now the problem was that he didn't like where the video was cut (apparently he wanted the whole press conference)</strong> and he justified himself by saying that the officer was going to add context after it, when it was clear that she was finishing the answer and what she said couldn't have been more clear. He also complained that the video didn't have a date.... WTF?....</p>
<p>Then, for absolutely no reason, he started to throw shit on other skeptical subreddits like r/NoNewNormal or r/CoronavirusCirclejerk. <strong>Seems like he is too BACK-hurt for some reason and he can't help himself from throwing shit on people who do a better job than him</strong>. Then I got slightly angry and told him what he deserved, but knowing how sensitive he is, maybe I shouldn't have, poor kid.... here is the <a href="https://i.ibb.co/hg6qQfx/caption-2.png">caption</a>:</p>

<p>Have a good one, guys!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>PD: Enjoy the lovely parade of troll accounts sent by</strong> r/LockdownSkepticism <strong>in the comments and to make downvotes on the post. They are hilarious.</strong></p></p>

        <p>Sometimes I find lockdownskepticism to be a tad too strict, but that's not a bad thing. Its important to have a more rigid sub with higher standards that is harder to scrutinize. Sometimes I find nonewnormal to be too loose and accepting of fringe content that makes us look crazy sometimes. Both subs serve their purpose.</p>

        <p>they're political gatekeepers unwilling to float conversation of masks. It's a classic reddit formula, Grant a meaningless concession ("Lockdowns are bad") and then refuse to let conversation advance past it. They've platformed high profile mask advocates even lately, It is so obvious they are controlled op at this point</p>

        <p>Totally bro. The funny thing is that people, at this point, can see beyond the lies. I've met people over 60 years old, who only consume mainstream media, saying that this is all fake... these controlled shills are literally embracing a granade about to blow.</p>

        <p>For free speech to be a thing, you have to allow for conspiracy theories. That’s just a fact. </p>
<p>The problem on social media is that these kinds of voices get amplified and they tend to drown out the truth, which is often somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Don’t forget we are all on the same team. All 3 anti-lockdown subs. The three subs just go about putting out the same message in very different ways. I think that’s a great way to do it personally. </p>
<p>You have a sub that more or less sticks to the science, a sub that is more open and gets more into the politics, and a sub that just makes fun of everything. Obviously there is some overlap, but all three subs are necessary.</p>

        <p>And you actually feel entitled to know what it is the truth or not for everyone else? Let the information FLOW FREELY and then people will make their own minds. There are only two main anti scandemic subs, this one and r/CoronavirusCirclejerk. The one you came to defend is nothing but a shill gatekeeper. It's no coincidence that the sub you come to defend has the reputation that is has, of censoring, banning and controlling the narrative. They are just a government dog, barking from a leash.  </p>
<p>You or the m0r0n at r/LockdownSkepticism are no one's dad to be filtering what others can see or not. By the way, THIS WAS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL MAKING AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT, no conspiracy theory here, dimwit.</p>

        <p>Not everything's a conspiracy. They just have (unreasonably?) high standards for evidence. His criticism of the video - that it cuts off before context - is factually true, and it's something critics could seize upon to discredit us.</p>

        <p>Bruh... no, it is not.</p>
<p>It is called trying to censor people and silence people who have positions that you dislike.</p>
<p>It is a violation of human rights free speech. Something that should be respected even online.</p>

        <p>What is with redditors' obsession with the age of accounts? I make a new account every 2 or 3 months specifically to avoid doxxing and psychos who sift through post histories.</p>
<p>Does how long ago I switched accounts have any bearing on anything? If anything, I'd be more weary of the ancient accounts. Anyone with that much dedication as a redditor is not to be trusted.</p>

        <p>Age of accounts is a BIG sign of whether an account is a bot or not.</p>
<p>If an account is very new and starts posting various stuff, it is a tell that "Yes, this is a bot and we should ignore it!"</p>
