    <strong>Am I the only one who finds it incredibly sad how human interaction is going to be seen as something to be feared and avoided for a long time to come?</strong>
    <p><p>Now, I myself am a loner and introvert who is not fond of crowds.</p>
<p>But for people who do enjoy that sort of thing: travel, shopping, conventions, concerts, sports, bars, etc. How sad is it that social interaction, that human connection, of being with other people and sharing in something you enjoy and experiencing it together--- that's likely out the window for quite a while even after the vaccine has arrived and it's safer to congregate. Because people will be afraid. We see each other not as human beings, friends, family, neighbors, etc., but as walking disease carriers. Dangerous to be around, forbidden to touch or to breathe the same air. Gathering in a crowd will be seen as unspeakable. Even after people do feel safe enough to attempt it, you can bet masks and social distancing are here to stay for good.</p>
<p>Things like sex and kissing are disgusting now. Hugs, shaking hands, affectionate touch. Again, a form of human/emotional connection. Unthinkable nowadays. (I understand if you don't like being touched- I don't really- but I do not speak for other people).</p>
<p>And this pandemic has caused so much death, wreaked so much havoc, I don't see how normal life will go on in the same form it did since the beginning of time. People are terrified, of each other and the outside world. And I don't see that fear going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>No, human interaction will mostly be virtual. Over the computer or smartphone. Now that streaming movies is the future, theaters are on their way out too- another communal experience potentially lost forever.</p>
<p>I dunno, I just find it all so very disheartening. Does anyone agree with me, or am I making a mountain out of a molehill?</p></p>

        <p>I agree with you. It’s my number one fear of this whole thing and has been since day one. It’s what makes me depressed daily, as I’ve been trying to explain to my mother for a long time. </p>
<p>She thinks I’m just mad that I don’t get to do anything fun anymore (which, yes, I am, but that’s just the smallest tiniest bit of it. I’m not whining about not getting to do stuff.) What is really sucking my soul is exactly what you have written here and the pain I feel knowing that spontaneous and free human connection is essentially destroyed. </p>
<p>And for some reason, no one seems to be thinking about these long term effects of what we are doing to ourselves.</p>

        <p>This is what I keep saying... the response to "It's just a mask. It's easy".</p>
<p>Yes, okay. It is EASY to wear a mask. The thing is the mask is the sign we all wear on our face to remind everyone else to keep being scared.</p>

        <p>Lack of human contact is a recognised torture technique. 'Only virtual' isn't a concession - it is a punishment Italy reserves for mafia bosses.</p>
<p>But are people <em>really</em> that terrified? Around here (south of England), no-one takes restrictions even a bit seriously. Masks lasted a total of three months. The tier system is...well, still there...probably? Who knows? Police can't enforce a bike lock, let alone dictates they don't know. It's a joke.</p>

        <p>here in Connecticut, USA, at least near Hartford, it's been like 99% mask compliance. Indoors in stores it's 100%. Outdoors is maybe 80%, still many who mask, but there's some who don't when outdoors. Still too much sheeple falling in line here or being doomers...</p>

        <p>You are very lucky, I envy those who live in areas that are so lenient and mask free. 
I can't stand wearing those muzzles so I finally decided to buy a face shield to compromise. At least I can breathe in one and it's enough to slip past the mask policies at most places I've been to so far. And I've been the only one I've ever seen around wearing only a face shield. Most wear the disposable medical masks, some wear cloth.</p>

        <p>I'm in rural Denmark and everyone wears it. I'm the only one in the shop not wearing one, and people look at me like I have ten heads. Since the mandate, I've seen dozens of people wear masks in their cars, on the street, walking their dogs, and on their bikes. I've even had a mask-wearing classmate literally throw a tantrum before the mandate because the teacher wouldn't keep the doors and windows wide open when we were all freezing. People here have lost the fucking plot.</p>

        <p>Isolating people -- whole countries even - from each other, is explicitly part of the goal. See, here's the problem. When people are united, they are strong; and there is no single greater force to unite us, than shared cause, shared experience, and shared pain, and these things *necessarily* require physical presence. It is much, much, much harder for the human animal to form the bonds of mutual defense and protection, without physical interaction.</p>
<p>And that's where all the isolation comes in. Make people alone in their homes, watching the same content from the same sources saying the same things, prevented from interacting or communicating or planning together, and you have a populace that will not only be docile and subservient, they will also be incapable of ever rising up against you.</p>
<p>That was the ultimate purpose of all this. Not to microchip people with vaccines, not even the vaccine itself, except as a means to demonstrate to people that they have no power.</p>
<p>Now, I think the "powers that be" that have been planning this for decades have severely underestimated humans and overestimated their own ability to suppress natural human behavior and instinct. I think they will fail, and I think they will do so violently and spectacularly and the price will be quite high - but they will fail.</p>
<p>But not before a very, great many people suffer for it.</p>

<p>When this first started I was doing some shopping at my usual supermarket. Masks were just starting to become a thing. We had no orders or mandates yet.</p>
<p>I was walking through the open produce section where a masked mother about my age and her masked toddler daughter in the cart were rolling kitty corner to me about 10 feet away. The little girl looked at my unmasked face and an expression of absolute terror came across her eyes.</p>
<p>I felt so bad, her little girl is going to grow up thinking people are dirty and evil for not being masked sheep. It breaks my heart.</p>

        <p>From reading a lot of what the other side says, it seems like they assume anyone not wearing a mask is going to just try to cough all over them.
Umm is basic hygiene not a thing to most people?
Cough or sneeze into your elbow and facing downwards. Pretty sure it will stop anything better than a flimsy mask.</p>
<p>To be that brainwashed by MSM are they also like actually dumb and gross enough to have pre covid just sneezed/coughed straight into the air? So they now see their own gross behaviour as what everyone does so masks equal safe and no mask equals bioterrorism???</p>
<p>How have people gone so batshit crazy with how they see other people!?</p>
<p>P.s love you all. Thanks for keeping me somewhat sane. My lockdown suicidal self felt better coming here and knowing I was the one being gaslit.</p>

        <p>Right? Today I was on Twitter (yeah, I know), and saw all these tweets saying stuff like ‘I can’t believe we would just go to the store and let people breathe all over you’ and ‘even once there’s a vaccine and it’s safe to be out I’m still wearing a mask bc people are disgusting’ just makes me wanna scream into the void. First, most people are pretty good about not coughing or sneezing directly on you (adults, anyway). Second, viewing people as disgusting beings with no contexts sounds like an incredibly dangerous path right now.</p>

<p>When people possess so much fear at the personal contact level, we are unable to form bonds or connections with others subsequently we become obsessed with monitoring and reporting other's indiscretions, and consequently, this fear almost completely eliminates the public from threatening their control over us, because we are incapable of uniting and organizing any type of rebellion.</p>

        <p>That's what I have been saying since the first restrictions on bars... Think about it it was gentlemen sitting around in pubs that planned the revolution against the british. They don't want conversations about what is going on, PERIOD. They want everyone isolated and getting their news from "trusted" sources to hear about the latest "cases" and "restrictions."</p>

        <p>Don't overthink this stuff. From my own experience, almost all doomers are undesirable people and that's a VERY important fact to consider. There is going to be a huge wave that will flock into the public once everything opens up and they will start socializing. I can even see this behaviour in myself. I was never a very social person but all of a sudden I CAN'T WAIT until the gyms open up so I can talk to random people in there. And this goes for so many other activities as well. And trust me on that one, those people that actually DO socialize will become that much more attractive in the coming years. Everyone is already fed up with the distancing and those that will actually show up in those social environments will be that much more open for conversation and interaction.    <br>
I'm actually kind of looking forward to this, knowing fully well that the doomers will remain at home living their miserable, safe existence, staring at screens. It'll be easier than ever before to make new friendships because the people that matter are actually that much easier to identify. It's a weird thing to say, but I'm almost glad this new filter that removes all the idiots wasting my time from my life exists now.</p>

<p>I agree completely. You already see how the unmuzzled are dehumanized as "plague rats" who are "murdering granny." I remember some Canadian bigshot today or yesterday insinuating that people who don't get the jab "could" become second-class citizens basically.</p>

<p>Ya I can imagine that.</p>
<p>I just feel like the entire right-wing/conspiracy/nationalism thing is just kind of being all wrapped up together, then to be "jettisoned" as the rest of the world just moves forward. And there will be enough goodies in the Great Reset that many people will be happy to not look back.</p>

        <p>Oh it's even better. They want to give it to those at risk first. And guess what happens now that everybody has become aware that people actually die all the time? The German CDC equivalent already released a statement that thousands of people are going to die after receiving the vaccine only this time they care about who dies from it vs who dies with it.

<p>Yes I saw this in a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/04/health/coronavirus-vaccine-acip-nursing-homes-question/index.html">CNN article</a> too.</p>
<p>&rt;When shots begin to go into arms of residents, Moore said Americans need to understand that deaths may occur that won't necessarily have anything to do with the vaccine.
&rt;<br>
&rt;"We would not at all be surprised to see, coincidentally, vaccination happening and then having someone pass away a short time after they receive a vaccine, not because it has anything to do with the vaccination but just because that's the place where people at the end of their lives reside," Moore said.
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>"One of the things we want to make sure people understand is that they should not be unnecessarily alarmed if there are reports, once we start vaccinating, of someone or multiple people dying within a day or two of their vaccination who are residents of a long-term care facility. That would be something we would expect, as a normal occurrence, because people die frequently in nursing homes."</em></p>
<p>I mean .. of course NOW they want you to tell the difference.</p>
<p>.. it's all so surreal, isn't it?</p>
<p>I dont know where you are with conspiracy thinking ..</p>
<p>Because we have this untested vaccine, being injected into seniors ..</p>
<p>And once they get it, it has a "kick". Or it can make them sick. Sometimes <em>very</em> sick.  It doesnt take much to kill an 82yr old.</p>
<p>OR .. maybe they are one of the 15% of people who it doesnt protect?  And then they get Covid and die.</p>
<p>OR .. maybe the vaccine itself is EVIL .. and it kills them!</p>
<p>Nobody is going to know!  Nobody will be able to <em>prove</em> why/how a senior died.</p>
<p>Maybe the seniors are the "human testing phase"?</p>

        <p>I find this the most terrifying part of all, especially for the kids. There’s a generation coming up that believe that human faces aren’t meant to be seen in public, that touching or even getting near others is scary, that other people aren’t prospective friends but vehicles for disease. School isn’t a place to make friends...but then again, no place is. How these kids will be as adults is a frightening thing to think about. Even if at some point in the future, things try to return to normal, people are already convinced they need to fear each other and that isn’t going to magically change. Even the majority of adults, I fear, are turned for good, and the kids, especially the very small ones, are already programmed.</p>

        <p>I think you are looking too much into it. As an introvert who is 100% for masks during the pandemic, I still think things are looking good just up ahead. We have multiple vaccines coming, the more people take the vaccine the faster this will be more under control. I don’t think we will need to continue to wear masks once its under control, but we need to until then. I’m sure crowds will be a thing again eventually also. We are not always in a pandemic, it’s not going to last forever. More will be learned about this and more stuff will come out to treat it.</p>
<p>So just hang in there for now :)</p>

        <p>I agree and you're not the only one. I'm really not looking forward to having to deal with the lasting after effects of this scamdemic pretty much destroying our humanity and making people fear each other. It's downright depressing. I just want to return to normal life but nope, it's gonna be years of dealing with people being paranoid and too afraid to be close anymore. I'm not scared, but too many people have taken the fear porn hook, line, and sinker and won't let go of it.</p>
<p>edit: forgot to include and mention, one of my IRL friends has been so brainwashed by all this, when I did get to see her some months ago, she was too afraid to even hug me, paranoid that she'd be infected with the virus and spread it to her frail grandmother and immune compromised stepmom. I mean, it's a valid concern, but I clearly was NOT sick, I am healthy, not carrying any disease. So it kinda stung that she was too afraid of such contact, all because of this scamdemic BS.</p>

        <p>Some of them are probably doing it out of fear, not because they find you disgusting or whatever. If someone screamed at me just once for getting too close I'd probably avoid getting near people for months due to my anxiety. If we all knew how people around us really felt about all this we'd find out there are a lot more normal people and things are a lot less extreme.</p>

        <p>I see some articles that now say that breathing makes you a potential serial killer. </p>
<p>I’m not completely against mitigation measures right now when there’s an active pandemic, but We’re really in for a depressing future since even with the vaccine, the fear won’t go away. Hugs will be seen as disgusting for a long time, handshakes will likely go away completely, and a lot of people will probably practice some level of social distancing if there’s a 1% chance it’ll protect their families.</p>

        <p>Online dating will be the only way for people to find dates for a while, and even then, unless you're conservative/christian-leaning, you're probably gonna only get dates with doomers who won't want any physical interaction at all until a few months later and with constant negative Covid tests.</p>

        <p>If online dating is the way of the future, then humanity is fucked. Online dating doesn't work for the average man, because it robs us of our most essential weapon: confidence. Any pimple-faced loser can say, "hey, baby" online, but the subtleties of non-textual communication are completely lost in cyberspace. I've only ever been able to get with women in real life, and if they're all gonna hide their faces and social distance, then it's kinda hard to get something going...</p>

        <p>&rt;We see each other not as human beings, friends, family, neighbors, etc., but as walking disease carriers. Dangerous to be around, forbidden to touch or to breathe the same air. Gathering in a crowd will be seen as unspeakable. Even after people do feel safe enough to attempt it, you can bet masks and social distancing are here to stay for good.</p>
<p>&rt;Things like sex and kissing are disgusting now. Hugs, shaking hands, affectionate touch. </p>
<p>Nobody worth getting to know thinks ANY of what you've said here though. You seem to be under the impression that social media bots are people... They aren't. And the handful of real breathing humans that have fallen for this obvious fraud are so broken, and so intellectually stunted, they shouldn't be counted as humans anymore. Pity them if you must, but cut them out of your life because nothing good can come from keeping them in your circle. Nothing.</p>

        <p>This is one of the main agendas at play here actually, the breakdown of all traditional human interaction. I'm on the introvert spectrum myself but the extroverted end of it. Things have already being conditioned to make people feel this way about others because when everyone fears everyone else and there is no trust it's easier for big media, government, and pharma to step in be the only thing to trust. Social media networks aren't the most social places in the world now either and only sustain a hive mind mentality so they also had to play a huge role in the great social breakdown. Physical touch and affection is also going down especially because we can't have humans having something so essential and reminding of their own humanity at a time like this can we? It's as if we're being molded into a whole new species altogether I even now am starting to barely recognize.</p>

        <p>I wrote this earlier today on a different sub but I am really worried that people are now too far gone and now just view each other as nothing but disease carriers. I worry that people are going to be afraid of talking to people in person without masks because we may just transmit a disease to one another. I am also concerned that many people will only feel comfortable having a maskless conversation over Zoom or Facetime for a long time.</p>

        <p>Human interaction is not seen as something to be feared or avoided by me or anyone I even know, and it won't be any time in the foreseeable future. If anything the pushback will ensure there will be a ready supply of risk-loving friendly people for a long time to come that would never have been so radicalized otherwise.</p>

        <p>I don't know if this anti-human "social" distancing and face masking B.S. is going to be temporary or not, but I can tell you that even before 2020, for the last 10-20 years, human contact and physical touch has been rapidly declining, especially for young single men like myself, who have literally been starved of human touch. Girls, at least, can be touchy with each other, but in America there is a great, unspoken taboo against straight men touching each other and being affectionate in a fraternal sense. We can go months or even years without human touch beyond a simple handshake or a formal hug. I'm afraid this New Abnormal -- <em>if</em> it continues -- is going to make it damn near impossible for many men to find physical human connection, which could drastically increase suicide and life years lost in the near future.</p>

        <p>I found this sad for awhile starting back in March. At this point, I have such little tolerance and respect left for the morons who have allowed this to keep tout that I don’t care much anymore. I don’t really want a connection with the brain dead and spineless who have ushered in this tyranny and fucked up my life and so many others.</p>
<p>It’s sad, but it’s what the masses wanted evidently.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. I do think what people are doing is worse than covid itself. They just can’t think of that. In march or april everyone was terrified.. we had no idea if a quarter of the population would drop dead. But now? It’s no where near that bad and the virus has a pretty low fatality rate. So im not so scared of covid itself, im scared of people handling this and they really don’t seem to care what they’re doing and how our actual lives.. the things we looked forward to are just being thrown away.. people are gonna regret it. You may say i’m selfish for being an anti-lockdowner.. but it’s the opposite. I just don’t want to live in a dystopia over a virus that really doesn’t call for that.</p>

        <p>I agree with you, I fear this. Even when I never had much in terms of interaction other than talking. But it seems that this is their goal, to make us afraid of each other and then turn us against each other. And now, find a way to blame some small group and watch us tear each other apart instead of where it should be.</p>

        <p>I am more optimistic — I think that when enough people get vaccinated, or there’s herd immunity, or however it bottoms out, people will return to their normal routine. Hopefully any expert talk about how “nothing will be the same” is just that, talk that your average American could give a shit about.</p>

        <p>As an introvert, I’m completely okay with this shit. I want people to avoid me, I don’t want to shake peoples hands or hug them. I don’t want to talk to people and so on. It avoids the confrontation of me telling them to “fuck off” essentially. </p>
<p>As a libertarian, I’m far more worried about people accepting government over reach then I’ll ever care about people wanting to avoid others.</p>

        <p>I agree.</p>
<p>My coworker walked past me when I did not wear a mask even though I always say Hi and am friendly if I cross her for 2 seconds in the hallway.</p>
<p>After masks were mandated at work and I'm forced to wear one in the hallway, she says Hi to me now. </p>
<p>Fuck that, it's too late to be civil now. I ain't saying Hi back.</p>

        <p>I think this is part of the reason why we're forced to go through this mess.</p>
<p>"Unity makes strength" is a motto that has been used by various states and entities throughout history. It is used by Bulgaria and Haiti on their coats of arms and is the national motto of Belgium, Bolivia, Georgia and Bulgaria. This is such a common motto because it's commonly understood that humans are much stronger when standing united for or against any cause.</p>
<p>We're weaker when we are divided and afraid of our fellow human being. This in turn allows the <a href="https://johnslegers.medium.com/connecting-the-dots-between-covid-19-and-the-not-so-great-reset-798e8ba7d95">"technocrats" of the WEF and IMF to step in</a> and micro-manage our lives with us being barely able to resist. And that, I believe, is where all this it leading us to...</p>
