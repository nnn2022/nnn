    <strong>The "Cure" Is Worse Than The Disease</strong>
    <p><p>It fucking baffles me that people are more afraid of a fucking meme virus they have a 99.7% chance of surviving from (and that's if they even get it in the first place) than they are of a fucking rushed, experimental vaccine full of God knows what being injected into them. Absolutely insane if you ask me.</p>
<p>Seeing and hearing all these horror stories coming out about the adverse side effects and deaths makes me feel like I'm watching a car pile-up in slow motion, helplessly unable to do anything to stop it from happening. I'm honestly fucking terrified about what's going to happen next and where this is all going to end up: Children of Men or I Am Legend?</p>
<p>I realize I'm being a bit of a doomer myself here but fuck, after the hysteria displayed this past year by you flailing fuck-tards this is nothing in comparison. I have a colleague who legitimately believes we will all die of Covid if we lift the restrictions too quickly and another acquaintance who's barely left his fucking room for the past year, and that's just two examples of the clownish lunacy and hysterical paranoia on display from you face-diaper wearing piss-ants.</p>
<p>People are so desperate to get back to normal, do their part, or get internet points by virtue-signaling that they're rushing out to get pumped full of something they've done zero research into beyond "government, Scientists and media say it's good so it must be"! And these are the same people that have been screeching for an entire year about how much they care about their fucking health! What a fucking joke!</p>
<p>I hope I'm fucking wrong, really! I want to get back to normal, that's my whole fucking reason for being on here! But these things need to be talked about and discussed, and there's a great deal of censorship and outright denial going on around this issue in the media, science and, unsurprisingly, in other subreddits that is really setting alarm bells off in my head. I don't think people are going into this with all the facts and I'm really concerned there's going to be dire consequences (and for many, as we've seen, there already are).</p></p>

        <p>This virus is sold as the worst thing since bubonic plague. When for more people it’s just mild flu. We don’t need to shut down the whole world to accommodate the 15% vulnerable. Those are the only ones that need to mask and stay away from people.</p>
<p>Even people like me with metabolic disorder that doctors recommended that I get regular flu shots every year after getting badly sick one year aren’t in terrible danger because I am  healthy for 33. </p>
<p>This is a scare campaign for government to grab power. Especially in Canada... that leaked email has been on schedule.</p>

        <p>Not for most, it is not. For me personally and my mother who died from it (more due to medical negligence than the virus itself)? Yeah, it was bad.</p>
<p>Most people however got barely the sniffles from it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I was really anxious back when it looked like covid had a 10% death rate.  Even 5% or 2% would have been kind of scary.  Then I did the math a year later and realized my age group only had a 0.05% chance of death and I went months without leaving my house for no reason.</p>
<p>I started to go outside more and shop. Still fine.  Still haven't even caught covid in a year.  Everyone I know who got it survived without even any major problems.  One of those people was an 85 year old woman too, who actually was in the danger zone for it.</p>
<p>Everyone else is still just living in panic mode constantly.  I hope they wake up and realize the world isn't ending soon.</p>

        <p>I feel the same way. How people blindly unconditionally trust and abide by everything Fauci and the media says is beyond me. It's really like they have been programmed. </p>
<p>As for where this all leads... </p>

<p>The very second lockdowns for the coof were put onto the table, I told every last one of my family members that the "cure" was going to be worse than the meme disease by far.</p>
<p>Of course, since Orange Emmanuel Goldstein said something along those lines, lockdowns, CCP-style dictatorships, and new abnormals are the greatest thing since sliced bread. Damned fools.</p>

        <p>Please compare your “99,7% survival rate” (3000 deaths per million) against the &rt;99,9999% survival rate of the vaccine (less than 1 death per million). If the media would report every covid-19 death case, it would massively outnumber the deaths caused by covid-19. The media is clearly spreading fear, since it simply sells. </p>
