    <strong>Is there any evidence that covid can be in the body for up to two weeks before symptoms?</strong>
    <p><p>Long story short I work in a health facility and told my coworker that she had given me covid uncouple months back. I had symptoms but they were extremely mild. I said the period between contact and symptoms (if any) is 3 to 5 days. Mu boss says its 2 weeks and that he is going off of the same sources the RNs use. Is there <em>anything</em> that corroborates that?</p></p>
