    <strong>My co-worker is Cathy Newman</strong>
    <p><p>A co-worker suggested getting the jab together, to which I responded with what I thought was my more socially-acceptable reply- that I was waiting for the moth shot (Novavax, cultured in moth cells) since it is more traditional. Another co-worker came from the other room and interjected - "So you're saying you're anti-vaxx?"</p>
<p>It got worse. As I explained that the tech is more tried and tested I got "Why would you want that over the mRNA??". Then, as I stated that I am waiting on there to be ANY long term data before being a test subject (surprising this was admitted on their end), I got "So rather than be test subject for vaccine you'd rather be a test subject for the Delta variant??". I couldn't even beyond that and just dropped it.</p>
<p>The first co-worker, who still is all for the vax as seem more sensitive/swayed by others (e.g. suggesting we don't use the term gypsy moth because a social justice post said it was derogatory), showed some sense in admitting problems appear down the line for many drugs too. I might also use the rationale that I'll consider Novavax to become the Mothman. I'm still skeptical of it as well; I had just read a bit on it earlier so it was in my head to throw out as my rationale for not rushing to get my jab appointment like it's the concert of the century.</p></p>

        <p>Could you explain hoe the Novavax is more traditional?  It seems to me like it's more of this spike protein nonsense</p>
