    <strong>Schoolteachers Teaching in the Virtual Setting</strong>
    <p><p>I believe that the reason why the teachers want this trend of teaching online to continue is because they are no longer getting assaulted by students on a daily basis. At least not physically. Seriously, I have never wanted to be a teacher although some of my college professors suggested I become one in the mid-90s (art and graphic design). Why? Because around that time, classrooms became literal fucking zoos. A student can sucker-punch their 70-year-old science teacher, it will be all over the news, and he will receive no discipline at home; therefore, the state arrests him (as they should). </p>

        <p>I also like your "Homeless Criminals Attacking Civilians" playlist but thought your playlist of 110 videos of "Fartin' and Diarrhea" is strange lol.</p>

        <p>I never thought of this side of it either. That’s not even a thing where I am but I can see it in the cities. I hate to see this. I know a career change is not easy but there is also nobody handcuffing these teachers to a desk and forcing them to keep their jobs. This whole attitude toward suddenly thinking work from home is an option is maddening. It would be like a bunch of electrical linemen got together and stopped going to work and told their union reps they aren’t really into working with high voltage electricity since they don’t feel safe and it has a potential to be dangerous.</p>
