    <strong>Died with Cannabis in your system? It’s one of the safest drugs! Died with COVID-19 “in your system”? It’s one of the deadliest diseases!</strong>
    <p><p>You cannot want weed to be legal AND want lockdowns to continue without employing the Orwellian art of doublethink.</p>
<p>As I enjoy this good kush I reflect upon the many idiotic hypocrisies of NPCs — I was wondering how much a lethal dose of cannabis is, turns out it’s really difficult to kill someone with marijuana, so it’s really hard to answer that question. But the article I read said there haven’t been any recorded cases of deaths caused by cannabis. It’s actually one of the safest drugs you could ever ingest.</p>
<p>However my wife said “I bet it’s in a ton of people’s systems when they died”. She’s totally right, and I immediately thought “if I was a dishonest person, then I might use that to demonize cannabis — I’m sure they probably have already!”</p>
<p>Then I realized this is the same argument pro lockdowners use. </p>
<p>Somehow when an obese smoker who never goes outside, or a 90 year old woman who would’ve died from a cold, dies and they find COVID in their system, then that must mean it’s the deadliest disease on the planet!</p>
<p>But if you get high and die, if you get high and do day to day activities and crash your car, dying on impact, and they find THC in your body, then that means Cannabis is the SAFEST DRUG on the planet.</p>
<p>You can make good choices and smoke Cannabis, or, you can get super high and drink a little and then drive home and kill someone on the highway.</p>
<p>IMO Drugs are illegal for the same reason COVID is considered “dangerous”:</p>
<p>People who make bad choices ruin everything for people who make good choices.</p>
<p>Stupid people who blindly follow rules and are easily frightened (prey/sheep) are easily controlled by the smart people who know how to wield your own fear as a sort of magic spell (predators/politicians) in order to create the rules for you, that you must follow, in order to not become prey, this whole cycle IS the hunt.</p>
<p>And stupid people who want to be considered good and don’t want to believe people are responsible for their own lives have to save the prey from themselves, but they cannot avoid becoming the agents of the predators. They ask for these rules. They actually crave them.</p>
<p>The Lions roar, itself loud but harmless, frightens the Gazelle into fleeing for safety, along predictable paths and reacting in predictable ways, once the fight or flight reaction is triggered, thinking stops, just react to stimulus. You are in a maze created by these Lions, where the walls are not even solid, they are made out of fear, not danger, just fear. </p>
<p>There’s even medical exemption cards that people want to get to avoid mask mandates just like medical marijuana cards.</p></p>

        <p><strong>Exactly! It is seemingly coded in a way that allows the highest number to be achieved,</strong> which is the opposite of how diseases and deaths are coded...hell, medical errors are coded in the EXACT OPPOSITE manner.</p>
<p>The fact that the coding itself allows assumptions to take priority for Covid, yet "medical errors leading to death" aren't listed and are instead labeled as the underlying cause of death even when it wasn't the cause... </p>
<ul>
<li><em>it makes me take pause and wonder why that is, and why anyone should ever trust a doctor</em>, <strong>considering they account for the largest group of people causing death in America that are legally allowed to operate</strong>... <em>accounting for the 3^rd leading cause of death every year:</em></li>
</ul>
<p>https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/05/03/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death/</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Covid, a "pandemic worthy" virus can be diagnosed with assumptions, inflating totals and causing unreasonable restrictions and fear</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Medical Errors, the 3^rd leading cause of death every year, is a hidden statistic and fradulently recorded as the underlying issue, even if it wasn't the cause of death</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[Sourced Below]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Covid Coding</strong></p>
<p>https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/covid19/en/</p>
<p>&rt;An emergency ICD-10 code of ‘U07.2 COVID-19, virus not identified’ is assigned to a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 <strong>where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Both U07.1 and U07.2 <strong>may be used for mortality coding as cause of death.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Covid Guidelines to determine cases:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html</p>
<p><em>so a test is not required for a positive case or a Covid death statistic</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Covid Case Guidelines (Contact Tracing)</strong>
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/case-definition/2020/</li>
</ul>
<p>CSTE statement <em>was</em> Interim-20-ID-01:</p>
<p>https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19_NO.pdf</p>
<ul>
<li>Which states: "CSTE will assume all targets during contact tracing are asymptomatic and thus be counted as a positive case"</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(Since, they have switched to Interim-20-ID-<strong>02</strong>:</em>)</p>
<p>https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf</p>
<ul>
<li><em>which states the same thing</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>so basically you can be diagnosed at anytime without a test, which is the</em>  <strong>opposite of how medical errors are coded:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Medical Error Coding</strong></p>
<p>https://www.propublica.org/article/study-urges-cdc-to-revise-count-of-deaths-from-medical-error</p>
<p>&rt;Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch for the CDC, disputed that the agency’s coding is the problem. He said complications from medical care are listed on death certificates, and that codes do capture them. The CDC’s published mortality statistics, however, count only the “underlying cause of death,” defined as the condition that led a person to seek treatment.
<strong>As a result, even if a doctor does list medical errors on a death certificate, they are not included in the published totals. Only the underlying condition, such as heart disease or cancer, is counted, even when it isn’t fatal.</strong></p>
<p>https://www.advocateslaw.com/medical-malpractice-medical-coding/</p>
<p><em>ICD codes are used which do not account for human error, just the diagnosis of the patient...which is why the medical error statistics are hidden, as there is no code for medical malpractice</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Which is interesting b/c the 4 D's of malpractice are duty, derelection, damages, direct cause...which have all been approached and crossed during the pandemic. From delayed treatments to improper ventilator usage, to misdiagnoses and assumptions. <em>Doctors are people too, idk why everyone thinks they're infallible</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>exponentially more people have died due to lockdown than covid:</em></p>

<p>https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/record-number-of-healthcare-workers-laid-off-furloughed-during-pandemic.html</p>
<p>The media didn't help with the fear mongering propoganda portrayed, <em>especially once the pandemic became political,</em> which exacerbated the fear.</p>
<p><strong>We'd be dishonest to say those excess deaths are a majority Covid related, other than people avoiding care for fear of catching Covid19.</strong></p>

        <p>I just don't understand believing in something merely because it exists while ignoring the massive list of negatives. People just kneel over for a doctor yet ignore the kickbacks and other monetary incentives.</p>
<p>Take marijuana for instance. There are a plethora of studies showing it kills all 3 forms of breast cancer, yet it isn't introduced to the market because there aren't for-profit synthetic analogs made yet like other synthetic cannabinoids such as Marinol. </p>
<p>Yes, it's also federally illegal <em>(ignoring all of recorded history it was used as a medicine)</em>  due to it's threat to major textile industries in the past. Oddly, the government hands out medical marijuana through Compassionate Care IND, so idk how that hypocrisy flies when it's federally illegal. Why follow a law that the government doesn't follow themselves (like Covid lockdowns?). Healthcare is a for-profit industry, solidified by the HMO Act of 1973 that Nixon signed for his buddy Edgar Kaiser, then CEO of Kaiser Permanente.</p>

        <p>Here is a quick thought process for you:</p>
<p>https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/over-85-of-virus-patients-in-uk-asymptomatic-study/2000300
&rt;Over 85% of virus patients in UK asymptomatic: Study</p>
<p>If 85% of patients show no symptoms, then it stands to reason somewhere around 85% of those who die with covid in their systems are also asymptomatic.</p>
<p>So 85% of the deaths they claim are caused by Covid are people with no covid symptoms at all.</p>

        <p>I respectfully disagree.</p>
<p>the states with the strictest lockdowns and most adherent mask wearers are also the ones that “push for legalization” (CA, Oregon, Washington) which makes sense to me, because COVID is an auth left phenomenon.</p>
<p>The states that are most anti lock down (TX and FL) are also states where weed is (still) illegal.</p>
<p>“Pro weed = anti lockdown” is a bit of an over simplification. Imo</p>
<p>Many more people, on both sides, want weed to be legal in at least some form than you might think... it’s leaders who don’t actually represent us, on BOTH sides, which prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>Big pharma lobbying is real.</p>
<p>“They” (pro lock down pro weed folks) lack so much more than a sense of urgency, they lack critical thinking, consistency, and integrity. </p>
<p>Wanting to smoke weed and get high doesn’t automatically certify you as someone interested in human rights and liberty.</p>
<p>Weed can make you complacent, lazy, forgetful, and unmotivated. It’s a great medicine and recreational drug but it’s not without its negatives.</p>
<p>If you’re stoned all the time you’re not gonna fight against these lockdowns imo, if you want to render a society docile, you would want to give them soma ala Brave New World.</p>
<p>I’m not anti cannabis by any means, I enjoy it recreationally and medicinally, but it CAN be used improperly, abused, and as a tool to control the masses by keeping them high.</p>
<p>Personally, if I’m smoking too much, I simply can’t perform at work competently, or at the same level, and I’m unmotivated.</p>
<p>There is some truth to the Lazy Stoner stereo type unfortunately.</p>
