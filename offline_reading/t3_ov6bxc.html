    <strong>How the pandemic skewed the way I see my own sexuality.</strong>
    <p><p>i’ve been meaning to post this or something like it for a while. I am 16 years old and for most of my sophomore year of highschool we did school online. I hated this with all my being for obvious reasons like the 0 social interaction I had and being unable to have a single good grade and my parents yelling at me every day for said grades. late last year I unfortunately got into the habit of cutting my wrists because the depression really got to me. early this year I discovered that I am bisexual, at first I accepted it and was fine but over time the chronically anxious voice in my head that developed over quarantine started to tell me that I was either faking my bisexuality for attention or that I was so mentally fucked up by quarantine that I coped by just switching something about myself that I had thought I already knew well enough for so long. I know that sexuality isn’t a choice but I can’t get rid of that voice constantly telling me i’m just queer because of my environment. I haven’t even come out to the people i’m closest to even tho I know they would be 100% supportive because of that feeling. I also understand that my situation is no where near as bad as others who lost their entire livelihoods because of the lockdowns. and I am only 1 of millions of children (or just anyone) who have been mentally damaged by the lockdown and mandatory online schooling.</p>
<p>but hey, at least I didn’t get a cold for a week haha!</p></p>

        <p>I would highly implore you that you get off the internet and go take a walk or something. The widespread accessibility of the internet is the reason why things are the way they are now. That is why I hate the internet and think it is one of humanity's worst creations.</p>

<p>It's what you use it for that counts.</p>
<p>You can use it to strengthen the core family and not tell people lies about made up genders that only serve to deteriorate society.</p>
<p>I do not care if OP wants to self-remove from the gene pool.</p>
<p>I simply do not want a culture that actively encourages harmful and unnatural activities.</p>

        <p>The only unnatural activity I see in this post is your response to the OP. It is unnatural to judge and berate people for their personal choices that have zero effect on you personally. You are a high and mighty Bible thumper apparently, and pissing me off. You may be heterosexual, but you can still go fuck yourself.</p>

<p>Not true. Hedonism and depravity paved the way to this "new normal".</p>
<p>It doesn't take the bible to learn some wisdom and common sense, either.</p>
<p>There are societies that are functional and there are those that are dysfunctional. I was explaining the reasons behind the current  state of things, not making personal attacks on people.</p>
<p>As I said, there are bigger issues. But this is certainly one that ties into everything else. I am merely pointing that out. Political correctness is the death of free thought.</p>

        <p>People are being conditioned to desire the death of humanity.</p>
<p>Not only in this regard, the "green movement" is quite the same.</p>
<p>I am laying out a philosophy that is actually liberal and respectful towards all human life and you attack me for it. Think about that.</p>
<p>Again, I did not say you should not have the choice. I only said that actions have consequences and a gay couple will not fulfill the natural purpose of sexuality.</p>

<p>Do you think the current policies and the cultural nudging in society are in good balance with the number of people in this majority?</p>
<p>Are the 4% represented equivalently?</p>
<p>If not, then why is a minority dictating how the rest of society must talk and act and live? Who is using this minority to advance a different agenda entirely?</p>

        <p>Everything you just said is a contradiction. You believe that you and I and everyone else has the freedom to decide if they take the vaccine, distance, mask, etc. right?  You also believe that people should research every aspect of the pandemic, political reactions and the cause and end game of this farce right?  But you also believe that the sexual attraction of one person to another of the same sex is going to be the absolute downfall of society?  You do realize that every society since the beginning of time has had, brace yourself, <em>homosexuals</em>. These people were not the cause of the collapse of the Greeks or romans or any other society. I have known many family units destroyed by the unbridled lust of men for women and women for men but not a single one where the partner left for a same sex relation. Your bias is unfounded and you are a bigot. Take your bullshit elsewhere.</p>

<p>That is not what the LGBTQ movement is about. It is about exclusion and social deterioration. It is about intolerance. You think the woke gay bomber crews murdering people are great? They are murderers.</p>

        <p>I have never heard of a woke gay bomber crew but that sounds like something that showed up in one of your wet dreams. the only people who actually want to isolate lgtq people from anyone else are some of the elites who obviously i’m already against. the general normal public just wants peace and love</p>

<p>You think Big Pharma wants people to be free and happy and find self-fulfillment?</p>
<p>A socially constructed self is never a "true-self". You can be angry about that but you should rather be angry at the people who profit off of the misery they push on others.</p>

How the fuck else is someone supposed to get a personality if they have no social interaction at all. every single personality on earth is a “socially constructed” personality unless you were locked in a blank white void with no communication to you at all forever. every interaction you have shapes who you are!</p>

        <p>Let me spell out what this is really about:</p>
<p>Homosexuality, Transsexuality, etc. are being pushed for the political agenda of transhumanism.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is based on a mechanistic view of human beings. Man is a "hackable animal" to quote the WEF. Humanity is reduced to a bio machine that can be created, destroyed and manipulated at will.</p>
<p>The consequences of this philosophy are quite visible in "the new normal".</p>
<p>And the ultimate goal is a dystopia in which life has no meaning whatsoever.</p>
<p>You got stuck on all this surface level "gay rights, love, freedom, equality" talk.</p>
<p>Just look at what people actually do. Follow the money. You'll figure it out.</p>
<p>I, for one, do not hate anyone. We are all in this together and, I believe, more than the sum of our parts. No mere bio-machines to tinker with.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>Neither are the kids who die of cancer before puberty.</p>
<p>They leave the gene pool and enable others who are more resilient to seed the human race for the coming generations. I'd like to help them, if I could.</p>
<p>However, nature will not be trifled with.</p>
<p>I already said that the problem lies in the philosophy that wishes to usurp the natural order of things by replacing it with a dysfunctional culture that destroys the human species when left unchecked.</p>
<p>Technology must serve humanity, not enslave it and society must work to liberate the individual. The LGBTQ movement is the antithesis of that. All the misguided people who follow the insanity of imaginary genders are enslaved to a sexless, angry lifestyle that is harming themselves and others.</p>
<p>If objective reality is not your frame of reference, then you are wrong. It's that simple. If a minority of the population wants to pursue this kind of corruption, it has no right to force it on the rest of us. That is true intolerance.</p>

        <p>The threads here are wild. 
I'll just get straight to the point. Being a teenager is confusing and difficult, its the time of self discovery after all. And normally we don't have to sit with ourselves as much as we've had to this past year or so. And it's a very common experience for a lot of queer and trans kids to feel that they are faking it or that they've been societally conditioned into being queer because its the "new" "popular" thing to do, that somehow their environment is what made them think they were gay. Sometimes they even feel that they're just going crazy. We love impostor syndrome ay? And this is especially common for bisexuals, especially nowadays. Basically, all I'm telling you is the way you feel about your sexuality is completely normal and valid and you're nowhere near alone in dealing with it. I have and still am going through the same things. I'm sorry I can't really help you, but what I've found to help me is to tell myself that labels don't need to be permanent. I feel that I am bisexual now, that is the label I will go with for now. And its perfectly okay if it changes. It doesn't mean I was faking my feelings or that I was following a trend or that soCiEtY cONdiTIONed mE tO bE gAy (or even straight). It just meant I was figuring out who I was. And you are just figuring out who you are. Sorry if that doesn't help you at all. Its all super complicated and I'm still trying to figure things out for myself. Best of luck to you m8.</p>
