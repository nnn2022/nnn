    <p><p>I said the word "Pigs" near some Police Officers and they gave me a fixed penalty notice for being too far away from home. This has understandably caused me some distress, not to mention caused me to miss my train home to my family. I was hoping somebody could give me some (free) legal advice on what my rights are as an individual leaving my home and what kind of action I can take to oppose the fixed penalty notice. (UK)</p></p>

        <p>I dont think there is a distance in place. Unless your train journey was not essential, I cant see why they would be able to get away with that fine.</p>

        <p>What is defined as essential? Do you know where I can find what is determined as essential or not? Alcohol and grapes are still being sold and I cannot fathom how they can be deemed essential, so surely my trip out is also just as essential.</p>
<p>Grapes are nice, but how essential are they? Are they as essential as potatoes? Are they as essential as pain relief? I am positive we can all agree grapes are not essential.</p>

        <p>If you see this video clip,</p>
<p><a href="https://thehighwire.com/videos/the-toll-of-herd-stupidity/">https://thehighwire.com/videos/the-toll-of-herd-stupidity/</a></p>
<p>Around time 7:42 where Sir Desmond Swayne talks about the police behavior. There is no rule of what the police is doing. In fact it is illegal and it's not part of a democratic policy. That's what I understand. I would go all the way to the court for this. And bring up all the damages caused by the social control enforced.</p>
