    <strong>Serious Question: At what point do we shift our priority from making memes about masks to actually doing something productive?</strong>
    <p><p>Been following this sub since early summer and while I do enjoy it here I've got to say I'm becoming a little bit disappointed. I'll try to explain why in as few words as possible.</p>
<p>I'll start with an assertion re: the demographic of this sub - I'm assuming that we are all predominantly right-wing in terms of our ideologies and I'm assuming that there is a spectrum in terms of how radically the people here hold their beliefs. I also get the impression that most are from the US. I'll write with this audience in mind. In the early days of this sub it was a bit like it was now. There was lots of criticism of the left-wingers and their proclivity toward masks, lockdowns, etc. All great stuff, and in the early days of the "pandemic" I was right on board. It <em>seemed</em> in the beginning as though pushing back against the left would yield results. By pushing back I mean trying to red-pill people, refusing to wear masks in public, etc. just small shows of resistance against the government's agenda. </p>
<p>Well, here we are 6 months later <strong>and there is absolutely fuck all to show for it.</strong> All of our resistance has amounted to absolutely zero, and can you really be surprised? It's become ridiculously obvious over the past few months especially that your enemy isn't the Karen in the grocery store giving you a dirty look for not wearing a mask, but the government itself, and I can guarantee you that the government doesn't give the slightest fuck if you don't wear a mask to pick up your bread and milk.</p>
<p>I'm about to criticize the current state of this sub, so if you're the type to get easily offended I recommend that you stop reading here. There's this idea that we're "lions" or "wolves" and the left/mask-wearers are "sheep". That's fucking cringe as shit first of all but even more importantly it's all talk. You're not a brave lion for not wearing a mask in a store lmao. I'm not saying that because I think it's wrong not to wear a mask, I don't wear a mask, but I'm not sitting here jerking off my ego because of it. The fact is that not wearing a mask is merely <strong>a baby step in the right direction and not the end game</strong>. As I said earlier, the government doesn't give a fuck. Continue to not wear masks, but understand that at best (or worst depending on your frame of reference and definition of productive action) that it accomplishes is pissing a few people off. Not wearing a mask is simply a show of your values, nothing more. Wearing a cross necklace doesn't make people want to convert to Christianity, for instance.</p>
<p>Fact is that much more needs to be done, and I'm curious as to whether or not people on this sub support actual productive efforts to restore the world to its previous state as fast as possible or are just here to jerk each other off about not wearing a mask. If it's the latter then this isn't the place I thought it was, I have no interest in another echo chamber on Reddit. What I'm interested in are people that actually want change, and I'm more inclined to believe that that's where you guys land.</p>
<p>So let's assess where we are now. Since Summer a few things have come up that are very telling of our dear leaders and their motives/values. You've got:</p>
<ul>
<li>Austin's mayor Steve Adler telling people to stay home and not go anywhere from his hotel room in Cabo</li>
<li>California's governor Gavin Newsom attending indoor dining - no social distancing, no masks, crowds - all while issuing edicts that lock California down even harder</li>
<li>The media actively censoring and distorting the truth. BLM riots are fine, Biden celebrations in the streets are fine, churches celebrating Christmas are a no-no</li>
<li><strong>INSANE</strong> shifting of goalposts and <strong>deliberate withholding of information from Dr. Fauci</strong>. I can't be assed to find the article, but Fauci straight up admitted to lying to the public about how soon herd immunity could be achieved. The "back to normal" date continues to slip further and further away</li>
<li>And to top it all off, <strong>a fucking $600 stimulus check</strong>. That's right folks. For all of your hard work, for all of your years paying taxes, daddy government has decided that $600 is plenty to cover the hardships you've faced over the past 6 months. One fucking $600 check. I don't give a shit, I'm doing just fine, but the fact that this is what the government feels its own citizens are worth is fucking sickening.</li>
</ul>
<p>What's all of this have to do with us? A lot, actually. Like I touched on before I feel as though the people of this sub genuinely want a change here and are fed up with the current status quo. That in mind, and with what we've seen in the past few months, it's <strong>very clear</strong> that there's a bigger problem here that transcends the squabbles between the mask/no-mask (or left/right for all intents and purposes). What we're witnessing here is even bigger than just the whole covid pandemic in itself. We're witnessing <strong>deliberate government hypocrisy, lying to the people, over-reaching, blatant disregard for the commons, and straight up dictatorship</strong>. </p>
<p>This is of course disgusting to me, disgusting to you, and most likely disgusting to those on the left as well. I think that a lot of the folks here are pro-gun. Why are you pro-gun? To keep the government in check of course. Well, here you are - the government is running completely rampant and I haven't heard a peep from the very folks that claimed they would resist this type of thing anywhere in real life. The left took to the streets for BLM, where are our riots? Where are the people with pitchforks and torches in front of the Whitehouse demanding an end to this bullshit? Once again, all talk. </p>
<p>Here are my proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First and foremost realize that it's not mask vs. anti-mask</strong>. That's a total farce. We are being pitted against each other, main stream media loves to fan the flames, shills on Reddit love to fan the flames (even on this sub), it's generally in the government's best interest that the right be brigading against the left and vice-versa (this is why anti-maskers are branded as right wing while maskers are branded as left wing so often. In reality this is really not the case). You don't have to like the other side, in fact you can continue to hate the left as much as you want, but right now you need to realize that there's a more pressing concern and that's the government in general. The enemy of your enemy is your friend. I cannot stress this enough, find the ability to bridge the gap between right and left ideals for the time being so that the common people can unite and make a united effort to hold the government accountable for their piss poor job of running the country (this goes for both groups of course). After that you can continue to fight amongst yourselves.</li>
<li><strong>Realize that you really need to do more than not wear a mask in public</strong>. I don't understand why so many choose to die on this hill and think that it's the pinnacle of resistance. I'm sorry but if you think you're a brave hero for not wearing a mask in public you're incredibly na√Øve. I support not wearing masks, but it has to be done in conjunction with a larger set of values and a more diverse action plan. Just not wearing a mask and self-stylizing yourself as a wolf/lion is some fantasy shit. Actually do something then pat yourself on the back.</li>
<li><strong>Look at where we are, look at the constantly shifting goal posts, look at the rampant government corruption, realize that pushback is necessary at this point and that that pushback must be nuanced</strong>. We are supposed to be the ones holding the government in check. Not "we" as in the people on this sub, we as in a <em>collective people</em>. Anybody that is not the 1% is on the same team, right or left. Now, I'm not going to advocate vandalism or violence, but here's a video of Hong Kong citizens cutting down a facial recognition tower <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW18_rOUa2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW18_rOUa2s</a>. If you ask me, they've done more in 30 seconds than anything I've seen here in the US, and here's why: whether you're right wing or left wing you can likely generally agree that government surveillance is bad. Of course, vandalism is bad, but if the government erects a tower to literally spy on you and you say "no that's too far" by cutting it down I think that the vandalism is justified. This is the type of pushback that we need - no MAGA, no Biden, no political bullshit whatsoever, just the people for the people. Make no mistake, <strong>we need protests</strong> <strong>and we need them yesterday</strong> - peaceful, tasteful protests. These protests absolutely <strong>must be a joint effort from the right and left otherwise MSM will use them as a prop to fan the flames and pit right and left against each other</strong>. The goal is people vs. government not people vs. people. The government should live in fear of what happens when they fuck with the people they're supposed to be working for.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on and on but I'll end the rant there, I think I've said enough. Long story short, we need people vs. government and we need it now. If there are any folks out there that also want this I would love to start a discussion as to how we can start making that happen. Happy new year, here's to a better 2021.</p></p>

        <p>I don't think they are tailored to a niche audience really. Humor and satire have been used to change public opinion for centuries. It's often very effective. It seems like if you can get people to laugh and see some truth to the joke they start thinking about the counter-position a bit more seriously.</p>

        <p>I do agree with that however I don't see these memes anywhere besides this subreddit. I do know how powerful memes can be and I do think it's a fantastic way to expose people to different ways of thinking but I don't think I've seen anything the likes of which this subreddit produces on any major influential Instagram meme accounts or anything for instance, I think if they started to be picked up by those then there's some real chance at changing things</p>

        <p>Agree to disagree on that one, I think that it's not something that needs to happen in sequence. I think that the very issue is that there's still division between mask/anti-mask. For instance, if someone disagrees with lockdowns and government but they prefer to wear a mask for personal reasons are they your friend or your enemy? 
The fact that people put so much stock into what you choose to wear or not wear is ridiculous. Nobody should give the slightest fuck either way. Wear a mask, or don't, who cares, we have bigger problems and not wearing a mask isn't a precursor to solving those.</p>

        <p>No. If they choose to wear it it's just that, a choice. If they don't want to wear it but still do because it's government mandated, that's submission. The point is that it should be exactly that, a choice. If you are going to rule out a whole group of people because of what they choose to do then you're no better than the tyrants you hate. There shouldn't be judgement from either side is what I'm saying, wear a mask or don't who gives a shit as long as it's a personal choice and nothing more. No judgement, no nothing, literally just a choice of what you decide to wear same clothes or shoes etc. </p>
<p>I know that's not what it is right now, but that's what I'd like it to be. It should be absolutely trivial. Like I said, we have bigger problems than getting hung up on whether or not someone wears a fucking mask.</p>

<p>before the dictates, it is illegal to wear masks or disguises in public. those are actual statutes on the books. </p>
<p>when michael jackson wore a face diaper he was widely ridiculed for doing so, rightly called a hypochondriac and more.</p>
<p>i don't hate the gullible, fearful, compliant faced diapered masses. i pity them and wish for their speedy recovery from the media induced psychosis they suffer. can the face diapered say the same?</p>
<p>as for what you want... i want a lot of things, we can make a list of things we want..</p>
<p>i want to see these local politicians turned dictators  their paid minions and enforcers put in their rightful place as the SERVANTS they falsely claim to be. the face diapered will not help me in bringing that about.</p>

        <p>I think you need to appreciate the small acts of civil disobedience and the way they will lend themselves towards questioning the entire narrative and eventually getting people on board with counter measures and protests.  Seeing that video going around on twitter of the woman who refused to wear a mask in CVS and then adamantly elucidated her point really did my heart good and you could see from the replies (I don't have a twitter account) that many people were sympathetic.  And I'm beginning to see this more and more everywhere on every social media platform.</p>
<p>I absolutely agree with you, though.  More needs to be done.  But I think we're witnessing the beginnings of the resistance and just need more people to turn their despair and resignation into anger and all that needs to happen for that transmutation to occur is for people to realize that these 'public health measures' are not based on anything legitimate or rational.  I think the tipping point for bridging the left vs right/political divide will start happening as more and more people are severely negatively affected by the government's actions.</p>

        <p>Been saying this for a while:</p>
<p>I'm a political nihilist, where to me both sides of the coin are the same trash.</p>
<p>Regardless of political/religious beliefs, it's become a game of pitting the poor against the poorer while the rich get even richer.</p>
<p>Nobody noticed that the federal reserve passed legislation for not requiring banks to have any physical cash on hand to pay out to people.</p>
<p>Nobody noticed the government increasingly (but peacemeal) encroaching into your lives and your homes.</p>
<p>Nobody noticed the curation of data, search results and social media posts to promote the desires of the elite.</p>
<p>Nobody noticed the racial bucketing and stereotyping of culture based on skin color.</p>
<p>The lockdowns were meant to keep us apart so we can be #alonetogether (this is a stupid, oxymoronic hashtag)</p>
<p>Keep us divided so they can continue to control us because united we're a threat.</p>
<p>I'm tired of asking "why?" while everyone sits in idle compliance.</p>

        <p>100%. I‚Äôm fairly new to the everyone is shit bags POV, but I completely agree. Right and left is simply unfair identifiers for a more complex system in which both tribes are right in some ways but both tribes execute only what benefits their rich friends and reelection efforts. </p>
<p>Some want to blame the government and some want to blame corporations, no one wants to say both of those factions are working hand in hand to increase their power, make it remarkably hard to change who wields said power, and slowly restrict freedoms through either law, mandate, or manufactured consent. Both sides are wielding away, and we need to get mad.</p>
<p>There are no heroes, no one is coming to save us. Captain America is a fictional character, and if you read comics would know that he was used multiple times to produce produce propaganda. Since we have no savior coming, the very first thing we need to do is get mad.</p>

        <p>There is an entire political faction with tens of millions of people who have adopted the tyrannical response to the coronavirus and made it their own. They're largely made up of those store Karens who berate and attack other people for not wearing a mask. A lot of those Karens are the very government officials who have been pushing and supporting this garbage to begin with.</p>
<p>People like that very much are the problem and naively pretending they're not isn't going to solve anything, it's only going to make the problem worse. They really have their minds made up and there's nothing you're going to do to convince them because this is a means to fighting a civil war against a hated enemy for them. </p>
<p>It's never been the people vs. the government because the government comprises of a subsect of the people.</p>

        <p>I am content to do nothing and view this as a form of natural selection that will benefit me in the long term. </p>
<p>After it became clear that we are doing this for the foreseeable future, I tailored my life and made connections and only shop at businesses and attend establishments that don't enforce these rules. I wear a mask at work when I speak with cattle and fly on airlines, dgaf. </p>
<p>People that follow these guidelines are becoming obese, crippling their mental health, ruining their relationships, and that's just for starters. Many of them will kill themselves and few will ever have children because of their absurd lives. They are already injecting a mystery vaccine into their body, voluntarily.</p>
<p>I come to this sub to try to understand how the public is so stupid, to enjoy the memes, and to argue with bots.</p>
<p>My desire to use my energy to help the stupid is 0. I feel bad for the normal citizens of European countries but my empathy ends there.</p>

        <p>I clicked this link expecting a low effort shitpost and came here to absolutely dogpile on it. That‚Äôs not what I found and would like to commend OPs comments. I may not agree 100%, but he highlights so many great points we need to think and talk about. As a former lefty who decided left wasn‚Äôt right after Bernie got fucked for a second time and laid down quietly, made me think he is a pied piper for the D party... but I didn‚Äôt come here to talk politics. I came here to talk challenges.</p>
<p>This is the area where I was going to simply dogpile on OP, but given his/her effort in the post I‚Äôll take the slow route here. OP is correct, the government overreach is a giant problem, but it‚Äôs not our only problem. Their are interest groups that are arguably more powerful than government. The Banking cartel and their interest for a cashless society. The pharmaceutical industry and their desire for government mandated vaccines and potentially other mandated treatments. The media conglomerates who are really only a couple corporations like Clearchannel who benefit from ad Rev and seem to enjoy reporting the ‚Äútruth‚Äù more than reporting the news. Their 2 highest ad Rev streams are government ads and pharmaceutical commercials... and some old adage if he who pays is in charge. Social media companies who are lowly regulated, generating capital from ad Rev and data sales at record paces who seem all too happy being the doorkeepers to the truth and cultivators of the narrative. The prison industrial complex because the idea of more inmates is profitable, doesn‚Äôt matter what the laws are that cause the incarceration. The list goes on, I just wanted to illustrate a point.</p>
<p>This is an impossible fight but it‚Äôs still the one that needs to happen. The fight may be on the battle lines of freedom to choose to or not to mask, to or not to vaccine, but OP is 100% the real fight is for freedom, and we aren‚Äôt just loosing, we aren‚Äôt even fighting. How do we fight? I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm hoping a combo of a smarter person than me and some old fashioned think tank yields us answers to our current and perilous common problem.</p>

        <p>Solid comment, I'm glad you brought up the people behind the scenes since that's slipped my mind lately as I've been focused more on the government itself. It's good to remember that there are other enemies out there lurking.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, something needs to get done. At the very least there needs to be pressure on the government, any pressure whatsoever. If they're going to pander to banks for instance then they should be concerned about public backlash for their actions. Right now they're not.</p>
<p>In terms of what can be done, I don't know either, but I think a start would be to push a community (a new subreddit perhaps) that first and foremost encourages unity between the two "tribes" of right and left in a "we may disagree on some things but when it comes down to it we're on the same team" type of way (of course there's no room for radicalism in such a place). Right now the internet is so divided and it seems like it's the best place to reach a large audience fast. Then once we're all on the same page about this lockdown bullshit - and the left is too for the most part see r/lockdowncriticalleft - we can figure out what to do together.</p>

        <p>A new home is an answer, and it‚Äôs not. Uniting online is great but as long as bots, shills, censors, etc it‚Äôs a loosing battleground. Their is an art and science in keeping online from yielding anything progressive. In my calmest voice possible, I think some radicalism may be needed. Friendly non-violent protests are encouraged because they can be ignored for not being a threat (giant note, I am not advocating for violent protests so let‚Äôs not put words into my mouth please). Our government has demonstrated recently there is reason to question our current form of democracy and the adage of its not the votes that matters, it‚Äôs who counts the votes that matter; so we shouldn‚Äôt expect self policing government or electing the problem to be a solution. The control mechanisms for our current financial system are extremely hamstrung from a disproportionate amount of wealth being held by a small amount of people that are causing current said problem, voting with your wallet is out as a strategy because we will starve well before those who hold the assets will coupled with the fact getting everyone to simultaneously reject our currency system is impossible, and quite frankly dangerous if for some reason it finds it way from fairy tale land. We have allowed corporations to wield such immense power they through lobbying and through PACs control who does and doesn‚Äôt get elected so getting more regulation to stop the mega conglomerates isn‚Äôt likely either as it‚Äôs against the elected officials best interests to do so.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want to paint a bleak picture, I want to share the roads I know won‚Äôt be successful so we can starting ones that will.</p>
