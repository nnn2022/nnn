    <strong>Door to door vaccination pushers. Anyone else ?</strong>
    <p><p>So this happened a few weeks ago, but I just remembered a few days ago how freaky that experience was and how I felt something disturbingly wrong with what may lie ahead.</p>
<p>I had just come back from swimming and as I arrived on the floor where my condo is I came to find 3-4 women from Quebec Health knocking on doors and leaving vaccination pamphlets on the doors of those who were presumably not at home or didn’t want to answer. I got chills when I realized that they were mostly here to talk about vaccination as I overheard perfectly well my neighbour talking with one of these women. </p>
<p>My neighbour was telling the woman who knocked on her door that she didn’t feel comfortable with the vaccine at all as she knows more people who have had adverse effects from the vaccine than people getting covid, let alone any fatalities from covid. The woman posed further questions such as: if she were willing to take it which one would it be, if there was anything the government could do for her to feel more comfortable, why she didn’t want to take it, etc. As I was opening the door to my condo one of them approached me and I said I shared the same sentiment as my neighbour and that in fact I only knew exactly 4 people who had gotten covid and all were well after a week or two and that on the other hand knew dozens of people having terrible side effects from the vaccine. </p>
<p>Anyhow, I just remember having a horrible feeling of what I had just witnessed. Never thought I’d see to live something like the Jehovah’s Witnesses but regarding vaccines. I was already planning to leave Canada after graduating university before this scamdemic started, but this just  reassured my decision. </p>
<p>Has anyone anywhere else have this happen to them?</p></p>

        <p>I'm in New York but I know someone in New Jersey who told me that they sent out some sort of covid team to knock on the doors of unvaccinated people down the Jersey Shore. She said they knocked at her door at 3 in the afternoon on Father's Day. Apparently they have some sort of database of unvaccinated people. If they start doing that here in New York City and they come to my door I will treat them like any other annoyance and not answer the door. It's getting to the point where I feel almost violent toward anyone who tries to push this on me. I'm sick of the constant pestering and propaganda. I'm not going to have a discussion about this I've made my decision and nothing will change my mind. I'm not on the fence at all I know what I want and it's not that.</p>

        <p>Exactly this.  There is no legal requirement to answer any questions at all, even your name if you’re at home in your own property.  Tell them that your home is private property and to leave immediately.  Do not let them in.  Speak through the door or step outside and lock the door behind you with your keeps in your pocket.</p>
<p>Tell them to move along and close the door and ignore them until they go away.  If they linger on the property record everything (which you should be doing anyway) and build a case for trespassing, especially if you’ve asked them to leave.  It is your private residence.</p>

        <p>If this happens, don’t answer any questions at all and tell them to leave immediately.  You have no obligation to answer questions without an attorney president, simple 5th amendment rights.  If they try to enter without a warrant then it’s an unconstitutional 4th amendment violation so immediately vocalize I do not consent to you entering my property without a warrant.  Please leave immediately.</p>
<p>No matter what they say just ignore it.  You may hear some lie but don’t buy it.  Any information you volunteer can and will be used against you.  Inviting government agents to enter your property is essentially consenting to a search.  It’s critical you vocalize your intentions so that it’s crystal clear.  Even if an unconstitutional search occurs you can often have it thrown out during discovery by a competent defense attorney, although who knows if we can trust the legal system to render a fair trial with how everything’s gone over the last year.</p>

        <p>I’m in New York State.  What’s going on in Canada scares the hell out of me.  When I had heard of curfews it blew my mind.  Businesses were restricted where I was but freedom of movement never changed.  No one came to my door to ask questions they have no business knowing.</p>
<p>It’s a polite police state and very sinister.  People think you’re just upset that some person is handing out information and gathering data.  There’s a sinister undertone to it however.  It’s harassment with some built in deniability and optics leaning in their favor.</p>
<p>It would make me very uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>Earlier this year I was spammed by the  department of drug abuse and prevention looking to get me to fill out a survey about my drug use. I refused to disclose shit - they have my address even if my name isn't tied to it.</p>
<p>After a month of receiving half a dozen letters they sent a lady to my door. Near the end of the conversation about her job and how I could have it filled out in ten minutes she admitted quietly that it was voluntary so I immediately told her "then I decline" and slammed the door in her face.</p>
<p>Fuck government intrusion into my privacy.</p>
