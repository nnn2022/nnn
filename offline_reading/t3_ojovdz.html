    <strong>How far is too far. At what point to do abandon familiarity in the name of safety?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been seeing more posts from European countries like France where the OP is talking about how bad it's getting. How they need to consider moving somewhere else. The same thing for Americans, leaving their lockdown states for states that respect their rights. </p>
<p>As a Californian, I'm coming to realize that were getting dangerously close to the point that I can't in good conscience stay where it's familiar when I feel I can no longer keep my family safe.</p>
<p>I keep hoping that things will stop creeping forward. But that is paper thin wishful thinking. </p>
<p>With regard to how far they will take this, how far is too far for you? At what point do you pack up and relocate?</p></p>

        <p>I'm in France now and they've just recently announced covid health passes will be required to visit all businesses. The vaccination is now essentially mandatory or you will be required to have a covid test every 2 days to prove you aren't infected. Macron is a cunt</p>

        <p>I'm saddened more than anything. The government has followed every step us "conspiracy theorists" have predicted. And still everyone is going along with it, and we're the crazy ones. I will resist as long as possible but the new world in unavoidable with so much cognitive dissonance and fact twisting performed by 90% of the population.</p>

        <p>It will be like that everywhere. We're under a NWO global government and they are just pretending different countries have more freedom so people won't catch on that we're under NWO but we are. All countries are in a state of emergency and soon we'll see UN treaties on controlling the virus and all will sign on.</p>

        <p>For some reason I thought almost all states had dropped them, but I guess I'm mistaken, unless your state is an outlier. Canada never declared a federal state of emergency (thank goodness - I read up on how harsh that could be), but every province did.</p>

        <p>I think only a handful of states have lifted it. I think most Democrat governors still have it but it really doesn't matter because local areas impose restrictions. Agenda 21 describes this ability of regions, towns to set their own rules. All of it is illegal but we're in the land of lawlessness now.</p>

        <p>It's crazy here in france since they announced the new measure apparently a record number of people have signed up to get vaccinated. France was apparently one of the most vaccine sceptic countries in the west. But tell them they cant go the restaurant and suddenly ethics are out the window. The worst part is that everyone in my family has had their vaccine, I'm the last, and the first thing they did was start pressuring me to get it. I'm so tired of being proven right about the government at every turn and yet still I'm treated like the nutcase in the family.</p>

        <p>I feel the same as you, I am a single woman with no family living in New York City. My anxiety increases daily. I decided I needed to feel some sense of control so I looked at a map and I eliminated states that have not banned the vaccine passport. I'm honing in on Tennessee at the moment but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>I have a week off in August and I have rented a car and I'm going to drive down to take a look. I also contacted the state licensing board for my profession to see what I would have to do to transfer my license there need be. Also went on indeed.com in case I need to look for work and there were actually a decent amount of jobs available. </p>
<p>The idea of going someplace and being completely alone with no one is terrifying me but the idea of staying here is just as bad. I don't see things getting better I'm not sure what I'm going to do. A close friend of mine has a husband and three children and she's thinking of doing the exact same thing. We talk daily. If we do both decide to do what we are going to try to move near one another. Time will tell. But I'm certainly not going to stay someplace that treats me like a slave and forces me to get injections I don't want. Even if I don't move I'm trying to get a plan ready. I've been going through things in my apartment and throwing a lot out. I want to be able to pack fairly easily if I have to. </p>
<p>We have to think of these things, we can't be scrambling at the last minute if we need to get out of where we are. Unfortunately it sounds like you and I are both in a couple of the worst places in the country right now. If it stays like it is now I can tolerate it but if it progresses and gets even worse it just doesn't look good.</p>

        <p>To avoid violence, one must first seek alternatives. If that means moving to a more rights-friendly state, and with like-minded folk, the better. Might have to sacrifice plans and careers in the short term, but it's better than getting trapped in some kind of medical zoned prison.</p>
