        <p>Thanks for asking!</p>
<p>The short answer is that masks don’t work and are uncomfortable. </p>
<p>The long answer is that there are numerous studies proving masks don’t work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664">Japanese researchers found that cloth masks “offer zero protection against coronavirus”</a></p>
<p>Also, I apologize on behalf of the other commenters who were a bit rude. Honest questions deserve honest answers.</p>

        <p>they aren’t meant to completely prevent the spread, they’re meant to work together with social distancing and hand sanitising to lower your risk of covid. but yeah, thanks for actually giving a well constructed answer</p>

        <p>The problem is that masks have <em>zero</em> efficacy, and may even <em>increase</em> the risk of infection, as shown in the studies I linked. As for hand sanitizing, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/catching-covid-surfaces-risk-very-110222317.html">there is probably no reason to be doing that, as COVID does not really spread on surfaces</a>. And social distancing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/27/health/covid-spread-inside-wellness/index.html">only works outdoors</a>.</p>
<p>But beyond that, you really shouldn’t be worrying yourself about COVID because it has almost the exact same death rate as the flu.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% IFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>This means that if you want to compare COVID and the flu apples-to-apples, we need to calculate COVID’s IFR the same way as the flu’s, which gives us an IFR of .11% (rounded to 2 significant figures), almost the same as the flu’s .13%.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, things are not quite so simple as they appear. Many scientists smarter than the both of us did experiments on this, and they found the exact opposite.</p>
<p>However, I am not a proponent of the <em>argumentum ab auctoritate</em> logical fallacy, so if you think those scientific studies say otherwise, I’d certainly be open to hearing your explanation.</p>

        <p>My legitimate answer - I could care less about the mask itself. My problem comes when suddenly it's okay for the government and everyone else to tell me I have to, and take away my right to choose whether I want to or not. Because it starts with something like a mask that doesn't matter, and before you realize what happened, random personal searches and things of that nature are "required" and you're expected to just comply.</p>

<p>Seatbelt and helmet laws apply to the personal safety of the wearer and do not confer extra protection to a third party. Please stop using these asinine examples.</p>

        <p>The fact that those laws only protect the user is why I used those examples. Why is it wrong for the government to enact mask mandates that are designed to protect society as a whole, but seat belt laws that only protect the user are fine?</p>
<p>If your argument against mask mandates is because you think it infringes on your personal freedom, then you should feel the same way about seat belt laws. You should be even more upset about it <em>because</em> it is only designed to protect the user.</p>

        <p>There's a big difference. Those are proven to work. Everything surrounding covid has basically 50/50 of people saying whether it works or not. Masks, vaccines, all of it. And when the guiding powers like the cdc, WHO, and others are showing a history of changing their opinions based on at best conflicting evidence, suddenly its not the same scenario at all.</p>

        <p>?? if you’re so young and healthy, and 70 year old people can wear a mask, why can’t you? it’s not about protecting yourself and keeping your own precautions, it’s about taking the effort to put on a mask to protect people who are more vulnerable. it’s about not spreading water droplets to older people or people with illnesses so that less people die. it’s simple empathy. sure, they make communication more difficult, but helmets are uncomfortable and we still wear them to protect ourselves. the moment it becomes about protecting other people, you’re suddenly so aware of the obstructed airways. it’s not that hard to have some sympathy.</p>

<p>&rt;taking the effort to put on a mask to protect people who are more vulnerable.</p>
<p>But those people who are more vulnerable need to realize their own risk and be taking their own personal precautions. If they do so, there's a high likelihood that they'll be just fine.</p>
<p>&rt;it’s simple empathy.</p>
<p>I'm quite empathetic, especially towards all of the people who have been harmed and killed by the mandates and all of the other subsequent restrictions and lockdowns that so often accompany them.</p>
<p>&rt;helmets are uncomfortable and we still wear them to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>Only helmets aren't whatsoever mandated to be worn, let alone mandated to be worn as soon as you step outside your house, even though they're significantly more effective and useful than a dirty old piece of cloth that the vast majority of people render near useless anyway. The choice to wear a helmet, weigh personal risk vs. reward, and to be responsible for your own health is left up to the individual. Funny enough, there's a picture on here of a guy riding his motorcycle without a helmet, but with a mask on, because health.</p>
<p>&rt;the moment it becomes about protecting other people, you’re suddenly so aware of the obstructed airways.</p>
<p>I don't understand what you're getting at.</p>
<p>&rt;it’s not that hard to have some sympathy.</p>
<p>You can feel empathy and/or sympathy for people and still believe that personal responsibility needs to take priority. "Do you ever ride in cars? Well then, you must not have any empathy for all those people who get harmed and killed in car accidents." Silly, right?</p>
<p>Protect the vulnerable, and take any and all personal precautions necessary in order to make you feel safe. If you're still afraid now that vaccines have been rolled out en masse, then that's solely on you.</p>

        <p>holy shit. i thought morons like you were rare. i can’t wrap my head around the sheer idiocy of some people. you genuinely don’t give a shit about other people and refuse to wear a mask because they’re ‘muzzles’? what the actual fuck. i can’t tell whether you’re a 40 year old redneck or a 12 year old who’s been brainwashed by his parents into thinking that the virus is propaganda. get yourself together man.</p>

        <p>The health problems created from wearing masks are worse than the virus. Besides that, they don't even do anything to prevent the spread. At the beginning we were all told by the CDC that healthy people should not wear masks due to the health concerns. But your Hollywood Dr. Fauci says we need to wear them. You do you. We'll do us.

        <p>?? if you’re so young and healthy, and 70 year old people can wear a mask, why can’t you? it’s not about protecting yourself and keeping your own precautions, it’s about taking the effort to put on a mask to protect people who are more vulnerable. it’s about not spreading water droplets to older people or people with illnesses so that less people die. masks prevent droplets from spreading and infecting others. it’s science, but it’s also it’s basic empathy. sure, they make communication more difficult, but helmets are uncomfortable and we still wear them to protect ourselves. the moment it becomes about protecting other people, you’re suddenly so aware of the obstructed airways. it’s not that hard to have some sympathy.</p>

        <p>Don’t act like you give a shit about people. Lockdowns have caused more harm than the actual virus. Suicide, Domestic Violence, Addiction are all on the rise and that’s just the top of the iceberg. So again you don’t give a flying fuck about people. Only reason I’m here is because I believe ALL people should have the freedom to do what they want. So tell me again? Who is it that cares about people?</p>
<p>Also, my one of my grandmas died of covid this past November (she was a chainsmoker/alcoholic), but I also have a grandfather that was exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam after being drafted to fight for your freedom to be a limp dick pussy ass mother fucker. He has tons of underlying conditions, and never wears a mask. Just saw him last weekend and he’s alive and kicking and has been throughout the plandemic. Dude is retired and travels more than I do. Can you explain all that?</p>
<p>Conclusion: you need to get out of the house more. You weren’t getting out enough even before covid.</p>
<p>Alternative conclusion: shut the fuck up and finish high school first, child. The adults are speaking.</p>

        <p>Most people don’t have a problem with the mask itself I don’t think so anyways, it’s the ‘mask mandate’ that everywhere has that people have a problem with, and people choose not to wear them to ‘protest’ against this mandate.</p>
<p>When we have been told by the scientists that the government choose for us to listen to that they work, they being the masks, and when we do our own research and just as many if not scientists say the masks most of us have are useless there’s not much point of wearing one except making people feel happy and safe.</p>
<p>That’s my idea of what is going on anyway, I know I didn’t answer your question all that well but I don’t wear a mash because I don’t go outside uni work has me stuck doing like 8 hours a day and then I’m exhausted and after I work, also from home there is like 20 seconds left in the day.</p>

        <p>its not about protecting yourself and keeping your own precautions, or even socialising, it’s about taking the effort to put on a mask to protect people who are more vulnerable. it’s about not spreading water droplets to older people or people with illnesses so that less people die. masks prevent droplets from spreading and infecting others. it’s science, but it’s also it’s basic empathy. sure, they make communication more difficult, but helmets are uncomfortable and we still wear them to protect ourselves. the moment it becomes about protecting other people, you’re suddenly so aware of the obstructed airways. it’s not that hard to have some sympathy. you can socialise with masks, and not have the possibility of murdering some older people with the virus because you refused to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>What you say is based on a premise which I simply don't think is true:
People without any symptoms of disease having a significant chance of infecting other people with a severe disease.
To me that's an irrational fear. One that I think only hypochondriacs have.</p>
<p>If someone thinks like that, then they can put on two masks at once. But I don't see it as my responsibility to act upon the irrational fears of other people.</p>

        <p>&rt; why do you not want to wear a mask? </p>
<p>I will throw the question right back at you, if the government mandated that you wear the symbol of your religion or philosophy on your clothing, yes or no, would you wear it?</p>
<p>Secondly, I am a very physically active individual, I participate in martial arts, exercise a lot, and do lots of hiking, in addition to having a repaired cleft palette. I am physically healthy, I am not sick, why do I have to wear a medical device despite not being sick?</p>
