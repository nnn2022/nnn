        <p>Everyone should be home schooling. Not because of the danger of illness but because of the way your children will be treated by irrational policies, shaming, and etc.</p>
<p>All that besides the fact that government schools don’t teach morality or tradition or personal history.</p>

        <p>If that was true (regardless of the virus) then schools wouldn't exist and teachers wouldn't be needed. Do you know how many people with very basic education themselves have kids that do very well at school and get a degree afterwards, they wouldn't be able to do this if they were homeschooled by their (no offence to anyone) uneducated parents. Public schools provide at least some level of education to children from all backgrounds, including children with parents who are not the greatest at being parents and in an ideal world maybe these people shouldn't even have kids. But they do, and the kids exist, and they have a right to an unbiased education. Not everyone is in such a perfect situation where they work from home in some kind of relaxed flexible job and have the means to home school their kids either. (Just to be clear, I don't have kids)</p>

        <p>The thing about public schools and government education is that you go there for twelve years and then leave it not being qualified to do anything. And you have to ask how that is acceptable in any way.</p>
<p>On top of that you also don’t get to choose what you learn or get any actual job training. You spend twelve years to get zero skills. You don’t even learn how to do your own taxes in schools.</p>
<p>And because of the nature of politics in schools you can’t even learn proper tradition customs history or philosophy because you’re in this pot of other children all of whom have completely different backgrounds practices and beliefs.  Any focused cultural education becomes problematic for one group or another and suddenly you’ll have parents kicking down doors screaming at teachers for giving them wrong think.</p>
<p>Unless it’s anti white of course. Then it’s fine.</p>

        <p>I agree with you on a lot of those points. Basic education in public schools is far from what it should be, but it is still more than some kids from poor uneducated families would get if they were home schooled. I imagine when people have enough money they move their kids to private schools, so the public ones are for working class and poor people. But it does depend on the country, I went to public schools and I had a choice of what I wanted to learn, my mathematics teacher covered taxes which I admit is not common, and I went to a technical university for which I didnt need to pay for. Just depends on a country.</p>
