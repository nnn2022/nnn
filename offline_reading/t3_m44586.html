        <p>I find it difficult to suppress my cynicism and misanthropy as my life and millions of others are damaged irreparably by covid-worshipping chicken littles, screaming non stop about how we all have to stop living to address a virus that kills less than 1% of people it infects, wanting to mandate vaccine passports, indefinite lockdowns and the complete retardation of human development, meanwhile no one gives a damn about influenza, tuburculosis, hiv, and other potentially deadly infections diseases.</p>

        <p>Come to California. In my town, 90% of people wear them outdoors. All of the nice hiking trails have been ruined by scared/angry people dawning masks on the trails. People will glare at you and/or sheepishly adjust their mask when about to pass on the trail if you are not wearing one.</p>

        <p>So I was wondering are there any studies on the long term effects of wearing surgical masks all day? The fibers used to make the masks are all plastic based. So what does that do to a person's lungs who is breathing in microplastics 16+ hours a day/7days a week? Especially in kids whose lungs are still developing?</p>

        <p>I should really be saving the links to these on my hard drive. But the HighWire talks about a study in which medical masks can/may cause mesothelioma, which is a form of lung cancer from absorbing tiny fibres through the air, similar to asbestos.</p>

        <p>The new normal is already here. I feel more hopeless than usual these days. The virus is getting less and less dangerous if it ever was any real danger at all but the restrictions are mounting. Feel so lonely walking alone without mask in the sea of masked zombies and they look comfortable wearing their slave muzzle these days, like they don't even notice it's anything weird any more. The new normal is already here.</p>

        <p>Anyone else find it ironic that people on the left claim to be concerned with authoritarianism around the world like military coups yet don’t seem to realize they voted for a guy that passed a ridiculous number of executive orders within a single day, wants to disarm a large portion of the population, think the government can pass as many mandates as it wants, and thinks people who don’t wear masks shouldn’t be allowed in public.

        <p>Which left? There is a principled left embodied by people like Noam Chomsky, Jimmy Dore, Caitlyn Johnstone, et al. who are fierce and passionate activists against war, imperialism, and propaganda. I will admit that while this faction of the left has been less vociferoisly opposed to lockdowns than I had hoped, they are not the same as the “left” championing lockdowns and medical dictatorship, and despise this “left” as much as we do</p>

        <p>I'm sooo sick of all of this! I'm medically exempt from wearing a mask because of a skin condition and people treat me like dirt. I'm not trying to be an ass about wearing a mask, I just can't physically wear one! And because of that everyone thinks I'm a bad person spreading Covid. Not everyone can wear one, but you get these people saying "JuSt wEaR A mAsK bRo!" It's ridiculous. And stores try to kick you out. Even though medical exemptions exist. Tired, so very tired of all of this.</p>

        <p>This week I was yelled at by a middle age woman in her pajamas for not wearing a mask outside. She started off nice and then got condescending and loud very fast when I declined her offer to mask up. How sad when you can’t even walk your dog in your own damn neighborhood without one of them trying to harass you.</p>

        <p>Almost every post is about Covid. Mods, can we do something about this? This isn't supposed to be a COVID sub, but the ramifications from the injury caused by the removal of our civil liberties. This sub was about not accepting the introduction of the mass change(s) upon society being forced upon us; The introduction of a new way of living - the new normal.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This Sub is being targeted by shills in an effort to sway our narrative away from discussing the non acceptance of NewNormal and the Reset, in to something much more manageable: that of Memes surrounding Covid.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
If this sub is considered "anti-science" regarding Covid, then it presents itself an easy target for deletion.</p>

        <p>I'd disagree, most posts that get highly upvoted have to do with the implications of COVID lockdowns / vaccine passports / perpetual masking. Perhaps the sub looked different 13 hours ago, but right now it's pretty on point.</p>

        <p>So Im not sure where to ask this so I will ask here. I just got a call from the county I reside in that I was exposed to someone a week ago. Now they said I have to quarantine for another week (assuming I dont get sick). I am currently not sick. Obviously the recommendation is to quarantine, but what happens if I dont? I have no written notice from them, but just a phone call from a contact tracer. </p>
<p>I know its just a week, but it feels like forever. Is this truly necessary?</p>

<p><em>Today is the 1 year anniversary of this pan-dumbic. 
Today I observe a moment of silence for all of the "friends" and "family" we have lost on social media. Not the ones who have actually died, but for the ones we have excised from our lives because we found out they are brainwashed, science denying, selfish bigoted trumptardian covidiot egotists who believe they know better than any experts.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you to everyone who cant be bothered to obey for the greater good and for the health of your fellow humans. You are the true cause of this last hateful frustrating year. You deserve all the hate scorn and misfortune you get. I honestly hope that some of you die. You know who you are. Because the world would be a brighter place without your selfish Americunt values in it.</em></p>

        <p>A little positive- I went to the park by my cousins house today and it was packed, easily 25 people and not a single mask in sight. Kids at the playground, riding bikes and playing basketball while parents got some much needed socialization. All of us breathing in fresh air and taking advantage of the nice weather. I really needed to experience this today after being harassed twice in the last month alone for not wearing a mask. Everything felt so normal for an hour, it will be sad to go grocery shopping tomorrow and be reminded of how brainwashed the masses are.</p>

        <p>I was at the park earlier today and it was packed but, as always, basically everyone except for myself and my husband were wearing masks...including the kids. There were two moms who weren't wearing masks but their young kids were wearing them and one of the kids started crying and saying that her mask was too hot. But the dumb bitch mom (not even wearing a mask) forced her to put her mask back on.</p>

        <p>I just wanted to remind everyone to check on your family in Nursing Homes. People have been BANNED from visiting family in nursing homes since the beginning of Covid yet the number of deaths IN nursing homes are insanely high. NY had over 15K Nursing Home Deaths they had to start burying people in mass graves and renting freezer trucks for body storage. Michigan is possibly even worse. Now for the part you DONT see.</p>
<p>Some Nursing homes even here in Texas have set up "Covid units" which are hallways that are taped off usually with big sheets of plastic. The nursing home residents IN the Covid units have to stay in the room without coming out. Employees wear masks and gowns etc. That may sound like a good thing but here's the flip.
Some Nursing Homes have a rule where if the Nursing Home patient LEAVES the nursing home for any reason they have to go to the Covid unit for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>For example... Let's say your Granny stays in a nursing home and has a fall and hit her head and they call an ambulance to take her to the ER to be checked out. The ER will give her a covid test. Turns out she's fine and shows negative for Covid. She then gets returned to the nursing home but is taken to the "Covid unit" automatically for 2 weeks. Well the thing is she's going to have a much higher possibility of catching Covid if she's ON the Covid unit and not sick. After 2 weeks the patient is then returned to the general population of the nursing home. So if the patient DID manage to get Covid while on the Covid unit they would then be freely spreading it like a hardcore flu through the rest of the nursing home. When I brought this up at a local nursing home that it seems it would promote spread I was told they had "lost" about a dozen residents but they were following the companies Covid orders. To me it seems more like a culling...</p>
<p>I've brought this up several times to people that it seems backwards but it's fallen of deaf ears. I recommended emptying out an ENTIRE nursing home and using it ONLY for Covid positive patients and when they're better they could be returned. Like what was supposed to happen with the USS Mercy in NY.
Just to give you an idea imagine that MOST nursing homes are following this outline in every county... In every state all over the US. Do you think it would cause an increase in deaths?</p>

        <p>It's always interesting to see how the American COVID response is split exactly on partisan lines. There is way too much polarisation in the American landscape on both sides. It's a shame to see Americans have such pure demonisation and vitriol of your fellow citizens.</p>

        <p>Has this whole covid thing made anyone else a little suspect about the push for global warming action? I actually studied global warming in grad school, and I'm fully aware that CO2 traps heat, but I'm starting to question the tactics being proposed to combat it. If this year taught me anything, it's that models are faulty, the government is awful at achieving goals, and politicians are completely happy to let people suffer to push their agenda.</p>
