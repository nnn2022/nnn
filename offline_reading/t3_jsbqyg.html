    <strong>If you could relive the year 2019 knowing this hellscape would be our future, what are some things you would've done differently?</strong>
    <p><p>The old normal wasn't perfect, but it's way better than what we have to put up with this year. The strained relationships with my family, government overreach, and political division have really messed me up. It took months, but I'm finally at an emotional equilibrium most of the time.</p>
<p>If I could redo 2019, and the previous years, I would've left my toxic relationship sooner, traveled as much as I could afford, went to more concerts and festivals, and just in general appreciated people not being afraid of each other and their unmasked faces. </p>
<p>This new reality makes it hard to dream. I don't want to squander my youth away living like this. Nothing lasts forever, but I just don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I shouldn't have regrets about things out of my control, but I long for the times when missing out on life was my own fault. </p>
<p>My personal problems from last year seem minuscule compared to what I'm dealing with now.</p></p>

        <p>Nothing. I got extremely lucky with how this played out and, living in Florida, our quality of life is tremendous compared to other places. I went out to the bar last night to play trivia, my friends and I went to a different bar after for some shots. We grabbed a pizza on the way home and wore a mask for literally 0 seconds. </p>
<p>I still cannot understand how entire populations of people remain compliant and complicit in this nonsense. Florida might be a psychotic hellscape most of the time, but for once, we are the bastion of liberty and freedom during this idiotic situation.</p>

        <p>I would have asked everybody if they would wear masks to protect me. Because I have a low immune system and they could be presymptomatic. I’d ask them to wear it all the time even when I’m not around so they don’t risk spreading something to someone who spreads it to me. When they would of course get upset and say hell no, I’d say, okay so let’s agree never to force anyone to wear a mask for someone else’s sake. And I’d ask them to shake on it. I might even have a contract prepared to sign. They’d think I was nuts. Then when 2020 mask mandates happened I’d say, no no, we already agreed on this!</p>

        <p>LOL, you'd have ended up in a Chinese prison (or dead) before you handed out the first pamphlet.  After six months in a 5x5 concrete cell and 100 calories a day you'd happily sign a confession.  They do not mess around when it comes to the security of their state.  Our own rulers are eager to set the same thing up here.</p>

        <p>Going to more concerts and festivals would be for me. This has really made me regret not doing more and spending too much time online over the years, when there was the choice to do more things that only real life offers.</p>
<p>It's funny how you don't appreciate things until they're gone, and don't want to do things until you're told you can't do them. But I've been very nostalgic for pre-lockdown social contact, and wish I could be at a festival with thousands of others enjoying life.</p>

        <p>Yup, I just thought I would've had more time. I planned on going to 4 festivals this year. Now I have no idea when I can look forward to the next one, especially one without security theatrics. I don't know when being around thousands of people in appreciation, and not political reasons, will be acceptable again. Maybe there will be a virtual reality equivalent that will never suffice.</p>
<p>I've lost some interest in video games. Gaming just doesn't feel the same anymore because it's one of the few "acceptable" activities and I'm really trying to do bigger things now.</p>

        <p>If I knew absolutely everything in 2019 I knows now, I may have done these things differently (although I don't really regret my 2019 decisions):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applying for a different study</strong> than what I did in 2019. If I knew in the past how much I enjoy my current study, had knowledge about how student life works, the same knowledge about writing exams, what would happen because of COVID19 and all that I may have picked a different study. <strong>Instead of studying art history, I would've studied sign language.</strong> I would in theory miss a few short lasting friendships and a lot of art knowledge, but I don't think I would really miss it and would learn about it very quickly in some other way anyway regardless if I studied it or not. Why? Because of travelling. So, there wouldn't really be any FOMO. The short friendships only lasted a few months and ended anyway for complicated reasons, so it wouldn't bother me if I missed out and had other friends instead. Art history was fun, but I was unhappy about my teachers. The school wasn't very helpful with our study unlike my new one. Although my new one being flawed, it's better and if I studied there before COVID19 hit many of the flaws could've been easily avoided simply because of less security theater.</li>
<li>Travelling more and not wasting my summer vacation.</li>
<li>Trying to <strong>make as many new friends as possible</strong> and be with <strong>different people</strong>. Then I would've been more prepared when the pandemic hit. It would be much easier to feel like a foreigner in my own country and all the familiar things becoming unknown if I had a <strong>knitted community</strong> to stay in. Then we all could be "foreigners" in our own country, feel like an outcast together and have a common language (assuming I would've studied 1 year before COVID19 hit). When everyone else were masked, police couldn't force us to wear one and we could still hang out as long it was only 50% restrictions and not 100% lockdown. I may also get my <strong>hearing checked</strong> earlier too. I got no problems until the mask came.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, I don't regret the decisions I made in 2019. But if I had the same "maturity" and knowledge then like I had now, I would in theory make different decisions.</p>

        <p>I would have gone out more and gone to Vegas while it was still worth it. I stayed home a lot last year because we had just bought a house and needed to rebuild the savings. As soon as that was accomplished, bam! My life is essentially over.</p>
<p>I really wouldn’t want to go back though because that would mean reliving the hellscape that is 2020.</p>

        <p>I would have built stronger friendships while it was legal to hang out (currently illegal in my city to see other people). </p>
<p>Maybe also upgraded my tiny house before the prices went up so much.</p>

        <p>I actually had a great 2019, because it was the first year in my life in a long time where I felt like I was getting better mentally. I went to so many concerts and strengthened my relationships with all of my friends, and I was applying to very interesting colleges where I felt like I would actually secure a career that I wanted. So I guess I wouldn't change much, and would rather be able to go back in time and tell myself what was going to happen this year. I would've taken more risks and been even more honest and stupid, but prepared that none of those good things would last forever. I think the reason this year hurt so much was because I was becoming happier and I was so excited for 2020, so I would love to go back and knock myself back into place lol</p>
