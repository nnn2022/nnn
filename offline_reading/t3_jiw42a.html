    <strong>My job has an interesting Covid policy.</strong>
    <p><p>Apparently, if you suspect that you have Covid and decide to get tested, you're supposed to come in to work until your results come back positive. A couple of my coworkers refused to do this and were threatened with disciplinary measures.</p>
<p>They make us wear masks, distance, keep up with yet another piece of paper to add on to the many others...but if someone knows they're sick and think it's Covid, they have to come to work anyway and spread it while waiting on test results.</p>
<p>If Covid is so deadly, why are all the measures that we deal with only designed to inconvenience the lowly workers? As soon as something inconveniences the big wigs, it's unacceptable.</p></p>

        <p>My workplace:</p>
<p>- Masks in the hallways. Not required in my office (thank God).</p>
<p>- Masks if you can't "social" distance (luckily, everyone ignores this, except for a few bed-wetters).</p>
<p>- Split crew into 2 teams to "limit the spread".</p>
<p>- The two crews are to use separate entrances and exits from each other, for the same reason.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have <em>one</em> smoking area, <em>one</em> lunch/coffee room, and communal washroom facilities and showers. And three of the dudes who work for me share a condo.</p>
<p>Peak fucking clown world.</p>

        <p>Further to my last, the really rage-inducing part of all this is how the upper echelons still expect 100% productivity when all the bullshit restrictions and the fact that supporting agencies we rely on are almost all "working" from home and don't respond in a timely manner mean that it is a struggle to achieve 75%.</p>
<p>My guys are burning out, fast.</p>
<p>I expect to have the last laugh when flu season digs in and half my guys are out on quarantine waiting for Corona test results. I'll put my feet up, drink my coffee, and watch it burn.</p>
