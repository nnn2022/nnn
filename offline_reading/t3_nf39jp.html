    <strong>Minister’s message to the congregation about CDC mask order ending</strong>
    <p><p>My congregation’s newsletter always has an article from the minister. He wrote this last week </p>
<p>&rt;“I am going to miss the camaraderie of those who masked for the last year. I will miss others identifying me as a good citizen, for always wearing a mask, and not endangering others. I think all of us who were conscientious about mask-wearing should get to have a little button to wear proudly, like “I masked every time I went out.” We former maskers will now look like anti-maskers and scofflaws. We have lost our distinction, our virtue, our recognition of being good citizens.”</p>
<p>I sent him an email </p>
<p>&rt; This virtue signaling by mask wearing is exactly what’s wrong with pro lockdown people, or mostly liberals.  You completely nailed the performative smugness. Wearing a mask protects the wearer. It’s not an act of compassion, you all just told yourselves that. How did you not see that masks make people more afraid and less connected? Even though 99% of people recovered from the virus, masks prolonged the feeling of emergency. (They also delayed natural herd immunity) Everyone you meet is a potential threat, which is really not true. It validated the people who already had an inherent fear of sickness, which isn’t healthy. The disconnection of not seeing faces made it hard to be truly friendly at the same level as before. It seems to me it was particularly damaging to children. The world is a dangerous place to them.</p></p>

        <p>Why does he need recognition as a “good citizen?”    This is very bizarre from a minister.  Isn’t being a good citizen it’s own reward?</p>
<p>&rt;Matthew 6</p>
<p>&rt;1“Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven. 2Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. 3But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.</p>

        <p>I attended a Unitarian Universalist church. The Bible isn’t as common a resource like in other churches. </p>
<p>This is the basic theology </p>
<p>1st Principle: The inherent worth and dignity of every person;</p>
<p>2nd Principle: Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;</p>
<p>3rd Principle: Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;</p>
<p>4th Principle: A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;</p>
<p>5th Principle: The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large;</p>
<p>6th Principle: The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;</p>
<p>7th Principle: Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.</p>

        <p>Because they put aside Jesus, the gospel and Christ-like opposition to self-righteousness and hypocrisy, they're now indistinguishable from the evil pharisees who had Jesus crucified. They've abandoned Grace and gone back into bondage under the law of Moses. It's sad, really.</p>

        <p>Your minister sounds like he is suffering from the sin of pride. Perhaps it would be good to privately talk that over with him, so he can correct it.</p>

        <p>Isn’t that what virtue signaling is? Pride?</p>
<p>He described the experience of doomers more accurately than I could have. It was kind of amazing.</p>

        <p>I'm not a churchgoer but I was raised extremely religious. There's so many good pastors out there who really do their best to be a good example and care about people, I think I'd be visiting around different churches every Sunday to find a new one that was more genuine in their beliefs and the way they treat others.</p>
