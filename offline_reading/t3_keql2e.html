    <strong>Julian assange he needs out help</strong>
    <p><p>As we all know or some of us know the creator of wiki leaks Julian assange has been in jail for over two years, for free speech and he didn’t do anything illegal he just released documents he found legally about pizzagate and spying. The conditions he is in are terrible he has been in jail for over 2 years and can’t see his kids he is very frail and weak and very very confused. Je is on a maximum security prison and is being moved to a prison in the US but if Donald trump doesn’t pardon him he could be in the hands of any jails or any person and the prisons he has been in are  just horrid there is an attack on free speech and he needs out help #freemymanz</p></p>
