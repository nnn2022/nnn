        <p>We keep saying this every time my coworker goes in for a covid test before a procedure. He gets the test a few days before, then gets on the bus back to work. Takes another bus to get home, etc etc. So many days between the covid test and the procedure make zero sense to me.</p>

        <p>this is why 'contact tracing' is bullshit. There are too many contacts. And you don't know who flagged in the system after encountering someone positive on the bus (right after going on a marathon at the local glory hole at a gay speakeasy where they encountered 5 positives)</p>

        <p>Sorry about your parents but this was a study of a large group of people and that's where the 18% number comes from. For you personally you and your mom got it from your dad which sucks, but it's not statistically significant compared to the large group size that was researched. Maybe some people are infected more easily than others and you and your mom fall in that category?</p>

        <p>To be quite honest as much as I appreciate the post of this article... I think asymptomatic spread might be way lower than 0.7%, maybe they are mixing that with pre-symptomatic as in when someone is infected but aren't showing symptoms just yet or the symptoms are so mild they shrug it off</p>

        <p>They are mixing it with presymptomatic cases- usually these are lumped in with asymptomatic cases- it’s difficult to separate the two. Only 2 studies have even looked at “presymptomatic”cases separately.</p>

        <p>I was stoked to see this.  I've felt like asympto has been the key excuse to all the human rights abuses raining down on us.</p>
<p>I've been debating an old friend who loves the local college football team and is a die-hard hate the repubs, died in the blue wool dem.  he wrote this:</p>
<p>&rt;" I’m reading both of your references below as counter arguments to your communicated conclusions.  For the medical article, you are pulling an out of context statistic, that is in no way part of the primary study here...and would require further context to make any real social distancing policy around.  For example, is there an asymptomatic timeframe (eg. 12-24hrs before some virus stage) where the virus is exponentially more contagious.  This is the “super spreader” phenomenon, which at least anecdotally appears to be where some asymptomatic person infects a whole bunch of people in a short period.  Maybe they are not contagious for the remainder (if you are reading this correctly, then let’s assume 98%) of their asymptomatic timeframe, but the damage is still done.  There aren’t many people running around with symptoms right now, yet it seems to have essentially infected every part of society that is still interacting outside of households (ie. The White House, literally every single college football team, etc.).  The rest of the article is devoted to essentially documenting that transmissions within households is higher than other common infectious viruses and is a significant contributor to infection (duh!!).  People who sleep in the same bed are more likely to transmit to each other than those who don’t (thank you Dr. Obvious).  The asymptomatic transmission needs more context (ie. Is this timespan based, some momentary contagiousness metric, positive case transmission source metric, etc.).  This isn’t intrinsically clear in the article or the stat you are referencing.  "</p>
