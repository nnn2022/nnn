    <strong>Post 9/11</strong>
    <p><p>Everyone and a while you'll hear people say "pre 9/11" usually in reference to wait times at the airport or the endless wars. The privacy rights that were taken away with the patriot act. Its always pre 9/11 and post 9/11.</p>
<p>It will be the same with covid. Pre covid post covid. Already you hear people using the terms. Years from now you will hear people say "hey remember pre covid when we were able to (fill in the blank)" the blank will guaranteed to be talking about a right that was stripped away. "Her remember pre covid when we could visit grandma in the nursing home?" "Hey remember pre covid when we could all go out to eat together?"</p>
<p>It will be like this unless we choose this moment to fight back. I refuse to live in a post covid world. In several years I just want to look back and say "remember covid? That was fucked wasn't it?"</p></p>

        <p>I am just tired of people using 9/11 as an example of how things go back to normal after tragedy. We never got back to normal after that and never will</p>

        <p>The slippery slope is real, in the olden days people would flee countries like this and risk everything to travel oceans and settle new land in order to be free to organize society as they saw fit. This is essentially how America was born. Today all the land is taken and we are all dépendant so either we will die a slow death one mandate at a time or who knows where this will go</p>
