    <strong>I saw a pro-mask driving fast without a seatbelt</strong>
    <p><p>Today I saw a pro-mask driving fast without a seatbelt in his car. It's one of these people who's vaccinated, but still wearing a mask because of they think the vaccine doesn't prevent spread and only lessen the chance of dying. People can be afraid of things it's a low risk dying of or experience like COVID19, getting hit by the lightning, terrorism and airplanes. But people aren't necessarily afraid of driving fast in cars without a seatbelt. The likelihood dying in a car crash is higher than dying of COVID19 or experiencing a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>I've also seen people cycling with a mask - but no helmet. Other "honorable" examples are pro-lockdown/pro-safety/pro-mask people smoking, eating fast food, drinking alcohol and climbing mountains.</p>
<p>The most common pro-safety hypocrisy I've seen is people driving without a seatbelt, but are in love with their masks.</p></p>

        <p>I’m seeing a lot of pro-maskers riding bikes without helmets lately. There’s almost no chance of giving (or spreading) COVID while outdoors but there’s a huge chance you’ll get hit by a car or crash the bike on your own.....what a crazy world we live in where people are more afraid of COVID than a TBI....</p>

        <p>Where I live there's no outdoor mask mandate and as long you can keep a 2 meters distance most police are happy. Yet they're loving their masks, but don't care about helmets and seatbelts. I don't understand why. 99,97% survival chance with COVID19.</p>

        <p>Best one I ever saw was in a supermarket. Dude was the ultimate in risk aversion: late 50s, double masked, purple nitrile gloves, even had a four point cane which is safer than a normal one. What was he doing at the supermarket? Standing next to the lotto scanner checking Mega Millions with a stack of tickets, couldn't even tell how many, it was a stack best estimated in terms of inches of thickness rather than number of tickets. That is a man who knows how to play it safe.</p>

        <p>My mom was wearing a face diaper in the beginning of March, when no one was, yet she's overweight, doesn't wear a seatbelt, drives recklessly, and has poor hygiene.</p>

        <p>At least I'm internally consistent.  I'm an anti-masker and I drive like a lunatic.</p>
<p>I do wear seatbelts though.  I feel as though driving unbelted gives me too much freedom of movement within the seat, making it difficult to control the vehicle properly.</p>
