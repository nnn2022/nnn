    <strong>Sudden illness.. sudden death..</strong>
    <p><p>Can you guys please help me with an empirical experiment?
I've recently noticed an increase of sudden illnesses (I don't know if in English it is the right term, in my country we use those words in news to define sudden and unexpected death/collapse) in the local news. 
Especially, an increase of car crashes by such events.</p>
<p>Therefore I searched keywords like "sudden illness" on Google news. Then I confronted the occurrences with the same search but in the period 2019/2018. To me, the time span between one news and the another tightens in 2021.</p>
<p>What do you think?
Is it suggestion or the beginning of WWZ scenarios?
Have you had the same impression or can you tell first/second hand tales?</p></p>

        <p>Here on WC US they attributed that to people who put off regular medical care for the past 1.5 years, and now are having serious health issues.</p>
<p>I’m 37 and never has someone my age died of a heart attack. 2 people I went to HS with both had massive heart attacks and died recently. Getting older I suppose, still does not add up for me.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to read this. 
Do you know if they have been vaccinated recently? According to what I (we) have read,  heart failures might be at any time, not necessarily close to the moment of vaccination.</p>

        <p>Nothing indicates to me either one got vaccinated except, we’re in areas that have very high vaccinate rates, and both worked in positions that likely required it. One was a manager in a manufacturing facility, other was a bartender. </p>
<p>The only reason I think it’s connected is only because these guys are 35/36, not in poor health. Maybe that’s normal and I’m getting older, but it does not seem normal to me. </p>
<p>One guy, it was like, a MAJOR heart attack. It’s weird to me. Maybe a stroke or a heart attack, but this was major. Typically happens when plaque buildup breaks free and gets lodged in an artery or something. In my head, heart attack is one thing, 36 year old with a completely blocked artery, presumably no previous heart issues. It’s odd in my head. Seems like a clot caused it.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your report.
30s-40s is a very low age for heart attacks, unless you're obese, for example, so I agree with your clot hypothesis.
Beside, I keep going on with my empirical experiment on Google news. 
I'm noticing lots of people in the range 35-45 that are dying of sudden heart failure in the span of few hours (not local search but country-wide)</p>
<p>So far, it was most common that the victims were into those categories: 
1) workers
2) attorneys 
3) bartenders/restaurant owners</p>

        <p>Thanks for the report. Italy here. For the moment I still have to witness something myself, but sudden deaths are becoming more frequent in local news. 
Zero mentions if the victim was vaccinated or not, in one case, a 34 years old woman died in a restaurant in front of her parents. Article says she suddenly went pale and in a moment she collapsed on the floor, dead. Immediately after the reporter adds "she died of natural causes" even if the autopsy has been disposed but not done yet.</p>
<p>Yeah sure, sudden death at 34 is something natural, nothing to see here.</p>
