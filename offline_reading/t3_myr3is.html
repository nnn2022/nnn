    <strong>Fight the DIVISION... Spread the LOVEðŸ’œ</strong>
    <p><p>THIS WHOLE THING IS ABOUT DIVISION OF HUMANITY! We are all equal from inception and we need to spread nothing but love, compassion and understanding! For, or against, we all come to our conclusion based on every event in our life up until you're forced to form your opinion... Either yes or no. Love love love, spread love and positivity and shine a warm embracing light no matter your opinion.</p></p>

        <p>The only thing I can manage at this point is that I absolutely refuse to call anyone a moron or an idiot and I see this everywhere on a daily basis. I just canâ€™t and I wonâ€™t do it. Even though these people are not open to any sort of productive dialogue or conversation I know what it feels like when they do it to me, it is dehumanizing and it shuts down any kind of communication. Other than that I have no patience anymore. I live in a city surrounded by people who are mentally unstable and completely unable to have a normal conversation without flipping out if you disagree with them. All I can manage at this point is being civil and not agitating them but I feel like Iâ€™m walking on eggshells Constantly and I have to hide my true feelings and opinions. I used to feel sorry for them and pray for them, I canâ€™t even do that anymore. I just want to be away from them, I donâ€™t wanna live around them anymore. I feel outnumbered and I have to constantly remind myself that I am not crazy and itâ€™s not me. That itâ€™s OK to have my feelings on this and that doesnâ€™t make me a bad person.</p>

        <p>I agree with you 100 percent and I feel the same way! I feel like, some days, that I've gone mad and I missed something crucial and I can't see the benefit of getting the jab. I feel outnumbered. People are way to edgy and one sided and unwilling to even attempt to think practically, logically, or even instinctively (common sense)! It's truly unbelievable, also, if the media has taught me (us) anything, its to believe nothing they say and half of what they show you ðŸ™ƒ. Therefore, don't believe when they say that you're the crazy fool for not getting a precious vaccine! How dare you let that vile of decrepit, vile gene mutating garbage go to waste. Take it and shed your spike protein, and share with those you love!</p>

        <p>Exactly!  I feel like I have some sort of weird glitch that makes me immune to the media brainwashing. I immediacy see through it even some things on "my side". As soon as I hear a story or see a report my reaction is always to tick off certain things like OK who is saying this, are there coercive or inventive linguistic techniques being used here or straight facts with reputable sources? Then there is the chain it's coming through... Does the person telling me this have something to gain financially or power wise if I do what they want? Is there another side to what I'm hearing? Are they friends or doing business to others who play into this whole web? </p>
<p>And when someone is deplatformed or banned or the media or public figures say bad or negative things about them I am compelled to listen to them to see why they are so feared and hated. Usually they have proof of something that ruins the mainstream narrative or helps the average person. We are in a time of unprecedented propaganda on such a wide scale you simply can't take what you're hearing at face value. Everything requires interpretation. The fact that I am treated like a piece of garbage because I have questions and I don't believe everything I'm being told tells me there is something very wrong here.</p>
<p>As far as the vaccine, I truly don't understand how we have arrived at a point where I am responsible for everyone else around me. How wanting my life back is selfish. Why I have to make medical decisions based on the health of someone who lives down the block from me. I would never in a million years expect them to do this for me. If they take the vaccine they should be fine. Why am I being coerced into doing this when I don't want it? It's my choice to live my life taking risks. This is a risk I am okay with taking. Why can't I just be left alone? If you are vaccinated and you are taking all of your precautions why do I have to give up bodily autonomy and do whatever you want me to do so you can feel safe? Leave. Me. Alone.</p>

        <p>We are not alone! Many more people than you think are on the same page as you and I! (This will never be mentioned or reported anywhere)</p>
<p>Like, look at how all the numbers have been skewed and manipulated from the start regarding the number of people infected/dying! </p>
<p>Ok... Now think? Would they ever maybe even once dare try and skew the numbers in terms of how many people are actually getting the jab in an effort to convince the nay Sayers that they're out numbered ðŸ˜·ðŸ¤«</p>

        <p>That's true, I saw a few influencers on IG show that they were asked to do posts acting excited about the vaccine... Show themselves getting it and make a big deal out of it. Then I saw people saying the reason celebs and influencers are doing this and there is such a public push and such pressure to do it is because it's not formally approved by the FDA yet therefore the companies are not allowed to advertise it. So they're getting all of this advertising through celebrities and high-profile public figures and influencers. It's all fake and manipulative. I also saw reports today that millions skipped their second dose. Some because of supply issues but others just decided not to get it. It's not all it seems, it's a huge marketing campaign trying to make us feel like murderous creeps if we don't get injected. Not working on me.</p>

        <p>Look regardless of your political affiliation trump won the election. There are more people on the side that is opposite what the media says. So what does that tell you? It might not be verified by sight or feel but the stats say we are actually in the majority.</p>
<p>Okay. I was just reading this book on the warsaw uprising. You know why they were successful? Because they fought back. Seriously everyone should read about this.</p>
<p>Heavily reminded me of the quote about history not repeating but rhyming. Too many similarities!</p>
<p>We don't want to be so far down the line and be like, fuck if we had only not worn masks in the goddamn grocery store we might not be in x scenario. Seriously!!!</p>

        <p>But i got covid from someone else and it may kill me. We expect people to obey the rules of the road to keep other drivers safe. We don't let people play amateur explosive experiments in their backyard in case they blow up their neighbor's. Ok, you don't have to take the vaccine  but then don't share space with everyone else. Live in a vaccine free community or out on your own. I am fine with your freedom to live as you choose. Every community requires we restrict our freedoms to fit in with others. That's what good manners are. That's basic family life. Ever sat at a family gathering with that horrible relative you just can't stand. That's restricting your freedom for others. And it's sometimes painful, as the parent of any 3 year old will tell you. Wanting your life back is not selfish but I suggest not caring about whether some like me lives or dies is a little harsh. I would be terribly upset if my freedom cost you your life? Can't you show me the same concern? Just asking....</p>

        <p>In a word, no. It's not my responsibility to keep you well just as it's not your responsibility to keep me well. You take care of you and I take care of me that's how life works. We've never in history spent our lives obsessing on the health of others. This is not normal. Wearing three masks is not normal. Calling people anti maskers is ridiculous. People who don't wear masks are normal. Everyone's Minds have become so twisted over this past year they have normalized this insane way of living. We are going into our second year of this. I am not dealing with three-year-olds I am dealing with millions of grown adults who need to be responsible for themselves. You cannot control what other people do you can only control what you do. It is completely unrealistic and the height of entitlement and neuroses to expect people to do exactly as you want them to do and to keep you in the Forefront of their minds when deciding how to live their lives.</p>

        <p>Actually if you read the human history of disease we have always imposed social controls to handle them. Read about the lepers exiled into caves in the New Testament. Or blocking off entire villages with the Black Death. In most towns if you got the plague they nailed you into your house. Or enforced quarantine for TB until the 1920's. And social distancing and travel bans during the Spsnish flu.</p>
<p>And we happily control what people do all the time. Try walking naked into Macdonald's. You have been denied the freedom to own slaves, rape children, attack people at random in the street, drive at 100 miles an hour through a playground. You're not allowed to build your own atomic bomb, even if you just want it for display. People only think they have pure freedom until they want to do something they're not allowed to. But society depends on people cooperating together.</p>

        <p>You have to look for different news sources apart from the mainstream. There are other options but the powers that be have a monopoly and complete control of the most widely promoted news outlets. I now look at that as well as independant creators and other platforms that have been portrayed as negative. I learned there's a reason they are portrayed as negative, they go against the mainstream narrative. If you really want to get a more balanced view it's work. It requires listening to more than one or two outlets and having an open mind.</p>
