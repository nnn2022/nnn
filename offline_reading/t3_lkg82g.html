        <p>I think they did. QAnon is stupid as hell. I think they did this just as much as they pushed anti vax hate.</p>
<p>Anti vax is a small small minority of people, I’m all for vaccinations we’ve had for years that have been proven safe. This rushed Covid vax can go kick rocks. It’s blatantly evil how they push so hard to hide the negatives.</p>
<p>If pharmaceutical companies didn’t have to list negative side effects on their advertising you’d see Covid vaccine advertising everywhere on ads. Pretty sure there is a reason we don’t see this advertised and only talked about a news opinion pieces over and over and over</p>

        <p>While I don’t think they made the whole thing up, I think they’re wholly responsible for it seeming like it’s actually ‘a thing’; they built a <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/01/19/democrats-are-more-likely-than-republicans-to-have-heard-of-qanon">straw-man</a> to knock down.</p>

        <p>QAnon exists, but I personally have extremely high confidence that it was an op from the beginning. I was paying close attention and analyzing when those first few posts came out, the posts that were supposedly from the insider Q, meant to cryptically confirm that he was truly an insider as he claimed. Some of the things he forecast, which he told people ahead of time to expect, proceeded to be explicitly referenced by the Trump administration a number of times in the days ahead, and in such a way that I feel absolutely defied random chance. To me it is entirely confirmed that Q was the real deal, in that he authenticated himself in such a way that could not have been accomplished by a random outsider. For some reason a lot of folks then went on to assume this meant he was trustworthy and good, believing all manner of ridiculous nonsense afterward, whereas I personally just went on to assume it was all an op.</p>

        <p>I would be extremely surprised to learn it was a Trump op. I don't expect that anyone at Trump's level of involvement would have access to the level of sophistication necessary to stage it and pull it off. There are bigger players out there. Depending on what you believe, maybe Trump has real enemies, but there's really only two avenues of possibility -- either he has real enemies, or some other players have allowed him to do what he is doing. In both cases it strikes me as completely impossible that he would be able to stage a sophisticated op, with runaway autonomy, alone. Just doesn't make any sense. Also if I recall, the Q stuff started some time before the 2016 election had even taken place at all, which to me, only multiplies the ridiculousness.</p>

        <p>Yes the so called "deep state". There are many, many levels of unelected military and intelligence officials in our behemoth of a bureaucracy, theres a lot of good documentaries about this. Started in the 1980s, now there is no way to reign in these quasi-autonomous organizations, hell the cia basically funds its own operations (iran contra)</p>

        <p>I think it's worth sharing this. </p>
<p>There are two worlds</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Real World</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Narrative World</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We see people like us living in the former, and the doomers living in the latter. The Narrative World is a made up world that's used to control populations, it is full of fictions designed to produce outcomes designed by the ruling class. Similar to that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qedAzTA8nY8">scene in the Matrix</a> except you're not a battery, you're tax cattle. And the Narrative World doesn't have to bear any resemblance to reality, in fact it rarely does -- you just have to snuff out people who promote the Real World.</p>

        <p>&rt; CA woman, 78, gets COVID-19 vaccine, <strong><em>then suddenly dies of something else</em></strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; A 78-year-old California woman died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, <strong><em>but her death doesn’t appear to be linked to the shot, health officials said</em></strong> Saturday.  <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong><em>Officials say there were no signs or symptoms the woman had a severe allergic to the vaccine. Her cause of death is still being determined.</em></strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The woman’s family shared that <strong><em>she had a history of heart illness.</em></strong></p>
<p>Suddenly, co-morbidities in those &rt;75 years old matter when it comes to post-vax deaths, but are of no consequence when it comes to C19 death statistics. Extremely consistent and no gaslighting whatsoever.</p>

        <p>The lack of a consisten train of thought is hilarious though. Dont get the vaccine! It gives you blood clots! You could die! (Which it doesn't btw). But when you mention how covid causes blood clotting and how dangerous that all, yall instantly dismiss it.</p>

        <p>My dad had the vaccine the vaccine yesterday evening and apparently feels like death today.</p>
<p>He is 65 and has had major heart surgery a few years ago so is probably in a high-ish risk group if he actually got Covid (if he hasn't had it already...). But still, a 'safe' vaccine shouldn't make you feel really ill.</p>
<p>He was super keen to get though as soon as he was asked so his fault I guess. Just hope he doesn't die from it...</p>

        <p>I wish him the best. Just a warning, from what I've seen, the second dose is supposed to have worse side effects than the first. If this was his first dose I'd suggest he consult a doctor and tell them how he reacted to the first dose to be sure they feel it's safe for him.</p>

        <p>The headlines are so misleading. “Her cause of death is still being determined.” The article says not determined, different than the headline suggests.</p>
<p>The article seems to be drawing the conclusion it’s not likely related to the injection because she didn’t have typical allergy symptoms. The shot is still a beta test, they should be open minded to new symptoms also.</p>
<p>The old man is probably getting a payout as part of the cover up to get the second dose and not speak ill of the holy injection that will save humanity. If people stop believing, we’ll all die!</p>

        <p>This sub can’t even recognize when a “journalist” is secretly on their team. It’s like the author of this article was trying so hard to insinuate that this woman died from the Covid vaccine, and instead they’re spinning it as someone trying to insist it’s not related. Either that, or the author was bored and wanted to stir up controvery between NNN’ers and non-conspiracists. </p>
<p>And like you said.. there’s literally no evidence to prove it’s related. 78 year olds with heart conditions die all the time; it’s not news worthy by any means.</p>
