        <p>She is being accused of accessing a government computer system after being fired.  She also refused to open the door for 20 min and hung up on the deputy when he called and explained to her they had a warrant.  She also has a criminal history including assault.  Cops showed an incredible amount of patience with her.</p>

<p>Gotta get those guns out.</p>
<p>&rt;She also refused to open the door for 20 min and hung up on the deputy when he called and explained to her they had a warrant.</p>
<p>Do you have video of that?</p>
<p>&rt;She also has a criminal history including assault.</p>
<p>I'm not seeing that, but if you post conviction records I'm all ears.  Not to mention she worked for the Florida government during 2020.</p>

        <p>I agree: This seems like a huge overreaction to send armed cops into this woman's home, point firearms at her and her children, etc.</p>
<p>This does seem like Gestapo tactics where DeSantis, as much as I agree with his no lockdown no mask stance, is acting like a dictator.</p>
