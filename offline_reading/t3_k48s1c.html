    <strong>Why do so many Americans think the federal government owes them something?</strong>
    <p><p>I raised concerns on a local subreddit earlier today about gym and restaurant owners and employees losing their livelihoods because the governor is talking about shutting those businesses down again.</p>
<p>Everything I got in response was the standard HURR DURR MCCONNELL AND TRUMP fare.</p>
<p>Are they good people?  No, they're both assholes.  But, in this instance, they don't owe you anything.  THEY did not shut down businesses in your state, YOUR GOVERNOR did.  Why do people think the federal government has anything whatsoever to do with this?  It's all state-level, if not city-level (as it should be, btw).</p></p>

        <p>Because a spectacularly huge segment of our population are essentially useless people with no work ethic and no productive or valuable skills. They can barely provide enough utility to the world to justify their own food and board, so naturally they think everyone else is to blame and they are owed for their failure to compete.</p>
<p>These people have no idea what it's like to run a business and be responsible for people because there is no universe in which they see themselves actually achieving and creating things for themselves.</p>

        <p>This is spot on.</p>
<p>Source: career psychologist.</p>
<p>ALSO, I'd expand that:</p>
<p>Healthcare is fine.</p>
<p>Education is fine.</p>
<p>Government intervention in healthcare and education is where the problem is.</p>
<p>The other problem is the government has indoctrinated, through public education, entire generations of economically illiterate people that conflate that government fuckery with "capitalism", and then ask for more government without understanding the irony that they're voting away their own money, as well as their employer's ability to pay them more, by "being woke" and "demanding a higher minimum wage", which is a contradiction in itself.</p>
<p>The only way you could have such a contradiction is if you're operating on propaganda not factual information.</p>
<p>And/or have such a low IQ that your undue sense of pride and superiority blocks you from learning, because that requires being incorrect about a previously held assumption.</p>
<p>The line between factual information and propaganda blurs when 4/5 of society parrots the latter because they can't discern the former anyway, thanks to that same lack of actual education by the state they worship.</p>
<p>After a point I can't feel sorry for these people. Like. At all.</p>
<p>Enjoy the decline, and discuss strategies for sanity.</p>

        <p>I totally agree. They want to shut us down again Tmw-Dec. 22. </p>
<p>At this point, yeah. The government better pay my businesses bills and my lost profit. How can I work when  “they” wont let me. </p>
<p>But say that in the other sub, and you get “well, better to be homeless then dead! And you wont starve, that takes 30 days! Go to the food bank” 
Utterly disgusting and psychopathic</p>
<p>Edit: They blame our governor here (AZ) for <em>not</em> being in favor of lockdowns. I am praying he holds his ground! I want to work!</p>

        <p>Of course, I think people should be compensated for their wages in the event of a forced shutdown.  </p>
<p>But when the shutdown is on a state level, the federal government doesn't really have any obligation to get involved.  Instead of blaming their governor for 1) shutting down the state economy in the first place, and 2) leaving them high and dry financially, they just cry about the same old anti-heroes in D.C. whom they think are somehow responsible for every problem in their life.  I swear with some of these people, if their dog got run over they'd find a way to blame Trump and McConnell.</p>

        <p>Most people on reddit are losers and want everybody to be as miserable as them. Most successful people don't go on this website, and if they do they don't spend very long on here. So the clowns you were arguing with are part of the Reddit doomer socialist crowd that wants society to collapse because they have no stake in it anyways. These people are way out there and the same ones you see burning stuff down in Portland every night.</p>
