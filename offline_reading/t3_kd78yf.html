    <strong>I'm back on this sub, and I hate it.</strong>
    <p><p>I deleted my reddit account because for a bit things opened up in my fascist county/state of Santa Clara County, California. I had been going to the gym everyday, meeting up with friend occasionally (I was maskless, although they all had superglues their muzzles to their faces), and overall had my hopes up. Now, restaurants are closed, gyms are closed, and my friends won't even meet up outside, 6 ft apart, with masks. </p>
<p>I'm moving in January to Chicago, which no matter what people say about the city, things are open. They are at a lot reduced capacity, and masks galore, but you can have some resemblance of normal life if you wanted too. I was trying to hold on for just a few weeks longer until I moved and people got stabbed in their arms, but it's hard. So, hello again NoNewNormal!</p></p>

        <p>Hi there friend, I too am a serf under Lord Newsom's grand rule.</p>
<p>I reached my limit months ago but I am stuck here for awhile longer (work related).</p>
<p>Why Chicago if I may ask?</p>
<p>I have been touching myself to fantasies of moving to Florida for months, seems like a better option if you're able?</p>

        <p>I work there haha. My company has been remote since March, with no signs of letting us go back to work. I stayed at home with my parents to save money on rent for a while. Florida is nice, but I have a lot of friends in Chicago and sometimes the city can suck, but overall it's pretty diverse, cheap (relatively), and nice.</p>

        <p>Yeah both Illinois and California are forever blue, but coastal Democrats are very different from Midwest democrats IMO. Much more tolerable, and their love for their city will keep Chicago going, unlike SF or New York.</p>

<p>Huh. Now that I think about it, moving to a predominantly black area might be the best way to avoid dealing with lockdown enforcement (in exchange for other complications, of course).</p>
<p>Can't state my reasoning here (because reddit) but intelligent readers will no doubt arrive at a similar conclusion.</p>

        <p>Huh really? Maybe I’m comparing it to California, so it seems waaay more open. From what I’ve heard restaurants are basically open in those “outdoor” igloos, parks are open, gyms/pools are open. And there are secret parties going on haha which are unheard of here because every 20-something year old here is so anal about the “rules”</p>

        <p>My mom lives in the Bay and I spent some time there in the summer, definitely much better than CA.</p>
<p>Everything you said is true, but you’re also forgetting that the weather makes doing a lot of the things you listed unenjoyable or even impossible. As I type this, it’s below freezing. You don’t want to be doing anything outdoors if you can avoid it. Even the igloos aren’t super warm. I’m from the South so I despise cold weather and I assume you do too.</p>
<p>The underground parties definitely do happen every weekend - a massive one got busted the other day. Seems like you have a network of friends here already. I don’t however so I feel sketched out going to a technically illegal, unannounced party by myself in a city I know very few people in.</p>
<p>If you’re coming here with no existing friends or family, go live somewhere else. For your sanity. Oh and avoid r/chicago at all costs</p>

        <p>I recommend Florida. Better weather, no lockdowns, and the governor ordered law enforcement to not enforce masks. Bars, restaurants, and gyms are packed. People in downtown areas are not wearing face diapers. The general vibe feels really good compared to what I hear from friends in Cali.</p>

        <p>I lived in Chicago and moved out of the city into the suburbs. Specifically because Chicago sucks right now and the mayor is a complete asshole and a big part of the propaganda machine. I apologize becaose I don’t mean to shit on your decision, Chicago can be a beautiful city, but I wouldn’t move here with “feeling normal again” in mind</p>
