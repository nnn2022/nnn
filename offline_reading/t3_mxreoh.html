        <p>Well its a horrible police tactic sending in 20 policeofficers to a crowd of 100's of protestors partying will obviously get a reaction. The police in command who ordered this intervention should be sacked. The commanding officer put both protestors and policeofficers lives at risk. The people going infront of the police officers know what is happening and it has happened countless times so they have to interfere. If not youll get all over the news - VIOLENT CONSPIRACY  PROTESTORS BEAT UP POLICE - which still might happen.</p>

        <p>idk.  I go back and forth on what the proper course is.  On the one hand, I see your point.  On the other, it seems like cops, in general, are less likely to attempt that kind of shit if there are consequences.</p>

        <p>I like this idea that gandhi has of satyagraha - truth force -   to win over their mind and their heart and pursuade them to your point of view.  I reckon one of the most revolutionary acts is helping police officers come into self realisation that they are ordered to surpress freedoms which cannot happen through violence but through dialogue. If it is just met with violence the only reaction will be violence. However I am all for resistance, and self defense. Mindlessly attacking police officers does not help in any way. It has to be tactical. The police have tactics. The people should have their own tactics.</p>

        <p>Not sure how relevant your comment is... Did I say the british left india because of gandhi? Are you saying the british are the police and India is the people and gandhi played no part in the british ( police ) leaving? Maybe thats for another discussion which is quite intersting. Don't get me wrong  I am critical of gandhi aswell, he believed africans should be secondclass citizens. Both SA and Ghana have toppled statues by gandhi. I however would rather talk about what is happening now and I welcome criticism of satyagraha and my views on how to deal with police. Dyou reckon people should actively be violent towards the police?</p>

        <p>if a random dude was trying to hit you with a club, would you hit back? If you would, why wouldn't you do it if it was a cop?  If some random dude tried to push you out of the park and told you to go home, what would you do?  My point is, when cops are enforcing the dictates of elites, they no longer deserve the badge and should just be treated like any random gang or psycho.</p>

        <p>Yes but random gang or psycho can't arrest you or make your life miserable. The big fella in the video trying to get people not to be violent towards the police got arrested for "being violent" in another event. What happens when they arrest you and you are overly animated borderline aggressive? They call the psychiatrist, they try to put you in a psych ward. call you conspiracy theorist. they stress you, they use inhumane manipulative ways in order to charge you with something. Don't believe that the police are just random citizens, they have the govt, private companies, lawyers judges all behind them and will use against you with full force. What do average people have? A lawyer provided by the state? It's a joke. Which is why people do not get involved in arrests. Also on another note, police are known to hire agent provocateurs in order to increase violence and paint the protestors in bad light. They plant old unregistered police vans so the more violent lot light it up. The police don't try to stop them, they smile and watch as their van burns up. It is not as simple as it appears. Point again is to converse with the police. You need the police to realise and understand that they are "supposed" to protect and serve the people, not the state. The police in britain are not like the french, are not trained like the germans, or the swiss police. THey are not as violent as the spanish or crazy as the U.S police. The british also are not as violent in their protests as all those other countries. So IMO they should try as hard as they can to create dialogue as well as to show, share the injustices and the illegality of the arbitary police force actions. This is my own belief. There is always a chance of violence in a protest, and it might become even worse.  The police and the media will try as hard as they can to paint protestors as violent nutcases. I reckon we should avoid that road.</p>

        <p>I'm saying that Gandhi wasn't effective in getting what he wanted so suggesting/implying his strategies would work now is a hard argument to make. MLK, likewise, wasn't effective outside of his bus boycott. People got changes because they were burning cities down.</p>
<p>&rt;Dyou reckon people should actively be violent towards the police?</p>
<p>No. I think large numbers of people should stop paying taxes and go on a tax strike.</p>
