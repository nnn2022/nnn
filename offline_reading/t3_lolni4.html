        <p>Sorry, yes you’re correct, I phrased it completely wrong. They are at a higher risk of complications from the shot. However the risk/reward ratio is better than not having it all together. But a novel virus inoculation is going to be much higher risk, as we saw with the Pfizer vaccine in Norway. </p>

        <p>Let's say there are 30 million people who got the vaccine, and 500 died in the next month (after getting the vaccine) of ANY cause.  Let's say there are 30 million people who tested positive for Covid and 500,000 died in the next month (after testing positive) of ANY cause. These numbers are not precise but close to accurate.  Why is it hypocritical for people to think that the 500 deaths were unrelated while the 500,000 deaths probably were not?</p>

        <p>It’s just an expression, I don’t believe in the majority of points made on this subreddit so in my eyes it feels like I’m “loosing brain cells” or becoming more stupid. But just because I don’t believe it that doesn’t mean there’s no scientific evidence to back up both ends, so I encourage you to believe in exactly what you want to believe in!</p>

        <p>I know what the phrase means...but what do you make of the fact that the CDC has been artificially inflating the death numbers for the past year?  It pretty much backs up the point of the OP.  All that's left is showing that the mainstream establishment does the opposite when it comes to people dying after being vaccinated.  Which, if you notice, the skepticism is quite strong...they usually will say something "there is no proof that the vaccine is the cause of death."   But you would never hear them say that about COVID deaths.  Hence the point of the meme.  No reason to lose brain cells when it depicts what's actually going on.</p>

        <p>Comorbidities are common in all forms of death. Patients with life threatening stages of AIDS die from a lowered ability to fend off secondary infections, like from SARS-CoV-2. Cancer patients die from organ failure. If your lungs fail while you are infected with COVID-19 did you not die with a lung infection? You can ask a doctor to deduce with every person they treated which ones they likely think lost the battle for their life primarily from a specific virus they cannot see but that is not medicine, that is not science. 
The vaccine is safe. You have an immune reaction afterward and this makes you feel sick. The reward far outweighs the risk for the vast majority of people. Sometime people have an allergic reaction to things that are injected... especially things designed to trigger your immune system. Wait for 20 minutes after your shot. If you have a reaction then take the epi pen. If you do not you will be fine. Good day. Apologies for the rant.</p>

        <p>You say it is not safe but then try and prove that by saying there are side effects and you are worried they haven’t been tested for long enough. Sounds reasonable. A reasonable person would then ask how the three approved vaccine were developed so quickly, what the side effects are and why the fuck other diseases don’t get the same VIP treatment as COVID-19. If you want I can point you toward the resources you want. Just ask the questions</p>

<p>The decision to speed up this vaccine was an economic one, not a health or altruistic one.</p>

        <p>Are you trying to say the pharmaceutical companies cut corners to speed up the development and approval process? Otherwise why would increasing the speed of production be problematic? It’s pretty obvious that pharmaceutical companies have financial incentive to be first... I would say it’s pretty amazing that every safety and efficacy concern was addressed, followed up and reviewed by regulatory agencies in record time. MHRA, EMA and the FDA have stated that the vaccines have followed the standard regulatory protocol at an accelerated rate. MHRA implemented a rolling review procedure where the regulatory agency reviewed the safety and efficacy results as they were produced opposed to conducting the review after all of the data was collected and submitted. In all pretty cool to see a global effort  involving 10s of thousands of people ramp up the testing of vaccines and now the production and distribution of them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you claim that it's not 'science' to say that a vaccine-induced death was due to the vaccine.  </p>
<p>There literally is no logic there.  You're just trying to cherry pick how you want things to be perceived.  That is very much <strong>NOT</strong> 'science.</p>

        <p>I can't defend the car crash one but both cancer and aids make people immunocompromised meaning that they could potentially die from even the common cold making the corona virus extremely dangerous for these people. I know no one wants to admit it but it's our responsibility as a community to lookout for those who are at a higher risk. Wearing masks is extremely annoying at times and lockdown is shitty but these are measures in place to keep millions of people safe and eliminate the virus before it kills more people or mutates into a more dangerous version. This is all temporary but people not being careful will only cause the lockdown to last longer.</p>
<p>In the case of vaccination deaths there has been 350 reported deaths post vaccination with 181 of those being unverified (due to the US data being user submitted). The United States, Spain, Germany, Norway, Belgium, and Peru have all done their own investigations and none of them have found any links between the vaccine and death. In most cases the patient died due to covid before the vaccine took effect (it takes about 2 weeks for the vaccine to take effect) and the remainder died of pre-existing conditions. Overall 37 million have been vaccinated with no issues.</p>
<p>I'm open to hearing other opinions I just wanted to give my two cents after following this sub for only a little bit.</p>

        <p>It sounds like youre blaming the wrong people and not looking at the real problem being that the lockdowns arent serious enough and your government dosent care about its people enough to do things it has to. A few countrys took care of their people correctly and now they have 0 new cases for months.</p>

<p>Simply false.  And the countries that do have the lowest number of cases (New Zealand, Taiwan, etc.) are almost all small, island nations that have massive geographic factors working in their favor.  Much easier to control your borders when you're a tiny island with a population that's ~3-8% of the United States.</p>

        <p>&rt;Wearing masks is extremely annoying </p>
<p>Masks aren't needed in the first place.</p>

<p>Even so, they're ineffective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial?_amp=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Overall, 95 of the 4,862 volunteers who made it to the end of the study became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That’s an infection rate of just under 2%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/">Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.</a></p>

<p>Note: The interview with Michael Osterholm is probably the best starting point for persuading doomers that masks are useless.  For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.  But about seven months ago, before the science behind masks became politicized, Osteholm explained in detail why masks are largely useless.</p>

<p>Note: Published in one of the oldest and most prestigious medical journals in the world.  Key quote: "We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."</p>
<p>And no, at worst it's not an inconvenience. It's dangerous.</p>

<p>Masks aren't needed, don't work, and at worst make you sick with bacterial pneumonia which has the ability to give you lasting lung damage.</p>
<p>Anyone saying to wear a mask is anti Science, and a threat to society.</p>

        <p>If you would actually take time to read some of your articles that you posted you would see that some contradict your points and other articles also even prove why in some instances masks in some situations don't perform well but due to other factors and not mask itself. Now, to produce bullshit, like you and other morons in this subreddit do, there is less energy needed produce bullcrap than to refute all of this, read Brandolinis law, so I'm not going to waste my additional time on someone like you BUT, cmon, man, there isn't hidden catch somewhere, no one trying to control someone with covid, governments are just trying to control covid by any means necessary and theyre doing it by something that works and from data we can see that quarantines and masks WORK.</p>

        <p>Okay sure, actually, ye, i was kinda wrong, all I had to do was google "mask data" and most of articles are in favour of me.</p>
<p>*An investigation of a high-exposure event, in which 2 symptomatically ill hair stylists interacted for an average of 15 minutes with each of 139 clients during an 8-day period, found that none of the 67 clients who subsequently consented to an interview and testing developed infection. The stylists and all clients universally wore masks in the salon as required by local ordinance and company policy at the time.
In a study of 124 Beijing households with &rt; 1 laboratory-confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mask use by the index patient and family contacts before the index patient developed symptoms reduced secondary transmission within the households by 79%.</p>
<p>*A retrospective case-control study from Thailand documented that, among more than 1,000 persons interviewed as part of contact tracing investigations, those who reported having always worn a mask during high-risk exposures experienced a greater than 70% reduced risk of acquiring infection compared with persons who did not wear masks under these circumstances.</p>
<p>*A study of an outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, an environment notable for congregate living quarters and close working environments, found that use of face coverings on-board was associated with a 70% reduced risk.</p>
<p>*Investigations involving infected passengers aboard flights longer than 10 hours strongly suggest that masking prevented in-flight transmissions, as demonstrated by the absence of infection developing in other passengers and crew in the 14 days following exposure.<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html">Source</a></p>
<p>*One category of evidence comes from laboratory studies of respiratory droplets and the ability of various masks to block them. An experiment using high-speed video found that hundreds of droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers were generated when saying a simple phrase, but that nearly all these droplets were blocked when the mouth was covered by a damp washcloth. Another study of people who had influenza or the common cold found that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduced the amount of these respiratory viruses emitted in droplets and aerosols.<a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">Source</a></p>
<p>*This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7293850/">Source</a></p>
<p>*Lockdown therefore appears to have been successful not only in alleviating the burden on the intensive care units of the two most severely affected regions of France, but also in preventing uncontrolled epidemics in other regions.Source: https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)32034-1/fulltext</p>

        <p>I have read my articles. Yes, some of the conclusions that the reaserchers come to contradict the data in their study in order for them to keep their jobs. However the data doesn't lie.</p>
<p>Masks and quarantines have no proof of working. On top of that, the WuFlu isn't deadly enough to warrant a single precaution. If you think lives matter, you should be trying to ban high calorie foods that kill far more people a year due to the obesity epidemic. 17.9 million people globally die from cardiovascular issues, which can be prevented in most cases by being fit. </p>
<p>You want to pretend like you care about lives? I won't believe you until you ban McDonald's, Coke, Pepsi, All chocolate, all cakes and cookies, implement a fat tax, subsidize gym memberships, and legally require a doctor's visit twice a year in order to reevaluate the contribution to the fat tax. </p>
<p>Afterall if it saves just one life, right? Fuck personal choice abd responsibility. Because some people aren't able to enjoy foods in moderation, everyone needs to be punished. </p>
<p>While we're at it, mandatory speed governors on all cars and trucks to limit speeds to 30 km/h, all water based activities should be banned, all contact sports are banned. Goodbye superbowl and hello chess tournament.</p>
<p>Afterall, if it just saves one life.</p>

        <p>Yes, youre right, this is interesting dilemma, what certain things do we need to take away from people to protect them for it but its very complicated. But you have to take in account that things you mentioned arent as fast killingl as coronavirus, thats why people arent fighting those issues as much, eating mcdonalds everyday doesnt kill other people but not wearing mask or not isolating could. In an ideal world, nothing would be banned because everyone would do the right thing. And it would be awesome but we dont live in an ideal world, if we did this thing would have been already over. Covid19 shows that many people cant do right thing on their own, in my country, one government was at its end of term, it didnt want to hurt its chances of reelection so it kept things relaxed. When I saw night clubs open at the time and people full of them, I was just, dissapointed. But that changed when the government wasnt reelected and new government put up strictest measures our country has ever seen and cases started finally decreasing. Whats sad is the death count. Usually couple people die due to flu per year in our country, you hear it on the news when it happens. Now, 10-20 or more people were dying everyday... ( I dont live in a big country).</p>

        <p>Few issues here. </p>
<p>Speed doesn't matter. Deaths/year matter. Aids can take years to kill a person. Should we stop caring about AIDS?</p>
<p>While obesity may not be contagious in the traditional sense, it's irresponsible to claim that it doesn't spread. Fat normalization causes more people to be ok with being fat, which causes more people to be fat, etc. A fat kid would have been billed in the 70s. Now skinny kids can be bullied just as easily. </p>
<p>The WuFlu never started. Deaths are multiplied by counting anyone with similar symptoms. The test can be up to 95% inaccurate. Calling this a pandemic is just wrong, even the virus itself needed a media campaign to get people's attentions. Tuberculosis killed 1.4 million in 2019. Where's the lockdowns for that? Afterall, we locked down well before a million deaths were hit. </p>
<p>There's not a single reason night clubs shouldn't be opened. If you don't want to get sick, don't go. </p>
<p>Morso, lockdowns are asinine, brain-dead solutions that aren't shown to work. Morso, your WuFlu deaths are likely deaths with the WuFlu, not from.</p>

        <p>You weren’t being hostile so I thought I would respond to you and give you the benefit of the doubt here. </p>
<p>People who are immunocompromised are absolutely at higher risk for everything, but that does not change the fact that covid would be a secondary cause of death in these patients. Had they not been immunocompromised they would most likely not have died, which means their initial health issue is ultimately the reason for their passing. If covid were ACTUALLY the primary COD then it would be killing those who are not compromised indiscriminately and therefore, the fatality rate would be much higher. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, mask wearing in society is not done properly so the masks just end up being another disease vector that we don’t need. </p>
<p>There have been multiple viruses that have met pandemic criteria historically so the CDC, WHO, etc have, prior to 2020, come out with reports and articles on their recommendations for non-pharmaceutical interventions in the case of a pandemic. Lockdown is not something that has been suggested. In reports where it has been, however, they stress that locking down for more than 4-6 weeks is not beneficial because 1. if it was going to work it would have worked by that point and 2 they are smart enough to understand the far reaching negative implications on other areas of society and recognize they are not justifiable. </p>
<p>When a virus mutates, that generally means it becomes more transmissible but less deadly, so it is a good sign. It implies the initial virus has not been lethal in most people, it is being fought off and needs to mutate in order to survive. Viruses need a viable host. </p>
<p>Stating that this is “only temporary” when we’re a year into this and have politicians stating mask mandates will be in effect til 2022 is insulting and naive honestly. Considering tomorrow isn’t promised for anyone that’s a hell of a long time to be wasting away locked inside your home. </p>
<p>Someone already mentioned how you will accept pre-existing conditions as a valid reason for death when it comes to the vaccine but fail to see how that applies when we are talking about a covid death. It’s hypocritical and makes no sense. </p>
<p>What you also have to understand is people are being coerced and bombarded into getting this vaccine, when the majority of the population does not need it. The virus is not something we can control and are inflicting on others - it’s simply nature. The vaccine however is a different story. People don’t need to be suffering ill effects from a vaccine that is not even necessary for them. That is where I have a serious issue. </p>
<p>I get it’s hard to look at things from a perspective you haven’t explored but it will only benefit you.</p>

        <p>&rt; I know no one wants to admit it but it's our responsibility as a community to lookout for those who are at a higher risk.</p>
<p>So isolate the people that are at risk and let the rest of us live our fucking lives.  You <strong>cannot</strong> justify tanking the global economy the way we have for a virus that, overall, has a 0.2% infection fatality rate, meaning 99.8% of people that get COVID, survive it.  Even for the highest risk category (70+), 95% of those people still survive the virus.</p>
<p>There is <strong>no</strong> excuse for the unhinged way we've responded to this virus globally.  None.</p>

        <p>So if AIDS destroyed their immune system and Covid delivered the final blow, which one was the cause of death? They wouldn’t have died if they didn’t have AIDS but Covid could’ve been swapped out for a common cold and it would still be a death sentence. I think AIDS caused the death.</p>

        <p>You're preaching in the wrong place these people wont get it when they've gone this far out of their way to continue being selfish over minor inconveniences. If they cared the US might not be the most dangerous and (just in general, worst) first world country.</p>
