    <strong>Bad Day at Work</strong>
    <p><p>I work for an essential retailer office supply store, and have been there for six years part time now. I also have a full time job elsewhere, and have worked the whole time during the pandemic. I am a 49 year old female. I didn't have the greatest day, because corporate pulled a complete Jim Crow. What that means is that in order to ditch your mask at work, you have to be fully vaccinated, religious exemptions and medical reasons for not receiving the vax doesn't count. I think that is not fair at all. Corporate can easily check a church to see if an employee is a member, or a dr.s note to prove of a medical condition or allergy to exempt them from having to wear a mask. Back in mid March, we had a huge sale on chairs to the point where almost every customer bough a chair, and they missed a huge sale in February. It was a funny day as the manager on duty and the rest of us were joking and laughing to no end about the whole thing. Then the letter came encouraging us to get the vax. I didn't want to, and asked if I had to. He said highly recommended and asked me to get on the registry. I mentioned that there will be a massive wait so don't be surprised if I don't get it by mid May. I looked online only to find out that by law, employers can force you to take it. Shit, I thought. I decided to pick a Thursday night to sign up, because I thought that the end of the week would cause a delay. The next day Friday, March 26, after work, I had to go online to renew my license plate sticker for my vehicle. When I was done, I found an e-mail from the Wisconsin Health Dept. I opened it, and froze. I had to take an appointment at a drive thru, that next Tuesday, March 30 for J&amp;J! Luckily, I am off Wednesdays, just in case. I was scared shitless, and talked to my Dad about it. Me and Dad both voted for Trump BTW. Unfortunately, for me at the time, my Dad was also pushing for me to get it, because he had no problem when he got his. When I went back to work the Saturday before, people knew by the look in my eyes I was scared. They were supportive, but said I would be fine, so I joked. OK, if I am not in next Saturday, it means I am dead. I have driven in plenty of blizzards, but that Tuesday, I felt like I was driving to my execution! I had panic attacks and had to fight from hyperventilating in the car. I got my shot, then contacted my sister and talked for the 20 minutes, then took off. I had insomnia that night and after tossing and turned to get to sleep. The next morning, I had a sore arm and mild body aches, and more panic attacks. I drove to the Dr. he checked my vitals and said I was fine. He prescribed me a mild T, and after that I was fine. I ended up shopping on that day off. At the mall, older people who were still <br>
waiting for an appointment asked me how in the hell I qualified.  I stated I at least wanted to wait and was unsure, but I got a letter from my company. As of now, I don't regret taking it. I was nervous for a while, but it turned out to be fine. I have a stepsister who I am close to who doesn't want hers. I understand about side effects and adverse reactions and can see why she is hesitant, much less wanting her kids to get it yet. I plan on seeing her on Father's Day, and it doesn't matter to me if they don't wear a mask. Most people have common sense enough to determine if they are sick enough to stay home. I still visited them on Thanksgiving without distancing or masking, eventhough our stupid officials banned visiting on Thanksgiving! I never got COVID and neither did they. I also took vitamin D and zinc as well. One thing that I don't like is the "I don't know" part as of today when trying to find out if we need boosters. In closing, I don't think forcing people with medical reasons for not getting vaccinated or religious exemptions to mask if they are not ill is fair. Sorry about the long post, but I had to vent!</p></p>

        <p>Sorry for your rough time lately. What's ridiculous to me is the whole agenda of forcing unproven and non-FDA approved vaccines, essentially mass experimentation, onto people through methods of coercion.. which is illegal. So much for a free country. I'm not anti Vax, just had a tetanus shot the other day, but this is different.</p>

        <p>Don't really understand, you didn't want to take it but took it anyway? Hopefully not by coercion alone but it sounds like it was. Well hopefully you give up any doubt, that choice was a permanent one so it wouldn't be of use to you now. I hope that was a consideration for you</p>

        <p>Well, I didn't want neither COVID nor the VAX at the time.  I just wanted to bury my head in the sand and wish the problem would go away.  I guess I had to choose the lesser of two evils. What I am wondering now, is how come cases of COVID are plummeting now?</p>

        <p>When my job started pulling this kind of stuff I walked out. </p>
<p>I need to get a new job soon but I would rather make 13 -15 hr pushing carts in a parking lot or stocking groceries than deal with it.</p>
<p>I sincerely wish you luck though ❤️</p>

        <p>I am not that worried about the vax anymore, except that we don't know if we need boosters yet, and I already laminated my card.   If worse comes to worse, I guess I will have to carry two or more cards if we need boosters.  LOL I have an anxiety disorder and depression in the winter, and the lockdown did more harm than good.</p>
