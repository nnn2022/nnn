    <strong>Rant about general population</strong>
    <p><p>It is not true that most people want the epidemic to be ended. Most people like the current political situation very much. Most people wholeheartedly supported the introduction of lockdowns, restrictions and restrictions, and will defend this status quo to the end. Because most of the so-called society is nothing but ordinary, smelly cattle with a slave mentality - and the present times are a fulfillment of their innermost dreams.</p>
<p>This is what they wanted, global totalitarianism - and they got it. Because they hate freedom, they don't want it, they are afraid of it, and they are happy when someone takes it from them. After all, there are so many temptations in this world, so many traps ... In addition, what is worse, in life sometimes you have to make a choice and then bear its consequences. A scary thing for them.</p>
<p>External world is terrifying to them, they cannot find themselves in it; only covid and covidianism offer them what they really want. Simple instructions. Sit on your ass. Don't leave home. Wear a muzzle. Curfew from x hour to y hour. Simple commands, as to a dog.</p>
<p>Finally, they know how to live, how to fill their time, and finally the meaning of life is explained to them (they live to be vaccinated). That the economy is destroyed - they don't care, because they live off social benefits anyway. That it is forbidden to travel, that cultural and musical events were liquidated – they do not give a damn, because they do not travel anywhere, and they do not attend any cultural events, and now they have fun that others cannot either. It’s Schadenfreude – happiness from someone else's suffering – “It doesn’t matter that I suffer, the only important thing is that neighbor suffers more”</p>
<p>Covidianism feeds on the vilest human instincts, fear and envy. And that's why cattle will defend this covid to the end. Because people simply need a whip over themselves. There used to be a Cold War whip and a nuclear arsenal hanging overhead - and now there is a covid whip, used well on the same principles. If covid was not there, it would have to be invented ...</p></p>

        <p>I also don't travel and I don't do cultural or music events anymore and a lot of other stuff I used to do, but that is because THEY are present everywhere. And I don't identify with more than 90% of them.</p>

        <p>I noticed the other day the absolute irony of Western religions &amp; their patronizing language in the vein of, “the lord is my shepherd.”</p>
<p>They don’t realize or want to admit that the shepherd only protects the sheep so he can slaughter them later at his leisure.  Further point: lamb is tastier than mutton, so guess who suffers/is preyed upon most by both religion &amp; government?</p>
<p>So, you’re onto something here with the whole “society is nothing but ordinary, smelly cattle” sentiment.  Veal is tasty too. </p>
<p>Herd mentality literally reshapes the human brain to be passive &amp; supine in the face of danger, trusting some self-appointed “leader” to take care of them without thinking about ulterior motives.  The use of a Judas lamb/goat/etc. is also apparent in the vaccine martyrs who put on a show of getting the jab (which is often only harmless saline, for the sake of a safe photo-op). </p>
<p>We’re becoming the least religious generation on record, &amp; the oligarchs in charge just can’t have that. They needed some other way to control us, so voilá, pandemic.  It all tracks.</p>

        <p>society has conditioned men to be weak.  Weak men want safety and security and cannot provide for themselves.  They are doormats to their wives, their bosses, they are unskilled, overweight, weak, and transitioning to women.  </p>
<p>There's a reason testosterone is still illegal. It will create too many leaders. Too many critical independent thinkers.</p>

        <p>Exactly why I’ve decided to go incognito IRL.  Wearing masks, telling people I’m vaxxed. Repeating libtard lies.  I don’t want to help them anymore.  The sooner they end up with their 2nd shots the better.</p>
