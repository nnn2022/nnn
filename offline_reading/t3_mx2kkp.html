    <strong>Honest question: So what makes the vaccine bad, anyway?</strong>
    <p><p>I realized lately that the belief I have that the vaccine is untested or dangerous has built up slowly without a lot of research.</p>
<p>The problem is that the proven censorship makes it hard for evidence to show up where I can find it. However, just because something would be removed if it does exist doesn't automatically mean it's true.</p>
<p>So I wanted to ask -- why do you believe what you believe about the vaccine? Where did you learn what shaped your opinion?</p></p>

        <p>The fact that it's being pushed so hard is already questionable. If it was a legit vaccine for a legit virus we would get vaxxed from our own will, not the other way around.
Add to that the thousands of stories on social media of people having life changing side effects and deaths from the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Specifically, it caused their blood to be super thin with a low platelet count and they still had a clot. That is what is concerning, not clots overall.</p>

        <p>I choose to believe these "morons" more than the government as I know someone who was hospitalized after the jab and needed an operation and this wasn't reported at all. My dad's uncle also died shortly after the vaccine (had a kidney failure) and he had no underlying conditions. Everyday there is stronger evidence that the vax is not what the media says it is</p>

        <p>My belief comes from my own gut feeling or instinct. </p>
<p>You can tell me over and over that the vaccine is safe as can be but how the hell do you know that with such little time and testing? </p>
<p>Typically vaccines or medication go through so much testing/research before they can even be brought to the table and you want me to take a vaccine that was thrown together in less than a year? No thanks.</p>
<p>I encourage anyone who wants it to take it. Myself I had covid, yea it sucked but I survived. I’ll take my chances with my immune system over this vaccine.</p>

        <p>Because I spent time looking and couldnt find any other vaccines that have uterine bleeding as a side effect.  I'm not calling them "period" side effects anymore because postmenopausal women do not have "periods" so I think whatever these women (of any age) are experiencing is not their period. </p>
<p>Gardasil-4 (not the current popular one) several years ago had one study i found about menstrual changes but it was only based on a few cases and they were all menstrual-aged women, and it wasnt very compelling. That is the only other vaccine that I have found that had any association with uterine bleeding. The fact that this just DOES NOT HAPPEN with other vaccines is pretty informative that these ones <strong>are different</strong></p>

        <p>Also the “effects on fertility: unknown” bit combined with the uterine bleeding and odd reproductive symptoms is terrifying. </p>
<p>As someone who wants kids sometime in the next few years, it’s a no from me. If they can come back in 5 years and state, truthfully, without any sort of bias or anything skewing their reporting, that there are no long term effects including on fertility, then maybe things change a bit. For now with this weird shit and no way whatsoever of knowing if there are long term effects, no thank you.</p>

        <p>I just love how “it’s safe” is said as fact. With every other vaccine, I (or my parents when I was younger) talked to my doctor and discussed whether they were safe for me and necessary. I remember when Gardasil first came out and my doctor told my mom and I to wait it out a bit. Suddenly that’s not a thing anymore, and just because it’s not killing (most) people on the spot, it’s 100% safe and not a discussion? I tried to talk to my doctor and all he said was this is necessary to protect myself and others and that it’s safe. When I brought up that long term effects aren’t known, I was fed an “it’s safe” yet again. Not knowing if it’ll fuck me up years down the road isn’t safe, and why does this not merit an actual discussion between a patient and doctor like all other medical decisions? Instead we’re all spoon fed the same bullshit lines and our concerns quieted. </p>
<p>I also love how the new narrative is “covid has long term effects for many people, would you rather deal with this than risk the small chance of long term vaccine effects?”  Diseases and their effects are a normal part of life and always have been, being forced to inject yourself with something that may harm you down the road is not. I’ll take natural long term effects over anything vaccine caused</p>

        <p>And you can feasibly avoid covid or reduce your odds/viral load if you can't avoid it completely. You can't avoid the shot if you choose to get the shot, thats preposterous on the face of it.

        <p>The International Journal of Clinical Practice:</p>
<p>“COVID‐19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID‐19 disease via antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID‐ 19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials.”</p>
<p>“The risk of ADE in Covid-19 vaccines is non-theoretical and compelling”</p>
<p>“Clinical trials of vaccine candidates have only been designed around immunogenicity as an efficacy end point and have not been designed to capture exposure of subjects to circulating virus after vaccination, which is when ADE/immunopathology is designed to occur. Thus, the absence of ADE evidence in COVID‐19 vaccine data so far does not absolve investigators from disclosing the risk of enhanced disease to vaccine trial participants, and it remains a realistic, non‐theoretical risk to the subjects.”https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijcp.13795</p>
<p>Vaccine Journal</p>
<p>“Examples of vaccine-induced enhancement of susceptibility to virus infection or of aberrant viral pathogenesis have been documented for infections by members of different virus families. Several mechanisms, many of which still are poorly understood, are at the basis of this phenomenon.”</p>
<p>“Vaccine-induced enhancement has been a major stumble block in the development of certain flavi-, corona-, paramyxo-, and lentivirus vaccines.” https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19022319/</p>
<p>Nature Microbiology Journal:</p>
<p>“Antibody-based drugs and vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are being expedited through preclinical and clinical development. Data from the study of SARS-CoV and other respiratory viruses suggest that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could exacerbate COVID-19 through antibody- dependent enhancement (ADE). Previous respiratory syncytial virus and dengue virus vaccine studies revealed human clinical safety risks related to ADE, resulting in failed vaccine trials”</p>
<p>“For non-macrophage tropic respiratory viruses such as RSV and measles, non- neutralizing antibodies have been shown to induce ADE and ERD by forming immune complexes that deposit into airway tissues and activate cytokine and complement pathways, resulting in inflammation, airway obstruction and, in severe cases, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. These prior observations of ADE with RSV and measles have many similarities to known COVID-19 clinical presentations.” https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00789-5</p>
<p>PLOS Journal:</p>
<p>“SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS- CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2- type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.”</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22536382/</p>
<p>Nature Journal:</p>
<p>“Before allowing use of a COVID-19 vaccine in humans, regulators should evaluate safety with a range of virus strains and in more than one animal model.”</p>
<p>“Work with the SARS virus shows that worrying immune responses were seen in ferrets and monkeys, but not in mice. Also, some viral protein fragments can elicit more potent or less risky immune responses than others, and it makes sense to learn this in animal studies before trying them in people.”https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00751-</p>
<p>Journal of Veterinary Medical Science: vaccine developed against another coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), increased cats’ risk of developing the disease caused by the virus. Survival rate for vaccinated cats dropped to 50%, while that of the unvaccinated cats remained at 100%</p>
<p>“In this study, when cats passively immunized with anti-FIPV-I KU-2 antibodies were orally inoculated with FIPV-I KU-2, FIP was caused at a 50% probability, i.e., FIPV not causing FIP through oral infection caused FIP by inducing antibody-dependent enhancement.”</p>
<p>“The survival rate of cats with passive immunization was lower than that of the cats without passive immunization, and the average survival time after infection with FIPV-I KU-2 was also shorter.”https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jvms/81/6/81_18-0702/_pdf/-char/en</p>
<p>Clinical and Vaccine Immunology Journal:
“In 1967, infants and toddlers immunized with a formalin-inactivated vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) experienced an enhanced form of RSV disease characterized by high fever, bronchopneumonia, and wheezing when they became infected with wild-type virus in the community. Hospitalizations were frequent, and two immunized toddlers died upon infection with wild-type RSV.”https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189</p>
<p>The Lancet Journal:</p>
<p>“We are writing to express concern about the use of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vector for a COVID-19 phase 1 vaccine study, and subsequent advanced trials. Over a decade ago, we completed the Step and Phambili phase 2b studies that evaluated an Ad5 vectored HIV-1 vaccine administered in three immunisations for efficacy against HIV-1 acquisition. Both international studies found an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition among vaccinated men.” https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32156-5/fulltext</p>

<p>Journal of Virology: coronavirus vaccine provided incomplete protection in mice and resulted in significant complications</p>
<p>“In addition to the general failure of the DIV or DIV-plus-alum vaccines to elicit protective immunity against heterologous SARS viruses or to provide protection even against homologous viral challenge in aged animals, both the DIV and DIV-plus-alum vaccine formulations result in significantly enhanced immune pathology within the lungs compared to control animals. Although adjuvanted DIV protected young animals from morbidity and mortality following lethal challenges, the heterologous virus, icHC/SZ/ 61/03-S, induced a lung pathology that was more severe in vaccinated than in unvaccinated mice”</p>
<p>“In each of the experiments conducted here, immunization with the whole inactivated SARS vaccine induced increased inflammatory infiltrates and pulmonary eosinophilia upon subsequent challenge, demonstrating the potential for dangerous clinical complications. This is consistent with two prior studies of vaccine formulations incorporating SARS N, where N-specific immune responses resulted in enhanced eosinophilic immune pathology.” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3209347/</p>
<p>Journal of Analytical Chemistry:</p>
<p>“Circulating antibodies (Ab) that specifically bind polyethylene glycol (PEG), a biocompatible polymer routinely used in protein and nanoparticle therapeutics, have been associated with reduced efficacy of and/or adverse reactions to therapeutics modified with or containing PEG.”</p>
<p>“We unexpectedly found, with 90% confidence, detectable levels of anti-PEG Ab in ∼72% of the contemporary specimens.”</p>
<p>“The widespread prevalence of pre-existing anti-PEG Ab, coupled with high Ab levels in a subset of the population, underscores the potential importance of screening patients for anti-PEG Ab levels prior to administration of therapeutics containing PEG.” https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03437</p>
<p>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery Journal:</p>
<p>“Exogenous mRNA is inherently immunostimulatory, as it is recognized by a variety of cell surface, endosomal and cytosolic innate immune receptors. Depending on the therapeutic application, this feature of mRNA could be beneficial or detrimental. It is potentially advantageous for vaccination because in some cases it may provide adjuvant activity to drive dendritic cell (DC) maturation and thus elicit robust T and B cell immune responses. However, innate immune sensing of mRNA has also been associated with the inhibition of antigen expression and may negatively affect the immune response.”</p>
<p>“Potential safety concerns that are likely to be evaluated in future preclinical and clinical studies include local and systemic inflammation, the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen, stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies and potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components.</p>
<p>“A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity.”</p>
<p>“Another potential safety issue could derive from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination. Extracellular naked RNA has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may thus contribute to oedema. Another study showed that extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus [blood clot] formation” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906799/</p>

        <p>Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg (Chair of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Health Committee) &amp; Dr. Michael Yeadon (Virology expert, former Chief Science Advisor for Pfizer): Petition to the European Medicines Agency to stop the vaccine trials</p>
<p>“without the requested stay, the Petitioner and many EU residents/citizens will suffer irreparable harm”
Key Concerns over the vaccine candidates:</p>
<p>The formation of so-called “non-neutralizing antibodies” can lead to an exaggerated</p>
<p>immune reaction, especially when the test person is confronted with the real, “wild” virus after vaccination. This so-called antibody-dependent amplification, ADE, has long been known from experiments with corona vaccines in cats, for example. In the course of these studies cats that initially tolerated the vaccination well died after catching the wild virus.</p>
<p>The vaccinations are expected to produce antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, spike proteins also contain syncytin-homologous proteins, which are essential for the formation of the placenta in mammals such as humans. It must be absolutely ruled out that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could trigger an immune reaction against syncytin-1, as otherwise infertility of indefinite duration could result in vaccinated women.</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer contain polyethylene glycol (PEG). 70% of people develop antibodies against this substance – this means that many people can develop allergic, potentially fatal reactions to the vaccination.</p>
<p>The much too short duration of the study does not allow a realistic estimation of the late effects. As in the narcolepsy cases after the swine flu vaccination, millions of healthy people would be exposed to an unacceptable risk if an emergency approval were to be granted and the possibility of observing the late effects of the vaccination were to follow.</p>

“I understand the importance of accelerating timelines for vaccines in general, but from everything I know, this is not the vaccine to be doing it with . . . There is risk of immune enhancement”https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-insight/as-pressure- for-coronavirus-vaccine-mounts-scientists-debate-risks-of-accelerated-testing- idUSKBN20Y1GZ</p>

<p>“These vaccines better be tested damned well for safety, especially because this vaccine will be used primarily on older sick people and not on young healthy people. So, twelve months is not enough time for that. Not even five years. Certainly not. And that just applies to conventional vaccines.”</p>
<p>“The way this gene-based vaccine works is still unknown scientifically and medically.”</p>
<p>“If you’re foolish enough to inject the gene of the virus, and it goes somewhere else, where it does not belong, it will produce waste there. Then the killer lymphocytes won’t recognize that it is only the gene that was injected and not the virus. It will go there anyway and kill these cells. That’s what we call an autoimmune reaction. How and where these autoimmune reactions will happen, nobody knows. Tests for that have never been done. The pharmaceutical industry never considered that something like that could happen.”https://rairfoundation.com/warning-renowned-virologist-sucharit-bhakdi-warns- against-hastily-created-gene-altering-coronavirus-vaccine-video/</p>
<p>Dr. Romeo F. Quijano, retired professor of pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Philippines, Manila:
“Genetically engineered vaccines carry significant unpredictability and a number of inherent harmful potential hazards, including unintended and unwanted side effects with regard to the targeted or non-targeted individuals. Potential undesirable immunological effects include unexpected immunopathological reaction, autoimmune reaction, long-term tolerance, persistent infection and latent infections. There is also the potential to transfer or recombine genetic material from genetically engineered</p>
<p>viruses or GE virus-vector vaccines to the targeted individual germ line cells. It can also undergo chromosomal integration or insertional mutagenesis, leading to random insertions of vaccine constructs into host cellular genomes, resulting in alterations of gene expression or activation of cellular oncogenes, thus raising the possibility of inducing tumors.”</p>
<p>“Another danger of mRNA vaccines is the use of biotech ‘carrier systems’ involving lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) . . . LNPs could contribute to one or more of the following: immune reactions, infusion reactions, complement reactions, opsonation reactions, antibody reactions or reactions to the PEG from some lipids or PEG otherwise associated with the LNP, as well as adverse reactions within liver pathways or degradation of the mRNA or the LNP, any of which could lead to significant adverse events. Furthermore, PEG can also provoke severe neuropsychiatric symptoms in offsprings, including mood swings, rage, phobias and paranoia. Investigators who once assumed that the polymer was largely ‘inert’ are now questioning its biocompatibility and warning about PEGylated particles’ promotion of tumor growth and adverse immune responses that include ‘probably underdiagnosed’ life-threatening anaphylaxis.”</p>

        <p>There's a book called "deadly medicines and organised crime" by Peter Goetzche which sets out all kinds of horror stories about the practices of big pharma. I wouldn't trust anything manufactured by those companies, or any of their trial results. They are profit driven monsters who give not a hoot about public health.</p>
<p>There's the movie Vaxxed. </p>
<p>There are all kinds of people sounding the alarm about the possible consequences of these vaccines. There are mechanisms by which they could easily cause auto-immune issues, as well as the potential for paradoxical enhanced immune reaction, given what occurred in animal trials for previous MRNA. There's the massive amount of adverse reactions reported, which are guaranteed to be underreported. </p>
<p>But the main thing: you absoluteoly cannot trust anything any big pharma company tells you about the safety or results of these things. It's propagandised to the hilt; they are guaranteed to be far more dangerous than they're letting on.</p>

        <p>I think that the extremely bad side effects are rare, but also that they have cut off your ability to sue Pfizer, Moderna, or J&amp;J if something does go wrong and you also cannot seek compensation from the normal vaccine injury fund. So to me it’s the .05% chance I MIGHT get COVID and die in a small town where only five people have died with COVID period since March 2020, or the chance that I will DEFINITELY be injected with the vaxx and then have no recourse at all if something happens. At this point I’m taking my chances with the rona, if they change it so that if something goes wrong my family can seek compensation then I would be more willing to consider getting the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Im fine with masks and social distancing. Dont necessarily agree with them, but my life can stay relatively the same with them. </p>
<p>The vaccine is experimental and hasn't been out long enough for me and i think the world to know the long term side effects. I have no problem with people getting vaccinated. I personally am in a low risk group, so i will wait longer to get it. I don't see any problem being hesitant about the vaccine</p>

        <p>It's more about it being not needed. When you understand the theory vaccine efficacy is based on is completely false and never  been proven then you must ask why would anyone inject anything like an unnecessary drug into their body? Contagion has never been proven: it only exists is movies and imaginations. So injecting a toxin filled substance into my body for no reason sounds like a bad idea to me. My friend dawn explains this really well in her book https://bookshop.org/books/what-really-makes-you-ill-why-everything-you-thought-you-knew-about-disease-is-wrong/9781673104035</p>
