    <strong>What IS the "anti-vax" agenda exactly? Well, I'm glad you asked!!</strong>
    <p><p>I think it's about high time we hashed out exactly what our nefarious scheme is here guys. There is far too much confusion and "misinformation" surrounding our EVIL movement! Let's just get some things straight here and list all of the things that apply to each and every member that congregates here! The following are absolute FACTS (Snopes said so):</p>
<p>We are ALL Republican Trump supporters.</p>
<p>We are ALL selfish sociopaths suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect.</p>
<p>We are ALL anti-vax: meaning we aren't just against these particular mRNA "vaccines" but every single vaccine in existence.</p>
<p>We are ALL racist homophobes and white supremacists.</p>
<p>We are ALL morons and high school dropouts that slept through Biology 101.</p>
<p>We are ALL going to die from Covid because we didn't get the heckin' jab.</p>
<p>Now that that's cleared up, I'd like to delve a bit deeper into what it is exactly we WANT. Well, it's simple really: INHERITANCE MONEY. See, Covid mainly attacks the elderly and many of us have grandparents... <em>rich</em> grandparents, that is. I'm practically drooling over my keyboard right now thinking about all that sweet, sweet money resting in my Gam-Gam's saving's account. That pension fund though. üëå</p>
<p>With every stroke of the keys, click of the mouse and dastardly twirl of the moustache we spread our misinformation across the internet (mainly Facebook) like deadly Covid spores, cackling as we infect others with our dangerous rhetoric and logic. We have no real desire to return to normal, at least not until this deadliest of pandemics has claimed the lives of every grandparent and we get what is rightfully ours!!! Unfortunately my Gam-Gam is wily and resilient and has yet to perish, but it's only a matter of time!</p>
<p>So that's the anti-vax agenda for you. Hope that helped clear things up: it's not that we've all suffered in some way or another due to the "new normal" (losing small businesses, mental health plummeting, suicidal thoughts, family and friends injured by the vax, a fundamental mistrust of the government, media and Big Pharma due to their history of corruption and lies, fear of increasingly authoritarian and fascist rules and restrictions, childhoods being destroyed, list goes on...), it's that we're all incredibly selfish and misinformed. </p>
<p>Believe that shit if it helps you sleep better at night, you spineless, authoritarian cucks.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Yeah I remember there was a Reddit thread months ago about it and all of a sudden lurkers were coming here and smugly calling us "Dunning-Krugers" lmao, like so obvious they had only just found out about it.</p>

        <p>So sick of that term being used, so over-used now by the general public, it has lost it's original meaning..</p>
<p>and it's relation to "Imposter Syndrome".</p>
<p>In general, people may think they're smarter and more knowledgeable then they truly are, while the opposite suffers from Imposter Syndrome, even though they have a high level of skill.</p>
<p>For those of us who feel like imposters most of the time, or even might at times think we're better than we truly are - both issues can be resolved with good character, honesty, self-assessment, and surrounding ourselves with people in our field who have had success or real skill - who we can truly measure up against.</p>
<p>Sufficed to say, people in 'echo chambers' especially in 'woke' communities that I have had the unfortunate experience of being part of - and suffering the resultant bans and exile from - really believe they are competent and skilled because they don't actually measure themselves against professionals - but each other instead.</p>
<p>They will usually engage in 'you're so good" , 'and you are too!", or to eliminate any constructive criticism coming their way because it is 'toxic', 'discouraging' or 'soul-destroying'... so they never actually improve.</p>

        <p>I just enjoy getting covid and having to stay at home for 2 weeks. It's hard enough to get time off work. just as some people like getting hangovers every weekend, i like having the government telling me i must isolate, and my boss can do fuck all about it.</p>
