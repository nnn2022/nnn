        <p>I think the Rockefeller Foundation basically owns the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>It all started under Bill Clinton. The Clintons are clearly greatly influenced by Winthrop and Nelson Rockefeller. (Some people even speculate that Bill Clinton is Winthrop Rockefeller's son.)</p>
<p>Ever since Bill Clinton's presidency, Democrats have unironically been pushing almost the exact same policies that "Rockefeller Republicans" were pushing circa 1975.</p>

        <p>LINK: <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/the-rockefeller-foundation-commits-13-5-million-in-funding-to-strengthen-public-health-response-efforts/">https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/the-rockefeller-foundation-commits-13-5-million-in-funding-to-strengthen-public-health-response-efforts/</a></p>

<p>&rt;The Rockefeller Foundation is announcing $13.5 million in new funding to strengthen Covid-19 response efforts in the U.S., Africa, India, and Latin America to counter health mis- and disinformation ‚Äì confusing, inaccurate, and harmful information that spreads at an unprecedented speed and scale and threatens the health and wellbeing of communities around the world. The announcement responds immediately to Confronting Health Misinformation: The U.S. Surgeon General‚Äôs Advisory on Building a Healthy Information Environment, which calls for a ‚Äúwhole-of-society‚Äù effort so that people around the world know what to do‚Äîand trust the sources they hear from‚Äîduring a public health emergency.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;‚ÄúBy identifying mis- and disinformation as a challenge to our collective health, the Surgeon General‚Äôs guidance reinforces The Rockefeller Foundation‚Äôs role in investing in data-driven public health interventions to meet the unique challenges of today‚Äôs media environment,‚Äù said Bruce Gellin, Chief of Global Public Health Strategy at The Rockefeller Foundation.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The funding will support the design and evaluation of interventions, tools, and methods to build trust in Covid-19 vaccination efforts and counter inaccurate information, and research to understand how inaccurate health information impacts online and offline behaviors, the true cost of mis- and disinformation on health and economic outcomes, and what strategies might be most effective to counter and manage inaccurate and harmful information from malicious sources. Funded projects will provide a foundation for modern information and communication networks that better serve people and are better prepared to encourage actions and behaviors essential to public health response efforts. Detailed information is slated to be released by the end of 2021.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;‚ÄúScience alone is not sufficient to drive action: the best data analysis in the world will not stop an outbreak if people at risk are not aware of the problem, do not think it is a real threat, do not trust the messenger, or do not know what actions to take to protect themselves and their loves ones,‚Äù said Estelle Willie, Director of Health Policy and Communications at The Rockefeller Foundation. ‚ÄúThe Rockefeller Foundation‚Äôs $13.5 million commitment is a direct acknowledgment that effective public health begins with effective communication that cuts through the noise and confusion stemming from mis- and disinformation.‚Äù<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Today‚Äôs announcement marks another step in The Rockefeller Foundation‚Äôs commitment to reinvigorate public health for the 21st century so that the world can effectively prevent, detect, and respond to health threats to avert future pandemics. This investment builds on the Foundation‚Äôs U.S. Equity-First Vaccination Initiative, which supports community-based organizations serving people of color with the expertise and resources to own and drive evidence-based, misinformation-resilient conversations about vaccines in their communities. Launched in April 2021, the year-long initiative will identify effective strategies to increase vaccine confidence in diverse communities, and assess, to the extent possible, the role misinformation plays in shaping knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about Covid-19 vaccines.</p>

        <p>$13.5 from the Rockefeller Foundation. Wow, this is top cringe. Just if I was to donate 20 cents to a charity and then go on and write a news article about it.</p>

        <p>$13.5 mill? What an insult. This is lip service. I'd be embarrassed to write this press release. For several reasons, really.</p>
