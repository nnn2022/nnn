    <strong>The seemingly mysterious disappearance of Influenza</strong>
    <p><p>NOTE: I’m using technical terms on purpose.</p>
<p>Why is it that Influenza is virtually just as dangerous to the same age demographic as SARS coronavirus, but the Influenza gets virtually like…ZERO…media coverage? Is it just me?</p>
<p>I mean, I can’t remember the last time I saw anything about Influenza in 2019, 2018, etc, unless I was being extremely specific with the search terms.</p>
<p>It’s like…people, shut up about “COVID” and you’ll move on. But no, gotta keep perpetuating this crap. When was the last time anyone truly gave a rat’s ass about if I had Influenza or strep-throat or Pneumonia? No one abandoned friendships or gave damn. I just stayed away for a day or two or stayed at a distance. I never “socially distanced” myself from anyone and no one cared or even thought about it.</p>
<p>Seriously, though. Influenza is like…I dunno. And besides, no one thinks about what “social distancing” events means, like the abstract, metaphysical meaning of it:</p>
<p><strong>Social distancing means to socially isolate yourself from other people. It means to be alone. It means to go against our human nature of being social creatures. It means to undermine our existence and connection to those around us. It means to strip us of our closeness to friends and family. But probably most of all, It means to not be human: humans are social, and social distancing is an agenda. Social distancing is priming the minds of those who accept it to reject and abandon friends or family in response to perpetuated fear.</strong></p></p>

        <p>Yup. One popular thing is to lump all deaths by cases, and then if anyone died with covid “like” symptoms, then they “died because of covid”</p>
<p>It’s seriously messed up being proportion</p>

        <p>Covid spreads because we don’t comply with the social distancing rules but the influenza disappeared because we socially distance?</p>
<p>Makes perfect sense...</p>

        <p>My view is more of the suppossed "covid infections" were just regular colds or flu. After all, it seems isolation and social distancing was not a good idea: </p>

&rt;Dont forget this is about control. Isolated and atomised individuals feeding with fear are easy to manipulate and control .</p>

<p>Some of the info in there is scary. </p>
<p>"Through SARI Watch, a total of 9 ICU/HDU confirmed influenza admissions were reported 
from 131 NHS acute trusts across England from week 40 2020 to week 14 2021. This 
compares to a total of 1671 cases in 2019 to 2020, 3,017 cases in 2018 to 2019 and 3,245
cases in 2017 to 2018 (Figure 15)."</p>
<p>So we've went from 2000-3500 down to 9?</p>

        <p>Perhaps the Flu was initiated and spread by the yearly 'Vaccine' but now lives under a new alias - Covid19.</p>
