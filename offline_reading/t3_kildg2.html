<p>NicolaÂ Sturgeon has been caught flouting Covid rules by speaking to pensioners in a pub without wearing a mask.</p>
<p>The Scottish first minister has had to apologise for her lapse after months of advocating draconian regulations.</p>
<p>The SNP leader, 50, was photographed chatting to three women at a wake last week in Edinburgh. Rules drawn up by her Scottish devolved government state customers in hospitality settings must wear a face covering unless seated at a table."</p>

        <p>I hate this "was being forced to apologize" bullshit. It gives me a childhood flashback to when I was 8 and wandered off during a guided walk. They guilted me into saying I was sorry but I really wasn't. So I usually read these statements as "I'm not sorry but being honest would hurt my career".</p>
