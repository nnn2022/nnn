    <strong>Paramedic’s perspective</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a paramedic who’s worked through the whole Plandemic. I know my experience may be different than other medics out there in different areas, but I never saw the “worst sides” of COVID. However, even if I did see those worst sides, that’s our job. I’m getting real sick of medics around me and especially ICU staff telling “war stories” of what they see to guilt you into wearing a mask and taking the experimental “vaccine.” Of course they’re seeing the worst of it, the job is to literally care for the worst patients. There’s a reason it’s called the INTENSIVE Care Unit. </p>
<p>I’m also fed up with the people saying things like “not wearing a mask is spitting in the face of all the healthcare workers and their hard work to end the pandemic.” If you choose to wear a mask, good for you, pal. If you don’t choose to wear a mask, I couldn’t care less. You’re not disrespecting me by thinking for yourself and choosing not to wear something that doesn’t even work.</p></p>

        <p>"However, even if I did see those worst sides, that’s our job." </p>
<p>Exactly. This is why I never had sympathy for the nurses they wheel out on tv crying about how hospitals are a war zone and how they have to watch people die horrific deaths. As if hospitals were all sunshine, roses, and parties before covid came along. </p>
<p>What do people think happen in hospitals? How is it breaking news that people die in hospitals, some of them unpleasantly?</p>
<p>Dealing with patients dying have been a part of their job before covid and will be long after covid. And some of those patients die awful deaths, it's just that the average joe isn't aware of it because the media is not fear mongering about that 24/7.</p>

        <p>None of the nurses I know are man-haters; they're just attention whores.  I sometimes wonder if people were this obsessed with "social credit" (e.g. likes on Facebook) before social media.  I don't think we were.  I grew up in the 90s and there was no real visible metric system for how popular or virtuous you were.</p>

        <p>It's the same with veterans, police, teachers, etc.</p>
<p>There are always a certain percentage of them who crave attention and validation and use their position in society to demand it from others.</p>
<p>As a veteran, it makes me sick listening to vets who post endless memes like "you're welcome for your freedom".  It's like, shut the fuck up asshole.  Did you volunteer to serve because you want recognition or did you do it because doing the right thing is its own reward?</p>
<p>Same logic applies to paramedics, doctors, nurses, teachers, police, etc.  Quit your bitching and do your damn job, you whiny fucking narcissists.</p>

        <p>That's a pet peeve of mine. My ex is obsessed with his 11 months on a FOB years ago. He worked a computer indoors. When we were together it was FUCK THE MILITARY, I'm refusing to let them raise my rank and give me more responsibility. He got out as soon as his 4 yr contract was up. After we divorced, he started worshipping all of it. He even has a shrine up in his living room. Thankfully he hates the lockdowns and masks.</p>

        <p>I have never experienced something this bad. He worships his veteran status. It is unreal. DL, car tag, car/truck stickers, screensaver, the shrine, so many tshirts and hoodies, just constant advertisement, and he's even in groups for veterans. I'm sure that camaraderie is cool, but I'd feel like a fraud. I'm a veteran myself, but I didn't see or do shit, so I rarely speak of it. I was previously in a serious relationship with someone who was really in the shit (flying into combat zones) and you'd never even know. He didn't even talk about it.</p>
<p>I only know all this because we're raising a kid very amicably and I see a lot of him lol.</p>

        <p>I work in a nursing home. I've seen countless cases of residents in their 80s and 90s being COVID infected, often with already existing health conditions of high severity, and just laughing off the COVID like it was completely meaningless. There is nobody in this entire facility who is scared of COVID. They just want us to stop locking them in their rooms and stop abusing them. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who wears a mask is spitting in my face, because they're spitting in the face of these residents. I love these residents, but I can't help them because of your stupid ass and your hysteria.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  You don’t see nurses on television crying about the real tragedies they have to go through.  You know, like the trauma arrest of some kid mangled in a car wreck that they work and work but can’t save.  How about someone dying in the ER alone before any family can even get to their side; and that nurse is the last one to hold their hand and is responsible for saying something comforting or passing on last wishes to the family.  Yeah.  Now those are tragedies.</p>
<p>These are the real stories that you don’t want to hear anything about, that they don’t want to talk about and that slowly eat away at them exclusively involve trauma.  If you can’t handle someone (many someone’s) slowly passing away on a ventilator I don’t even know how you made it through nursing school.</p>

        <p>Thankyou for speaking out and sharing your perspective as a health professional.</p>
<p>Many other health professionals stay silent and go with the flow because it benefits their careers.</p>

        <p>Exactly. If we were to go only by the worst of the worst, that gets to ICU, we should be terrified of playing sports or driving cars even more. Or smoking &amp; being fat! </p>
<p>Yet in an 'oopsie' I read from NYT, they admit mild case of Covid is just a cold. (In an attempt to sell the vaccine. Yes, 'news' is just ads for shit now)</p>

        <p>I, also a FF/medic in very busy inner-city dept, was just talking about this the other day... We’ve ran more suicides in the last 6mo than I’ve ever had as a whole.. Drug ODs (which we always have plenty of) seem to also be higher than usual.. we got hit very hard by the riots, and we have a lot of murders as well.. yes, we’ve had quite a few covid patients but I have yet to have one truly critical covid patient.  But again, the suicide rate has to be much much higher than usual.
Many in my dept have had SARS-Cov2/covid; I had covid, my whole family got Covid- we all had super mild cases of it.   Perhaps we were just lucky.. or perhaps 95% of cases really happen to be mild.</p>
