        <p>I was able to get the text back from Removeddit:</p>
<p>&rt; This happened today, so i recently remembered that google earth is a thing so i went onto it and started looking around, places like NYC, ireland, swiss alps, mount fuji, london, and then i thought i should have a look at my favorite gorgeous victorian high-street, which has a special place in me, and for that reason i'm not revealing it or its location, so i type into the search bar and it doesn't look like much from the top so i streetview it and after some taps i found the street, then started going down it, i zoomed into the thrift shops, looked at the cars, looked at an antique shop i've been to before, then i come to realize that it just doesn't look at great as it does in real life on a screen, after that, the biggest sense of dread and sadness come over me, this is images from a previous time we'll never get back, i haven't been to that place in over a year, partly due to the lockdown and partly due to other things getting in the way, then it came to me that its all closed, that all shops are closed, that no one is there, and definitly no one using the benches or having a good time, it's all gone now, we've now got a facemask problem in this country, they might become permanent, i might have to talk to my friends who in these shops from behind perspex, then i started contemplating life and if it would be worth living after this, and then i started thinking about how no one really respects me, i have huge self-esteem problems and depression problems at the moment because of it all, my brother mocks me all the time, reddit mocks me all the time, i may never see my street in the same way again, i might be forced to social distance or even worse, forced to wear a mask for the next year or two, nor am i installing apps for mass labelling on my phone, for me, at least, neither are happening, take it or leave it.
&rt; 
&rt; I uninstalled the app and vowed to only revisit that app when i've been on the street again, besides there's limited space on my phone
&rt; 
&rt; TL;DR: Looked at favorite old fashioned street on google streetview, made me comtemplate life over the lockdown and if its worth to continue living, then it got really personal about my self-esteem and depression problems and then i realised i might have to be anti-social against my will to appease the goverment for the next year or two</p>
