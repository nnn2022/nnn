    <strong>How the fuck did it come to all this?</strong>
    <p><p>I just cannot believe how much everything has changed for this past year and a half, and it's depressing as hell. I work in a shop and I remember not having plexi glass behind the till, everyone walking around freely without masks or restrictions not being treated like plague factories. Life wasn't great but it was hell of a lot better back then.</p>
<p>It's fucking insane how fast everything has changed and what the world has come to. There's so much more division now and more idiots who think the science is "settled." 2019 for me, literally feels like 10 years ago. My friend (who did believe in the NWO) committed suicide in early February 2020, just before all this shit went down. I remember him talking about how Covid is gonna be an excuse to push tyranny when it inevitably spreads worldwide and I thought he was talking bollocks. Fauci and the "experts" are looking more foolish than ever, but people still admire them. </p>
<p>I really fear for the future. What is gonna happen? Especially to some of us who chose to not get jabbed? Because I don't think this shit is gonna go away, no matter what people do. Its not a good thing to think about when you're high, but I just can't believe these crazy times we're in right now. Take me back to the 2000's when even YouTube wasn't shit as it is now.</p></p>

        <p>It's all out there, don't need to fact check. Read some old news, Wikipedia, old news articles, old books, and you just need to connect the dots. There's too many coincidences to not believe this is all planned.</p>

        <p>It's going to get worse.  The IPCC report is the start of the next wave of control.  Note the emphasis on methane.  That's a thinly-veiled attack on meat production and consumption.  The new "infrastructure" bill in the USA has a pilot program for mileage-based taxes.  </p>
<p>Travel is still full-on COVID control theater because they want to limit our mobility.  The press for electric vehicles and power when the elites are negotiating for rights to dig in Greenland, which was supposed to be an eco paradise.</p>
<p>What's going to happen?  Boiled frog.  The vast majority of people believe what they see and hear from MSM, social media, and lying politicians.  They will go along with it, until they realize their lifestyle  is rapidly being taken away from them.  When there is beef, pork and chicken rationing but bug/plant protein is super cheap and pushed super hard (remember the whole "Impossible Meat" campaign) maybe some will wake up.  When you can't heat or cool your house to your liking because your thermostat is limited, maybe more will awaken.  When you have to trade in your gasoline powered vehicle to get an approved government model, more will wake up.</p>
<p>But it may be too late by then.  It will take a decade or two before the masses organize.  By then the elites will have amassed all the power and control they need.</p>

        <p>Personally, I believe this winter, the government and "health experts" are gonna use the regular flu to enforce more lockdowns, and not just Covid.</p>
<p>I've seen reports of people being happy about not getting sick with anything since wearing masks. As soon as mask mandates ease completely, the flu and other sicknesses that lurk in the winter are gonna skyrocket (because people haven't been exposed to pathogens for so long due to mask wearing and constant hand sanitising, which is terrible for the immune system and espeically for young kids). I never wear a mask, I used to bite my nails all the time, wash my hands only when absolutely necessary and I haven't been properly sick since 2009 when I had norovirus. My dad is the same and went 30 years without ever getting ill so your immune system needs to learn to fight shit off.</p>
<p>Flu lockdowns are probably a possibility. When they run out of variants to brainwash people, they'll move onto another common illness. I'm calling it.</p>

        <p>You are almost right about the spike protein. The rest is just common conspiracies that have been around forever. Close to the truth but not quite. Here's what happens with the vaccine though. Science backed empirical evidence is going to win our cause. Not concentrating on conspiracies. </p>

        <p>It's normal to feel despair, it could be argued that it's healthy in moderation. When I feel that way I try to ground myself and I take solace in the things I can control. All you can do is your best. Whether it's to organize locally, or even online activism. Go out and find the truth about the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827936/#!po=81.7073">vaccine</a>. Share that information and others like it ad nauseam. Not everyone is a viscous militant pro vaxxer, it just seems that way on Reddit.</p>

        <p>I feel like, making a population live in fear, is the biggest part of the strategy.  It sows division.  There was division in America after 9/11 happened, which we are near the 20th anniversary of.  There was a sense of America standing as one against terrorism.  There was a uniform message from our “leaders”.  </p>
<p>If 9/11 happened again, I would expect media and government use it to fully enslave the public.  That’s a complete reversal of how we were then.</p>

        <p>Because an extremely large percentage of our population are mentally unstable. Look at the things they allow celebrities to teach their children!

I never thought I’d live to witness the complete brainwashing of an entire country. Such that family members, neighbors, co-workers, elected officials, etc. are 100% on board with a complete sellout of each other in the name of media-perpetuated “science”</p>
