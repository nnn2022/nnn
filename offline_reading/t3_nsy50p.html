        <p>Imagine being so upset that you wasted your money on a now dated OLED panel that you would go to the length of issuing bogus bans to avoid having to come to terms with that. You're the definition of a sad loser, and you will <strong>NEVER</strong> experience true HDR on your TV.</p>
<p>I hope you didn't think you were going to get out of this that easily. I win, and you lose.</p>
<p>&rt; "<strong>The mini-LED system is, in my eyes, better than OLED</strong>"</p>
<p>&rt; "Mini-LEDs are way, way brighter than OLED could ever dream of ... with 1400 nits of peak brightness and &rt; 1000 nits sustained; that's about double the best OLED panels can hit right now which is pure insanity"</p>
<p>&rt; "Furthermore, OLED panels can suffer from something called burn-in when sustained static images can quite physically burn into the panel ... on a PC monitor most of what you're going to be using your computer for has static elements on it"</p>

<p>&rt; "<strong>The impact of the 1400 nit brights contrasted with the almost pitch black darks is just something I don't think OLED can capture quite as well</strong>"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRe_z6qVvoI</p>
<p>The fact that anyone is actually recommending an OLED TV for use as a PC monitor to begin with is a testament to how far public education has fallen in this country and you're a prime example.</p>
<p>The cold slap of reality is that contrast is a function of brightness, and that OLED will NEVER be capable of a true HDR experience like Mini-LED technology is, because it is limited by a (very low) brightness ceiling. Mini-LED on the other hand can improve local dimming and reduce black levels simply by increasing the amount of zones. There is a reason that Apple decided to use Mini-LED tech, even in it's present state, as opposed to OLED for Pro Display XDR (XDR is Apple branding for HDR). Your sunk cost/regret over how much you spent on your now dated OLED TV has no place in this discussion, and it is quite literally dragging the quality of Reddit down in that people like you are so desperate to defend their purchases that they will come into future-facing threads on next-gen technology like Mini-LED to just make they still "feel relevant", or worse, break down and abuse mod tools when they hear things they don't like. Like some sort of insecure woman. Let technology be.</p>
<p>You will <strong>NEVER</strong> experience genuine HDR on your OLED as long as you live. Your corpse will rot and your bones will turn to dust before that OLED panel that you paid 1000+ dollars for ever produces a genuine HDR experience. No amount of corruption from you, and no crying will change the this fact.</p>

        <p>What happens is that honest doctors find honest platforms--such as this one r/nonewnormal.  And countless others.  And honest users can spend a few extra seconds to find quality advice and research, and ridicule those who are too lazy to do so.</p>
