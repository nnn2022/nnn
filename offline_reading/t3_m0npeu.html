        <p>I can see if you agree with the narrative that we’re all conspiracy theorists, that this comic would apply to us there.  </p>
<p>But you could also use this comic from the angle of you guys, rather than accepting the fact that “hey, this is a virus; there’s always been viruses around and always will be, a lot of people are going to die, that’s just life, it sucks; but what we can reasonably do is our best to be healthy, keep our immune systems up, get enough sleep, etc., and just accept what comes.”
 But in actuality, your group, being such pussies and so risk-averse, instead of accepting THAT bleak truth, you decided to go “NO NO NO NOT EVEN ONE GRANDMA CAN DIE FROM THIS WE HAVE TO SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN AND LITERALLY EVERYONE HAS TO WEAR A MASK EVERYWHERE NOW UNTIL WE HAVE A RUSHED VACCINE OUT IN A YEAR SO THAT NOBODY HAS TO SUFFER!”  </p>
<p>Who was the crazy one again?</p>
<p>Then there’s the fact that we’re a year into doing all this, you’ve had your way, despite all the science showing how retarded it is (increase in suicide rates is now higher than covid deaths, absolutely destroyed economy, lockdowns/masks proven ineffective), and now people are finally fed up and calling it BS.  And you think they’re somehow crazy conspiracy theorists.  Yeah sorry buddy.  You’re wrong.</p>

        <p>It is a straw man. You’ve conflated a rhetorical device intended to get people to think about how their actions affect others on a micro scale (“even if it saves one life”) with the actual size and scope of a pandemic that’s killed millions of people in a little over a year.</p>

        <p>Well the way I’ve seen it used is that when someone for example says that the lockdown is causing them to lose their job, their relationships, their mental health; the response is “you’re going to value your job and convenience over human life?” And “it’s worth it even if it saves just one life.”  And ironically that in itself is a strawman in a way or at least incorrect; because these lockdowns are not saving lives, but losing more of them to suicide/overdose than we would have lost to covid had we not locked down.  </p>
<p>To clarify A strawman is dishonestly misrepresenting the other side; that’s not what I’m doing.  Or else explain to me where I am Misrepresenting your side on why we need to be locked down.  </p>
<p>Because I’m not sure what your point is.  So far all you’ve really provided in terms of points is “Covid is really bad.”  </p>
<p>So even if we pretend that sure; the pandemic has killed millions of people.  That doesn’t affect my argument.  I’m saying we’ve been locked down for a year and we have clear evidence that the places that have locked down have seen virtually no difference versus those that haven’t, and on top of that the damage from the lockdowns is growing and easily worse than the virus.  (Daily Drug overdoses are far higher than covid deaths; and rising due to the lockdowns.  in many places just the literal INCREASE SINCE LOCKDOWN of overdoses/suicides is higher than covid deaths.). For example Japan saw more suicides in October than they have had deaths in the entirety of Covid.  I’ve noticed the source has since been censored and removed as it detracts from the narrative that is being pushed and favoured by the elites (who also just happen to benefit from these lockdowns).  But Here’s the original link to the source if that counts.  https://abc7news.com/health/in-japan-more-people-died-by-suicide-in-oct-than-from-covid-in-2020/8359064/?fbclid=IwAR31wfoaF9TLzhXhVcYE2Yc2fNS1oNPK6U5hVBWs51mMkjLY_QlNamN2pFg</p>

        <p>For the sake of time, I'm going to ignore the opinions and feelings that make up the vast majority of this post and focus on the only piece of measurable data you felt inclined to include.</p>
<p>&rt;Japan saw more suicides in October than they have had deaths in the entirety of Covid</p>
<p>Because Japan initially handled Covid exceptionally well, their number of Covid deaths in all of 2020 was extremely low when compared to the United States and other western countries. In contrast, about the same number of people died <strong>every single day</strong> in the USA during the same time period.</p>
<p>So, you've chosen one arbitrary month, in a country with significantly fewer Covid deaths than the rest of the world, and you're using that as an example to prove your point. The problem? That example is an extreme outlier.</p>
<p>To add to that, Japan is -- wait for it -- the country with the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_Japan">7th highest suicide rate in the world</a>. In fact, more people killed themselves <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/28/asia/japan-suicide-women-covid-dst-intl-hnk/index.html">in a single month</a> in Japan in 2015 than in October 2020, your example of a Covid-related spike. Was Covid around in 2015? No? Correlation is not causation? </p>
<p>To sum up, you've chosen a country with a <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/japan/">very small amount of 
Covid fatalities</a> and a remarkably high suicide rate -- a total anomaly -- and that was literally the best (and only) example you could come up with to buttress your argument. That's a bad sign. </p>
<p>On top of all that, you couldn't even get the numbers right. You said, "Japan saw more suicides in October than they have had deaths in the entirety of Covid." The article you linked says 2,153 people died of suicide in October 2020. As of today, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/japan/">8,253 people have died of Covid in Japan.</a> For reference, 8,253 &rt; 2,153</p>
