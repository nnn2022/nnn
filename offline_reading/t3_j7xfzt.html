    <strong>This wouldn't be your new normal if you just followed the guidelines and showed some empathy</strong>
    <p><p>The only reason you're in such a mess right now is because you're selfish brats. So many other countries have been able to get their lives back to normal, and have already beaten the virus. Because you're special little snowflakes though, and need to feel exceptional and important, you decided to throw a tantrum and make it worse for everyone else. </p>
<p>You're not rebels, you're not brave, you're not special or intelligent. You're a burden on society and have contributed towards one of the worst economic declines and pandemics the United States has ever faced. Your grandparents were able to stand up and get their hands dirty, when their country needed them. However, because you've been coddled your whole life, you don't understand what true hardship and struggle is. Your life is so unimportant and boring, and your egos so massive, that you create these meaningless dramas to give yourself a purpose. Instead of going into a new year, with everything back to normal, you're going to be dealing with Covid for another year at least. </p>
<p>The world used to look up to America, and it's you people in particular that have ruined that. You should feel embarassed and ashamed. I hope you start to rethink your ways, but we all know conspiracy theorists aren't actually capable of thinking in general.</p></p>

        <p>Showing empathy is suffering with a few inconveniences to guarantee hospital systems aren't overwhelmed and people don't needlessly die. Selfish children don't like to think about others, and want to keep their lives exactly the same. </p>
<p>You might have a case if all the measures suggested, by people infinitely starter then you, weren't shown to work everywhere they're taken seriously.</p>

        <p>There's nothing empathic about police forcing masks on people as in Melbourne. </p>
<p>The second paragraph is the no true Scotsman fallacy. Thanks for showing me you can't actually think, nor spell it seems, correctly.</p>

        <p>Yes it is, the police showed restraint in only forcing a mask on them. They should have been locked up, and heavily fined, for putting the public's safety at risk. </p>
<p>Reading Facebook posts, and watching a few YouTube videos, doesn't make you smarter then all the people trained to deal with this virus. You're larping to make your life more exciting, and putting people's lives at risk while doing so. Countries like New Zealand, and most of South East Asia, were able to get the virus under control quickly, because they care about they're community. You just like to act like an entitled brat. Your tantrum is going to be remembered by society, and you've only guaranteed your place in history as a laughing stock. </p>
<p>Lmao, attacking someone's spelling is what people do when they can't actually refute a point. I thought everyone realised this years ago? Though I shouldn't be surprised you're a behind the times.</p>

        <p>The point was refuted as I showed it to be the no true Scotsman fallacy. Pointing out the error in spelling was additional and not the core point.</p>
<p>New Zealand is still in lockdown and that's not something to be envious of. I spend a bulk of my time in Norway where there are no mask requirements. If you wish to imply the Norwegians suffer from a lack of empathy, or are entitled brats, I suggest you look up the word "dugnad". It's a central aspect of the way they act regarding such matters.</p>
<p>The rest of your, what I'll very generously call thoughts, are just a collection of and hominem statements. Again, another logical fallacy. Still, you are consistent.</p>
<p>And no that's not empathy. I'm very grateful I live in a country free from such acts of violence and my heart goes out to the people of Victoria.</p>
<p>Of you wish to wear a mask then please go right ahead. I won't and that's okay too.</p>

        <p>The point was that if people follow the rules lockdown will end. That's the whole point of the post. New Zealand apparently does follow the rules but lockdown remains. Norway had no masks and more freedom.</p>

<p>Ok, I'm going to say it one last time, as simply as possible. Following the rules helps to eradicate the virus quicker. By keeping the numbers down the lockdowns don't need to be extended, nor do they need to be enhanced.</p>
