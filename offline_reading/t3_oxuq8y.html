    <strong>1937 NY Times article about the Rockefellers buying the medical and education system</strong>
    <p><p>This article changed everything for me and opened my eyes up. </p>
<p>https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/17/specials/rockefeller-gifts.html</p>
<p>The NY Times even tried to conceal it when it happened. Look at how small the article was in the paper </p>
<p>https://www.nytimes.com/1937/05/24/archives/rockefeller-gifts-total-53085632-he-created-great-foundations-to.html</p>
<p>This is the first link of it on Google btw so it's clear Google is aiding in the censoring of this. </p>
<p>Also check out this episode of Corbett Report where he dives even deeper into it. </p>

        <p>What do you think the B&amp;MF, WHO, GAVI, CEPI, etc. are there for?</p>
<p>They are run and controlled by the same financial interests. It's almost unbelievable how much power and control these banksters have. That's why so many people cannot entertain the idea.</p>

        <p>You could say that. They donated to the Red Cross, John's Hopkins, Rochester, Vanderbilt, Washington University, Yale Medical School, created the University of Chicago, set up a $100 mil fund, created a med school in Brazil and put money into Peking, Chinaw med school.</p>
<p>They were going in. And adjust that for inflation. It's actually more like <strong>$17 billion</strong></p>

<p>&rt;Rockefeller's General Education Board, the largest education foundation in the United States in the early 1900's, was the catalyst for the creation of 800 public high schools in the South, where the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission cured half a million cases of hookworm. The education board also revolutionized medicine by <em>demanding that any medical schools receiving Rockefeller money adopt modern scientific teaching methods.</em> </p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil</p>
<p>&rt;Two of these companies were Standard Oil of New Jersey (Jersey Standard or Esso), which eventually became¬†Exxon, and Standard Oil of New York (Socony), which eventually became Mobil; those two companies later merged into ExxonMobil.</p>
<p>&rt;After its dissolution in 1911, the original Standard Oil Co. split into¬†Sohio¬†(now part of¬†BP); ESSO (now¬†Exxon); and SOcal (now¬†Chevron)</p>
<p><em>then we could get into the climate change theories and funding/scholarship bias, but that just confuses me because the Paris Climate Accord literally ignores China which is by far the largest CO2 producer in the world</em> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
