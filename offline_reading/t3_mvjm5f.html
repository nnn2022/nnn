    <strong>KC Currently</strong>
    <p><p>I'm an irregular reddit user and relatively new to this sub. I've been lurking for a little while and love the content. That being said, I thought I'd mention what's going on in my neck of the woods.   </p>
<p>I went out for some business-related errands today. Every office I stopped in, no masks. I wore one in because a lot of the KC-Metro has been finicky about this. I quickly took my mask off at each of my stop. Very refreshing.  </p>
<p>My office has never worn masks, ever. And we haven't closed our office to WFM even one day during this whole thing. I typically hate random salesmen dropping by, but I've seen an increase in these visits over the last week or two. One just asked me how business was going post-pandemic. It caught me off-guard because MSM keeps saying we're in the 'middle of the pandemic'. But I loved to hear this 'post-pandemic' phrase.   </p>
<p>My takeaway from today's outing: Take back your lives. We've given up enough. And if you didn't know, it's already happening out there.</p></p>

        <p>Hey fellow Kansas Citian! </p>
<p>I've never worn a mask the whole time and I've had mixed experiences. 
As of today I've been kicked out of 14 stores after telling them I have an ADA exemption, one store even had hired security.</p>
<p>I've been working with makeamericansfreeagain.com looking into filing a restraining order on the mayor of KC.</p>

        <p>Go you! Stick it to 'em. The further away from the metro center you go the less apprehension you face. I personally am in rural Kansas, but work in JoCo.</p>

        <p>I'm also from KCMO. No one here cares about the virus. I've never once seen anyone in my apartment complex wearing a mask. We have to wear the masks in stores because of Tyrant Lucas forcing them to make us. Occasionally I'll drive out of the metro and it's so nice to be around people that don't even care anymore about maintaining the facade. </p>
<p>The Scheels I go to still has the sign for masks, but more and more people are just blatantly ignoring it. Store employees have zero will to bother enforcing it. It's basically all over by now.</p>
