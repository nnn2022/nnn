    <strong>People are brainwashed</strong>
    <p><p>So I‚Äôm apart of the pregnant subreddit group &amp; there is often posts about mothers complaining that some of their relatives don‚Äôt want to get vaccinated and therefore they can‚Äôt visit their baby once they‚Äôre born. I see these posts at least once a week and everyone that comments agrees, that they need to put their foot down, etc etc. </p>
<p>Like... these are parents and mother/father in laws that they don‚Äôt want to let near their child until they‚Äôre vaxxed. It‚Äôs fcking confusing because how can you and your kid go around in the world without being afraid of anything?! These are the people that are FOR the covid passports, they have to be. </p>
<p>Now here‚Äôs my personal experience with it:
My mom knows I‚Äôm trying right now but doesn‚Äôt actually know I‚Äôm pregnant yet. Today she tells me that when I have a kid, she‚Äôs going to wear a mask around my baby...... WTF ü§¨ </p>
<p>She knows I‚Äôm not getting vaxxed but also what the FUCK does my newborn have to do with that. It‚Äôs the whole ‚Äúsick until proven otherwise‚Äù mentality. It makes me sick. I don‚Äôt know how much more of this toxic world I can take.</p></p>

        <p>Seriously. My kid can play at the park with kids that have like minded parents(finally, again, no thanks to Doug Ford), but not with any other kid at school(if he were to be attending in person school). Not without a stupid mask. I wish I could do more to give him the security that life goes on and we can still live some semblance of a normal life. If we can help it, they won't remember this as anything more than the time they got to be with mom and dad ALL the time. It's the little ones' futures I'm most concerned for.</p>

        <p>I heard covid vaccines could cause miscarriages and countless women report after being vaccinated they‚Äôre having issues with their menstrual cycles. Even women not vaccinated but have been around someone who is, have reported the same thing. Imagine what else it‚Äôs doing and what it would do to a pregnant woman. Personally, if my girlfriend or wife was pregnant I wouldn‚Äôt let anyone vaccinated near them.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm so mixed feelings on this because on the one hand, the vaccine is not safe. It‚Äôs not effective. Newborns aren‚Äôt an at risk demographic anyways. </p>
<p>On the other hand, visiting someone‚Äôs baby is a privledge not a right. I‚Äôm sorry. Grandparents do not have a RIGHT to be around when you‚Äôre in a diaper with blood coming out of you and hormones coursing through your body and I absolutely respect that ultimately it‚Äôs the PARENTS who get to lay down the rules as to who has the PRIVILEGE to be there during the newborn time. </p>
<p>With your mom I would take comfort in the fact that what people SAY they‚Äôre going to do, and what people ACTUALLY do when put in the moment is completely different. We had a friend who swore up and down she was going to require masks around her baby and we were totally okay with that, her prerogative as the mama, but we planned on me and my husband getting to see the baby with a mask but keeping our two year old away because we do not make her wear a mask. As soon as she saw the two year old and the baby together she didn‚Äôt care that a <em>GASP</em> unmasked toddler was all up in her baby‚Äôs grill. We didn‚Äôt make a big deal about it. Address it when it‚Äôs actually an issue. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

        <p>I totally agree with you about people, even grandparents, not being around a newborn in the beginning. I would rather not deal with that for at least the first 4-6 weeks. But with my parents living so close to us, I would at least want them to meet my kid. </p>
<p>The ladies in the pregnant group are sounding like they will NEVER let those unvaccinated in their family be around their baby, even as they grow, which seems utterly ridiculous to me! </p>
<p>Also that‚Äôs been on my mind too! My mom likes to talk a lot but when the time comes, she does something different from what she says. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll want to wear a mask around her grandchild lol</p>

        <p>I have family that has to come through 3 international airports to see me. We personally made the decision that if you do not get up to date on whooping cough vaccine, you cannot come see the newborn because lord knows what you‚Äôre going to come into contact with during travel. My dad staunchly refused to get up to date on whooping cough, so he did not meet my child until she was 6mo and vaccinated for whooping cough. Some people judge for that decision, but honestly the first 6mo I was breastfeeding and it would have been weird to have my dad around when my tits are out 24/7/365 anyways so it worked out. Him and my 2 year old are close so I do understand what it is to be judged for your early parenting decisions in that way. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
