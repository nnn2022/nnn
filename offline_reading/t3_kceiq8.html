    <strong>More CNN hypocrisy:"We would not at all be surprised to see... vaccination happening and then having someone pass away a short time after they receive a vaccine, not because it has anything to do with the vaccination but just because that's the place where people at the end of their lives reside"</strong>
    <p><p>Link: https://archive.is/H1fZG#selection-3073.0-3073.305</p>
<p>"One of the things we want to make sure people understand is that they should not be unnecessarily alarmed if there are reports, once we start vaccinating, of someone or multiple people dying within a day or two of their vaccination who are residents of a long-term care facility. <strong>That would be something we would expect, as a normal occurrence, because people die frequently in nursing homes.</strong>"</p>
<p>Yet when it comes to covid deaths, these same elderly people -  instead of dying - would've been up and about climbing mountains and living for another 10 years which we just happened to steal from them by letting the disease spread, right? </p>
<p>You can't have it both ways. You can't have elderly people being at peak health and invincible when covid takes them yet already on death's door as an excuse if it happens after they are vaccinated.</p>
<p>The VAST majority of deaths from covid have been in long-term care facilities with little time to live and in extremely frail and sick individuals. </p>
<p>The VAST majority of lockdown deaths, suffering, depression, suicides, abuse victims, deaths of despair (drug/alcohol overdose), lack of access to cancer, heart and other disease screenings and treatments, poverty, and starvation will take DECADES off of otherwise healthy and younger people's lives who were never susceptible to covid to begin with (as many aren't).</p>
<p>Long covid is as rare an occurrence as of dying from it unless you are susceptible... and extremely rare anecdotes of the one healthy person it happened to affect among the millions it didn't does not change that. </p>
<p>Yes it was unfortunate that they died...  as was the life of the child who was beaten to death at home because there was no school teacher there to notice the signs and intervene... as was the person who wasn't able to be screened/treated for early cancer who at a later stage of detection will assuredly die from it (because cancer deaths MASSIVELY outweigh deaths from covid on any given year)... as was the family that lost their entire life savings from their business being shuttered and are now living in poverty and had a family member kill themself in despair... do these people not count for anything??</p>
<p>There is no one, NO ONE, without blood on their hands in this mess because there are no solutions, only trade-offs.</p>
<p>To think that being pro-lockdown means that your conscience is clear and you have nothing to feel ashamed about as innumerable deaths from lockdowns occur and you simply choose to ignore them... while you pretend you're a hero for watching netflix, ordering take-out and shaming people on social media who dare to question anything that's happening - well I'm here to tell you, you are equally guilty and worthy of so much shame it's astounding.</p>
<p>Life isn't black or white, it's very much grey and complicated. And just because you decided to put a white hat on your head and claim moral superiority does not make it so. </p>
<p>That thinking is myopic, distorted and dangerous. </p>
<p>This is a highly-contagious airborne viral pandemic and the second that fact was announced, people should have expected that people would sadly die because little can be done about a natural phenomenon. Much like if a hurricane was set to come our way, or a tsunami or an earthquake - there is only so much we as humans can do to mitigate that. But at some point the mitigation efforts have become vastly more deadly than the natural disaster itself. We are drowning ourselves to protect ourselves from the tidal wave.</p>
<p>If people can't even hear us out and allow for thoughts that don't fit in to their simplistic good vs. evil paradigm and call us all a bunch of "disease-spreaders, conspiracy theorists, and alt-right science-deniers" ...while the majority of us are not - we are actually also moderates and liberals, we are scientists, doctors and epidemiologists as well as regular working class, average joe types, friendly neighbors and kind-hearted folks who care deeply enough about our community to subject ourselves to the endless name-calling, social shaming, threats and hatred in order to speak up and defend the people silently suffering while being cast aside as merely collateral damage to a so-called "greater cause" - then there is not much hope for humanity anyways I guess. </p>
<p>But please open your eyes, ears, hearts and minds and prove me wrong about that - prove me wrong that we are no better than a terrified mob of hateful peasants from the dark ages, clutching our torches and pitchforks and demanding witch-burnings and superstitious rituals to appease the angry virus gods. Prove me wrong and hear us out. </p>
<p>Try to see the VAST inconsistencies and hypocrisies from the media and governments for what they they are - the dangerous and destructive over-reaction that is doing much, MUCH more damage than good. </p>
<p>Try to see that there is more to life than living in fear of diseases in a hyper-hygenic world where there is no joy, compassion, community or even humanity - only paranoia, hatred and irrational fear in a faceless, dystopic and cruel reality.  </p>
<p>Look at yourself in the mirror without your mask and try to find the human that was once your reflection.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah they're just trying to save face. The vaccine is going to kill people... I don't know if it's going to have them actually dropping like flies or if it'll just be a large chunk in comparison to other actually safer vaccines but this is also why they want to vaccinate the most frail first.... So they can say "ah, they were gonna die soon anyway see" and then those who are fools and tricked will say "true, how sad, shoot me up, Doc."</p>

        <p>So basically they’re telling us to not be alarmed if people die from the vaccine.  This is there way if covering their asses because the vaccine is gonna be some sort of poison, either for our minds, bodies, or both.</p>

        <p>Awesome piece. </p>
<p>What gets to me the most is the lack of conversation that is allowed. I experience it every single time I talk to my parents. They are so hunkered down over Covid. They believe all of these measures are for the greater good. Then if i bring up arbitrary restrictions, deaths/long term effects from lockdowns, I get shut up. I love my parents to death but its aggravating.</p>

        <p>Good post.</p>
<p>What we are also being told is that the vaccine will create very little difference in how we go about our lives since the lockdowns appeared. Mask wearing must continue, those with cv19 will continue to spread even with the vaccine and those with the vaccine will benefit potentially through reduced symptoms. </p>
<p>And that's it. So there is no end game for this and those who screaming out for continued lockdowns, why? </p>
<p>When the virus has very little chance of killing most people (with the very ill, and on deaths door excepted), yet the continued lockdowns are resulting in other deaths and destruction to livelihoods.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy and inconsistency demonstrated by governments and scientists should be an alarm to most people. But sadly it is not. The fact that 8 months earlier, Whitty in the UK and Fauci in the USA were readily saying this is not such a scary virus and now their narratives are very different should be a real concern. That they cannot be consistent, and that all other views presented  by other real scientist and medical experts is being censored really renders this whole "pandemic" and its "handling" of it a total farce.</p>
<p>Those lockdown/hygiene/etc proponents are acting destructively irrationally and I think many of them once (if) they realise what they have done will be incredibly ashamed of themselves. Ashamed of the damage they caused, the hysteria they contributed to and, painfully, the manipulation they allowed themselves to be subject to by closing their eyes to it. They are being used and abused through their fear and are not seeing things for what they really are.</p>
<p>With respect to long covid, it is becoming increasingly apparent that it only seems to happen to "marathon runners" or "extremely fit" individuals, so I'm guessing the moral of the story is do not be a marathon runner or extremely fit. Unless such a time you get to actually meet and talk to someone who genuinely is and has suffered from "long covid".</p>
<p>The intensity of the media thrust on the scaremongering is just astonishing.</p>
