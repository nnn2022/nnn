    <strong>The psychology behind people who make Covid-19 part of their identity</strong>
    <p><p><strong><em>Note: This isn't meant to attack anyone;</em></strong> <em>It is simply one explanation as to how Covid-19 has become an obsessive part of many people's identities.</em></p>
<p><strong>There is a problem in our society where many people make their jobs/careers the sole focus of their lives.</strong>  The problem with that is -- unless they are the owner, then everything they did or created really isn't "theirs." (We feel this when we leave a job and realize nothing we created goes with us - including most of the relationships we had at the company.)</p>
<p><strong>Without even realizing it, these people don't have much of their "own"</strong> - particularly if they don't at least use some of that money to create a family. <em>(This isn't to attack people without families; I'm pointing out that when you have a family, they too get something out of your work -- and</em> <strong><em>families are relationships that carry with you from one job to the next.</em></strong><em>)</em></p>
<p>So again, these people have only one major focus in their lives -- their job/career. They have no substantial hobbies, and no kids to raise to create a larger sense of purpose for their hard work. <strong>They're typically really good at their jobs but don't have great lives outside of that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Many of these people fall into a weird trap of Covid-19 becoming their sense of identity.</strong> By being on the pro-lockdown side, it gives them a <strong>sense of power</strong> over others and a <strong>sense of purpose</strong>: "saving lives" by shouting down anyone who is skeptical of lockdowns &amp; mask requirements.</p>
<p>Subconsciously these people are actually very unhappy with their lives. The lockdown has them working at home, so they don't even have the work-relationships they had before. If they did have anything else, it's mostly closed. (Movie theaters, restaurants, and even gyms are still closed in my area.) <strong>So they are left with incredible frustration that turns into inner rage, driven by personal unhappiness combined with the perceived threat of Covid-19.</strong></p>
<p>Next we add "<strong>scapegoat propaganda</strong>" which is everything in media that drives these people to blame the spread of Covid-19 on skeptics and people who oppose wearing masks. <strong>This works by channeling all of their frustration (which is really about their own lives) into attacks on others.</strong> This tactic is a well known political manipulation to distract and shift blame onto minority groups, and these people fall right into the trap <em>while we suffer for it.</em></p>
<p>Finally -- add the <strong>systemwide censorship</strong> that is happening across all social media (and especially Reddit.)  <strong>Suddenly these angry, loud, condescending voices appear to be the majority of people.</strong> Thanks to the censorship and banning of any contrary opinion, these people feel further justified that they are right because they don't even see that credible opposition exists. They see only the stereotype that media feeds them: "dumb redneck Karen types" who don't express themselves well --- because <strong>Covid-19 skeptics who express themselves coherently are censored from ever being heard.</strong></p></p>

<p>It doesn't help, either, that we have charismatic people like Gavin Newsom actually <em>encouraging</em> "social pressure" against us.</p>
<p>That was a message to all of these people: "<em>What you are doing is right - keep doing it, and do it more.</em>"</p>

        <p>The people I've observed to be the most doomerish in my life are those who are the most achievement oriented. They think if they do everything right, they will be rewarded. They're actually all very intelligent, but most of them can't conceptualize that not everyone thinks the way they do. They're also all relatively accomplished and stable.</p>

        <p>I feel like what you just said is consistent with what I'm seeing, too.</p>
<p>To my point about not attacking anyone -- some of the perspective actually comes from my own experience, and seeing others in a similar situation.  Art was my greatest love, and I was lucky enough to have a good career for the last 25 years as an artist working in the game industry.  But I realized at one point -- wow. Nothing I create is 'mine' and I actually don't have much say in any of it. That wasn't what I set out to accomplish when I went into art, and now that I'm in my 40s I realize I'd have been better off if I had done my own thing rather than working for studios, you know?</p>
<p>The part about family is -- I just lucked into having a good marriage and kids. And I was lucky to have that when I hit that midlife crisis of realizing I didn't really make the right decisions with my career as a whole. And then I've always had "my own art" and music as a hobby that keeps me going.</p>
<p>But a lot of people don't!</p>
<p>Now that I'm older I've seen many people retire and just die shortly after because after their career ends, they didn't have anything of their 'own.' It's also why I mentioned family, because those people who retire from their careers and don't at least have family to enjoy are the ones that suffer most.</p>
<p>I had a part time putting that in because I knew a lot of people would be offended, because not everyone wants kids and I get that... But -- it's a thing.</p>
<p>I actually think there is a deliberate bias against families in media that comes from a desire to prevent overpopulation. So some would argue that's a good thing, collectively, but even so - it's never good for the individual who reaches the end of their lives and they realize they spent their entire life making others wealthy all to end up alone, with nothing.</p>
<p>That's so dark, but it happens to a lot of people. It easily could have happened to me.</p>
<p>Anyhow, sorry to carry on.</p>

        <p>Great post! I agree there is a deliberate bias against families in media, but disagree on the origin - I don’t believe the anti family propaganda stems from a desire to prevent overpopulation, but rather from the left’s greater, overarching agenda to demonize the nuclear family and traditional gender roles for the sake of homogenizing and destabilizing society as they slow march us toward their socialist / communist hellscape.</p>

        <p>That, and misery loves company. For the do-nothing losers / chronic failures, it feels pretty great to see others knocked down a few pegs despite all their hard work.<br>
Def a “haha” ego boosting /soothing moment for an alarming number of folks with chronically low self esteem / sense of worth who would rather see others fail than try to succeed themselves. Pathetic.</p>

        <p>You’ll notice the virtue signalers in your lives(the social media friends forever on their soapbox in support of the popular movements of the day) all gravitated to being pro lockdown, after all that’s what the celebrities and commercials all told them to do.</p>
<p>The thing is none of these coronavirus Karens actually practice what they preach, they go out, they protest, they had themselves a summer but it would be silly to think the people that do this would ever hold themselves to that standard.</p>

        <p>You're so right.</p>
<p>And not only did they not have lives of their own during this period of time, a lot of them would phone the police on anyone else that continued on with their lives. A culture of reporting on each other... It's like none of these people ever read any of the dystopian sci-fi classics. 1984, Brave New World, It Can't Happen Here, Fahrenheit 451, etc. Those were all required reading in my time.</p>

        <p>I would also add that the MSM, gov't and social media have all worked together to create a sort of "COVID immersion" experience, where there is no escape from thinking about it in our daily lives.  It's not just on the TV; it's in every radio commercial, half the billboards now have people wearing masks, it's in every Amber Alert on the freeway, it's in every store you go into (and also in the fact that there are stores you <em>can't</em> go into).  When I shop for groceries, it's not just the masks and the signs out front, either--they have constant "we're all in this together" propaganda blaring over the loudspeakers.  Almost everywhere you go, you are <em>constantly</em> reminded that the world is not normal and that COVID is something to worry about.  Imagine how terrifying this must be for people who are terrified of the virus!  I am not scared at all of the virus and I still find the constant bombardment of the senses to be stressful.</p>

        <p>Agreed!</p>
<p>Although I should point out --- all people, and not all religions, of course. I'm not religious myself, but I know some decent people who are.</p>
<p>To your point though, there are people who have taken a sort of "religious" view of science which actually isn't scientific at all... And they're quick to attack people with the same kind of dogma as the religions you're referring to!!!</p>

        <p>Precisely so. Its obviosu that the religious zeal of past epochs was merely subsumed into the current religion of science. Science holds the same hierarchichal structure as the church, the same emphasis on rank of social status, the same capitulation to authorities. Every aspect of dogmatic religious culture has survived into the so-called scientific era. It's beyond ironic that these people are so angry with religion when they essentially share the religious worldview. Just deities with a different name.</p>

        <p>Knowledge of astronomy was fundamental to many religious societies. Gregor mendel was a friar and abbot (even though i dont like him). The roman church preserved classical science and, at first resisted, but later propagated, advances in arab science and medicine.</p>

        <p>Thanks for reading my lengthy take on it.  There were some aspects that were hard to write because I didn't want to offend anyone, but hopefully the meaning comes across.</p>
<p>There are actually a LOT of simularities to this period of time and the time around 2001 when the emotions around 9/11 were channeled into a second Iraq war (Iraq had nothing to do with 9.11)  --- a war over "Weapons of Mass Destruction" which didn't exist. Remember that?  </p>
<p>Remember the yellow, orange, and red daily terror alerts? (Which incidentally Tom Ridge later admitted to having been politically motivated (!) as opposed to be based on actual threats.)</p>
<p>Remember being called "unAmerican" if you were skeptical?</p>
<p>It's all very similar to then.  A lot of Redditors are too young to remember this stuff.</p>

<p>This sounds a lot like what I see in Sooners of any stripe.  They problem they have is they have no identity of their own, they’ve never been tested on anything never had their real selves held up to them.  Covid gives them the opportunity to have a grand narrative it’s the first test they’ve had.  They have no idea how they look, or what they can or cannot do, they’re creatures with no real sense of themselves.</p>

        <p>I think a factor that isn't talked about as much as it should be is the media's obsession with both terrorism and mass shootings in the past twenty years.  You have tragic but outlying events being portrayed in a way that exaggerates how common they are, with active shooter training in schools and workplaces priming people's fear.  I had already noticed friends becoming increasingly anxious about certain public activities.  I wonder how much a fear of being in public has been building in the last two decades under the surface until this virus became a psychological trigger point.  It matches with the #stayhomestaysafe propaganda at the beginning of this in mid-March.  I also wonder if that's why teacher's unions have been particularly resistant to going back, because of this accumulated anxiety over years that has been especially potent in a school setting.</p>

        <p>Those are incredible points... It's like there are layers upon layers of fear put upon us by the media consume.</p>
<p>The fascinating thing is -- aside from the mandatory lockdowns, most of the fear would go away if we would all just tune out...</p>
<p>They make it hard, though. At one point I avoided the internet completely to get away from the Covid doom -- and Microsoft started putting it in my Start Menu and Google started sending me alerts about it...</p>

It was something like a bad flu, with numbers that looked worse <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/08/dr_birx_unlike_some_countries_if_someone_dies_with_covid-19_we_are_counting_that_as_a_covid-19_death.html">because Covid-19 deaths are counted differently</a> from how flu deaths are counted.</li>
<li>Flu numbers were light the year before, so arguably there were more people alive in 2020 that would be susceptible to something like flu or Covid. Couple that with exaggerated death counts and of course the number went high.</li>
<li>Doctors were also <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">advised to assume positive</a> when it comes to labeling deaths as Covid-19 related. This was at a time when there were increased payouts for Covid patients and hospitals were hurting for money because non-essential services were cut down. In other words - government said, "Please assume positive, and here's some extra money for you if you do."</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html">huge percentage of Covid-19 deaths</a> were caused by a handful of governors forcing nursing homes to accept Covid-19 patients. Considering a complete imbecile would know that's a bad idea -- anyone smart enough to rise to the top of state power must have made that decision for some other reason. Isn't it curious that they were never held accountable?</li>
<li>Even the exaggerated number that is reported is 202k deaths. It sounds like a big number but remember that around 2,740k deaths happen every year just normally. About 1.1 million of those are heart attack and cancer deaths, but we don't do something crazy like shut down fast food restaurants to prevent those deaths. So why the exaggerated response to these deaths? Also, that's 1.1 million people a year... So 11 million people over the last decade. Wow. If 202k is enough to shut down the economy and make sweeping changes to our social structure, you'd think 1.1 million is enough to shut down fast food, alcohol, Big Tobacco, and other peddlers of death, right?</li>
<li>And since the death count we're talking about is tracked by Johns Hopkins, maybe we should mention that <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/study_suggests_medical_errors_now_third_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us">Johns Hopkins reported that over 250k people in the US die every year from "medical errors."</a> If 202k deaths is enough to shut down society and run up 5 trillion in debt --- you'd think 250k medical error deaths would at least have people scared to go to the hospital, right?  </li>

<p>Nothing makes any sense... I could go on and on...</p>
