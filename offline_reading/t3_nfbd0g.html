        <p>So, antibodies are produced by B-Cells, but are only part of our immune system.</p>
<p>The focus on antibodies is a red herring. Most people don't have persistent antibodies (we don't need them), so the fact that they have been found is not really of much consequence, since we know the vast majority of people don't have such persistent antibodies.</p>
<p>If you look at "Figure.  Adaptive Immunity to Coronavirus Disease 2019", the first image when scrolling down here:</p>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770758">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770758</a></p>
<p>we see the "symptom onset" is where we start to have B-cells and antibodies come into play. Prior to that we are requiring T-cells reactivity to prevent the infection from progressing to symptoms.</p>
<p>In other words, even reaching the antibody stage of our immune response in a reinfection or in a vaccine should be considered a fail, a fail of the T-cell reactivity.</p>
<p>We have a few kinds of T-cell reactivity:</p>
<p>- virus enters body, T-cells are like, hey you look suspicious as fuck. What you multiplied? Let me see if I can kill you? I can, and the T-cells destroy the infection. Infection done, never develops into a case. This is innate immunity since the T-cell could readily recognize and had pre-existing tools to kill the virus.</p>
<p>- virus enters body, T-cells are caught unaware. virus begins to multiple, T-cells don't recognize the virus, but they see it is acting virus like and they try different tools in their arsenal to kill it. They find a tool and then all use that one and kill the virus. This would be an asymptomatic infection: T-cells did not readily recognize the virus, but were able to see the behaviour as odd and find a way to kill it. Or they don't find a way to kill it and it becomes symptomatic and we need B-cells to get involved.</p>
<p>What we hope for is a reactivity or cross-reactivity of T-cells sufficient enough to act as innate immunity. We are trying to add a new line of code to the T-cells that let them see and attack this virus as soon as it enters our body.</p>
<p>Why this research doesn't matter, is because we can already see the extreme rarity of reinfections with covid by either the same strain or mutated ones. With estimate of over 100m infections in the US, we have only seen a handful of reinfections. In Manaus, they've had hundreds of thousands of infections by 2 separate strains, but only 3 recorded reinfections (as of last month). This suggests the T-cells are working and have at least quite strong cross-reactivity.</p>

<p>Indeed, in saner times, this was already known, for influenza.</p>

<p>"Naturally occurring cross-protective T-cell immunity protects against symptomatic PCR-confirmed disease in those with evidence of infection and helps to explain why many infections do not cause symptoms."</p>

        <p>Another relevant excerpt from the article /u/CitationDependent linked to.</p>
<p>&rt; Based on models of immunity and reinfection dynamics of the common cold coronaviruses, human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43, HCoV 229E, and HCoV HKU1, limited protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested. In a study involving a human challenge to a circulating coronavirus (HCoV 229E), IgG and IgA antibodies waned over the first year after viral nasal challenge suggesting that protection against repeated infections with common cold coronaviruses lasts only 1 or 2 years.9 However, following experimental rechallenge with the same HCoV 229E strain at 1 year, no individuals who had been previously infected developed a cold and all had a shorter duration of detectable virus shedding. Thus, at least strain-specific immunity to clinical coronavirus disease may be preserved despite rapid waning of antibodies.</p>

        <p>B cells are much more important for immunity than T cells. You know that 5% chance you can still test positive but not have symptoms with that vaccines? That's your antibodies failing but your T cells still recognizing the virus and preventing it from getting out of control</p>

        <p>Going to go with the link I provided which shows T-cells are the first line of defence with covid. B-cells, and by extension, antibodies come in later. You discuss the 5% chance of T-cells sweeping up a covid case, but ignore the fact antibodies were only found in <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8942889/T-cell-test-EIGHT-TIMES-better-detecting-infected-coronavirus.html">54 of 113 cases</a> which showed T-cell reactivity. </p>
<p>Acting as if this represents 5% is highly disingenuous.</p>

\&rt; “T cells precede the antibody response because you need T cells to generate antibodies. There’s a potential indication for use there, in acute testing,” Mr Wrighton-Smith says. </p>
<p>&rt;https://news.ki.se/immunity-to-covid-19-is-probably-higher-than-tests-have-shown<br>
August 18, 2020<br>
“Moreover, roughly 30 per cent of the blood donors who’d given blood in May 2020 had COVID-19-specific T cells, a figure that’s much higher than previous antibody tests have shown.”<br>
"Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in.”<br>
"Patients with severe COVID-19 often developed a strong T-cell response and an antibody response; in those with milder symptoms it was not always possible to detect an antibody response, but despite this many still showed a marked T-cell response.”</p>
