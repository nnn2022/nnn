    <strong>The glorious study about the truth on asymptomatic spread!</strong>
    <p><p>I am amazed at this study below compared to media lies as far as the extent of COVID asymptomatic spread. I also remembered how during the height of COVID last year when I believed everything the media said that I also stopped taking symptoms and feeling sick seriously since I figured “the virus will
spread regardless”.</p>
<p>I wonder if this myth lead to more people going out when they were feeling legitimately sick since they didn’t think it mattered anyway since they could spread just as well without symptoms? And maybe in the same way that mask efficacy lies can be speculated to make things worse via their effect on behavior... so may have this lie made things worse!</p>

<p>“Household secondary attack rates were increased from symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) than from asymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%)”</p>

        <p>You're spot on. In the Philippines the first step was to encourage social distancing. People were afraid and barely anybody was outside even though there wasn't a lockdown. If anybody even coughed slightly, people backed away in fear or started accusing the cougher of having COVID-19 and spreading the virus. </p>
<p>Shortly after a mask mandate was put in place. Suddenly the streets were packed again and everybody ignored social distancing. When people coughed at closer proximity to somebody, nobody reacted as they were convinced that their masks were saving them.</p>
<p>From what I have observed, virtually everybody here still believes that COVID-19 is an extremely deadly virus. I have met one other person here in the last year who knew that we were being lied to. He was also white...</p>
