        <p>I was going to bed but looks like I need to brew some tea for this honker! (Dodgy parts in bold.)</p>
<p>&rt;and <strong><em>sample date of positive specimens</em></strong></p>
<p>Positive from a previous PCR test? At what CT?</p>
<p>&rt;Such a result is referred to as S gene negative, or S gene target failure, and <strong><em>has a strong association to infection with the B.1.1.7 variant in the UK</em></strong>. S gene negative results have subsequently been used as a proxy to track the progression of this variant in the UK.<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-2"><strong>2</strong></a><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-7"><strong>7</strong></a><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-8"><strong>8</strong></a><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-9"><strong>9</strong></a> <strong><em>This association is not necessarily as strong in other countries as variants there can also produce S gene negative results.</em></strong></p>
<p>They are already telling you that there's no UNIQUE way to determine with certainty that this new MuH vArIaNt is in fact responsible for these infections.</p>
<p>&rt;Sequencing of VOC-202012/1 revealed 14 genetic mutations, eight of which occurred in parts of the genome that code for the spike protein responsible for cell binding,<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-10"><strong>10</strong></a> and which impairs detection of the S gene. These mutations seem to have imparted a phenotypic change to the cell binding mechanism,<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-2"><strong>2</strong></a><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-7"><strong>7</strong></a><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-8"><strong>8</strong></a><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-9"><strong>9</strong></a><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-11"><strong>11</strong></a> with the potential for increased infectivity.<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-12"><strong>12</strong></a><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579#ref-13"><strong>13</strong></a> <strong><em>The impact of the change on clinical presentation, patient outcome, and mortality remains poorly understood.</em></strong></p>
<p>What they are basically telling you is that they are going to use Virology 101, zero epidemiology and voodoo econometrics to make the result sound as terrifying as possible. I can already predict that the conclusion will be alarmist and scream for more measures and hospital capacity.</p>
<p>&rt;We used linked data from <strong><em>syndromic community testing and death records</em></strong> to assess whether the new SARS-CoV-2 variant is associated with a different risk of mortality compared with previously circulating variants.</p>
<p>In the previous section, they just said "<strong><em>The impact of the change on clinical presentation, patient outcome, and mortality remains poorly understood"</em></strong> but are now going to go ahead anyway by using syndromic community testing and death records. Were all infections and deaths from Oct 2020 being tested for the mUh VaRiAnT?</p>
<p><strong>The BIGGEST problem in this retrospective cohort study is that it used records that were not designed for the study and the available data is of poor quality.</strong></p>
<p>I've lost my desire to continue reading this because of the aforementioned issues. I'd be pleased to continue tomorrow but I don't think that there'll be a need because whoever threw this at you won't be able to answer my questions.</p>

        <p>Okay, thank you for this. I posted it since I wanted it actually critiqued rather than just swallowed. The person who threw this at me was <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-variant-uk-higher-death-rate-study-1.5943617">CBC News</a> via my professor. üòÇ</p>

        <p>I read that doom-porn of an agitprop article and it's revolting. Fortunately, a cursory look at the comment section reveals that many people are aware of the deliberate misinformation. FWIW, I didn't know about the other two variants as it looks like the fear-porn is accelerating faster than even I can read about it. </p>
<p>BTW, in the original BMJ article," From these, 214‚Äâ082 people were identified who matched with at least one other individual on age, date of specimen collection, sex, ethnicity, geographical location, and index of multiple deprivation, and differing only by S gene status," IGNORED the most important things that determine mortality: healthy and the existence of co-morbidities. Without control for these, the study is just pseudoscience and is to be relegated to the dustbin of econometric chicanery.</p>

<p>If used by fear mongers, i suspect this detail will not be mentioned.</p>

        <p>That's something I noticed to. I know this is getting downvoted but I was actually looking for people who'd actually be willing to critique it.</p>
<p>I also posted it over to r/science to see if they could grade it but I doubt they'd be a critical.</p>
