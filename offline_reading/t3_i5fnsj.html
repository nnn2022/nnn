<p>But none of this was planned in advance. We're just plumb getting the "New Normal" thrust on us right now!</p>

        <p>Yes, it's almost like there's a preconceived technocratic agenda and the general public are have been trained to substitute actual critical thinking with deferring to "authorities" for the "facts" so that they never see what's going on.</p>

        <p>I just get frustrated and tired of people acting like all of this is just a result of stupidity and well intentioned mistakes. How can people, especially in this sub, believe this isn't a targeted effort in changing society at his point?</p>

        <p>It's very psychologically disturbing for a lot of people to consider that it's all been deliberate. It's too horrifying. </p>
<p>I think most people here know there's an agenda, though they may differ on how far that agenda goes.</p>

        <p>They won't accept it. People hate being told that they've been fooled so much that they'll carry on with the old narrative just to avoid, through herd mentality, the realisation that something's not right.</p>
<p>That's why it's important to simply say that this particular government is simply incompetent. If it's incompetence, then they can just do what they've always done (which is doing nothing .ie. voting), and get a new government in. If it's systemic evil, then that may require them to actually do something.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is a conscious thought process on their part. It's just my assessment.</p>

        <p>This.</p>
<p>I know a fair number of people who will roll their eyes and state in a mild-mannered way that "this is all so stupid." But they don't understand why I am so angry and they don't want to go to any kind of a darker place about this because it is too scary for them.</p>

        <p>I think this is the case with my mother-in-law. She doesn't really believe the drivel on CBS or Facebook, she knows deep down that something is very wrong with the whole system beyond just Trump or Biden, but it scares her and pains her too much to think about it because she's a helpless little old lady on 20 different meds. My mom is marginally more conscious of the situation, but she still tells herself everything will all go back to "normal" soon enough. Like how everything went back to "normal" after 9/11.</p>

        <p>Yep, and let's not forget <a href="https://id2020.org/">ID2020</a>, which is founded by <a href="https://www.gavi.org/our-alliance/about">GAVI</a> (Bill Gates) and <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/">The Rockefeller Foundation</a>. It says right on the ID2020 page that they've been working on it since 2016.</p>
<p>And there's <a href="https://covipass.com/faq/">COVI-PASS</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Who are the companies involved in COVI-PASS™? How do I know that I can trust them?</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"The COVI-PASS™ health wallet is owned by you, this means you are in control of your data at all times and you grant access when required. We are currently working with Governments around the world, along with private businesses to assist with safe, reliable and accurate testing that supports our health wallet. If you want more information, please contact us to book time with one of our team."</p>
<p>Nice way to not answer the question at all.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>What if I decide not to have a COVI-PASS™?</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Having a COVID-19 test might <strong>be required</strong> if you are in a certain profession such as social care or retail for example. It might also <strong>be required at certain touch points in life, such as going on holiday</strong>. If you do require a test, you’ll need a way to show the result. COVI-PASS™ is one way to do this. The result can also be shown on paper, although it’s probably safer to store it digitally.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tons of articles and videos of prominent figures talking about this for a long time, but yeah, "it's just a conspiracy theory".</p>
