    <p><p>Like I (and anyone else who was skeptical about the patriot act) was asked "If you've got nothing to hide, what is there to worry about?" Gotta love it when the authoritarian state can't handle their own bullshit being thrown back in their faces.</p></p>

        <p>It's actually the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 which grants pharmaceutical companies complete immunity over vaccine injury and death, which is convenient since they are not held to the gold standard of medicine that pharmaceuticals are typically because vaccines are conveniently labeled as "biologics." At that time vaccine manufacturers were being sued into oblivion, particularly from ill effects of the dtap (dipheria tetanus and pertussis vaccine) but all of their vaccines were leading to a plethora of injuries and deaths which they always have, because as the Supreme Court determined at that time they are "unavoidably unsafe." The solution was to create a vaccine court because otherwise the dangers of vaccines and the consequential lawsuits were going to put the entire vaccine industry out of business, and this is what they had to admit in order to appeal to the government for complete un-American legal immunity. The vaccine court is a one sided court in which you must be represented by an attorney who they pick and typical legal proceedings that help ensure justice such as discovery are omitted from the court processes. It is exceedingly difficult to qualify to have trial in the court, you must go through a tangle of processes unknown to the American court system, jump through various hoops and hope you are accepted, and file your claim within 3 years of the injury or death. A table of designated injuries or causes of death is preexisting and many known vaccine injuries will not be included or heard in the court. A tax placed on each vaccine pays out to those who are somehow despite the rigged nature of the court, able to prove vaccine causation. You can only be awarded a max of 250k I believe, since 1986, even if the lifelong medical costs go into the millions which they often do or if death resulted. Like the patriot act, the vaccine childhood injury act has a name that makes it sound like it's standing up for humanity, when actually it is designed to benefit corporate interests exclusively.</p>
