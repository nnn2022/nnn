    <strong>Why are vaccine reactions brushed off?</strong>
    <p><p>I honestly am sick to death with people dismissing people’s vaccine reactions because ‘ Well I got it and my sisters friends dogs nieces aunts cousin got it and is fine! ‘ ... but in the same breath they will eat up any mild symptom of covid and think it’s the worst thing in the entire universe as we are all doomed. The majority of people don’t have symptoms, some are mild, some more severe and in comparison to the world are very few that are critically ill and die. If the vaccine reactions were told are actually because of covid, they’d believe you. But because there may be a link to the vaccine I’m a conspiracy theorist? </p>
<p>Most people who die from/of/with covid die at home not in hospital. That should only prove how not deadly it is in comparison with the PR team the virus has. I am still waiting for hospitals to be overrun and people dying in hallways a year and a half later.</p></p>

        <p>yes they have. they can’t think critically anymore. if they get the vaccine and trust it, why still wear a mask? to protect me i guess.  outside? in your car alone? if i don’t wear a mask why are they mad? if their mask works they shouldn’t care what i do. walk around me. ITS ALL UPSIDE DOWN</p>

        <p>Imagine all the poor grieving family and friends who watched as their loved ones deteriorated after the vaccine and then recieve death threats for speaking out.</p>
<p>My dog had a severe reaction to medication that none of the 5 vets at his hospital ever seen before. Some had been there 36 years. I took him to a neurologist who told me he was "fine." The vets told me there was "nothing wrong with him." But I raised my dog from a puppy and can unequivocally attest that he is 100% different after the medication. There is definite nerve damage as his ears always tremor and his eyes twitch. Imagine all of the people trying to convince me that I'm crazy imagining things and don't know what I'm talking about when I have spent every single day of mine and his life together for 8 years. Since I don't have "medical background" my experience is anecdotal at best and I have "no proof" it was caused by the medication. Even though the medication warning label says "may cause tremors and seizures resulting in death," his reaction was "coincidental."</p>
<p>Parents losing children and people screaming "you deserved it!" for speaking MiSiNfOrMaTiOn?! Imagine being told your personal experience is misinformation.</p>

        <p>He is. Thanks for asking. The drug was metronidazole for your own future reference (apparently the reaction is SO RARE that the vets don't feel the need to warn of the side effects... I actually had to find out online.. they paid for his aftercare which required valium, diazapam, and 3 separate days of fluids) and apart from the spasms, his personality is back to normal and he's learned how to live with it. But NO vet can tell me that he's "fine" after all that because he never had balance and twitching issues and now he does. Poor thing is always rubbing his eyes... It's easy to say there is no proof. And too many of these people are seeing things with their own eyes and being called crazy for it.</p>

        <p>Because it’s very easy to sensationalize it (something the media is very good at) and make people hesitant/reluctant to get the vaccine. Sadly, we now live in an age where vaccine hesitancy is the same as being anti-vax.</p>

        <p>A friend of mine used to say: don't go to bed, that's where people die.</p>
<p>The government sold vaccines as the ticket "back to normal", or whatever "normal" is even left, while it was (politically) hard to impossible to admit that the reaction in March/April 2020 was overkill (even though it might have been the correct response given the information at that time). Voters punish such mistakes gravely. So politicians are caught in the hysteria they themselves created and the real-world adverse effects of the solution, they proclaimed as the exit. People are destined to eat that up and they are used to side effects of vaccines, especially if they are used to getting a flu shot every year and feel sick for two or three days after getting it.</p>
