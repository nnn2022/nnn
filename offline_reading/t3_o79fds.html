        <p>Here is the paper about the nursing home this guy is talking about.</p>

<p>The review reported on 19 May and concluded that a causal link between the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and death was considered “likely” in 10 of the 100 cases, “possible” in 26 cases, and “unlikely” in 59 cases. </p>
<p>So Pfizer is  at least a possible contributor in 41% of the deaths? WTF?</p>
<p>These COVID vaccines seem like deliberately malevolent medicine. I don't  see how the vaccines could be that bad purely by negligence.</p>

        <p>I've always wondered how many people would get a COVID vaccine if they realized that the pharma companies themselves literally say the vaccines were made by one scientist in a day or two. And that the pharma companies also say the genome to the virus was provided to them, seemingly free of charge,  by the CCP.</p>

        <p>If COVID is a deliberate Chinese bioweapon, is it deliberately designed so that any vaccine against it is extremely dangerous?  </p>
<p>I can't help but wonder if Sinopharm and Sinovac are anything more than saline spray. I think that China might realize it's better to not vaccinate anybody against COVID-19.</p>
<p>And why the hell would China voluntarily give up the virus genome to the 4 Western vaccine companies, but not actually use those vaccines themselves? It's almost like China wanted the entire world except for China to have those vaccines.</p>
