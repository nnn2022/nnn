    <strong>I don't know if I wanna keep living like this.</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Sweden, I'm 18, we just went back to virtual school. I can't focus during "class", I'm not learning anything and everything fun about school (i.e spending time with my friends) has been taken from me. They say it's only til around the end of January, but I bet they're going to extend it cause guesss what, people are still dying.</p>
<p>With the new pandemic law essentially looming over us, I see no point in anything anymore. I can't do anything. I can't look forward to anything. I know it's not technically illegal for me to see my friends, but we've got so many tests and assignments to do so there's no time for that, not to mention the now ever so present stigma around it.</p>
<p>The ONE thing I had to look forward to was traffic school, getting my driver's license, driving lessons. It's the one thing I had outside of school. But now they've extended our days with another subject so there are no reasonable times available for me to go driving either (no times on the weekend and I can't drive at 7:20 in the morning). They took that from me too.</p>
<p>So what's the point? Why should I even keep going? Nothing makes me happy. I get a rush of momentary bliss when I watch some old footage of a forgotten 90's icon go on about how we gotta save the earth, but that's about it. I hate having to rely on some now 50 year old when they were still young and cute as a barely stable coping mechanism.</p>
<p>It wouldn't even matter if I just up and killed myself right now. They wouldn't care. If it's not COVID, it doesn't count. </p>
<p>The only thing keeping me from going through with it is knowing that I'd either be used for their pro-lockdown propaganda, or they'd rule me as a "COVID death" cause I've been sniffling a bit. Throw in that I was too much of a trypanophobic to take the vaccine (not to mention the side effects scare me) and I could be the poster child for people calling everyone who won't take the vaccine an "anti-vaxxer" even though I've taken every single vaccine I've had to take.</p>
<p>I don't know where else to turn. I don't wanna be shoved with propaganda. I just want to be seen.</p></p>

        <p>If you're ever actually serious about killing yourself, then the important thing to realize is that you don't have anything left to lose. You're willing to give up your most prized posession (your life), thus you can do whatever you like. What's the worst that can happen? You die? You were going to do that anyway. Might as well experience true freedom before you go, or do whatever else you feel like.</p>

<p>The question is, what do <em>you</em> deserve? </p>

        <p>first, while it's over the internet and not necessarily ideal, we see you here. you are important to our movement, and you making it through this period with us matters. </p>
<p>I can't imagine being 18 years old and going through this, but you can, and what will be important is that you can serve as a voice in the future to prevent something like this from happening again. </p>
<p>as a note of hope, even the Cuomo types are starting to push for reopening. the phrase "it's always darkest before dawn" is perhaps a cliche, but from all of the harder life experiences that I've personally had, it's been pretty accurate. the tide is turning. people will be looking for a group of people that can absorb them, as they transition from pro-lockdown to anti-lockdown. just this morning, I drove past the bluest town in the bluest state, and I saw 3 people standing on the sidewalk talking. two people had no masks anywhere near their face, and one person was wearing the mask. a month ago, I was unable to find a single person not wearing a mask in the entire town, even walking outside alone. so things are changing and getting better. </p>
<p>lastly, while I'm not in your position so I can't personally feel what you're feeling, I think that I have felt similarly before. the thing that got me through is realizing that waking up in the morning and surviving the day is oftentimes the bravest thing that a human can do. if that is the only thing you get done in a day, even if you feel like you messed up or like you didn't accomplish absolutely anything productive-- and even if those feelings actually are accurate-- you lived to see another day and in that choice, you reaffirm that humanity can and will make it through the darkest times. </p>
<p>you can do this.</p>

        <p>What has helped me significantly is I stopped wearing a mask outdoors in public spaces and I've begun reaching out to friends to hang out. MOST of them are not willing to, but SOME actually are and have been happy and thankful that <em>I</em> "broke the ice" and reached out because they didn't want to be seen "doing the wrong thing" but were thankful I took the lead.</p>

        <p>It's funny how liberals make it out that Swedes and other liberal Europeans hate us Americans for being more freedom-oriented when it reality your post proves how much were alike. We experience the same hardship, and we can relate to a lot of stuff despite being from different countries. Nice to see freedom-loving swedes. My false perception is probably a result of the media, lying, and pitting countries against each other. We can demand freedom together.</p>

        <p>THANK YOU for speaking up! I'm so so sorry you feel this way! </p>
<p>Just for the record: All your feelings are valid. </p>
<p>When I go through shitty moments and I think as if I am not able to push through anymore... I make myself to remember: this too shall pass. </p>
<p>I know it might not sound helpful at the worse moments - but talking from experience it did help me.</p>
<p>I'm much older than you - actually my son is your age, and I need to tell you: there are moments in life that are worth to go through this shit!! </p>
<p>I wish there was something I could do for you, for each and every young adult... Can't imagine how difficult it must be for you guys... </p>
<p>Thanks again for speaking up - you are brave! </p>
<p>If worse come to worse - I do agree with someone on here saying - pack and go! Sounds crazy? Good! But it's doable. My mates just moved to Peru! It took them 10 days to travel there from Spain and they had super tight budget but they made it. </p>
<p>Do not stop your life - there is too many beautiful places to see, too many beautiful people to meet! </p>
<p>Feel free to message me at any time! </p>
<p>Take care x stay safe!</p>
