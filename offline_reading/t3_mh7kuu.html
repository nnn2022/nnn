<title>"It's no different than a year ago"? Bullshit! Cases AND Deaths have gone way down. We spent a year masking up and distancing. The most of us I'm sure did the mandatory 2 week isolation that was originally asked of us in 2020. How can these people say things are no different than a year ago?!</title>

        <p>Same fam.  Every single social media post was about how virtuous everyone was being and "I'm staying home for the common good!"  Reddit was overrun with people sharing pictures of their WFH "battlestations" and laughing about how they only needed to do 5% of their actual job because no one was supervising them anymore.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I'm working at a hospital and it's business as usual.  "Healthcare workers are HEROES!"  "lol but for real go to work while we lounge around and hoard toilet paper, thanks"</p>

<p>Even before the pandemic, Ms. Reece, the Kroger clerk in Mississippi, was wearing a mask to protect herself from the flu because of her cancer diagnosis, she said.</p>
<p>I say BULLSHIT! No she wasn't because no one had made up the lies that a rag on your head stopped the flu. However, if her delusions led her to believe she did or it stops the flu, she can wear 2 now! According to Fucki, one does nothing &amp; he demands 2 anyway. </p>
<p>Fuck Fucki &amp; fuck the government. Anyone remember that the "2 weeks" was to increase hospital capabilities so they could treat patients? What really happened besides the brief show biz of 'temporary ERs'? Oh, right! They fucking shut down facilities!!!!!!! Laid off medical personnel due to lack of work!</p>

        <p>Ummm there‚Äôs a vaccine available to anyone who wants it. </p>
<p>This lady claims she hasn‚Äôt been able to get the vaccine because of ‚Äúallergies.‚Äù I‚Äôm gonna call BS on that. </p>
<p>We are also testing about 10-15 times as much as we were this time last year. </p>
<p>Also there‚Äôs treatments we know decrease mortality, chance of hospitalization, and length of hospitalization. </p>
<p>Also there‚Äôs a shitload of people who are now immune either from natural immunity or vaccine. </p>
<p>All in all I‚Äôd say pretty much everything has changed since this time last year.</p>
