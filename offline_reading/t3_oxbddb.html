    <strong>Vaccination status at work</strong>
    <p><p>My employer is requiring we provide our vaccination status.  It seems like we can also decline to answer.</p>
<p>Which response is better?  Say not vaccinated, or decline to answer.  What are the repercussions of declining to answer?  If I decline to answer, what exactly should I tell my employer?</p></p>

        <p>Decline to answer. Don't be confrontational. If they ask why you are declining to answer, tell them you don't feel comfortable sharing that information. If at any point you feel they are threatening your job, tell them that you'd prefer to respond in writing and ask them for a few days. Then speak to a lawyer about how to best proceed.</p>

        <p>I agree that he can probably be forced to disclose. But the next step after disclosure will be them trying to force him to take the drug, and depending on his state, he may have options to fight that. My point about the lawyer telling him how to proceed also covers how to handle communications around this issue with his employer, so as to prevent giving them a legit cause to terminate him, and keeping a written history of all communications in case he ends up suing them for terminating him for refusing the drug later.</p>

        <p>I want to emphasize how correct you are with everything you just said. Keep records, it never hurts and could only help. But as you said it's state by state, and their jurisdiction is limited.</p>
<p>Many plaintiffs lawyers will discuss for free, but I fear most reasonably won't touch it without law or precedent in the books currently.</p>

        <p>why in the absence of a specific law would the default be to required sharing of medical info with an employer rather than the reverse?</p>

        <p>Because laws establish causes of action. For example, your employer cannot fire you for being black, or chirstian, or female, and now even transgender. That's because Title VII, a federal anti-discrimination statute was passed decades ago and the courts have interpreted even more broadly than it was written. Without a similarly passed law establishing medical privacy rights between employer/employee outside HIPA, for now maybe there's a novel constitutional claim to make, you can always try, that would still likely take YEARS to resolve, and will be a little dinghy in rough waters the whole way. But there is no federal law <em>I'm aware of</em>, and admittedly even lawyers dont have the millions of laws memorized, that prohibits your employer under these circumstances from doing this. Without such a law saying, let's say, "Employers shall not inquire into or base an employment decision based on vaccination status." there's no precedent to sue on that basis and it's unlikely the courts, not the liberals and not even the conservatives, will read in a fundamental right under the 14th amendement, to be private in your medical status relative to your employer.</p>
<p>THAT SAID, Roe v Wade is 14th amendment precedent, a right to medical privacy was found there with NO mention of abortion or reproduction anywhere in statute or the constitution. It was just read into "equal protection" under the 14th am. So it HAS happened. It's just a hail mary right now. And there's already countervailing SCOTUS precedent that the government can require vaccination from the early 1900s. The precedent is literally already in the opposite direction, it's been tried and failed before, and private companies have way more robust 1st amendment rights, e.g., association, than the government. </p>
<p>Currently there is no generally applicable constitutional provision, statute, or case law that says you can sue your employer for that, unfortunately, and more unfortunately, there is precedent protecting their right to do that. </p>
<p>The law CAN be changed, but requires political luck and will to get in the right people into legislatures, courts, and administrations that will help us out. Right now, dems control the house, senate, and presidency, the main lawmaking bodies of the federal government.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, maybe there's a law. But that would have already been used if there were, trust me.</p>

        <p>They might be trying to decide if they are going to institute a mandate based on the responses. Does your employer get paid in any way by the government? Medical systems get reimbursed for medicare based on the percent of employees who've had the flu shot, so some started denying medical exemptions for that one several years ago.</p>

        <p>Sounds like you need to get a fake card or update your resume. It sounds like it could be an insurance thing. A lot of insurance companies are going to be updating their policies to say if you’re not vaccinated and you contract covid that they won’t pay for any treatments or subsequent tests. It has already started in Canada. It’s only matter of time before is happens in the US.</p>
