    <strong>My fellow parent's ...</strong>
    <p><p>What are we going to do?
I am reading that our kids unvaccinated will be required to wear masks while vaccinated will not .
The CDC is saying even out doors in a "hot spot "area high with " unvaccinated" that children over the age of 2 will need masks.
Last year my children complied, (I did not)
 Their masks at the end of day was some of the nastiest shit I've ever seen.
I can't do another year like this.
What do you all with kids plan to do? Give up, remove them? Vaccinating my little girls isn't an option for me.</p></p>

        <p>If homeschooling isn't an option, you might consider sending them to school with multiple masks so they can change it during the day. I sent my son to school with 2 masks, and his 'maskne' drastically improved once we started doing that. I bought him 20 masks so he always had clean ones to grab in the morning on his way out the door.</p>

        <p>Mine wants to be in person, but I am getting very close to snapping and figuring out homeschool even though I work outside of the home 40 hrs/week. If the vax gets mandated, mine is OUT. I am planning a move to a red county in a red state in less than two years. I'm done with this shit. 
Best of luck with homeschool. I'm sure you can find other homeschool parents to do fun stuff with. I am part of a huge group of fed up parents who either already homeschool or are about to start.</p>

<p>They have tons of info on how to homeschool, it doesn't have to look like you think it does. You don't have to keep the same hours as public school and it definitely takes less time to get through their lessons.</p>

        <p>Not all school districts are doing this.  If you have financial resources move or find a private school that doesnâ€™t require masks. Iâ€™d you have time but not money, consider home schooling.  There a good curriculums that you can buy for not is much.  If you are friend with other parents who feel the same way, you could pool your resources to hire a private teacher.  Go to school board meetings and fight this.</p>

        <p>I'm in Oregon, just outside Portland (ðŸ™„) I never masked and I have and will never mask my children. Even more so now I will refuse.</p>
<p>I homeschool, joined a group and we are having a good time. Mine are 5 and 3, so in some cases it is easier, but at any age I would make it work to keep them freely breathing.</p>
<p>The public and even most private schools here are atrocious. They promote Critical Race Theory and this bullshit Math is Racist crap. Homeschooling is not exactly easy but it isn't hard either. It takes planning, commitment and dedication. Remember why you are doing it and you will succeed. Find a group of homeschoolers, makes getting help easier. I get my books from used book sales or even from the library if I want a preview before buying. </p>
<p>I recommend buying your first curriculum set as a first timer, makes it easy because its all laid out. It will look expensive but you will see that you can make it as costly or cheap as you want/need.</p>
