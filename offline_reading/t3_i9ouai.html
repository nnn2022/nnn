        <p>Significantly less. Herd Immunty would stop it.</p>

<p>Sweden was predicted to have over 300k cases and 100k deaths, then had like 6k deaths. It is done over there.</p>

<p>While over here in the US, we are completely drawing this out longer than needed in order to hold control, push a narrative, and, among other things, help out China and make some money.</p>

        <p>This is of course the correct answer.</p>
<p>What no one, including government seems to remember is that flatten the curve was just that.  Never meant to reduce deaths, just spread them out.  The area under the curve (total deaths) remains the same.</p>

        <p>About the same or maybe even less. If we had completely ignored COVID, then we wouldn't have so many deaths counted as COVID deaths when the person did not die from COVID. We also wouldn't have these ridiculously high positive tests because tests wouldn't be over counted and there wouldn't be so many false positives.</p>

        <p>The same number or less than died with the measures.  Remember 94% of the deaths have an average of 2.6 additional causes of death.  Those people were going to die no matter what.</p>

        <p>Until now or Long term? Long term like a year or so, we would get way less without regulations, Around the normal mortality level. But with regulations, even if everything is lifted tomorrow, there will be detrimental long-term effects for several years to come and overall mortality will increase, you may see 1% for next year which is huge. Maybe more.</p>
<p>Short term in the first couple months I would say we would seen a bit more on mortality by covid like 0-5% vs on top of what we see now, it would vary by population density in different areas.</p>
<p>For most, the pathogen's challenge should be negligible. However economical, social, mental issues etc, are extremely detrimental and challenging and can last a lifetime. And this is where the computer models used to calculate infection and mortality, will not work correctly. Because such a computer program treats every single person on planet earth, pretty much the same. It assumes that everyone will have the same response to the pathogen and then a random generator is used whether you live or die. But that's not how life works. There is an infinite number of factors that will influence the process each moment. And they are not taken into account.</p>

        <p>With <em>no</em> measures at all, hospitals might be overrun and causing extra deaths. It depends on the overall health of the population and the state of the health care system though.
But it would certainly still be a lot better than the more draconian lockdowns regardless.
As for more light restrictions, they may be justifiable, but only during the <em>peak</em> of the epidemic.</p>

        <p>The rise in new cases coincides to when restrictions were loosened/ignored. </p>
<p>Fall in new cases coincides to when restrictions were tightened and ignored.</p>
<p>As such, it seems to be that less restrictions leads to more new cases. Correlation is not causation, but based on a short term analysis, it seems only logical that more cases would equate to more deaths.</p>

<p>This though is the problem.  While your basic argument is correct, it only works while restrictions are in place.  The virus does not go away.  Unless you can keep an entire area locked down, it comes back and boom more cases.   See New Zealand, Spain, et. al. </p>
<p>Over time, the same number of people die.  You just spread it out.</p>
