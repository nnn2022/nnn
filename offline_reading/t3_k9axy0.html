<title>'V-Day' - That's right, they are comparing themselves to the men and women who freed Europe from Nazi Germany... Also, did you know it's not one shot? It's two doses, three-to-four weeks apart. I'm sure that won't cause any problems with shortages and needing to start over or any complications.</title>

        <p>Wow. That’s messed up. That is not how this is at all. They are the ones injecting a lethal unknown toxic substance of poison. Uhmmm that’s not liberating.... that’s just called murdering a bunch of people for the sake of an agenda. You know. Depopulation. Kinda what the Nazis were after. Exactly what Gates and his buddies want. They want to reduce our numbers from 7 billion to 1 billion. They’ll achieve it through this vaxx. Whoever’s left will become so transhuman the thought of freedom will be completely foreign to them. Back into the box you go and no more reproduction. They’re gonna shut you off. </p>
<p>If you’re a health care worker pushing this agenda you are a monster. </p>
<p>If you are speaking out, thank you! You are a true hero. Stay strong.</p>

        <p>&rt;  Exactly what Gates and his buddies want. They want to reduce our numbers from 7 billion to 1 billion. </p>
<p>I'm all for bringing the fight, but I like to point out problems when I see them. This argument is based off of a misread of Gate's comments in some Ted Talk where he is talking about overpopulation.</p>
<p>I bet if you link me to the video of "Bill Gates Saying Vaccines Will Lower The population" what we actually will see is bill gates talking about vaccines and "Reproductive Health Care" which is fancy talk for planned parenthood abortions. And you will see that Bill is actually talking about Abortions on demand in 3rd world countries to slow population growth.</p>
<p>I know this, because I had a friend make the same claim, provide the video, and we parsed the words. Id be happy to do it with you if you want to pull the video speech that convinced you.</p>
<p>Bill gates is not saying he wants to use vaccines to lower the population. He isn't. He is saying he wants to use abortions and birth control in 3rd world countries.</p>

        <p>This goes deeper then just Gates. Gates is a puppet of a much more exclusive group of elites. He is go-between. I don’t need to do anymore research on him. He is only a puppet. </p>
<p>There is a depopulation transhumanism agenda here. This is not a new agenda. This is agenda 21 playing out. ID 20:20. Project Mockingbird. All these conspiracies can no longer be called conspiracy when it’s happening before our own eyes. Gates does not give a shit about your health, nor the government, and certainly not big pharma. Sick people more money. Unhealthy people are easier to control. This was all pre planned.</p>

        <p>How about this, I’ve done enough research on Gates that he makes my stomach sick. I really hate everything about that guy so I’ve learned all I need to of him. He’s evil and he deserves everything he gets. </p>
<p>Anyways, this woman you posted is a crisis actor and this is propaganda. She’s already famous.</p>

        <p>Buddy, you parroted a common accusation that is false. I explained exactly how it is false. If you want to ignore that, that's on you. At this point I feel like your post is a mad libs and isn't really related to what I say at all.</p>
<p>Here is the ted talk:
https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_innovating_to_zero/transcript?language=en</p>
<p>&rt;First, we've got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, <strong>health care, reproductive health services,</strong> we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3. </p>
<p>Like I said, he is talking about exporting all the american abortions to the countries that don't abort their kids</p>
