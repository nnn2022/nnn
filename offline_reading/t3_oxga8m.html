    <strong>Concerned but Optimistic</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys! Been a part of this group for a little while (about a year) and it’s been a great help for my mental sanity. One of the things I’ve been trying to work on with ranging success has been my weight. Before COVID, I was on track to have lost 80 - almost 100 pounds. Over the course, I tried to keep active and eat well, but there were times I faltered.  As a result, I’ve gained about 25 of those pounds I lost back. I know that it is my doing and my choices alone that did this to me. </p>
<p>The reason I’m talking about this is because there’s a lot of correlation between COVID mortality and obesity, and while I am now wide awake and making active choices to improve my health, including taking Vitamin C, D and zinc daily, and I’m still only 27 so I’m still young, I’m still concerned about the repercussions should I catch it. My mother and my sister both had the virus and made it out just fine - no hospitalizations, just a few days of rest. What’s funny is that we lived in the same house and had multiple interactions in close settings for sometimes hours at a time before we knew they were positive and I still never got it “officially.” I had a bad sore throat just as their COVID was waning, but I tested negative. </p>
<p>I don’t really know why I posted this - I think I just needed to vent my concerns. I know whatever outcome I get - it was because of my choices and my decisions. But I just hope that whatever ends up happening- that I’ll be okay.</p></p>

        <p>Congratulations on your significant weight loss and also for your good attitude. Life is all about ebb and flow. The pounds you gained back will go away more easily if you try again. That said, a few extra pounds may come in handy as a survival strategy now that the globalists and their pets (Big Pharma, Big Tech, big corporations) are lining up to kill our food chain. Be smart and prep! Also good luck.</p>

        <p>The BEST way to lose weight is to eat "clean"! Look up "Eat-Clean Diet" by Tosca Reno. It helped me lose 25 pounds over one summer.</p>

        <p>Good for you getting healthy! I was 180 (5’6”) and 9 months pregnant when covid started… down to 125, added some healthy muscle tone and feel great. I’m not going to lie, I did drink more last year than usual, but getting healthy is the best thing you can do for yourself covid or not!</p>

        <p>I also gained weight I had so diligently lost pre-covid. I was down 85 lbs and put 20 back on when covid started. I am a FLHC worker on the designated C19 unit at my facility, and it was stressful times that led me to consuming a bit more food and alcohol than necessary. If you haven't struggled with an eating disorder in the past, I highly suggest intermittent fasting. since August 2020, I have lost the 20 I had gained, plus another 15 putting my total loss at 95lbs. Right now my fasting schedule on my days off is 18:6, and on days I work I do "eat, stop, eat" (eat a small breakfast and then fast until dinner) so I don't risk becoming hypoglycemic at work.</p>
<p>The benefits of fasting are numerous, including calming inflammation and reversing NAFLD. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you were to get sick with C19, I would suggest a juice fast while recovering.</p>
