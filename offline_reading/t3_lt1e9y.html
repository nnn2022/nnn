    <strong>"the hill you die on"</strong>
    <p><p>You have either seen it, heard it, or been asked it: "Is this the hill you die on?" Like parrots on que, doomers and morons alike tote this phrase around to shame and criticise those of us who refuse to wear a mask. It is supposed to bring shame because the issue in question - masks - seems like such a small one. Therefore, we are petty for standing against it. And, in truth, masks are a small issue. They're not wrong; 6 square inches of fabric is really no big deal.</p>
<p>But those of us who refuse this "mandate" often either have foresight, experience, or a well rounded view on history, to justify our position. You see, the mask isn't the issue; the mask is just a mask. But we see if for what it really is: the tip of the iceberg. It is the lighting of a fuse that inevitably burns further along, and we all know where fuses lead. </p>
<p>"It's just a mask" became "just two weeks" became "just two more weeks" became "it's just a small business" etc etc. Now, some places are looking at vaccine passports. Here in Canada, people are fined if they don't go and pay $2000 to stay at a government approved hotel upon reentering the country. And can we just take a moment to appreciate that these people don't know how long 2 weeks is. It's been almost an entire year.</p>
<p>Recently, one of my friends finally asked me this question, right on que.</p>
<p>My answer has not changed. This IS the hill I die on. And it isn't petty. The reason we put our foot down at masks is because we know if you give them an inch, they take a mile. In this case, miles upon miles. </p>
<p>What we should be asking in response, is this: "Do you want to live in a world where you can be killed for not wearing a mask?" In other words, who would want to live in a world where something so petty is seen as worth killing someone over?</p>
<p>If I went to a store and someone put a gun to my head and said "Put on the mask", I am so sure of my conviction, I'd say "Just pull the trigger."</p>
<p>I prefer to live free, or die. Anyone who would suppose the life of a slave is superior to death is a coward. Death would be a sweet escape from this clown world. There is no benefit to living under totalitarianism.</p>
<p>Fear is not a virtue.</p></p>

        <p>The reason they think it is a "small issue" is because they really don't need to commit to anything to virtue signal, just say, look at me! I wear a mask! It's so easy and not uncomfortable! But the reason it is a huge issue is because whatever it may be, the government is still forcing you to wear something against your will. I have heard the "but seat belt laws!" crap over and over, as if it is in any way the same thing. They are giving you a uniform if you choose to be out in public, which is unforgiveable, and the same goes for stores, trying to bar you from buying food, even though they are a public accommodation, just because you aren't dressed the way they like.</p>
<p>Even worse is they're not just forcing you to wear something against your will, but they're forcing you to wear something laughingly ridiculous against your will. So yeah, that's where I draw a line. My parents constantly ask me "What good is your freedom if everyone's dead?" As if those are the only two options; freedom with no one left on the Earth, or people don't die but we have no freedom. I just say "What good is living if you're not free?" They never know what to say and always just tell me "This is only for a while, your precious freedom is coming back once it's safe" and all that BS, as if it's so unsafe now.</p>

        <p>Haha I had a former friend use the seatbelt law justification on me too. I told him there shouldn’t be any of those either since not wearing a seatbelt is a victimless crime. They are actually kind of the same thing, I don’t need the government protecting me from myself!</p>

        <p>True, if say a store my their own policy decided to for some dumb reason then whatever I will there is I need to go there and it's just an isolated thing. But this is not what it is, like you said it's the tip of an iceberg we are all about to crash into or have been in slow motion for a very long time now. Nowhere mandating it wanted it, it was forced through threats and pressure from other places. If they did not comply their business would go down and everyone lives dependent on it. It's a symbol of what is currently bringing about the end of society as we know it.  I'm not wearing that on my face, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing I willingly put it on.</p>

<p>"The Minister of foreign affairs of Canada requests, in the name of her Majesty the Queen, all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely, without delay or hindrance, and to afford the bearer such assistance and protection as may be necessary." </p>
