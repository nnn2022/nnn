    <strong>"Karl-Anthony Towns says he's lost seven family members to COVID-19"</strong>
    <p><p>If you follow the NBA, you may have heard that early this year, Minnesota Timberwolves Center Karl-Anthony Towns tragically lost his mother in April due to covid. This was devastating news, especially as a Timberwolves fan. </p>
<p>However, a more recent headline gave me pause. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/karl-anthony-towns-says-hes-lost-seven-family-members-to-covid-19/ar-BB1bDAD4">Karl-Anthony Towns says he's lost seven family members to COVID-19</a></p>
<p>My first reaction to this headline was also sorrow, but then I began to wonder what the odds are of <em>knowing</em> 7 people that have died due to covid, let alone knowing 7 <em>family members</em> that have died due to covid. </p>
<p>Nowhere in the article does it directly quote Towns saying he's lost 7 family members. I went searching for the direct quote, but the closest I got was an <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30451080/timberwolves-karl-anthony-towns-says-season-difficult-amid-court-tragedies">interview where he says he recently lost his uncle.</a></p>
<p>I'm not sure what to make of this story. I don't think Karl would lie about something so horrible, especially since he's actually lost two people close to him. However, if this was a wild media headline, then I feel as though he would make a correction. I have seen many headlines and TV commentators talking about Karl losing 7 family members, however I cannot find him actually confirming it. </p>
<p>What are everyones thoughts on this? Can anyone find Karl actually saying that he's lost 7 family members?</p></p>

        <p>I mean that sucks.</p>
<p>I've lost my income, my healthier lifestyle, hold on my mental illness, my healthcare access, my kids lost access to the best education...and I consider my family to be very fortunate so far in that that's all we've lost.</p>
<p>We have food, skills to obtain our own food, a home that we can still pay for, I've a stockpile of my medication for my illness (though it's running low but as of right now I can afford to see the doctor for a refill - what's the point though when I'll be denied medications without my passport soon ?)...so we're very fortunate and this is fucking hard.</p>
<p>Imagine how the growing homeless camps feel ? Those that are literally watching their children starve to death ? Those giving up their pets they've had for a decade because they can no longer afford their care ? Those whose businesses have had to close their doors forever ? Those whose family members died of depression, isolation..while they couldn't even go say goodbye because it's "too dangerous"...those who've lost children from illnesses that died alone because of the same </p>
<p>So sorry your 7 family members are dead, truly and deeply...but the world isn't about your 7 dead family members. It's about all of us collectively and the results are in - all of this shit combined is harming way more people than Covid is.</p>
