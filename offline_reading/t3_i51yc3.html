    <strong>I can't stand reading "JUST [fill in the blank]" anymore.</strong>
    <p><p>I can't stand hearing people use "just" anymore. </p>
<p>"Just stay home."</p>
<p>"Just wear a mask."</p>
<p>"Just homeschool your kids."</p>
<p>"Just work from home."</p>
<p>"Just stay six feet away from people."</p>
<p>"Just cancel your trip."</p>
<p>"Just don't pay your rent."</p>
<p>Just.. just... just.. like, stop acting like people losing their livelihoods, their sanity, their family, their friends, their reasons for wanting to live is nothing. It's so telling that people who claim to care about others lives so much use language that is so diminutive towards the concerns that aren't their own.</p>
<p>My friends and family who are afraid of this virus and generally have very real reasons to be (age, lung problems, etc.) don't tend to speak this way. They see why people are concerned. They want the best outcomes for everyone. The friends (usually friends of friends) who act this way tend to be the least at risk for anything. They're just loud and always on whatever bandwagon is passing through.</p>
<p>Yeah though... needed to rant. Anyone else tired of "just" and the whole minimization of giving up all normalcy?</p></p>

        <p>Very tired. And it’s just running me off social media tbh. Used to be a big proponent of checking in and posting pics. Why? I’m not sure now. I don’t owe anyone any access to what I’m doing. I guess I wanted to share my zest for life with people. But now since having zest for life means I’m evil and want people to die, I’m working on finding my inner peace and zest without feeling the need to share it. If people want to push others away, ill let them push me and I’ll just go off and go about my life without anyone knowing what I’m up to. Before computers and the internet, people just did shit because they enjoyed it and rarely did anyone know what anyone else was doing. I’m getting back to that now because sharing any kind of joy is just frowned upon now.</p>

        <p>I learned that if you don't agree with the masses, anything you post can be used against you. I also learned that very few people <em>actually</em> give a shit about your life. I will say that I have kept my profiles active because I have family literally all over the world and it's easier to share that way, but I post a lot less now, and I've also cut a lot of people out since the pandemic. And I'm positive they didn't even notice or care,  so win-win.</p>

        <p>Same here! As an outdoor enthusiast, I love going hiking in the nearby mountains and forest. Before the pandemic, I loved posting my scenery and wildlife photos on Facebook, to share with friends and also with local hiking and photography groups. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't feel comfortable posting my photos of outdoor adventures on the groups, as you get harassed, yelled at, called "selfish", and told that you are killing people, for being outdoors. Apparently, these people never got the memo that you are safer from the virus outside, and seem to still believe that it is some magical virus that only spreads on beaches and hiking trails, but not in casinos, bars, hardware stores, or airplanes. Like, seriously, I thought we disproved the Miasma Theory?</p>

        <p>They say "just" because it's so low effort for them; they honestly don't care about "just wearing a mask" or "just staying inside".</p>
<p>But they've shown their utter lack of empathy for anyone else's wants/needs - they literally don't give a shit how hard/impossible it is for YOU to wear a mask or stay inside or have your mind slowly unravel from being caged or contemplate suicide because everything that gave you joy has been made illegal. They couldn't give two shits, because for them, it's "just" a little inconvenience.</p>
<p>They're sociopaths. Like, <em>actual sociopaths</em>, and I mean that very sincerely. They completely lack empathy and understanding of anybody but themselves.</p>
<p>Also, I'm really sorry you're going through this. I hope you're ok.</p>

        <p>I completely agree with you here. Also, how staying inside 90% of the time is just an inconvenience for anyone truly boggles my mind. I dont see how anyone could be contemplating on going outside only for essentials until a vaccine is ready. Utter madness. Even if I was high risk I genuinely couldn't fathom it. Its actually torture to be imprisoned inside for long periods of the day.</p>
<p>Also, i have to wear a mask all day at work and it is more than just an inconvenience. Interesting how no one cares about the fact that I've had to brave going into work during the pandemic and risking my life. Yet if I wanted to hang out with some friends and relax we are suddenly murderers.</p>

        <p>Yep. We ARE doomed and Americans ARE fucking retarded, but not for the reasons these idiots think they are. </p>
<p>We're doomed because Americans have zero ability to think critically and are happy to acquiesce with destroying their own economy and former way of life, while stripping themselves of basic freedoms and allowing Big Brother to encroach further and further into their daily lives. </p>

        <p>It feels like this break from normal American ideals came so suddenly, right?  I know there has been a growing culture of people thinking government is necessary in so many more aspects of daily life than the founders could have imagined.
Since I was a kid I see a pretty drastic change in the culture in terms of a shift away from personal responsibility.  I remember when all of the fun dangerous stuff at the park was taken out because the city must have been sued.</p>
<p>I think an important part of childhood is getting tastes of independence with the subsequent pain of doing something dumb and hurting yourself and learning to avoid such things in the future.   These days it seems like parents are so afraid of their kids getting hurt, perhaps people get a sense of invincibility.  So then something like coronavirus and then it shatters the illusion and they do whatever they can to get a sense of control over it including shunning everyone who doesn't share their terror.</p>
<p>Going back to your point, they need to feel protected and have some big tough guy like these governers who is doing to almost anything to give them that sense of safety at the cost of so many other citizens (business owners, children, bartenders etc.).</p>

        <p>Looking up the etymology of the word in a quick google search, it looks like “just” was being used as “exact” or “righteous” (14th cent) long before it was being used as the example you give which serves to reduce the force of an imperative (c. mid 1600s).</p>
<p>Remember that, the word “just” in the context of “just wear a mask” is being deliberately inserted to dampen the force of the command, to manipulate you into compliance. The only effective response is to ignore it. Ignore junk behavior and it will go away. Do not deign to dignify it with any engagement.</p>

        <p>I can't stand that "Just stay indoors until it is safe to go outside. Going outdoors is selfish". I have not been listening to that at all. I have been going outside taking walks every day. I'm lucky to live right next to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, so there are plenty of secluded spots to explore. </p>
<p>For one thing, we are safer outdoors, as this virus mostly spreads indoors, in crowded buildings with poor ventilation. Also, we need to boost our Vitamin D levels, since the Covid-19 mortality rate is higher in those with deficiencies. My levels were very low, so I need all the sunlight I can get. I just don't get why people want everyone to stay indoors. That mentality is killing people.</p>

Your friends who spread this shit around just want to look virtuous with minimal effort or they want to hide from the mob that will tear them apart for dissenting. </p>
<p>As for the policies themselves, they come from the top. They come from tyrants using the media to make these ideas cool. It's insidious, it's devastating to people's sanity and livelihoods, and, unless we cut the head off of the monster, it will destroy us.</p>

        <p>This is an excellent observation of new speak developing in real time. Throughout history “Just” has been used in many ways.</p>
<p>Here is the definitIon copied from Merriam Webster’s dictionary website:</p>
<p>&rt; just adjective
\ ˈjəst  \
Definition of just (Entry 1 of 3)
1a : having a basis in or conforming to fact or reason : REASONABLE
had just reason to believe he was in danger
b : conforming to a standard of correctness : PROPER
just proportions
c archaic : faithful to an original
2a(1) : acting or being in conformity with what is morally upright or good : RIGHTEOUS
a just war
(2) : being what is merited : DESERVED
a just punishment
b : legally correct : LAWFUL
just title to an estate</p>
<p>&rt;just adverb
\ ˈjəst  , ˈjist, ˈjest also without t \
Definition of just (Entry 2 of 3)
1a : EXACTLY, PRECISELY
just right
b : very recently
the bell just rang
2a : by a very small margin : BARELY
just too late
b : IMMEDIATELY, DIRECTLY
just west of here
3a : ONLY, SIMPLY
just last year
just be yourself
b : QUITE, VERY
just wonderful
4 : PERHAPS, POSSIBLY
it just might work
just about
: ALMOST
the work is just about done</p>
<p>Looking up the etymology of the word in a quick google search, it looks like “just” was being used as “exact” or “righteous” (14th cent) long before it was being used as the 3a example above which serves to reduce the force of an imperative (c. mid 1600s).</p>
<p>Remember that, the word “just” in the context of “just wear a mask” is being deliberately inserted to dampen the force of the command, to manipulate you into compliance. The only effective response is to ignore it. Ignore junk behavior and it will go away. Do not deign to dignify it with any engagement.</p>
