    <strong>my school legitimately knows I may or may not kill myself over their actions, and they won’t even acknowledge it so long as it’s not covid</strong>
    <p><p>School’s staying closed probably for the rest of the year, maybe longer. I’ve told everybody that would listen that I can’t take this anymore, heavily hinting that I’m suicidal but not straight up saying it because I don’t want to get reported. All I got were answers along the lines of ‘that sucks, but stay strong we’re all in this together and this will end!’, if they bothered at all. Then I found an anonymous FAQ site, and did say it. Probably half a dozen times. And they won’t even acknowledge the fact <em>they might play a part in killing an otherwise healthy teenager</em> just so that other people don’t get scared. They can’t even copypaste the suicide hotline like everybody else does. They just keep screeching about the cases!!! and the fact that if we are in a room with one (1) other person we will kill all grandmas in a mile radius before dying a slow torturous death in a pool of blood ourselves.</p>
<p>crazy stuff.</p></p>

        <p>If you are having suicidal thoughts I implore you to call the National Suicide Hotline 800-273-8255.  As harsh as I come across your life matters to the people around you.  Reach out for help and support.  You've taken the first step here.  Take the next step and get help and love to get you through this difficult time.  Other than when I'm at work I'm a DM away if you need to talk to someone.  </p>
<p>I'll be sending up good thoughts and positive vibes for you my friend.  :)</p>

        <p>I really don't think your statement is appropriate to the discussion.  The OP actively says they are considering suicide.  I'm reaching out to them to let them know that even an internet stranger cares.  As harsh and blunt as I seem self harm is not something I think is a good option.  I want to let them know that they are not alone and they have a resource to lean on if they need to.</p>

        <p>This is the same person on another throwaway- I keep fantasizing about going to the next reopening zoom meeting, turning my camera on and shooting or hanging myself. The people that did this to me would never be able to fucking forget it. I’d make the news.</p>

        <p>I feel what you’re going through.. I’ve never felt so depressed in my life as well. It’s scary where the mind can go. I want to fight back but just have no idea how or where to start. Every time my school has questionnaires, I seriously fill them out over &amp; over, complaining about the nonsense. Although it seems like nothing makes a difference currently, this community on Reddit has been helpful .. it’s somewhat comforting to know others aren’t brainwashed or blinded. Don’t make permanent decisions over something temporary. I know it seems far fetched but we have to all band together &amp; fight it!</p>

        <p>Perhaps you can channel your energy into something more productive while protesting. Get all like minded people to gather together and force the issue. What happens when half of the class gathers together on a zoom call so that you guys can act like normal people while everyone else lives in fear? Are they going to arrest you for it and put you in jail, where you would be at greater risk of spreading the virus? The more people that peacefully protest, the harder it will be for these authoritarians to continue their oppression.</p>
<p>Do not break any laws, but if there are unlawful regulations violating your constitutional rights, don’t give into those. Perhaps you even have a history/civics teacher past or present, that can see the value in these types of demonstrations and help put them together, although they may also fear for their own job. Suicide is the easy way out, fighting for what you believe in when half the country will call you a racist and grandma hater is much tougher, but there is a real payoff and we can all make a difference!</p>
