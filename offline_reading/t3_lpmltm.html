    <strong>Severe anxiety</strong>
    <p><p>I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder as a teen but managed to get it under control over the years. This past year it got so much worse than ever before, because of everything that's been going on and especially the last couple of months since the whole vaccine situation started here (I live in Israel).</p>
<p>I'm trying to spend less time on my phone/computer and stopped watching the news but it's very difficult to avoid it altogether because the covid news coverage is 24/7 on the TV and literally every time I turned the TV on I hear something like "everyone should get vaccinated, what's the problem?" or "anyone who doesn't get vaccinated won't be able to travel abroad or go to certain places, and they'll have to eventually get the vaccine". Stuff like that. That's the only thing the media is showing, no one voices any other opinions other than "EVERYONE HAS TO GET THE VACCINE!!!!!!"</p>
<p>I have constant tension headaches and have lost all sense of joy in life. Nothing seems to matter anymore and it feels like life won't get better or "normal". It's like we're stuck in a nightmare. I'm so scared, all the time. It doesn't help that most of the time I'm alone at home and I've been unemployed for 9 months now.</p>
<p>Anyone else feels this way or maybe found practical ways to deal with it?</p></p>

        <p>If it is an option, escape to any part of open nature that you have access to. And I don't mean city parks, just take the bike, car or walk. Helps immensely. If that is not possible, take a walk in a piece of the city that's not a main district, like a suburb. Most people there disregard the covid shit except when they need to go to the store and seeing less police officers/soldiers may also ease the anxiety. I personally try to find humor in and laugh at the absurdity of the mainstream media instead of being horrified by it.</p>

        <p>There aren't many police officers now that most of the restrictions are lifted, but unfortunately most people are  wearing masks everywhere (even in their cars) so even going outside for a walk is a bit stressful. All I see are people in masks, I forgot what it's like to see actual faces around me.
Even in the suburbs you can't escape it. I think it's the hardest part, seeing it everywhere. It's not legally required to put a mask on when you're jogging or doing any sports activity outside, but last time I tried going for a walk/jog and went without a mask people stared at me and someone even shouted from their window "why aren't you wearing a mask?".</p>

        <p>Having a hobby helps a lot. You find something to do in your free time and you automatically think less about what's going on. I personally got into woodworking. If you have a garage and some tools, you could probably even make some cash on that.</p>

        <p>I don't have a garage, we live in a small rented apartment. Most people in Israel live in apartments, unfortunately, especially young people.
Tried a few hobbies but lately I just can't concentrate on anything at all. Embroidery, yoga, cooking, learning a new language.</p>

        <p>Try CBD or kava if you can. Kava isn’t great for your liver so not the best thing to do all the time but CBD has no health drawbacks as far as I know. And you don’t get high from it. Valerian root is good too. Melatonin for sleep.</p>
<p>(Sorry for just recommending chemical solutions but I’ve found nothing else really works and none of these things are pharmaceutical except I guess melatonin but it’s harmless)</p>
