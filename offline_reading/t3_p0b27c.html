        <p>Let’s take this study </p>
<p>https://c19ivermectin.com/limamorales.html</p>
<p>It shows effectiveness of a mix of Ivermectin, Azithromycin, Montelukast, and Acetylsalicylic acid. </p>
<p>This doesn’t show the effectiveness of Ivermectine alone. And that’s why the NHI says what it says.</p>

        <p>That’s completely false. 
If you aren’t a specialist you aren’t qualified to understand whether a study might be mistaken. You are only reading the conclusions without understanding the details.</p>

        <p>In that case you can't understand or have an opinion about the shape of the world, our position in the solar system, etc. unless you're an astronomer. You can't have an understanding or opinion about anything unless you're a specialist in that field. Because after all, the studies and such that show the world is an oblate spheroid could be wrong and you have no authority to say they are right because you aren't a specialist so you can't possibly know if the studies done are true or not.</p>
<p>Actually that goes the opposite way. The "studies" claiming Ivermectin isn't effective, I can't possibly understand them or the details so why should I believe them any more than the ones saying Ivermectin works?</p>
<p>Sorry, but we aren't blind sheep like you, we actually use our brain.</p>

        <p>Not really because you don’t need studies to understand that the world is round. </p>
<p>However you need them to show that the world isn’t perfectly round. </p>
<p>And if you checked studies on whether the world is round, you’d find that about 100% of them say that the world is round. </p>
<p>In this case however, studies show between 50 and 80% of effectiveness of Ivermectin in cocktail with other treatments. </p>

<p>Appeal to majority fallacy. Just because nearly all the studies agree on something, doesn't make it true. What makes it true is the preponderance of evidence that has been rigorously tested and seen the same results.</p>
<p>&rt;In this case however, studies show between 50 and 80% of effectiveness of Ivermectin in cocktail with other treatments.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty good to me and at least as effective as the claimed effectiveness of the covid shots. Except we have decades of research and long term studies with Ivermectin, and only about a year for the covid shots.</p>
<p>&rt;There isn’t enough information about effectiveness of Ivermectin alone, or of dosage, or of side effects due to chosen dosage. Clinical trials are few and with small samples.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That is why NHI, FDA, EMA, WHO, AIFA and all others say that there isn’t enough information yet about Ivermectin and why non-experts shouldn’t take it.</p>
<p>There is enough so that Ivermectin could have been used as a treatment, certainly there's more studies and information than these covid shots. However in order for the covid shots to get emergency authorization there couldn't be any other viable alternatives; the untested shots had to be the only option. So they demonized Ivermectin to push the shots out the door to make that sweet cash from our tax dollars.</p>
<p>&rt;Listen to doctors.</p>
<p>Appeal to authority fallacy. Just because they are a doctor doesn't mean what they say is always right. You should do your own research, examine the various pieces of evidence, seek other opinions, etc. and come to your own, informed conclusion. If you disagree I can show you a bunch of doctors who agree with me; you'll change your tune real quick then and say "no not those doctors!" or "you're cherry picking!"</p>

        <p>Imagine you witness an accident where someone ends up unconscious. You have two people in front of you.

Yes, a majority doesn’t guarantee truth, but the probability of the majority being right, especially with the scientific method in the 21st century, is higher than the probability of the majority being wrong.

<p>Sounds like this is on the street, so neither. It should ultimately be up to the patient or failing that, the next of kin. Said responsible party should do their due diligence and research the effects and consequences of any suggested medical procedure. To give an example via long story short, my grandma was a good person and listened to her doctor when he told her to get chemo "just in case" even though her double mastectomy was highly successful and she felt wonderful. She listened to him and got two treatments of chemo then became hospitalized and died in a few weeks. So no, doctors don't know everything and their suggestions aren't always the best.</p>
<p>&rt;Of course the right course of action is to listen to the doctor. Because yes, appealing to authority for specialized matters is the right course of action.</p>
<p>Not always as I just described above. It's ok to heed a specialists advice, but if you're doing it because they are a specialist and not because that's what the evidence shows then you're doing it wrong.</p>
<p>&rt;In this case, you have not one, but all authorities agreeing with the fact that ivermectin shouldn’t be used prime over your non-expert analysis. We are talking about literally thousands of doctors vs someone with no college education.</p>
<p>Actually there are tons of scientists and doctors who agree Ivermectin works and should be used. Who do you think conducted all those studies proving it's efficacy?</p>

Yes, a majority doesn’t guarantee truth, but the probability of the majority being right, especially with the scientific method in the 21st century, is higher than the probability of the majority being wrong.

<p>This is what makes you a sheep and how you can get manipulated and mislead. Do the research yourself and see if it still agrees with what everyone else is saying. If it does, then you aren't following the majority, you are following the evidence. Follow the evidence not the majority.</p>

<p>Strawman argument. I never said I knew more than "experts", only that you should do your own research and come to your own conclusion. By all means include said expert's opinion in your seeking of the truth, but to just believe them without critical thought simply because of their position is a fallacy.</p>

<p>Seems you are referring to acute trauma as opposed to chronic issues. If I get hit by a car, shot, or whatever, the first people I'm going to is a surgeon because they are the ones with the skill and education to properly perform surgery. However when it comes to chronic conditions that's a different story. You aren't on the street bleeding to death, you have time to make an informed decision about your treatment. For the record, doctors are entirely useless when it comes to chronic conditions that are not the result of genetic disorders. My life improved drastically, cured my chronic migraines, and so on once I stopped listening to the "experts".</p>

        <p>No, no. If someone is in danger of dying in front of you and a doctor is present, the doctor will know more than someone who isn’t a doctor. It’s worrying that you can’t understand such a simple fact.</p>
<p>Also, it’s not a strawman argument. You don’t even know what RNA is for, yet you have the pretention to think that you can understand medical research. It’s pathetic and completely delusional.</p>

        <p>Good you read it! I am positively surprised. </p>
<p>How many people took Ivermectine in that trial?</p>
<p>Edit : I’ll answer : 128 or 10% of the people studied. </p>
<p>Conclusion : there is no way of knowing whether Ivermectin alone works, and most of the positive effects shown in this study ARE NOT related to Ivermectin.</p>

        <p>Ivermectin is a safer than the vaccines since it's been used for decades so they should be as willing to give it out like they're giving the vaccines. Same with HCL.
