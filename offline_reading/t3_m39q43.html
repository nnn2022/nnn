    <strong>Pro tip on how to avoid wearing a mask in public and not face negative looks from others</strong>
    <p><p>Always carry a drink (smoothie, water bottle, coffee, etc) in your hand and pretend to sip it. I don’t wear a mask outdoors and always use this.</p></p>

        <p>Problem is that on public transport and grocery stores they don’t let you in if you don’t have a mask. Its generally to keep out anti-maskers though but with this excuse they generally allow you in and don’t accuse you of anti-masking.</p>

        <p>I mean when they ask you to put it on (like on public transport) just act like yea you’re finishing your coffee.</p>
<p>The issue is that they don’t let you inside grocery/departmental stores or public transport without a mask.</p>

<p>I said politely "no thank you. I just wanna buy something."</p>

        <p>They let you in? Where I am, they force you to either wear it or don’t let you in. Thats why I use the “Oh I’m just finishing my coffee/soda/smoothie” excuse (sometimes its empty but the cup is opaque so they don’t know its empty and I pretend that I am drinking it) while I show them the mask in my pocket. </p>
<p>This way they don’t think I’m an anti-masker and usually let me in.</p>

        <p>Thats a shit move from the employee. Tbh this is one of the few incidences where I haven’t been denied entry. I just politely and casually mention “oh sorry I was just finishing my coffee/smoothie” and show him/her the mask in my pocket to prove that I’ll wear it later. Usually they’re chill with it.</p>

        <p>How fucking dare you compare the civil rights movement with your whiney self.</p>
<p>They are in no way comparable, one was a violation of rights and literally resulted in the oppression of a group of people to do pretty much any everyday activity without the fear of retaliation. The other is people getting upset that about doing a tiny little thing (TO SAVE FUCKING LIVES).</p>
<p>So get back to me when your little upset feelings over masks leads to you being driven out of your homes, sprayed by water cannons because you are barely allowed to exist or when your own neighbours are threatening to lynch you. Until then shut up you entitled privledged idiot and think of someone else for once.</p>

        <p>Um.. Yeah it's a little different but there are similarties. Besides, the point was to have the backbone to stand up for yourself.</p>
<p>What's happening right now is the oppression of ALL people. We're all being denied every day actives, and we're only getting bits and pieces of our freedom back even after getting fully vaccinated. We are losing ownership of our bodies. </p>
<p>Fuck you for refusing to look at the big picture. This attitude of throwing everything out the window to "SAVE LIVES" is why we're stuck where we are.</p>

        <p>But I am looking at the big picture. The growing number of avoidable Covid deaths is the big picture, the people who lose relatives and friends is the big picture. I get that you want things back to normal, I can agree with that but the issue is that currently doing those things are dangerous.</p>
<p>Cause although you are limited in what you do, it isn't oppression. Oppression is a long and cruel treatment from authority and what we are currently going through is not that for several reasons. </p>
<p>For one depending who you ask it may or may not be cruel, I personally don't think it is and you do. And that's okay, but I would argue true oppression is something that can be unanimously be seen as wicked and evil, with even those committing the oppression aware of it as they would not want it on themselves. Whereas that's not happening those supposedly doing the oppressing happily follow the Covid regulations.</p>
<p>And for second the only reason that this apparent cruelty has lasted so long is because people haven't followed the rules. If you look at nations like New Zealand they have gone back to normal, because they followed the regulations. So, even if it is oppression it is self inflicted.</p>
<p>I hope my response doesn't come of mean, I appreciate my first comment did and that's because I was annoyed. But with your response trying to having a discussion I have tried to return the favour and hope we can come to an understanding. Cause believe me I want all of this to be over too, it's shit but if we work together we can get through it.</p>

        <p>Well we see things a bit differently. Most of us at NNN see this drawn out ordeal as something being extended on purpose, as it does benefit big brother in multiple ways. For example a company like Amazon does better the more people are afraid to physically go to a store with other breathing humans. Amazon will soon simply drone everything everywhere. This pandemic was a massive wealth transfer from the middle class to the rich, and a saddening amount of small business are gone forever. </p>
<p>It's also moved just about every aspect of our lives to all digital. We now create more data than ever before for it all to be tracked.</p>
<p>Another worrying thing about all this is how there really seems to be no end in sight, like I said with getting bits and pieces back. In Biden's latest speech he said after we're fully vaccinated we can have small gatherings in our backyard for 4th of July. Not anything big, just a little gathering even when everyone's supposedly vaccinated. Do you not see a problem with that?! Isn't there supposed to be a point that we say "Okay, we're good now."?</p>
<p>One more thing I want to address is how strange it is that the push is for every single person to be vaccinated. We know from the data that covid for young people is even safer than the flu. It's the old people that have a tough time with covid. And the vaccine, if it works which we've been told it does, will prevent the elderly from getting a deadly reaction to covid. So why is every single person of all ages being pressured to take the vaccine? Why is it considered a bad thing for someone to want to get immunity the natural way? </p>
<p>I don't want to make this too much longer but I also just wanna briefly bring up that vaccine passports are being discussed and that just shouldn't ever become a thing.</p>
<p>There's just so much wrong with everything going on, and I think our main disagreement is that we should be able to live normally at this point if we want. We can't change the supposed 500,000 deaths that have happened and we're now on the decline of deaths with the vaccines and improved treatment compared to when this started.</p>
<p>Anyways it really just seems at this point like the media, Fauci and the like will never tell us it's safe to resume normal life, so for us to actually get through this we'll need to someday collectively stop obeying. If you ever come to that realization you know you won't be alone.</p>

Because you are not brave for not wearing a mask and you are just endangering lives and making the return to normal take longer.</p>

        <p>Masks don’t save lives though. This can be seen in the numbers. They don’t make a difference, and honestly the idea that they do in the first place is absolutely ridiculous. </p>
<p>Mask mandates are a violation of civil rights. Your civil rights as well as everyone else’s. You should be free to wear a mask if you want but this one way mask theory is absolutely bananas and you’re very naive for not taking the time to think critically about it.</p>

        <p>First that's not my point, it takes time for the tech to develop meaning we need to take time and that means regulations.</p>
<p>And it makes very much logical sense that surgical masks work. The basis of stopping disease is "coughs and sneezes spread diseases" which is stopped by covering your mouth while you do those things like when use a mask.</p>
<p>But also if masks don't work why have surgeons and stuff been using them then, you know to keep where they work more sterile.</p>

        <p>Almost as if COVID is more contagious and that it is been found to be primarily spread when people talk, and a mask would stop the small bits of saliva and such that would carry the disease while they talk. So, weird that masks work.</p>
<p>Also, how do you know your not sick, one of the big issues with COVID is the incubation period where you are asymptomatic but still contagious. So, a mask also helps in dealing with that.</p>

        <p>Also how is it “doing one tiny thing” to fUcKInG save lives when you compare numbers from different areas it’s apparent it doesn’t make a difference. People died of viral pneumonia by the tens of thousands every year before 2020 and no one was screaming about saving fUckInG lives then. </p>
<p>It’s not “doing one tiny thing”. You seem like someone who enjoys sociology, so would you really think that wearing masks in the way we do now (24/7 when leaving the house) doesn’t have any lasting implications for the mental health of society? </p>
<p>There are toddlers who have spent half their lives only seeing strangers as faceless entities. How long should this little thing continue?</p>
<p>You know it’s not a little thing but I’m gonna assume you enjoy wearing a mask for whatever reason, and that’s awesome for you. But masks are unnecessary and unnatural, because if we needed them for safety or comfort we’d have crafted them alongside stone tools.</p>

        <p>It saves lives if we all do it, it's like climate change where one person alone won't make a difference but as a mass of people we will.</p>
<p>And for the point about how will mask wearing affect our society I don't think it will, at least not in the long run. Cause this has happened in the past. During the 1920s pandemic people wore masks and we didn't talk about that until something similar happened to us. That clearly shows that it can't be a huge societal issue that will change how we act.</p>
<p>And even if it did, I would rather have societal change and have more people alive, then not wear a mask and cause yet more unavoidable deaths.</p>

        <p>How do you know people wore masks in the 1920’s? Because you saw that “wear a mask or go to jail” picture on /r/pics?? Because that’s a fake picture by the way.</p>
<p>People didn’t wear masks in the 1920’s the way we are doing so today. </p>

        <p>How do I know? Because I study history and had to do a presentation on the topic and how it relates today. (which is quite a lot). And after only a quick <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1920s+mask+pandemic&amp;client=ms-android-huawei-rev1&amp;prmd=sinv&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03LM9FvkC557M--XVpUlamFuUWRCg:1615571204360&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjh2Prdp6vvAhW3UBUIHQUoDPIQ_AUoAnoECAEQAg&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=711&amp;dpr=2">Google search</a> its clear that it was quite prevelant back then and was even seen as patriotic to wear one.</p>
<p>As for your other points they don't relate to the point we're discussing but I'll humour you. I don't think it is my place to force an opinion on abortion as a man, but if a woman wants to that's her choice. And I guess as society we should try and prevent deaths, by supporting the less fortunate and stopping world crisis like the genocide in China or the unnecessary wars.</p>

Put a piece of chewing gum in your mouth and put an open bag of beef jerky on your tray table in front of you.  It will look like you're eating jerky for the whole flight and yet the jerky will never run out.</p>

Next time I take a shit I'm gonna make sure not to wipe, just cause everyone else in the room can smell the little pieces of shit in my underwear, fuck them right? FUCK EM BABY WOO! Smell my ignorant, blissful ass cream.</p>
<p>My grandfathers had to fight in wars. OUR families were drafted into War. We were asked to simply wear a face covering in public places. That's it. Honestly, please for the love of Christ or God or your God or my God, G-R-O-W-U-P. <br>
And hey everyone who reads this, when the next pandemic comes that is Bacteria (Bacteria can transfer through surfaces ((surfaces being hard, or "solid" states of matter))) and the government encourages people to wear gloves and wash their hands, DO NOT BECOME SHEEP. YOU THINK FOR YOURSELVES AND YOU DO NOT WASH YOUR HANDS. TOUCH EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE. Get your gross germs all over everyone else's shit because fuck them. Freedom means doing whatever you want any time without consequence. Who's with me? FUCK</p>

        <p>I genuinely don't think this sub would exist if the government just said "We encourage you to wear masks", but ultimately allowed us to decide for ourselves. My main point is just that the dude I was replying to's argument is a bad one. Very few, if any people would be posting on this sub if it was just a simple recommendation and nothing more.</p>

        <p>Dude firstly I’m really sorry you lost your job. </p>
<p>However you probably didn’t lose it due to covid but due to the lockdowns imposed that caused the livelihoods of millions of workers like you. We’re all against that and for the livelihood and economic wel-beings of the working class, which is why we are against the covid restrictions. </p>
<p>Moreover, covid restrictions and masks do not work to prevent the spread, while destroying lives of working class people like me and you. Look at the per capita deaths in Sweden vs Belgium or Czechia; or NY vs Florida. 
You also prove that yourself since you probably wear a mask, follow guidelines and still got infected. If masks actually prevented covid, why did you get infected anyway? </p>
<p>Secondly, most of the cases aren’t even symptomatic and those that are, are usually very mild. It only causes severe cases if you have any other pre-existing condition which was gonna kill/damage you anyway. If you didn’t get tested, it’d have passed on anyway and you would have been immune. </p>
<p>Again I’m not criticising you or invalidating your feelings. As someone who also lost his job due to covid lockdowns, I understand and empathise with your frustration and anger. However its the covid guidelines that didn’t work and took away our jobs while making billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Elon Musk richer and more powerful.</p>

        <p>Honestly some of his frustration is valid and understandable. Like him, I also lost my job in April 2020 because of the pandemic restrictions. I’ve seen many others lose their businesses while big business monopolies like Amazon and Google grew significantly. I don’t think we should dismiss anyone’s concerns here. </p>
<p>However, people need to know that the current covid restrictions and strategies aren’t helpful, while destroying lots of working class people’s livelihoods.</p>

        <p>I lost my job at the end of May. My husband works in an outdoor event industry, so he was out of work too. We are raising 3 kids. I’m not medically able to tolerate a mask. Lately nobody cares that I can’t visit places like my LUNG doctor because I don’t want to get lightheaded. </p>
<p>It’s clear this guy is upset but he’s mad at the wrong thing. Blaming people for not following the restrictions is exactly what the government wants you to do. Bottom line: A virus cannot be controlled. All you can do is try to be as healthy as possible so your immune system fights it off. Being mad that people spread germs is not rational. It’s like being mad that it rains in Seattle or that it’s hot in Arizona. You can’t escape germs. Even super scary ones like e. Coli live in our intestines. And why are people afraid of just this one virus when millions surround us daily?</p>
<p>And yes, all of these restrictions should have been voluntary. In addition, the media should have been telling people how to be healthy. Vitamin D has been proven in many 2020 studies to be a huge factor in the strength and length of having the illness.</p>

        <p>The masks are ineffective. They didn't work in 1918, they don't work now. Forcing others to wear them like a religious talisman is worse than medieval superstition, and I will not abide. </p>
<p>As for grandparents who fought in wars, you know, I'm so glad you brought that up. My great grandfather fought for a country and an Empire that didn't even afford him the rights of citizenship because he was indigenous. When he got back, instead of recognizing his humanity the government proceeded to subject our ethnic group and hundreds of other indigenous nations to some of the worst persecution imaginable - for the public good. We're talking kidnapping children and sending them to institutions where they got raped, tortured, and murdered. To this day, continuing to forcibly sterilize women against their will. Allowing women and girls specifically to be murdered at astronomical rates with no right to defend yourself. "For the public good"</p>
<p>I may live in the US now, but forgive my healthy, <strong>healthy</strong> distrust of any government mandate that claims to be for the good of the public. This is a ruling class that hates you so much they wouldn't spit on your burning corpse if you were on fire. Stop pretending that any of these edicts have your best interest in mind. </p>
<p>Furthermore I lost my business that I built for years to this garbage. I like to tell people that if you want me to be pro lockdown, you can go right on ahead and compensate me for all my lost profits. Unless you've got a cheque at the ready, I don't wanna hear it.</p>
