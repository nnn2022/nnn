    <strong>would you accept to be vaccinated if pharmaceutical companies were worker owned cooperatives ?</strong>
    <p><p>and you could go there and learn how vaccine are made</p>
<p>also what if you could make your own vaccine (I know this might sound unrealistic)</p>
<p>also if there was no lockdown or anything, but people gave you free masks telling you there's a virus out there that's dangerous (and same as for the vaccine you could see by yourself whether it's useful and working and safe) would you put them on ?</p>
<p>and would you be ready to limit your time outside (not as much as in a lockdown but still) if you had proof there was actually a dangerous virus out there and it would help prevent others from getting sick ?</p>
<p>I'm not really trying to convince anyone that they should listen to the gov I'm just trying to know if y'all would be more willing to participate if the government actually did it's job correctly</p></p>

        <p>You’re thinking of some idealized utopia (which, to be fair, all socialists must - socialism only works in fantasyland). </p>
<p>As to whether the “scientists and doctors” are inherently more trustworthy than other people, we have plenty of evidence that the answer is no. There are countless instances of those “trustworthy” scientists and doctors engaging in blatantly unethical practices, lying about data, and otherwise committing fraud in their “studies.” Even better, the FDA, that noble government organization responsible for protecting the public from dangerous drugs, frequently discovers and then chooses to ignore these instances of fraud, allowing the fraudulent studies to remain published and unchallenged so that other doctors and scientists are making decisions based on data that the FDA knows to be incorrect.</p>

        <p>no, what does that have to do with anything? I just want one (1) vaccine to finish phase 3 clinical trials, then I’ll take it. Just one, one measly vaccine, could be literally any of them, to properly finish phase 3, get real FDA approval (NOT EUA) and be put on the market. I do not wish to be a guinea pig for free. If a big pharma company paid me up front $10,000 to do it and also gave me full rights to sue in case of an adverse event, sure. Otherwise no, lol.</p>

        <p>First off this vaccine was rushed.  Even if it was a worker owned company I still wouldn't trust it.</p>
<p>Second, free mask or not I still wouldn't wear one.  I mean they're telling us this Delta variant is deadly but NOBODY lists the death numbers from it.  That's a big red flag.</p>
<p>Lastly, if I felt a virus was so deadly and contagious that I risked my life by going outside, then yes I'd limit my time from home.  I wouldn't want the government to enforce lockdowns and make  everyone do the same though.</p>

<p>okay so you don't want to wear a mask because you think it's unlikely that the virus is actually dangerous, not about their efficiency, so do you think masks are just useless or are they also dangerous ?</p>

        <p>That's because you take personal responsibility for yourself, the risk you are willing to take when you leave your home every day, and will protect yourself as you feel you need to (or avoid areas if need to).</p>
<p>Cult of the Mask doesn't have this ability, as they have no agency at all in protecting themselves, and need EVERYONE ELSE to do it for them</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm reasonable. I followed the basic guidelines and even enforced them during my working hours at the beginning of the Pandemic^TM </p>
<p>I just stopped after I had covid. I had it once already so I'd be fine right? That's how every other disease worked.</p>
<p>Then they started up with all the bullshit and now I'm actively against it.</p>

        <p>These are interesting questions and I'm curious to see what people's answers are.</p>
<p>Honestly, I wouldn't accept the vaccine even if it was from a worker owned company. For my age group, my odds of dying from covid are extremely low. It's not worth the risk of a clot, heart problems, or weeks of menstrual bleeding, when it doesn't protect you from getting covid anyway. </p>
<p>Even if I could make my own vaccine, I wouldn't take it, because I honestly don't see the need. Most of my cousins have had covid and either didn't have symptoms at all, or recovered in a few days. Even my dad's 70-80 year old unvaccinated friends have recovered with no issues. Meanwhile several vaccinated people we know have become extremely sick.</p>
<p>I wouldn't wear a free mask at this point. I social distanced and wore my mask in public from last spring til this March. The time for that is past.</p>
<p>I wouldn't limit my time out at this point. I barely went out except for work and groceries for a year. I gave up a year of my life already. Not doing it again.</p>

<li>I would never take it even if it were a state-owned monopoly or not.</li>
<li>No need to make a vaccine against a disease for which most of the population survive it &rt;99.9% of the time.</li>
<li>The fact that someone needs to convince me of the existence of a dangerous airborne virus is proof that it is not dangerous. I would never use a mask because we have known since 1919 that masks do NOT work.</li>
