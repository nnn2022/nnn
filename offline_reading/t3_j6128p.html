        <p>THAT'S fucked up, and I think that's what my stereotype of people on this sub is. </p>
<p>People who have legitimate reasoning to not wear a mask (medical reasoning) or to not lockdown (financial reasoning) are the people who I am targeting here.</p>

        <p>My mom has problems when she has a lack of oxygen and she almost collapsed when she wore a mask so for that reason she cannot wear one and we had given her the least suffocating mask we had. I myself don't have much of an issue with masks.</p>
<p>I am anti-lockdown because I know that people have died or were affected directly due to lockdown such as those who died from suicide or delayed cancer treatment and as you mentioned those currently with depression or mental health issues for example. This is the primary reason why I am anti-lockdown and wanting these people affected by lockdown to get deserved recognition.</p>
<p>Hope that gives you some perspective from the kind of person you want to hear from.</p>

        <p>I am pro-lockdown because I know that people have unnessasaraly been exposed to or died from the virus itself (or due to complications it causes). Those who have been badly affected by lockdown do, in fact, deserve recognition, and they should be aided accordingly.</p>
<p>I'm not saying the way lockdown has been handled has been perfect - this kind of thing is unprecidented - but those who say no to lockdown in general confuse me as issues can and will be sorted out before we leave the virus in the past for good when a vaccine is found.</p>

        <p>I see, how many people do you know that have died of the virus? Also glad you agree with me about these guys getting their recognition because that is what bothers me most about lockdowns is how suddenly these people were ignored. I hope they get the recognition and care they need as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As for my mom. My dad will think of a solution so my mom can go out with us.</p>

        <p>&rt;wear your masks and lockdown when you're told. If not, try not to be horribly uncomfortable with COVID</p>

<p>Even doomer trolls are now admitting that the virus isn't that bad. Another of many small wins.

<p>Guarantee if you went to a Covid, news, or politics sub and said "Hey everyone, Covid is only horribly uncomfortable.", you'd be met with a storm of comments about how deathly scary and deadly it is by your fellow doomers. And likely wished death upon you, funny enough.</p>

        <p>Depends on your defenition of a doomer, I suppose. Personally, I automatically assume anyone who is pro-mask, pro-lockdown, and comes on here calling everyone idiots, leans more towards being a doomer - just be default.</p>
<p>Just want to point out that we're much (MUCH) more civil here when someone comes in with a differing opinion than essentially every other sub on Reddit is when someone even so much as mentions something that's not excessively pro-mask and pro-lockdown, or again, that Covid will cause "horrible discomfort".</p>

        <p>Try staying in your house for the last 11 weeks, being under night curfew for 8 of those, not being able to travel more than 5km from your home and being allowed out for only 2 hours a day. </p>
<p>That’s the rules here in Melbourne. </p>
<p>With no end in sight, your life relying on a daily set of numbers to be free. Every morning waking up, check the rolling average and wait for the next day. Sure some days you can go for a walk, maybe even see a friend but life has stopped here. Everyone is depressed, people are committing suicide because they can’t cope anymore. It’s sadistic keeping people’s lives on a daily set of numbers.</p>
<p>At some point enough is enough and you really start to question how much longer you can live like this.</p>

        <p>Hey, uh, person who was locked down for 6 months here.</p>
<p>Although I may be different from everyone here, I was quite motivated to do my best to prevent people from catching COVID.</p>
<p>I do understand that some people have severe depression, and I do reccomend a therapist to help (If you want to). However, there are other methods of communication with your friends and family that I personally used frequently to help with coping.</p>
<p>Things are being relaxed because of masks and quarrantines, because less people are getting COVID. That's the point of staying inside, man. There is an end in sight, you just have to look further than your damn face.</p>

        <p>You start with, ‘Y’all are kinda dumb, aren’t you?’ What are you expecting in the replies? It’s ‘kinda dumb’ to just assume your opinion is correct without having a discussion about the issue(s) at hand</p>
<p>You clearly don’t want to even entertain with open mindedness the arguments against blindly being told what to do. I’m guessing you live comfortably with no change to your livelihood from these draconian measures.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the real world, these Orwellian rules  are destroying hundreds of millions of people around the world that may never recover. Parents who don’t know if they’ll be able to feed their families next month, let alone in 6 months time. How are they going to pay their bills? Will they lose their homes? Will their kids go to university? These are just some of the very real issues for normal folk and this notion that we have to ruin our livelihoods because other people want to lock themselves away is beyond insane. </p>
<p>Why are we not repeatedly told to live a healthy lifestyle, exercise, eat healthy, drink less shit? Why are the morbidly obese more concerned with a virus with a 0.13% death rate then they are with the issues they are going to have with being fat fucks? </p>
<p>I’ll tell you why, because the government/media tells you what to be concerned or scared of. These idiots are so fearful of imminent death, yet they fail to see they’re much more likely to die before their 50 from a whole host of obese related issues. Why’s the government not shutting down the fast food industry? Banning alcohol/cigarettes? Because they do not care about your health. Even slightly.</p>
<p>How can people still not see that our governments and the media do not care about us. They give zero shit. Everything is about power and control, oh and don’t forget money. They aren’t our friend, they aren’t obligated to protect us and tell us the truth. They tell us what they want to us hear, how is this not obvious?</p>
<p>What’s coming will be 100 times worse than some flu. But yeah just wear your mask and lockdown when you’re told to, without question. Also, don’t forget to grass up your neighbour if they don’t obey and follow the rules. What next will you blindly abide to? </p>
<p>You’re one of them that would literally get on your knees and open wide while they destroy everything around you. </p>
<p>Anyway, whatever I say will not change your mind, it was made up along time ago and nothing will change it. Enjoy your masks and lockdowns they aren’t going away any time soon, regardless of whether we follow the rules or not.</p>

        <p>With plenty of sources that support masks, there are also plenty of data that show we have <strong><em>no idea</em></strong> of the efficacy of masks in a public setting, especially if the mask user isn’t following the required steps of sanitizing, not touching one’s face, washing, etc. <a href="https://jennifermargulis.net/cdc-mask-wearing-policy-not-supported-by-science/">(1)</a></p>
<p>We now have medical professionals that are signing an open letter from Belgium healthcare workers to end the authoritarian measures enacted by governments <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/open-letter-from-medical-doctors-and-health-professionals-to-all-belgian-authorities-and-all-belgian-media/amp/">(2)</a>...are <strong><em>all</em></strong> of these people wrong?  I do think that the “medical professionals” people describe are not experts in mental health or societal issues generally. Do you think the virologist who studies [terrifying] viruses all day considered the impact of the mental health of a population by dehumanizing them with masks?  </p>
<p>And while we’re at it, I haven’t even began to touch the long-term impact of children fearing the general public because <em>people they don’t know personally are effectively lepers...</em> And yes, there is science that ties children decoding facial expressions as a measure of success and social competence, so masking society will impact their development as well <a href="https://www.parentingscience.com/facial-expressions-for-kids.html">(3)</a></p>
<p>My meta-point is that our world is complex, and sometimes one answer doesn’t fit, so I’m just going to agree to disagree.  I’ll live my life... and you can continue to call people dumb who don’t agree with you. </p>
<p>Personal safety is...<strong><em>personal</em></strong>. I’m fine if you think you should wear a mask - you just have no right to tell me otherwise.</p>

        <p>You sound like one of the many people who has been enabled to be on a high horse because of a prevailing wind in some sectors that a certain ideology of people is to be looked down upon.  Well as desperation caused by these out-of-control dictator governors (which is going to come back as weather gets cold and these sons and daughters of bitches feel they have to "do something") increases, that wind will turn.  You're in the minority but don't know it.</p>
<p>Yes, I bristle at the anti-mask sentiment and wear a mask constantly myself when out; I find no valid reason against mask wearing.  A dictator shutting down whole business sectors on a gut feeling is where this country is drawing a line.  This pandemic is a personal responsibility issue, not a government mandate to destroy the fabric of our society to exert its power and/or show they are "doing something to combat" a low-mortality virus.  Some people will <em>never work again</em> solely due to the actions of state governors over the past seven months.  Do you not understand that this is unacceptable?  What's it going to take to drill these ideas through your heads as you sip your takeout Starbucks and attend your worthless (b)urn(l)oot(m)urder protests (just as you stereotype us, we stereotype you)?</p>
<p>You belong in China, not the U.S.  Hell, even go to Australia which is becoming like China.  Please move.</p>

        <p>Okay, here's some substance.</p>
<p>For what reason would a government willingly cripple its own economy by shutting down sectors?</p>
<p>Furthermore, what makes Australia similar at all to China? Have you seen China's behaviour towards literally anything?</p>
<p>The entire reasoning for lockdowns is to protect people who may be vulnerable to the virus. There is no other reasoning for this "destruction of society" - nobody is being silenced, because people can post here, which us unlike China, and countries are actively reporting their COVID data which is, again, unlike China.</p>
<p>Also, as a side note, fuck China in general.</p>

<p>People who are vulnerable to the virus should and are being educated to <em>protect themselves</em> and we should be protecting them as well by wearing masks.  It is not right that any government destroy society for the rest.</p>

        <p>They initially shutdown so we could keep cases down while we learn about the virus. </p>
<p>Now we know a lot more about it and it is not nearly as extreme as predicted. We have learned that masks are not proven effective, in theory yes, but still no proof in a public and ordinary setting, in fact with all the touching and re-wearing they can be catalysts for the virus.</p>
<p>The virus has continued to spread despite the restrictions and the restrictions have proved to be more detrimental than the virus: loss of jobs, bankrupt businesses, depression, suicide, domestic violence, substance abuse. </p>
<p>Each state’s government is doing different things. Some are not crippling society, like Wyoming, South Dakota, Idaho. Yet others are horribly crippling society: New York, California. I am struggling to understand why they want to continue in their damaging ways, yet others do not. </p>
<p>The same can be said for different countries: Compare Mexico and Sweden to England and  Australia.</p>
<p>You tell me why the inconsistencies. I’d really like to know.</p>

        <p>Don't recall seeing anything of that sort lately. There were a couple people recently who came under the guise of being civil, yet framed their questions to us to make us out to be idiots, consiparacy theorists, etc. Then proceeding to call everyone names in the comments anyway.</p>
<p>Guarantee if you legitimately came on here and wanted to have a rational, open-ended discussion with people here, it would happen. But my guess, by you now coming on here and calling everyone idiots and whatnot, is that you don't really want any sort of meaningful conversation.</p>

        <p>You aren't banned, the post is still up, and everyone was quite civil (including you) aside from one guy. I don't really see the issue or a reason that you felt the need to come back and make a post calling everyone idiots and trying to rile people up.</p>

<p>A man chooses, a slave obeys. Masks and distancing are literally magic spells which people have already embraced as actual prevention. If nothing else, the constant, obvious, shameless showing of the same talking points down my and everyone else's throats makes we want to <em>not</em> obey.</p>
