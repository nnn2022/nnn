    <strong>Local healthcare provider unable to answer simple questions about Covid, mask beginning to slip.</strong>
    <p><p>Evening everybody. Burner acct to conceal my identity as best i can.</p>
<p>I volunteer with my local healthcare provider and we had our monthly meeting a short while ago. <em>Our field has nothing to do with Covid, yet Covid dominates the discussion anyways.</em> I am kicking myself for not shadowplaying the Zoom call.</p>
<p>Meeting consists of volunteers, nurses, and other various administration.</p>
<p>I've built up enough rapport in four years of volunteer work that I was comfortably able to ask the <em>forbidden question:</em></p>
<p><strong>Will we still have to follow protocols such as masks, social distancing, and limited capacity events even after the majority of us have the vaccine?</strong></p>
<p>The answer I was given was... <em>they don't know.</em> One nurse in particular spoke up and admitted this was a very good question and she wants to know the answer as well which kind of indicates they haven't thought that far ahead yet. In short, there isn't a plan, and the nurse speculated that since the vaccines aren't mandatory, the (pathetic) Covid measures might be here for the long haul in an effort to protect the population who chose not to get the vaccine. There is no accepted compliance rate they are aiming for. There is nothing. Signs are pointing to this continuing indefinitely.</p>
<p>The memes about "why did I get the vaccine then?", or speculation about governments moving the goal posts in regards to what level of vaccine compliance is required to fully open up each country, are going to become reality.</p>
<p>Currently the vaccine compliance rate is low; the number I was given was 60 of 80 seniors. I'm not sure if that's accepted vaccine or refused vaccine due to Zoom being kind of laggy during calls with so many people, but the individual further elaborated that internally they are surprised so many people in an at-risk group have refused it.</p>
<p>The meme about there being more overdoses in our region than covid deaths over the past calendar year is 100% real. Nobody has the balls to backtrack and go "hold on, WHAT did you just say" during the meetings but the info has been confirmed as legit.</p>
<p>Lastly, the whole defund the police movement is starting to piss people off internally. 7 out of 10 calls to police are mental health related. Law enforcement has specifically requested more training to adequately deal with these individuals but are now being stonewalled and told this training is no longer in the budget.</p>
<p>Everything is a fucking sham. TLDR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vaccines won't make the Covid measures go away</li>
<li>Professionals are shocked by the low level of compliance for vaccine.</li>
<li>There are more drug overdoses than covid deaths in at least one major region and nobody is willing to point out how insane this is, but the info has been confirmed.</li>
<li>Defund the police is pissing people off.</li>
</ul></p>

        <p>It would be absolutely ridiculous to continue with masks/lockdowns after everyone who wants a vaccine has gotten one.   Who would we be trying to protect?  Anyone who refused the vaccine has made their choice and is clearly willing to incur the risk.  Everyone who has the vaccine is protected.   So why the fuck would we continue with restrictions?</p>
<p>That being said, I won't be the least bit surprised if it happens that way.</p>

        <p>This made me think. We were told by the company that they are aiming for 80% compliance and encourage us to send them our vaccine proof. Wouldn't that be nice if 80% compliance got rid of the masks. Guess I'll have to wait and find out.</p>

        <p>50% of the nation do NOT trust this gene therapy. It is not a vaccine. It never was a vaccine. It never will be a vaccine.</p>
<p>People who are educated on the numerous problems with gene therapies like myself, including ones which WHOLESALE killed animals in the things with sometimes EBOLA-LIKE hemorrhagic symptoms, are not going to get this gene therapy.</p>
