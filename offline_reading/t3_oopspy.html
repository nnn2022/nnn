    <strong>Very crazy idea: Make them pay.</strong>
    <p><p>I had this crazy idea.</p>
<p>As we all know, governments and Big Pharma manufacturers cannot be held legally liable for whatever adverse reaction that may arise from the experimental, unapproved jabs.</p>
<p>But let's say we change our targets.</p>
<p>Instead, we target those MSM talking heads, cybertroopers, local little Napoleons and anyone else who are calling for vaccine mandates. </p>
<p>Or at least those who launch 24/7 media campaigns for mass vaccination. But specifically target those who openly call for mandatory vaccination.</p>
<p>If anyone suffers serious adverse reactions as a result of the jab that they've been told 24/7 to take, consider serving legal notices to such clowns.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for them to demonstrate their faith. Let them show us that they really believe in "$¢i€n¢€".</p>
<p>I mean, there are people who are willing to even die for what they believe in - it could be a religious belief, it could be a political ideology, it could be anything. But they don't have to die; we just want them to be willing to part with their wealth, just to show us they really believe in "$¢i€n¢€".</p>
<p>Make them put their money where their mouths are.</p></p>

        <p>I have started to consider forcing my employer and school to sign something accepting any and all liability  for the shot if they are going to force me to take it. If it is safe they shouldn’t be worried about putting their money where their mouth is. If they refuse to they are admitting they don’t know it is safe and can go fuck themselves.</p>
