    <strong>I’m really disappointed in our teachers right now.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m so glad I found this sub. I’m the mother of two eight year old boys and most of my frustrations right now are directed at our schools and teachers. I just really need to vent about this.</p>
<p>My boys are in the third grade. The technical issues of online school is frustrating enough, but the teachers are another animal. I’ve been with my boys while they’re on the Zoom calls. My kids have three teachers they have calls with on the days there are calls. As of now they have Zoom calls three days a week. God bless one of their teachers, she’s probably around my age (I’m 28) and she’s a sweetheart and she’s trying as hard as she can to actually help these poor kids. I’ve been in the room while my kids are on call and she genuinely makes an effort to teach. I made sure to write her an email and thank her for trying to be a good teacher. </p>
<p>The other two teachers are older and they are not pleasant. They half ass everything and give too many assignments because they don’t feel like teaching. I’m good friends with the mom of one of my kid’s friends and we were at their house for dinner the other day. She said the teachers I’m talking about are in a teacher’s Facebook group where they just jerk each other off about how good of teachers they are and how they’re great people for wanting distance learning. She was kind of drunk so I don’t know if that’s completely true. I’m not a big Facebook user so I never saw it but that pisses me off. </p>
<p>I’ve been wanting to pull my kids out of school but I have to wait until the semester ends so their grades don’t get fucked up. I don’t know if I will, but if I do I’ll be homeschooling them. I’m pregnant with our third kid right now so I’ll need to quit my job soon anyways. When my first two were little I stayed home until they started elementary school. God, I am just so frustrated.</p></p>
