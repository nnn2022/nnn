    <strong>Contacting the Prime Minister</strong>
    <p><p>Almost every day for the last nearly two weeks I’ve been sending emails to the Prime Minister’s office with a simple message using this link: https://email.number10.gov.uk/</p>
<p>Subject: Who Are You?</p>
<p>Text Body: Clown, Puppet or Leader?</p>
<p>No threats, no insults, just an offering of introspection. Its not much but I encourage anyone else to join in, though we already suspect two of those answers are overwhelmingly more likely than the third.</p>
<p>You get a message in the confirmation link about the office receiving a high number of emails blah blah blah but maybe if enough people contribute it becomes a question that cannot be ignored.</p></p>

        <p>He's a Tory, and he's acting like one: that's just the old normal, not a new one. The painting of 'Boris' as 'populist' -implied to mean actually giving a damn about the people- is just more of Johnson's propaganda, he's always been a shameless opportunist, and prepared to act riskily and short-termist in the hope of getting what he wants, which, as normal, is simply more power and money.</p>

        <p>Do you think we’d be better off under Labour? Granted the media was largely against them which is potentially a good sign but politicians gonna politician.</p>

        <p>Nah, but they're just red Tories, or even Dems, these days. They're listening only to a tiny bubble of exactly the kind of privileged London -or American- middle class who aren't being negatively impacted much by lockdowns. Under real Labour I think we would be - if nothing else they were a heck of a lot brighter than the current sorry lot of politicians, they had to be more prepared to lead because they were aiming to change more, and there was more real political debate back then instead of repetitive soundbites.</p>
