    <strong>Freedom is Slavery. War is Peace. Ignorance is Strength. Real Life 1984.</strong>
    <p><p>Let's see what Spark Notes has to say about this slogan, adding in some commentary for our current situation.</p>
<p>&rt;These words are the official slogans of the Party, and are inscribed in massive letters on the white pyramid of the Ministry of Truth, as Winston observes in Book One, Chapter I. Because it is introduced so early in the novel, this creed serves as the reader’s first introduction to the idea of doublethink.  </p>
<p>Ah, yes, our old friend doublethink. How many examples of it have we seen in the past year?</p>
<p>&rt;By weakening the independence and strength of individuals’ minds and forcing them to live in a constant state of propaganda-induced fear, the Party is able to force its subjects to accept anything it decrees, even if it is entirely illogical </p>
<p>Project Mockingbird media outlets pushing variant fears? Just wait until the booster shots are rolled out in the fall.</p>
<p>&rt;for instance, the Ministry of Peace is in charge of waging war, the Ministry of Love is in charge of political torture, and the Ministry of Truth is in charge of doctoring history books to reflect the Party’s ideology. </p>
<p>Now the real-life Ministry of Truth will be hijacking your text messages to ensure you don't question the party's ideas. Oh, and the Ministry of "Science" that ignores any and all side effects due to their faulty vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt;That the national slogan of Oceania is equally contradictory is an important testament to the power of the Party’s mass campaign of psychological control. </p>
<p>"Safe and effective" is the new slogan of the party, even though the vaccine is neither safe (VAERS reports) nor effective (the rising cases, well, everywhere).</p>
<p>&rt;In theory, the Party is able to maintain that “War Is Peace” because having a common enemy keeps the people of Oceania united. </p>
<p>Sadly, we are the common enemy that keeps people united in their rather stupid goal of vaccine immunity, not herd immunity.</p>
<p>&rt;“Freedom Is Slavery” because, according to the Party, the man who is independent is doomed to fail. </p>
<p>If you leave your house, you're going to catch COVID and kill grandma! If you don't get vaccinated, you're putting everyone at risk! (Even though asymptomatic transmission is a farce and natural immunity is proving more robust)</p>
<p>&rt;By the same token, “Slavery Is Freedom,” because the man subjected to the collective will is free from danger and want. </p>
<p>If we all get vaccinated you can get your life back! Even though we're going to force you to wear masks again and lock you down!</p>
<p>&rt;“Ignorance Is Strength” because the inability of the people to recognize these contradictions cements the power of the authoritarian regime. </p>
<p>Trust the scientists! Trust the government! Don't question a rushed vaccine, flawed policies, and our blatant disregard of any established science!</p>
<p>We are living in a real life 1984, an if you can't see the similarities, you are too far gone. Don't let the other side gaslight you into saying "you probably haven't read 1984," or, "that's not what the book is about." I can ensure you that the book is exactly as we know it, and we're living the real life 1984 right now.</p>

        <p>Ive been toying with the idea of creating a "Winston speaking or Orwell here" account where I go around and comment with direct quotes from the book in direct relation to what's being posted or commented.  But procrastination has kept me idle.</p>

        <p>I recently read Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. At the very end of my copy of the book, there were a few interviews/analysis excerpts. The very last piece was a letter from Huxley to Orwell, in which Huxley gave his opinion (upon Orwell's request) on 1984. Aldous, rather than critiquing or even commenting on the writing or story, decided to posit his thoughts on the comparison between 1984 and Brave New World. In his letter, he proceeded to explain that he thought 1984 could be a very logical, natural precedent to Brave New World, and he described how the world of 1984 could smoothly transition into that of BNW.</p>
<p>Just food for thought.</p>
