        <p>That’s the point - poorer people will need government to survive, and then once enough of society is dependent on the government, they can control the masses. </p>
<p>Many keep saying it - it’s never been about a virus. The government is not suddenly a benevolent entity that wants to “save lives” of its most geriatric citizens (58% of deaths are over 75; 80% over 65, per the CDC). The government (and MSM that is funded by it) puts fear into the masses and then establishes “emergency measures” to have more control on society (surveillance, forced isolation, dehumanization with masks), but the biggest problem is they’ve set precedent, and they will continue to do this whenever they want to ensure the masses cannot do things like...assemble with like-minded people... enjoy time with their families... or even go into society to see how scary it <strong><em>REALLY ISN’T</em></strong>. </p>
<p>But yeah - I’m the asshole for not strapping a piece of polyester across my face that has widely been considered as ineffective for <strong><em>decades</em></strong>.</p>
