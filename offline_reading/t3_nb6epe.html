    <strong>Some of you are a little kookey..</strong>
    <p><p>But yet I still come here to get a sense of normalcy. It’s insane how much I get bombarded with nonsense and god forbid you don’t agree with them because it automatically becomes a burn the heretic situation.  As for that ban this subreddit subreddit, talk about clown town. How do you not have anything better to do than that?  If I hear something I don’t like I turn it off and refuse to lend my ear to that nonsense . How ridiculous is it to wah wah wah all day about nothing? Oh and then claim superiority because you read a headline? No you did not read an article about it. You know it. We know it.  Oh but “you’re not a doctor!” Neither are you Karen so shut the fuck up. 
Never has your google searches been skewed to show you what you might like instead. You totally read 5 articles a day to be on top of it! You’re a total hero for doing your part we applaud you for being the test! Maybe you can put your voter sticker on vax card that’s like some hero level over 9000 shit right there! Next time they honor heroes make sure you stand up and take a vow!</p>
<p>Like I said some of you guys get a little off the rails but common sense knows when we’ve derailed. Even with that you guys are still the more sane of the bunch . The hatred in that other subreddit is a testament of the pile of hypocritical Sunday Catholics they have become. Thanks for not being like them</p></p>

        <p>Yeah. There are some imo really bad/weird takes here, not many but some, but at least we can all civilly talk about what's going on.</p>
<p>You try asking anywhere else if people think the government overreached even a little, and you're apparently outing yourself as a neo-nazi white supremacist or something. World has gone mad.</p>

        <p>The approach they’ve chose to take is shame people. I don’t think they got the memo that berating people does not make them change their mind, on the contrary they double down. If you come at me aggressively I already tuned you out and could care less about the air escaping your lips.
  The point you made is a totally reasonable point to bring up . You should be questioning what your government is doing always. But I guess the propaganda machine worked again and got people immediately tuning out and rabid at the words conspiracy.</p>

        <p>I can have conversations with people who disagree with me, I feel that they can't do the same. The vast majority of the time they resort to calling people who disagree with them idiots or morons or anti-vaxxers or selfish Etc. At that point the conversation is over for me. I'm simply not going to speak with you if you can't be civil and use your words.</p>
