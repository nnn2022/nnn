    <strong>Misappropriating by Doomers</strong>
    <p><p>Isn't it funny how they misappropriate things like the term Karen, or George Carlin's quote about how smart the average person is? How are we so divided on such a dumb thing?</p></p>

        <p>Because too many people were programmed as children to believe that "the man" is out to get them, and that the odds are insurmountable. When people get older they make assumptions about (or are told by a politician, media personality, or influencer) who "the man" is and fight the now named threat. People have been programmed to hate someone... anyone... that "threatens" them. 
This is the result of the progressive education system (preschool through college). Its dangerous. Somehow some people escape the programming, likely by being different or not caring or being taught by their parents or another good role model. Now we have to try to show these scared people that we aren't "the man" and that we're not really trying to kill them, even as they threaten to kill us in what they see as "self defense".</p>
