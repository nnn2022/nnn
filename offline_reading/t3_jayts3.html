    <strong>i have a prediction</strong>
    <p><p>Once the Doomers flip and wake up to the truth.</p>
<p>They will be the ones that go violent/most extreme against the officials that locked everything down.</p>
<p>Those of us that smelled the bullshit from a mile away, while damaged and disenfranchised by all this shit are not surprised it's all been a lie , but these hook line and sinker fools are going to be emotionally wrecked i think and i don't know what the reaction will be.</p></p>

        <p>My job doesn't require a college degree. Out of 10 guys only one has went to college and he's by far the dumbest of the team. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you this, one time at lunch he spent over a minute trying to open a bag of chips until I got frustrated and snatched the bag out of his hands and opened it for him</p>
<p>Another time he was about to touch a a shaft that was spinning at a couple thousand RPM until I yelled at him not to touch it because I didn't feel like watching him die in front of me</p>
<p>Many other examples. I can go on for days</p>

        <p>Problem is that they are not really "street smart" (horrible word but I mean experience)  they do not consider people might lie to them, cheat them or that common held notions are wrong.</p>
<p>Because of their academia bubble they do not distrust a lot. Which is good for sanity but not for searching truth.</p>
<p>College students are quite naive and some hardly lose it ever.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they are not the ones getting fucked often. It is the poor people. </p>
<p>Also blue collar workers often experience more real world shit.</p>
<p>They do not spend time within the safe weird bubble of campus culture.</p>
<p>Academics is searching for truth and building within frameworks.</p>
<p>Take a look at people from less well off countries for example.</p>
<p>They know their government can fuck them and a lot of them have experienced it.</p>

        <p>This. I just graduated and it is a great thing.</p>
<p>But it does not teach you real critical thinking skills WITHOUT using a predefined or chosen framework.</p>
<p>You receive a framework and you apply reason within it.</p>
<p>You do not usually consider all of the pre existing notions are wrong.</p>
<p>If you do you are Einstein and 80% of academics will paint you as a loon still. Einstein was mocked.</p>
<p>The professors do experience more as they are actively researching stuff more and being more independent in thought.</p>
<p>They create frameworks.</p>

<p>"Here's what critical thinkers think, think this",  that's the extent of critical thought at universities today. Unless you had a very exceptional professor somewhere along the line, you didn't learn any critical thinking at all.  Obviously, you picked up a little of it on your own!  Good job.</p>

        <p>I think you'll have a few groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those that simply can't let go of this "new normal" ever - they're going to be a huge group, constant exposure to propaganda was proven by the soviets to be mind-altering, some of these idiots are going to be sucking their thumbs at home and weeping when you remove their masks, forever.</li>
<li>Those that pretend they always hated masks, etc. there are going to be a few of these, they're going to be mainly younger people with social media presences to worry about</li>
<li>Those that cannot come to terms with what they have done and take it out on themselves - sadly, this is going to be a big group, and suicides and self-harm will skyrocket if these people ever come into contact with reality. They are the guards at Auschwitz. They knew, deep down, they were wrong but instead of speaking up, they stayed silent.</li>
<li>Those that cannot come to terms with what they've done and want to blame others. Yes, a big angry mob turns into a smaller but angrier mob. No surprises there, Western society thrives on mob rule now. Democracy is dead. Angry children is the way things work now.</li>
<li>A very small group that is genuinely contrite and works to build bridges with those they alienated.</li>
<li>Another very small group that will switch political affiliation permanently when they realize there was more politics than pestilence in this "plague".</li>

        <p>For the good of humanity, I hope you’re right. </p>
<p>But realistically, I expect you to be wrong. Prepare for a lot of “based on what we knew at the time we absolutely made the right decision even though it turned out badly.” </p>
<p>The best thing we can do is not let anyone who makes that argument get away with it - we absolutely did know at the time, here’s the proof, and those harms are on YOU. They’ll never admit guilt, but maybe <em>some</em> of them will actually bother to think next time.</p>

        <p>I don't know. I dont think they'll see it as they were tricked. Imo they'll see it as "Orange Man didn't do enough in the beginning to stop Big Rona so i lost everything." These people are constantly being fed half truths and distortions all day by msnbc. I know people who watch cnn, msnbc,etc from 8am to 10pm more or less. Sure, fox news distorts, too, but libs went plain fckin nuts with Big Rona stuff.</p>

        <p>💯. I’m coming back from visiting my dad and I had to keep asking them to turn off CNN. There’s a bar on the screen that lists the # of worldwide cases and deaths, and then the same for the US. No wonder they’re afraid</p>

        <p>Yeah I hope you are right but they have caused me to lose any little faith in humanity I may have had.  My local community has had ZERO resident COVID deaths.  2 deaths from non-resident old folks Cuomo shipped over here on their last breaths.  I shared a link to the county health records to the local sub and it was removed for misinformation.  I think this COVID fantasy, for the doomers at least is going to be like christianity - obviously any sane person knows Christianity is a scam , but they just believe in religiously for centuries in spite of evidence.  I think the doomers won this round, and until society collapses they will have their heyday</p>

        <p>I wish. I’m not as optimistic though. People generally don’t want to admit that they were wrong. That’s why it’s so hard to wake up sheep. They want to protect their paradigm at all cost to protect their ego. That’s the foundation of brainwashing. Their truths are built up layer by layer. Short of the government coming out and saying “it was all a lie”, which will never happen, these people will quantify all the info in their mind in a way to maintain their paradigm. Just another dividing line for the population. Those of us that live in fear of viruses and those of us that don’t. It’s the age old strategy, make people who buy into your propaganda feel smart for doing so. “Anti-vaxxers are stupid because they don’t believe science so pro-vaxxers are smart”. Anti-virus are stupid and pro-virus are smart. Falls back on the whole “in order to tell a lie that big there would have to be so many countries/governments/people in on it that it’s impossible, couldn’t happen”. That idea will not go away. I don’t see a way out for these people unfortunately. The ones that are curious and go down the rabbit hole will turn around but I still feel like they will be in the minority with us. But to me, that’s what it takes. Someone has to literally re-educate themselves on everything they think they know to see what has really happened here and I’m just doubtful our lazy society will have enough of a critical mass of people that actually do that to have any sort of mass revolt.</p>

        <p>By design. I boil it down to lazyness. For me, if it doesn’t make sense, I’m going to put the effort into figuring out why. I wish that didn’t make me unique but unfortunately it does. If it requires effort, people just want to “trust the experts”.  It’s painful to watch but that’s is probably by design too.  It’s like the path is illuminated for those that seek it. If you aren’t willing to put the effort in, your just a hamster on a wheel with a soul begging to grow.</p>

        <p>Could be how / who raised you. The people who raised me pushed to always question things, always subject every idea to interrogation, always approach subjects from multiple angles and gather as much information as possible in order to form a solid position. I thought this was normal, that EVERYONE did this. I remember the moment in life when I realized most people (especially in my age group) aren’t curious about things, don’t even know how to question the “standard” worldview, or just plain don’t care. It was kind of astonishing. It is intellectual laziness, and sadly it is extremely commonplace.</p>

        <p>Product of their environment.  </p>
<p>Not just parents/people that raised you but the school system also teaches you to “play it safe, trust the experts, don’t think - memorize what we tell you. Get a job, work hard, and your government will take care of you. </p>
<p>I can’t disagree that your environment plays a huge role. But I gotta feel like life is constantly trying to wake people up. It’s why we are here. Learn, grow, understand. We’re fed this narrative of either a God coming to save us or this life is all there is so lie, cheat, steal, do whatever you got to do to make this one chance the best possible. Or, just trust that God is coming to save you. </p>
<p>Problem is,  if you are paying attention, those things don’t really add up. </p>
<p>We all have a heart and a soul trying to guide us.  When you play video games 40 hours a week, you don’t feel good. You don’t feel accomplished. You know it was a big waste in your heart. But people still do it. </p>
<p>When you masterbate you don’t feel good about it. You don’t feel that it’s pure. You don’t feel that your creator put you here to have artificial sex with yourself to someone that sacrificed their morals to make some money. Your heart and soul tell you that’s not what you are here for.   Or, you’ve just gotten really good at quieting the noise so you can run amuck with no conscience. </p>
<p>As much as I’d love to give them an out and say something outside of themselves failed them, I can’t. It’s their responsibility. And if they don’t learn in this life, they will start over again, and again, and again.  I am writing this because I know in my heart I have a moral obligation to share what I have learned. We are all in this together. We all create together. I could just meditate for the rest of my life and ignore all the people that are out there to distract me from only focusing on myself but I don’t believe that’s what I’m here for. If we are all co-creators in this reality, I have a moral obligation to elevate my fellow man. Sometimes I want to leave them for the wolves but my heart tells me otherwise.  The one thing I hate most in life is to see others suffer. There is a reason that’s what strikes my core harder than anything else. That is the battle. That’s where I’m meant to serve.</p>

        <p>Makes me think of Nazi Germany in the last days. They were in denial until it was utterly destroyed. Hitler knew they were going to lose after Stalingrad but they kept living out their fantasy as long as possible. I’m skeptical these people will ever wake up. The issue is complicated enough they can come up with excuses. Maybe after enough time has past that people aren’t emotionally invested in it.</p>

        <p>Good comparison. Reminds me of when I see someone outside doing chores with a mask on. They are at home. No one around. But they have to have their mask on. They are so committed that they feel their mask is protecting them at all times. It’s what “ the experts” told them to do so they are gonna do the sh*t out of it. They are smart. They are dedicated. They are good little soldiers following orders. They play it safe. Life will take care of them because they played it safe. There is a deadly germ out there just waiting for them to slip up so they must live their life vigilant. No mistakes. Sanitize everything. Bleach their hands after exposing them to unsanitary conditions. Have tinder sex with a mask on. Always vigilant. They are so committed to the experts that they will never suspect that the germ could be injected into them by those same experts. If a cough comes on, get tested, quarantine, test again. If later on another cough comes on, same routine, reinfections happen, the news told me so. The virus will never go away. This is the new normal. My government will take care of me if I do as I’m told. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, your government is charged with crimes against humanity and you are going down with them because you were complicit and not being able to “think for your self but just following orders” is not a viable defense in the court of law. </p>
<p>Hurts my heart to see people being taken advantage of but it all boils down to effort. If you are too lazy to do your own research and think for yourself, what do you deserve other than to be taken advantage of?</p>
