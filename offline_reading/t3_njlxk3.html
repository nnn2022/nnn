    <strong>Less hesitant because of lab leak hypothesis</strong>
    <p><p>For those of you who believe the lab leak hypothesis, does that change your outlook on getting the vaccine?</p>
<p>For me, I'd rather take my chances with a natural coronavirus than a barely test vaccine.</p>
<p>However, if the coronavirus was engineered in a lab (possibly to create some long-term damage) I'd rather take the vaccine they came up with to prevent it.</p>
<p>Do you see a flaw in this logic?</p></p>

        <p>Why trust them on the vaccine though? Besides, it's obvious even if it's lab engineered it's not very deadly, so why poison yourself for no reason?</p>

        <p>The only thing I'm worried about is potential long term effects. For example, some strains of HPV are known to cause cancer, so being immunized from HPV might make sense. Same goes for this.</p>

        <p>I don't trust anyone in the public eye. One of the possibilities I thought of was that there's some serious long term consequences of covid they're not telling us about because then they'd have to own up to the lab leak.</p>
<p>I think powerful people lie but I don't think they're intentionally malicious. They do it to cover their asses or protect their interests. I'm trying to think through what those might realistically be.</p>

        <p>The question you need to ask yourself is this: Is the cure worse than the disease? We are starting to see some evidence that it might be. If you are under the age of 70 and healthy, statistically speaking, you'll be fine. As for the vaccine, we could be seeing teenagers developing blood clots and nearly dying, and it may be because of the vaccine. We simply don't know enough yet to make an educated decision either way. My advice, if you're relatively young and healthy, would be to not get the shot. I think it's riskier than catching Covid.</p>

        <p>I'm with you there. My issue is with potential long-term negative effects. For example, we know some strains of HPV can cause cancer in women. For that reason I think it makes sense for women who are sexually active to get their Gardasil (if they choose).</p>
<p>I'm not scared of catching covid and dying at all. I'm more worried that there could be some long-term issues with it, because people are saying it can cause vascular damage and etc. although the medical science is way beyond me, and I don't know if they're just saying that to get people sufficiently scared. And then at the same time, I'm also worried about potential long-term issues with the vaccine.</p>
<p>However, if research scientists were specifically engineering this virus to cause long-term damage way later, I'd rather take their stupid vaccine against it. You get what I'm saying?</p>

<p>Neither are known.
There is a potential meteor speeding through space that can end you existence.  Should you start digging a shelter?</p>
<p>The long term effects are not know for either but what is known is that it is rare for any COVID-19 survivors to suffer any effects at all after recovery.  It also known what demographics are at risk.  For everyone else... &rt;98% of the population... live healthy and trust your immune system and you'll be fine.</p>

        <p>I thought it was engineered last year after zerohedge published dr YAN's first few papers.</p>
<p>The body is still the one killing the virus. The mrna bit artificially provokes the immune system but it's still the immune system doing the work.</p>
<p>No mrna vaccine for me. And i believe it was an engineered bioweapon. The leak was cover. In terms of damage it was very effective.</p>

        <p>sure, i guess i'm more apprehensive of something engineered, not so much because some humans are evil geniuses, but because we think we're geniuses when really we're dumb as hell. humanity's god complex is our downfall so often. the same could be said for new vaccine technology... so it would probably be a coin flip either way for me.</p>

        <p>Things that have been engineered or domesticated by humans tend to lose some of their special features after they go wild and have naturalistic evolutionary forces working on them.  Covid has been out of its lab for over a year.</p>

        <p>THEY ADDED HIV SEQUENCES FOR BINDING TO ACE 2 TO MAKE IT TRANSMISSIBLE AMONGST HUMANS. </p>
<p>HELLO.</p>
<p>The vaccine has almost nothing to do with the lab made virus. Even the spike protein sequences of the vaccine have two prolines inserted to increase binding affinity.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry but this is not how it works.</p>
<p>Pseudotyped HIV-1 virus vectors are a very reliable and effective way to determine whether or not antibody constructs can neutralize virus effectively. This is method is used for research and clinical trial analytics. </p>
<p>Pseudotyped HIV-1 can infect cells however it cannot replicate and levels degrade over time as the host cells die.</p>
