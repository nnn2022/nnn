    <strong>I can't hear what my teachers are saying.</strong>
    <p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I can't hear what my teachers are saying because of masks. Microphones doesn't help.</p>
<p>I can't hear what my teachers are saying when they wears masks. The pandemic has learned me that I relies a lot more on facial expressions and body language to understand what's being said than I first thought. I'm not deaf, but I've autism. I combine the sounds and the body language to pick up words.</p>
<p>I'm studying language in college currently. My teachers mumbles, have only microphones that doesn't work and they doesn't have masks with windows on. After school reopened I hoped we could go back to normal and that my education wouldn't be affected by the pandemic. Although masks aren't mandatory to wear in school by law, some teachers still insists on wearing them for their own and their family's safety. They've been wearing them the whole semester. It makes it more difficult for me and other students in my class. Especially when we're trying to learn a new language.</p>
<p>There's some part time students in my class who are completely deaf. Sometimes they've sign language interpreters in class and they don't wear masks. There have been times I've not been able to understand my teachers at all, so I use power points combined with looking at someone else's interpreter to understand what's being said. I don't know sign language very well. I can only a few hundred words, so I can pick a few words here and there. When teachers who speaks either my 1st or 2nd language can't be understood, and I've to rely on my 3rd language - it says a lot. My teachers doesn't sign when the interpreter isn't there although they knows there's a few in the class that knows some. I'm frustrated. I'm angry. I'm tired of this.</p>
<p>I don't want this to be my new normal. I may sound selfish and Karen now to some pro maskers, but right now I needs interpreter too as a hearing person. No, I don't wear masks in class. I only use them on public transportation to avoid getting in trouble.</p>
<p>PS! I'm not sure if this post belongs under "mask" or "rant" flair.</p></p>

        <p>I saw my friend's son have his speech therapy at school through zoom. His regular teacher wears amask, bc she is also teaching an in-room class. But then his speech therapist signs on - I'm not sure if she was even at the school - in her mask. How does a masked speech therapist, do speech therapy? Like really how is this even legal? Is it just that no one is complaining? The special needs kids might as well just unplug and go play outdoors.</p>

        <p>Girlfriend is a speech path and has been dealing with this issue. Some clients she wears a face shield, others nothing depending on what the parents are ok with. Luckily many are over the masks and are ok with not using them. None of the kids wear masks because if they did the whole thing would just be a big waste of time and money.</p>
<p>She was able to to teletherapy rather effectively, but not as effectively as meeting in person. We are both young and have an easy time with technology. I am also a nerd who dabbles in things like livestreaming, and a long time wfh employee, so I was able to help set her up with nice equipment and share knowledge of what works well in these kind of situations. I doubt many therapists are in a situation like that, meaning many kids have been receiving subpar treatment.</p>

        <p>Good point! I don't get it either how that's legal. Before COVID19 the place I lived in was super disability friendly, accommodated if necessary, we got the medical attention we needed and people treated us with respect. Many could live like ablebodied people and we had equality. There wasn't big difference between us and it was okay to be different.</p>
<p>Nowadays it changed. People with disabilities are seen as a burden to society, the waiting lists for medical attention is longer, people are less likely to accommodate in fear of the virus and people gets mad if we're not following the rules. The virus changed our society. People gets afraid. People doesn't want to stay too close or show their faces anymore. So, pen-paper communication, normal face-to-face communication and so on doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>Before COVID19 almost everyone had equally access to information and education, but nowadays it's just a privilege. Not a right anymore. Even in the most equal and wealthiest countries in the world the gap has widen. Some cities in my country have changed policies and made masks mandatory by law in some places. Luckily my city hasn't gone so far. Yes, you would be looked down upon for not wearing one. But not fined.</p>

        <p>Come to think of it that is another aspect that is so hypocritical.  A lot of the younger peeps have made a big show of trying to be inclusive and pouncing all over any perceived hint of anything else but now the minute you don't wear a mask for ANY reason, no matter how valid, suddenly it's OK to suggest that person should never leave their house ever?</p>

        <p>True. Many leftists are calling right wings for racists, ableist, sexist and discriminatory for being disagree with them on political issues. They complains welfare is bad, we're not disabled friendly etc. But after the coronavirus the idea of disability friendliness went out of the window and the same people are criticizing disabled for not masking.</p>
<p>As a left wing myself I think many of these so called "including youth" are going too far and aren't good at including anymore. They changed overnight thanks to a silly virus and some treats it like the pest, Ebola etc. Yes, coronavirus is real. Yes, it spreads. But it's not an excuse to discriminate. Wear you mask if you like to, but don't push it on everyone else and don't normalize it for commoners. Don't refuse minorities to speak their native language. Some languages like sign language needs lip movement.</p>

        <p>You know I was fine with the PC thing when it was just about trying to be respectful of others, but somehow it got hijacked to justify attacking and humiliating others for minor innocent unintentional slips in a 'new speech' language that just got invented, not sure how the pendulum swung that far.  Some dude who dressed as Michael Jackson in the 1980s because he loved Michael Jackson is not a racist, that's just way beyond reasonable, it's like the whole world is losing its mind and so many things have been turned backwards on themselves in ways that are neither logical nor fair.</p>

        <p>Why don’t they use face shields? I’ll admit it still makes the sound a little weird for me but my college doesn’t have masks in classrooms. Only staff wear shields</p>

        <p>Yeah, at my college we aren’t allowed to wear face shields because they “don’t cover your mouth and nose” and must wear masks. But I can wear a mesh mask no problem. The more inconvenient, the better to virtue signal with, it seems.</p>

        <p>Yeah at one restaurant I go to, they wear both a mask and a face shield and it makes some of them sound like Chinese accented female darth vaders.  I sometimes chat with the manager, they are not doing it because of fear of covid, just fear of Karens but the end result is they may as well mime everything because I can barely understand them.</p>
