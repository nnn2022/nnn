&rt;UN enlists 10,000 digital volunteers to fight COVID-19 misinformation
&rt;
&rt;In May, the U.N. placed an open call for volunteer digital-first responders, and has since enlisted the support of more than 10,000 people, who receive daily emails about actions they can take to counter misinformation on their own social media platforms. The volunteers include fact-checkers in Colombia and journalists in the U.K., and the number of supporters is growing at a rate of 10% per week, according to &rt;the U.N.</p>

        <p>I never said anything about the common cold. And your math is wrong. The estimated deaths would be 3% of 1% of 7.8 billion. And on top of that, lockdowns and masks won’t do anything to save those lives. The measures taken clearly aren’t working now.</p>

<li>What measures? The US is barely even in lockdown right now. Example: Halifax is doing really well because they are taking the virus VERY seriously (lockdown, mandatory masks, LEGALLY REQUIRED 14 day quarantining)</li>

        <p>I can only speak for my area, but plenty of measures were taken. Restaurants and malls were closed, grocery stores had strictly limited capacity, and I didn’t go into work for two months (though I was lucky enough to get paid anyway). Despite all that, the case numbers still increased. The point is this pandemic isn’t going to last forever. What will last is the economic damage done by the lockdowns. A lot of businesses in my area never opened back up after the restrictions were lifted. They lost their livelihoods for nothing because the virus is still here and isn’t going anywhere until an effective vaccine is widely distributed.</p>

        <p>Watch my video on face mask and learn why. At the beginning of all this they were telling us NOT to wear them, that it doesn’t help and they collect germs and bacteria that we breathe back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-o7jceedEw">https://youtu.be/Q-o7jceedEw</a><br>
Then they did a complete 180 and literally force them upon us. They keep pushing and forcing restrictions and  don’t even follow them themselves. <br>
Obama’s  just enjoyed a nice December Christmas vacation in Hawaii canoeing, surfing, enjoying the beach and playing golf, not wearing mask nor caring. <br>
Governor Newsom told people to stay home for thanksgiving and not to gather. Yet he was caught out eating inside a diner with numerous people. None wearing mask nor social distancing. <br>
This is going on worldwide, the politician and government staff force restrictions and then never follow them. They are out enjoying life, going on vacations and living normal while they laugh at us. Now doesn’t that make you question things? If there was truly a virus, these turds would be scared to death and in their bunkers.</p>

        <p>I generally don’t have a problem with masks. I don’t think they do anything, but businesses have the right to require them, so I’ll respect that while I’m inside them. However, I won’t wear them outdoors. As for the vaccine, I don’t trust it because it’s clearly been rushed through development and we don’t know what the side effects might be. </p>
<p>What I do have a problem with are all the restrictions and lockdowns. They aren’t working to stop the spread and all they’re doing is killing small businesses and ruining people’s finances. And telling people they aren’t allowed to gather with their friends and family is absolutely draconian and unacceptable to me. </p>
<p>In the beginning, I was worried about the pandemic. I was on board with social distancing and staying home. But the longer it went with nothing improving, I realized it wasn’t worth it. Very few people I know have gotten it, and the ones who did (minus an elderly man with pre-existing conditions) have gotten over it with no issues. I’ve been hanging out with my friends for months now and nothing has happened to any of us. There just isn’t enough reason for me to worry anymore.</p>

        <p>Because if this virus was even half as bad as they claim then we wouldn’t be wearing masks while walking through huge chain stores of 1,000+ people while mom &amp; pop stores are manhandled. If this virus was so terrifying and horrific then medical professionals wouldn’t be posting TikToks of them dancing in Rona wards where people are dying (allegedly). These are just 2 of my top 50 reasons for why this is an absolute joke.</p>

        <p>Hello! I'm really hoping here that you're interested in understanding other opinions, and not a troll. If you'd like to discuss it, I would be more than happy to go over the various downsides to mass mask wearing.</p>
<p>To briefly summarize the main points - There have been mass mandates on wearing something, anything over your face, with no emphasis on cleaning or sanitizing it. The whole 'never touch it' fell to the wayside long ago, meaning the vast majority of masks are bacteria laden pieces of cloth with extended contact with your nose and mouth, and as such bacterial pneumonia and other adverse affects are on the rise. If you would like sources and more info, let me know.</p>
<p>In addition, the damage being done to children is horrifying. They NEED to see faces in their infancy to properly learn social cues and communication. We're  risking great harm to an entire generation for a negligible reward. The main mask study quoted used hamsters, and had no standing to be applied worldwide. Masks in a clinical hospital setting, changed hourly, vs the cotton mask you dug out of your purse are so far removed from each other it is absolutely insane, yet for some reason we are not allowed to discuss it. Again, I have sources for all of my claims and would be more than happy to provide them if you are interested in continuing the conversation.</p>

        <p>Masks are useless, a viral droplet is smaller than what a mask can filter and only an N95 mask can filter 95% of droplets and bacterial pneumonia is a thing... So yeah, no thanks</p>

        <p>&rt; Why all the complaints about wearing masks?</p>
<p>My body, my choice.</p>
<p>&rt; why all this backlash on the vaccine? </p>
<ul>
<li>It was rushed to market</li>
<li>The type of vaccine (mRNA) has never been licensed for use in the US by the FDA before.  This is literally the first time it's ever been used in people en masse.  And it was rushed to market.</li>
<li>The companies releasing the vaccines would only do so if they were absolved of liability for anything that might go wrong with the vaccines</li>
<li>Did I mention it was rushed to market?</li>
<li>The death rate is far less than the media has led you and others to believe.</li>
<li>It has not gone through the same level of rigorous testing that most vaccines do and, in fact, has not been "approved" for use by the FDA, but rather it's allowed to be used under emergency authorization orders.</li>
<li>It's a rushed vaccine and why the fuck do I want to stick a rushed vaccine into my body?</li>

        <p>I am also nervous about the rushed vaccine. As for the reason you gave for not wearing a mask, if you were making a reference to abortions I REALLY hope you don’t think that having to have a kid you can’t take care of is as bad as wearing a mask. If you weren’t referencing abortions, wearing a mask barely affects you in any way.</p>
