    <strong>At least Australia has gun...oh wait</strong>
    <p><p>I fucking hate it here in Australia. Either I'm ignorant but everybody just takes whatever authoritarian BS the government gives with a smile on their face. "A mILiLiOn ZiLlIoN people dead from teh coronaa" my ass. Meanwhile my mother won't shut up about getting the vaccine which I keep trying to tell her is not a fucking good idea (she thinks nobody got the flu because they put something "real good" in the flu vaccines). It's getting to the point where it feels pointless to try and accomplish anything because we're going to be ruled by Xinnie by 2025. We started as a penal colony and if people don't stop being grateful inmates we'll end as one too.</p></p>

        <p>Start asking people if there was a global pandemic, the global death toll for 2020 would have been huge right? Then ask them to look up the number. With a larger total population in 2020 we had a lower deathtoll than 2017.</p>

        <p>Remember to point out that the "Baby Boomers", the largest generation ever fired from their mothers' wombs all at once are all hitting average life expectancy all at once, right now. The "baby boom" began 75 years ago. What is average life expectancy in the West again....?</p>
