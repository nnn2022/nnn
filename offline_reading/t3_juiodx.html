    <strong>Open up and issue a one time stimulus</strong>
    <p><p>I say open everything up.  Issue a one time stimulus to help people get going and to help those small “mom and pop” shop business after months of lockdowns and depression.  </p>
<p>Those on unemployment must find a job with in 4-8 weeks or they will be denied the stimulus.  Exemptions would be those who are legitimately sick, or are unable to work due to a disability.  They are excused but those who want to live in constant 24/7 fear will have to get a job.</p></p>

        <p>I say "Won't work!" We need to encourage people to stay home until we have a vaccine.</p>
<p>That means we need full 100% income replacements until the vaccine is out and not the Pfizer one that comes with extreme refrigeration (-80C) necessary to properly transport it.</p>
<p>You are just pushing ultra-conservative punitive nonsense here... it's not going to fly.</p>

        <p>&rt; We need to encourage people to stay home until we have a vaccine.</p>
<p>Except of course for truck drivers, power plant workers, farmers, water treatment plant workers, sewage plant workers, refrigeration industry workers, Pfizer workers, food processors, food distributors, doctors, nurses, their aides and assistants,  hospital supply workers, emt, police, loggers, grain operations, dock workers, shipping barge operators, ppe producers, government officials and politicians, news reporters, cameramen, protestors, scientists of course, actors, directors, film producers, delivery drivers, grocery workers, dispensary operators, pharmacists, residential care workers, in-home care workers, para-professionals, hospice, powerline repair people, trash collectors and sanitation crews, prison workers, internet service providers, cell service providers, IT support for all these industries, repair people for all these industries, plumbers, gas station workers, miners, petroleum engineers,  janitorial and custodial workers in all of these industries, people working in air travel to accommodate people in these industries, people working as assistants, receptionists, dry cleaners, chauffeurs, chefs, etc for the very-high level executives in all of these industries (you think Fauci is showing up in clothes that came out of the washing machine you’re crazy), there so many more. Of course all these people use pens and paper, garbage bags, lightbulbs, electrical cords, staplers, toilet paper, toothpaste, floss, soap, disinfectants, cleaning supplies, paper towels, personal care items like shampoo, soap, Qtips, razors, tampons, baby diapers, condoms, so those workers and plants and distributers need to be operational too. And there’s even more than that if you really stop to think about it!</p>
<p>How on earth do you quantify who <em>should</em> and <em>shouldnt</em> stay home? Do you really need electricity or could you use oil lamps? Do you really need meat or could you eat a vegetarian diet? Do you really need libraries or is literacy “non-essential”? </p>
<p>And you have the nerve to say others are pushing nonsense?</p>
<p>Yes let’s just encourage “people” to stay home! Why didn’t anyone ever think of that?!!</p>
