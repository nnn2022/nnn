        <p>There's this song from the 90's called "Everyone's free (to wear sunscreen)". It's a graduation song with a guy giving random bits of life advice. There's one line that I think about often. It's something like, "don't worry too much. The things most likely to affect you are things that never crossed your worried mind." I think this covid thing is a prime example of that. Yes, it's possible covid could kill you. But why worry about that when you are probably not worrying about the things with a higher probability of happening.</p>
<p>Here is the exact line:</p>
<p>Don't worry about the future
Or worry, but know that worrying
Is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing Bubble gum
The real troubles in your life
Are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind
The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday</p>
