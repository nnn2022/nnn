    <strong>An anecdote regarding "self-service social control"</strong>
    <p><p>Last Saturday I went for a nice, government-mandated walk with my girlfriend in a public park about 15 minutes from my house. On the way, we decided to stop in a relatively quiet corner shop (convenience store) to get a can of coke and some cigarettes etc. I'm quite friendly with the lady who works behind the counter so I thought it would be nice to say hi as well. So, we try to enter the shop and this big fat bloke outside barks at us that "THERE'S A QUEUE!". Odd, I think, as here in the UKÂ (at least where I live) it's only the bigger supermarkets that enforce such policies. I glance inside and I can only make out one other person in the shop, but shrug it off and we join the "queue".</p>
<p>Anyway, we duly queue behind fatty and he's talking on his phone to some other moron. He says something like "yeah, and only LOSERS leave the house when they don't need to" and gives me and my gf the side eye as he says it. This irks me but I hold my tongue. So the bloke in the shop goes in, buys his rustlers burgers and porno mags or whatever and comes out, and we go in. I walk up to the counter to say hi to the lady and realise halfway through the usual "so how are you keeping through all of this" that I've forgotten to put my mask on. I apologise and put it on and she says "oh OP, don't worry about that!". </p>
<p>As we leave I think to myself, it's pretty unlikely this shop has a "one in, one out" policy and that the lady who works there didn't even care I wasn't wearing my face diaper. So this means that fatty was just afraid of being in the shop with another human being, to the point where he took it upon himself to instantiate a queuing system. This is worrying. The doomers are at the point now where they are actively enforcing the government's arbitrary rules of their own accord. At the risk of drawing up the same old comparison to Nazi Germany, it's like the Hitler Jugend turning in their own friends and parents. This obsequious fuck is harming a small business and turning against his fellow man, either for his own self righteousness, blind fear, or both. I've started calling this alarming and insidious behaviour "self-service social control". I just wish I had called him out on it when I had the chance. Stay vigilant, friends.</p>
