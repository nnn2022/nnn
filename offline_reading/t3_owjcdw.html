        <p>The vaccinated are at risk. The corona virus becomes more infectuous, but less lethal. It is set to evolve into a common cold virus. The unvaxxed will catch it but, the inate immune system will take care of it. Yet for the vaccinated, the inate immune system is suppressed by the vaccine immunity, resulting in a flawed immune response needing revised booster shots, which is why Israel, and now the UK too, are now providing the 3d shot, if not vaccinated people will die from breakthrough infection. We're already seeing more viral titres in vaccine breakthrough cases from delta variant, indicating worse covid for vaccinated people. When revised booster shots are applied, new variants will be evading that new immunity again. It's a race against nature, that can't be won. With every round of revised booster shots, the inate immune system is supressed more, and that refill with spike protein will cause debilitating random organ inflammation and deadly thrombotic events on every round. Evetnually the vaccinated will be in a race to survive by getting booster shots against a disease, which will be nothing more than the common cold for those with a healthy immune system.</p>

        <p>Indeed. That's why even people that recovered from covid infection, having reached immunity with an immune response to all main viral proteins (S, N, M and E) and with which less than 1% of reinfection has been seen, because the broader immune response is also triggered in case of mutated variants, are to have that immunity supppressed and exchanged with a flawed synthetically induced immunity which only protects to 1 viral protein (S-protein). While putting immune pressure on that single spike protein with waning immunity, the virus adapts through replication and natural selection for viability, eventually leading to immune escape (as with delta variant, Pfizer efficacy down to 39% in Israel, i.e. booster shots needed).</p>
<p>Every single emergence of mutated VOC's was preceeded by novel vaccine human trials (e.g. delta was seen in India somewhere mid October, while clinical human phase trials were started somewehere mid July, and Earlier, Oxford outsourced its trials in the UK, South-Africa and Brazil, resulting in the respective variants). The virus was already becoming harmles during summer 2020, which is why vaccines had to be rolled out then, if not the pandemic would've ended right there, and that would've ended the frame of opportunity for politics to further dismantle democratic societies throughout the West. Early treatment medicine for covid infection is being prohibited, because infected people are not supposed to get better, because that wouldn't promote the clotshots, nor the fear, nor the lockdowns or any other lunacy were politically being submitted to.</p>

        <p>It's more of a reality than just a scenario. We are seeing it happen with the delta variant as we speak, which is why politics are ramping up their injection efforts and are pushing the unvaccinated relentlesly. A few months ago already, a copy of an email by Dr Tess Lawrie was seen, of her already scrambling to organize doctors to prepare for helping the vaccinated, as unprecedented amounts of expected health issues are going to be seen, all while she herself is under attack from politicized public health "experts" who are pushing the clotshots even harder onto every living soul.</p>

        <p>Nah, they love that. Once they realize people are comfortable taking these pills, they'll introduce Ivermectin v2, one supposedly superior than original, except this will not be generic. It's all marketing strategy to first hold out generic bait, and then charge for this supposed better version. Pfizer and many other pharma are already working on anti-viral pills, and their agenda states, they're for people comfortable taking pills.</p>

        <p>I at no point suggested the use of remdesevir. Learn to fucking read.</p>
<p>I said Ivermectin is a generic that pharma no longer makes money off of. Remdesevir was developed in order to serve as that pharma replacement for ivermectin.</p>
<p>Ivermectin isn't a test drug. A lot of people in my circle have been taking it for months, and it's been around for decades.</p>

        <p>Treatment leading to pharma sales? What do you think the vaccines are??</p>
<p>Also, there are extremely low cost treatment options like hydroxichloriqin and ivermectin. Not to mention zinc and azithromiacin too</p>

        <p>I never said vaccines aren't. Vaccines sell for some, pills for others, and in the end, people are at the mercy of pharma corps. Many countries artificially deflated availability of pills you mentioned to push vaccines, again, at their mercy. If those pills were a plant produce and people could grow in their backyard, then they are truly free of pharma corps, if not greed dictates the terms.</p>
