        <p>They created a shot specifically for birth control. Do you seriously think scientists accidentally included that DNA package in the Covid vaccine to sterilize you?</p>
<p>&rt;Rather than rely on animals’ immune systems to create antibodies, he and his colleagues engineered a piece of DNA that—when packaged inside inactive virus shells and injected into mice—turned their muscle cells into anti-GnRH antibody factories.</p>

        <p>No. Not really. All the people in my life trying to keep their grandparents safe are on top of their shit. They are all educted about mental health and we all check in with each other often to make sure everyone is doing okay and support each other. We all have our opinions on the other topics but they haven't really come up in conversation to be honest, with there being other important topics that have taken focus (mainly BLM and rights for LGBTQIA+ people right now) We are very active in the LGBTQIA+ community and being supportive and cool people there. In fact a bunch of my friends and I did charity streams on Twitch and we raised a ton of money for mental health awareness and suicide prevention organizations (the one I fundraised for had a special focus on teens and young adults). </p>
<p>What I'm saying is that you can't lump everyone together. There isn't two sides here. Its not black or white, it's a spectrum of opinions all stemming from different experiences and places in life. I don't assume all people against wearing masks share the same opinion on all topics, or that all people for wearing masks do either. </p>
<p>I know we all have different opinions, but I just want to make it through this pandemic with everyone's families and friends alive and well.</p>

        <p>I care about all of those things.  When everyone wears masks and doesn't gather unnecessarily, we lower the case numbers so schools can be open (our district has set specific levels at which we can be open), people aren't scared to get necessary medical care, people can get outside and improve their mental and physical health, businesses can stay open, and people spend money at businesses. </p>
<p>I am angry that some of us are forced to sacrifice things that could be relatively safe with masks because some people won't do their share to keep the case numbers under control.  More than anything, I want schools open because many kids need them open, and only privileged families are doing okay with virtual learning.  So wear a mask, don't gather indoors, help us lower the case numbers.</p>
<p>Pretending that COVID isn't real or hasn't killed 350,000 Americans (and it would be many more without all of the efforts some of us have made to keep it from growing to the point that medical providers are overwhelmed) is NOT helping with any of the problems you just cited.  Your denial and refusal to help is making all of those problems worse.  If we all make the most basic efforts, we could make things better for everyone.  And we need real efforts to combat abuse and hunger and improve mental health, things that can be done whether there is a pandemic or not.</p>

        <p>You mean the information from the CDC that multiple causes of death are usually listed along with COVID? Some are conditions that are caused by COVID like respiratory failure and heart failure.   And others are common conditions that people live with for decades like high blood pressure (29% of U.S. adults) and diabetes that make people more vulnerable.  Death certificates usually have multiple causes of death.  And yes, a lot of people -- but not all people -- who die of COVID are vulnerable because of various health conditions or age.  But that doesn't mean their lives weren't valuable.  I think the worst is when a longtime cancer survivor like Herman Cain dies, and people say, "well, he had an underlying condition." Yes, he survived cancer and then COVID killed him. That's a tragedy.</p>

        <p>Can you find any evidence that his cancer came back?  I can't.  Obviously surviving stage four colon cancer affected his body. It may have made him more likely to die of covid thirteen years later.  Which makes it tragic that he got covid and died.  There are many, many cancer survivors out there. Survivors of colon cancer, and childhood leukemia, and breast cancer. They are among the vulnerable people that we are trying to protect. They don't matter less because they had cancer.  That was the point of my statement.</p>

        <p>You seem very certain about masks not working.  I guess you must stay far away from people, since you don't trust the masks.  If the masks help protect people, that gets kids in school and people shopping in small businesses in masks.  No one is forcing me to go out, because I get to work from home and I'm not currently in need of medical care.  But most people are not that lucky.   We do not need to "let the virus run its course" when there are vaccines and we know how to keep the case numbers under control.  We can take responsibility for each other.

        <p>Because politicians from both parties tend to think that they are a special exception to the rules in general, so they convinced themselves that what they were doing was okay and safe enough.  We've all had things we've justified because none of us are perfect, but I think they should have been more careful to follow the rules and make the same sacrifices that they were asking other people to. </p>
<p>In my view, now that we are long past the point of eliminating the virus by staying home, it's about weighing the risks and rewards of different activities, which is affected by what other people are doing and what the case numbers are like and soon will be affected by how many people are vaccinated.  </p>
<p>People who think we have to get down to no cases to do things like send kids to school or gather with friends are not being reasonable. That would be like banning cars to eliminate the risk.  I want to go back to normal, I just don't think we get there by pretending things are normal right now. We're in the last part of a really terrible marathon.</p>

        <p>I'd offer an alternate perspective, which is they understand the true risks of the virus, as well as the efficacy of the so-called "protections" they're imposing on the public.  They know it's all theatrics so they preach it because they have to show their constituents they're Doing Something, but they know it really doesn't make much of a difference overall.  </p>
<p>And...the data bear that out.  We had almost no mask usage during the first COVID spike in the spring.   We can argue about what percentage of people have worn masks since then, but I think it's pretty inarguable that mask usage has increased significantly since the spring, even if we're not at 100% of the populace.</p>
<p>Yet even with increased mask usage, we still see an even bigger spike in COVID numbers as we get into the winter.   Which provides strong evidence that masks aren't as effective as everyone makes them out to be.</p>
<p>And I'm not one of the people that refuses to wear a mask - I don't think they work, but it isn't that big of a deal for me to throw one on before I go into Costco or whatever.  So I do it, but it's pure theater, IMO.  And I think the politicians know that as well.</p>
<p>The one thing I <strong>do</strong> think masks help with is controlling the populace.  Not in a 1984 George Orwell way, but I think if people really understood that the virus is gonna virus no matter what we do, they'd freak out.  Mass panic, looting, hoarding, etc.  What we saw in the spring, only worse.  But the politicians have done a pretty good job of equating "mask usage" with "controlling the disease", which helps keep the masses from panicking.  But that's really the only thing it does.</p>

        <p>I think that's a fair point. I don't think you can look at the spike and say that mask wearing didn't work, because a lot of people were gathering without masks.  I live in an area with pretty high mask usage, but I know there were lots of maskless indoor events in the fall, from homecoming parties to political fundraisers.  But I do think that reassurances about the effectiveness of cloth masks could in part be to encourage people to get back out and spend money and work, and not panic.</p>
<p>But there are studies and a lot of anecdotal evidence that masks reduce the spread and also provide some protection to the wearer.  I wish there were more messages about proper mask wearing and cleaning, though. And I trust my mask a lot more when the case numbers are lower in my area. When we had a lot of cases in my area in late fall, I temporarily changed my behavior back to March/April, going to the grocery store once when it was not busy and then having things delivered.  </p>
<p>That was part of what I was saying.  When we lower the case numbers (and get people vaccinated), masks become a layer of protection that will likely lower our odds if we come into contact with someone who is contagious, especially only briefly (and lowers our odds of spreading the virus all over if we are unknowingly contagious), instead of something we're betting on completely.</p>

        <p>&rt; But there are studies and a lot of anecdotal evidence that masks reduce the spread and also provide some protection to the wearer. </p>
<p>There really aren't, though.  The "studies" that have been done tend to fall into one of two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Laboratory tests in perfect conditions seeing if a mask can block droplets.  Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but these tests ignore the realities of the Real World where people are constantly fiddling with their masks, adjusting them, removing them and basically touching their face 50x more than they otherwise would, thereby completely defeating the purpose.</li>
<li>"meta" analysis that looks at case trends over a period of time.  Most of these studies were done in the ~May/June timeframe when the entire world was seeing a decrease in cases nearly everywhere, regardless of protections.  </li>
</ol>
<p>And, when you step back and at studies done <em>before</em> COVID, the results aren't as rosy:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">This study</a> looks at the efficacy of masks in limiting influenza transmission: </p>
<p>&rt; wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test</p>
<p>And <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">another study</a> looking at the same thing, with the same conclusion:</p>
<p>&rt; evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support [masks as having] a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</p>
<p>IMO, many of the COVID-specific studies have been done with a desired outcome already in mind, so the testing methodology was shaped in order to achieve said outcomes.</p>
<p>And I don't think this is nefarious, per se, because what masks do well at is making the general population <em>feel</em> better about the whole thing and, in that respect, it's a useful public policy instrument that helps the politicians get people to feel safe(r).  But they aren't a useful prophylactic against COVID-19.</p>

I know last year was scary, and this one may be too, and it's easier to pretend it's not happening and that people aren't dying. But if we don't do what small things we can now - physically distance, wear masks - the world may never go back to normal. </p>
<p>We are wasting our time fighting each other instead of working to resolve the issues like abuse, hunger, and lack of mental health resources. Imagine if instead of posting against wearing masks we posted about where to find mental health resources or good organizations working to provide mental health resources that need our support. Or if we protested for human rights for people of color and trans people. Just sayin.</p>

        <p>No one's choosing independently to kill small business and ruin mental health out of selfishness. There are public health orders out. Stop trying to twist the narrative. Ignoring public health orders is the definition of childish anti-social self-centeredness.</p>

        <p>you are choosing to roll over instead of doing your duty to your neighbor, which is to discriminate and reject what is bad. Those who choose to roll over are the primary cause of the lockdowns, providing incentive and reward to the authorities who mandate the lockdowns. If everyone did his job and discriminated, rejecting what is bad, disapproving of ridiculous overreaching behavior, it would not be beneficial for the authorities to attempt the overreaching, and they would have no reason to attempt it. The one who rolls over is the guiltiest party of all, and is himself guilty of the authoritarian overreach.</p>

        <p>Public health orders issued by public health officials who have <em>repeatedly</em> lied to us and then ignored their own orders by dining out, traveling outside of their state, getting haircuts, etc.  </p>

        <p>Clearly you see what “these people” are doing is counterproductive and you think the best course of action is to mimic their behavior. Who’s credibility is shot? </p>
<p>You are less like the triumphant warriors you feel like and more like an eight year old having a tantrum because you can’t eat cake for dinner.</p>

<p>No, actually that's a false conclusion you drew.  I see this as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generally smart, if largely unethical, politicians understanding that the true risk of the disease is far lower than has been put out there by the media.</li>
<li>The same politicians realizing their constituents are scared and DEMANDING ACTION NOW!!!! even if said action doesn't make sense.</li>
</ol>
<p>So they TAKE ACTION NOW to show that they're Doing Something, even if they know that it isn't based on rational, logical reasoning.</p>
