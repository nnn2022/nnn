    <strong>Agree with Dr. Atlas</strong>
    <p><p>We are told to wear a mask to flatten the line so we don't spread the virus. How many people keep their masks in their pockets then put them on when entering a store?  How any people have dropped their masks on the floor or in a parking lot, shook them out and put them on and walked into a store? How many people have tried on sunglasses then put them back on the rack? How many people read the magazines while waiting in line at the grocery store then put them back on the rack? How many people smell scented candles then put them back on the store shelf? How many people have touch the plastic covering on the credit card machine-that no one wipes off-?</p>
<p>But we're mandated to wear a mask!</p></p>
