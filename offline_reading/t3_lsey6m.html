    <strong>Mask Sanctuary Cities??</strong>
    <p><p>Please help! My boyfriend and I are fleeing Austin, TX. The commies have taken over and we are the only ones left who refuse to wear masks. We were recently visiting his family in San Angelo (a smaller west Texas town) and while most people were wearing masks, no one said ANYTHING to us the whole week we were there about wearing a mask. It was such a huge relief that we are now on the hunt for smaller US towns that don‚Äôt give a fuck about masks and will let us live. We are looking at Arkansas and Arizona right now to be closer to family since I‚Äôm pregnant with our first child, but we‚Äôre open to moving anywhere at this point.</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP US FIND A SANCTUARY CITY!! Any information you have helps üôèüèª</p></p>

        <p>Dear OP, as a prepper, I must urge you: STAY AWAY FROM CITIES. They are nothing but death traps, and will go from bad to WHAT_THE_F00K in minutes. Your best bet is to stay away from cities, and stay rural. This is counter-intuitive from what you are looking for, but this will, in the long run, keep you safe. Because when the SHTF, and you're in the city, especially with Uncle Joe Biden at the helm, you can rest assured, things are going to get bad. Keep in mind, the summer even hear yet.</p>
<p>If you are going out of Texas, you want a 2A friendly State, one that is safe, and economically viable. Do not come to the Tri-State area(NY, NJ, CT) as we been f00ked over by our governors, and people are leaving. Have you thought about SD, Idaho or Iowa?</p>
<p>Stay safe and good luck to you and your soon to be family!</p>

        <p>Yes completely agreed. We want to stay rural but need to keep employment in mind for my bf since he will be the only one working for awhile (I will be homeschooling). He‚Äôs an electrician so he should be able to find work most places but we need some stability with employment. It‚Äôs why we‚Äôve been looking in NW Arkansas where we can live rural and he can commute to work. Definitely NOT going east coast unless it‚Äôs Florida but it‚Äôs on the opposite side of the country from our families which makes it a tough decision. We have considered Iowa/SD/ID but are trying to see if we can find a sanctuary COMMUNITY in Arizona before we completely fuck off to a place where we are isolated from all friends / family. We‚Äôre also big preppers and like to be close enough so that when the world shuts down our family could still get to us, ya know?</p>

        <p>Cities unfortunately are usually more liberal, but towns and counties around them may be different and more lenient.  There was the recent news about North Dakota banning mask mandates and Florida sounds pretty free - asides from some businesses that will tell you to wear masks.  </p>
<p>And from my search, it seems that while the governor of Arizona is against a mask mandate, Phoenix and Tuscon have placed them in order unfortunately. </p>
<p>Let me know how your search goes!</p>

        <p>I lived in Phoenix until December and it only grew into a mask zone somewhat recently. For the first 6 months, it was legitimately as though nothing was happening. The first time I ever wore a mask was when I went home to visit family in NJ in July. </p>
<p>As of now, after AZ had a case spike, the masks are definitely more of a widespead thing. I will say though that it is not a place where you will get bullied into wearing one - and there are still spots all over the state that don‚Äôt enforce the mandate. </p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt add much to the query here haha but figured I‚Äôd chime in on Arizona. It really all depends on the location too. Most cities will obviously be stricter but I‚Äôve been in suburbs of Richmond, Nashville, and Florida recently where people don‚Äôt care at all. Your best bet is to find a city in a reasonable state and live outside the city limits.</p>

        <p>This is helpful! We really like Arizona (gun laws, proximity to family, and so much gorgeous landscape). That‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre looking for - a smaller town outside of a bigger city so he can commute to work but we can live relatively free. Thank you for your input!</p>

        <p>I will say between the gun laws, scenery, and the cheap housing it is a great place to live. As someone with a first hand look, I tend to think Phoenix is trending more towards the liberal side of the spectrum though as time goes on. </p>
<p>I would also note as someone who moved from a greener climate that the poor air quality can be a bit worrisome/ noticeable at times. Overall I tend to favor Tucson for this reason. While it‚Äôs a bit more low key, it tends to feel more laid back and the air quality there is night and day better than PHX. Definitely check both out and see which one you end up liking more. If things progress and you need advice on the nicer areas to live in either city, feel free to reach out.</p>

        <p>If you can handle the cold anything an hour or so north of Portland Maine is beautiful. Constitutional carry, lots of land, no body cares what you do,  farming is big and tons of natural attractions. The majority of people don't care about masks as long as you don't step into one of the artsy shit holes. </p>

        <p>NC has become a liberal shithole and the governor has kept strict measures in place. SC doesn't have a mask mandate but the cities have ordinances in place and I get nasty looks for going without a mask. Arkansas or AZ sounds awesome.</p>
