    <strong>Absolute Risk Reduction if you get vaccinated is MINISCULE if you're under 60 and reasonably healthy</strong>
    <p><p>Here's some stats on IFR (for Covid-19)  &rt; https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/</p>
<p>80+ years old &rt;&rt; 14.8%</p>
<p>70-79 years old &rt;&rt; 8.0%</p>
<p>60-69 years old &rt;&rt; 3.6%</p>
<p>50-59 years old &rt;&rt; 1.3%</p>
<p>40-49 years old &rt;&rt; 0.4%</p>
<p>30-39 years old &rt;&rt; 0.2%</p>
<p>20-29 years old &rt;&rt; 0.2%</p>
<p>10-19 years old &rt;&rt; 0.2%</p>
<p>0-9 years old &rt;&rt; no fatalities </p>
<p>These percentages indicate your chance of dying if you catch SARS-Cov-2. </p>
<p>Let's also look at serious cases, since the vaccines are looking to reduce your <strong>relative</strong> risk of serious illness by around 90%.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">According to here</a>, there are 11,639,458 active Covid-19 cases, of which 83,022 are serious. (83,022 / 11,639,458) * 100 = 0.71%</p>
<p>So 0.71% of cases turn out to be serious. </p>
<p>A 90% reduction from 0.71% would turn that into 0.071%, or in actual numbers, a reduction from 83,022 serious cases to just 5894 serious cases around the world.</p>
<p>That sounds...well, it sounds OK, except if you realise the vast majority of cases are over 70 years old (see IFR rates which obviously imply that the vast majority of serious cases are elderly patients).</p>
<p>SO, let's look at someone in their 40s.  They have a 0.4% chance of death if they catch SARS-Cov-2.  If they are vaccinated, let's be "generous" towards the vaccine's benefits and assume all serious cases result in death.  Therefore, the vaccine would reduce the chance of death from 0.04% to 0.004%, or an absolute risk reduction of 0.036% for any given individual in their 40s (again, assuming 90% relative efficacy).  In your 20s, that drop is from 0.02% to 0.002%, or an 0.018% absolute risk reduction.  </p>
<p>This is not to even speak of comorbidities! If you are young and healthy, your chances of death or serious illness from Covid are surely significantly lower than 0.02% if you're in your 20s, and 0.04% if you're in your 40s.  I would venture that most of these serious cases and deaths in these age ranges had some underlying comorbidities that greatly impaired their immune system response to the virus.  It would not be unreasonable to think that your chance of death if you have NO comorbidities and you're in reasonably good shape would be at least 5x lower than the average stats (I think I'm being very much on the low side here, but it's better to underestimate).  So you'd be looking at an Absolute Risk Reduction of 0.004% to 0.0004% if you're in your 20s, you're healthy (let's include being sufficient in vitamin D here), and you get vaccinated. I mean, whoopdy doo on that risk reduction.  </p>
<p>We were sold these vaccines on a relative risk reduction, which makes them sound a lot sexier, because a lot of people basically think that they have "90% less chance of serious problems than the unvaccinated". This is true <strong>relative</strong> to the unvaccinated, but not in <strong>absolute</strong> terms. When you line up two people, one vaccinated, the other not...and you say person A has a 99.996% chance of surviving Covid, and person B has a 99.9996% chance of surviving Covid, they are hardly different.  In fact, at that level of small difference, surely lifestyle factors come into play: how healthy is your diet? Do you smoke? Do you exercise regularly? Are you sufficient or deficient in vitamin D?</p>
<p>I will reiterate - at the opposite end of the age scale, reducing chance of death from roughly 15% to 1.5% is significant, and that's where I'd probably roll the dice and think that the vaccine is worth taking versus the higher risk of serious symptoms/death from Covid.</p>
<p>However, everything we're being told is all "one size fits all".  This is where the younger people (I'd put that range at under 60!) are being conned.  The absolute risk reduction is so small but we wouldn't know that because the relative risk reduction is the only one mentioned.</p>
<p>If any of my figures are wrong, I'm happy to be corrected.</p></p>

<p>bear in mind <strong>ALL coronavirus numbers are JUNK</strong></p>
<p>because unless someone is tested they don't become a statistic. Is it 1 hospitalisation in 100 infections? 1000? 10,000, 100,000?</p>
<p>Then the problem with tests - the tests are junk.</p>
<p>Then the problem with recording and compiling data - different countries different protocols - the whole thing is a complete swamp.</p>

        <p>Oh I hear you 100%.  I know very well PCR tests are worthless results with high cycle counts and that they're not even designed to find a partcular, isolated virus.  However, even just using their junk stats, the absolute risk reduction benefit (for taking a vaccine) for anyone under 60 is so tiny, it's not worth the risks. I thought it would be a useful argument to throw out there at young (and in this context, under 60), healthy people who are wondering whether to take the vaccines or not.</p>

<p>Interesting.  So the inference here is that serious case percentages should be even lower, right?</p>
<p>Do these studies cover the entire world, or only specific locations?</p>

        <p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>&rt; the available evidence suggests average global IFR of ~0.15%</p>
<p>This makes the absolute risk reduction (benefit) of vaccines even more ridiculously miniscule for anyone under 60...it also calls into question as to why they aren't testing people for antibodies to see if they need the vaccine or not...?! The more I look into this, the less sense everything makes (in terms of government policies).</p>

<p>Died in a car crash, but tested positive 26 days ago with no symptoms? - Covid death</p>
<p>Jumped off a 32nd story building, but tested positive 27.5 days ago and only had mild symptoms - you died of covid</p>
<p>Be decapitated in a motorcycle crash, on the way back from having the test for it to later come back positive (after the accident?) - Covid killed you</p>

        <p>100%.  The difference between being vaccinated or not is such a thin sliver of "less risk", even general lifestyle factors will come into play.  Just right off the bat, being obese or not being obese - the difference here is HUGE in regards to risk of complications with Covid.  Does Fauxi ever mention this? Never, ever.  We're all the same to him.  We're all exactly the same.  Lifestyle isn't a thing, weight isn't a thing.  Therapeutics (as you mention)? No can do.  Vitamin D, oh he mentioned it once in passing reluctantly, therefore he "covered vitamin D" (ha!).  Line up and take your lipid nanoparticles that leak out of your deltoid muscle to deliver the mRNA that produce cytotoxic spike proteins in your ovaries, bollocks and bone marrow!</p>

<p>Let us also assume the worst instance: that the vaccines have long term consequences 5-10 years down the road, especially if there are going to be regular booster shots that are recommended.</p>
<p>The 80+ crowd is unlikely to live long enough to realize such consequences.</p>
<p>It also depends on what the consequences are.  One concern is infertility.  The average octogenarian is likely infertile or has very low fertility anyways.  And I seriously doubt many of them are looking to have children anyways.</p>

<p>These are official numbers, but one of the members of the government C19 group said in January: "160k people tested positive for covid, but we believe that about 500k-600k people have contracted covid". So the actual death rates are probably about 3-4 times lower. In any case people younger than (at least) 35 should not get vaccinated.</p>

<p>The truth is that ALL of this lockdown was to protect the financial well being of the healthcare industry. If 20% of old/sick people died, the healthcare industry would lose 20% of their paying customers.</p>
<p>There is NO money to be made in a cure. There is only money to be made in the TREATMENT.</p>

        <p>See, I think we do.</p>
<p>Some vaccines are viral vector. We know how they work.</p>
<p>The new ones are mRNA and they've been researching into those for decades and know how they work. They were limited by a few things, mainly the delivery method, but recent technology sorted that out. The actual vaccine itself has been long studied and tested and went through enough safety checks to get authorisation (and full on approval in some countries).</p>
<p>They've given it to hundreds of millions of people. They've done checks and tests. They know it leaves the body after 72 hours.</p>
<p>No one vaccine has long term problems, and this one just builds upon those.</p>
<p>It's honestly like saying a new mobile phone with a few extra features hasn't been tested and could give you cancer. We don't know the long term effects of the Galaxy S20 because its only been out a short time. That would be ridiculous. We are very sure of the long term safety of the underlying technology and incredibly similar things they've done before.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the mRNA vaccine is to instruct your cells to make the spike protein. But the spike protein is a toxin. The idea you are trying to convey:</p>
<p>\&rt;it leaves the body after 72 hours</p>
<p>shows you have no idea what you are talking about or are trying to lie.</p>

<p>In other words, you can say "it's been studied for decades" all you want, but there is a good chance you're going to find out shit you didn't know even after all the safety checks.</p>
<p>And you do realize that Dr. Robert Malone, one of the inventors of mRNA vaccines, has concerns about the COVID vaccine rollout so far.  He is not exactly what you would call a quack.  </p>
