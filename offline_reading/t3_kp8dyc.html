        <p>I think that selfishness should be balanced with altruism. If everyone scarifies their happiness for the greater good, then what is the greater good? Apparently not people, because they're all unhappy for the greater good. Is it the government? They normally benefit from measures taken for the greater good.</p>
<p>Out of altruism I want other people to take good care of themselves so that they can be happy and that means that I do not want everyone to sacrifice their happiness for the greater good. Expecting other people to give up everything for the greater good is selfish.</p>

        <p>In that case the greater good has been achieved and the lockdowns are not necessary for the greater good because COVID-19 is not more dangerous than whatever was already floating around before it.</p>
<p>Besides, the basic human right to freedom is still more important than stopping an actual dangerous virus for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Human freedom would result in stopping the virus. If the virus was more harmful than the measures then people would want to use their freedom to stop the virus. No propaganda or physical violence would be necessary.</li>
<li>Freedom is power, by definition. Freedom is power over yourself. e.g. if you have the freedom to say whatever you want then you have the power to say whatever you want and if you have the freedom to travel then you have the power to travel. Giving up freedom is thus synonymous with giving power over the people to some other entity. Once such an entity (e.g. the government or banks) has so much power over the people that it can limit basic human rights it will also have enough power to limit the rights we need to keep it in check (e.g. free speech, open court trials, etc). At that point the people will be completely defenceless against that entity and any evil that might be in it or that might be able to infiltrate it will have complete reign over the people. If a terrorist manages to get a foothold in such a powerful entity then a dictatorship will be the result. Thus giving up freedom is dangerous.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's why cowards giving up freedom for safety will have neither of those. The only way to be safe is to have freedom and use that freedom wisely. If you want to fight for the greater good then you need to freedom i.e. power to do so.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 is an exceptionally dangerous virus, with both of your points operating under the opposite assumption. Even if it doesn’t kill you, it has a high likelihood to leave you with further health conditions, that are suspected to be able to become long term (we of course don’t know that they will, but the chance is there).</p>
<ol>
<li>This point relies on the fact that the general public is both intelligent and compassionate, which simply isn’t the case. A study (happy to reference upon request) performed by multiple psychology professors in Brazil demonstrate that those with low empathy will not undergo measures to reduce the spread. Further studies referenced by this one show that there are many other factors that indicate people do not care about limiting the spread. Without lockdown rules, these people and more would go about their day as normal, spreading the disease everywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>Or, what about offices, where without mandatory lockdowns people would be forced to go to work regardless of wanting to limit spread.</p>
<ol>
<li>This point is overshadowed by the point that, sometimes, we need to give up little freedoms such as the ability to travel in order to save lives. You think I want to be stuck in my house for months on end??? Of course not, but I’ll do it anyway even if it means that only one less person has to be exposed to this horrific disease.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are not cowards to trying to limit the spread of a dangerous disease. What “freedom” will do in this case is give people the freedom to harm everyone around them.</p>

        <p>I have not read it yet but in the conclusion it says "The increase in COVID-19 cases in the country are not associated with people's adherence to containment measures." which seems to make it a pretty poor paper to choose if you want to defend the lockdowns.</p>
<p>But my point 1 did not assume that people are compassionate so the paper does not really matter either way. If COVID-19 was really dangerous and lockdowns were necessary for protection then selfish people would have plenty of incentive to support the lockdown. Their incentive would be not dying to a deadly virus.</p>
<p>Even if someone being selfish increases the chance that he does not support the lockdowns then that still does not really prove anything. It's just a correlation. There's no indication what causes what or if there's a third factor involved or even whether it's just a coincidence. This would still not prove that selfish people would kill themselves in a real dangerous pandemic.</p>
<p>As for people being informed, it's pretty hard to not notice it when many people around you are dying to a deadly virus. Many people doubt COVID-19 because many people see nothing happen. I'm surrounded with people who ignore the safety measures and we've been through 2 waves and nothing happened. Even flu season leaves a far bigger mark. If it was not for the news then I would not even suspect that anything like COVID-19 even existed. </p>
<p>In addition to that, a lot of the measures taken would be ineffective or even counterproductive in a real pandemic. This does not help in granting enough confidence in authorities demanding that I give up my human rights to them.</p>

        <p>Those highlights directly contradict the article, which is very interesting. The first line of the "Discussions and Conclusions" section states "Containment measures have been the most effective way to flatten the curve of COVID-19 contamination" and even provides a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30129-8/fulltext">source</a>. The source states "Containment of COVID-19 should remain the focus at the moment. The short-term cost of containment will be far lower than the long-term cost of non-containment" while also providing realism in that lockdown cannot be indefinite.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-long-term-health-effects/covid-19-long-term-health-effects#:~:text=COVID%2D19%3A%20long,of%20smell%20and%20taste">very dangerous.</a> The issue is that media has portrayed otherwise. Fox News was the most-watched cable news network in the US, and they downplay the virus. It isn't exactly hard to claim or prove that this network is extremely unreliable, a borderline joke. That being said, people watch and trust it. </p>
<p>It's not just selfishness. It's anti-social personality disorder. It's narcissism. It's a general lack of empathy. The issue is that measures like wearing masks are one-way. They offer minimal protection to the wearer, but are very effective at helping those around the wearer. So these people would see that wearing a mask doesn't help them, so they don't bother. Add in general anti-mask statements (which I won't go into because it is just misinformation) and we're looking at a general populace who refuses to take any sort of measure to limit the spread, simply down to misinformation or narcissism. </p>

<p>Your point about not seeing Covid deaths around you is entirely anecdotal. Just because it's not affecting you, doesn't mean it's not affecting anyone else. Now I will admit that, if your family and friends are all young and healthy, then chances are COVID will not have a dramatic effect on you. But it is exceptionally selfish to attempt to argue that people shouldn't follow lockdown just because they haven't seen it first hand. The CDC has stated that COVID is more serious than the flu. Also, that's literally the purpose of the news. To inform you of things happening around the country/world, either before it reaches you or stuff that, like I said, can be hard to notice if you aren't particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I fail to see how wearing masks, social distancing, limiting seeing people etc are counterproductive. This is a "real pandemic". You aren't giving up your "human rights".</p>

        <p>&rt; COVID-19 is very dangerous. The issue is that media has portrayed otherwise. Fox News was the most-watched cable news network in the US, and they downplay the virus. It isn't exactly hard to claim or prove that this network is extremely unreliable, a borderline joke. That being said, people watch and trust it. </p>
<p>Yes, they trust it, and that's why they're afraid of COVID-19. You cannot downplay a real deadly pandemic because people will notice it when people around them are dying. Do you think that people will go "hey, many of my friends and family are dying to some kind of disease but Fox News says it's OK, so I'm sure nothing is wrong."?</p>
<p>The media is the sole reason that most of us even know about the virus. without the media most people would be blissfully unaware of COVID-19. If you want people to fear COVID-19 then you should thanks Fox News for their repeated coverage of it. COVID-19 is a media sensation much more than it is a pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt;Your point about not seeing Covid deaths around you is entirely anecdotal. Just because it's not affecting you, doesn't mean it's not affecting anyone else. Now I will admit that, if your family and friends are all young and healthy, then chances are COVID will not have a dramatic effect on you.</p>
<p>Actually we help a lot of elderly whom happen to be desperate for human contact thanks to the draconian anti-social distancing rules.</p>
<p>Either way, by far most people will have similar experiences to mine. Just look around and see whether the people you know have been hurt more by the measures or by COVID-19. It's easy to find people who lost their livelihood to the measures or to find elderly who are very unhappy due to the measures, but it's very hard to personally find someone who actually died to COVID-19. </p>
<p>All we have to believe that COVID-19 is dangerous is someone's word. No one sees it in their own life. I challenge you to find someone that was not on the verge of death to begin with who died to COVID-19. Maybe you'll find them on the news, but you'll never find anyone like that in real life. As for anyone reading this, do not take our word, look in your own life.</p>
<p>This is just like in Germany where all authorities were sure that Jews were dangerous. If only people back then would have just looked around in their own lives and see for themselves how dangerous Jews really were instead of blindly following the propaganda then the Nazi regime would have had a much harder time rounding up Jews. Now we have the same situation but COVID-19 takes the place of Jews. And this lockdown —if we let it happen— will last until the people behind it rule the entire world or someone stops them by force. Why would they give back power to us once they can just keep it for themselves? Even if they were genuine about the virus (which they're not) why would they give power back once COVID-19 is gone and they have all the power to do whatever they want with it? Temporary dictatorships do not exist because every dictatorship will keep itself in power until the day that it's taken down by force. So if you want a temporary dictatorship to combat COVID-19 then you're asking for trouble.</p>
<p>&rt;The CDC has stated that COVID is more serious than the flu. Also, that's literally the purpose of the news. To inform you of things happening around the country/world, either before it reaches you or stuff that, like I said, can be hard to notice if you aren't particularly vulnerable.</p>
<p>Yes, Nazi Germany and similar dictatorships had a lot of "science" on their side as well. The CDC is contradicting themselves and is using guidelines that exaggerate the COVID-19 caused deaths. You're willing to start a temporary dystopian dictatorship based on the word of the CDC? The CDC does not have authority over human rights and neither are they immune to being bought. These folks have the power to put the world on lockdown, they have already bought the CDC and the news. That's why your own observations are key because that's the only thing that cannot be bought. Dictatorships of the past also had all scientists on their side. Stalin and Hitler were very "scientific" and in my country one of the currently most prominent newspapers actually used to be a Nazi propaganda paper back in the day. The news is one of the first things to go corrupt when a distatorship is starting because it's one of the most effective propaganda channels.</p>
<p>&rt;I fail to see how wearing masks, social distancing, limiting seeing people etc are counterproductive. </p>
<p>They make people starve by making businesses go bankrupt, they force old people to die in isolation (which is torture), they force people to keep distance from their friends and family, etc.</p>
<p>&rt;You aren't giving up your "human rights".</p>
<p>We may not travel, we may not have a business, we're forced to wear an unhygienic mask, we may not invite people in our homes, we may not take proper care of our elders, etc. That infringes rights to property, rights to free You fail to see how a literal dystopian lockdown could harm our human rights? Is this 1984? What's 2+2?</p>
<p>The rights that are harmed are:
- No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
- No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.
- No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.
- (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.
(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.
- (1) Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others.
(2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.
- (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
- (3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.</p>
<p>Those are all the articles that describe our rights that are being trampled right now. But I'm sure more will follow, as the dystopian dictatorship is just getting started.</p>

        <p>Just look at e.g. Thailand via Youtube. It's a country where many people depend on tourism to not starve. It's now empty because all countries are on lockdown. Guess how many thousands of people are starving there right now? You cannot destroy the world economy without killing people. People need the economy to live.</p>
<p>My biggest objection to masks is signaling approval to these draconian measures that kill people and trample on our rights. Just imagine if people started insisting that you wear a swastika for some silly reason. Would you object? Why? "It's just a symbol. It does not hurt you to wear it. So selfish." I do not want to signal my approval and obedience to bunch of power hungry people who are now mass murdering humans and mass trampling rights. I named the rights that are trampled and if you fail to see why I can explain each of them. Though most of them should be obvious. Or are you going to argue that e.g. forbidding travel between countries does not violate our right to travel between countries?</p>
<p>The measures are not as bad as Nazi Germany's were at it's worst, but the analogy still fits perfectly. Nazi Germany was not that bad in the beginning either. It took a while before they started rounding up Jews and doing their other horrible crimes. We're in the beginning of COVID-1984 and compared to the beginning of the Nazi regime it's a good comparison. The Nazi's at their worst are giving a good idea of what we're heading towards.</p>
<p>These authoritarian dystopias have to be stopped before they start to kill people. They need to be stopped as soon as they trample on even a single human right. But instead we let them violate our rights one by one. And that's why we're going to get it as bad as any other dictatorship. The only thing that's new is the fact that this is worldwide. That has never happened before.</p>
<p>Whenever you get confronted with an argument that you cannot refute you just stick your head in the sand and keep repeating that whoever made the argument is deluded just so you can support the rising dictatorship and embrace your slavery. You've already lost many human rights and you are fighting to lose even more of them.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wish you a nice day. I understand that most people won't understand what's going on, that's how it is with every dictatorship. We'll have to wait until this regime falls like those before it and then people will look back on us like they look back at other dictatorships. Just like they go now "Wow, I would never wear a star if I were a Jew Nazi Germany back when it was just starting, it's degrading" they will then go "Wow, I would never wear a mask in the COVID-1984 regime back when it was just starting, it's degrading".</p>

        <p>I think the problem is, the way that terms have been established as part of the COVID discourse is "selfish" means that one is shamed for making sure oneself is taken care of first <em>before</em> one can assess how much one can be taking care of others, as opposed to the idea that <em>this is the default state of how humans operate</em>.</p>

        <p>Sure there are, but the boomers are the ones literally in charge of almost everything. They are calling the shots and the younger ones are completely in lockstep. There's enough people pissed at both groups that once the boomers start to really die off there will be a paradigm shift, though I have no idea which way it's going to swing.</p>

        <p>There are, but they believe what the worst of the Boomers/older Xers want them to, because they first undermined the education system then flooded them with contradictory propaganda and stood back to let them fight. The younger ones are more the useful idiots.</p>

        <p>I have to respectfully disagree with that; of course there are some entitled old people, but to me it seems like it's less grandmas themselves wanting us to do all this, but younger people on their behalf wanting us to do all this. Now, granted, I do have an old relative I've never even met in person who lives far away that calls me periodically to tell me I should wear a face diaper because I'm killing my parents, but most older people that I've spoken are also against this rather than for it. That's just what I've seen. But I just think this young generation is more entitled, since they're the snowflakes who want everything done for them and for everyone to obey what they want while the older people went off in wars and actually fought for freedom. I just see more young people for all this crap than older people.</p>

<p>I'm reluctant to say "boomers" actually, actively, <em>caused</em> all these problems. I was literally just ranting and raging at my peak-boomer Dad about how "<em>YOU</em>" (he, not you) let all this happen. YOU let "them" take our country over, YOU allowed the cabal to grow and worm it's way into every facet of society that has power, allowed them to do this to our government and economy, but it was all through complacency and being duped, not actively doing it themselves. They didn't know and still don't, they have no idea what's happened, and how bad it really is. It's not really their fault, that's like blaming your parent's generation for losing a war 50 years ago and your nation being conquered by an oppressive empire, because they got beat when they didn't even know the enemy was coming. The enemy was treacherous, hidden. They didn't have the internet to get the truth. All they got was what they were fed. It sucks, and yeah I'm a little pissed at them for letting it happen, but again, you gotta blame the conquering oppressors, not the last generation that pretty much just lived their lives and didn't even know they were being conquered.</p>

        <p>Most elderly people inside residences actually prefer to die than to keep living being unable to do anything or seeing anyone. They feel alone and loneliness is killing them mentally.</p>

        <p>Boomers are the one after the WWII generation. As to them, though, they didn't necessarily. Asked about the war by my cousin for a school project, my grandad, much to said cousin's horror at the contra-accepted narrative response, declared it to have been 'the time of his life'. He was a handsome devil in his army uniform. For a lot of working class lads, there was really no space in it for high-falutin' ideals that put a shiny gloss on war, there never has been. They did it, 'cos the government said so, made them in some cases.</p>

        <p>I think war has always been both the "time of their lives" and simultaneously/potentially also the most horrific hell they've ever seen. The camaraderie and purpose and, yeah, a little instinctual drive to "crush your enemy, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentation/maybe score some of their women" has always been something men just get something out of. I have never been to war, but I just seem to hear this duality description of war pretty much all my life. That some guys <em>miss</em> being "over there" and it being some of their best memories, while also obviously some guys being seriously fucked up from it, losing their friends, etc. Some guys I'm sure maybe a bit of both.</p>

        <p>My family is pro lockdown.  No inheritance is worth that.  We’re dead broke but we can’t not fight.  Honestly though the real reason I got disinherited was because of who I married.  Red blooded American.  Went through the army.  My grandfather is first in line for the shot and unless we submit probably won’t speak to us based on history.</p>

        <p>I don't know if I would go quite that far, but people who <em>still</em> believe in the lockdowns, mandates, etc., don't deserve the few freedoms that they have left, let alone any free money they might get.  If my grandkids were doomers, I'd be happier setting their inheritance on fire for the fun of it.</p>

        <p>Well, we are conspiracy theorists. All of here, more or less, theorize about conspiracies. Just because we're "conspiracy theorists" doesn't mean we're wrong. </p>
<p>The term "conspiracy theorist" has lost all meaning at this point. People have completely warped its meaning into something bad or crazy, but just theorizing about conspiracies doesn't make you either of those things. In a lot of cases, it's because you're smarter.</p>

If I were truly vulnerable I would ask my family to carry on with their lives as normal and bring me a stationary bike, lots of books and crosswords, and fresh food every week as I holed up. I would demand it. I would paint signs on my house saying "DONT STOP SOCIETY FOR ME. I'M ISOLATING. I'M FINE." Wtf is wrong with these people that every single one of them isn't doing this?</p>

        <p>"conspiracy theorist" is not an insult. It sounds like one because we've been conditioned to emote to it in that way. A theorist is someone who thinks, a conspiracy theorist is someone who thinks about conspiracies. Why would it be weird for powerful people to work together to get more power? Thinking about conspiracies makes perfect sense. You'd have to be an idiot to disbelieve in them based on nothing but the assumption that conspiracies cannot exist. I take conspiracy theorist as a compliment, I do think about conspiracies.</p>
<p>Of course, that's taking the scientific meaning of "theory" where a theory is just a set of thoughts about something, even if those thoughts are proven to be true. In science a theory can be proven and true.</p>
<p>Though due to the emotional reaction that people have it may be better to not use the word right now. Many people act out of emotion more than out of reason so although being a conspiracy theorist is no reason to have your theories (many of which may also facts because a theory can be a fact and all (known) facts are theories) dismissed it does provide emotion to dismiss it.</p>
<p>A fun thing to point out though, is that most people who dismiss conspiracy theories for no other reason then it being about a conspiracy do believe the conspiracy theory that Bin Laden took down the Twin Towers. And yes, that is a conspiracy theory. Bin Laden supposedly did not fly down that plain on his own, he supposedly conspired with other people in secret. So those people do believe conspiracy theories, it's just that they only believe in the ones that are officially approved by their government. That's a nice example of double think "Conspiracies cannot exist and have not existed" and "any conspiracy of which my government says it happened happened". This is 1984 levels of stupidity but that's what you get when you have blind trust in the mainstream news.</p>

        <p>On that note, I'm watching a French history documentary series at the moment, just got up to Louis XI...nicknamed 'the universal spider' for his impressive plotting. Given that people accept even the most shameless and utterly vicious plotting as 'just how it was' from royalty, as though it's just normal and inevitable, from nobles, from royal governments, between members of said governments, and considering it is blatant and admitted that there is at least some level of behind-the-scenes scheming from our clearly only nominally democratic governments, I've really no idea why people seem able to switch off that awareness and behave as though, all of a sudden, it must all just be what's in our best interests. I wonder how many of the peasants of the past -who seem to do nothing but alternately going along with aristo nonsense and getting clobbered by them- they managed to keep convinced of that?</p>

        <p>What is the name of the documentary? Maybe I'd like to watch it, I'm decent at French.</p>
<p>As for the behind-the-schemes plotting, it's obvious to anyone who knows what's going on. Fiat currency scams, obviously paid-for laws such as copyright, etc make it more than obvious that the government is corrupt. And there are better hidden secrets which are still pretty obvious to those looking for it long enough.</p>
<p>It seems strange that people would allow these things to happen but there are many psychological tricks at work here. When you control the money supply (and thus have infinite money) then it's easy to also control news, politics, and education and when you control those then you can easily mold people to prevent critical thought and to teach them blind obedience. Generation by generation people have been dumbed down starting at least back when mandatory schooling was introduced. Powerful people are not powerful by coincidence, they know what they're doing much better than we do and they keep their families in power by planning far ahead. Of course, they do not put that on our curricula.</p>
<p>Looking back with hindsight it's easy to see how irrational people were in past dictatorships and the like but few people can discern the craziness if they're raised right in it as one of the oppressed people.</p>

        <p>It's « La Guerre des trônes » and episodes can be found on YouTube, first one here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQhKfnreENk
Popular history, but seems Ok for a fast overview, I've been using Wiki to see a bit more detail and keep the family trees straight. It's interesting to see it from a perspective that was indeed not on my, very nationalistic, English school curricula, with divide the people to rule over them definitely being one of their tricks.</p>
<p>It is strange, people seem to understand the government is corrupt at times, but then still, like someone in an abusive relationship, are driven into telling themselves it 'can't be that bad' and that it 'doesn't really count as abusive/oppressive'.</p>

        <p>You know there are conspiracy theories that the Earth is flat vaccines are deadly, everyone famous is either in the Illuminati or a reptilian, 5G is deadly, Donald Trump won the 2020 election, and my favorite that aliens came to Earth and created 40 half human half aliens (Jesus,who came back from the dead through cloning, Muhammad, Moses and the Buddha to name 4) and we need to A.destroy the nukes and B. build a landing pad in Hawaii so that the Aliens come back and when they come there will be no war and crime will be ended through genetic engineering. TL;DR there are a lot of conspiracies and most of them are dumb, not all but most, and those are what people like to make fun of</p>

        <p>I actually agree. I think conspiracy theories are crazy which is why I would never consider myself a conspiracy theorist and take offense to being called one. I just don't understand why people think it must be a conspiracy to think that this reaction to a virus is overkill.</p>

        <p>It's because they've lost any power they once had when the lockdown started.  They don't truly care about anyone else other then themselves or immediate family, as exampled time and again by spewing vitriol at anyone who goes against what they believe by wishing death upon them.</p>

        <p>Good thing you have absolutely no medical background to have an opinion that matters on if the vaccine is rushed or not or if masks work or not :) </p>
<p>We've been using these vaccines for 7 years and haven't had a single bad case. 99% of trained doctors think this vaccine is safer than covid, I'd say they know what they're talking about better than us.</p>
<p>Also, my father in law used to work for big pharma as a biotech engineer. He was in charge of making sure treatments were safe. After 30 years, he quit cuz he couldn't stand working for these greedy assholes anymore... And he's still getting the vaccine cuz the pro outweighs the cons.</p>
<p>This is someone that is qualified to have an opinion, that has 1st hand experience of the abuse of big pharma and still chooses to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Without vaccines, you would likely not be alive as you or your ancestors wouldn't have made it past 12 years old. Research Queen Anne and her 18 pregnancies it took her to produce an heir. Only the 18th kid made it to adulthood. That's a queen, with access to best Healthcare at the time.</p>

        <p>All I'm saying is it should be a choice, and it's mainly this vaccine I'm against, for the main reason that I'm just not scared of the virus, and if you are, you're free to take the vaccine. But I want a choice. I just don't worry about this virus because it's proven not to be serious.</p>

        <p>It, really, is just a piece of cloth. It's the same with clothes. They're literal pieces of cloth, right? So why wear them? They don't oppress you, do they? But according to your logic, clothes are dangerous, and that society is pushing that you're a psychopath and an outcast if you don't wear clothes. Your logic is very flawed.</p>

        <p>Keep using 'grandmas' as an excuse.  You know that it's wrong, but you're used to being wrong aren't you?  You're already used to be laughed at and made fun of, so why not also show a disregard for basic human life while you're at it?</p>
<p>You're wrong and you know that you're wrong, and you're using complete callousness to quiet the cognitive dissonance, because at least that makes you feel tough.</p>
<p>You're weak and gross.  But here's the thing, you've probably ALWAYS been weak and gross, this is just showing it to everyone</p>

        <p>I'm not bothered by the stupid piece of fabric, I'm bothered by the fact that despite wearing it my freedom is severely restricted, almost as if it doesn't work. Why are you bringing up masks in this thread tho? Can we talk about how classist the lockdowns are and how many millions of lives they've ruined? Do you have a minute for that or are you rushing off to virtue signal in another unrelated thread?</p>

        <p>Let's talk about how masks and lockdowns worked everywhere that they were fully implemented and people weren't so stupid that they called it an attack on freedom.</p>
<p>Let's talk about how people like you are so afraid of the word socialism, that we couldn't even come together to make our government support small businesses and families, and instead gave money and taxbreaks to the ultra rich, like the GOP ALWAYS does.</p>
<p>Let's talk about how Republican politicians and conservative voters are turning America into a desolate hellscape.</p>
<p>I doubt you want to though.  I'm sure the reason other countries are able to NOT destroy their economy going through a lockdown is all just a conspiracy right?</p>
<p>Both sides are just as bad right?</p>
<p>If you have any virtues worth a shit, maybe you should signal them too.</p>
<p>Maybe if you care about reality, even a little bit, you should listen to scientists instead of pundits and entertainers.  The evidence is all out there, available to you, but you have to care enough to find it.  And you have to be willing to accept that you're wrong</p>

        <p>Can you give me an example of everywhere? It's easy. You just open <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">this</a> link here and find a country where it worked, other than Australia and New Zealand. I'm assuming you're american and most of them think that lockdowns 'worked' in Europe but haven't updated their info on the topic since June. Look at France, the UK, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Czechia. I can name more.</p>
<p>I never mentioned being afraid of socialism, although I'm very scared of a world that resembles China. My parents and grandparents have lived through socialism and their memories of it are somewhat neutral so I can't be a fair judge here. But I suppose I know more about it than the average american leftie so that's something. </p>
<p>Speaking of socialism, I don't support wealth hoarding but that's exactly what this pandemic has enabled. The biggest wealth transfer in our recent history. And you still support it while also supporting small local businesses staying shut. For how long? And what kind of country can afford to keep at least 70% of its citizens safe at home and giving them money for it for a whole damn year? I can name a few which are wealthy enough - Norway and UAE. But what about everyone else? Are lockdowns meant to sustain the rich and middle class, the cushy work from home people, the tech bros, while the rest have to work and bring them goods?</p>
<p>Just take a good look <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/kn2xe4/all_the_detrimental_effects_of_lockdowns_divided/">here</a> and tell me that I'm detached from reality and you aren't. Tell me how the policies you support are ruining the lives of so many people but I'm the bad person. Or go somewhere else to pretend that you give a shit about the poor because I'm not bying it anymore.</p>

        <p>You just made my point for me.</p>
<p>Australia gave people the money they needed and told them to stay home and wear a mask when you go out, and australians realized that wasn't an attack on their freedoms or the fragile egos, and they made it work.</p>
<p>Lockdowns don't work if you keep giving money to all your rich friends while you let families starve and get evicted, but that's what we let the republican leadership do, like they always have done.</p>
<p>I've been unemployed since March of last year, trying to get by on $170 a week.  I am the poor.</p>
<p>We as a country have more than enough money to take care of all of our people, but large portions of our population straight up don't want that, and vote conservative to make sure it doesn't happen</p>

        <p>If germ transmission was affected by wearing a dunce cap then yes, I would.  That's a stupid thing to say though, because the 2 aren't even REMOTELY similar.</p>
<p>And you very clearly are not pro life, you're just anti abortion.  If you cared about other people's lives at all you'd be willing to make adjustments to yours to protect others.  But you don't care about anything other than yourself and your comfort</p>

        <p>I'm afraid they are similar, since if I see someone with a face diaper, it's basically the same thing to me. It's just dehumanizing and I'm willing to bet you wouldn't see any difference if people just stopped wearing them completely. 
How do you know I'm anti-abortion? (I am, but you shouldn't assume). "Protect others" it does nothing. Even if it would, the health of the people around me is not my responsibility. It has nothing to do with comfort and everything to do with the basic freedom to do what you want with your own goddamn face.</p>

        <p>Just because I wouldn't get an abortion and think it's wrong, doesn't mean I think it should be illegal because people would just find a way around it. 
I don't even listen to "conservative media" I hear the news and make my own judgements and opinions. Please tell me how it makes me a conspiracy theorist to think that this is all paranoid. I'm not the one who lashes out, I've seen most of that from the maskers.</p>

        <p>I have in fact worn a mask everywhere it's been required, otherwise everything I had loved doing is gone forever so it's not a question anyway. But yes, I don't like to wear it because it's arbitrary. I have a 99.9% chance of surviving this cold. People like you have never insisted anyone wear anything like this before.

        <p>SARS CoV2 has never been isolated and proven to cause COVID-19. All papers that claims otherwise, are bogus (either they actually don’t try to purify it, described the method clearly, and no photograph shown, yes opposing academic researchers believes this too EDIT: I meant opposing researchers also believes that it never been isolated). The PCR test does not test for viral RNA. Check the original paper for yourself, or any PCR IFU.</p>

        <p>My grandparents are almost 80. They locked down for the “15 days to slow the spread” then said fuck it. They have been going to church, Costco, thanksgiving, Christmas, etc. They told me that they know their time on earth is limited, so why spend what could be their final few years isolated from loved ones? They said they’ve survived worse, after all. I respect their decision since they are ADULTS and see them regularly. They don’t appreciate being seen as some degenerate incompetent imbecile who can’t make their own decisions anymore. My grandparents are awesome.</p>

        <p>Bloody hell I can still visualize the stock image the BBC used for that article it pissed me off so much. The lady oN tHe RiGhT sIdE oF hIsToRy shushing the guy like he’s a stupid, petulant child in need of electric shock therapy to see the error of his thinking. That was before reading the article itself. </p>
<p>It’s sickening the way the media portrays free thinkers as lunatics in dire need of reconditioning. We don’t state our claims unless it’s straight from the horses mouth and we’re right everytime because THEY ARE TELLING YOU. This ain’t hokey crystal ball speculation. </p>
<p>That being said I love the change you’ve made! We don’t prove our points arrogantly when they turn out true. We wanna welcome people we want unity. The truth is the powers that be are scared shitless that we’ll grow closer to that unity via a collective awakening. Hence why we’ve been force fed so much extreme coverage since Christmas. It might not feel like it but we’re winning! They know there’s a silent majority and the first quarter of this year is the final hurdle for them to wait until they conduct their agendas. Expect more of this until at least Easter.</p>

        <p>The term “conspiracy theorist” is disingenuous and derisive, and was invented by the American “intelligence” community in order to smear the brave few journalists and whistleblowers who dared to peer behind the curtain, and deter others from attempting the same.</p>
<p>Theories, in a scientific context, are based on data that support a hypothesis. No data, no theory. People who demean “conspiracy theorists” either haven’t spent time looking for the puzzle pieces, or are prevented from doing so by their own ego.</p>
<p>To uncover the truth about reality is also to reveal the lies under which it is buried. Lies which may go back years, decades, centuries and even millennia. To realize that one has been lied to is a painful process, one for which most people do not have the time, nor the inclination.</p>

        <p>The oh-so dangerous freedom of speech also allowed for millennials to get the idea of eating tide pods. Did you advocate against free speech because of that as well? Considering you have a bitter hatred for the Bill of Rights (or at least one of them), I bet you have quite the appetite for those juicy, scrumptious little pods yourself, so I'm sure you didn't.</p>

        <p>Politicans and the most powerful in the world are fucking kids.</p>
<p>Elections from Democratic Primaries to likely Presidential electoral process were rigged.</p>
<p>New World Order seems to be a legitimate thing with the lockdowns, vaccines, and Build Back Better coming out of Davos/Gates Foundation and spreading across the Western world.</p>
<p>Videos of alien aircraft have been circulated and confirmed by multiple world power's Air Force and Navys and Israeli, Chinese, and Russian intelligence.</p>
<p>Mass surveillance at every level is more penetrating and beyond more real than even the kookiest conspiracy theorist believed.</p>
<p>It goes on. The 1990s cliche of a conspiracy theorist being some nut in a basement or a cabin surrounded by a farraday cage sending out newsletters seems almost quaint. The only things that probably aren't true are the really dumb ones just for fun: bigfoot, flat earth, etc.</p>

        <p>I was just reading the declassified FBI files on the Mcmartin case. It says right there in the files that state departments and FBI counterintelligence conspired to cover up the tunnels underneath the school. The head of the LA FBI(Ted Gunderson) even provided photos of pentagrams drawn on miscellaneous objects.</p>
<p>In other words, “satanic panic” isn’t a myth. It was a cleverly calibrated phraseology imposed on the American public to gaslight them. This is the same concept applied with the term conspiracy theorist. </p>
<p>The public school system in America is designed to produce a specific conditioned adult that I’ll refer to as “Corporate Bitch”. </p>
<p>Corporate Bitch believes the 4th estate tells true stories. Corporate Bitch denies iatrogenic diseases(doctor induced) kills 200,000 people annually. Corporate Bitch in turn calls dissenters an anti-vaxxer. </p>
<p>Don’t be like Corporate Bitch.</p>

<p>Money is true power. And these guys are all about their money and comfort. They're short-sighted. Someone would have found a way to make big bucks out of that by now, the advantage would be irresistible. </p>
<p>Plus, if a country truly had such advanced technology, they would use it to gain an unprecedented advantage over every other nation. They all want to be a superpower.</p>
<p>And It's not like humans have traditionally held back from showing off new tech asap. Look at what we did with nuclear technology.</p>

        <p>I dunno about that.  Chances are that these crafts are man made, in my opinion, but even if they were aliens I don't think that the average first worlder would care.  They're so pacified by mainstream entertainment that, if they were told that aliens actually landed and met POTUS, they'd just look at you slack-jawed and say "whoa man, that's crazy" and just go about their day scarfing chips and watching Netflix.  We're such stupid creatures now that we could find out that our politicians are run by reptiles and most of us wouldn't care, a fraction of us would be in support of the reptilians, and the few who don't trust the reptilians are called racist.</p>

As an original member.of r/wuhan_flu I saw this coming straight from the beginning and the funny thing it's wuflu subreddit was coming out with alot of information that originally the media was denying that a few weeks or months later they turned around and said it was true. Originally I thought this virus was bad. I stocked up and bought full face respirators. But after I saw the numbers and the IFR I've already gone back to my normal and amd trying to educate others. But sadly they are all sheep.</p>

        <p>Believing  we should  do more about the coronavirus back in January and February was a conspiracy back then. I remember threads where people questioned why more wasn’t done and why experts and politicians downplay the virus. Then in March the politicians did a 180 about the issue.</p>

        <p>This is a very child-like world view but you and countless others get away with it because it passes for altruism.  Imagining the emotions of having a loved one die isn't how we should be assessing the costs and benefits of our actions.  Have some foresight into the consequences of stealing away 1% of everyone's lifespans by putting them in purgatory.  Have some foresight into what you get when you condition people to give away their freedoms, to have children grow up under a system where police and corporations can do whatever they want, to have a system where most of us are serfs who pay tribute to Daddy Bezos.  And all for what?  Fewer overall deaths?  A 99.9% survival rate for anyone under age 70?  We're a hair away from deciding to never truly open back up because no one should die of a virus, which is absurd.  You're not right just because you have a soft spot in your heart for people who die.</p>

        <p>Ugh I know right? I told everybody I knew back in March that this lockdown was bull and I’d still be going to weddings without a mask on and traveling out of country. Sometimes I’ll pull a liberals mask down just to cough in their face, they’re so scared of something you can’t even see and isn’t worse than the FLU PEOPLE!! There is literally NO PROOF that if you social distance, wear a mask, or follow government mandates you won’t get the wuhan flu. I mean look at Japan, they actually had people doing all of these things and they STILL have had 0.003% of their total population die compared to our 0.11% here in ‘murica. It makes practically NO DIFFERENCE to the percent of the population dead if you have a society that can follow the most simple rules right from the get go! If masks really worked that number would be ZERO SHEEPLE!!! So what if NY or LA has to order a few more refrigerated trucks for dead bodies, I won’t have Congress infringing on mah rights trying to keep me from my favorite sports bar! This is all about control, next thing you know those demoRATS will be wanting to take our guns and turn our kids gay! Give an inch they take a mile, I always say.  #shedthemask right?</p>

        <p>Oh my bad, I just was trying to be inclusive and was going off of some of the general themes I saw in this subreddit. You’re right, this has nothing to do with masks, social distancing or lockdowns. It’s just the government wanting to control us through fearmongoring. Should I talk about how some celebrities might be robots instead?</p>

<p>Of course not - you "people" cannot even call Joe fucking Biden out on his absurd December COVID prediction being massive doomer fear porn, or how the media fellates Dem mayors and governors for their "leadership" amidst much higher death rates.</p>

&rt;how the media fellates Dem mayors and governors for their "leadership" amidst much higher death rates.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden is a joke, but Blue states tend to have a higher population density.  Higher population = more chances for viral transmission.  </p>
<p>There's undoubtedly fuckery afoot, but that bit does fit their story at least.  </p>
<p>This kind of virus really is perfect for manufacturing consent.  Back when it started if you asked if a doomer had met anyone who had it, they could just say, 'no, that means the lockdown  is working.'  Now when places that impose stricter restrictions don't see much change in death rates, well that's just how the virus works.  </p>
<p>The part that doesn't line up is the vaccine.  When everything started, before it became politicised, medical professionals said late 2021 would be the soonest we might see a vaccine, and even that would be a feat in vaccine development.  Now it's here a year early? Get the fuck out here.  This tells me one of 3 things.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is no virus.  The vaccine is at best a saline solution, at worst, well shit, God only knows the worst way coercing the general public into a medically unnecessary could play out.
(Doubt it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They've had plenty of time to develop a vaccine becauses they started working on it before the virus was unleashed on the general public.  Depending on how long they've had and the scope of their studies, they might even be administering earlier, less effective versions of the vaccine right now for plausible deniability.<br>
(I think this one most likely to some degree.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They put a rush order on the vaccine and them science boys came thru.  It ain't perfect yet, but it's the best we got.  Sure anyone getting it now is pretty much a human Guinea pig, but Ticket Master is requiring vaccination for entry to their venues, so you know....
(What MSM would like us to believe)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any one of these things could be true, and either way I'll be putting off getting vaccinated for as long as possible.  That's not the only reason either.   My reason for avoiding vaccine is much simpler and more personal.  I fucking HATE needles.  I'm like Goku with that shit.</p>

        <p>Who exactly do you want to call out Biden for being wrong? COVID has been worse in denser cities, urban areas are usually more left-leaning but red states are catching up.</p>
