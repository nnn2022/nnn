    <strong>What is Cuomo doing?</strong>
    <p><p>Can someone explain what is he doing? Is he deliberately killing people to inflate cases?</p></p>

        <p>If you listen to the No Agenda Show episode 1320, they go into detail about the investment groups (that backed Cumoâ€™s election as Gov) that own the particular nursing homes these patients were sent back to and how everyone made money off of it. I think maybe around $32000 per death.</p>

        <p>You need to have the full context in order to get an idea of what is going on in New York, and with Cuomo. </p>
<p>In a nutshell, during the height of the SCAMdemic, last year, around this time, he was on television every day trying to look "presidential" and doing "corona virus briefings." He kept complaining to President Trump that New York State needs help. In about March/April, Cuomo, began to send people who were sick into the nursing homes. From my understanding, he made it illegal to not accept sick elderly people into nursing homes. What was the result? Many elderly people got sick and died because, for what ever reason, the elderly that they admitted into the elderly nursing facilities were sick with some disease. People were calling this out, but it went to death ears in the mainstream media and State government.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind this went on for several months. In about August or so, President Trump got wind that Cuomo was not being honest about the amount of elderly that died. In other words, they under-reported the amount of elderly that died. So President Trump had started an investigation of Cuomo's handling of the elderly that died. Cuomo, then decides he is not going to cooperate with the investigation until sometime after the election. Keep in mind, the media is glorifying Cuomo, his briefings, he writes a book on leadership, he's getting interviewed, and every one under the sun is singing his tune all the while, he is exposed for sending sick elderly people to nursing homes, and they end up infecting more people. What does Cuomo do? He down plays it, and says it is just a conspiracy theory and political attack against him. </p>
<p>Fast forward to about last month or so, and his Attorney General issues a scathing report that Cuomo's administration under reported the amount of elderly people that died in the nursing homes by about 50%. So, instead of 6000 elderly people dying, it is more like 14 thousand that died. I would probably put the death toll probably higher, but that is my opinion.</p>
<p>So our friend Cuomo, now that he has been exposed for what he did is deflecting blame. He says, he accepts "some responsibility" but I really wish he told that to the faces of the families of the elderly that died. </p>
<p>So, your question, what is Cuomo doing? Well, he is doing everything in his power to put this on his staff, claim "he didn't know" and deflect as much possible. </p>
<p>Eventually this will catch up to him and either in this life, the afterlife or both, he is going to have to account for his actions. And what excuse can he say? That, "I was just doing my job" or that, "I was just doing what I was told" or that "I was just following the law?" Like David Icke once said, "all the bloody best with that conversation!" The Nuremberg Defense / Excuse is not a defense!</p>
