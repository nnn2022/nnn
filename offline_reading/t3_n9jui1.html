        <p>Yep, my guess is that they reacted the way they did because it was <em>supposed</em> to be exactly as deadly as they were treating it as, but it didn‚Äôt take them long to realize that what got out was a version that was incomplete‚Äîso incomplete that it was basically just the flu.</p>
<p>Then, they realized they could take their lemons and make lemonade; they decided to keep going with hyping up COVID because they could use the leak to their advantage, kickstarting their nefarious agenda a bit earlier than they had originally planned.</p>

        <p>Of course I am. If I thought I had any proof besides my own intuition on this, it wouldn‚Äôt just be ‚Äúmy guess.‚Äù</p>
<p>It‚Äôs equally plausible that the whole thing was engineered from the start, and there was no oopsie in it getting out of the lab. </p>

        <p>Did you make this!? This is TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO funny!</p>
<p>In Jan 2020, the RsearchGate community was already speculating that someone had turned Wuhan into Racoon City, and by "someone" we meant the WIV (aka, The Hive). On 31 Jan 2020, there was already a paper from India showing that the T-virus had been given HIV powers:  <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1">Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag | bioRxiv</a></p>
<p>The paper was retracted months later after #stopsinophobia became the ruse with which the CCP was able to do serious damage control and demonise anyone who questioned the narrative. The fact that there has NEVER been an intermediary host species (pangolin, snake, bat, etc) shown is all the evidence that we need that this was a DELIBERATE leak.</p>
<p>OMW: I just remembered that they once claimed that it may have been a snake!!! LOL!!!</p>

<p>They also didn't need a deadlier virus if they had a helpful propaganda apparatus and compliant world leaders.</p>
