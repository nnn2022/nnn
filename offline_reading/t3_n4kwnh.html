        <p>This is from a clinical trial before vaccines became commonplace. What you cited is basically saying 'This is a clinical trial. People are considered to be exposed to this trial by coming into contact with a participant.' That is literally it. I guarantee you this verbiage is likely found in numerous other clinical trials for multiple pharmaceuticals. This does not mean people are contagious after becoming a participant, nor does this suffice as an example the OP is looking for. You'd think if this actually meant people are contagious after receiving a vaccine, there would be an entire study you could quote here, rather than 2 sentences from a 146 page clinical trial.</p>

        <p>Its based on the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, which this clinical trial helped prove to be safe and effective. I guaranteed the verbiage outlining who is considered to be exposed to a clinical trial is indeed included in other clinical trials, not anything other than that. Also, nowhere in this, or any other Covid vaccine trial does it ever talk about a side effect of shedding one's skin.</p>

        <p>They’re still conducting trials which aren’t due to finish until 2023, why do you think they’re only Emergency Use Authorisation and not FDA approved? https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/four-people-oregon-who-received-both-doses-vaccine-test-positive-n1257886</p>

<p>If you think shedding is relating to skin falling off than you truly are misinformed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding</p>

        <p>There are also about 100 doctors and nurses but I guess you missed that part. Also reactions from people that have been vaccinated I hate to tell you, those people aren’t anti vax ers and their reactions are real. If they didn’t post about them you would never know because the media doesn’t you to as it’s advertising is paid for by big pharma. I guess it’s only ok to hear about Covid deaths from Facebook? Either way if you are going to dismiss all of this as a coincidence you are already too far gone</p>

        <p>Even if they would not be safe, it would make no sense for the side effects to be contagious. But if you are <em>that</em> scared, then at least you will finally have a reason to respect social distancing, so its win win :)</p>

        <p>First of all, the actual definition of several, you know, from the dictionary, is "more than two but not many." I think three fits that definition wonderfully.</p>
<p>Second, you are experiencing cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is when you blatantly ignore facts while trying to only look at sources which confirm a preexisting belief. When scientists do research, they cannot simply ignore facts contrary to how they would like their research to go. Like I can't just be like "people of Reddit, give me information on how gravity is actually not real" while subsequently jumping up and coming back down and just pretending that just didn't happen. I am providing you with factual information that is contrary to what you want to discover, therefore you cannot dismiss what I post without being cognitively dissonant :)</p>

        <p>I apologize for the several thing, always learn something new. </p>
<p>Regarding science, science when it comes to vaccines and viruses exact, and when it comes to experimental vaccines 8m sure there's something to learn. </p>
<p>Remember the scientists are always right...</p>
<p>What's your point? That everything you read in science magazine is the ultimate truth? Do you believe what Fauci say 100%? If is not in mainstream is not truth and everything the mainstream say is truth? </p>
<p>Would you mind sharing your credentials, since apparently you're here to educate us?</p>

        <p>My point is that I trust mainstream, international, peer reviewed science over a right-wing echo chamber such as this one. I believe Fauci 100%. Why would a doctor work as a virologist his entire life just to trick some people into wearing a mask. I sincerely do not understand how you lot think this is some huge manipulation. For what? Its a fucking mask! If anything, it makes you more obscure for government surveillance, as it obscures your face from cameras! You don't need credentials to explain or understand that.</p>

        <p>There are quiet a few scientific studies proving that masks are ineffective and harmful. All the boxes from the masks say that they don't prevent viruses. </p>
<p>Sweden didn't have and don't have masks, they don't have it because their scientists decided based on their evidence. </p>
<p>States in the USA that didn't have restrictions aren't doing worst than ones they did? How you explain that?</p>
<p>Peer reviewed doesn't mean is 100% accurate and accurate studies not always make it to peer reviewed if you're interested in the subject you can research otherwise I can help you.</p>

        <p>So the best you can come up with is "quite a few" but you can't even provide one study.</p>
<p>I'm not going to fact check you because I'm getting tired of this debate, but maybe if you just compared the numbers of infections/deaths of states with no covid response to those with a high response, such as say Missouri vs California, it would be obvious California would have a much higher instance of infection/death because the population is orders of magnitude larger than Missouri. That's not hard to conceptualize. </p>
<p>Also, heres a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-23/swedish-face-mask-skepticism-fades-as-infection-rates-rise">bloomberg</a> link detailing how Swedish officials are backtracking on mask usage.</p>
<p>Peer reviewed does indeed not mean 100% accurate, but its better than info available on Facebook and echo chambers like this one!</p>

For it to be considered peer reviewed, it must be published by some credible academic journal such as the American Journal of Clinical Pathology or something like that.</p>

        <p>So let me get this straight, you dont want to believe that the virus is contagious, you refuse to wear masks or take any precaution to stop spreading it, but you are scared that <em>the vaccine might be contagious</em>? The existence of this subreddit makes me lose hope in humanity.</p>
<p>For your interest, no, even if someone gets side effects from the vaccine (serious side effects are very rare anyway), it would make no sense for them to cause side effects for others. The side effects are your body reacting to a foreign substance, so they cant spread to other people.</p>
