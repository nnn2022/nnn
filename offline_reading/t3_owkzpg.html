    <strong>Vaccinated Persons for Informed Consent</strong>
    <p><p>Hello! If you're vaccinated and realize that the concept of forcing it<br>
 on people is insane, please speak up! The situation is beyond dire. We<br>
 are careening into the stuff of nightmares. The rise, or rather, the<br>
 unveiling of a new brand of totalitarianism, the likes of which<br>
 humanity has experienced nothing remotely close to. If you’re<br>
 vaccinated and you’re here -- step out at speak up! If you’ve<br>
 considered the information we share and still chose to get vaccinated,<br>
 FANTASTIC! It’s YOUR choice! Please use your status and do the right<br>
 thing. This is an internet forum frequented predominately by American<br>
 citizens, and America is the last bastion. Recognize that your<br>
 complicity is on the fast track to very possibly becoming a partial<br>
 cause of civil war, internment, genocide, and a host of other horrors.<br>
 Please, someone who is vaccinated and still cares, organize others<br>
 like you and ACT.  </p>
<p>I close with a blurb and quote that is of the highest possible<br>
 relevance in the zeitgeist.  </p>
<p>“Martin Niemöller (1892–1984) was a prominent Lutheran pastor in<br>
 Germany. He emerged as an outspoken public foe of Adolf Hitler and<br>
 spent the last seven years of Nazi rule in concentration camps. He is<br>
 perhaps best remembered for his postwar words,  </p>
<p>First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I<br>
 was not a socialist.  </p>
<p>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—<br>
 because I was not a trade unionist.  </p>
<p>Then they came for the jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a jew.  </p>
<p>Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.“</p></p>
