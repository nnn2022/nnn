    <strong>All of the rules and regulations are getting so old</strong>
    <p><p>I work at a clinic, and when people aren’t yelling at me on the phone or at the front desk over COVID, I have to “greet” patients as they come through the door, asking 20 questions about if the have COVID symptoms. Company wide rules say that patients can’t have any visitors unless they are a minor or need physical assistance. We have a signs outside our office that say, “No shoes, No mask, no service.” We’re told five million different things every day that contradict each other, and no one questions it! This will never be a “New Normal”, and I refuse to adhere to this crap! I feel like I’m going insane! I know this can’t last forever, and I’ve noticed more and more people are becoming defiant, but holy crap it’s August, and it has worn out it’s welcome. Well for me it was never welcome in the first place! </p>
<p>A man with cerebral palsy came in the other day. I was checking him in for his appointment, and I noticed he was having trouble keep his mask up while he was talking to me. This poor guy was then chewed out by the patient behind him, reprimanding him that he needs to wear his mask properly or he is going to get everyone sick. I’ve never rolled my eyes so hard. I felt so bad for the guy. But no one else batted an eye, they praised the guy for obnoxiously policing how that guy wore his mask. </p>
<p>I’m greeter today, and I have been scolded for letting visitors through. 3 months ago me would have talked back to them, but now I’ve stopped caring. I’m sorry if this post seems a bit all over the place, I just had to rant. This whole thing is ridiculous, and I’m tired. Too tired to sit here for 9 hours to enforce rules I never agreed with in the first place, and tired of everyone’s delicate sensibilities.</p></p>

        <p>No joke, that is what living in some cities in China feels like. There are a lot of pointless rules targeting a continually evolving roster of enemies. Normal people have learned to ignore them.</p>

        <p>I suggest you read up on Agenda 21/2030, <a href="https://i.ibb.co/y8GMKBN/117593903-3195685167215109-6830326535453418524-n.jpg">Rockefeller's Lock Step</a>, Event 201 and The Great Reset. It's going to get a lot worse.</p>
<p>'LOCK STEP – A world of tighter top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership, with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback', starts on p. 18. All the scenarios are well worth the read, as they clearly illustrate how the controllers think and what they wish for in the future.</p>

        <p>It’s such vicious scapegoating. It’s shocking how abusive so many people are. Either they are incapable of empathy, dissociated, or believe they are entitled to greater forgiveness than they could ever deserve.</p>

        <p>Yeah I was just thinking today how fucking sick I am of thinking about my every move in public because I don’t want anyone to screech at me for being a human being and maybe wanting to leave my house without having to consider my every goddamn move. My city doesn’t feel too screechy. In general people seem tired as hell of this but also don’t want to cross the wrong Karen in all of it.</p>
