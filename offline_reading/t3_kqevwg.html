<title>Freddie Sayers: Sounds like we are to go from 78% of the country to 100% in tier 4 lockdown, with schools also closed. But if that doesn't work to stop the alarming increase... then what?</title>

        <p>I lost faith in Freddie. He started digressing into unrelated topics and weakened his position into washy centrism. Last I saw he had a swedish "expert" on advocating for restrictions. Early unherd was good but the game is up</p>

        <p>He's exposing people to different points of view. I like what Unherd is doing from what I've seen of it. I think the biggest thing lacking is open and transparent public debate on what is going on. Unfortunately in the MSM only one side is allowed to voice any opposition except for very rare corners, e.g. Tucker Carlson.</p>

        <p>I used to think just like you. Then I realized people who refuse to stake out with a position and are open-minded to the point of fault in their airtime actually aren't helping us. Their messaging isn't reaching the far left, it's reaching conservatives and telling them to moderate and get taken advantage of in the process.</p>
<p>And then they'll bring in grifters who were ejected from the left and claim to be conservatives, who actually just try to sell a watered down version of what was first said because they don't believe it. That's people like Brett Weinstein. They'll bring out political shapeshifters like Charlie Kirk to redefine this message into something meaningless, because their real loyalty is to the old conservatism of the rich.</p>
<p>And time after time, the open-minded free thinking centrist club will give ground to a hard left that doesn't care about discussion, openmindedness, freedom or democracy. And it's a lot like appeasement, because in the end the shadow of populism which gave them power will have been erased and that'll be the end.</p>
