    <strong>Call Me Crazy But I'd Rather Risk A Cold Than A Blood Clot</strong>
    <p><p>Not much else to say really. Fuck the vaccine and fuck anyone that will try to force or coerce me into getting it. I would much rather have someone with Covid sneeze directly in my face than have that fucking experimental cocktail of pain and misery plunged into my body. Sex on the beach? More like seizure on the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>Oh, and before you fucking come in here claiming "cOvId cAuSeS bLoOd cLoTs tOo!!", I highly fucking doubt it for one thing, as that bullshit only came out after the J&amp;J shot shat the bed, and furthermore the chances of me catching Covid are fucking very unlikely considering it's been a year and I barely know anyone that's had it, whereas if I get the vaccine I've obviously got the fucking thing and there's no turning back. They can't fucking suck it out of me like snake poison, once it's in there, it's fucking in there.</p>
<p>I'm not going to potentially risk my life with a Christmas-rushed, buggy-as-fuck, untested beta level version game of a vaccine with annual booster shot DLC for a (fuck me I'm getting tired of typing this sentence out over and over again) MEME VIRUS WITH A RIDICULOUSLY HIGH SURVIVAL RATE OF 99.7%. No fucking way, not happening, you couldn't fucking pay me to take it. End of.</p></p>

        <p>My brother in law had body aches and joint pain for weeks after the jab. He already had covid before but since he “follows the science” he’s gleefully jumping off a bridge with his favorite lords of the lab. He thinks the body aches were proof of his body responding to the jab. People have become so brainwashed by pharma that they believe your body imploding on itself after a toxic jab- is a good thing.</p>

        <p>If these demonic betas see a cat sneeze, they will blame it on whatever mutation number they're on.</p>
<p>If the blood clot injections also happen to cause the body to over-react upon re-infection, I think they absolutely will blame it on "some new variant of CovidReee!!".</p>

        <p>It does not mimic infection. There is a lot to be said for the fact that it does not enter via the respiratory route. It’s not the same to inject respiratory viruses into the blood. The immune response is going to be different and offer uniquely subpar protection. For example, you may notice that the previously infected individuals do not spread covid. Vaccinated individuals do spread covid. Because the upper respiratory system of vaccinated individuals will not be prepared for Covid. The vaccine may stop progression but not infection or spread.</p>

        <p>It creates a synthetic covid spike which to the immune system is a real infection.</p>
<p>The immune system kills the covid spikes and believes its fully under attack.</p>
<p>Once the vaccine leaves the body after 3 days. The immune system has now remembered how to kill a covid infection.</p>
<p>"Because the covid spike mimics covid." </p>
<p>Previously infected or vaccinated individuals both can spread covid, this is factual. </p>
<p>So I think you need to do some more reading.</p>

        <p>I read the information. I read the scientific literature. I also read the “peer reviewed NYT.” I even read the propaganda.</p>
<p>The vaccine creates nothing. No synthetic covid spike is created by the vaccine. Instead, the vaccine contains genetic material which hitches a ride with some synthetic compounds to enter your cell. Then your own cell begins to make spike proteins. That might not be a good idea. It might be fine though. We shall see when the FDA finishes the approval process (or revokes EUA). I hope for the best.</p>
<p>3 days that’s it? and like magic it’s gone? Well, maybe. This is why we are still conducting studies to see how things will turn out. </p>
<p>“has now remembered how to kill a covid infection” - No. It now knows how to attack just the Covid spike. </p>
<p>Covid-19 is a disease brought on by what starts as a respiratory infection with Sars-Cov-2. The infection begins in upper respiratory tract. Injected Vaccine does not mimic this very well and will not elicit the same immune response in the same vital areas (upper respiratory). </p>
<p>To use your terminology: the Covid spike does not mimic covid. It mimics part of the covid - just the covid spike. And definitely does not mimic the upper respiratory transmission pathway. The previous sentence is vital.</p>

        <p>The vaccine does not create a synthetic covid spike. The vaccine merely contains instructions so that your cells may do so if they wish (they usually do - which is why the efficacy data is looking very good).</p>
<p>Just in case you may have identified me as being an antivaxxer because I questioned what you may have read in the latest propaganda: I like vaccines. They are mostly peaceful. I will not pretend they are perfect. Neither should anyone else. I also won’t pretend these are FDA approved. Neither should anyone else. </p>
<p>After rereading our comments a few times, it seems we could be trying to say the same thing here just speaking to different audiences. I think you are saying the sun makes plants grow and i’m saying it’s photosynthesis.</p>

        <p>They have a police officer on standby at my local Covid vaccination centre. </p>
<p>And it's easy to see why, many Branch Covidians argue angrily over having their second dose scheduled, getting to the front of the queue etc. If someone sees a close relative collapse immediately after the vaccine, they may need the police to restrain them.</p>
<p>Blood clots are just the beginning: There are some reports of limbs being amputated as a consequence of 'Covid treatment'.</p>

        <p>I KNOW!!! I heard of men having testicular regression syndrome a mere 15 minutes after getting their first shot of the vaccine and changing sex by the time they got the second shot. There are 50yo men going through their first menstruation out there because of the vaccine. shm</p>

        <p>I’ll help, I work at a hospital, I’m not vaccinated and you would be surprised how many intelligent professionals in the medical field are refusing the vaccine. Obviously this is anecdotal because they don’t have a lot of studies about HIPA sensitive information available but I am telling you as a person with boots on the ground so to speak.</p>

        <p>Your welcome. Glad to help. We need to show people just how well educated professionals are hesitant about this "vaccine." We need to show them that science isn't something that's just settled, that it's ever evolving and growing. A long time ago people said the science was settled that the sun revolved around the earth, look how it turned out for them.</p>

        <p>Back during the Spanish flu, before medical ethics was a thing, they ran experiments where healthy volunteers chatted with flu sufferers and even directly inhaled their coughs and sneezes. None of the volunteers caught the flu. These illnesses are not what we've been sold for over a century.</p>

        <p>The government is part of it, sure, but it's not the civil service or even the politicians running the show, it's who they ultimately answer to. The private entities behind the banks and corporations. Sickness and death has always had a high return on investment.</p>

        <p>Genuine question then:<br>
Chicken pox was around for a hell of a long time, and basically everyone would have gotten it once and then gain immunity to it. Once the vaccine for it was developed and used, chicken pox infections basically became history. I don't know anyone personally who's gotten chicken pox during the 21st century, and this coincides with the vaccine being used in mass. Since vaccines work according to germ theory and not terrain theory, what explains this coincidental downfall of the pox when the vaccine started being used?</p>

        <p>It's so frustrating, especially since my wife and I both had whatever this is. I was stupid sick, she got it less. Took 6 weeks to feel myself again. I agree, it sucked. That was in Jan 2020.</p>
<p>Never once did I ask anyone to do anything special then or since. I surely didn't look anyone to blame or cry about because I got sick. It was simply my turn. I survived it just like I survived crowded Florida traffic today with idiots in every direction.</p>

        <p>I had this discussion with my brother who wants the vaccine. I said I'd rather take my chances with Covid, I'm young, healthy, I think I should be just fine. However shit like blood clots, bells palsy, that stuff scares me more. He talked about possible long term effects of Covid, I talked about possible long term effects of an untested mRNA vaccine on the immune system. A lot is unknown on both sides but to me, I just have to weigh my own risks.</p>

        <p>Survival statistics are averages that include millions of unhealthy degenerates, obese people, diabetics etc. Insulin resistance is probably the primary biomarker for poor immune response. The actual odds for a healthy person who eats a species appropriate diet and is athletic and at a good body composition, is basically zero. In fact I would wager that not a single such person has died to covid. The paradox is that the people most in need of vaccines (fat degenerates) are those on whom vaccines are least effective. The take away should be that working on one's personal health is far better than this culture of worshipping pharma drugs.</p>

        <p>&rt;However shit like blood clots, bells palsy, that stuff scares me more</p>
<p>Well that shit happenes with Covid more frequently so your argument doesn't make much sense from that point of view.</p>
<p>&rt;He talked about possible long term effects of Covid, I talked about possible long term effects of an untested mRNA vaccine on the immune system</p>
<p>There is a difference. Long term effects of Covid have been documented and confirmed while those of vaccine no, so they are at best just blind speculation since there is neither proof of it nor any theoretical explanation or indication of it.</p>
<p>&rt;A lot is unknown on both sides but to me, I just have to weigh my own risks.</p>
<p>That is of course true, but from what is known and familiar, getting Covid seems riskier even for young and healthy people. That is just what statistics shows so not my opinion.</p>

        <p>You have to catch covid, which is unlikely since many cases are just the flu. With a vaccine you are volunteering yourself for infection. You seem to just gloss over that. A healthy person is overall unlikely to catch covid and if they do the virus will likely be asymptomatic. I have been going outside every day without using those stupid sanitizers, for over a year now, and I haven't been sick for many years. Weak frail people always project their fragility onto others.</p>

Getting hard for me to tremble in fear anymore about the long term effects when the short term effects are such a damn joke. You forgot to throw in the asymptotic crap that has been proven false.

<p>I don't think it shows that. You should have looked more carefully, and since it is reasonable to assume that in the long run everyone or almost everyone would come into contact with the virus and long term rate of infection really is almost 100% unless you violently isolate for time immemorial, you should have looked for graphs that show rate of infection of 100%. It seems tha it is still more reasonable to vaccinate even if you are below 30. </p>

<p>Blood clots in the brain sound scarier than a cold or mild flu....  my mind is probably the only redeeming thing about me - I’m almost 33, mildly disabled with weak muscles and balance, unemployed, asymmetrical jaw, and my mind is the only thing I have. I am terrified of losing it. Nothing worse than brain damage but especially if the person used to be really intelligent </p>
<p>I can’t believe I am going to be bullied into this by my family which l live with because my disability is metabolic and I got really sick one year from the flu so I have to get regular flu shots..... and in Canada if that leaked email is real then they are going to force me to play along or be detained in Covid facilities until I comply and give up all assets ... being potentially bullied by the state sucks</p>

        <p>I'll take that 0.003% chance that it'll kill me. Anyone I spread it to that could conceivably have an extreme reaction to has either been vaccinated and therefore has ample protection against the virus or should just stay indoors if they're that worried.</p>

        <p>Well that's their intended purpose and the argument made for people to get one but there's little to no reason for me to get one as I'm already protected by my immune system.</p>
<p>Arguing that I need to get vaccinated to protect someone that's already had the vaccine, not to mention demanding that we carry on wearing masks and social distancing, is basically admitting that the vaccine is useless.</p>

        <p>Well then they've made their choice and accepted the consequences. They knew the risk, however minute, and decided that they'd take it.</p>
<p>Don't know why you're resorting to name-calling and insults when I've patiently answered all your retarded questions in a polite manner. Is it because you have no leg to stand on or can you just not adequately articulate your feeble, sponge brained thoughts and shit them out into a coherent argument that might actually go beyond "nOt eVErYOne iS vAcCiNaTeD"?</p>

        <p>Because they aren't? I don't believe this sub but these people say "oMG nOt eVEN hALf Of aMeRIca is vAcCInaTed!!1!" And I'm pretty sure most of the people here aren't unvaccinated too. There's still always the minute risk of getting the virus even after being vaccinated and you must still be careful. The vaccine isn't completely eradicated, and the practices of social distancing and masking etc must still be followed until the threat is near to or completely neutralized.</p>

        <p>No, and neither are you. In the end both of us are entitled to our own opinions and you are free to do as you please, however I still know that the risk of covid is low but still there and I will protect myself while I can. I too hate masks and the lockdown and social distancing but I know its necessary. The worst part is if you get the virus you spread it to others.</p>

        <p>It’s not just about you getting sick. it’s about eradicating the illness. Eradication of an illness can only happen with mass vaccinations. Just look at Tuberculosis. It’s an air borne disease that was so prevalent many years ago. But eventually people developed immunity through vaccination. This entire subs premise is built around getting back to normal. But that cannot possibly happen unless everyone is immunised from the virus. Tuberculosis has a 3% mortality rate. Yet it’s a part of the national vaccination programme for most countries. So are you gonna say that you won’t be getting a TB vaccine before you travel to a country that has TB just because it has a low mortality rate? Idiots</p>

        <p>I don’t understand why everyone is giving a fuck about blood clots now. Women have been taking birth control pills for decades and they have a higher risk of blood clots yet it’s expected of them! Suddenly a shot has a small risk of blood clots and all the men are up in arms 😂</p>

        <p>The pill protects me extremely well from getting pregnant with a whole ass child. I would most likely get pregnant without it and do not want that. I have chosen to take it and was not coerced or bribed to do so. </p>
<p>The vaccine allegedly would protect me from getting severely ill, however the chances of that are so slim already WITHOUT it, that the risks of the vaccine need to be considered for someone like me. When you statistically have a 100% chance of being fine from a virus, subjecting yourself to something that is experimental and is indiscriminately affecting people very negatively, I believe that is a really poor health decision.</p>

        <p>Lolll I love it, exactly my thinking. </p>
<p>I have regular sex with my partner, so chance of pregnancy is real (and not wanted at this time for me) the risks of the BC side effects are outweighed by the benefits (not getting pregnant right now).</p>
<p>But the chance of getting covid, I think, is so slim. I live in Florida and have been doing “the most” for the last year and haven’t come across it, only a few friends have had it and they got over it quickly. I’m a healthy 28 year old. The risks of the vaccine however, outweigh any benefits, which from what I understand are NONE. </p>
<p>Seriously, what are the benefits of this so-called vaccine? If I get covid I would be fine, if I get the vaccine, I would be fine-r? The vaccine doesn’t prevent me from getting it, or giving it to someone, nor does it grant me any freedoms like removing my mask. So why bother? There are no benefits, but plenty of risks.</p>

        <p>Ha ha and theres women who won't take certain birth control for this very reason. Unfortunately alot of women dont even know that's a possible side effect.  Especially if they are smokers the numbers go way up.</p>

        <p>Follow the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/blood-clots-and-the-johnson-johnson-vaccine-what-we-know-so-far/">science</a>.</p>
<p>Skip to  "<strong>How are these blood clots different from other blood clots?</strong> "</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Blood clots are formed by platelets, which bind together to form a clot, and typically a lot of them are needed to do that. The clots seen with the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine formed even in patients who had low platelet counts in their bloodstream. That combination is unusual. Typically, when you have really low platelet counts—a condition called thrombocytopenia—you actually have problems with being able to form clots, and you can develop ongoing bleeding that is hard to stop. Furthermore, we’re seeing this phenomenon of clots forming in serious places such as the brain, the lungs, the legs or the abdomen, despite the fact that platelet counts are really low. That’s a very unique phenomenon. The closest thing we’ve seen is a rare condition called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). [<em>Editor’s note: HIT Is a condition in which the anticoagulant medication heparin lowers platelet counts. It increases the risk that blood clots will develop—a condition known as heparin-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or HITT.</em>] We have also seen a similar type of phenomenon with the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p>
