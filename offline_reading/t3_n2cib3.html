        <p>I’ve listened to him for a few years, he does a nightly radio show out of Portland, Oregon. He’s always been a skeptic and while he does cover the paranormal, ghosts, etc. he covers many political, conspiracy theory, and current event topics. I’ve listened to him a lot during this pandemic and he seems to at least cover some aspect that I see most people complaining or concerned about on this sub (freedoms, vaccines, lockdowns, errors about government overreach, censorship) So I think everyone would enjoy his nightly program and monologues. I’ll probably be sharing more in the future but just in case anyone was looking for someone to listen to that doesn’t push the same mainstream garbage BS.</p>

        <p>I started listening to him 5 years ago as he had a lot of UFO paranormal topics.   He even claims to have seen a family of Bigfoot’s once however he forgot his phone so he couldn’t take the coveted pic lol.   He does question the media narratives on covjd</p>

        <p>Yeah. Sometimes as with anyone, there’s some off the rails stuff. But his Covid talk has aligned with what I’ve seen and perceived as going on. So he’s just someone nice to listen to nightly that doesn’t push vaccines or parrot the mainstream.</p>
