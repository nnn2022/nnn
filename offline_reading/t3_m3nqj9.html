    <strong>My experience dealing with imhumane nursing home restrictions</strong>
    <p><p>Flashback to March of 2020 when my state closed all nursing homes to any visits. My mamaw, who was 86 at the time was in a really nice assisted living facility because she had Dementia. She was a lively, happy and fiesty woman her whole life even in her last year. We were unable to see her in person for months during the inhumane lockdowns. They canceled all of the units activities and church. They took away any resemblance of normalcy for the residents. Keep in mind that she was in a memory care unit and all of the residents had either dementia or alzheimers. They thrive on keeping in touch with others and having activities that can stimulate thinking and creativity (like painting and crafts and music). It was devastating to everyone in the unit.</p>
<p>Fast forward to August of 2020 and my mom gets a phone call saying that my mamaw broke her hip. She would have to move to a skilled nursing facility because they couldn't take care of her at her current unit. The doctor said she was at a major risk of dying during hip repair surgery due to her underlying heart problems. Miraculously she made it though and still remembered me and our family when we FaceTimed her. She survived for three more weeks until we got a call that she was having a gastric bleed and her vitals were going badly quickly. We got to visit her inside the unit to say our goodbyes. The thing that was so insane to me was that the nursing home made us wear hazmat suits, a huge face shield and N95 mask that made us unrecognizable to her. She was dying NOT from covid but from her battle with dementia and ailments that followed that.  Even when we were in her own private room we couldn't take off our PPE  that not ONE of of staff were even wearing. I tried taking off my massive faceshield so she could see my face and give her a hug but the nurse (who wasn't wearing one) immediately came in saying I MUST keep it up. I felt so extremely overwhelmed with emotion and anger. The government had kept me away from my precious mamaw for the last 5 months of her life until she's on her literal death bed. Then, your mamaw is unable to see that it's even you under all the gear. It's a huge slap in the face to anyone who has family in these facilities. These elderly people are forgotten about far too often. COVID IS NOT the leading reason why these old people are dying. And the government is literally able to isolate them for months on end, with little to no communication with others. I still get really upset thinking about my experience with how I got to say goodbye to my mamaw. It felt like a dystopia. I assure you if these politicians who set up the rules had to go through something like that, they would IMMEDIATELY change their rules. I just wanted to tell someone my story and if anyone is going through something similar,  I'm so sorry. üò∞üò∞</p></p>

        <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8777661/Elderly-prefer-death-spending-Christmas-without-family-ageing-expert-warns.html">Elderly people said they‚Äôd rather die of the ‚Äòvid than be isolated from family.</a></p>
<p>As it turns out, old people tend to not sit around worrying about dying. Something happens to your psyche as you age, and you just stop fearing death. I doubt you could find one single person who is actually threatened by the virus who is particularly concerned about it. Most of them will say things such as, ‚Äúwhen the Lord is ready to take me, I‚Äôm ready to go.‚Äù</p>
<p>Instead of abiding by their wishes, we are effectively torturing old people to death. No doubt many of them are dying of loneliness (yes, that happens to old people), and then they‚Äôre just recording their deaths as ‚ÄúCOVID NINETEEN,‚Äù because they had ‚Äúshortness of breath‚Äù before dying.</p>

        <p>My 100 year old grandma has been loced up in solitary confinement since last April. They did wheel her out so we could look at her for her 100th birthday. I drove 1200 miles to look at her from 100 feet away, couldn't touch her or even talk to her. My father in law is in the same situation.
I am not religious but I believe in karma and this shit will come back and bite people in the ass someday.</p>

        <p>Wow, 100 years old is spectacular. She must be a very resilient woman! I'm so sad that she's being isolated in that way, to make it to live such a long life and then get your world turned upside down due to ridiculous rules must be so tragic. üíîüíî</p>

        <p>yes my grandpa passed away in a nursing home during COVID and my grandma is still there with dementia/alzheimer's. My Grandpa was allowed guests at his death bed (not a COVID related death) but these guests also needed to be in hazmat suits, goggles, and masks and were limited to one person at a time. Only two people from my entire family are allowed to visit my grandma (they are registered and nobody else can go see her) and they need to be fully suited up and look like they're about to perform surgery, not visit their very old mother. It disgusts me. It's cruel.</p>

        <p>As if handling a loved ones death isn't hard enough, the circumstances were so harsh and cruel I felt like I was in an alternate universe. It's sickening. I'm sorry you're dealing with this too, just know you're not alone and there's lots of people done with new reality they are trying to enforce.</p>

        <p>My story is very similar to yours.  In my case it was my mother, but also 86 and suffering from dementia.  She died in July with complications from pneumonia (she just kept getting hit with that) in a nursing home.  We weren't allowed to visit her during her last few months, but we were told she had lucid moments pretty much every day.  Instead, we were given the option to do a Zoom call with her, through a window.  So us outside, and Mom in her room on the other side of the window.  My mom <strong>hated</strong> people always staring at their phones, so this 'solution' probably was worse than not visiting her at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm bitter.  My mom <em>loved</em> her family, and she probably thought we abandoned her, which I guess we did because we had to.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your story and I'm sorry for your loss.</p>

        <p>It's truly a shame that we have to share a similar experience. Im sure you know that the grief comes in waves, I really miss her because she was such a joyful person even in the midst of her dementia. She always would tell me how much she loved me and that she was proud of me. Even though it hurts,  we are Christian so I know she is in no more pain now and have faith she is happy and free. ‚ù§ Away from this cruel world!! üò¢</p>

        <p>It hurts real bad and I think it always will.  Her husband, my step-dad, looks at it like you do, and I suppose I do too in a way.  She could no longer care for herself at all.  I understood the restrictions for a while, but after around April or so I could see that they were overreaching.  Shit out of luck though we were, can't see Mom anymore.</p>
