    <strong>Politicians</strong>
    <p><p>Last night I was still pissed (still am) about that jack ass Texas politician who draft the HB 3 (not only does it not rein in the governor’s emergency powers it also expands other unelected powers. For example, for a business to have liability protection they must abide by whatever the CDC says. So if the CDC says 12 masks that is what the business must do.)</p>
<p>So I took a peek at Mr. Burrows FB page &amp; I saw that there were a few pissed people commenting. He gave the standard BS no-answers, said people were misinformed and never once addressed why business would be answering to the CDC.</p>
<p>This afternoon I took a peak &amp; low &amp; behold he had deleted all his comments (which in turned deleted everyone apart of the communication chain) so now the only one showing is one supporting him. I wish I had taken a screenshot last night. Because I would have pasted on the comments section &amp; ask why he deleted them. What is he hiding? If he’s so proud of his bill why delete comments? </p>
<p>Now I hate politicians on a good day. But when they lie &amp; then delete their lies it really pisses me off. He deserves the backlash he’s getting but he’s making sure it’s deleted so no one sees.</p>
<p>I wish I could do something but he’s not my rep &amp; I don’t know anyone in Lubbock.</p>
<p>I’m toying with seeing if I can get one of the media places I go will do an article on his shitty bill but I’m not sure it’ll do any good.</p>
<p>People have said here many times and it’s true. These jack-ass aren’t going to let us go back to normal...we must go back to normal on our own. 
I live a normal, muzzle-free like as best I can.</p></p>
