    <strong>Lisbon court rules only 0.9% of ‘verified cases’ died of COVID, numbering 152, not 17,000 claimed</strong>
    <p><p>Following a citizen’s petition, a Lisbon court was forced to provide verified COVID-19 mortality data, reports <a href="https://andre-dias.net/152-mortes-de-covid-em-portugal-desde-janeiro-2020/"><strong><em>AndreDias.net</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://andre-dias.net/wp-content/uploads/Fwd-Sentenca.pdf"><strong>ruling</strong></a>, the number of verified COVID-19 deaths from January 2020 to April 2021 is only 152, not about 17,000 as <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/portugal/"><strong>claimed</strong></a> by government ministries.</p>
<p>All the “others” died for various reasons, although their PCR test was positive.</p>
<p>“We live in a fraud of unprecedented dimensions,” wrote Dias.</p>

        <p>This is what blows my mind. People actually believed the numbers coming out of the States. And your point of "if you can read you should already know this" is bang on. The info is out there.</p>
<p>Africa has a population of 1.216 Billion. They only have 141K deaths from covid. The US, with a population of 328 Million and people are going to believe that it killed 604K people? like, really? You're telling me, in Africa, where their healthcare is far inferior to that of the western world the death rate for covid was 0.000116%, while the deathrate in the US was 0.0018%? It's unreal what people are letting themselves believe.</p>

        <p>I imagine a big discrepancy between the numbers in Africa versus the numbers in America would come from the reliability of the reporting. There is a good chance that due to the inferior healthcare in Africa, there were fewer cases that got correctly identified. I would also guess that determining the cause of death in Africa would be less reliable than in America</p>

        <p>Or.... the us completely over exaggerated their death rate to scare people until submission  to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>If you compare them to nearly any country their death rate is off the charts. I know anomalies can happen but by that magnitude? Seems way too fishy</p>

        <p>After just a little research, the death rates in USA don't seem drastically different than other countries. The US just has a massive population. I picked a few random countries to test this theory.</p>
<p>USA: Covid Deaths - 600k, Population - 328 million</p>
<p>600k / 328 million = 0.0018 &rt;&rt; 0.18%</p>
<p>France: Covid Deaths - 111k, Population - 67 million</p>
<p>111k / 67 million = 0.0016 &rt;&rt; 0.16%</p>
<p>Brazil: Covid Deaths - 513k, Population - 211 million</p>
<p>513k / 211 million = 0.0024 &rt;&rt; 0.24%</p>
<p>Sweden: Covid Deaths - 14k, Population - 10 million</p>
<p>14k / 10 million = 0.0014 &rt;&rt; 0.14%</p>
<p>USA isn't drastically different from any of these countries. I'd be curious to see what these numbers would be for every country but I don't have the time to figure that out.</p>

<p>After looking at some more countries, you are right I didn't pick enough countries to get a super good idea. After looking at more countries though I still don't think that America is a big enough outlier to conclude  that they are lying about the covid numbers.</p>

        <p>The CDC already came out and stated that their numbers are inflated. If you died within 28 days after a positive covid test than it was deemed covid. In my country, they admitted to including suicides as covid deaths. And this doesn't even touch on the fact that they have said there are 3 to 10 times more covid cases than what tested positive, further driving death rates down.</p>

        <p>They need to do that in the states so the stupid sheep will see that the 600,000 number they keep throwing around is bullshit as well. I'd say they need to do it in Canada but the numbers here aren't even higher than any other year and the sheep are still lopping up the lies.</p>

        <p>CDC 2 weeks ago put an asterix on that 600k number and stated that LESS than 5% of said deaths were due to only "covid"; hence, it could be 30k deaths, or 0 deaths as per CDC, but nowhere near the claimed 600k.</p>
<p>The fraud is getting exposed. </p>
