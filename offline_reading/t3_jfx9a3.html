        <p>The liberal government is elected by the "liberal" population. The problem is the media, schools, and universities pumping out far-left extremists.</p>

        <p>Honestly, at this point, I feel very disengaged. I'm at the point of just giving up on politics all together. I mean that literally - just talking about it with someone who disagrees with me is always a net negative to my life and mental well being.</p>
<p>Jeff is totally right. I read some Jonathan Haidt on the morals that influence our political orientation, and it's mostly subconscious. If you provide evidence that is contrary to their internal morality then they will not "switch sides" - at worst they will viscously fight back (if you critiqued them), at best they find a way to weasel out again and again.</p>
<p>Now this is just conjecture but it's something I spend a lot of time thinking about. I mean, I would spend hours not understanding why left-wingers were left-wing. I just couldn't understand how someone could be so illogical. So, I studied them endlessly. I studied their morality, their world-view, what makes them tick (as well as right-wingers, but this was easier for me to understand). There are surprisingly common threads, which is why usually left-wingers and right-wingers tend to cluster around certain beliefs sets. What I wanted to understand was <em>why</em>. What the underlying, subconscious belief set was, that led to the concrete beliefs that people were explicate exponents of.</p>
<p>My current best guess is, at it's root, it comes down to evolution. The "official" wikipedia definition of a right-winger is someone who "represents the view that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal, or desirable". In other words, right-wingers are more comfortable with hierarchies and inequality, and left-wingers want to equalize everyone. <em>Cui bono?</em> There are a number of clues that are scattered around. For example, the more physically stronger a man is, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10061462/Stronger-men-are-more-right-wing.html">the more likely he is to be right-wing</a>. I looked into physiognomy (a very controversial branch in our current left-wing zeitgeist, but containing many scientific truths brushed under the rug) and found that it is <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008733">surprisingly easy to guess if someone is Republican or Democrat</a> based on nothing more than a picture of their face in a neutral expression. It was particularly easy to spot Republican women - this had the highest success rate. What they also discovered was that Republican women were on average judged as significantly more physically attractive, or beautiful, than their Democratic counterparts.</p>
<p>&rt;  In Study 1, perceivers were able to accurately distinguish whether U.S. Senate candidates were either Democrats or Republicans based on photos of their faces. Study 2 showed that these effects extended to Democrat and Republican college students, based on their senior yearbook photos. Study 3 then showed that these judgments were related to differences in perceived traits among the Democrat and Republican faces. <strong>Republicans were perceived as more powerful than Democrats.</strong></p>
<p>Here is the crux of it, in my opinion. Right-wingers have the most to gain from a "free" system, such as capitalism, or any system which represents a free market where everyone can "fight for themselves" and shine brighter than others. Left-wingers have the most to gain from a socialist system or any system or ideology where things are "equalized" (such as fat acceptance for ugly women, or other feminist ideologies for example). My rabbit hole went deeper, and led me to the theory of <a href="https://spandrell.com/2017/11/14/biological-leninism/">Biological Leninism</a> which is really a fantastic read if anything I have written here has interested you. It essentially outlines how there has been a coalition of traditionally "low status" groups (women, ethnic minorities, disabled people, transgender, homosexuals, less intelligent people, ugly people, insert x traditionally low-status group here) who have come together and lobbied for their interests at the expense of people who would naturally rise to the top in a meritocracy. It also explains the apparent hypocrisy of a group such as feminists, being allied with a group such as Muslims, who on paper appear to have completely contradictory goals ideologically. Biological Leninism offers the explanation.</p>
<p>In conclusion it's a complete waste of time because these people have <em>so much</em> to lose if the status quo goes back to how it was before. They are fighting tooth and nail because they currently wield incredible power through universities, news, media, etc, to push their narrative, and Trump was a (mild) backlash against this endless "progress" in their direction - and they have gone completely apoplectic during the past 4 years. No amount of debate will convince these people to abandon what is in their best interests, and ultimately their genetic survival on an existential level. You are fighting the most powerful evolutionary urge in the world, and it's not even conscious. It's a complete waste of time. Currently I must just accept that we are living in a world that due to our insane standard of living (historically) it has allowed these grotesque ideologies to grow and flourish - as soon as the going gets tough again things will return to "normal" but unfortunately for that to happen there needs to be some sort of collapse.</p>
