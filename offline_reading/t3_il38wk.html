        <p>Diabetic asthmatic, had it in February <em>probably.</em> I was diagnosed with "probable" influenza at the time, but the test ended up coming back negative. Since I work at a hospital (frontline manager) I was able to get an antibody test in April, and that came back positive. I don't completely trust the results, especially that early on, which is why I say I <em>probably</em> had it. It is what it is however.</p>
<p>The worst symptom I had was conjunctivitis (pinkeye), and that was more annoying than anything. If it was bacterial there are drops out there that'll kill it in 24 hours, mine lasted a week. I had a cough for about 3 days, with only 1 night being anything overly noticeable as I broke the fever the next morning. Had a sore throat for about a week afterwords that I just couldn't shake, so I was hammering lozenges like there was no tomorrow. Other than that, it wasn't all that bad... if that's indeed what I had, and I've been exposed <em>plenty</em> at work since then.</p>
<p>I had H1N1 back in 2009 and that hammered me good. Put me out of commission for almost 10 days and I was miserable. This, as I told my staff when I got back, was the "weirdest flu I ever had." I never really felt all that bad.</p>

        <p>Not sure about comorbidities but everyone here I would think, has covid officially, because those without symptoms are called "asymptomatic disease spreaders" in the new normal.</p>

        <p>No, but I will say that I have lost 10 lbs (I am already small) and so my dr took my blood and my thyroid, liver, and gallbladder levels are off...likely bec of my recent new hobbies of drinking and enjoying covid - issued stress and depression</p>
