    <p><p>Ignorance is fucking bliss and there are a lot of smooth-brained morons happily lapping up this rancid piss-puddle of liquid dog-dookie, firm in their beliefs that we are all collectively fighting for "the greater good" (fucking cult-speak by the way) by locking down everyone, steering society towards a cashless, purely digital system that obviously wouldn't even be fucking possible a couple years ago, and vaccinating the world against a cold virus with a 99.9% survival rate. Lunatics.</p>
<p>Whether this was all planned in advance or not (I would lean towards it was), the "elites" of the World have certainly capitalized on the fear and compliant cuckoldery displayed by a depressing majority of the population and used it to bring about their fucking twisted Utopian fantasy and build back better towards a "new normal". The insane amount of propaganda, use of bots and crisis actors, mass censorship and countries around the World performing in near lock-step suggests there is something more nefarious and sinister going on behind the scenes.</p>
<p>It would be easier to ignore all this. To not argue with it. To just go along with the charade. But I can't, and won't. I think a lot more people are aware that there's something quite off about everything but refuse to let their true feelings be known for fear of the mob and being seen as a dissident/conspiracy theorist/Republican (THE HORROR!). Hell, most of the people I know who are all-in on Covid still break and bend the fucking rules when it suits them. They're just more quiet about it and treat it as a cheeky one-off or treat. Anything to justify the nonsense around them that they're complicit in.</p></p>

        <p>This was so good, thank you for putting it into words. I am in New York and I just attended a meeting of people that are trying to figure out how to reclaim our power.. I never thought at this point in my life I would become some sort of activist but it's been forced on me as a matter of necessity. I don't have children of my own but I worry about the future for younger people. I feel that it is my duty as a human to do everything I possibly can to fight this and if I die while doing it then so be it. I pray that I live long enough to see the people that are perpetuating this suffer but I'm at the point where I doubt that will ever happen. I ask myself every morning when I wake up and feel sick, why am I still here? Why was I put here during this time? The only thing I can come up with is that I am here to witness this Awakening and I have to do everything I possibly can to be one of the voices fighting. There are so many that can't see it, when you are one of the ones that can see it it is your moral duty to stand up.</p>
