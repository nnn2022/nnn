        <p>Yep. There are very obviously class, and by extension racial dynamics at play when it comes to lockdowns. But nobody even thinks of it because it’s people in the global south who are suffering the worst. The only use first world doomers have for them is the “Stay the Fuck Home” shirt that they stitched together for $0.12 an hour</p>

<p>We don't give a shit about awful deadly diseases that ravage third-world countries every year.  We only care about trendy diseases that somehow managed to find their way into the Western world and killed a couple famous people.  Then cry that it's a "race issue" when black and hispanic people in America start getting sick, despite the fact that we don't give a flying fuck about black people in Africa dying from illnesses every day.</p>

        <p>Why are you lying?</p>
<p>As of April 1, there were 1000 cases of COVID in the USA - not deaths - just cases.  When should the yearly count start?   I'd say May 1 at the absolute earliest.   Even July 1 is too early to be compared fairly with TB.  TB was already spread as much as it was going to spread - it was endemic (is that the word?) - before Jan 1.  SARS-CoV-2 was still spreading as of July 1 (it's still spreading now).   If you want to compare TB and COVID I would start July 1, but you can use May 1 or April 1 if you want.   We're only 5 months in to this being a wide-spread disease.</p>
<p>1 million have died from COVID.   How many have died since May 1?  800,000 in 5 months.  At that rate, it would be 1.92 million from within a year - and that's with all the safety rules.   Medical practice has improved, and more of the population has developed immunity, so it's possible only 1.5 million will die within the year.  If people believe it's a conspiracy or decide they just don't care and so they ignore health rules and guides, then it may spread more rapidly so 3 million deaths is not out of the question.**</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I think tuberculosis has had roughly the same # of deaths every year for many years.  Correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I don't think tuberculosis spreads like a pandemic.  It is communicable, but have the #s risen like SARS-CoV-2?  Noooooo.</p>
<p>If you wrote that as many people will die from TB as from COVID in a year, I wouldn't say you are lying, I'd say you're making predictions too easily, but you might be right.</p>
<p>Your claim that twice as many die from TB is either based on misunderstandings, intentional distortion, or just a willingness to make unfair inadequate comparisons.  This isn't perfect, but it's like you're comparing a 10-year-old dog's distance-walked-since-January-1 vs a puppy conceived in December and born in March.   As of July 1 or even Oct 1 the older dog may have walked farther.  Give it a true full year and you'll see otherwise.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>All this said, I do share the question:  Why has tuberculosis not been declared a global pandemic?</p>
<p>What irks me is people who ask this as a rhetorical question - assuming and implying the answer is conspiracy and/or injustice - instead of sincerely seeking understanding.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>* (Some people believe only 6% actually died from COVID, but that's because they're gullible.  If you get COVID and then die of respiratory failure, your death certificate shows you died of respiratory failure and you had COVID</p>
<p>** 3 million deaths in the context of the global population is not big, so I'm not saying COVID is the worst thing ever - but that's in part thanks to the safety regulations.  It would be much much higher if we'd let it run wild.</p>

        <p>Getting close to 1 Million dead world-wide now too, in less than a year of full out spreading.  2nd leading cause of death in the United states.  Only Heart disease kills more this year and this has only been going on since March.  If you break it down differently it's the 3rd leading cause where only heart disease and all kinds of cancer combined have killed more.</p>

        <p>This is just whataboutery. In the US, Covid19 is simply what's more important to us right now.  It's killing far more US citizens than TB.  We can't solve poverty in our own nation, how are we going to solve it for other countries?  We give time money and effort to stopping it, it's not being ignored.  HIV/AIDS is also something we have more or less solved in the US and try to help with in other countries too.  It's great that you are bringing it up though (even if it's in a facetious way), always good to raise awareness.</p>

        <p>If the world stopped because of a disease that’s killed 1 million people, why doesn’t it stop for a disease that kills 1.5 million annually? I’m a lifelong Marxist btw so I’m definitely not doing it in bad faith</p>

        <p>Because it's brand new and we didn't want it to kill 10 million this year and 1.5 every year going forward.  Also, when a disease like this hits it has potential to overwhelm the healthcare system and kill the front line workers making it all that much worse.</p>

        <p>While you speculate about a potential 10 million deaths based on projections that have been wrong every step of the way, in reality 250 million people have been thrown into LIFE-THREATENING food insecurity.</p>

        <p>Where were you with all the food insecurity previous to Covid?  Just admit you only care about first world LIFE-THREATENING food insecurity and move on👍 </p>
<p>The mental gymnastics you guys go through is EXHAUSTING.  You don't care about actual information, you only care about the election and only deal in the negative.  Any information given to you, you just ignore the answer and bring up some other negative falsehood.</p>
<p>BTW - Marx would be absolutely pissed that this disease was rampant right now.  He'd be all over the left wing news about how he told everyone that capitalism and meat markets caused this disease.  How if that market in China weren't open, we wouldn't be ruled by nature as if it's uncontrollable.  Your arguments seem to mirror Fox News more than anything.</p>

        <p>I was organizing with the anti-imperialism caucus in my local DSA chapter?? Obviously I hold the Marxist position on the dialectical relationship of humans to nature, but at this point that’s fucking useless absent abolishing global capitalism which we’re in no position to do. Even VLADIMIR MOTHERFUCKING LENIN was pragmatic in this way. When the Bolsheviks seized the state he didn’t try to instantly implement communism proper, and instead went with the NEP, which had markets, money and classes to develop productive forces while waiting for global revolution</p>
