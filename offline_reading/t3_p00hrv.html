    <strong>Of Donald Trump won the election in the US do you think the vaccine narrative would have been flipped?</strong>
    <p><p>I seriously thought about this a few times and I'm sure this has been posted here. But I want to hear your opinions. Do you think that the mainstream  media would have been asking questions much like how we do here in NoNewNormal? Do you think more people who are rabidly pro-vaccine would have been skeptical? I ask this because I'm thinking of what Kamala Harris said, and in general looking at how crazy people have gotten on coercing pple into vaccines or the dystopian vaccine passports are being introduced. </p>
<p>How do you guys think this would this have all played out if it was the Trump administration in charge?</p>
<p>I await insightful thoughts =)</p></p>

        <p>I'm pretty nuteral on Trump. Not really a major fan of him liked most policies tho (which is more important imo). But yeah I used to get pple jaw dropping simply cuz I didnt hate him. I think there deff would be many more people in the streets for yes the same shit.</p>

        <p>If you see all the flip flopping posts where last year someone said they would never take a rushed Trump vaccine and this year the same person is posting how excited they are for their jab I think there’s your answer.</p>
<p>there’s also a video of Pelosi last fall saying no one could ever make you take a vaccine or ask your status. Why isn’t she standing up for our health rights now?</p>

        <p>Before the election I had already decided not to get this vaccine.  There is nothing political about my decision.  I voted for Trump both times. It was rushed and is still experimental.  It kind of reminds me of the Anthrax vaccine I was lucky enough to avoid.  It was safe and effective too... though now some of the guys I served with are on disability from having it.</p>

        <p>Well when he was president all the doomer dems openly stated they would not trust or take a vaccine developed under his administration. Liberals are morally bankrupt and hypocrites so Yes, I believe they would be against vaccines. THEY would be shouting MY BODY MY CHOICE and burning down cities</p>

        <p>Trump was 100% in on this and he likely would be doing most of the same things… He probably wouldn’t have audacity to attempt the federal lockdown Xiden will try in next week or two, but everything else likely very similar.</p>

        <p>Yeah this is true. But in terms of maybe the cultural narrative. I think its possible youd see a lot more leftists becoming so called "anti-vax" cuz they would tie the vaccine to Trump. Then again they could credit and say big pharma. Who knows tho, mainly why I'm asking the question to see if anyone else thought about this.</p>

        <p>I have a theory that this is all by design weaponizing the two party system against the public, i think the expectation was they would get mass compliance if the movement started with a republican and ended with a Democrat, that way the really campy types would get it right away and everyone else would be coerced. I don’t think that worked well for them bc I think the opposition isn’t really composed of two party minds, i think the bulk of people against this wouldn’t have participated if it were trump. I wasn’t for it while Trump was in and I’m not for it while Biden is. My mind isn’t swayed based off political affiliation. That’s just me and I think lots of members of this sub think the same. Could be just projecting though. Not sure.</p>

        <p>Trump and his administration were among them the first to be vaccinated. The only thing that would be different is that the President would’ve been lying about his position on the topic.</p>

        <p>Yes lefties would be more skeptical, especially when Biden, Harris and Cuomo were all skeptical of the vaccine roll-out only because Trump was the one behind it. Crazy that people have already forgotten that part, why didn't they want the vaccine? It's still the same science and scientists behind it right?</p>

        <p>I think Trump was given Fauci and trusted in the science.  But he was doubting him in the end and wanting drugs to help people with covid and was given major shit about it.  He was all for post covid drugs but starting research for a vax. His post covid plan for helping folks was made a mockery by the press and still is.</p>

        <p>I think more people would still be hesitant, there was many people saying they would not take a shot made while Trump was president, but then Biden comes in and it’s all ok, but they had nothing to do with it and was being developed before the election, so really the dose it self makes no difference who won, but I think lots would have denied it solely because he was president.</p>

        <p>Lefty randos and political wannabes would refuse to take the "Trump Vaccine", skeptics like most of the people here would still be skeptical, the very very few actual "cultist" Trump supporters would probably be vaxxed and probably are vaxxed in this timeline as well, nobody would be pushing for mandates to get the vax, you'd probably see more state level lockdowns and less federal efforts to lock down. Not sure what foreigners would do, maybe there would be a bigger push for the foreign made vaccines since they wouldn't be tainted by Trump, never can predict what dumb shit Europe will get up to so not a lot of point speculating what effect our elections would have on them</p>
