        <p>Ideally, a moderator would ban those who break a subreddit's rules. Instead, we've been seeing patterns of moderators banning participants for unrelated reasons that have nothing at all to do with a subreddit's rules. </p>
<p>This behavior is getting out of control. It is a blatant example of a misinformation campaign that is personally being used by some members, who are also moderators, of Reddit in order to discourage the exposure and discussion of information about a topic from a different viewpoint, which defeats the purpose of encouraging a proper debate in order to properly weigh, analyze, and discuss a topic's strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>I wish that there was a site-wide rule against the banning of a user, unless there's documented, irrefutable proof of their subreddit rule infringements.  There should also be a site-wide rule that prohibits a subreddit rule from being used to control and restrict how Redditors participate in other subreddit communities. No one should be penalized in a manipulative manner for their desire to exhibit and participate in the engagement of free speech.</p>

        <p>Everybody that has gotten, or does get, any ban from unrelated subs like that, please report each of them as harassment to the Reddit admins.</p>
<p>After reporting a couple, I think that most ways of reporting them <em>probably</em> simply go back to the offending sub mods.</p>
<p>The way to be sure that a harassment report goes to reddit admins seems to be ONLY by doing it exactly this way (I'm sorry if I'm mistaken here, but this is the best I've got so far):</p>
<p>Use a web browser and go to:   https://new.reddit.com/message/messages/</p>
<p>It's critical to use 'new.' rather than just 'www.' or 'old.' so that the "permalink" feature on the message(s) is available, so that that link can be pasted into the report form.</p>
<p>Find the offensive message and capture the "permalink" - there should be about half a dozen features under each message, "permalink" being one of them.  In android, it's captured with long click and select "copy link", in windows it's like r-click and select "copy link", so do whatever you need to do in your web browser to copy the "permalink" into the clipboard.</p>
<p>With that link in the clipboard, open a new tab and go to:  https://reddit.com/report  I think you can follow this link and get to the right place.</p>
<p>Select the choices "I want to report spam or abuse", "this is abusive or harassing", "it's targeted harassment", "At me", and then paste the link in the spot for link.  I don't see any need for "additional information", but you do you.  Just keep in mind you'd be taking up a person's time to read that and we're the good guys here.</p>
<p>This is long to describe, but it's pretty quick and easy to do.</p>
<p>You'll get a "Help Center Report" message confirmation.  That's how you know for sure it went to reddit administration, and definitely not back to the perpetrating sub.</p>
<p>But please don't make another post here about it.  There's been a whole fucking lot of them already.  We know.</p>
