    <strong>[Rant/Discussion] Has anyone else worked like normal this whole time?</strong>
    <p><p>The weirdest part about the past year and a half is that my job was deemed "essential" and I never got a day off. Not only that, but almost nothing about my work actually changed. No masks, no social distancing, no working from home. About 50 workers in an office/warehouse setting. Business as usual. And I don't live in a rural city in a red state. I live in a masked-up locked-down blue city in CA, doomer center really. I'm a statistical anomaly.</p>
<p>Why do I bring this up? Because I think the fact that my work life continued on like normal is what fueled my initial skepticism of the virus and lockdowns, and what ultimately led me to realize I'm not afraid of the virus. All my friends went WFH, and coincidentally they were all terrified of the virus and didn't want to leave their apartments.</p>
<p>Everyone is talking about how "dangerous" it is to go back to the office. About how dangerous it is to go back to school. Everyone needs to be vaccinated! Everyone needs to wear masks! Everyone needs to wear masks even after being vaccinated just in case! And even then, let's do split schedules, WFH as much as possible, etc...</p>
<p>I'm over here like... "uhh, guys? It's fine. We're all fine. Stop acting so crazy. Just work like usual. I've been doing it for a year straight. We're not all dying."</p>
<p>The annoying part is, even though my work-life was not affected by the pandemic, literally all other aspects of my life were. I would leave a day of work, 8 hours of normality, and enter the sea of masked-up scared individuals. Everything shuttered, or running on half-capacity and reduced services for over a year.</p>
<p>And the cherry on top is that now everyone is touting the vaccine as the only way for us to go back to normal. Let me be clear: We've been normal this ENTIRE time. No vaccine was necessary. No masks were necessary. Just sane management who valued freedom and hard work.</p>
<p>Anyway, this whole past year has made me feel like I'm living in some terrible episode of the Twilight Zone where my work stayed normal, and everyone else went insane. But are there others just like me? Would be curious to here other people's stories.</p></p>

        <p>I’m in the same boat. I do construction and we were deemed essential and according to the construction association guidelines we were exempt from the gathering guidelines and when everybody was supposed to limit 5 ppl to a place we didn’t have to adhere to that. So we had multiple trades in a house at the same time, way more than 5 people, no masks, no social distancing even if we wanted to.</p>
<p>I don’t think all that stuff is necessary to begin with so I didn’t mind, but like you I quickly came the realization that a mass psychosis was happening when everything is fine</p>

        <p>During the early months of the pandemic, when I commuted to work on completely empty roads, I noticed 2 groups that seemed to be out and working as normal: construction workers, and cops. I felt a little kinship with those professions, feeling like we were the only sane ones continuing to work in an insane world. Grocery store workers too, even though they went pretty hardcore on the masks early on.</p>

        <p>Yeah at this point I am immediately attracted to anyone not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>There is 1 store where I live where the guy has not been enforcing it and at this point if he sells something I am getting it there before I go anywhere else. He still has the plexiglass shield up and wears a mask now after a customer complained but it’s a small business and I’d rather overpay for something there than give Walmart anymore money lol</p>

        <p>Same exact thing for me.  Saw my friends, family etc too.  I refused to wear a mask. Been fine as has all those I’ve been in contact with.  The whole thing is a sham.  I also have been saying we are in the Twilight Zone.  Stay free my friend!</p>

        <p>Where I work there’s a mask mandate, but it’s pretty lax and we don’t enforce it. Occasionally we’ll get a weirdo that’ll get dramatic and cause a stir - then we go strict for a week and back to lax.</p>
<p>They won’t admit it, but we’re all sick of it already.</p>

        <p>I work in a half warehouse/half office setting. A mask rule was implemented and is technically still in place but it was de facto optional. Only once was I asked to wear one and it was just that, asked. I declined. All other aspects of work were normal, barring a week off due to the Icepocalypse in February. We were all fine, and still are.</p>
<p>Meanwhile my wife and my friends have mostly worked from home or were canned. Warehouse work isn't the most glamorous, but it produces a lot of resilient workers.</p>

<p>Things got pretty serious with mask stuff for a few months, but about the only thing left is the policy now. </p>

        <p>Same here and that's exactly the feeling. My job never closed. We worked indoors and never implemented masks. Everyone I worked with did come down with Covid, but it was like a mild flu. I never caught it and they were around me without a mask at one point</p>
<p>And my dad is a doctor who has helped at Covid crisis centers and he's told me most people are dying from lack of knowledge / medical care. He usually works in nursing homes and had great success with a steroid that was banned by the WHO for the treatment of Covid. He's told me that medication has saved countless lives and I saw it myself when my grandpa came down with Covid. He's in his 80s and he has heart issues and asthma. He did have trouble breathing at first so he went to the hospital but they sent him home after giving him Remdesivir and antibiotics. He didn't get any better so my dad gave him the steroid and it was incredible. Within about 5 hours, he did a complete turn around and just improved more and more from there.</p>
<p>I've lost all trust in the CDC and the WHO</p>
<p>And I definitely share your experience. My life never changed and what I saw was a very big contrast from what the news said so I never felt that fear. But on the other hand, I have a friend who was pretty locked up with the news and she was terrified... Double masking and everything. It's saddening more than anything. People are truly being manipulated and they're just scared and in their mind, only a crazy person wouldn't follow along</p>

        <p>More or less. Lost my job when COVID started picking up steam around March last year. One job went well into the summer (was only supposed to take a couple weeks but they hired morons so it took longer) and never once wore a mask. It was for a large (liberal) financial institution as well, lots of gay propos everywhere. Went back later in the year to help on another job there, and they were such dicks about it they stopped me at the front desk and said I wasn’t wearing a mask when I clearly was. </p>
<p>Other than that, it’s been a formality. Show up wearing a mask when no one else is, then ask to take it off so you can actually breathe and work. Largely no one ever cared. Now that tyranny is lifted in my state, literally no one cares. Once in a while especially downtown you’ll see the NPCs wearing masks outside or in their car but it’s mostly normal here.</p>

        <p>Shortly after the "fatal and terrifying" disease started making the news, late February/early March, before the "lockdown", one of my coworkers asked me, if I thought we would shutdown. I replied "Not unless or until the government makes us." Turns out I was right.</p>
<p>We were deemed essential, so we kept working. Except for less traffic, and the mask mandates out in public, (oh, and the 24/7 ad campaign) I  wouldn't have had any idea we were having a pandemic.</p>
<p>According to Google, at this point in time, we (my state) have 846 deaths attributed to the disease. </p>
<p>Very. Scary. Pandemic. Indeed. /s</p>

        <p>The worst I had, being in a fast food restaurant for the time being, was masks, drive-they only, and reduced hours(even though remarkably the sales numbers went farther up than previously projected). It allowed me to finish up more projects at home and finish a couple of my TV shows but other than that very little changed it seemed like. The only thing I had a very noticeable change in was when I had to do my shopping with all of the reduced store hours, masks, social distancing, etc.</p>

        <p>Lol yeah no mask too it’s beautiful. I don’t have to hear if I’m getting the vaccine either because no one gives a fuck and they don’t give a fuck about masks either.</p>

        <p>My job acted like normal but they gave the option of working from home if desired. I have always wanted to work from home. Most of my team members are across the country anyways so there was no need for me to be in the office. </p>
<p>Tbh, I think working from home is the only good thing to come from this whole thing. I love it. I know others don’t but I do.</p>

        <p>Never missed a day of work. In fact worked longer hours because of the riots last summer. Never wore a mask. Also can't believe people who are "scared to go back".</p>

        <p>Same here for the most part, had a few cases at work but that's mostly due to being tested (accurate am I right) as opposed to proper symptomatic cases (which have happened but no deaths)</p>

        <p>My current job I got lucky with because I can go the whole day mask-less as I don't need to talk to many customers.</p>
<p>Night shift is the way to go if your desperate to escape mask use, they also pay okay.</p>

        <p>I’m an “essential worker”. Worked through the pandemic. I was at work when they officially announced the pandemic last March. My boss had the news on, and I knew it was bullshit when all the major players (Walgreens, Walmart, CVS, etc.) got up and said they were going to do everything in their power to help public health. Their stocks skyrocketed that day.</p>
