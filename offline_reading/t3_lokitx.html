    <strong>Coming from a minimally restrictive state, why don’t those from Lockdown States just ignore it??</strong>
    <p><p>Grab a few canned beans, put them in a grocery plastic sack, throw it in your backseat, if you get pulled over or questioned, you were going grocery shopping- you just got back from Walmart, or Kroger. Seems simple enuf, no? Throw some legal documents in an envelope, obviously conducting legal business is not forbidden even in a lockdown state, real estate transactions, etc.... Heck, just drive around with the vehicle title in your car, you were going to sell your car to someone, but you couldn’t agree on the price. Even if you are ticketed, the judge will throw it out on the spot.</p>
<p>Edit: <em>Never make any statements to the police, EVER!</em></p></p>

        <p>A lot of people are ignoring it and the police don’t really enforce it most places in CA. However, a lot of people’s friends and family are fully on board with the BS, so they can’t socialize with them.  Also, if you like going to restaurants, bars or movie theaters, you are out of luck.</p>

        <p>Yeah I get you can’t do much about the restaurants or schools or other social venues. I just don’t know much about those holing up in their homes and not going out. I can’t see that ever happening in Arkansas. And they were always moving the goalposts. They said Arkansas was going to be hit hard becoz we never closed restaurants or implemented mask mandates or really did anything. Then when we <em>weren’t</em> “hit hard” they said it was becoz we’re “so rural, no large cities” (our largest city is 190,000 next largest city is like 60,000).</p>

<p>There are three good cooks in my household, we only drink occasionally and the combination of a 65" OLED, Dolby Atmos Sound System, and a renewed love of movie piracy...I've got my bases covered regarding restaurants, bars and theaters.</p>
<p>The private school we are looking at sending our daughter too has been closed a total of two weeks and they decided to open up as well.</p>

        <p>I think it's a problem of about 40% of people who are willing to ignore it if they see 5% ignore, and so on. But in those places it hasn't kicked off yet.</p>

        <p>I live in CA and where I'm at, they mostly don't give a fuck.  probably more than half the locals don't wear masks outside, there's an indoor gym I go to and there's even a bar I can go get shit-faced at if I want.  There's also a few restaurants I frequent.  And get this: none of these places require masks.  Trust me, if you get off the computer and go outside, you'll find a way to live normally.</p>

        <p>Yeah theres probably alot of reasons for that.  Some, if not most, have been brainwashed since kindergarten to unquestionably accept appeals to authority.  Fauci says be scared so they listen.  Another part of it is dramatizing.  Believe it or not, there is a primitive desire that is deeply rooted in us that thrives when it is placed in strenuous or harsh circumstances.  The fight against man or nature often gives people a sense of purpose.  We live in a world that is the antithesis of purpose and deep down everybody kind of realizes that.  So the pandemic provided an answer to that void.  People began identifying covid as their new crusade.  This is why so many doomers get heated when we talk about going back to normal.  Because going back to normal means, for many of them, a life without excitement and purpose.</p>

        <p>It sucks because there are so many noble causes to fight for but people get caught up in the extraneous.  We have an urge to fight for something, and in some cases, anything.  Unfortunately, we let the media tell us to fight each other.  It probably hasn't been since the 60's that young adults protested war.  Or even said fuck corporate America.  Now it's "down with capitalism" with an iPhone in the back pocket.  We're too locked into the media-social media juggernaut for independent thoughts and movements to flourish.</p>

        <p>Not really in a "lockdown" state per-se, but we did have an extended curfew for quite awhile.  I definitely ignored that and hung out with people during those hours the most.  Even spent a small amount of time in bars during them that were willing to look the other way a bit past curfew.</p>
<p>The problem with those restrictions is they target already targeted businesses, and it's not you that has to be willing to ignore it.  It's them and most are even more risk adverse right now.</p>
