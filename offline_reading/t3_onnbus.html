    <strong>Family member and his wife recently tested positive for covid. Ivermectin seems to have helped.</strong>
    <p><p>Day one and two of symptoms they felt really bad.  He said no taste, fever and super tired. I told them about a friend who had good results with ivermectin so he went to the doc and got was able to get a prescription. </p>
<p>Walgreens wouldn’t fill it. Don’t know why.</p>
<p>Some other pharmacy did. One day later taste is back and feeling a lot better. </p>
<p>Anecdotal I know but I’ve heard several reports just like this. </p>
<p>Imagine how many lives could have been saved if we had listened to the right scientists and doctors in the first place.</p></p>

        <p>Hearing stories like this is great but also infuriating. Last year I was very sick with covid and almost died and nobody even suggested this medicine. I laid in my bed thinking everyday was my last day and a simple inexpensive medicine could have helped my recovery weeks and weeks earlier. I hope others can learn about this medicine either before they get sick or early in their sickness so they don't have to go through what I did. I will just add that I had the OG virus early on and it was pretty strong, I think people now are lucky this Delta variant is 19 times less deadly.</p>

        <p>Because it's way less expensive than the vaccine injection so they can't make money off of it.  Luckily big pharma has politicians in their pockets to prevent the companies from losing money</p>

        <p>They could still develop blood clots and/or cytokine storm. They should talk to a dr about maybe taking baby aspirin or blood thinners. Also a steroid to prevent cytokine storm.

        <p>two family members of mine living in the same house got covid, one went to the hospital and ended up in the ICU. the other was prescribed ivermectin and had a similar situation as above: some symptoms but quick turnaround - no hospitalization.</p>
<p>I heard about ivermectin from bret weinstein, asked the family member what their doctor gave them after listening to it: ivermectin. When they listened to the podcast I sent, they were absolutely floored that this silencing on ivermectin was going on, also didn't realize what a limb their doctor had gone out on at the time to prescribe it.</p>
