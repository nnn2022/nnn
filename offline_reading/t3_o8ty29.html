    <strong>AITA For Breaking My Own Rules By Shagging Someone Behind My Wife's Back?</strong>
    <p><p>Alright I know this sounds bad but just hear me out before you go making snap judgements. Basically what happened was I (M42) was under a lot of stress at work (won't say what my job was but it was pretty high level and I was under a lot of scrutiny) and my home life wasn't too great either as my wife's been very cold towards me lately for, in her words, "fucking the country into the dirt". Also my "best friend", who we'll call B (M57), has been nice to my face but I found out from another friend D (M49) that he's been slagging me off behind my back and they've been laughing at me over WhatsApp. I felt very betrayed and upset at this, as you could understand.</p>
<p>Well, that led to an affair with my aide and it all got caught on camera. Thing is it's not the affair that's the main issue here but the fact that I've been telling people for months not to hug one another and to maintain social distancing (under the threat of a fine). Well, the shit hit the fan as you can imagine and now my wife hates me, the public hates me and even B, who's defended me in public but that's only cause he shags around too, privately told me to either "jump before I'm pushed" out of my job. I think it's safe to say my marriage and career is over but that's okay because I've gotten away with millions of pounds and I've made a right mug out of everyone for months on end and they'll still follow the rules even though I've demonstrated they're bullshit because they're fucking saps. </p>
<p>AITA?</p></p>
