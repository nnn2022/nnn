        <p>By the CDC number saying that about 6% died OF the virus itself,about 30,000 died...like an average flu season. A flu we for some reason just didn’t SEE...why didn’t we see it? Because the part of the flu was being played by Covid.</p>
<p>Answer it in another way that makes sense without reaching and huge leaps of faith...same symptoms. Same method of spread. When I got Covid they gave me the exact same azithromyacin I got for the flu the year before and I got over it in the exact same 3 days. AND the exact same ineffectiveness of masks to prevent the spread of it...It’s no wonder that people think it’s fake (my good friend is a medical doctor so I know it’s a real virus,it just wasn’t worthy of the response) ...ockhams razor...</p>

        <p>You do realize there's no actual hard figures on influenza deaths per year, right?  The CDC uses mathematical modeling to determine the ifr because only going by death certificates would grossly underestimate the number of flu deaths.  This is also why they they combine flu and pneumonia into one ICD code.</p>
<p>According the the CDC themselves, \~43% of Covid deaths also had influenza and pneumonia.  43% of 500k is 215k.  So, 215k died of influenza and pneumonia, and that's WITH MASKS.  Also, Sars-CoV2 is airborne like measles and TB.  Non-95 masks offer as much protection as a mesh condom against these types of bugs.</p>
<p>So, paint your picture of how bad Covid is.  The truth is you aren't using evidence to paint it, only the kind of sense born of ignorance.</p>

Pneumonia is caused by COVID-19 and/or the flu and the common cold</p>
<p>Non-n95 masks are still effective because they catch spittle from coughing, which is how covid ACTUALLY spreads</p>
<p>My picture of how dangerous COVID is is painted with the blood of those who died from it and the tears of their loved ones. By believing in the lies spewed within the echo-chamber that is this sub you and everyone who believes it are putting the lives of others in jeopardy because you don’t like having a bit of cloth over your face for a few minutes</p>

        <p>Educate yourself.  Pneumonia has a wide variety of causes.  The most common is bacterial pneumonia.  That's bacteria, not Covid.  Covid pneumonia has it's own ICD code, but the CDC isn't using that.  They're using the code that includes bacteria.  Wonder why that is?  Maybe because it's bacterial pneumonia?  Hmmm...</p>
<p>The WHO and CDC have both said Covid is airborne.  It does mainly spread in droplets, but also in particles too small to be stopped by non-N95 masks.  Those airborne particles hang in the air and are spread much farther than the 6 feet you see for droplet-borne pathogens.  </p>
<p>This is most important when people are in enclosed spaces.  Inside buildings, social distancing and most masks don't significantly reduce spread.  Ventilation and limiting time indoors are the deciding factors.</p>
<p>Please keep spouting the propaganda that masks prevent you from spreading it, and protects others.  If you don't wear a mask, then you don't care about people.  Using guilt and shame to get people to do what you want instead of providing accurate info and letting them decide for themselves.  You actually think that is moral?! /smh
You know why healthcare workers wear masks in patient rooms?  Spoiler!  It's not to protect the patients.</p>
<p>It's not about the cloth.  It's about being forced to do something that provides zero benefit.  It's about giving up your freedom for NOTHING!</p>

        <p>Those masks haven’t done anything...none of these restrictions have. If they DID work,how did the numbers continually increase even WITH shutdowns and stay at home orders? The ONLY masks that were effective in the least were N95 respirators...but 99% of people are wearing bandannas and gaiters...the LEAST effective masks. The flu DIDNT go away! It’s identical symptoms spread in the identical way with nearly identical effects!!! I don’t think I really need to paint a picture here for you to see what is happening here...masks have ZERO effect on the spread of viral infection! There are numerous studies that categorically prove that as a fact! Nobody...no doctors no surgeons...NOBODY before March of 2020 would have recommended a mask to prevent viral spread. I have bookmarks to tons of actual scientific studies on mask effectiveness against viruses if you want to see them...there’s no shortage. I know a lot of people bought into this mask crap but it is bollocks and going past page two of a google search on “mask effectiveness against viral infection” will tell you the truth. If you see a study saying they work it is AFTER February of 2020...nothing before that made those claims.</p>
<p>I also could not find a time in history where healthy people were quarantined...</p>

        <p>Many of those people, like you, really haven't lost their liberties. You're still not wearing a mask and not socially distancing. I mean, you're complaining about these super-strict laws and rules that everyone follows blindly, but a <em>lot</em> of people aren't even following the rules. And they're not being enforced that heavily in most places, atleast in the US.</p>

<p>I’m going to assume that perhaps you had no one in your life die of this virus.</p>

        <p>I had someone in my life that died that they SAID died of the virus...but he had stage 4 liver cancer and doctors gave him 6 months to live...he lived for 2 years! He died in his sleep and a post mortem Covid test was positive...so,Covid it is! </p>
<p>When you have medical examiners coming out into the media saying they have heart attacks,strokes,car accidents and gunshot wound victims counted as Covid deaths,like in Colorado and Illinois among others and the CDC admits that about 6% of the huge ever growing number the media claims died of this virus ACTUALLY died of this virus,people need to wake up and smell the coffee. I don’t know what else people need to know to realize you’ve been taken for a mug on this virus. The only science involved in the overblown response to this virus was POLITICAL science. The same people that screamed we had to shut it all down will NOW say “it’s ok,open back up” then try to take credit for the economy that they stifled! All to take down a president...if I were in the group that bought a not this bullshit I wouldn’t want admit I was duped either.</p>
<p>Fact is that MOST people are alive to lament this...MOST people didn’t even get it,or didn’t know they had it...and MOST,about 99.97% that HAD it,lived. I would think that would be a GOOD thing...but for some reason there can BE no light at the end of this tunnel. You are allowed no hope...it MUST be fear and fear alone!</p>

        <p>I won’t disagree that this shit has sucked. I want to go out to a bar and hang out with my friends without this doom and gloom hanging over our heads. I also won’t disagree that much of the hysteria has been sensationalized by the media and corrupted by politicians looking for more votes, don’t even get me started on electoral politics lol. </p>
<p>This nonsense about vaccine passports??? Fucking stupidest shit I’ve ever heard. It seems everyone is fine with a little authoritarianism as long as it benefits them. Maybe this makes me a hypocrite because I supported some mask mandates or at the least, business’ choosing to serve only masked customers. </p>
<p>All that being said I am just as ready as the rest of you to get back to “normal” whatever that might be. I know in my past comments I compare this pandemic to the plague but this has been the closest we may ever come to one with the technology and procedures we have available to us and specifically the unpredictable ness of the virus that we saw. So many people got away with mild or super shitty flu symptoms and I’m so grateful for that. Others were not so lucky. </p>
<p>But I really can’t bring myself to believe that this was constructed in any way to deprive us of our liberties. Maybe that’s privileged of me for saying. </p>
<p>Not sure where this was going tbh but I also like my username so there’s that lol</p>

        <p>Some months ago there was data coming out that was indicating there were no excess deaths when compared to previous years. They've apparently corrected this oversight. But it will be interesting to see the next several years when there are less deaths due to the herd having been culled, so to speak. The loss of human life is always difficult especially for the loved ones. But it is unavoidable. The loss of liberty is avoidable though. Maintaining a decent quality of life is possible for those that aren't at serious threat. </p>
<p>Instead they're confiscating freedom and destroying quality of life for billions around the world to buy unhealthy people a little bit longer before the inevitable occurs.</p>

        <p>number of deaths in the US for 2020 was on par with the trends over the last decade. basically everyone who died of covid has been overweight or obese, why should i radically change my life because others havent taken care of themselves?</p>
<p>I’m going to assume you had no one in your life die of a drug overdose or suicide because they were forced to isolate in their homes for months.</p>

Would you say that giving people a ticket for no seatbelt is infringing upon your rights? You literally can't affect anyone else by not wearing a seatbelt yet its still illegal. How about drinking and driving is that okay? Seems like my right to drink and drive is being infringed upon.

<p>Inversely...just because you think your rights are NOT being infringed doesn’t mean that they’re not.</p>
<p>If you can’t work,shop,travel or participate in commerce because of a unilateral,made up,arbitrary set of rules and restrictions that weren’t based on any solid scientific data THAT is infringement! These restrictions are not laws. They weren’t voted on by our representatives...if there WAS all this indisputable evidence,and the situation was SO urgent why weren’t the facts given to our representatives and then voted on? If it really WAS and IS all about public health and safety,why are the official recommendations for masks the LEAST effective masks? 6 feet of social distancing was entirely made up...3 feet was the known standard and ended up back at what was known to be effective,but only AFTER businesses and lives were ruined. Denial of what was done to this country and attempting to justify it isn’t going to help ensure this doesn’t happen again.</p>

        <p>And there we have my point. Did China keep their lockdowns when they could've just lied about the numbers? And what about N Korea? According to them they haven't had ANY cases of Covid (which is horse shit btw) but wouldn't they lie the opposite way? You're theories make no sense on a basic level you have to figure out the simple first before you jump into crazy conspiracy land.</p>

        <p>So...my theories don’t make any sense...but you believe China’s official death count? A communist country that controls ALL information that goes into the media...a country that built entire cities nobody lives on to make it seem like it was successful and growing? The fact that communist countries lied about their infection rates and deaths DOESNT shock me. What bothers me is that they lied to show lower or no deaths and WE are lying to make it seem much worse than it actually is. Even the CDC says the numbers are wrong...but it’s a conspiracy? It DEFINITELY is a conspiracy...you’d have to be crazy to think it wasn’t. I’m basing my opinion on medical evidence and scientific evidence that existed BEFORE March of 2020...I formed my opinions based on what I see in the real world. When non lockdown countries and states ended up with statistically identical numbers of deaths and infections to places that locked people inside and shit everything down that’s CLEAR evidence that the lockdown measures and everything except hand washing and sanitization were ineffective and unnecessary to combat a virus.</p>
<p>Questions: what order from a single,unilateral entity would you NOT follow? What pandemic in history ever quarantined healthy people who weren’t infected or sick?  How did known science that masks didn’t effectively stop of slow the spread of viral infection do a 180 literally over night?  What other pandemic had a PR campaign? What other pandemic or crisis offered zero hope or positivity?  Why wasn’t universal masking used in any other pandemic? How did we get a vaccine for this virus in 10 months of its discovery ,but the original SARS 19 years ago nor any other coronavirus for that matter) never had a vaccine that was effective after decades of research? What other vaccine that was judged as effective and safe requires the continuous use of ppe?</p>
<p>I know the answers to these questions...but answer them HONESTLY for yourself and then tell me I’m a crazy conspiracy theorist.</p>

        <p>Just like today,back then the people against forced masks were small in numbers...but vindicated in the end. The mask mandates back then were based on what we know...or at least knew to be flawed 19th century science. Today we know viruses transmit via aerosols that masks do not stop.</p>

        <p>If you take the authors bias out THIS is what is important and what actually matters at the end of the day.... Although the Surgeon General of the US Navy acknowledged that wearing masks by hospital staff was good practice, “the morbidity rate, nevertheless, was very high among those attending the sick,” and may only have prevented infection from a direct, close hit from a cough or sneeze of a patient. The protocols followed in the contagious annex of the US Naval Hospital in Annapolis, MD, were sufficient to prevent cross-contamination of “cerebro-spinal fever” (aka meningitis), diphtheria, measles, mumps, scarlet fever, and German measles. Not so with influenza. In fact, the infection rate of staff was as high in the high-protocol wards as in the improvised hospitals. In one improvised hospital at the Navy Training Station in Great Lakes, IL., the infection rate was higher among those corpsmen and volunteers who wore masks than those who did not!(excerpt)</p>
<p>The masks offer marginal protection...which is the same as none. They DO protect against direct sprays of someone coughing or sneezing directly onto your face...but the main method of transmission is via exhaled and inhaled aerosols that can hang suspended in the air for hours or longer. They can definitely travel more than 6 feet and readily absorb through the eyes and other mucous membranes...it’s not my opinion it’s a scientific fact.</p>

        <p>Here’s what you’re not seeing...in China,people have no rights other than what the government gives them...in America,our constitution doesn’t give us rights or limit them...the constitution puts limits on GOVERNMENT...I have had a constitutional law course and can’t find anything in there that gives government the power to shut down the economy over a virus.</p>
