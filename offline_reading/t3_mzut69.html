    <strong>Just me talking about my struggles lately if anyone is interested</strong>
    <p><p>This is officially the worst point of my life I feel so conflicted and worried about my future. Most my life I have been like everyone else around me in my community. I believed everything I saw and heard and I did not research anything and just formed my opinion on the info provided. I was like this up until mid last year where I saw how they keep lying about police footage and whatnot. And with this pretty much mandatory vaccine going to be it soon I’m just so conflicted. My reasoning for this is they definitely lie about other news why wouldn’t they lie and cover up vaccine side effects and info. I have gotten all my vaccines my whole life I even got some just last year in February and about 2 weeks later I developed this severe tinnitus symptoms out of nowhere. I did. Not have any exposure to a really loud noise or anything it just came one day when I woke up. I don’t know if I should blame it on the vaccine I don’t really want to but I see no other way. I also went to the doctor and my hearing is more than fine and my ears are very clean.  (I got 2 of them one for hpv and another for meningococcal). Anyway the reason I’m so conflicted and concerned is that I really don’t want to lose my friends because I haven’t got the vaccine and I honestly don’t want to. It pains me to be labeled an anti vaxxer cause I don’t want to get this vaccine. I want to go out and live life like normal again (I’m 17 by the way) but this country turning into a dystopian nightmare. I don’t know how much more I can take. All my friends and family are more leaning towards the left in terms of political views and me personally I don’t like politics at all and don’t pick a side. But you already know how it is if you even attempt to hear out a different side of a story that isn’t what they want to hear. I’m just really concerned for myself at the moment. Thanks for reading.</p></p>

        <p>You don’t have to GET the vaccine to say that you did. If losing some friendships isn’t something you can handle now, just say “Oh yeah, I got it.” Ive been telling people who ask I’m “waiting bc of my age” because yeah I’m not looking to fight some brainwashed weirdos out in public over this shit.</p>

        <p>Tinnitus is a common symptom of mercury poisoning which vaccines contain so could be. Form your own views and stand your ground, I lost a lot of friends cos of this covid situation but oh well fuck it. I don't want to hang out with media and state worshipping weirdos who will attack me simply because I don't follow the crowd. Luckily alot of my friend think the whole thing is a load of shit and won't go anywhere near the jab, there are more of us than you think many just don't speak out because they are scared of judgement.</p>

        <p>So I just had an appointment with my therapist about this yesterday. I gave myself hives and intense stomach issues because I've been so stressed out about my future!!</p>
<p>The best advice he gave me was to make sure you balance out the negative with the positives. There's a lot of unknowns right now (and there always will be) and we can give ourselves anxiety when we only focus on what we do not know. </p>
<p>It's so much easier said than done but try to remove yourself from the news, from researching, from social media for a little bit. </p>
<p>It's hard to avoid the covid stuff since it's right in front of our face always. But vaccines aren't mandated yet. So we need not worry about it until it does happen. </p>
<p>There are some things that you will miss out on because of not getting vaccinated. Friends may not want to hang out with you anymore, you may have to pay an extra $60 to get tested before going to sporting events, etc. But you must accept the things you cannot control. Acceptance is key to releasing stress. </p>
<p>In my opinion, I can accept the results of my actions because I believe i am making the right decision for myself. And that is good enough for me. I do not fear judgement from others because they do not and may not ever understand my reasoning for why I do what I do. But I am confident in my decision and my choice to stay true to myself. And I hope you will be too..</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense! I feel so much lighter now</p>

        <p>Thanks for this but I still have a long way to go until I accept stuff. I am unbelievably conflicted and I sometimes tell myself the things I believe and think about are completely ridiculous and why would they be true. I desperately don’t want to be hated by everyone I love and care about but I just can’t bring myself to take it.</p>

        <p>Dude I feel you so much. It is a hard pill to swallow. I feel to accept it is to like, lie down and take it. 
But that's not the case. Your priority before anything else is to take care of yourself. Sort of like, put your oxygen mask on before helping others. </p>
<p>Once you find your calm and peace amongst the shit storm that is going on, you will be able to help others. </p>
<p>As of right now, it is so blatantly clear that no one wants to hear anything from anyone who holds the beliefs we do. We don't want the vaccine so we are obviously idiots, anti Vax, anti science, q anon supporters, selfish, willfully ignorant, etc. </p>
<p>I know that's not true, you know that's not true, and that's all we can really hold on to right now. To continue to "fight back" is an uphill battle. There's not much we can do really. Just stay in the present moment. </p>
<p>You don't have to convince anyone of anything.</p>

        <p>I know :( it is hard. You have to forgive yourself, you didn't know what you know now. And accept that later down the line, you may be wrong again. You are more than just your beliefs. </p>
<p>The hardest part of all this is the interpersonal relationships, I agree. I don't have much advice on that. It does suck not being friends or friendly with people over something like this. </p>
<p>That's why the most important thing you can do is just be true to yourself. I've done sooooo much research, probably more research than most, and I am confident in my decision and that's really all I have, man. </p>
<p>I'm willing to accept that if new information is brought to light, I would be willing to change my mind. And I won't be mad at myself for doing what I thought was right for me at the time. </p>
<p>I hope that makes sense. I'm here if you just want to vent, sorry if my advice is unwarranted bc sometimes I hate when ppl give me advice lol. I just felt like I had to share because I was struggling pretty bad too until recently. And hey, if it is feasible for you, I highly recommend therapy because it's been so so so so helpful for me. A good therapist won't judge you, they'll just help you manage your stress.</p>

        <p>No it really does help especially now cause I’m sick to my stomach and yeah I was wondering about that and if therapists would immediately judge me for saying some of these things. I would completely understand initially because they do sound ridiculous but I was always hesitant about going to a therapist because of stuff like this. How was your experience?</p>

        <p>Yeah it's crazy how it's been so we researched how much stress comes into play when it comes to our health. High cortisol levels weaken the immune system, ironic how none of that is being talked about despite the current state of affairs 🙄🙄 I've always been highly anxious and I've always had stomach issues, been to hospitals so many times for it only for them to do nothing and leave me with a fat bill. It was only recently I learned the many ways stress manifests itself in the physical body. </p>
<p>I've been going to my therapist on and off for a few years. The first year I went to him I only really made like 3 appointments. I would go to one appt and then not schedule one again bc I was so embarrassed. Tbh, I'm actually really grateful for telehealth now because I think it's been way easier for me to go to therapy now that it's online. It's easier for me to open up. This past appointment was my only time bringing up covid and where I stand with the vaccine. He was very professional, if he judged me for it, I couldn't tell. </p>
<p>We did some role-playing where he pretended to be someone calling me stupid for my choice so I can practice handling it in a non stressful way. And we talked about managing stress, accepting the things we cannot change, staying in the present moment.</p>
<p>It's so easy to snowball out of control, thinking about where the fuck our future is headed. It may be bad in the future, but it also may not be so bad. </p>
<p>I also HIGHLY recommend checking out Russell Brand on YouTube. He's someone who posts a lot about what the MSM is hiding from us, and watching all his videos can be very stressful lol. BUT he also balances it out with meditation, anti anxiety videos, and basically how to remain at peace despite the chaos that is going on around us.</p>

        <p>I was forced to take a meningococcal vaccine in high school and immediately developed food and seasonal allergies within 48 hours. I’m never getting another vaccine.</p>
<p>There’s a history of Pfizer being sued relentlessly in the past and the FDA being caught up for falsifying vaccine results and safety reviews. I’ll go down swinging before they stick another needle in me.</p>

        <p>Honestly I can’t say if the bad side effects are real or not but what I’ve seen of the heart problems with the J and j vaccine makes me think in the future more can pop up. That and the thing with the tinnitus which some people report that they have had it after taking some other vaccines like me and the two I took in February last year.</p>

        <p>The best you can do is hold your ground.  If enough people resist, they won't be able to haul us off to the camps, it would get too messy.  Once you are in an easily splintered minority, you can be taken out.</p>
<p>The way forward is painful and full of isolation.  I pray for people's hearts to soften and to recognize the humanity in those with concerns. I'm not hopeful, but it's all I have no.  Maybe there's still a chance that some people will come around and feel comforted enough in their own personal choices to not view us as a threat.</p>

        <p>Learn to not give a shit what people think. A "friend" thinks you're a selfish anti vaxer because you don't want an experimental medical treatment for a disease you're at virtually no risk for? Fuck them.</p>
<p>Everyone on Insta wants you to post a black square and if you don't, that makes you a bigot? Fuck them. That's their problem.</p>
<p>Don't engage in debates. You don't have to justify yourself to anyone. I'm twice your age and wish I would have given less of a shit at 17. The friends you have now are very likely going to transition out of your life by the time you're my age anyway.</p>
