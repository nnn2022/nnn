    <strong>Seems fishy</strong>
    <p><p>Let me start this post by saying that I took the jab. Reason being, that if it means we can be done with this shit, I will get it. </p>
<p>My reason for this post though is involving a woman at work and her young child. Neither have or ever will get the covid vaccine.</p>
<p>About a month ago, the kid was running a fever, no cold symptoms other than the fever and slightly tired/fussy. When they went to the doctor they looked in his ears like they normally would and saw inflammation and determined he had an ear infection. They prescribed him an antibiotic. Before they left the office they suggested he take a covid test. That covid test meant my friend had to stay out of work waiting on the results-which took 4 days. </p>
<p>Yesterday the same kid has a pretty bad cold. Snotty, bad cough, red eyes, miserable. Same doctors office. Didnâ€™t suggest a covid test. </p>
<p>Hmmmmmm...</p></p>
