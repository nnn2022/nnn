    <strong>How can I avoid getting the vaccine as a minor?</strong>
    <p><p>I am 17, and parents are completely on board with the vaccine, and are going to force me to get one, how can I prevent this they won’t listen to reason. Live in Mass if that helps.</p></p>

        <p>Just say No.</p>
<p>If they ask you why, just say that you don't want to. If they keep asking, just tell them calmly that they should please respect your decision.</p>
<p>No need to get into some elaborate argument. Arguments are useless with such people. You could print out the FDA studies, CDC comorbidity statistics, CoViD survival numbers for your people, chance to even have any symptoms from CoVid, WHO study about asymptomatic spread being rare, etc. — it won't help a single bit.</p>
<p>So just say No. Don't argue. Don't shout or be loud. Don't threaten. Just say No.</p>

<p>On a serious note though you’re less than one year away from having your own legal autonomy… tell em you refuse to get it until its FDA approved in 2023 and that you’re not even in a risk group. If they can’t respect that, do everything in your power to hold your ground.</p>

        <p>Serious answer: Check mature minor laws in your state. Some places are as low as 14yo, but most places will have provisions in place for a 16/17yo. Depending on how close you are to your 18th birthday, you may find out that unless it’s a procedure that requires parental consent (such as abortions or life saving measures if you were in a car accident), your parents may not have any more power over your medical care. </p>
<p>Next, you can ALWAYS tell your doctor that you don’t want something when you’re alone in the exam room. They have no legal obligation to inform your parents even if you are a minor, unless you are doing something that will be charged to their insurance, which is the anxiety a lot of girls have over birth control- or that requires their consent like the above examples, but if that’s not a concern they won’t and in some cases, CAN’T tell your parents that you refused the vaccine. Vaccine is FREE and not charged to any insurance- so your parents insurance will only see a charge for the appointment. </p>
<p>Try not to go to a pharmacy, because it’s more likely your parents will be there with you, and they aren’t legally bound as doctors are. If your parents insist on doing it there because they can see you, just insist on a doctors appointment- and try to lump it in with other concerns, like  saying that you want to do a college physical with a doctor, get your college vaccines, etc. and that they will give you the covid vaccine there. As long as you’re alone in that room, your doctor will have a duty to keep confidential certain things you don’t want your parents to know. </p>
<p>Ironically I learned a lot of this stuff following the cases of kids who wanted things like measles and polio vaccines that their parents didn’t let them get, it works in reverse too. Just check the laws online and try to get an appointment with your doctor by yourself.</p>

        <p>I think the reality is that your parents are legally allowed to make your health decisions until you're 18. That being the case, I think your best bet would be to tell them that you don't want it, and explain to them that it's your body so it should be your choice to decide what kind of medical treatment you want to receive. I don't think that they will physically compel you, and I don't think anybody would actually vaccinate you if you told them you didn't want it and resisted.</p>
<p>I plan to get a vaccine myself. Everything I've seen and experienced in my 35 years (twice as many as you) has convinced me that every other vaccine I've ever gotten is fine, and I haven't seen anything that makes me afraid to get a COVID vaccine. There's plenty of scary stuff in this subreddit and others like it, but the more I look into it the more comfortable I am with the COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>But I think it should be up to you to decide for yourself. So I think that's your best angle of approaching it with your parents. Maybe they feel like I do.</p>
