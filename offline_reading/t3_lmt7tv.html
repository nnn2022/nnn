    <strong>I'm a Sheep - Help me understand</strong>
    <p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm truly being inquisitive and trying to understand the current climate with regards to the COVID19 virus. I have some questions though that I'd like to ask "skeptics" and get some honest feedback on. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The COVID Virus is a Novel virus - meaning it's never been recorded in Humans as a species - this is according to the knowledge I have currently. My first question is this: If this virus has no history in Humans shouldn't we be weary of it and take precautions? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The virus doesn't care about liberty and social norms. It is a virus and it's only job is to replicate and spread. As a community - as a species, shouldn't we come together and use the information in a responsible manner and help protect Humans and the society we once coveted so much and if so what does that look like? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The vaccine as question is broad. I don't suppose we'll ever truly understand the facts of it for decades.  I understand that this is a personal choice to either have the vaccine or not. My question about the vaccine is if you don't plan on getting it; may I ask what your scientific or personal rationale is? I'm very interested to inform myself about this topic. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I guess my last question (for now) is; if the virus is threatening the whole population (you can get COVID19 and be asymptomatic but that doesn't stop it from spreading to a vulnerable individual) .. shouldn't we look at it as a global population rather than individuals? The World has shrunk so much in the last 40 years ... planes, trains, personal transport. You can fly around the world within a few days. This is what is leading to multiple variants intermixing and possibly creating a hybrid variant which we are now seeing in California and the West Coast. So to the question; shouldn't we work as global citizens to stop this pandemic together? Does a mask pose that much interference to liberty that it's worth the risk to the global population? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any feedback and references you might have to help me educate to your point of view. I'm here to listen; not to judge and I hope that this is taken in that light.</p></p>

        <p>A. It's not a novel virus.  </p>
<p>B. It doesn't care about liberty, but humans do.</p>
<p>C. We can take precautions.  That also doesn't mean shutting down all of society?</p>
<p>D. I don't need a vaccine, because I have an immune system.  This is called science.</p>

        <p>A) As I mentioned before it’s never been seen in the genetic history of Humans. According to the W.H.O. a novel corona virus is classified as “A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans”. I’m sorry if my question was misleading. I didn’t mean the virus itself was Novel. </p>
<p>B) I’m not sure how this answers my question. </p>
<p>C) What do you feel would be proper in the way we handle the precautions and society during this Pandemic. </p>
<p>D) Vaccines are proven science. I’m not willing to entertain the the idea that Vaccines don’t work when they have been proven through history to work. Now if you have an cogent argument about Vaccine Efficacy or mRNA being new; I’ll listen but simply saying Vaccines aren’t needed is obtuse.</p>

<p>Like every virus, ever.</p>
<p>&rt;According to the W.H.O. a novel corona virus is classified as “A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans”.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>&rt;B) I’m not sure how this answers my question. </p>
<p>This is a virus.  How we handle it is up to us.  There are more things to life than a virus.  </p>
<p>&rt;C) What do you feel would be proper in the way we handle the precautions and society during this Pandemic. </p>
<p>As I've said numerous times.  Let people decide their own level of risk.  If I decide I'm not at risk, and I get the virus, that's good!  That means I have now eliminated a vector.  If enough young and healthy people do this, we will eliminate spread.</p>
<p>Let the young and healthy go out and enjoy their lives.  Quarantine is for the sick, not the healthy.</p>
<p>&rt;D) Vaccines are proven science.</p>
<p>This isn't a vaccine.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A year of data in science is not sufficient to come to certain conclusions. Forecasts are estimates of science based on current information. They are ambiguous because they are based off limited data sets. Can you give me a link or reference to where you got your information from so I can observe it? </p>

<p>Again I would love to see your data on this so I may understand more your point of view and how you came to your conclusion. </p>

        <p>My concern with the vaccine is that it is also a new type of vaccine. it functions by altering/modifying your messenger RNA and I’m not willing to be part of the study on how it affects the human body in the short and long term.</p>
<p>Edit: I have nothing against vaccines. It’s this one that worries me with it being pushed out quickly, and the manufacturer takes no fault in the potential damages that can come from it.</p>

        <p>This is one of my major concerns as well. There has been no animal testing, no human testing. Essentially we're the BETA test. That scares me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>AstraZeneca's vaccine is a "traditional" vaccine. It does not use mRNA delivery system. I was thinking about headed in that direction IF I do decide to move forward with it.</p>

        <p>All of these questions seem to be based on the false premise that it is dangerous. You're not alone in being tricked into thinking that. Correcting that faulty premise resolves all of the questions.</p>
<p>&rt;The COVID Virus is a Novel virus - meaning it's never been recorded in Humans as a species - this is according to the knowledge I have currently. My first question is this: If this virus has no history in Humans shouldn't we be weary of it and take precautions?</p>
<p>The people telling you this are being deliberately misleading. This specific virus is new, but the type of virus is not. Most importantly, the fact that a specific virus is new is pretty meaningless. For example, last year's flu was a novel virus, as was the flu the year before that, and the one before that, and so on. When you catch a cold, your body is responding to one of millions of novel variations of a group we call cold viruses.</p>
<p>&rt;The virus doesn't care about liberty and social norms. It is a virus and it's only job is to replicate and spread. As a community - as a species, shouldn't we come together and use the information in a responsible manner and help protect Humans and the society we once coveted so much and if so what does that look like?</p>
<p>The people telling you this are appealing to your emotion. They're leaving out the fact that we deal with nearly identical diseases all of the time and have done so since before civilization and that the response that they are seeking is extremely disproportionate. </p>
<p>&rt;The vaccine as question is broad. I don't suppose we'll ever truly understand the facts of it for decades. I understand that this is a personal choice to either have the vaccine or not. My question about the vaccine is if you don't plan on getting it; may I ask what your scientific or personal rationale is? I'm very interested to inform myself about this topic.</p>
<p>I'm not getting it because I've already had it. If I hadn't, I still wouldn't, because I am not a person who is at risk and I do not work very closely with those who are. As far as we know, it's a harmless but pointless thing for the majority of people.</p>
<p>&rt;So to the question; shouldn't we work as global citizens to stop this pandemic together?</p>
<p>The people telling you this are also being deliberately misleading. The term "pandemic" conjures up images of danger due to its use in the movies, but, in reality, it just means something is found over a wide geographic area. We experience hundreds of pandemics every year. It would be impossible to stop them and the benefit to stopping them would be nominal.</p>
<p>&rt;Does a mask pose that much interference to liberty that it's worth the risk to the global population?</p>
<p>There is no risk to the global population and a mask doesn't change the risk either way.</p>

<li>The coronavirus is just a deadlier version of the flu. People die from it, but a majority of the deaths that have been counted are typically from other causes. It even states in the counting method that a Covid death is anyone who has had Covid in the last 28 days. </li>
<li>Numerous studies have disproven the effects of asymptomatic spread. </li>
<li>This virus is only truly deadly to those over 65 or with preexisting conditions. If you are not in either category, you have a 99% chance of surviving Covid and will likely get mild to no symptoms. </li>
<li>If the lockdowns and masks have not worked to contain the virus in the last year, what makes you think it will happen now, especially since we represent a small minority of the world. </li>
<li>Humans have never worried about each other's health before. I care about my health. You care about yours.</li>
<li>The vaccine literally changes your DNA and RNA with unknown long-term effects. I am likely to get more severe symptoms from the vaccine than I am the actual virus. </li>
<li>If the virus is so deadly, how come none of us have died from it and there are nurses dancing on Tik Tok?</li>
<li>Assuming the death numbers are correct (they're not), the virus has killed .12% of the population while the 1918 Spanish flu killed .65% of the population making it 5.4 times deadlier. </li>
<li>Masks will never really work because 324 million people will have to wear them correctly without touching them or removing them in public while also washing them twice a week which is literally impossible for everyone to do</li>
<li>The CDC itself admitted most masks aren't that effective because now they are recommending TWO</li>
<li>Most people, including me, are done wasting their youth and being in a struggling economy for a virus that has been overblown by the media and only affects a small portion of the population.</li>

        <p>There is no "novel" coronavirus that was discovered in 2019. The so called SARS-COV2 has NEVER been isolated.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses have existed for thousands of years. In 2019 the world decided to rename the common cold to enslave the sheep. That's all there is to it. </p>
<p>Constant 24/7 brainwashing has worked so amazingly that the average sheep these days will describe the symptoms of common cold, including loss of smell, and call it cOvId.</p>

        <p>I'd like to know more about how you came to the conclusion that the COVID has never been isolated. What do mean by this? I'd like to hear more. </p>

<p>Can you give me some reliable sources for your information regarding the common cold and the COVID Virus? How are they the same? How is the World's governments using this Pandemic to exert control? </p>

        <p>yeah if you wanna be careful because of it thats fine with me. I’m even in support of working from home if you can and choose to do so. i don’t like the ever increasing authoritarianism. they’re trying to control us, using the virus as an excuse.</p>

        <p>So, for you personally, the current safety measures are a sign of reduction of Liberties moving forward? Can you explain your position a little bit more? I’m curious about the “control” mechanism and how do you feel it will be presented in the future to the population. The “mask mandate” has other ramifications beyond being a simple health objective? I’m interested in learning more from you should you like to respond :).</p>

        <p>yeah, i don’t think any of it makes sense. the biggest risk factor for getting, spreading, and dying from covid in the US is obesity. i think we would benefit a lot more from moving more and eating better, ive seen no such messaging since the pandemic started. i think its an excuse to get everyone to stay inside because it crushes people and small business.</p>

        <p>Here's the fundamental problem.
In pandemics, the following happens: more people than normal die because of (a) the virus itself and/or (b) the government/social/economic reaction to the virus.  There's <em>no</em> scenario in which <em>both</em> (a) and (b) can be minimized, and to a large extent they are mutually exclusive - if you don't shut down, additional people will die from the virus, and if you DO shut down additional people will die from effects of shutting down (for example, lack of access from non-covid healthcare, suicide from isolation, food insecurity, lack of shelter, etc.)</p>
<p>In other words, people will die one way or the other, and it sucks.  Period.   <em>This is what people have a hard time coming to grips with</em> </p>
<p>Therefore the best approach is the one that is the least impactful to the greatest number of people possible. Which is to not shut down.  Shutting down creates all manner of ancillary effects that have terrible consequences for literally billions of people worldwide.  10s, if not 100s of millions are falling into destitution. Kids can't get a <em>viable</em> education.  Mental health issues are rampant.  Crime is increasing.  And so on. Taken together, these things have MUCH worse implications for the future of humanity than additional virus deaths would. </p>
<p>On top of that, it's very clear governments/oligarchs around the world are using it to their advantage, and don't actually care who they harm along the way.  Amazon's income has steadily increased during this time, while small businesses are dying left and right.  Governments are forcing 1984-style restrictions, like needing proof of vaccination to enter a public place at all.</p>
<p>On top of all of that, the science is VERY clear at this point - unless you are old or otherwise unhealthy, you have essentially NOTHING to fear from the virus, other than feeling sick for a while. In other words, the substantial majority of people have nothing to fear.</p>

        <p>&rt;If this virus has no history in Humans shouldn't we be weary of it and take precautions?</p>
<p>As with any virus, illness or disease, we should all be weary and take precautions! Most definitely, but that does not mean you force your will on others even if it is for the "common good."</p>
<p>&rt;As a community - as a species, shouldn't we come together and use the information in a responsible manner and help protect Humans and the society we once coveted so much and if so what does that look like?</p>
<p>Yes, we should come together, there is no doubt in my view that we should. Unfortunately, there group of people out there, call them the Deep State, the Powers that Be, the elites, etc., that want to control the information and use it against humanity for their own gains, and nefarious reasons. However, there is a resistance to them, and you are seeing it by people protesting, ignoring the new normal, and this sub-reddit.</p>
<p>Now, you have States like Florida and South Dakota that are using the information responsibly, and look at the results! They are flourishing, and they are protecting freedom, while responding accordingly to the SCAMdemic. Of course, you have States like California, and New York, where their respective governors have misused their power, the information and have very successfully ran their States to the ground economically.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;My question about the vaccine is if you don't plan on getting it; may I ask what your scientific or personal rationale is? I'm very interested to inform myself about this topic.</p>
<p>I do not plan on getting it. For several reasons. One, you have a 99% survival rate to this alleged virus. Two, if you have several comorbidities, AND have a unhealthy lifestyle, you are more likely to be affected; I do not fit into this category.</p>
<p>Thirdly, most vaccines, if not all, requires years of testing. As much as I like President Trump, unfortunately, I do not think it was a wise idea to incentivize Big Pharma with government contracts to make a rushed vaccine with little testing. </p>
<p>Fourth, there is a reason why you do not fly an airplane without testing it thoroughly. Why? Because in the unlikely event that something goes wrong, people will get hurt, or worse die. Look at the results of reports of people having adverse affects to the vaccines and that being under reported by the media.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So to the question; shouldn't we work as global citizens to stop this pandemic together? </p>
<p>Any threat to humanity, we should always strive to work together not as "global citizens" but as humanity. We should always strive to protect the vulnerable, as long as they consent to that protection.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I'm here to listen; not to judge and I hope that this is taken in that light.</p>
<p>I, personally, appreciate that you are willing to at least listen to what we have to say. We don't hate you, or people who believe in differently that we do. Do we believe you are misguided? Yes, but that is not a reason to hate you or people who believe similarly to you. What we despise are people who take it upon themselves to be the mask police, or forcing their will on others, on people who do not consent.</p>
<p>I have a best friend, a good buddy from college, we graduated together. He believes in the mask wearing, and getting the vaccine. I believe in the exact opposite! When we last talked on the phone this past Tuesday, it went like this:</p>
<p><strong>Friend</strong>: You know, the mask works, you should wear it in public!<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: I have done my research, it is not designed to be worn like they are suggesting in the news. And honestly, I don't like that they are forcing it on people.</p>
<p><strong>Friend</strong>: You should wear it, because the "experts" say so.<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: Those "experts" flipped flopped so many times; I don't trust them!</p>
<p><strong>Friend</strong>: Oh, by the way, are we still meeting for breakfast on Saturday morning? The twins want to see you!<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: Of course dude, haven't seen you guys in weeks! What time? Still looking at 11am?</p>
<p><strong>Friend</strong>: Oh, okay, yeah 11am! Good, we'll talk more, and I'll let the boys know!<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: Cool man, can't wait to see the boys, and you guys! We'll pick up where we left off. Stay safe bro!  </p>
<p>&rt;Does a mask pose that much interference to liberty that it's worth the risk to the global population?</p>
<p>It is not that mask poses an interference to liberty, it is the fact that it is being forced. I have no problems with the mask. As a matter of fact, in my view, if you believe that the mask protects you, fine! Wear it until you heart's content, that is your right provided that you have made an informed decision. In other words, you did your own research, and you have weighed the pros, and cons of wearing the medical device. HOWEVER, should you choose to not wear it, like myself and many others, it is because we have come to the conclusion, that while wearing the mask may work for you, it will not work for us.</p>
