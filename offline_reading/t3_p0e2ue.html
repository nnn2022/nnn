    <strong>Random Sunday Rant! This circus we are living</strong>
    <p><p>I apologize ahead of time for any inconsistencies or spelling errors lol. I just felt like ranting this Sunday morning, </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So we have to endure the division created by the governments (non vaxxed vs vaxxed). Plus all the adverse effects being silenced by MSM from the Death Jab. Plus all mass censoring across the board of the medical community that dares to tell the truth about what these shots are doing to people now and going to do to people. But now I have been hearing more and more, that the incoming Cyber Attacks are not only meant to crush our networking all together, as we are stronger united than alone. I am hearing that they are gonna fuck with the banking systems and our money. Not only FIAT will be wiped off the system or stolen...but Cryptocurrency is largely a part of this plan, how can you save digital currency if we have no access to the digital realm...so they pump the market, then get all us average citizens to invest all our savings. Being advised to take all my money out of my bank and crypto wallets as this could happen way sooner than I initially anticipated. If this Cyber Attack does what it intends to do...we have lost everything in terms of financial means of living. Then onto the power outages and mass food shortages, it will never end until we are at war with all of our neighbors. These megalomaniac tyrants need to fuck right off. Funny how everything Klaus Schwab or Kill Gates "predicts" comes true...fuck coincidences! This was always their goal...Genocide. This is depopulation at it's finest, ladies and gentlemen. Masked by a "virus" they cannot isolate, this was never about COVID19 (<strong>Certificate of Vaccination Identification by Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong>1=A and 9=I</strong>)) . I am legit worried about the next 6 months as winter will surely have a mass effect on the vaxxed, considering they are already catching "COVID" worse than ever. Stay safe everyone and enjoy what is left of summer!</p></p>

        <p>The end is near this was all predicted, keep your spirituality strong this is not the time to panic. Calm your mind friend, a prayer for you.</p>
<p>Prayer of Saint Francis</p>
<p>Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy.
O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.
Amen.</p>

        <p>I too was wondering how bad cold and flu season will affect the vaxxed, seeing as their bodies are constantly under an immune response. Bet you though they won't put covid on death certs or supply any statistics.</p>

        <p>If this is our future there’s only so much someone can do. I’d say join the prepping community on Reddit but they’re all about getting the vax</p>
<p>Learn some skills. Use your cash to invest in things that could help just in case. Find like minded people where you live and build a network of others who have skills. <br>
good luck to you. We’re all gonna need it</p>
