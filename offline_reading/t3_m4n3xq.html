        <p>I mean the government fucking sucks. That we can agree on. And yes they should provide a mean and reimbursement for you to stay home and wear a mask. But it is our job. Sorry to say.

        <p>The government can decide to do something about it at any time, they just choose not to, every day that goes by. It‚Äôs never too late for them to provide adequate assistance but they are deliberately choosing not to. That‚Äôs not anyone else‚Äôs fault. They are either lying about how deadly it is or they‚Äôre being complacent and letting it get worse.</p>

        <p>Well just a few days ago they did try. You got a measly 1400 bucks out of it and the minimum wage wasn‚Äôt even increased. If you want my honesty opinion what you are asking for sounds like progressive legislation. Giving out masks for free and providing money for people to stay at home. I‚Äôm all for it. But sadly this is likely not able to pass in a highly conservative nation on basis of calling it ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù so I agree they can make reform whenever they like. There‚Äôs just no certainty on wether or not it will pass</p>

        <p>But do you not agree that if the virus is so deadly and dangerous that they are being complacent by not doing anything? $1400 is not going to last the majority of people very long so I really don‚Äôt wanna give them credit for doing less than the bare minimum. I honestly think if covid was SO dangerous that we could barely leave our homes without dropping dead, no one would need to be ‚Äúmandated‚Äù to stay at home anyway. So my real conclusion is actually that the severity of the whole virus is being grossly overstated for government control. There would be no reason for legislation or any of that shit if we had a real reason to be concerned for our lives. So it‚Äôs more about that for me than it is about them ‚Äúnot doing enough.‚Äù They‚Äôre placing responsibility on the people instead of themselves so that people stay angry and distracted by others instead of questioning their trust in the government.</p>

        <p>How about both? I‚Äôm pissed at people who don‚Äôt wear masks because not only have I but friends I know have been affected by this virus. I think people who do that are narcissistic and are singlehandedly making this last longer than it has to. I also hate my fucking government because it does not provide the support needed to these people. Not only is 1400 dollars not enough but we have had vaccine been given out in richer neighborhoods to garner votes and election money and we‚Äôve also had deaths to the elderly due to abhorrent mismanagement. It‚Äôs fucking disgusting what our government gets away with</p>

        <p>Do you not see tho how the virus can‚Äôt possibly be as scary as they‚Äôve made it out to be? Yes it has affected a lot of people‚Äôs lives but that has mostly to do with the lockdowns and restrictions instead of the virus itself. That ought to tell you that all these governments mandates, in addition to us receiving no actual help from the government adds up to a desperate attempt for mass control. So it makes it really easy to blame people for not staying inside all the time and not wearing masks when you can visibly see that the virus is NOT that deadly. If covid was like the Black Plague, you would have no time to worry about what other people are doing while trying to keep yourself away from it.</p>

        <p>Mm. My music teachers best friend died of it. So I‚Äôd say your argument is false. One of my best friends got terribly sick from it. Sure it didn‚Äôt kill her but I think everyone agrees that getting sick sucks. I think the virus is bad as it‚Äôs made out to be. I don‚Äôt think they could lie about it. If they were then every single doctor would have to be in on it. That seems cartoonish and frankly unbelievable. The government isn‚Äôt as good at silencing people as they are made out to be. And this is a world wide pandemic. Every country‚Äôs doctor would have to be in on it too. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. There‚Äôs the odd doctor that says it‚Äôs not real or something like that but he is usually shut down very quickly by scientific consensus. Until I see a study that is agreed to be true by a majority of the science community I will believe that this virus is as bad as they say it is</p>

        <p>Again. These sounds like progressive reforms that will need to be done to stop this from happening. We would have to make it where these companies can‚Äôt infringe on freedom of speech.

        <p>I didn‚Äôt say people haven‚Äôt been getting sick or dying. I said the majority of the change that has happened in people‚Äôs lives has to do with the restrictions. And the medical industry as a whole, all over the world, consistently profits off of illness. So it‚Äôs not that every doctor is ‚Äúin on it‚Äù but they work for corporations that ARE. And as for the several doctors that have spoken out about it, I question whether to trust so-called ‚Äúscientific consensus‚Äù because why would doctors lie about something like that??? Plus information can still be censored and anyone can be silenced. No one is immune to being silenced so I can‚Äôt say that you‚Äôll ever get that evidence. We have to stop outsourcing truth and just think for ourselves for once about if this whole thing actually makes sense or not. So when I see lockdowns and restrictions and virtue signaling everywhere, but people STILL out and about (whether it be for work or leisure) and not dropping like flies, I will not believe that there‚Äôs a scary plague-like virus out there that‚Äôs deadly enough that we have to stop living our lives for.</p>

        <p>I agree. </p>
<p>Not to mention, I know doctors that have had complaints written  about them to the medical board after speaking out about COVID. They have to undergo investigations and risk <em>losing their medical license.</em> In today‚Äôs cancel culture, I think it‚Äôs easier for physicians to go along with the flow and not question too much. At least then they can keep their jobs. It‚Äôs ridiculous.</p>
