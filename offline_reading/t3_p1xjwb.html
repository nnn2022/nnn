    <strong>Nonpharmaceutical Measures for Pandemic Influenza in Nonhealthcare Settings—Personal Protective and Environmental Measures - Volume 26, Number 5—May 2020 - Emerging Infectious Diseases journal</strong>
    <p><p>I work in medicine as a medical provider and I constantly ask my colleagues to please point out the data that says masks are effective. They never have. Not once. I personally have never found a study with solid evidence supporting their use.Interestingly, I found this CDC paper from May 2020 - right around when they were flip flopping on mask recommendations. The paper reviews known Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs - the GOLD STANDARD of studies) looking at mask effectiveness.Here is what they found:"In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946–July 27, 2018. In pooled analysis, we found NO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION in influenza transmission with the use of face masks."</p>
<p>When mandated to cover your face in public realize it has never been proven to be effective at reducing the transmission of viral illnesses.</p>
<p>The more you know ;-)</p>

        <p>The CDC says that mask mandates reduce COVID by about 1%.</p>
<p>Somehow, they portray that as a big success.</p>

        <p>The problem is they’ve been claiming that masks don’t usually work but as long as you wear yours and I wear mine- the masks will catch spittle and reduce the amount of viral spread, and this is better than nothing. Which doesn’t make sense because it’s aerosolized anyway and even if a few spit particles were blocked- what about the rest? They’re just making things up to keep people in fear by seeing masks over everyone’s faces. If anything the constant mask wearing is increasing illness in people because it’s abnormal for the bodies airways to be covered by dirty fabric all day.</p>

        <p>I've heard a mask versus the covid virus is akin to throwing a shovel full of sand at a chain link fence. Some will get blocked but very little. Plus if they are reducing transmission by say 1% what about the amount of children suffering from increased anxiety? Should the "cure" be worse than the disease? Nope</p>
