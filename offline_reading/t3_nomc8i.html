    <strong>Why do people act like there is absolutely no possibility of there being something wrong with the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>This is one thing that really irks me. People say you’re a conspiracy theorist for even suggesting this vaccine may not be 100% safe. Is it a conspiracy theory to say that new vaccine technology in a vaccine that took less then six months to develop may not be the safest thing in the world? </p>
<p>I’ve heard people say it’s complete safe; we don’t know that, it’s impossible. Just because you don’t have an immediate reaction doesn’t mean you’re safe. We don’t know what could happen to people six months, a year, or ten years from now. Only time will tell if something goes wrong. </p>
<p>I don’t understand the push for everyone to get vaccinated. What happens if 70% of the population gets the vaccine and gets ill, dies, or becomes disabled? I don’t want to carry over half the country if something happens. Same with our military, don’t we want strong servicemen? Less than half of the military should have been able to get it, it shouldn’t be mandatory like they’re pushing now. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. </p>
<p>It’s possible that there could be no illnesses from the vaccine in the future, but it’s also possible there could be. I don’t think it’s wrong to make a plan for the worst-case scenario.</p></p>

        <p>It has to do with their concept of reality.</p>
<p>If any part of this media-constructed reality is shown to be false, then <em>EVERYTHING IS FALSE.</em></p>
<p>This will severely psychologically screw up your average normie. Everything they know and understand about the world will have to be re-thought, re-imagined. That is a colossal amount of effort, and it's terrifying and anxiety-provoking.</p>
<p>That's why most of us have been "truth seeking" before finding this sub, to the point that we can psychologically handle it. "Oh, they're lying about covid. Well, that really fucking sucks, but I'm not surprised -- they've lied about a ton of other things."</p>
<p>For a system-believing normie, it's like waking them up by tossing them into a freezing lake. They'll do anything to avoid that.</p>

        <p>Remember it's also TDS related. They've been shitting on him for 4 long years, to admit media manipulation is to admit they were wrong (and hateful, and dumb) for 4 long years.</p>

        <p>Yeah true. We can see it as just the latest and greatest piece of bullshittery pulled by the psychos behind the scenes. Whats shocking is the magnitude of the lie. And the fact that all governments were immediately on board. It is so extreme I can even begin to see how people might just be purely UNABLE to grasp it. They missed alot of clues along the way apparently. </p>
<p>It makes me angry though that when told the truth repeatedly by someone they know and trust, they still refuse to see. They really think the system will provide them more safety in the end than opposing it. Which might even be true, but at what cost. We are about to find out I think.</p>

        <p>The VAERS site would say differently.  I can’t speak to long term side effects because we don’t have any long term studies to review.  However, that CDC site will show you that the Covid shot has more side effects than the other vaccine that have been around for decades. Is it safe?  Probably.  Is it 100% safe.  Absolutely not.</p>

        <p>We also don’t know if they are shedding and infecting others with whatever is in their blood now (prions?), so I’m staying as far away from the vaccinated as possible at least till the end of the year. At least it’s easy to identify the vaccine cultists, they won’t shut the fuck up about it.</p>

        <p>Same people who profess to hate and not trust the government for numerous other reasons (typically the "systemic isms" that have been in vogue for the past year or so - hmm🤔). But now, oh, yeah, the government is totally legit. They'd never lie about anything. Nope. Government is never malicious towards anyone, never. It's literally impossible.

        <p>Because there have been decades of conditioning people that vaccines are the savior of humanity. No doubt they've saved countless lives, but they were properly vetted. This one has not been properly tested or vetted in any sense of the word, and anyone who says otherwise is an agent of the matrix.</p>

        <p>Right.  You have to at least be philosophically open-minded to the possibility there may be something wrong with the vaccines especially considering the fact that they were developed so quickly.  This shows a lack of critical thinking.</p>

        <p>Related but unrelated. Saline and silicone implants have been around since the 80s. 
Is 2006 silicone implants where allowed back to market after being withdrawn for a few years. 
They made them tear drop or 'gummy bear' shaped to give a more natural look but found the implants would flip and move distorting the shape. So they made the implants textured to give them more grip in the scar pocket.
Allergan, one of the major manufacturers of breast implants, textured implants are increasingly being linked to a rare cancer called BIA ALCL. At an alarming rate.
In the UK, textured implants make up to 90% of all implants. 
The cancer comes 3 - 14 years post op (generally around the 10 year mark). They where withdrawn from sale in 2019. 
I had implants in 2012, they'd been around for decades, I trusted my surgeons advice. I have textured implants made by allergan (not on the official recall list) and now have fluid on the breast which will need testing for cancer (along with other side effects). I'm trying to raise the funds to get my implants removed as cancer was not a side effect I was told. 
I wasn't told because they had dismissed the link for years. I never had the thought process that new and improved means guinea pig. Thousands of woman have ticking time bombs in their bodies. Something that was sold and endorsed by consultant doctors all around the world as completely safe but for many problems are coming 10 years down the line. </p>
<p>No one knows the long term side effects of the vaccine. Ticking timebombs in the millions.</p>

        <p>That is Brainwashing. It's like a form of Stockholm syndrome.
Because they want to believe the lies their government and medical system is telling them. The truth hurts more than believing the lie for now. To admit they've been duped, they'd have to admit most of what they believe is wrong and when they do that their world will crumble.</p>

        <p>You guys want reasons why we think the vaccine is safe, yet you're down voting everyone that actually has reasons why its safe. Look at how many millions of people that have gotten the vaccine and the only somewhat possible complications were the 7 people that died from blood clots and you know what happened? They halted giving out that specific vaccine because thats what the safest thing to do. If that doesn't prove that the medical field isn't taking this seriously and doing things as careful as possible then idk what will get through your heads</p>

        <p>Then your friend is not reading the proper news reports of the massive amounts of people who HAVE been having real danger and that DO outweigh the risks of the virus, considering that 99.8%+ of people who get SARS-CoV-2 <strong>S U R V I V E</strong> !</p>
<p>Time to admit the truth here: We did not need a gene therapy and treatment for a virus that the bulk of people will survive... in fact, almost ALL people who are not over 70 years of age AND have multiple SERIOUS pre-ex's AND are in end-of-life care in nursing homes.</p>

        <p>And they can occasionally come up with some bad medicines, I trust because you can use a keyboard your mother didn't take thalidomide. Vioxx and Acutane stand out as some recent drugs that had bad side effects and needed to be recalled. </p>
<p>Johnson and Johnson had to be sued for millions and millions to stop putting asbestos in their baby powder. No shit, they could have used corn based powder but we're fine with the asbestos laced talc source. </p>
<p>Every company making opiods downplayed the addictive qualities of their drugs, and sold way too much to obvious pill pusher doctors engaging in the criminal. When challenged they added acetaminophen to their drugs, the intent was not therapeutic but was intended to make abuse of their drugs leathal. </p>
<p>The drug companies are smart, but sometimes instead of using their intelligence to swirl beakers around they engage in ruthless and ethic deprived business practices. A covid vaccine in 2020 is worth billions. 2025? Nothing. They all happened to be finished at about the same time, dang that's convenient.</p>

        <p>Ever heard some thing of the "Nürnberger Rassengestze" I don't think so they translate to "the Nürnberg Race laws" which made jews citizens of second class there was no voting right. Not like that was worth anything. They had no more himan rights, all their possessions were taken by state authorities. I doubt that happend to you so quit crying you have never experienced anything like people deemed "undesirable" in the 3rd reich. Even if this virus would be a biological weapon it still isn't that systematic genocide that happened in the polish ghettos and the concentration camps.</p>

<p>They take your stuff away with fines, and expensive PCR tests (up to 100 euro a piece) ... Unvaccinated are starting to become second class citizens, they have restricted access to restaurants, and other public places. Every month, it's a bit worse. You know, those kind of rules are not put in place in 24h. It's like inflation, it doesn't happen in 24h. But if nothing is done against this madness, in 5 years, we ll have something similar to Nazism, all over the world.<br>
As for camps, those already exist, in Canada ;)</p>

        <p>How can a single person have the audacity to compare a fucking vaccine and Mask mandates, which are used to protect the citizens of this country to the single most evil atrocity committed in human history. You are not aware of the horrors of the holocaust. You didn't have to vistio a KZ(concentration camp) at 14 and look at the fucking ovens where millions of people burned and you didn't have to look at the photos of stacks and stacks of black rods which were once humans like you and me, just going about their lives.</p>

        <p>If this would be like Nazi Germany then every single one of you who disagrees with the government policy would be visited by the very unfriendly people in black uniforms called the Schutzstaffel or short SS and a modern equivalent of that. They wouldn't tell you that you are wrong, they fucking drag you on the street with your entire family and shoot every single one of them right in front of you until you are the last one left and they they's execute you too. That was the shit going on back then. If you are able to say I don't want the vaccine and then you are not forced to take it by any means, then you already have a 1000% different scenario</p>

        <p>I am neither talking about politics nor CEOs I am taking about the German scientists who worked their ass of to create a new kind of vaccine with revolutionary technology. I don't give a shit what the fuck your political opinion is and I don't give a shit if America thkes all the fame for its self once again. I trust my fellow Germans and I trust their knowledge, that gained them their position. If I am the ignorant one then you are the overly scared one who cabt tris something he doesn't fully understand</p>

        <p>If you're trying to turn this into an America vs. Germany thing, don't expect me to defend my country's government.</p>
<p>The United States has a government that doesn't represent the people. It is like a parasite. It uses our labor but doesn't take care of us.</p>
<p>You can tell that by looking at the average American. Bloated, obese, feminized males. Worker bee drone, desexualized females.</p>
<p>Our government doesn't legislate in our interest. It actually works against us at every level in order to exploit workers for the benefit of the ruling class. Politicians aren't "representatives" like they are supposed to be --- they are salesmen whose job it is to sell agendas that serve the capitalists that fund their campaigns.</p>
<p>You know how we ended up this way? By "trusting people that know more than us." Politicians, corporate funded scientists, news media.</p>
<p>So stop with that. The more authority someone has over you -- the more suspicious you should be of their motives.</p>

        <p>Speaking of 80 years... 80 years ago there was a worldwide population boom after the war. This population boom lasted 20-25 years.</p>
<p>That population boom is the primary reason we had more deaths last year. Life expectancy is about \~79, and for that to be an average it means a lot of people die before that.</p>
<p>You can expect the death count to increase for the coming years, so be ready for your side to take advantage of that to manipulate people.</p>
<p>You're on the wrong side of this thing. History will prove this, so instead of digging in further just recognize early that there's time to get out.</p>
<p>Be on the right side of history.</p>

        <p>I am willing to bet that every single one of you are more incompetent in immunology, genetics medicine and just in general in Biology than these scientists who work on the vaccine. Mate why should I be scared I know how the Vaccine works I know what it will do and I know what it won't do. The only thing unkows are possible long term effects but of course cause the vaccine is new like obviously. Also im not even vaccineated yet and already had corona so like what even is your point</p>

        <p>I don't think you are that far off.  I think it's a failure of imagination. You don't have the ability to read the threat that many here see.</p>
<p>In the past, your position might be justified, but what is posited as the new normal represents a deep threat to traditional valuation. It is important for folks to understand why it's a new normal. This proposed shift to a new era is a different type of combat based on the distribution of contradictory information.</p>
<p>It is nearly impossible to navigate this storm with given info. This resistance is wholly predictable.  It's not at all surprising that the vitriol has devolved into a war like situation.</p>
