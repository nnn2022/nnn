    <strong>Weekend Black Friday shopping experience</strong>
    <p><p>On a whim, my dad asked if I’d like to go anywhere. I suggested going to the mall because my initial thought was to buy something for my aunt for Christmas. Candles are something you need to smell so I thought physically going to the store would be better</p>
<p>It wasn’t until we arrived at the mall that we realized what we were getting ourselves into. Shopping a day after Black Friday, and during the pandemic. </p>
<p>We had 3 stores in mind: game stop, bath and body, and hot topic. All stores were followed by a decently sized line. However, Bath and body was the worst one, reaching to the bathroom.. </p>
<p>We decided to keep track of the pace of lines by separating. My dad called and told me hot topic was short, so I sent my little sister to switch places with him while I kept my place for bath and body. The wait time was about 10 mins for hot topic, which isn’t bad. Given the circumstances that it’s Black Friday during a pandemic, yeah it’s reasonable to have an people limit. Yet, there literally shouldn’t be waiting lines for stores. I thought to myself,  “I can’t live like this. If life is gonna be this way from now on, or should it ever reach to this point, I won’t handle it.” </p>
<p>I do respect the rules when going out. I wear a mask in public, at my job. Sanitize. I understand that this is a pandemic and people see this event more differently than I do, so that’s why I abide. (Nor do I wanna be responsible for any sickness either.) But, holy crap. This is not the life I want. This experience may be a preview for what to expect in the future. </p>
<p>I know I probably sound dramatic. We went to the same mall a few times before Black Friday and there were sometimes wait lines at popular stores. So, hopefully this is the last time pandemic shopping would ever be like.  screw this way of living too though</p>
<p>Additional note: If people are scared to stay go and catch a case, why go Black Friday shopping where there’s tons of people in the same place? It’s like all the rules were disregarded for this</p></p>

        <p>Why did you wear the mask?</p>
<p>Look, fuckers. If you don’t start voting with your conscience and your dollar, this crap will only worsen and metastasize. </p>
<p>Quit being little bitches about “following the rules”. </p>
<p>FUCK THESE RULES.</p>
