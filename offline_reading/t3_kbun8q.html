        <p>I... don't think that's true. It was developed faster because of how many different companies and groups developed it, and the budget it had. Put it this way. Let's say you have a 100 sided die, and you want to roll a 100. It's going to be a lot quicker if you buy 50 dice and roll them all at once than buying one and rolling it over and over again.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, just because it was developed quickly does not mean it's any less safe than any other vaccines. It had to go through the exact same safety and test phases as every other vaccine.</p>

<p>That makes as much sense as 9 women coming together and making a baby in a single month. You can't rush long-term testing. It's simply not possible.</p>

        <p>Here is a more concise, easy to understand article.....</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-mask.html">Here's why vaccinated people still need to wear a mask</a></p>
<p>"The new Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna seem to be remarkably good at preventing serious illness. But it’s unclear how well they will curb the spread of the coronavirus. That’s because the Pfizer and Moderna trials tracked only how many vaccinated people became sick with Covid-19. That leaves open the possibility that some vaccinated people get infected without developing symptoms, and could then silently transmit the virus — especially if they come in close contact with others or stop wearing masks. If vaccinated people are silent spreaders of the virus, they may keep it circulating in their communities, putting unvaccinated people at risk."</p>
<p>So the only thing these vaccines have been PROVEN to do is lessen symptoms once you are infected. Not prevent transmission or spread. It is just assumed that if people don't have symptoms (coughing, etc) that they won't spread the virus as easily.</p>

<p>This the very issue that has plagued the response to covid from word go.  ALL reaction should have been to isolate a) the sick, and b) the susceptible.   Instead it has handicapped everyone.</p>

        <p>It's important to remember that some people don't have the resources or autonomy to take care of themselves and isolate themselves. Not everyone can cut themselves off from society. This plan was a compromise between completely isolating the elderly and immunocompromised and shutting down the entire economy. I do agree that COVID could've been handled better, but our knowledge of the virus was very limited when it first came to North America. This was before we even had COVID test kits.</p>

        <p>&rt;It's important to remember that some people don't have the resources or autonomy to take care of themselves and isolate themselves</p>
<p>Strange. I normally get called 'selfish' for pointing that out.</p>
<p>&rt;our knowledge of the virus was very limited when it first came to North America</p>
<p>Don't buy this sad excuse for incompetence. Pandemics are periodic. Our governments had ten years since the last one to get <em>any</em> basic pandemic preparedness in place. They chose not to. Absent conspiracy theories, every single casualty and malefic effect can be traced back to  the human priorities of the corrupt and inefficient, not nature, which in this case can be thwarted with soap and UVC light.</p>
<p>Also, the coronavirus family is well-understood. Several coronaviruses cause the common cold (hence tests also pick up on cold antibodies). SARS and MERS are coronaviruses we've had under surveillance for two decades now, and we have vaccines for them too. Coronaviruses in bats were under lab surveillance when SARS-CoV-2 (the virus: Covid-19 is the disease it causes) emerged.</p>

        <p>It's NOT a compromise, period.  It's a Shut down the economy, it's a nanny state solution.  When we DID learn more about the virus, we continued on the same direction, because every goddman politician is afraid of the flak from the people that fell in behind the mob at the beginning.  They were afraid of admitting they were wrong, because they'd have to admit they destroyed the world's economy for no reason.</p>
<p>If you think not all have the resources and autonomy to take care of themselves, well the 90+% of non-seniors who are there of their own life choices have no one to blame but themselves, the remainder, and the seniors could easily have been taken care of for a small fraction of the economic costs we have put upon ourselves.  Our children will be paying for this debacle for EVER, we are beyond debt that can ever be repaid, it's a permanent thing, that can only be ended by inflation which destroys the poor and makes the rich even richer, or the great reset... or we can just pay the credit card's minimum monthly payment, going deeper and deeper in debt, being able to use less and less of the income we earn each year, until all of our income goes to pay that debt and we have nothing.</p>
<p>The same mentality that was applied to covid, if applied to the criminal justice system, would put everyone in jail, to protect us all from the criminals.  And a healthy person has a greater chance of dying of a criminal act, than they do of dying to covid... So it's a good analogy.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's the cumulative death toll of more than a year. Paired against the nearly 80mil who have caught it it's not a very high number. Why is that something to be afraid over? It's about the same as the death toll of tuberculosis so far this year but you don't see anyone freaking out about that do you? Despite the fact it has significantly less cases = a much higher death rate.</p>
<p>Plus the vaccine seems to be incredibly ineffective. You still have to wear a mask and social distance after you get it because it doesn't prevent the spread. Then what exactly is it good for? </p>
<p>I stand by my statement, a vaccine is not necessary to survive covid, for the most part we've all been doing that just fine without it.</p>

        <p>I don’t consider myself and antivaxer. I’ve had the flu twice in my life and both times it was a year I was talked into getting the flu shot. All the other years I didn’t and never caught the flu. So, that for sure has personally turned me off. </p>
<p>The new vaccine? I’m afraid of it. Seems way too rushed. Now reports of freaky side effects. I have no plans to get it.</p>

        <p>Seeing as how you actually have no clue, in reality, unless you are one of the scientist or someone who had some say in that process or why they made that choice, all you came back with is a fallacy. I find it absurd you can speak to such things like they are facts when  you have no real clue to what’s going on.</p>

        <p>If Vaccines worked they wouldn't want you to wear masks afterwards. If they were safe they'd have been tested. If they worked they wouldn't have to be mandatory. If they saved grandma she wouldn't need me to get a passport when she got vax'd. Do not take the shot, nothing adds up and the few whistleblowers we've heard suggest this could be very dangerous indeed</p>

        <p>Vaccines are never 100% effective. The COVID vaccine is only about 90% effective. They did vigorously test the vaccine, I explained this in an earlier comment.</p>

<li>Read the whole thing man:  However, the research team says that it is important to emphasize that the results of this study should be correctly interpreted. Prof Song said: “The asymptomatic cases identified in the screening programme in Wuhan were truly asymptomatic, as none of them showed clinical symptoms before or during their follow-up isolation. “But there is plenty of evidence elsewhere showing that people infected with Covid-19 may be temporarily asymptomatic and infectious before going on to develop symptoms.</li>
<li>Yes, that is nonsense, and no one believes it. This is not a valid argument against masks.</li>

        <p>Personally I am not interested at all in the vaccine, I will do my best to avoid it at all costs, and hope frieds and family do the same. Why?</p>
<p>My conclusion, when considering the past 9 months, is that the populace is being COERCED into taking a vaccine with never-applied-on-humans-before functionality, which is mRNA. So the problems i see are: Nobody officially has a clue about long-term effects. Every vaccine is not 100% safe. So a rushed one that is meant for billions of humans has the potential to lead to dramatic outcomes.
Why do i say coerced? that is how i feel. lockdowns, social distancing, mask mandates, travel restrictions etc. are not and should not be part of a normal. human life, and were very shitty to experience. If politicians and some scientists say "here is a vaccine, take it, then it will all be over sooner with the measures" that is coercion.</p>
<p>Yes the virus is harming and killing people, absolutely. But my research leads me to the conclusion that nothing about this virus is so special that could rectify all the measures. Viruses kill. Flu kills. Some more. some less. </p>
<p>are you willing to eg "social distance" for the rest of your life just because there now and then are viruses that are slightly more harmful than the flu? Is this still life? Thats up to you to decide. My answer is nope</p>
<p>EDiT: I am vaccinated and ready to take generally any vaccine that had succesful, standard, 8+ years of trial</p>

        <p>Besides the fact that I'm not part of the demographic that dies from the virus... I won't be taking it because it's been rushed through safety measures. And already there have been people that were part of the trials that have developed bell's palsy, what are going to be some of the long term side effects? Not even the companies know, which is why they are covering there ass by not accepting liability to any side effects.</p>

        <p>It may be useful for older people who probably would die of the virus, but for young, healthy people, the side effects of the vaccine could be worse than the virus, so I don't think anybody should be forced (or coerced, by being denied access to certain businesses) into taking it. The side effects are scarier, to me, than the virus, especially since I think I may have had the virus in 2019 and it was like a flu.</p>

        <p>I'm pro-vaccine, dependent upon adequate testing, comprehensive data, and regulatory integrity.</p>
<p>Several vaccines - those based on tried technology using data from past SARS vaccines - satisfy points one and two, even if the third is lacking (the UK's chief medical advisor has shares). One in particular - Moderna - fails on points one, two, <em>and</em> three (the US NIH has a financial stake), so it can shove off.</p>

        <p>I don’t see the point in taking it if your under 70 and somewhat healthy.  Chances of you dying from covid are less than driving to go get the vaccine.  Sounds like some pretty nasty side effects could happen from the vaccine.   I feel the same about flu shots.  Even though the risk is still low that anything would happen to you, I feel it’s still more of a risk than simply having your immune system take care of it.   </p>
<p>If this becomes mandatory for something that’s so survivable- people are going to fight back.  I would have a different opinion if healthy people were dropping in the middle of the street but they’re not.</p>

        <p>I'm hopeful that the mass hypochondria will be over when the vaccine is released and then we'll finally be able to go back to our lives. I won't be getting it though. Why would I bother protecting myself against something that is harmless to me?</p>

        <p>I'm fine with vaccines in general but don't trust this one. I think this whole thing is a fine example of "disaster capitalism" (read Naomi Klein's The Shock Doctrine) in action.</p>
<p>I think that the WHO promoted an overblown and authoritarian response to a mostly survivable virus, in order to create the kind of desperation that would make the whole world buy a rushed, shoddy vaccine, and not just buy it but force people to prove they are vaccinated to go anywhere or do anything. Why? Because the WHO is funded mostly by Bill Gates, and Gates has invested heavily in vaccines and digital id. Look it up yourself, don't take my word for it.</p>
