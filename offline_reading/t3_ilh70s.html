    <strong>I hate this so fucking much</strong>
    <p><p>Gyms finally opened up in my city and I’ve been anxiously waiting for today. Go to my gym, wearing a mask (which sucks to workout in by the way). Feeling good for my deadlifts, record my heaviest set. Hit a number I haven’t hit since before lockdown so I’m hyped. Upload the video.</p>
<p>Almost immediately I have people messaging me to fix my mask and that I’m the reason we’ll get a second wave.</p>
<p>Hey...kindly fuck off. So much new information has come out that asymptomatic carriers are not super spreaders and my mask was just below my nose. I’m not fixing it after it slides off after I’m set up for a heavy deadlift. That’ll just throw me out of my groove. Plus with the surgical ones, it kept slipping every 5 seconds the sweatier I got and I need to intake some fresh air after a heavy lift. </p>
<p>These fucking doomers are going to be the death of me I swear.</p></p>

        <p>"So much new information has come out that asymptomatic carriers are not super spreaders" I can understand the confusion of the WHO statement as it is a very niche terminology difference. Asymptomatic means you have a disease but do not develope symptoms. On the other hand, Presymsomatic means that you are yet to develop symptoms but will in the future. The also media tends to lump these two together which leads to even more confusion</p>

        <p>Presymptiomatic means you DO have symptoms, they are just so mild that they aren’t significant enough to be considered a symptom. It’s the point where you start to feel sick — a tickle in the throat, increasing fatigue, etc. someone going to the gym generally feels perfectly fine and is therefore asymptomatic or doesn’t even have it.</p>

        <p>Is it basic decency to strip people of their ability to communicate with others? Is it basic decency to treat every human as a potential biohazard, as a walking talking disease spreader? To see other humans as lepers? Is it basic decency to shame others for not complying (or for not being able to comply for medical or disability reasons)? Is it basic decency to refuse service to someone who medically cannot wear a mask? Is it basic decency to shut off society and interaction with society for people who are deaf or have other hearing issues and rely on lip reading to understand people? </p>
<p>I don’t know man, seems kind of indecent if you ask me, especially considering that a) data on mask compliance show that it literally makes zero difference on outcomes (see California with high compliance and high infection rate versus Arizona with low compliance and an extremely low infection rate), b) this virus has a fatality rate of 0.6-0.3%, and that rate goes down to basically zero under the age of 50, and c) respiratory viruses will spread no matter what you do since transmission is predicated on breathing. So if you’re alive, it will spread. You can’t prevent it much beyond basic hygiene practices. A better strategy is allowing it to spread amongst the healthy active population during the summer months when people are generally more active and healthier, which would have protected vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>But anyway.</p>

        <p>First off, 7,000 people in America die a day. And the average age of people who die from this is like 80-something. I’m not denying the severity of the disease, but it’s really not as bad as it was made out to be.</p>
<p>Also, if we’re talking numbers here, MILLIONS of people will die this year from starvation, suicide, economic devastation and lack of care due to an over-focus on covid. So infinitely more people are going to die from lockdowns and our fear of this disease. Do you really care about mitigating life lost?</p>
<p>Really don’t give me the whole “how many 9/11s?” That’s a bullshit argument right there. Thousands were murdered, whereas this is a disease like any other respiratory disease that kills .6% of people over time as it infects people.</p>

        <p>&rt; Is it basic decency to strip people of their ability to communicate with others?</p>
<p>How? We’ve been wearing masks at my job at a lumber yard and have had no issues at all with communicating while wearing a mask. </p>
<p>&rt; Is it basic decency to treat every human as a potential biohazard, as a walking talking disease spreader?</p>
<p>Yes. If you have a compromised immune system any interaction could be lethal, especially under these conditions. </p>
<p>We’re just trying to look out for the weakest among us. </p>
<p>&rt; To see other humans as lepers?</p>
<p>Well if anyone could be carrying a disease that’s potentially lethal or could cause long term debilitation, yeah it seems sensible to look at everyone as potentially carrying said disease. </p>
<p>&rt; Is it basic decency to refuse service to someone who medically cannot wear a mask?</p>
<p>Who are these people? If you have such breathing difficulty that spending a small amount of time wearing a mask is actually dangerous for then you are likely at very high risk of death if you catch covid. And there’s numerous services to meet your needs without actually going into a store. </p>
<p>It’s decency to look out for the health of everyone who ensures the store and not making exceptions for individual comfort.</p>
<p>&rt; Is it basic decency to shut off society and interaction with society for people who are deaf or have other hearing issues and rely on lip reading to understand people?</p>
<p>Lip reading is only helpful to people  with partial hearing. It’s by no means exact.  Many deaf people are accustomed to writing things down to communicate with people who can’t use sign language. There’s actually a LOT of deaf people in my area. </p>
<p>In fact one of my co-workers is significantly hearing impaired, we just stand a little further away and take our masks off to speak to him. It’s not difficult at all. </p>
<p>&rt; data on mask compliance show that it literally makes zero difference on outcomes </p>
<p><em>citation needed</em></p>
<p>&rt; California with high compliance and high infection rate versus Arizona with low compliance and an extremely low infection rate</p>
<p>How many variables do you think could be at play with this comparison? I can think of quite a few right away, but suffice it to say this is not a well made point. </p>
<p>&rt; this virus has a fatality rate of 0.6-0.3%, and that rate goes down to basically zero under the age of 50,</p>
<p>And yet it still kills people and even many survivors suffer severe lung impairment. Are you saying we should just ignore those people’s health and happiness for your convenience?</p>
<p>&rt;  respiratory viruses will spread no matter what you do since transmission is predicated on breathing.</p>
<p>That is unless we take steps to slow down the spread...oh wait. </p>
<p>&rt; A better strategy is allowing it to spread amongst the healthy active population during the summer months when people are generally more active and healthier, which would have protected vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>A virus with no known controls, which can’t be treated, which could easily mutate at any time to become more severe, that isn’t thoroughly understood yet... and you think the <em>best</em> solution is just give it to everyone and see what happens?</p>
<p>But anyway indeed. </p>
<p>I feel like all of this can be summed up with <em>”But what about ME?!?”</em></p>

        <p>Just because it doesn’t affect YOU doesn’t mean it doesn’t affect others. I guess you don’t actually care about how things affect other people?</p>
<p>You’re acting as if this is a disease that is super lethal and guaranteed to give you problems. Have you had it? Do you know people who have had it? I had it, as did most of my friends and family. Anecdotally? It’s a disease that is worse the older you get, regardless of whether you have a compromised immune system of not (because again, it’s still not that lethal unless you are really obese or really old). No one I know personally has died (but I have heard of people who have) and everyone is completely healthy months later. The “permanent damage” people spout is having symptoms that last more than a month, which has happened to more than a few people. But that was back in April and now all those people are healthier than they have ever been before. </p>
<p>I hate it when people say “but it’s novel! We don’t know what this virus will do!” We actually know a lot, not only because it acts like every other respiratory virus, but also because it’s extremely well-studied. This virus isn’t mutating into something worse, we know who is most vulnerable (the elderly), young people don’t die from this, and mitigating spread makes it an  issue for longer, which would be fine if the economy didn’t matter, but because we have actual data that a bad economy kills people, that starvation and suicide and poor disease treatment will kill millions, the longer you keep up this idiocy, the more people will die from the very mitigation policies that is trying to save people. </p>
<p>And also, locking down everyone and everything doesn’t save the vulnerable — it actually makes them even more vulnerable because you aren’t surrounding them with young and healthy people who are immune. So a policy that doesn’t allow for young people to spread it amongst themselves and then allow the recovered people to be a literal wall of protection to the elderly and immune compromised literally MURDERS those people. So yeah, based on what we know, the logical non-fear-based thing to do would be allowing it to spread amongst the young and healthy who have a natural propensity to party and breathe in each other’s faces. But my apologies for thinking our society has moved past puritanical morality shaming towards people who dare to want to have fun “in a pandemic!” Even though that would actually save the people you claim to care about.</p>
<p>And going back to people who medically can’t wear masks — it’s been proven, over and over again, that having asthma or other breathing problems isn’t a significant comorbidity in terms of dying or being hospitalized for covid. Obesity and age is the major factors. So no, being someone who has difficulty breathing doesn’t put them more at risk. And there are also people who have PTSD from being choked, or autistic people who can’t handle something on their face because they have extreme sensory issues, or people with anxiety disorders who will literally stop breathing from an anxiety attack if they feel a lack of oxygen due to mask wearing. So maybe you should try to be a little more empathetic and step outside yourself to understand that universal mask mandates are probably a little more than discriminatory.</p>
<p>Also, do you truly believe that a person who has gotten it should be forced to wear a mask? Because if someone is immune, why the hell should they be forced to wear something that is completely unnecessary?</p>

        <p>&rt; I guess you don’t actually care about how things affect other people?</p>
<p>Like whether or not you expose people to a potentially lethal or crippling disease?</p>
<p>&rt; You’re acting as if this is a disease that is super lethal and guaranteed to give you problems.</p>
<p>Quote me. </p>
<p>&rt; But that was back in April and now all those people are healthier than they have ever been before.</p>
<p><em>citation needed</em></p>
<p>&rt; the longer you keep up this idiocy, the more people will die from the very mitigation policies that is trying to save people.</p>
<p>Wearing masks and keeping some distance is ruining the economy? That’s fascinating. </p>
<p>Some groups are even making phenomenal profits in this time. </p>
<p>&rt; So maybe you should try to be a little more empathetic</p>
<p>Like following the very basic policies to reduce the spread of an infectious disease? </p>
<p>There’s loads of curbside pickup, plenty of delivery options. There’s plenty of ways for these people to have their needs met.  </p>
<p>What about all the people who are stricken with anxiety over their potential for infection? What about people who are at high risk?</p>
<p>“It’s only the very old and sick” okay, so what about them? </p>
<p>&rt; Also, do you truly believe that a person who has gotten it should be forced to wear a mask? Because if someone is immune, why the hell should they be forced to wear something that is completely unnecessary?</p>
<p>Although there are people who have possibly experienced reinfection, immunity may likely not be permanent and that direct guarantee an inability to spread. </p>
<p>If nothing else other people around you can’t know that you’re immune. To allay those concerns and to even shower basic solidarity it’s a smart move so people in general may feel more comfortable.</p>

        <p>On the plus side... the amount of people now so empowered about treating people 'properly' is great.</p>
<p>Perhaps we'll see a big push for wider accessibility for people who can't walk, who can't hear, who have restricted diets etc.</p>
<p>Everyone's getting furious about having to live their lives like these people for a short amount of time that it's going to be great to see that energy go forward to other causes.</p>
<p>I say this because no one ever says "I feel shitty because I was impacted personally" but they attack the principle itself. </p>
<p>So that's awesome!</p>
