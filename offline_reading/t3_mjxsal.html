    <strong>I Am 21 Weeks Pregnant And Can Take Sixteen Doctors, Nurses Or Politicians From Edinburgh To London Once A Week But You Can't See Your Family Across The Road</strong>
    <p><p>So I am a coach driver and when everyone was told to stay away from family or isolated from basic social interactions, we drivers are still going from Edinburgh to London every week taking the people in the title all over the country. Very rare for people to wear a mask for the entire sixteen-hour journey and recently I had drunk doctors on my bus who I had to remove for spiking a temperature on the coach and bragging about a party down south. (I could be fired for transporting people with potential COVID symptoms). He isn't the only person who has told me this happens on the bus. Now I am all for returning to normality and have never followed the mask mandates or social restrictions but these people are supposed to be the face of this bullshit and complained when I took off my face shield to drive and breathalyze.</p>
<p>Remember kids, You are a grandmother killer for not wearing a mask that doesn't work or want to see your family but medical professions and whatever else can party and go maskless and are heros.</p></p>
