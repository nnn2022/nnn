        <p>Why would I publish a book if I didn't judge the book as worthy of five stars? No, I'd just edit a 4 star book until I think it's worth a 5 star review, stupid. Do you even think before you type or just type whatever shit you think sounds clever while basking in your own farts? Plus I'm sooo sorry I don't have the a giant publishing company or a trust fund to blow 10k on a facebook ad campaign to sell my books. I let treasure find those who deserve it. I'm not going to chase after swine tossing pearls. "Trumptards" yeah, bet that word rolls right off the tongue with the complete 90 day disaster you voted into office. A walking apocalypse who already had 9% inflation forcasted, some of the worst press of any president in history, no respect of foreign leaders, and I could go on but your potato brain of a president is a fucking joke and many, many democrats are having buyer's remorse they didn't vote for Trump. I laugh at the ruin you've all caused and can't wait for 2022 and 2024 to be a huge death knell to the DNC and establishment GOP.</p>

        <p>I just went through this gallery.  It's clear you don't play magic the gathering from how terribly formatted each of those cards are, none of them for the flavour of the colours on the card, you're using weird ass ways to word stuff.  You keep referring to "rounds" but there aren't any rounds in MTG.  The cards above are an absolute joke, as if anyone would be able to understand what they do (if they did anything). </p>
<p>Like you just wrote "Scry 3" on a creature.  But when do you Scry 3 with that creature?  When the etb?  When they ltb?  When they attack?  Block? Is it a tap ability?</p>

        <p>That's what I mean! </p>
<p>Brainwashed politics aside, I've been workin on a custom set that almost has this many cards. How can you work so hard on something that can't even be played? Cause your right a lot of these barely function within MTG.</p>
<p>Like if it was a few joke political cards, sure w/e. But OP do you try and play with these? Or is it all a bit? Obviously you like Magic, but are the poor card mechanics part of the joke?</p>

        <p>The function perfectly fine in MTG with the current power creep. My art project has thousands of fans and people who keep up with it, even some who download and print my custom cards. They are also highly informative and normies even pass them around to inform of them shit they don't know in the fake news. It also lampoons and ridicules nonsense like sex mutants who are trying to corrupt our society. BTW, I'm an openly gay man and a person of color, so I was fighting for gay and civil rights in the 80s. I have a greater perspective on these issues than 99% of americans especially being someone who's helped dozens of sexmutants detransition to live normal lives and love their natural bodies and gendersex they were born as. :D The mechanics aren't poor. They are highly clever and far better  than what the feminazis who don't have 100 creative work hours between the lot of them have designed in the last decade or so. MTG has been trash for years and being infiltrated by Portlandia losers didn't help. I play Arena cause it's free, I wouldn't pay for physical cards because they are shit quality and have been for the greater part of the last 10-15 years and I've played since magic the gathering ANTIQUITIES, kiddo. You're seriously harping on my mechanics when trash like Ikoria, Amonket, Journey into Nyx, Throne of Eldraine were whole blocks full of bullshit? ROFL, you must be kidding.</p>

<p>Honestly thats inspiring, cause these are awful cards. This makes me feel so much better about my designs and hell even my formating.</p>
<p>Flavor texts are all <em>italicized</em> and shouldn't be partially covered by the power and toughness box lol. <em>This is true even for very old of magic sets.</em></p>
<p>Also why do none of the actiavted abilities have commas? Costs should be separateed like this "R, Tap: Activated Ability." <em>This is true even for very old of magic sets.</em></p>
<p>I hope your a dedicated troll, cause if you honestly think these are good cards... yikes. This is what I expect from children.</p>

        <p>They aren't always italicized, only direct quotes are. And it really doesn't matter anyways. And you don't need a thousand commas, mom. :D Also, it's more about the spirit of the message anyways, idiot. These aren't meant to be played with although you clearly could. Your entire diatribe boiled down to a couple missing commas and 'oh no, your quotes are touching the numbers' ROFL. You're a fucking clown who splits hairs to feel superior. What a hollow victory, kiddo. You literally are bitching about some super minor formating issues, ones that are rather redundant and that I've streamlined past.</p>

        <p>There are rounds and turns, stupid. Your individual turn is a turn. Your round is when both players have taken a turn, you absolute dumbshit. "Terribly formatted" because you lack comprehension of what my colors, races, worlds, and contexts mean in my setting. Did you notice the lack of planeswalkers, for example? No, you clearly didn't. That's just scratching the surface, peon. You're clearly a TDS suffering idiot with a hardon for hate. Go wax your epeen and create something of your own that doesn't suck. I doubt you can.

        <p>As a magic player who regularly makes custom cards.. these are all hard to read, and they aren't in flavour for the colours of mana you chose, there's too much going on.  Annnnd actually that's about it</p>

        <p>And then you clearly don't know the paradigm of my world. White is for white people. Black is for black people. Red tends to be latino or native american. Green tends to be Indian or Middle Eastern, and Blue tends to be Asian or Islander or Inuit. Aquapussy is for mutant merfolk, all late night hosts have a normal form and a true form that's an alien vampire black/white mix, etc. And yes, most of the keyword abilities are faithful to the MTG colors, I pay very close attention to my designs, not as much in SET A as those are recreations of protest art but from set B (mostly) and especially C onwards I have a very specific set of races, keywords, creature families, legendaries, and such that follow a specific pattern - one you're clearly not insightful enough to glean, kiddo. I'm also a professional game designer, this is just a fun side project for me.</p>

<p>Oh god you have no idea how magic works... Like none at all.  With Ted Cruz how the fuck do you put a token creature back into someone's hand?  Or exile a counter on a creature?  That makes no sense, none at all.  Not to mention you completely fucked up all the flavour text.  </p>
<p>Then again you're an anti-masker and anti-vax so your brain has probably rotted away enough for these to make sense to you.</p>

        <p>Your Trump Derangement Syndrome is showing. Thanks for playing, you're brain clearly has more than 10 poison counters rattling around up there. Also, the cards are clearly a spoof based on the absurd power creep meta of the last 6-9 sets, you absolute moron. And yes, it does make sense with Ted Cruz.. why? BORDER BOSS. He sends illegals back to their country (putting back into your hand). He removes contraband from illegals (exiling counters on a creature). Are you really so dumb you didn't rub your brain cells together for two seconds? Maybe get a little creative? OH RIGHT, YOU'RE A LEFTIST LUNATIC which is why all you have is NPC thinking and 'in the box' sheep mentality. Don't you have some unvaccincated people to go yell at, Karen?</p>

        <p>It's funny to watch people make valid criticism, then see OP just stream of consciousness scream and whine about it.</p>

        <p>"Valid criticism" =/= "I don't know why X creature has X ability (Ted Cruz), but I haven't taken time to think about it. I am gonna take that time to go bitch about it rather than ruminate for a moment because thinking is too hard'. It's also hilarious you completely ignore how politically bias this moron who's attacking me is because he got triggered by my cards so much he had to go share it on magic reddit and got blocked for it.</p>
