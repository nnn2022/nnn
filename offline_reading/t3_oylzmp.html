    <strong>It's almost as I live in another reality than most people on internet</strong>
    <p><p>I've always try to be skeptical about crazy conspiracy theories and I may sound ignorant but how the fuck are we supposedly having +600 daily deaths in Mexico?</p>
<p>I swear, In almost 2 years of this pandemic I have known of like 3 death people because of Covid, no one close to me</p>
<p>I take the bus everyday (which is packed), I go to work, I hang out with friends, family (who did not isolate ever) and I play with my band in bars, still, I haven't seen this pandemic as it sounds in the news, media, etc...</p>
<p>And this is coming from someone who at the beginning was super strict about isolation, mask, and even got mad at my family who did not isolate.</p>
<p>This is utterly BS. Not the virus, which is real, but the "pandemic"</p></p>

        <p>You've known 3 people who have died from this virus?  That's 3 more than I know.</p>
<p>I barely know anyone who has even had it, and of those nothing serious.  Just staying at home, resting for a few days, full recovery.</p>
<p>If we didn't have the Media or social media, we probably wouldn't even know this "pandemic" exists.</p>

        <p>I don’t know anyone who has died from it.</p>
<p>I had a coworker who said her cousin did (last year) and my partner said a guy he went to high school with who was on the local news (also last year) did. And it was probably because they were put on ventilators when they shouldn’t have been.</p>
<p>So that’s 2 people I’ve even heard of, and I don’t actually know either of them. I sadly know way more people who have died of suicide and overdoses than covid.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind, it's only infecting about 2% of the population. And 0.19% of the US population has died from it.</p>
<p>Also, 40% of those deaths (in US) were in nursing homes. Unfortunately, typically, people in nursing homes aren't widely known by a lot of people outside. So it's just less people that have a "friend of a friend" type connection.</p>
<p>Knowing someone who died from COVID is as uncommon as knowing someone who has six fingers on one hand.</p>
<p>The deaths and numbers seem large but in context of the population, not so much.</p>
