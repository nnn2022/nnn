    <strong>To all people saying unvaccinated people shouldn't receive healthcare.</strong>
    <p><p>There has been a steady rise in people saying that hospitals shouldn't help unvaccinated people and they should be left to die. For the majority of healthy adults the chance to die off COVID-19 is extremely low. (see for yourself at <a href="https://qcovid.org/">https://qcovid.org/</a>)<br>
Nevertheless,  Would you also refuse hospital care to someone who:</p>
<p>- Eats fast food for years on end.<br>
- Engages in extreme sports.<br>
- Runs a red light.<br>
- Smokes.<br>
- Speeds.<br>
- Takes recreational drugs.<br>
- Drinks (excessively).<br>
- Is an (professional) athlete.<br>
- Does not exercise at all.<br>
- Is a criminal.<br>
- Is active in the army.<br>
- Has a desk job and sits 10 hours a day.<br>
- Works with hazardous materials.<br>
- Has a physically demanding job in construction or manufacturing.  </p>
<p>Like taking/refusing a vaccine these are all choices that increase your risk of ending up in the hospital. Yet, these choices were <strong>NEVER</strong> up for debate. Respect our choice to <strong>NOT</strong> take this vaccine, I can't stress enough that it's about <strong>THIS</strong> vaccine and not every vaccine ever manufactured.   </p>
<p>We respect your choice to take it and be treated if you do experience side effects. Respect is a two way street. Don't let fear cloud your mind.</p></p>
