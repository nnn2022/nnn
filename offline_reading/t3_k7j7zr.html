        <p>Why aren’t people getting healthy? We’ve had 9 months to get cholesterol and weight in check. An estimated 300,000 deaths per year are due to the obesity epidemic, where’s the outrage at the amount of beds they’re taking up? They could probably fit more beds if they didnt have to be made wide enough for obese people.</p>

        <p>Every local Facebook page, ever reddit page. The automatic response from many seems to always be "I know 3, 6, 20! people that have the cooties. They're all having trouble breathing and have long term problems. 5 have died! Every life is precious. You'll change your tune when it's someone YOU care about." Etc. We've all seen it.</p>
<p>And quite frankly. I call bullshit. Are these things bots or something? And yes at this point even if they are real people, they are things. Mindless, brain dead <em>things</em>. Not humans. The walking brain dead.</p>
<p>Because look. Family friend has a husband that works in a hospital that serves the desert communities who's a nurse. Palm Desert/Palm Springs/Cathedral City area. She has relayed that according to him, they're not low on ICU beds, there's not excess people in the hospital over this thing, there's no overworked staff that can't keep up. My brother does that worthless distance zoom meeting learning thing crap for his community college. Our local one has a lot of nursing school people in it that work, temps in the local hospitals. Across 6 different ones here in the IE. A lot of these students bleed over into other classes like I once took and that my brother takes now. According to him, during these classes it's come up and all of them say the same damn thing. No lack of ICU beds, no overflow of cooties patients, no overworked near collapsing nursing staff. Nothing. And in all cases are asking 'WTF is the media and politicians talking about?" when they're coming up with this crap. It's lies. We have a family friend that works in hospital supplies. Even she has said that while the people she deals with are freaked out, there's not any lack of ppe, beds, supplies. No overrun hospitals, etc. She fulfills orders for these people throughout the region. If any of this were true she would have orders out the ass coming in. Nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Just WTF!?</p>
<p>I know my comment here is as provable as the ones to the contrary. But this is what I've heard. And empty hospital parking I've seen myself at the start of this and again now. This is the greatest hoax and mass hysteria event ever. Ever. To what end I have no idea.</p>
<p>And for the record. Yes, the cooties is real. But it's just another flu. That's it.</p>

        <p>Really depends on the state too. I’m in Michigan and numbers rose, hospitals are “full” but we have 2 convention centers setup and emergency hospitals for 9 months and 14 people uses them, we haven’t touched them since.  So yea, I think hospitals are “more full” but if we were out of beds we would be utilizing emergency hospitals. Even nyc at its worst barely used that medical ship that docked there. I believe the hospitals at the convention centers were a way to keep the centers open by paying them under the “ we may need you”</p>

        <p>Make sure you really understand what ICU capacity drop means. In a lot of hospitals they set aside 20 beds out of 200 just for Covid. When 15 people are in those beds they come screaming about capacity. When in reality there are plenty of beds they could make available easily.</p>
