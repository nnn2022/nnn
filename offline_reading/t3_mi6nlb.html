<title>The UK was promised pre-pandemic normality from June 21st, a vaccine passport is still a restriction. A goalpost shifted. If pre-pandemic normal could be described as a beautiful-looking Bentley motor, post-pandemic freedom looks like an old Ford Fiesta pass-me-down from your COVID riddled father.</title>

    <p><p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9428665/Covid-passport-trials-begin-Boris-Johnson-set-unveil-test-scheme-venues-Monday.html">The Certificate of Vaccination ID</a> or COVID sets a dangerous precedent for the future. Nobody seems to be asking the right questions because they're so stuck in the COVID matrix people will keep biting at that dangling carrot in a false sense of a return to normality.</p>
<p>The main questions are how long will these passports be around? And could they eventually evolve into something more sinister? Please, we need to start questioning the bigger picture here.</p>
<p>The UK was promised pre-pandemic normality from June 21st, a <strong>vaccine passport is still a restriction</strong>. Another goalpost shifted. If pre-pandemic normal could be described as a beautiful-looking Bentley motor, the post-pandemic new normal looks like an old Ford Fiesta pass-me-down from your COVID riddled father.</p></p>

        <p>Once in, not only will they never go away, there will be endless scope creep as to how they are used:</p>
<p>"In sorry sir, you can't buy that pizza, as you have exceeded your recommended calorie allowance for the day"</p>
<p>"as a consequence of your decision to not attend unconscious bias training, you can only purchase 10 litres of diesel this month"</p>
<p>Hence why a lot of effort has gone into ensuring this won't be debated before introduction.</p>

        <p>I'm getting increasingly worried now that they're going to become a thing. I think it's your civic duty to not take the vaccine - and so long as that ends up being a significant proportion of the populous, then they will reach a limit with what they can stop people from doing.</p>
<p>If the survival rate is as ridiculously high as it is, there is literally no incentive whatsoever for the young and fit to take it. So they've go to strong arm you into taking it - so that you become the government's bitch and will do whatever they've got planned next as well. Cashless society, ID cards, facial recognition roll-out...</p>
