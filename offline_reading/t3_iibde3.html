    <strong>If you want a (potential) vision of the future, add Utopia 58 to your quarantine reading list.</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52536862-utopia-58">Utopia 58</a> is a 1984-esque dystopian novel wherein everyone has to wear a mask- in addition to a white hood and voice modulator- to “promote equality”. Gender, race, age, color, and even names are banned. And anyone who dares to show individuality is punished, by death or otherwise. It’s basically <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giver">The Giver</a> on steroids. And it sounds scarily like the kind of world these SJW Covid-Karens want- everyone wearing masks and forcibly made “equal”.</p></p>

        <p>Have you ever read Harrison Bergeron? </p>
<p>In the year 2081, the 211th, 212th, and 213th amendments to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution">Constitution</a> dictate that all Americans are fully equal and not allowed to be smarter, better-looking, or more physically able than anyone else. The Handicapper General's agents enforce the equality laws, forcing citizens to wear "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicapping">handicaps</a>": masks for those who are too beautiful, loud radios that disrupt thoughts inside the ears of intelligent people, and heavy weights for the strong or athletic.</p>
<p>One April, 14-year-old Harrison Bergeron, an intelligent, athletic, and good-looking teenager, is taken away from his parents, George and Hazel Bergeron, by the government. They are barely aware of the tragedy, as Hazel has "average" intelligence (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism">euphemism</a> for stupidity), and George has a handicap radio installed by the government to regulate his above-average intelligence.</p>
<p>Hazel and George watch ballet on television. They comment on the dancers, who are weighed down to counteract their gracefulness and masked to hide their attractiveness. George's thoughts are continually interrupted by the different noises emitted by his handicap radio, which piques Hazel's curiosity and imagination regarding handicaps. Noticing his exhaustion, Hazel urges George to lie down and rest his "handicap bag", 47 pounds (21 kg) of weights locked around George's neck. She suggests taking a few of the weights out of the bag, but George resists, aware of the illegality of such an action.</p>
<p>On television, a news reporter struggles to read the bulletin and hands it to the ballerina wearing the most grotesque mask and heaviest weights. She begins reading in her unacceptably natural, beautiful voice, then apologizes before switching to a more unpleasant voice. Harrison's escape from prison is announced, and a full-body photograph of Harrison is shown, indicating that he is seven feet (2.1 m) tall and burdened by three hundred pounds (140 kg) of handicaps.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. To me this is the biggest argument against them. Masks rob us of our public identity. Maybe that’s why so many people on the internet seem to love them. They can stay incognito even when venturing out of their homes.</p>

        <p>Description makes me think of Ayn Rand's "Anthem". But at this point, who needs novelized fiction when the IRL state of affairs is as dystopian as it is?</p>
