    <strong>where do these numbers come from?</strong>
    <p><p>Im honestly asking this question in a non-facetious. The one reason i 100% this pandemic is bullshit because i question how they are getting the Daily case number from. It was "reported" that there were 25-28000 cases in the US, and i must ask myself these 2 questions</p>
<ol>
<li>What is happening where people are getting tested for Covid this often</li>
<li>These places that are doing the tests are reporting these cases nonstop? </li>
</ol>
<p>The thought that comes to mind is that considering they are reporting 26k cases a day, they are saying that every second 3 people are getting covid. So there are two conclusions i come up with</p>
<ol>
<li>Their the tests are bullshit and they are flawed</li>
<li>their pulling the numbers out of their asses</li>
</ol>
<p>Same goes with deaths, which im way less friendly with because im just come to the conclusion that the majority of the covid deaths are actually from covid itself, but the person who died at the time was either near someone with covid, or they had  covid at the time.</p></p>

        <p>What they are now calling "cases" are reported positive test results. </p>
<p>Those numbers are aggregate.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>I testing lab processes 30,000 patient samples in a 24 hour period. </p>
<p>Of those, 300 are positive (1%)</p>
<p>That number is reported to the respective states health department. </p>
<p>State documents 300 "cases". </p>
<p>Rinse and repeat for every processing laboratory in the country.</p>
