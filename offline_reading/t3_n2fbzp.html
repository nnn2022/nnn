        <p>Some people, probably more than you think, actually enjoy wearing a mask because they are insecure about their appearance. </p>
<p>This was already a thing in some Asian countries were mask wearing was already common.</p>
<p><a href="https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/more-japanese-youth-wearing-surgical-masks-to-hide-their-face">https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/more-japanese-youth-wearing-surgical-masks-to-hide-their-face</a></p>
<p>&rt;As I thought about it some more, I began to realise that my new  sense of freedom was also connected in some ways to being a woman.  Having always been self-conscious about my looks, I like the fact I can  now go about my business without being judged on my appearance by others  – male or female. A bit like wearing a school uniform, I suppose,  suddenly we are all starting from the same place. Wearing a face mask  is, as it turns out, a great leveller.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/women-face-masks-coronavirus-appearance-shopping-a9634506.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/women-face-masks-coronavirus-appearance-shopping-a9634506.html</a></p>
<p>&rt;Then there are those who wear masks because they’re self-conscious  about the way they look or have something they want to hide, like a  pimple or even their emotions.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In particular, wearing surgical masks for cosmetic and comfort  purposes has become so popular among young people in Japan over the past  few years that the media has begun labeling it as a “fashion trend.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; ZIP! also surveyed the reasons why people who aren’t sick or have  allergies wear masks. The results, beginning with the most popular  answer, are as follows:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;They’re not wearing any makeup and want to hide their face<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;To keep their face warm<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;To make their face look small<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It comforts them<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;To keep their throat from drying while sleeping</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/style/face-masks-women.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/style/face-masks-women.html</a></p>
<p>&rt; But if there were one tiny, very tiny, silver lining to the reality that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/which-stores-require-masks.html">masks</a> are a necessary component of our daily lives now, it is this: smiling on our own terms.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“For the first time ever, the weather getting nicer is *not* correlating with more men demanding that I smile, so that’s something. Thanks face mask!” Steph Herold, an activist and researcher in Queens, <a href="https://twitter.com/StephHerold/status/1262528610033897473">tweeted</a> recently.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“Not having to fake smile or apologize for coming off a certain way has been such a weight off my shoulders,” said Talia Cuddeback, a recruiter in Austin, Texas.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“Wearing a mask is so liberating I might hang on to it, even if they do find a Covid-19 cure,” said Clare Mackintosh, an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/After-End-Clare-Mackintosh/dp/0451490576/">author</a> who lives in Wales. “I walked past a building site the other day, and despite my resting bitch face, no one yelled at me to ‘smile, love.’ No random men in the supermarket have suggested I ‘cheer up, it might never happen,’ and not a single person has suggested I’d look prettier with a grin on my face.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In the midst of a pandemic that has brought to light so many of the festering inequities brewing just underneath the surface — and as racial injustice takes rightful center stage in American activism — feminine facial freedom is a minor victory. But it is also not nothing.</p>
