        <p>It's amazing who the cultists consider experts. </p>
<p>So Bill Gates is a an expert on vaccines and public health, but actual virologists are not.</p>
<p>WTF? Are we living in a comic book?  Gates does look like the stereotypical comic book evil genius supervillain...ü§î</p>

        <p>The problem with "experts", regardless of credentials, is that their opinions tend to discounted if their conclusions don't match the narrative. </p>
<p>The record is replete with examples whether we go all the way back to AIDS (Peter Dusberg comes to mind), climate change or this.</p>
<p>Now, like then, there is a stranglehold on information. Then, there simply was no viable way to convey the information, now is blocked or ignored by media.</p>
<p>Currently, science is a weapon.</p>

        <p>I saw the talk on bill gates where he said this.
OP is taking his statement massively out of context, i would call it fake news.</p>
<p>Yes he said population can decrease with vaccines to 10%-15%.</p>
<p><strong><em>But do you know why</em></strong></p>
<p>People will make less children if their quality of life is better. There is a whole story behind OP doesnt bother to tell.</p>
<p>Before you downvote me, i agree with y'all, but c'mon spit out some real info.</p>
<p>Maybe those 17 yo teen moms here could learn from it, like OP probably is too</p>

        <p>If you want to end the current lockdown situation you are far better doing it with logic, reason and facts that show the errors and problems with lockdown rather than propegating conspiratorial nonsense.</p>
<p>Every time a meme like this is posted the cause to get back to normality is harmed and the pro-lockdown crowd get stronger.</p>

        <p>Plot twist: he was thinking of the idiots who will refuse to be vaccinated and will be simply left to die as they signed their own "do not resuscitate" order together with signing they don't want to be vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Almost like preventing preventable diseases in children reduces mortality rate! So instead of having 5 kids hoping 1-2 survives you can have 1 kid knowing they won't die! Therefore it reduces population growth resulting in a lower overall population. 
But yeah, a vaccine that prevents your kid from dying or becoming crippled (polio) shouldn't be taken when you can just have 6 kids knowing that about half are going to end up dead before 10</p>

        <p>Where is empowering women with education and BIRTH CONTROL in this equation? Give me a freaking break. </p>
<p>Women don‚Äôt have 5 kids to hedge their bets. They have 5 kids because they don‚Äôt have ownership over their own bodies and they don‚Äôt have access to THEIR OWN birth control. Not talking about making their husbands and partners wear condoms - talking about birth control the woman is in charge of.</p>

        <p>Now a days that is the case, I'm talking about when child mortality rate was close to 50%. You know, 1600s-1700s. Multiple cases/studies where introduction of contraceptives and proper education reduces teenage pregnancy and unwanted births (where someone is clearly not ready to have a kid or doesn't want one), it is a necessity in any civilized society. Proper education and resources are important. 
But there is a reason why before modern medicine you had families with 5 plus children, because it was the best way to ensure that at least some of you're kids survived. Now, it is much more common to see families with only 1-2 kids because there is an extremely low chance of your kids dying.
If you don't want to have a child then you shouldn't. 
The guy has no say in whether or not a woman should, will or is ready to have a kid, that's her choice no one else's. Same line as saying all guys should have a vasectomy. Your body, your right 
My main argument is that vaccines work, if you don't want to line up for the covid vaccine that's fine, it is a situation where it is extremely rushed and may very well have side effects. To say that the polio vaccine causes polio is insane.</p>

        <p>Wtf Bill Gates wasn‚Äôt alive in the 1600-1700s. So why would he be touting vaccines as the solution to population control when birth control (and educating women - I don‚Äôt mean educating them about their uteruses, I mean giving them meaningful access to education, which by the way MILLIONS of girls have now lost bc precious covid lockdowns) is the first line of defense against that? </p>
<p>So I don‚Äôt understand your comment and if Bill Gates did say that it‚Äôs weird AF and he‚Äôs weird AF. When you‚Äôre a hammer, everything‚Äôs a nail. He needs to get his weird fucking ass out of the spotlight because he‚Äôs seriously giving vaccines a bad name.</p>

        <p>Missed the point. The point is that when a country becomes more developed and infant/child mortality rates drop, population growth declines as a whole. IE, education and reducing mortality rates is a method of reducing population growth. Thats why the US and European (and other developed) countries have population growth rates much closer to 1 than undeveloped 3rd world countries. I'm not disagreeing with your statement about education and contraceptives. I actually agree with you on that. 
Yeah lockdown has made certain things extremely difficult, (and statewide lockdowns aren't the solution when you have counties with no cases being subjected to the same restrictions as high population density areas) but access to proper educational and contraceptives is an issue that goes beyond covid (at least in the US). 
Obviously he wasn't alive during then, I was talking about mortality rates during those times</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick but you‚Äôre conflating causation (vaccines account for lower birth rates bc mothers aren‚Äôt hedging their bets) with correlation (vaccines are a mark of a developed nation and developed nations for a whole bunch of reasons have lower birth rates) LOTS of things come together to make a population ‚Äúdeveloped.‚Äù And a great many of them affect birth rates.

        <p>Nah you're good, it's not a direct correlation but there is a correlation. Also, the saying goes correlation doesn't mean causation, you're essentially agreeing with me by saying "conflating causation with correlation". Eg, correlation between shark attacks and ice cream sales, no actual causation (correlation  because of temperature). Obviously vaccines don't solve everything but it's a piece of the puzzle that helps. My main argument is about mortality rates, and how preventing diseases reduces those rates. 
There's a reason why the FDA and other major organizations have extremely extensive research and testing cycles/durations, to discover any unforseen side effects. There is no one thing solves everything, but it's hard to build a bridge without the keystone. 
Like I said, it's only one aspect, you're completely right in stating it's not the only thing that marks a developed country, but it does play a role. 
Again, one of the leading causes of child mortality is disease</p>

        <p>So that's why we have rampant polio? You do know what an iron lung is right? You do know FDR had polio and couldn't walk because of it. How many cases of polio or other vaccinated diseases do you see or hear about unless people have stopped taking the vaccine.

        <p>Ah yes, a non peer reviewed study that also relies on vaccines causing autism, from the renowned study that was completely falsified and proven to have results that were non-replicable. Where the doctor who published it had is medical license revoked.
And the first vaccine was a smallpox vaccine where the guy literally took a sample from a cow (cowpox) and prevented his kid from getting small pox. 
https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.24.3.611 
And yeah, I do know what goes into vaccines, except the ingredients that are used to make the disease inert are purged from what actually gets injected. Btw, apples have cyanide in them, tuna and other seafood have heavy mercury that can't be purged from your body. Long scientific names don't make something inherently dangerous, di-hidryogen monoxide kills 100% of the people who ingest it. 
And no, the government doesn't know best but the people who have spent decades testing and researching the topic might know what they are doing. Perfect example of this is when states closed down public parks when rona first started.
