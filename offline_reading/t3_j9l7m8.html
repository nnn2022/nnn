        <p>the NWO pedophiles will never control my mask or my seminal fluids that they want to use to start a fascist state. The shifty "you know whos" with their plot to take over decent hard working americans is disgusting and has been planned since at least the 60s when they rose to power when we should stamped them out then...</p>

        <p>Ultimately the struggle for freedom which I believe started in 1945, was exacerbated in the 60's and again by matters of exponent now is fought everyday  and freedom will win in the long run.  The natural state of existence is broken, entropic soup.  For complexity to build, it requires an ever narrowing of conditions to the point of trepidation and I survivability.  </p>
<p>These globalists and power hungry do-gooders of duplicity should have been crushed 60 years ago.  I could not agree more, but they were not.  I postulate that conditions will worsen as global complexity grows before reaching carrying capacity aided and abetted by the exploitation of an intrinsic human instinct of adaptation.  The human animal is designed to adapt and ever march forward, which whilst under normal conditions leads to an ensured survivability of the species, also constructs a pathway towards enslavement as individuals adapt further away from life, liberty, and property towards ideals of risk averse utopias supplanting the natural tendency to worship a higher power in a spiritual capacity.</p>
<p>Today's man, supplicated into submission via erasure of imagination wrought by pervasive and encumbering stimuli has forgotten a primordial truth that life is created in the image of the gods.  This sentiment has been perverted to mean the gods chose an image for man to take but rather that man in and of his intrinsic existence is in likeness to the image of the gods in his ability to create.  I maintain that the manufacturing of this pandemic was done in design to further this stated perversion.  It will work for a time no doubt, as the current state of affairs is assured to sink to untold depths before rising again, but it will rise.</p>
<p>To deny one's ability to create and one's town's likeness to the gods is to deny the very existence of the self which can only manifest in a stark cognitive dissonance which may be alleviated via all manner of drugs but can only be reconciled through an acknowledgment of man's freedom to create which of course is logically succeeded by man's responsibility to create in the likeness in which he was created.</p>
<p>Today's drug of choice is collectivism, the ultimate eschewing of responsibility and repudiation of self interest as vessel of growth.  What concerns me, is not the addiction, as all addictions end in death or recovery, but rather the undeniable fact that this drug has the power to belie those who do not drink of its cup by tangential parasitism as it spews like tendrils of the kracken out from it's most intoxicated addicts.</p>
<p>It is thus my sincerest hope that the combination of collectivism with the hedonistic indulgence in baseless emotions ever stomed by flames of social media will sooner or later give rise to a new age of post industrial stoicism where individuals take matters of streamlining complexities into compatible efficiencies into their own hands and forsake our contemptuous overlords.</p>
