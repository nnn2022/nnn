<p>&rt;‚ÄúWe suggested that traditional methods of risk communication and community engagement should be explored to track and fact-check misinformation as ways to <strong>immunise people against misinformation</strong> and thereby pre-empt potential vaccine program disruptions,‚Äù the researchers wrote in their paper.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;While anti-vaccination groups may argue with sentiments that the claims they propagate are harmful, Dr Homaira pointed out that <strong>vaccines themselves are a public health good which go through rigorous trials and are subject to rigorous regulation prior to being available to the public.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄúClearly when a vaccine comes into play, it is not intended to harm you <strong>because the scientific community would never let that happen</strong>. So when a minority of people spread propaganda to halter or affect that pathway, that is clearly an intention to harm,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Between 10 January and 30 November last year, there were three ‚Äúwaves‚Äù of COVID-19 vaccine rumours and conspiracy theories, falling between February and May, June and September and October and November. The second wave boasted the largest spike of misinformation when compared to the first and third waves.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>These waves correlated to the volume of internet searches for vaccines and lined up to the various waves of COVID-19 as it ran rampant through most of the world</strong>, particularly in countries with large populations such as the USA, India and Brazil.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;‚Äú<strong>All of us have someone who we have lost to this pandemic or was affected by the pandemic</strong>. So we should really learn from this, build on our experience and really leverage the capacity that has been strengthened to address this pandemic globally so we are much more resilient as a global population, and also as a country, to address future health crises.‚Äù</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The researchers also did not investigate rumours and conspiracy theories which were spread off the internet through <strong>avenues such as word of mouth</strong>. However, Dr Homaira noted this sort of misinformation would be similar to those spread online.</p>
