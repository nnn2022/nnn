    <strong>Vaccine help? New here</strong>
    <p><p>New to this sub. So I am currently non vaccinated due to personal reservations. My whole family has been except myself and daughter. I feel pressure to get it from work and my family.Finding proper data on it to weigh the pros and cons has been difficult. Maybe I’m just looking for some help or clarity. Not a troll, just can’t go anywhere else on Reddit without being bullied about it.(Edit.) Just got banned from other subs for joining this one, WTF</p>
<p>Edit 1Thanks for all the science, studies, and words of wisdom. Y’all are more wholesome than the rest of Reddit!</p></p>

<p>Please don't cave in to the pressure. I'm the only non vaccinated of everyone I know too but these vaccines are still in their trialling phase meaning you are the experiment. They have no idea if these cause long term issues or not!</p>

        <p>Thanks. That is my concern, I am kind of a health nut.Been made fun of my whole life for being “organic” and living a clean lifestyle. And now all of my friends who were health nuts are jumping on this train. Something just doesn’t feel right. Just needed to know some like minded people are out there. It’s a lonely position deciding not to get it</p>

        <p>Listen to your intuition, also they want you to think the majority are fully vaccinated. They aren’t- we are still the majority, we tend to just be silent about it outside of here.</p>

        <p>Well, lots of people are concerned about these jabs in particular because part of it's contents allegedly is coated with a nanotechnological substance which protects it to a point where it might stick around to start to messing with your genes. Normal RNA would probably be destructured in a fraction of a second, but because these are protected, there's a fair chance they might become negatively influential by reverse transcription.</p>
<p>It's interesting to note also that the definition of vaccine as well as pandemic, have been "updated" in 2016 and '09.
If they hadn't, health authorities could not call neither of the two for which they do.</p>
<p>Normal vaccines have adjuvants, i.e. heavy metals, and from family anecdotes and personal experience, I'm not a big fan</p>

        <p>Sorry you’re feeling such pressure.  It’s not fair that only “vaccinated” people have the right to make a choice for what’s right for their body but others don’t seem to have that right, according to those “vaccinated” people.  You absolutely have a right to do your own research, ask your own questions, share your own concerns, and choose what is appropriate for your body and your daughter’s body.  </p>
<p>I was just talking to a family member yesterday who was all about these shots and masks.  I’m not welcome at family functions; they’re now “vaccinated” people only are welcome things.  She told me I should get a shot so I could see people.  I asked her if she looked in to what’s even in those shots, if she read about the side effects, if she was told about possible side effects, etc.  Her answers were all No.  You’d probably get all the same responses from your family.  She had a canned response for every other question I asked but nothing actually made sense.  </p>
<p>So my response to you is if things don’t make sense and don’t feel right, there’s something wrong.  Perhaps you won’t be able to put your finger on what’s wrong, but you know things aren’t right.  Don’t put something foreign in to your body unless you feel 100% clear in your body about it.  Even a pain pill a doctor wants to give you…. read the papers on it and know what’s in it and what the effects are and still feel into your body to feel how it “sits” with you before taking that pill.  Ask certain questions to people who have taken a shot and see if their answers have holes in them or just sound way off or canned.  Can these folks back up things they tell you (or is it all things they’re repeating from what the TV news or some social media or advertisement said)?</p>
<p>I don’t know the truth 100% on any of this.  But what I do know is nothing has made sense, nothing said on the mass media has been consistent, and even taking an experimental shot of unknown crap for a virus that doesn’t kill many HEALTHY-ISH people just makes no sense.  Plus all the bribing states are doing to coerce people getting this shot…. college tuition, lottery money, beer, pizza, donuts, weed….. And this all is breaking up families, friends, and putting pressure on people.  It’s turned lots of things in life ugly.  In my opinion, it’s not a good thing.  I know something just isn’t right about any of this for sure.  </p>
<p>What would have made sense is, if there was a true health risk, governments would have spent money and time on educating people how to be healthier, how to build or keep their immune system up and take care of their emotional needs.  Parks and gyms wouldn’t have closed.  People wouldn’t have been told to “stay indoors” and watch tons of TV.  They’d have been encouraged to exercise, get fresh air, go in to nature and get or stay connected with the earth, eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, not gorge themselves on take out fried foods, pizzas, and garbage.  They’d have been encouraged to form close relations with neighbors to keep an eye out for each other, reach out to people in order to keep depression away, not shut yourself in and withdrawing from the world and other humans.</p>

        <p>The primary reason I refused the vaccine was the coercion. On that basis alone I will not take it. Locked us down harder than before and tied re opening to vaccination rates? Thats some serious dystopian shit they are pushing. I'm not going to participate.</p>

        <p>Look up Robert Malone if you want a serious MD opinion on the covid jab, he invented mRNA vaccines and has since been censored for talking about ivermectin. This is because the emergency authorization for covid shot is contingent on there being no other treatments.</p>

        <p>Wow, thanks for the very detailed response. You put my thoughts into word better than I could have done. What you hit on reminds me of what we know of the bubonic plague. People locking themselves away and allowing their immune systems to go to garbage. It means a lot hearing reasons for not getting vaccinated that aren’t backed in political reasoning but common sense.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system could be counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are often reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to this, <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/thousands-of-women-report-hemorrhaging-reproductive-dysfunction-miscarriage-after-corona-shots">the numbers with regard to fertility changes in women</a> strongly suggest that the vaccine has a negative impact on fertility and on pregnancy, which is congruent with <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/05/04/pfizer-confirms-covid-vaccine-shedding-leading-to-menstrual-cycle-disruption-is-possible/">what vaccine companies already knew was possible, even prior to release</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">large study</a> of the “safety and efficacy” of the vaccine has a huge hole in it—they merely vaccinated participants and then hoped and prayed they would come into contact with the wild virus by chance. But there is no guarantee of exposure—far from it—so there is no actual test of safety OR efficacy, when you consider that most lab animals in previous coronavirus vaccine trials (which were systematically exposed to the virus they were vaccinated against) died of ADE, especially if they seemed to develop perfect antibodies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://id.elsevier.com/ACW/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com%2Faction%2FconsumeSsoCookie%3FredirectUri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.thelancet.com%252Faction%252FconsumeSharedSessionAction%253FI2KBRCK%253D1%2526JSESSIONID%253DaaaxMgxF_jwLS9MicyuOx%2526MAID%253DnwtDnnX6yA6uoIcAtieLwQ%25253D%25253D%2526SERVER%253DWZ6myaEXBLF%25252B9vQ18y9JMw%25253D%25253D%2526ORIGIN%253D844971718%2526RD%253DRD%2526exp%253D75icYvzOgUVEevYEfIgkYg%2525253D%2525253D%26code%3Dnull"><em>largest</em> study</a> of the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines also has a glaring problem with it—it does not account for the incongruent testing of vaccinated breakthrough versus unvaccinated/general cases. The hospitalization rate of the unvaccinated is higher simply because the COVID test for vaccinated breakthrough versus an unvaccinated person is different. The one for the unvaccinated uses an <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/Ct_Fact_Sheet.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value between 35 and 40</a>, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">even Fauci admits produces a useless result, that is, a 40-90% false positive rate</a>. The one the possible vaccine breakthrough cases given, on the other hand, uses a much more reasonable <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value less than or equal to 28</a>. What this means is that a lot more unvaccinated people are actually being misdiagnosed when they go to the hospital than vaccinated people are.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure if this answers what you’re asking, but the virus, as I said in my previous comment, has never been systematically given to people in a scientific trial to observe symptoms, likely for “ethical” reasons.</p>
<p>As for the second part of your question, it seems like you started writing in the middle of a thought, so you’re going to have to start from the beginning, and explain more specifically what you want to know.</p>

        <p>Just tell people you got vaxxed.  How are they going to know different?</p>
<p>Next time they bring it up - "Hey, you know what?  I meant to tell you, you convinced me.  You were right - so I went to (insert local vaccine site, drug store, etc) and got my first shot."</p>
<p>Get a colorful bandage, stick it to your arm and #vaccinated on your social media.</p>
<p>Then maybe they'll shut up about it.</p>

        <p>Welcome!</p>
<p>I worked in a medical research setting for a while, and one major trick used all the time is to market something and then make it really, really hard to find the actual data. I've tried to find good data on these vaccines and found it remarkably difficult to find, and so it's not just you: it genuinely is very difficult to find good data. More than 95% of the time, this is because the actual data does not support the marketing. What this means is a very good question, but it does suggest that this is not a no-brainer decision.</p>
<p>Also, one very useful trick is to reframe the discussion: it is not your job to explain why you don't want it, it is their job to explain why you should. Not taking something is the default unless there's a good reason to do so. Can they give it to you? </p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

        <p>Thanks, it does. It gives me more confidence in my decision thus far. I’m pretty pragmatic and try to make my decisions based on facts and numbers a opposed to emotions so studies are important</p>

        <p>It just doesn’t make sense to take the vax right now. It is untested, and you have no recourse should you suffer any negative effects. A rushed job is a shoddy job, and the last thing I’d want to do is inject an untested substance past my body’s natural filters and directly into my bloodstream, where is will spread throughout my entire body.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it’s been over a year, and I’ve yet to have seen anyone drop dead from Covid. We shoulda had homeless people, druggies, and gang members dead on the streets, just from the lack of sanitation. Third world countries should have been decimated by a pandemic, but they’re doing about as good as they were before.</p>
<p>This virus has been massively overblown, and I just don’t have a reason to inject an untested substance to protect myself against what is quite literally the common cold. (Look it up)</p>
<p>I’m not a lab rat, and neither are you. Good luck out there, and stay safe.</p>
