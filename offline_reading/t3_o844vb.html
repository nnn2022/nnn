<title>I made a post yesterday asking about how the vaccine is causing breakthrough episodes in people with affective mental disorders, such as bipolar and schizophrenia. Tonight I did some research. This is what I found in just 30 minutes of researching. I plan to look into this more tomorrow.</title>

    <strong>I made a post yesterday asking about how the vaccine is causing breakthrough episodes in people with affective mental disorders, such as bipolar and schizophrenia.

    <p><p>One of the genetic factors that plays into the development of Bipolar Disorder are certain genes on chromosome 6. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) is an important part of the human immune system, and is controlled by genes on chromosome 6. It encodes cell surface molecules specialized to present antigenic peptides to the T-cell receptor (TCR) on T cells. These cell surface molecules are proteins.</p>
<p>According to a study done by  <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/doSearch?ContribAuthorStored=Tamouza%2C+R">R. Tamouza</a> et al.Â at Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, the role of pathogen-driven immune activity in BD has been supported by a number of studies showing prenatal/perinatal exposure to various pathogens, including Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, or influenza viruses to be associated with an increased risk of BD in the offspring.</p>
<p>HLA genetic diversity, which conditions the specific adaptive immune responses, has been widely explored in disease association studies <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acps.12912?saml_referrer#acps12912-bib-0017">17</a>, especially those classified as autoimmune disorders <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acps.12912?saml_referrer#acps12912-bib-0015">15</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acps.12912?saml_referrer#acps12912-bib-0017">17</a>-<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acps.12912?saml_referrer#acps12912-bib-0019">19</a>. Inter-individual differences in susceptibility to or protection against autoimmune disorders are likely mediated by the unique peptide-binding functions of these highly polymorphic HLA molecules, given that they are key players in generating specific adaptive immune responses <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acps.12912?saml_referrer#acps12912-bib-0017">17</a>.</p>
<p>The polygenic contribution to the risk of major psychiatric disorders, especially schizophrenia (SZ) and to a lesser extent, BD, has been confirmed in landmark genome-wide association studies (GWAS), where the MHC was the locus of highest statistical significance <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acps.12912?saml_referrer#acps12912-bib-0020">20</a>-<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acps.12912?saml_referrer#acps12912-bib-0023">23</a>, strongly implying impaired immune regulation in the etiology of these disorders. However, the contributing MHC-linked risk factors and their genetic variance remain unknown for BD.</p>
<p>To sum it up: affective mental disorders are caused by many different factors, but the polygenic variability of chromosome 6 is one genetic contributing factor. Also located on chromosome 6 is the HLA gene, which codes for critical human immune responses, including cellular target molecules. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines release spike proteins throughout the body. As was leaked in the Pfizer Japan data, such proteins are not only targeting the immune system, but are binding and accumulating in organs such as the ovaries, spleen, and bone marrow. This could explain the link between Bipolar and Schizophrenic breakthrough episodes and vaccinations. If the spike proteins are binding in the HLA region through the bloodstream, it could account for changes in behavior.Â </p>

        <p>I keep noticing all the people with mental disorders who took it had them worsen, even basic depression. Don't want to know what it will do to autistics [me] or those who have OCD, etc.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing! My brother has been in psychosis ever since he got the covid vaccines. ðŸ˜” I think there are some other factors that played a role in this happening to him, but the vaccine definitely triggered him. He has not been like this in over 20 years.</p>
