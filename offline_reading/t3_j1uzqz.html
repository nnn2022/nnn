    <strong>Today we are two...</strong>
    <p><p>... tomorrow an army.</p>
<p>I just met a fellow rebel on the street who said this! I was walking as usual, without a mask on, and he came out of his house and literally applauded me LOL. He was overjoyed to see another maskless face, this is how sad our lives have become!</p>
<p>This is Spain, where it's mandatory to wear the stupid muzzle whenever you leave the house. It's not enforced though, and not even our small-town police force wear masks, but I can see how people are affected by the constant brainwashing through MSM. 90% of TV news are about case numbers and how everybody who doesn't wear a mask is a cold-blooded grandma killer.</p>
<p>Gotta go, got an army to build.</p></p>

        <p>LOL, so many people trying to spoil my joy! Must have hit a nerve, huh? And yes, it happened. And it made me feel really happy and hopeful that not everyone is a fanatic pro-masker.</p>

        <p>It's tough in Spain. My family's in Madrid and when I visited, I saw two people in one week not wearing a mask. People have been subjugated and traumatised.</p>
<p>I completely get your excitement at this little "victory". Civil disobedience is the only way forward in a country that has gone so overboard (there is literally nothing dumber than outdoor mask mandates).</p>

        <p>As a pro-masker I have to say: Mandated masking outdoors when keeping a distance to other people does not make sense at all.</p>
<p>It does make sense in indoor spaces (to prevent aerosols a bit and so symptomatic people do not contaminate surfaces as much) and if you cannot keep a distance (e. g against droplets).</p>
<p>But building an army is an over-reaction. I would suggest you fight against the unreasonable rules (masking when alone outdoors is stupid) but not the reasonable ones. That should actually work.</p>

        <p>I think the UK should just try to get some rational advice on this. Germany is doing well, we had reasonable measures that worked. I am sorry that you have such an incompetent government at a time like this. I get that both Labour and Tories do not really offer any good political choices at the moment. I watched the parliament discussions about Brexit, lots of it was surreal. </p>
<p>Curfew for pubs and restaurants might make sense if there are significant outbreaks in these environments, and people do not comply with milder rules. But then that's on them.</p>
<p>I hope that people can still do outdoor activities, banning that would be stupid (unless, again, people abuse that freedom for mass gatherings without any distancing. ) Everybody should just apply common sense.</p>
<p>I think this is something where Sweden really ought to be an example, as far as I heard, people mostly did not abuse their freedoms and acted responsibly.</p>

        <p>That happened after the first wave of the Spanish flu. Mask burning bonfires and all. Then the second wave hit..</p>
<p>99% surviving means 1% dying. If 70% get it, that'd be around  2 million deaths in the US, more than 60 million worldwide. 1918 repeating... </p>
<p>BTW - before you say but the IFR is even lower than that. It is not if you allow uncontrolled spread, because the HC system will not be able to cope anymore... </p>
<p>You want to go for that? And expect us all to follow? I do value the life of my mother and friends with preexisting conditions higher than that. Also there are potential long term effects not covered by fatality rate..</p>

        <p>More than 1% die (and always have, this isnt new) from all sorts of other pathogens or reasons. Yes dying is actually a part of life and always will be. It makes no sense to pick one cause of death and enter tunnel vision for it. </p>
<p>Yes all life has value. Accepting death doesn’t mean we dont care or don’t value life. It means we understand the risks in life, and choose not to impose inhumane restrictions because of a mere 1% death rate. </p>
<p>Life is not worth living without real and unrestricted social interaction: hugs, smiles, frowns, funny faces, handshakes, kisses.</p>
<p>None of the restrictions are worth giving up true living, even if they worked, which they do not. Viruses do their thing no matter what, as has been proven by the global spread despite all the attempts to stop it.</p>

        <p>I think I can respect the point you are making here. We do differ in our view of what the restrictions are, though. You consider them inhumane, I consider them minor. You think (I guess) that they don't work well. I have seen that they did work (e.g. They stopped the first wave here In Germany in it's tracks within weeks). Life in my opinion is definitely still worth living if we accept some minor temporary restrictions for our future's sake. I see an end and purpose to the measures, you don't seem to. </p>
<p>And actually I also think that the potential long term effects are an unknown and potentially enormous risk factor, which <em>might</em> involve symptoms like earlier dementia, cardiac disease, kidney disease, strokes, chronic fatigue and depression. Some of these are life crippling, some lead to enormous suffering or lost life years. </p>
<p>There are reports which estimate (but do not prove) that these are in double digit percentages for people who had Covid. That would be devastating. Yes, I know, no hard data on that. But I consider the reported cases I have seen from various sides to be credible.</p>

        <p>Yes you are correct, whether the restrictions are inhumane depend on people’s individual natures and life circumstances . 
The population is made up of types like you, but also types like me, and we are both important. </p>
<p>There is really no way to prove masking and etc. helped slow the virus and even if they did, I don’t really get the point in that. The virus doesn’t go away because it gets slowed. It just takes a longer time to make its rounds. </p>
<p>I do get that maybe we want to try to slow the spread to see if we can get a vaccine or a treatment, that only makes sense if it’s for a limited time, more than 6 months and the no-end-in-sight restrictions ruin businesses and livelihoods, make access more difficult for healthcare, (including mental and dental) increase alcohol and drug use, domestic violence and suicides, and keep people from visiting their loved ones. </p>
<p>All those side effects are not worth the slowdown, just as multiple and serious side effects in a medication aren’t worth it to slowdown a progressive and potentially terminal disease.</p>

        <p>Wearing masks inside may be 'less' insane but it's still insane.  In most places that I know of where masks are 'mandatory' (who is the government to claim a right over me to make such rules?), there aren't any meaningfully consistent rules about :</p>
<p>The material (in my state you can use practically ANYTHING, including old unwashed pairs of undies).</p>
<ul>
<li>How thick the material should be.</li>
<li>How it should be designed (hence some people wearing masks with holes in the front).</li>
<li>Whether the mask should 'fit' tightly or not.</li>
<li>Whether it's disposable or not.</li>
<li>How new the mask has to be if it's disposable.</li>
<li>How regularly it should be washed and HOW it was washed if it's not disposable.</li>
<li>How long the mask should be worn before being tossed\washed\replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>etc etc.</p>
<p>We could make a huge list of the ridiculous inconsistencies and lack of standardisation that reduces the whole policy to being meaningless.  It's just 'security theatre'.  MOST people I see (including myself) are wearing cheap disposable cloth masks, which aren't designed for anything more than being born in medical or health settings (or vet clinics) briefly before being disposed of, as a very simple basic prophylactic under controlled settings, and not even that!  I mean REALLY most of the time even in these settings, to be real, they are mostly for show, or to encourage a degree of compliance in the medical workers themselves.  </p>
<p>Now, just today I was an outlet for a major chain fast food restaurant that shall remain unnamed.  I saw about 20 staff members moving around in incredibly close contact, all wearing cloth masks.  I witnessed them touching these masks with their hands literally every couple of seconds in most cases.  If I'd set up a video and recorded what was going on, the number of contacts between hands and mask would, and I'm not exaggerating in the slightest, be in the THOUSANDS within a couple of hours, easily.  They are literally WORSE than having nothing - because in most cases employers aren't going to be putting coughing workers out there to serve food, at this stage anyway, so you have a bunch of otherwise presumably healthy or at least 'asymptomatic' people spreading germs and viruses (including possibly SARS-CoV-2) much more frequently because they are touching their faces MUCH more frequently than usual, and touching mask material which is very likely to 'store' such viruses on the exterior surface.  THEY AREN'T DESIGNED FOR THIS USE.  No learned group of wise elders, masters of science, ever sat down together for a day to read and discuss and weigh up the value in suddenly having everyone wear these masks to prevent the spread of a virus.  It didn't happen.  A bunch of government appointed bureaucrats simply had an 'impression' that masks must help and so the policy wash pushed by politicians who at one stage here were literally 'scoffing' at the notion that masks could help!  </p>
<p>Besides... guess what?  I have NO reason to believe I have the virus, and while I have no desire to get infected or spread, I do not want to wear a mask!  Demanding that I do so or face fines, based on spurious bullshit claims about lowering spread etc, is a violation of my basic rights of freedom of dress, freedom of movement, and freedom of association.  If you think masks are so god, YOU wear one, if they're reasonably effective that should be good enough!  If you care about service workers and feel that masks work, start a fund or start a lobby group to demand companies pay for high quality masks like N95 masks for staff who want them!  Don't accost or violate my right to breathe freely.  They are gross, ridiculous, and I consider it a major violation of my basic liberties.</p>

        <p>I agree that there is lots of inconsistency, and lots of people who do not wear or handle their masks properly. But that does not mean wearing masks is useless, it has shown statistically that it is better than not masking, even given these imperfections. It would be better if we could get properly fitted  masks and training to everyone, but I guess that's not realistic.</p>
<p>As to "You wear a mask, not me": Sure, the thing is, the mask is most effective if worn by the other person. It's not that difficult to understand I think. You could be an asymptomatic Spreader, you don't know. Masks are not perfectly effective, they do help reduce the probability of spread (and maybe also disease severity via reducing initial dose). </p>
<p>When it comes to your rights and freedoms: These are also limited by traffic lights, closed doors, national borders, walls, security checks at airports etc. Why don't you protest against them? The majority is in favor of all these rules, including sensible masking rules (not outdoors alone or so)</p>

        <p>I should be more exact: You could be a presymptomatic or mildly symptomatic spreader. No this has not been disproven, rather the opposite, it has been proven that this is very common. That statement by Deborah Birx (IIRC) has been widely misunderstood. </p>

<p>I still would have no idea it even existed without the media, and I travel for my job.   I guess I’m supposed to be scared though according to the same people who told me isis was trying to kill me for 7 years straight lol</p>

        <p>Well, Terrorism is indeed a scare tactic and it worked on the US. I don't live in the US, sorry, nobody scared us as much about ISIS. Pandemics, on the other hand, have historically been the greatest killers mankind has known. Worse than large scale wars. So, one of them is mostly a scare tactic. The other isn't. Simple..</p>
<p>The thing with a Pandemic is, the spread is exponential if not stopped or mitigated somehow. One day you have a case in your country, three weeks later you have thousands, four weeks later you have tens of thousands a day, and unless you do something, this can go up to millions a day. Deaths always lag behind, so you cannot properly calculate CFR based on current case counts. You have to calculate it on the cumulative case count of approx. 4 weeks ago. That changes a lot.</p>

        <p>&rt; I agree that there is lots of inconsistency...</p>
<p>You are just 'begging the question' here.  Firstly, WHAT statistics show this?  On what basis?  I was never shown any statistics when this was mandated, they were not basing this on 'statistics'.  The fact remains that all the things I've listed are rampant anywhere the masks are mandated.  Rendering the policy useless. </p>
<p>&rt;the mask is most effective if worn by the other person. </p>
<p>If my cloth mask is so effective to reduce the chances, then YOU could easily wear two masks at once, one for you and one for me.  Or get a better quality mask!  I'm not going around demanding you wear gloves on your hands at all times, that would certainly reduce my chances of getting germs or viruses from you.  If masks do "reduce the probability", then wear a better mask.  That way nobody's rights are being trampled, and you can imagine you're safe.</p>
<p>&rt;These are also limited by traffic lights, closed doors, national borders, walls, security checks at airports etc. </p>
<p>Some of these things are 'opt in' requirements, and all involve passive policing that doesn't invade me to the degree of telling me what to wear on my face, and I don't necessarily agree with them anyway.  Suddenly out of nowhere demanding that I wear a mask, based on spurious claims, pretty much zero scientific evidence, to "slow" a virus I don't have and which isn't much deadlier than the common flu, is a massive violation.  "Don't be concerned about sudden impositions of arbitrary rules!" you say.  No, see most of us are reason.  I am reasonable.  If there was a significant threat to life, if the masks worked, I would be happy to VOLUNTARILY wear a mask.  I would bet thousands of dollars my person hygiene is better than the average person, especially the average person making these laws.  A lot of the lockdown was based on Niel Fergusons' "modelling", this is a guy who was secretly meeting with a married woman (open relationship) during the lockdown, when it was suspected by him that the womans husband had the virus!  Sorry, but my day to day hygiene BEFORE this mass-hysteria was vastly better than his or probably most politicians making imposing these outrageous, violating orders.  If the majority of people are in favor of masks, why would they need them to be required?  BEFORE masks were made mandatory (in August where I live), there was NO widespread public call for masks, only a minority of people were wearing them.  There has been no vote, no public discussion, no scrutiny, just a handful of politicians making up these rules practically on a whim.</p>

        <p>No, wearing masks the way the majority of people wear them, has NOT shown to be better than no masks. In the studies, the masks were always worn perfectly, without the touching and touching and touching . </p>
<p>It is a fantasy to think that will happen in real life.</p>
<p>We have known for a long time that it is usually through contact with contaminated surfaces that we pick up viruses and other pathogens. So wearing a masks makes zero sense. Cough into mask. Huff out your breath . Virus is now on masks. Touch your mask. Virus now on fingers. Anything fingers touch now has virus, which typically stays live for at least 24 hours .</p>
<p>BUT — That doesn’t happen <em>without</em> a mask because airborne or droplet-carried pathogens don’t stick to your face. </p>
<p>We have all learned to cough into our elbow, or into a tissue and throw it away. Not strap it to our faces . Lol</p>
<p>Viruses from plain breathing don’t have a trajectory force and they fall to the floor or the ground, which is already loaded with pathogens, yet there are people who are ok with the 3 second rule 😂</p>

        <p>Scientific consensus has moved towards recognizing that - while everything you said is true for most other respiratory pathogens - fomite transmission is less of a factor for Covid. That is why WHO and CDC recommendations changed (together with the recognition of presymptomatic spread). That changes a lot in what you just said. If it were the major driver of infections, Mask mandates would probably drive infection rates up. The opposite is happening, though. </p>
<p>I don't know what happens once it gets really cold, though. The virus seems to survive pretty much forever on surfaces close to freezing point as far as I read.</p>

        <p>Hey i am sorry to say but you are completely missing the point here. I would highly suggest deeply studying the occult and many of the world events, especially those in the US, and try to connect the dots to understand that there is an esoteric organization who is systematically turning human beings into slaves. Wearing a mask might help slightly with not spreading this virus. But by doing so you are communicating your subservience to the new world order. There are greater dangers here than the wuflu trust me. Please try to notice and understand that every time human rights are violated and taken away, it is always for our "health and safety". It is a laughably obvious rhetoric and agenda.</p>

        <p>I said it yesterday, 99% of people in Egypt don’t wear masks, and the entire country has 1,468 active cases, which is less than Australia with its 9 week lockdowns. In return, Egypt’s economy didn’t get wrecked, there is no fear mongering going on there, no fights over masks there, and most of the people still have good mental health.</p>

        <p>You do realize that Egypt has a completely different climate, and that you cannot trust their numbers, right? We have no idea what their infection count and death rate is, they depend on tourism, so they as a nation have all the incentive in the world to hide the true numbers if they are bad.</p>
<p>Egypt is considered a high-risk country by the German authorities. Meaning if you enter Germany from Egypt, you have to quarantine immediately.</p>

        <p>Your point’s not crazy. I would be willing to have a debate about an indoor mask law:</p>
<p>How long do you feel mask laws should be in place? </p>
<p>Should indoor spaces apply to apartments so that poorer people get forced to wear one as soon as they leave their home? </p>
<p>Same question but with public transit...</p>
<p>Does the requirement to wear one while taking a piss at a restaurant make sense?</p>

        <p>I am not an expert, so the following are example rules which might make sense in my opinion: </p>
<p>As long as an area has more than, say, 8 people per 100.000 infected per day. Below that, contact tracing is probably sufficient. Exceptions might apply for high-risk scenarios (nursing homes, mass gatherings etc) </p>
<p>Private indoor spaces: No, as long as you are not throwing a party or have more than (say) 3 households mingling at the same time for more than a few minutes, I would not mandate masks. In any way, private apartments are private: No patrolling people's private spaces ever. So when I say mandate, I don't say this should be enforced except in the most extreme of circumstances (people under actual quarantine order).</p>
<p>In the restaurant: Yes, makes sense Restaurants are mostly a luxury in my opinion, and it is not asking much to wear one. </p>
<p>Public transit: Yes, definitely wear masks. Many at risk people cannot avoid using that. Also it is not too much to ask.</p>
<p>P. S: Best would be if people acted responsibly completely voluntarily. Thing is, they don't seem to do that, so much I learned. Around where I live, people seem tk think that whatever is not forbidden is simultaneously a good idea to do..</p>
<p>Also: Applying common sense is allowed. Just like I might go over a street with a red traffic light if I am completely alone on the road, all rules might have cases where they do not make sense..</p>

That could not be easily be contained because it is spreading before symptom onset, probably airborne.
