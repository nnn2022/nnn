    <strong>Please stop with the fainting/lockup/seizure vids. They don't mean what you think they do.</strong>
    <p><p>There have been many vids posted of people fainting, seizing, etc. directly following getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>This is normal and not the smoking gun some people want to think it is. Some people faint at the sight of blood or needles. Some people faint after a pin prick. These are well documented phenomena we all accept. </p>
<p>The body response that causes this to happen is called a vasovagal response. Though most people simply go limp and faint, some people's brains misfire and they seize. It is completely temporary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527">Vasovagal Response</a>
https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527</p>
<p>It is documented that the vaccines have side effects (including seizing) but vids where this happens within moments of getting the vaccine are not good examples when they can so easily be dismissed.</p>
<p>If you wish to counter the prevailing narrative you need to be a little more rigorous in your presentation of evidence otherwise you appear foolish.</p>
<p>Not trying to throw stones. Simply wishing to elevate the analysis going on here. Iron sharpens iron.</p>
<p>Edit: No reason to be sending me messages calling me a shill. I am simply trying to say we should focus our energy on the multitude of other evidence that can't so easily be explained away as some of these fainting vids.</p></p>

        <p>I can't tell you what to believe. I have seen this first hand several times at blood drives (very rare 1:500 people or so). Those experiences caused me to explain away the vids I was seeing. Thought the evidence was weak and was trying to help out.</p>

        <p>Yeah not talking about fainting after blood loss. I have seen pain from the needle or sight of blood generate these fainting/seizing responses. It is rare though. That is just my experience from some dude on the internet that could be lying. That is why I posted the mayo clinic article. It explains the events pretty well.</p>

        <p>I have a severe needle phobia. The last time I got my blood drawn I had a panic attack and Elizabeth, the hospital receptionist lol, had to hold my hand while I cried through the process. I couldn’t even drive home right away cause I was so emotional. </p>
<p>Needles are severely distressing to me and I’ve still never had a seizure after a shot.</p>

<p>I never claimed this was a frequent event rather that it happens. I know vaccine injured people. I am simply saying some of the vids posted here aren't the best evidence due to the ease of explanation.</p>

        <p>Read the mayo clinic link. It is very short. Seizing is part of the low blood pressure response which causes fainting.</p>
<p>I know the vaccines can cause seizing. Not trying to refute that. Just that the fainting/seizing right after the shot is not some smoking gun evidence when there are simpler explanations than some toxin in the vaccine acting immediately.</p>

        <p>I am not saying the vax doesn't cause side effects. I have simply seen these reactions before and thought they could be easily explained by the vasovagal response which lines up if you read it. </p>
<p>My point was more so that this simply isn't the best evidence when it can so easily be dismissed. Hopefully you understand where I am coming from.</p>

Normally when they inject something that may cause certain events (tried and tested) they have adrenaline shots on the side incase things go wrong.

        <p>I am glad you brought this up. Another logical explanation for the fainting/seizures, etc. displayed in a lot of these types of videos could be allergic reactions.</p>
<p>This is important to track and understand but is to be expected to some degree and would not serve as much of a deterrent for the pro-vax crowd. Many medicines have a certain percentage of the population who are allergic. It should be monitored to understand what that % is.</p>
<p>At the end of the day I still think "some people are allergic to the vaccine" would be near the bottom of my list for reasons to not take the covid vax. To each their own I suppose.</p>

        <p>Seriously. Comes down to that old adage, "much easier to fool someone than to convince someone they have been fooled". In this case they have fooled themselves. </p>
<p>Much more important to dunk on the vaccine worshippers than to use their brains. So sad. That is why so many people who show skepticism to the narrative are ridiculed. They get lumped in with these turds.</p>
