    <strong>It's simply unfair they are giving old people a few years, whereas taking our BEST YEARS as youngsters</strong>
    <p><p>This may come as COLD. Please tell me is this COLD and VULGAR? I am just stating the facts here. They are literally taking our LIVES away! </p>
<p>I am simply saying, lockdowns isn't the way. OK yeah death is bad, but lockdowns make us youngsters lose these years. All those old people lived their lives anyway, what about us? Can you see the unfairness in this? I should've been partying and stuff but instead I am sitting at home doing nothing. This has changed me greatly, I am depressed like hell. I am not a normal person now probably. Here we lose our lives, give to the old people, who might already die anyway. Can you see the irony? Call me grandmakiller w/e. Lockdown them if that was so neccessary.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely! I truly believe that most of the idiot general public would do literally anything at all, if it could be construed as "doing the right thing and helping the community" and being noticed for having done so. The braindead among us are addicted to that dopamine hit that comes from collective emoting and in-group recognition of their supposed "goodness". It's pathetic.</p>

        <p>Nope it’s not cold. Anything over 80 is a fucking good life, nobody cares what you died of you did better than 90% of people who have walked this earth time to go before you start shitting yourself.</p>
<p>I was reading an article earlier calling for another lockdown from the 3rd wave starting in the UK and stricter rules because their 92 year old grandparent died of Covid. There is now no limit on age, if you don’t live forever it’s all because of Covid and the unvaccinated are probably to blame. </p>
<p>We used to say things like “they had a good innings” now it’s a tragedy that they only
lived to 92. </p>
<p>Common sense - zero.</p>

        <p>Agreed, young people are missing out on jobs and education and our entire futures are being destroyed. We'll be taxed for years to come because of the economic impacts of a policy we didn't want and didn't need...and that's if you're lucky enough to be a taxpayer because so many of us are missing out on the opportunities we need to get a good start in life. But ok, whatever. As mad as I am, I needed this. It woke me up to what the world is really like...I'm grateful that at least now I know and I can do my best to protect myself rather than being a stupid sheep.</p>

        <p>Not a few years where I live. The average age of death matched the age of life expectancy until the vaccine came out. A study in Sweden found the people they researched, 70% of the cases, lost between 5 - 9 months of life expectancy.</p>
<p>So, you are saving them almost nothing.</p>

        <p>It’s not cold. It’s not selfish. The old are supposed to sacrifice for the young. As soon as this shit started, I resented how young people were forced to stop living their lives and miss out on a lot of important milestones all in the name of saving the lives of people who have already lived 80 years. I thought I was just as selfish for feeling the way I did. But really it’s not selfish. Selfish is the boomer who got to go to the prom, experience all the senior year activities, go to college, get married, travel, have all these life experiences then demand the younger generations stay and stop living because they were scared of the virus! I saw plenty of boomers like this. (And plenty who weren’t scared and were against lockdowns). There are a lot of teenagers who didn’t get to play sports and participate extra curricular activities during their junior And senior year. No prom. No sports. Nothing. How youth were robbed of a sports scholarship because they couldn’t play their senior year? How many were robbed of an academic scholarship because of the scam known as “remote learning”??? All because of a virus that is most deadly to people who have already lived 70-80 years! How many missed celebrating important milestones? Many times last year when people said “just stay the fuck home, there’s always next year”, I thought “tomorrow is never promised. Why should I stay home NOT LIVING and miss out on milestones and making memories when there is no guarantee I will be here next year”? Selfish is living in fear and demanding everyone else do the same.</p>

        <p>Same for a lot of Americans. Here in CA, some schools did have prom and in-person graduations but last years senior class got nothing. Public school kids weren’t allowed back to school until late March/early April 2021 but some schools chose to stay closed.</p>

        <p>I'm glad at least some of them got graduations and proms this year. Our schools have been open and shut at least twice this year. I think the elementary/high school kids have spent, at most, a total of four and a half months in regular school (virtual "school" the rest of the time).</p>

        <p>I can tell you first hand, the 80+ year olds are generally not into this BS - they are more clever and tenacious than you know. Some of them just don't have any choice, if they've ended up in a care home and are getting stuck against their will. Not like they have a choice to reject it in that situation.</p>
<p>The others not in LTC and other care facilities? They're REALLY not into this BS, and they are the first to say "No no no, don't lock these young kids up on my account"Really, this is the REALITY.</p>
<p>Don't listen to all the manufactured hate against "Boomers" and Older. I have firsthand experience with them as customers and I know where their heart is when I have conversations with them. They think this is tragic and are very sad that younger folk are being delayed in their lives.</p>
<p>PS. Note the hypocrisy and conflicting views held by the same group from Cult of the Mask.. they hate Boomers and older, then the next use "Dont kill Grandma " to manipulate others. Don't buy into it.</p>

        <p>There were many older people who suffered far more under lockdowns than they would have if they'd just been allowed to live out their days.  Some chose assisted suicide because the thought of staying isolated for who knows how long was too much.</p>
<p>I go back to the quarantine sick people argument.  Many of the elderly weren't sick (with covid or any coronavirus) before they were sealed inside the LTC homes.  Many would have had a few more years, and the ones who would have died from covid would likely have died from a flu strain, or pneumonia perhaps.  That's not cold, it's normal.</p>
<p>Your comment is not cold and vulgar - it's what normal is.  The lockdowns did nothing but harm the population.  When I watch stuff from when the flu was running rampant a decade ago it seems weird that people talked about it a lot, some wore masks, and then suddenly - poof it disappeared.  It's what would have happened this time too had there not been intervention.</p>
<p>However, we have toddlers that don't know how to respond to a naked face, children who have been taught they are 'bad' or 'dirty' for breathing unmasked air, teenagers who have lost critical time for development, young adults who are vehemently on one side or the other of the lockdown issue (out of emotion only), older adults (my category) who are sick of the interventions and just want our lives back, and elderly who are all tired of it and many of whom are angry even if they are divided in beliefs.</p>
<p>The lockdowns should never have happened.  Quarantine the sick, take precautions if you're concerned, but lives, education, and industry should never have been impacted as they were.</p>
