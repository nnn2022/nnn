    <strong>It was all about the collective good... Until it wasn't.</strong>
    <p><p>For at least a century, governments, NGOs, the media, and the academy have endlessly pushed the idea of "the collective good" being the holy grail of civil society. We have been endlessly admonished to accept more and more constraints on our lives to this purpose. But we also (until recently) have accepted that this idea lives within certain practical constraints.</p>
<p>IIRC, the idea was summed up in science fiction as "the greater good for the greater number".</p>
<p>One of the core concepts of this was an actuarial-style calculation of risk vs. benefit vs number of people affected, for example:</p>
<p>- No one mandates airliners carry parachutes, event though they could "save hundreds of lives". The cost and logistical ass-pain to the majority of doing this outweighs the perceived benefits.</p>
<p>- You don't have a Formula 1 style roll cage, harness, fireproof suit, and helmet while driving your Camry to work - because someone determined the number of deaths it would prevent didn't balance against the costs everyone would bear.</p>
<p>- We could ban smoking and alcohol, but the negative effects on society as a whole would outweigh the lives saved (see Prohibition).</p>
<p>So what has happened with the 'Rona? Suddenly the concept of the primacy of "the collective" has been tossed aside. We impoverish, starve, imprison, and mentally assault the vast majority of society so that Grandma can have another 6 months of "life" laying in a nursing home bed. We throw away our rights and our Constitutions and literally allow our governments to dictate who we me associate with and when, where we may go, and what items we may buy - all to ensure 400 pound diabetics with heart problems and COPD don't "die before their time".</p>
<p>It's a total inversion of any norms we have ever known. It's mind-blowing that so few people ask "Why?".</p>
<p>Most of us here already know the answer to that question - when the elites initiate a "Great Reset" of societal norms (like the 60's, the SJW craze, and now the Rona), it's always about social control, the concentration of wealth, and the concentration of power.</p></p>

        <p>Reminds me of Spock sacrificing himself, saying "the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one". </p>
<p>It's a wonderful philosophy if one so chooses to adopt it, yet becomes incredibly problematic when that philosophy is forced upon a society.</p>

        <p>Don't misunderstand me - I am not a collectivist. I am merely pointing out the hypocrisy on display.</p>
<p>The balance between the needs of the many and the needs of the few has been a burning societal question since man formed societies in the first place. Of all attempts to square the circle, the Founding Fathers came the closest to getting it right. Their solutions worked pretty well for about 200 years.</p>
<p>Now the collectivists are doing their damnedest to burn it all to the ground and send us all back to serfdom.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Also, many confuse collectivism and the "rule of the majority" - they are not the same thing.</em></p>

        <p>Collectivism is tyranny by another name. The greater good can easily be defined to be whatever those in power want. Individual rights are the way to go.</p>
