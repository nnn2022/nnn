    <strong>My thoughts on people getting covid after vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Lets dont be stupid. This is war. And the art of war is to trick as many, maybe even sacrifice your own, to win a battle.</p>
<p>Dont you find it odd that they now talk how vaccinated people could spread the disease? Now after they talked so nicely about the vaccine, they ended flatlined probably 45% to 55%. Its known now how many want it and how many dont want it. 
But its not good enough for the global elites.</p>
<p>So they scare now the unvaccinated that they cannot enter public places if not, so they could hurry up. But it fails again.</p>
<p>The next step could be tricking everyone into the vaccinated starting to spread. So we piss in our pants and take the covid21 vaccine which will be way worse.</p>
<p>While politicians move freely around as nothing happened. Only this shows how unprofessional a pandemic this is. 
They should be the first ones to be isolated and vaccinated, but they behave the other way around. 
So I stand my ground and I dont give a damn like before. Aint being tricked like a kid. </p>
<p>The elites cannot risk a disease to kill themselves. Especially an airborn disease. 
Thats why this stupid thing was made with HIV inserts. 
It will only affect those who have a â€žreceiverâ€œ. Those who got the jab.</p>
<p>And a health passport could reveal that. 
But the health passport is a trojan horse.
It can be taken advantage of and lockup people with other diseases in future.</p>
<p>So Im not getting fooled by FUD.
Soon the economy will be smashed, millions will lose their jobs and homes.
Inflation is inevitable.</p></p>

        <p>I believe the vaccine is causing the virus and spike proteins to spread even more and will lead to more and more deaths. Look up dandelion leaf extract spike proteins on dudckduckgo. Also pine needle tea of course.</p>

        <p>The moment the virus is in your body the immune system kicks on just like any other virus. Our immune system attacks the virus body as well as the spike protein generating a robust immune response creating excellent natural antibodies. This battle typically for the average person takes a week or two.</p>
<p>mRNA is relatively unstable and does not last long in the cell. It breaks down relatively quickly. The mRNA in this vaccine has been stabilized. It does not break down very fast at all. It stays in the cell for up to 4 to 5 weeks that we know of. During that time it is constantly churning out Spike protein that could end up anywhere in the body. You have four to five weeks of constant bombardment where the spike proteins can go farther and harder than they would in a normally infected person.</p>
