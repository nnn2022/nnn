<p>&rt;Rashid Ali Buttar (born January 20, 1966) is an American osteopathic physician, conspiracy theorist, and anti-vaccine proponent from Charlotte, North Carolina. He is known for his controversial use of chelation therapy for numerous conditions, including autism and cancer. He has twice been reprimanded by the North Carolina Board of Medical Examiners for unprofessional conduct and cited by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for illegal marketing of unapproved and adulterated drugs.</p>
<p>I'm not sure this is exactly the guy I'd want to be taking medical advice from.</p>

        <p>This is the same kind of crap they always say about anti-vaxxers, no matter who they are. Anti-vaxxers go against the narrative and so government and medical communities (aka Big Pharma) try to defame them at all costs. They control the narrative through publishing whatever studies they want, including fabricated ones. It's just like being anti-lockdown at this point. Do you <em>REALLY</em> trust the "experts"?</p>
<p>I'm not going to pretend that I know everything about vaccination, but I will say that historically there have been many vaccines that have caused serious harm and death that were released onto the public, and that there's a growing trend of mandatory vaccines in the world, which is a violation of bodily autonomy and should be rejected outright.</p>
<p>The way that they're scrambling and rushing to get a COVID-19 vaccine should invoke serious skepticism towards that particular vaccine <em>AT LEAST</em>, if not towards vaccines as a whole.</p>

        <p>I have a half dozen doctors, nurses, or PAs in my family. Every one of them has a lot more medical schooling than I do. Every one of them is in favor of the existing vaccine schedule. And yes, I <em>REALLY</em> trust them.</p>

        <p>Well that's just fine and dandy for them, and for you.</p>
<p>If the American vaccination schedule is the end-all-be-all and a medical silver bullet, then why isn't the rest of the world following it to a T? Why does America have the most aggressive vaccination schedule of them all? Do Americans just need more vaccines than everyone else?</p>
<p>The video in the OP makes a great post. Always ask the question "Why".</p>
<p>EDIT: I should also note that in reality, "anti-vax" isn't just a black and white thing. There's varying levels of skepticism towards vaccines, starting with "Oh maybe this COVID-19 vaccine is too rushed and is being treated like a cash grab."</p>

        <p>You can look at the rush for a covid vaccine as a cash grab, sure. Or you can look at it as a desire to not have to put up with this "new-normal" any longer than necessary. That's certainly why I want it.</p>
<p>And you're not wrong about vaccines having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome#:~:text=Some%20cases%20may%20be%20triggered,1000)%20recipients%20developed%20the%20complication.">caused problems</a> in the past. The cases of Guillian Barre syndrome related to the 1976 flu vaccine and cases like it are why <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html">Vaers</a> was created in the 1990's. It's why we have phase 3 and 4 trials of vaccines with tens and hundreds of thousands of people being followed up with. It's why so many (15-20%) vaccines which <em>work</em> don't make it out of phase 3 trials. There are safety concerns or side effects which are found which are unacceptably high. </p>
<p>We know there are potential issues with vaccines. That's why there is testing and ongoing monitoring. But we also know that vaccines are one of the strongest public health tools developed over the past century or two. And it's likely the only way that we get back to normal.</p>

        <p>If a doctor or nurse can wear an n95 mask for a 12 hour shift with no detectable drop in blood O2 level, I'm pretty sure a cloth or surgical mask worn for a 30 minute grocery trip isn't going to cause problems.</p>

        <p>How do know there is no drop in co2 levels? You don’t.. My friend works in a hospital. She gets light headed and nausea daily now. She finds her breathing becomes too shallow. She wears glasses that fog up obstructing her vision. Not helpful in any way.</p>

        <p>O2 levels and CO2 levels are two different things.</p>
<p>O2 levels can be measured by a pulse oximeter. They are standard at every hospital bed. I'm 100% positive that anyone working in a hospital can take their oxygen levels any time they feel light headed. I've yet to see a single reported case of low O2 in medical staff.</p>
<p>Blood CO2 buildup <em>does</em> happen when wearing an n95 mask for a long period of time. That's not surprising; some amount of rebreathing occurs when you're wearing a mask. Not enough to be dangerous, but potentially enough to be uncomfortable over prolonged periods of time. It could cause symptoms like lightheadedness and shortness of breath. But again, that's wearing an n95 mask for hours on end. Not a cloth mask which is much less restrictive. A few minutes outside in fresh air without the mask will help.</p>
<p>As for glasses fogging up? Yep, happens to me too. If you slide your glasses down your nose a millimeter or so then the mask doesn't direct your breath directly onto to glasses and they don't fog up.</p>
