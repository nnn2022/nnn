        <p>Iâ€™m not hesitant. Iâ€™m refusing, for the 25000th time, using my God-given human right to choose what's best for me or not, to have something put inside my body, that I donâ€™t want and donâ€™t need. </p>
<p>Iâ€™m not undecided. I've been decided for years. I donâ€™t need vaccines and havenâ€™t since I was 14. Iâ€™m doing perfectly fine, thanks. </p>
<p>Iâ€™m isolated from society for a reason. Because Iâ€™m not interested in society bothering me.</p>

        <p>I stopped taking vaccines and pills as a teen because I saw that vaccines made me a carrier for a while, and I caught onto the fact that it was making me sick and therefore turning me into a spreader! Pills were wrecking my mood. I used to be so violent because of them (I mean, Iâ€™m still able to be, but now itâ€™s intentional and well warranted if I become violent, and takes a LOT to get me there lol).</p>

        <p>Yeah my parents made me take pills and vaccines as a kid and I had to get the pneumonia shot when I had pneumonia before.  I hate taking pills too.  I just recently stopped my birth control pill because I don't like all these chemicals in my body. I've given in and taken Tylenol every now and then but I really try to not take anything.<br>
But as an adult I've never gotten the flu shot.  I don't trust it either.</p>

        <p>Same here! I was taking like 8 pills a day because of my mother. As an adult, i broke free from all that. We donâ€™t speak to each other anymore since like 10 years now, and that's for the better! The only thing i take now is Nyquil for my nose every once in a while. I have allergies to something in this house since we moved in. But I'm trying to not use Nyquil anymore, it's just good to knock me out sometimes.</p>

        <p>I get that.  I take a melatonin if I really can't sleep.  But yeah I'm living with my mom right now and she's very promedicine provaxxine and it's hard because I'm scared they're going to come to the door eventually and she's going to keep trying to coerce me.  Her big thing is,  "everyone in our family got the vaccine.  You're the only one.  Don't you want to see grandma,  etc etc.  Nobody will feel comfortable being around you because you are unvaccinated..etc"
She's just still asleep,  along with the rest of my family.</p>

        <p>Oh my... is there anywhere you can move out to? 
I mean, this is about more than just a vaccine, Iâ€™m sure you can tell too by now. Thereâ€™s so much theyâ€™re hiding about this thing. I hope I donâ€™t have to make any big difficult choices like this either. My dad is against it which Iâ€™m really happy about, my mother? She probably took 5 doses by now, she loves pills and shots lol...</p>

        <p>Tbh if I can suggest, try decluttering. Getting rid of unnecessary stuff. I've been doing that over the last year and I could probably fit all my belongings in one SUV if needed. Start preparing your life and steering it in the direction you want way in advance. Especially with parents, they stick like glue. My mother was busy guilt-tripping me and could have filled a cup of crocodile tears when I told her she wouldnâ€™t see my face again and I was moving hours away from her and her monster of a husband. Itâ€™s the least I could do, to leave those who hurt me behind, and seek a better life. I hope things work out for you...
Thereâ€™s a lot of people asleep, but see it this way: you're awake!</p>

        <p>&rt; health officials have embarked on a painstaking effort to get shots to undecided or isolated Americans.</p>
