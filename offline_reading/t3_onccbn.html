    <strong>'Loss' of sense of smell/taste, phantosmia and this specific coronavirus.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I've had phantosmia and olfactory hallucinations since 2015. Guess what caused them? An ordinary cold.</p>
<p>Many viralinfections can cause nerve damage, we were simply never obsessed with broadcasting every little effect of any virus and reporting every symptom. I can't remember if I flat out lost my sense of taste/smell <em>during</em> that particular infection but partial/complete loss has happened many times I've been sick. No it's not purely the culprit of a physically blocked nose, because that's rarely a symptom I get in the first place. When I was trying to figure out what was wrong with my sense of smell, I read that it's common for some superficial damage to occur alongside a viral respiratory infection. This usually heals within days to weeks but can persist like mine has- permanently. I will try to find the article but I read it back in the 2010s so idk what it's become amidst the covid stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway I'm curious. When stuff starts to smell funny, I spray saline into each nostril and tilt my head so that the top of my head is facing towards the floor, then come back up after a few seconds. It's enough to stimulate the nerves as a 'distraction' I'm told. I wonder if this would work for anyone else? I've only tried it on altered smell, not loss- about a year after I'd lived with it and accepted stuff was just not going to taste good anymore. I was happy to find a solution, even if it's just in the moment.</p>
<p>Also I've noticed a lot of people say meat/chicken tastes weird. I've found when my sense becomes altered, all of the 'gross', unpalatable smells/flavors of meat come out and it's almost inedible. I have also developed a tendency to over season food since 2016 so idk if I have dulled senses as well in some areas. For the most part, I seem to get more of the 'wrong' flavors in foods instead of the ones we find appetizing.</p>
<p>Originally I was interested in what would become of research on phantosmia and loss of taste/smell since covid blew up but nothing did and people went nuts so I'm making my own thread I guess. Sorry if that's rambly lol, it's about 4am ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p></p>
