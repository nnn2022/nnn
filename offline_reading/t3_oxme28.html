    <strong>With the way things are going if folks are threatened with their jobs over a jab mandate, what options can one use to exempt themselves from getting the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>This experimental jab is being jammed down our throats. I see the head lines now using words like 'mandatory vaccines'. Could we please start a discussion about our rights. I'm hoping their are some people who know a bit more regarding labour laws and mandated vaccines, human rights, Nuremberg code, health care acts etc..  who could help explain our options while we navigate with caution through these unprecedented times.</p></p>

        <p>not sure how this would work in the workplace but i know for colleges religious exemption is totally an option and i reached out to a lawyer. what my lawyer ended up telling me was that there‚Äôs aborted fetal tissue in the vaccines and that goes against most major religions so if that‚Äôs an option for you i would definitely reach out to a lawyer/ religious leaders in your community. hang in there and don‚Äôt give into their bull shit vaccine üôè</p>

        <p>Turns out I might be a Jehovas Witness‚Ä¶ <em>crazy</em> coincidence! Still not quite sure who the guy is but at least I won‚Äôt be door knocking for a while now ;)</p>
<p>Who knows though‚Ä¶. by the time we‚Äôre free to knock on doors and go into peoples houses and talk to them about it all, I might not be so religious anymore‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs these hard times, the strain, the pressure‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs times like this you really find your faith and take that comfort in the support of God, or Jehova or whatever his name is.</p>

        <p>Nope I know a few of them, no medical no blood transfusions etc. It's God will for you to get I'll and die. But like most cults/religions people pick and choose the bits they like.</p>

        <p>I think this is an option at most schools but lately, I've become concerned that schools will start purging their rolls of exempted students, especially if they were promised scholarships. Two birds, one stone. Look at the BYU student, Olivia Sandor incident. The legal precedents upholding mandates in both private and school sectors have now been established (Houston Methodist, Indiana University), so the walls are closing in. Reprisals against the unvaxxed may start ramping up now. </p>
<p>But, better to stand on principle than kneel as a slave.</p>

        <p>In the uk, veganism is a protected characteristic. Some vegans object to the vax because of how they are produced so forcing you to get one if you‚Äôre vegan means breaching the discrimination laws thus they can‚Äôt force you to have it as it‚Äôs against your beliefs. Not saying you should go vegan before anyone starts the vegan bashing, but if you don‚Äôt want to claim religious exemption then this is an option if you live in the uk‚Ä¶.?</p>

        <p>Laws will vary by country/state. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the way I see vaccines as being mandated nationwide here in the US is through pressuring private businesses to mandate them themselves. Whether it be through a tax break or fines. The government knows they can‚Äôt mandate it federally without a revolution, so they‚Äôll use private companies as the middleman. It soon won‚Äôt be as easy as just getting another job, as there will be no room in this shitty dystopia for clean humans. It‚Äôs how they plan to eliminate all of us before the long-term effects of the vaccine become more apparent. I don‚Äôt see a way out besides a true revolution, guns and all, which I doubt will ever actually happen because we‚Äôre all so spread out. We are easily silenced through online censorship, and not to mention that we could not even begin to plan revolting without evil eyes lurking and being one step ahead‚Ä¶</p>
<p>To the lurking misinformation police: These are just my thoughts, and I am entitled to freely share them. I am not inciting any form of violence either. I am allowed to imagine. Peace.</p>

        <p>It's very unfortunate that it is getting worse fast as we have the mayor of New York mandating  vaccines for anyone going into restaurants, gyms, entertainment venues, etc... and the governor of California mandating vaccines, or weekly tests (take your pick), for all state employees and all the medical workers. Fingers crossed that the latter of the two will be recalled and replaced in September with someone who respects freedom of choice and isn't running an authoritarian shit show. However, I don't have high in the sky apple pie hopes of that happening.</p>
