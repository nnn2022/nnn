    <strong>I do not agree with any of your views. I am just trying to understand all of your points of view.</strong>
    <p><p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have a few completely honest questions for you guys. This is not brigading, this is attempting to get a point of view.</p>
<p>1: What makes it so that every government in the world is lying to you, meaning that world peace has been established because everyone is working together?</p>
<p>2: What is the mindset behind not getting a covid shot? There is rarely any side effects, and the only reason there are any in the first place is because people want to get out of this ASAP.</p>
<p>3: Specifically on masks, what makes you think that they aren't functional? I have firsthand cases of masks working, and as such anti mask mindset is particularly irritating to me.</p></p>

        <p>1) governments love power, and will do anything, including using a pandemic to hold and grow their power and control</p>
<p>2) people that have already been infected with covid do NOT need the vaccine. It’s disgusting that people are trying to force an untested concoction into peoples bodies and shaming them for not doing so. I equate it to republicans and their hard-ons for anti-abortion </p>
<p>3) masks are fucking stupid and dehumanizing. What are these anecdotal first hand cases that you claim?</p>

        <p>I have no way to prove this story true without doxxing myself because of the nature of the internet, but here's my first hand claim.</p>
<p>In my workplace, I follow all of the mask rules. During me wearing a mask, I come into close contact with other people. Just the nature of things.</p>
<p>I caught covid recently because masks do not prevent you from catching it, but from spreading it. None of the people I came into close contact with ever ended up with covid.</p>

        <p>Socialism has never worked and will never work. It's the only economic ideology with a 100% failure rate over a 200 year period. It's also produced the worst dictators in history.</p>

        <p>Awww I hurt your leftist feelings, I dont care. As an ex Marxist-leninist...I probably know more about your shitty ideology than you do.</p>
<p>No its not. Socialism is economic authoritarianism. The definition of socialism is a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole. Now notice it says the means of production, distribution and exchange...well that's an entire economy, making socialism a command economy. Now notice it says regulated by the community...now how does a community regulate things? Through government. So socialism is and always will be a command economy under an authoritarian state. Even Marx called for a state run economy in the 2nd chapter of the communist manifesto.</p>

        <p>Because I know what socialism is. You don't apparently as you cant even define it...bet your tiny brain has never read on book on the theory of socialism...not one
 Have you ever read marx, Engels, proudhon, cockshott, Trotsky, lenin or kropotkin?</p>
<p>Also fascism is a form of socialism. I love proving leftists wrong in this. Did you research this or are you just regurgitating what some leftard told you. I can easily prove it.</p>
<p>Fascism is a form of socialism. And before you say the Fascists can't be socialists because they killed commies..Socialists killing other socialists doesn't make them not socialists. Fascism is a form of national syndicalism. The ideology is an offshoot of Sorelianism...which was named after George Sorel...a syndicalist that believed in traditionalist values and was against the idea of the bourgeois democracy. Sorelianism and marxism share a central ideology...Hegelianism. Now that we have that out if the way. The only difference between fascism and communism is nationalism vs globalism. Hitler went after the commies because they reported to moscow...as a nationalist he couldn't have that as he wanted all socialists to report to Berlin.</p>
<p>There is this book called the "Doctrine of Fascism" written by Benito Mussolini and Giovanni Gentile. An exert from this book: </p>
<p>"Anti-individualistic, the Fascist conception of life 
stresses the importance of the State and accepts the 
individual only in so far as his interests coincide 
with those of the State, which stands for the 
conscience and the universal, will of man as a 
historic entity. It is opposed to classical liberalism 
which arose as a reaction to absolutism and 
exhausted its historical function when the State 
became the expression of the conscience and will of 
the people. Liberalism denied the State in the name 
of the individual; Fascism reasserts
The rights of the State as expressing the real essence 
of the individual. And if liberty is to he the attribute of 
living men and not of abstract dummies invented by 
individualistic liberalism, then Fascism stands for 
liberty, and for the only liberty worth having, the 
liberty of the State and of the individual within the 
State. The Fascist conception of the State is all 
embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values 
can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, 
Fascism, is totalitarian, and the Fascist State — a 
synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values —
interprets, develops, and potentates the whole life of a 
people.
No individuals or groups (political parties, cultural 
associations, economic unions, social classes) outside 
the State."</p>
<p>Then you have an interview with Hitler himself: The following document contains Adolf Hitler‘s explanation of the Nazi form of socialism. It comes from an interview with Hitler conducted by German-American writer and Nazi sympathiser George Sylvester Viereck. The interview appeared in Liberty magazine on July 9th 1932:</p>
<p>“‘When I take charge of Germany, I shall end tribute abroad and Bolshevism at home.’
Adolf Hitler drained his cup as if it contained not tea but the lifeblood of Bolshevism.
‘Bolshevism’, the chief of the Brown Shirts, the Fascists of Germany continued, ‘is our greatest menace. Kill Bolshevism in Germany and you restore 70 million people to power. France owes her strength not to her armies but to the forces of Bolshevism and dissension in our midst’…
I met Hitler not in his headquarters, the Brown House in Munich, but in a private home, the dwelling of a former admiral of the German Navy. We discussed the fate of Germany over the teacups.
‘Why’, I asked Hitler, ‘do you call yourself a National Socialist, since your party program is the very anthesis of that commonly accredited to Socialism?’
‘Socialism’, he retorted, putting down his cup of tea, ‘is the science of dealing with the common weal [health or well-being]. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.
‘Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality and, unlike Marxism, it is patriotic.
‘We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists. We are not internationalists. Our Socialism is national. We demand the fulfilment of the just claims of the productive classes by the State on the basis of race solidarity. To us, State and race are one…"</p>
<p>And now for the definition of socialism: The definition of socialism is  a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.  Now notice the it says means of production, distribution, and exchange...well that's an entire economy top to bottom. So is essence this is a command economy. Notice its also says regulated by the community. Now how does a community regulate things? Through government, through the state. So socialism is a government controlled economy. Even the second chapter of the communist manifesto by marx calls for an economy under the state.</p>
<p>Yes fascism is a form of socialism.  You are so ignorant of history it isn't funny.</p>

        <p>You simp for his ideology so yes I think you marx was great or at least his ideas are. </p>
<p>State control of the economy creates states like the USSR or Nazi Germany. Any idiot with 2 brain cells knows that is a bad idea. Governments are easily corruptable and inefficient. Yes I have a problem with stupid ans it is stupid to want government to manage an economy. Has never ever worked and never will. </p>
<p>Socialism does not work because it is not consistent with fundamental principles of human behavior. The failure of socialism in countries around the world can be traced to one critical defect: it is a system that ignores incentives. This was highlighted recently with the unemployment crisis in America.</p>

        <p>That’s fine, personally I don’t have a problem with socialists on principle.</p>
<p>But wanting people to have access to free/affordable food and housing is not the same thing as agreeing with covid restrictions - lockdowns, travel restrictions, mask mandates and mandatory vaccines.</p>

        <p>I am going to answer 2. Because to do all three would take too much effort.
1. Many people already had covid, me includedand have developed a satisfactory immune response. This immune response will likely last a lifetime. People who were treated for sars in 2013 also mounted a strong immune response to cv19 from an infection 8 years ago. Sars is between 20 and 30% different to sars cov 2. The recent varients approximately 2%. There is little evidence the quaxxines will be able to specifically make a satisfactory immune response to variants</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The products are new and have no long term results on health, the immune system or fertility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The chances of me dying of covid are similar to flu. I have never felt it necessary to take a flu shot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These products do not hold marketing licences and nmprobably never will. The trials are still ongoing and I do not wish to participate in the trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no legal recourse if I become ill from the quaxxine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In one of the animal trials for the sars 2013 quaxxine the rhesus monkeys mounted a very positive immune response against the lab controlled virus. When the animals were released back into the enclosure they were exposed to the wild virus and almost all of the monkeys developed a cytokine storm or ADE event and almost all of them died. The trials were deemed unsuccessful and were subsequently abandoned. We skipped this stage with the sars cov 2 quaxxine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quax companies have stated a 95% effectiveness claim. But this is an RRR relative risk reduction. Look it up and understand the difference between RRR and ARR actual risk reduction. The ARR for these quaxxines is around 1%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The notion that taking the shot is the only way to get back to normal is a logical fallacy. I suggest you look up logical fallacies so you can better understand when someone, such as a government or media is using a false dichotomy to represent reality.</p>

        <p>I don't want to debate about socialism, but are you serious that you believe many people cannot afford food? Housing is at least an issue I will acknowledge although <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOCvMJPPbC4">it is government, not capitalism, that causes that</a> and also while housing should be offered to everyone, not everyone should be entitled to live in California, most expensive place in the US to live due to the blue politicians its people keep electing.</p>
<p>But I lived on $40 a week for food last semester and it could have been probably half that if I wasn't so lazy and cooked more often. Food is dirt cheap.</p>

<li>Globalism. The elites don’t care about us peasants, they care about power. COVID is a great opportunity for governments to gain more power. The story of mankind is the story of tyrannical governments. Just because you’re alive today doesn’t mean governments are suddenly the ‘good guys’. The Nuremberg trials weren’t that long ago. </li>
</ol>
<p>As for world peace, you must think the elites don’t benefit from wars. Governments are a gang of thieves writ large. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The people telling us to get shots, government/media, makes tons of money from either campaign contributions or ad revenue from big pharma. These people have a vested interest in enriching the very people who pay them handsomely. That’s the first point.
Second point, if the COVID vaccine is so safe, why is it not FDA approved? Why have there been more deaths from COVID vaccines than all other vaccines combined in VAERS? 
Speaking of VAERS, studies show only 1% of adverse events are event reported. Third, I have the right to determine my own health. The Nuremberg trials set forth a code. I have the right to not participate in a trial. Read point 1 of the Nuremberg code. People who are agreeing to this ‘vaccine’ (by definition, it is not a vaccine but gene therapy) are agreeing to be test subjects in an ongoing experiment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your anecdotal story about how masks work are disinteresting. Do you have any actual studies that show masks work for COVID in a public setting? No, you don’t. Because none exist. There is zero evidence that masks do anything at all. It’s theatre. It’s all part of identifying those who dare resist government edicts. Dissenters can be easily identified, very similar to the gold star the Jews were forced to wear. People who are compliant want others to comply too to reaffirm their decision to capitulate to government mandates. Some of us actually read things other than what government teachers assign and have discovered that there is a plethora of information out there showing all the evils committed ‘for the greater good’. 
The road to serfdom is paved in good intended policy.</p>

        <p>Yes. The WHO operates in 191 countries. If all countries look to the WHO for guidance, then yes. All governments could be being lied to by WHO, and then unwittingly or wittingly lying to their people. It’s not really that hard to comprehend.</p>

        <p>u/bugaosuni somewhere above they said that they wore masks while interacting with people for the whole year and didn't get sick, then they got sick but wore a mask and continued interacting with people and didn't get anyone else sick.</p>
<p>That sounds like a perfectly normal story that someone might have had in 2019, while not wearing masks, and thought nothing of it.</p>

        <p>I'm sure most people on here are sick of posts like these, but I haven't seen one in a while, so I'll bite. </p>
<p>&rt; What makes it so that every government in the world is lying to you, meaning that world peace has been established because everyone is working together?</p>
<p>Governments are notoriously bad at doing anything properly. What makes you believe that <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7923981/Coronavirus-Disturbing-videos-claim-people-collapsing-Wuhan.html">China didn't just try to inspire fear through some now obviously propaganda videos</a>, everyone else ran with it at first, authoritarians realized that they could get emergency powers by declaring states of emergency, lots of people were easily convinced of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/americans-overestimate-hospitalization-covid-study">a danger that is much higher than it actually is</a> and so authoritarians could easily coast by keeping their new powers.</p>
<p>In addition, it has been highly profitable for many businesses to keep the pandemic going (eCommerce, Pharma, Big Tech) and those companies probably significantly influence government policies as well. In addition, very conveniently companies like Youtube and Facebook all just decided to start pushing for lockdowns and a new normal, but I'm sure its just coincidence that those policies have helped make them a lot of money over the last year.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why governments that may not work with each other might all converge on supporting policies, especially policies which increase their power and the power of the interests they serve (giant corporations).</p>
<p>&rt; What is the mindset behind not getting a covid shot? There is rarely any side effects, and the only reason there are any in the first place is because people want to get out of this ASAP.</p>
<p>I can think of probably 3 reasons that people don't want a Covid shot:</p>
<ol>
<li>They don't think they are as effective as claimed. I remember seeing a post on r/lockdownskepticism that said that the vaccines were actually much less effective than marketing numbers imply. I can't find the link and don't know if I believe this myself, but some people probably do.</li>
<li>Covid is not dangerous to young people. This is just an objective fact. The IFR is <a href="https://www.acsh.org/news/2020/11/18/covid-infection-fatality-rates-sex-and-age-15163">lower than 0.15% for people under 50 and lower than 0.003%</a> for 18 year old kids like me.</li>
<li>These vaccines have been rushed, meaning standard safety protocols have been ignored for the most part in order to get them out faster. I honestly think this is a good thing, for the people who are at risk from Covid-19. See (2). But that also means that the long-term effects of the vaccines are not well known or tested. I've heard people say that this is just flat out false. It is at least true that none of the Covid vaccines are approved by the FDA. You would probably not have called anyone who refused to take a vaccine not approved by the FDA a conspiracy theorist 2 years ago.</li>
<li>Refusal to accept that we should just put our heads down, stick our arms out, and graciously accept whatever aid the elites offer for us because they are the ones who decide whether we are allowed to live our lives or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also probably some fringe lunatics who think that the vaccines are an attempt by Bill Gates to get you to pay for Windows 10 on your new neuralink microchip. Idk. Why doesn't more discussions about this actually go over the above points though? I suspect that in a subreddit literally called NoNewNormal, point 4 above resonates with a lot of people here.</p>
<p>&rt; Specifically on masks, what makes you think that they aren't functional? I have firsthand cases of masks working, and as such anti mask mindset is particularly irritating to me.</p>
<p>The entire scientific consensus of research until around March 2020 is that cloth and surgical masks are not effective. <a href="https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/articles/year-2019/surgical-masks-virus-protection.html">N-95 masks have solid science behind them</a> but surgical masks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/ldmrtj/iowa_gov_reynolds_removes_restrictions_on/gmaogvs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">seemed to not help in surgeries</a> and cloth masks <a href="https://globalbiodefense.com/2015/04/28/cloth-masks-increase-infection-risk-for-healthcare-workers/">increase infection</a> and offer <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-birdflu-masks-idUSN0345320620070504">a false sense of security</a>.</p>
<p>Then you get a sudden reversal of The Science(TM) and I have not seen a lot of evidence to suggest a radical change in opinion (unfortunately back when masks first started being recommended I wasn't paying attention to media or what was going on and just went along with what everyone else did - which I suspect most other people did too). This comes with many other genius ideas, such as plexiglass to seperate people (<a href="https://www.wwltv.com/video/news/health/coronavirus/plexiglass-not-protective-against-covid/289-1fd73405-fe01-41a0-9c39-1713eedc33b1">bad "science"</a> that makes Covid spread worse), disinfection of surfaces (may have made sense when we didn't know what was going on but <a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/disinfecting-surfaces-covid/">is not helpful</a> and was <em>still</em> being done by my university a month ago), social distancing which was tauted to be the 'most important measure' but <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4?op=1">is not important</a> (I'll come back to this).</p>
<p>Essentially, a lot of stuff that is reported to be ScIeNtIfIcAlLy proven to help against Covid was actually just what <em>seemed</em> like it might work based on less than 10 seconds of thinking being taken as gospel. What does actually help against Covid spread?</p>
<ul>
<li>Being outside, because of UV light and also because it is much better ventilated.</li>
<li>Being physically healthy protects against severe symptoms</li>
</ul>
<p>What measures are taken to protect everyone from Covid? Lock down gyms, keep people indoors in their houses, and have everyone continue doing things that evidence has shown to be ineffective or almost ineffective, 'just in case'.</p>
<p>Also, I wanted to emphasize this point about social distancing being useless because it shows just how bad scientific research can be, and how blindly trusting it is not a good idea. This doesn't really fit anywhere but it was one of the most interesting things I have read about Covid and I think it is a crime that most people probably will never read it. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/">The 60-Year-Old Scientific Screwup that Helped Covid Kill</a>.</p>

We don’t know how rare the side effects are because proper trials haven’t been done. This isn’t just a new vaccine but a new type of vaccine and it has skipped the usual trial process.</p>
<p>Why take an experimental treatment for a disease which (in my age and weight category and having no other medical conditions) is statistically less dangerous for me than the flu and which may well be symptom free?</p>
<p>I would suggest old, I’ll and overweight people take it but for me I don’t see the point.</p>

Because people use them wrong. Also whether they work or not is irrelevant, compelling someone to cover their face is a gross abuse of power from a government which is supposed to protect our natural rights. </p>
<p>I used to say the masks worked (back when fauci said they didn’t) based on their efficiency in Japan and elsewhere but where I live people use them so poorly they may as well not bother.</p>

        <p>I spend a lot of time in a 9' x 9' office with two women who came down with it (we were all maskless during the weeks / days that led up to them both being out at the same time for 2 weeks) not a symptom 1 on me.  I've been on the front line of things since COVID started.  To date never caught it and I've been tested multiple times HOPING I had it (2 weeks off 65% pay) nope.  Can't catch it. I swear I can't catch a break LOL.</p>

        <p>Dude, no evidence leads to skepticism.  You said it yourself:  "Reddit is anonymous".  Anyone can make claims...... calling them "stories" instead in no way boosts your credibility.  Provide some data and then maybe we'll talk.</p>

        <p>Nah, we’ve done this so many times with all of you.  </p>
<p>As far as I’m concern, do what you want with your body, but don’t coerce me to do something with mine that I don’t want to or need to.</p>
