    <strong>Just remember, when resistance to this scamdemic was easiest last march, where were all these vaxxed people who care about freedom then?</strong>
    <p><p>It has been the government and the sheep holding us back all along. That is the reality, do not forget this chain of events. </p>
<p>When it was "two weeks to flatten the curve" and when it was "just a mask" for the "deadly and novel" flu, where were all these vaxxed freedom lovers then? </p>
<p>Apparently, it is the unvaxxed who are to blame for the restrictions now but when these same unvaxxed who have been resisting this from the start voiced their unwillingness to play pretend apocalypse last march, we were deemed "heartless, grandma killers". Now we are "variant factories". Now we are "holding back" all those who complied with arbitrary and baseless health measures.</p>
<p>How much longer will i have to wait until this virus kills me? I have not followed a single health measure, the same measures that we were told is what will save us, why am i still here? Why is everyone around me still alive? </p>
<p>Imagine getting tricked by a TV and a cast of diversity hires... LOL cope</p></p>

        <p>Iâ€™m not afraid of germs but I wash my hands diligently even before the pandemic and I leave my shoes outside of my home. I go to work and come home. Stop trying to blame shit on normal people. I want to live in peace before the water wars start.</p>
