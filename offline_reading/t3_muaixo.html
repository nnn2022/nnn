    <strong>Is The Fear Of Covid From a Lack of Spirituality?</strong>
    <p><p>In my own circle of acquantances the people whom are most afraid of covid share the following traits; </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>- has told me they do not believe in god and do not think there is an afterlife. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It makes sense why some people are so scared of covid, they think this is all they get. They have been so dehumanized by science that they really do not even know they have a soul. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I personally am not afraid of covid because I know I have a soul and I know I'm going somewhere great after this is over. I do not fear death like so many of these covid believers do. Nor do I welcome death, I just see it as a door that everyone has to open sooner or later.</p></p>
