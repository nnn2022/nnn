    <strong>Is anyone else staying home for Thanksgiving because of doomer families?</strong>
    <p><p>Thanksgiving is two days away, and it doesn’t feel like it at all.  My relatives that come in every year planned on coming in to celebrate in spite of the tyrannical orders, but my uncle developed symptoms on Saturday and tested positive for COVID yesterday.  So they are no longer coming in.  For the record, I probably am disagreeing with many people on this sub when I say that I wouldn’t want to be around someone who I knew for a fact had COVID and was sick.  I draw the line at assuming every single person has it, even though they have no symptoms and no positive test.  So, my uncle not coming in does make sense to me.</p>
<p>However, I contacted other family members in the area to see what they were doing, and none of them are planning anything at all.  My great-aunt is having her son and his family over, and while she didn’t specifically say she didn’t want me there, she said she was worried about me being around so many people at work and stuff like that.  She’s part of a more vulnerable group, so I get it.  And other family members like her, who are perfectly young and healthy, are not only not having anyone over, but they are vehemently insulting the people who have chosen to get together this year instead of locking themselves in their homes, terrified of the world around them.</p>
<p>What’s worse is the fact that I’m the only person among my group of friends who has nothing to do for Thanksgiving.  I shouldn’t say nothing-I will be spending the day with just my dad, but of course he cancelled meeting my cousin for a beer in the afternoon because he’s too scared to be at a bar.  We have dinner reservations at an indoor restaurant, but I guarantee he’s going to cancel because he said today, “We need to start being vigilant.  Young and healthy people are dropping dead like flies from this.”  Where?  I haven’t seen this.  But all my friends are talking about how their families are having tradition as usual, all the big and festive gatherings that are planned, and it honestly makes me sad.  This doesn’t even feel like the holidays because people are literally scared to death.  My young and healthy coworkers and family members have begun insulting my friend’s families for getting together, and they don’t even know them, and it’s honestly infuriating to me.  My family is still planning to come in for Christmas, but I anticipate them getting scared and backing out.  This year is honestly surreal to me.</p></p>
