    <strong>What to do since Reddit is actively trying to get rid of this community and it‚Äôs users?</strong>
    <p><p>Reddit is the last social media I have and as much as I justify using it, I don‚Äôt think I can anymore. My account got reported and I have one strike left before they take down my account for ‚Äúhate‚Äù. The post that was reported was a video/post still available on my account is a video of a Dr explaining the effects of vaccines. I have fell in love with this sub because I feel this place gets me and is so refreshing. However, I know that there are many post of people experiencing similar treatment. I am not cowering to the trolls and haters but have a hard time staying/supporting an app that is allowing it‚Äôs users to be tormented this way. There is no fucking way for me to refute the strike on my account and it blows my mind that this is an absolute Reddit‚Äôs way or no way viewpoint. I refuse to be silenced and support an app that forces compliance. </p>
<p>I just don‚Äôt know how to continue staying on a platform that clearly doesn‚Äôt want us here. Is there any place that those of us who want to jump ship can? I am tired of the censorship, the smear campaigns, and attacking of our rights to use free speech. Does anyone else feel similar? If so, what are y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts or perhaps solutions?</p></p>

        <p>Our days are numbered for sure. Reddit is my last social media as well, there's really no other place I can voice my opinions and speak relatively freely, and it pisses me off that so many brainwashed, weak people seek to take this away from us. This is the technocracy, total censorship.</p>

        <p>For awhile I tried to justify my use of it but I no longer can. They don‚Äôt want us here. I refuse to support this platform even if it‚Äôs our last place. It‚Äôs not fucking FAIR. I sound like a little kid who‚Äôs toy got stolen on the playground but I feel that way. I can‚Äôt believe this is the world we live in. Perhaps a server? I feel so hopeless but what kind of fight can we have if they make it to where we can‚Äôt even REFUTE heinous claims?</p>

        <p>&rt;Reddit is the last social media I have</p>
<p>Same. I deleted everything else. Too much sjw, virtue signaling and propaganda. It's like I can tell now what they are upto next. And seeing My friends on it getting brainwashed just like that, I had to delete it.</p>
<p>I've had many accounts on reddit, they all got banned for being too based. Got reported for petty things. If that happens to you, get a VPN and keep creating new ones. This is like my 10th account here. Loool.</p>

        <p>The solution is to find groups of real world humans and to ditch the internet. Let the Doomers and the bureaucrats take it. I don't even have a smartphone anymore. I definitely would get rid of my computer if grad school didn't require it.</p>
<p>We started going to religious services. We're barely religious, more like spiritual, but it's like one of the few groups of humans left. We do two on Sunday, Lutheran and Sikh. There are a few hobby guilds in town like spinners and weavers that we've joined as well.</p>
<p>Going back to books for education and entertainment has been so good for me. We got rid of all screens except this one, and I look forward to the day where I have to go to the library for internet access.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this response. I am in my early twenties and have grown up in an age where it is beyond normal. I think it is time to delete everything for good and do exactly as you say. This is not a way to live. </p>
<p>I‚Äôll definitely start going to church and get involved like you recommended. I definitely will be reading more and have been getting out in nature more than ever. Cheers to a somewhat normal life. I‚Äôm starting to consider going back to a very basic phone maybe a flip phone. Keep spreading the positivity and great advice!</p>

        <p>We are building a new community which will be located at <a href="https://nonewnormal.win">https://nonewnormal.win</a> </p>
<p>Our timelines on development have been completely shot, but once released this site will provide an all-in-one chat message board (discord/reddit) style community built from the ground up for this exact purpose.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the chat and message board will both feature a worldwide AND radius based local channel. This translates to being able to easily talk and meet fellow patriots in your area. </p>
<p>Spread the word and sign up for the newsletter... the more people we have at launch the more of a chance this will actually stick. </p>
<p>PS our site will be built progressive web app first so no need to worry about being removed from the app store...</p>

        <p>You can't do anything. If the commies want a subreddit shut down, it will be shut down - with or without reason. All you can to is migrate elsewhere or make a new sub.</p>
