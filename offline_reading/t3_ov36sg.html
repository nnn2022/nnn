    <strong>C19 Doctrine...</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like this is the new dogma... IDK how new of an idea this is but some like Truthstream Media have compared this new breed of science to a new religious dogma (and there's a similar parallel James Corbett pointed out with the C19 as the new 9/11 which is essentially outright blatant) and I agree but I'd like to expand on this a bit because it's fascinating how many fellow non-Christians might ridicule organized religion yet won't realize the Jungian shadow... that they're projecting and really falling for the same thing under a different guise. Yeah, there's the obvious comparisons of top government-approved scientists and a priest class... there's their underlings that follow everything they say and won't question it...</p>
<p>However, those scientists who have ANY nuance or suggest we might try ANY different alternatives to a rushed, novel vaccine are the new "witches" and their censorship is sort of the new "burning at the stake" and hell... they don't even need to be anti-vaxx, MAGA or say that it's bad FOR CERTAIN... however merely QUESTIONING it or saying we should've tried certain medicines in which we KNOW the safety of as a "well, at least we tried it even if it didn't work" is enough for people like DarkHorse Podcast to get demonetized by uTube. Why? Oh, probably because Orange Man (the new "Devil") said something about using HCQ. It's ironic hearing "let's follow the science" from these government-approved scientists... YES! LET'S DO SO BUT FOR REAL!</p>
<p>If you noticed, in the eyes of the media (MSNBC, CNN, and even "alternative" news like TYT etc. are the new evangelical channels) nothing people do to be "godly" is EVER "good enough." They shut down as much as possible which many people sacrifice their jobs for? NOT ENOUGH, it's the fault of those that won't stay home and celebrated St. Patty's and Spring Break instead. People wear masks all the time? NOT ENOUGH, it's those anti-mask protesters ruining it for the rest of em. The vaccine rolls out and tons of people get them without even reading the ingredients? NOT ENOUGH, not everyone will take them and it's THOSE anti-vaxxer's faults that there's the "Delta." Now people can start going back to work as "normal?" Nope, they gotta get EVERYONE vaxxed even though "essential workers" having been unvaccinated (not to mention even worse, underequipped medical staff) was just fine before the experimental vaccine even got its EUA. They ALWAYS focus on the negative by moving the goalposts constantly because THAT is one of the biggest ways the narrative can continue. It doesn't matter any hypocrisies such as Fauci backpedaling on masks (which merely SCRATCHES THE SURFACE of the scummy shit he's done, even to the point that the shitlibs who used to SING HIS PRAISES are starting to catch on) or Gates not releasing the patent for the vaccine so what they call the "global south" won't be getting a vaccine til like 2023 or so... and using THEIR logic maybe releasing the patent might've STOPPED a variant that started in a poor country (especially from Gates, who likes to masquerade as some benevolent philanthropist who cares SO MUCH about the suffering children in the developing world) but NOPE the priests gotta get their collection plate money aka BIG PHARMA GOTTA GET PAID!</p>
<p>In fact, actually C19-ism might be WORSE than a religion merely because of what is considered a SIN. All you have to do is NOT WEAR A MASK and go someplace without one when you're unvaccinated. The old sins of "drinking or doing drugs and premarital sex" have been replaced with the PETTIEST of things. Plus, if perchance on the VERY offchance that SOMEONE gets C19 from doing something like this they will do ANYTHING possible to "make an example" out of them so that they can JUSTIFY authoritarianism that would've been considered UNTHINKABLE 2 years ago. To them because right now I don't exactly trust the novel vaccine I'm a disgusting SINNER even though I don't drink anymore... or hell I won't mess with anything past CAFFEINE anymore. My own MOTHER who is someone intelligent and well-read in so many ways who once championed the book "The Culture of Fear" and even though she got vaxxed early on (which I understand as she's on the older side) she literally blamed ME for the indoor mask mandates returning and is STILL afraid of C19 from those unvaccinated as are damn near ALL the vaxxed people I know of... the vaccine that when it was first approved was championed as THE SAVIOR that would allegedly crush C19 dead in its tracks and make anyone who takes it immune!</p>
<p>Hell C19-ism has its own "do as thee, not as me" "hypocritical preachers" such as Gov. Newsom and the French Laundry incident but even worse (I mean it was shitty but Newsom DID apologize in some way) was Nancy Pelosi who went MASKLESS into a salon to get her hair done and when caught and called out on it she claimed she was SET UP! IIRC the backlash to the salon was so bad they had to shut down... all because Pelosi wouldn't own up to it. Even worse, I remember on FB some were DEFENDING IT! A friend of mine had the NERVE to say "I wouldn't care if she had a full spa day, SHE DESERVES IT!" YEAH, someone who would lose their SHIT if a conservative MAGA nutjob like MTG did the SAME THING! As bad as C19-ism is it is powerful enough to turn otherwise logical, thinking people into full-on SHITLIBS. It's truly tragic.</p>
<p>Actually, the parallels are so plenty I can go on all night... I'm not talking down on religion but on the extremism as how similar it is to what is happening now... plus being left-leaning myself it is outright bizarre that (as Corbett recently pointed out) these luddite far-lefties who used to CONDEMN the hell out of these mega-corporations with their corruption, pollution, animal-testing and such calling anyone who won't take their experimental jabs MORONS and BAD PEOPLE! "Clown World" just doesn't do what we have now justice anymore...</p></p>

        <p>The religion of "neoliberalism" - incubated by and propagated by aligned public and private institutions - has the distinct advantage, to the network that coordinates it, of being able to make anything virtuous or sinful based on its immediate needs. Wearing a mask can be a sin one month and virtuous the next. In order to follow this religion you have to have faith in it in order to rationalize its contradictions to yourself and others. If one is faithful one won't, for example, draw to much attention to the world hunger, <a href="https://www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/20th-anniversary-campaign/covid-related%20hunger-could-kill-more-people-than-the-virus">estimated to be killing millions</a>, that's been generated by the economic disruption that lockdowns, etc. have caused.</p>

        <p>Brother I understand you completely. It’s a very strange feeling as a left-leaning individual to watch liberals turn into fascists in real time and lefties bragging about which Pharma company shot them up. But remember it’s not all doom and gloom and we need to focus on that. Millions of us are regaining consciousness everyday. You are not alone. But we need a lot of love and faith to get through this. We even need to pray for our “enemies” as hard as that is.</p>

        <p>I had a similar thought recently: Covid is now part of the official ideology of the west, in the same that LGBTQ+ rights are. It is really that insane.</p>
