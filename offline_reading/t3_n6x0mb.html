    <strong>Life as a Young Lockdown Skeptic-the Isolation, the Anger, the Depression-My Story</strong>
    <p><p>This will be a LONG post.  There’s a ton going on in my life, and almost none of it would be happening right now if it weren’t due to the lockdowns and new normal insanity.  In fact, I am currently in a rural red state, displaced to here in an attempt to escape the new normal supporting cesspool that was California, but I’ll go into that later.</p>
<p>Before I go into the intricacies of the big (really big?) issues in my life currently, I would like to provide you guys with a picture of what my life was like pre-new normal/pre-lockdown (off-topic but I just remembered an online question being asked about what the “BC to AD event” in your life was, and I just now realized that it for me unquestionably was the start of the lockdown, and I can say that confidently even though I am only barely 20 years old-they have changed me that much, and I know they will more than anything else in the future).</p>
<p>Before I start this long spiel, I’d like to give a few basic facts about me: I’m a 20 year old guy (born early 2001) who’s a hardcore lockdown skeptic (obviously).  I’m a very analytical and overwhelmingly logical thinker, and can find a flaw or inconsistency in a person’s logic almost immediately, and I possess a very, very large amount of skepticism (this analytical mindset combined with my skeptical nature made me a lockdown skeptic from the very first day the lockdown was introduced).  I’ve got a pretty awkward, shy, quiet, nerdy personality, but my awkwardness and shyness has definitely decreased due to lockdown as the overwhelming amount of lockdown/new normal support in my area has made me into a much more confrontational person than prior.  I’m still not at Chris Sky levels, but I now can call people out on their BS with lockdown/new normal type stuff.  Myers-briggs is INTP if you’re wondering.  Also, if race is at all important to you, I’m not white at all, and nobody mentioned in this story is white, even when I mention something like “extended social group”, not a single one.  I say this only to avert claims of my lockdown skepticism being based on “white supremacy” or “white nationalism” or something else nonsensical like that.</p>
<p>So... pre-lockdown me.  Where to begin?  To avoid this already long post from being clogged with unnecessary details, I’ll put in just what’ll be important for the future parts of the post when I discuss how lockdown really affected me.  </p>
<p>I was born and raised in California, and lived there for the first 20 years of my life (only a few days ago did I move out for a bit).  California and its inhabitants have a notorious reputation for being very conformist and leftist, both of which I can attest are true.  I always felt like an outlier being staunchly libertarian rather than leftist and skeptical rather than conformist, but I was always able to have community and close relationships with even the most conformist of people I knew, because I was able to put aside our differences and simply have a good time socially interacting with them.  </p>
<p>Starting from age 6, I was exposed to pornography and developed an extreme addiction and dependence upon it several years later.  This will become extremely relevant later on, but I mention it now just to show how deep-rooted the problem with pornography and sex obsession is, it started in my young childhood.</p>
<p>At age 14 right before entering high school, I became a Born-Again Christian and gave my life to Jesus Christ.  About 3 years later I began to get very involved with church and Christian fellowships.  Almost every church event and meeting, I was involved.  I can not under-emphasize just how much Church and Christian fellowship was a part of my life.  I was not a typical sunday-goer.  I was going multiple times a week, sometimes even every day and church and Christian fellowships were virtually my ENTIRE social structure from junior year of high school to freshman year of college (around 2017-2020).  I mention this not to boast or say how righteous I was (I literally just mentioned in the prior paragraph I was and still have a problem with sex obsession and pornography), but to show just HOW much I was involved in Christian social circles.  Over political circles or friends met elsewhere, overwhelmingly my social group was made up of church.  I relied on this social group for, quite literally, everything. I told many of these people the deepest, darkest struggles in my life, and grew as close to these people as my own family.  Put it simply, church and Christian groups were friends of the highest order, with many of them being people I was as close to as family.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, I am in general extremely logical and skeptical in my thinking process.  This led me to great academic success, often without too much effort if any at all.  I received a 1550 SAT as well as a GPA well near 4.0 unweighted and well above 4.0 weighted.  I got into UCLA and attended, doing well academically there even with poor study habits.  School was never a challenge for me, and this continued into college as well.  Academics has always been my strong suit simply due to my logical and critical thinking processes.  I say this not to boast, but because this will become very relevant when I discuss the problems created in my life due to lockdown.</p>
<p>Prior to lockdown, I was an extremely immature man-child.  Even halfway to 3/4 of the way in, I was very, very immature.  I still am to some degree, but I can say with confidence that I am infinitely more mature now than in March 2020, though I may be in a worse and more hopeless mental state, I am unquestionably more mature.  I say this because prior to lockdowns, I was simply obsessed with girls and getting a girlfriend, sex, all that stuff.  Because I was shy, it usually never actually materialized into anything so I generally just “simped” over girls as embarrassing as that is to say now lmao.  But that’s the best way to describe it, I was simply obsessed with women and made relationships my highest priority in life and was the biggest “simp” imaginable from late high school to early college.  My brain naturally fixates and obsesses on something, making it almost my life’s purpose, and it happened to be relationships during this time period of my life.  This is very embarrassing to admit, but I say this just to emphasize how different of a person I was prior to the lockdowns starting.  This relationship obsession is not the case with me anymore at all, due to me being totally obsessed with lockdowns and related new-normal policies (mask mandates, vaccine passports, etc.).  I will go into that a bit more later in this post.  </p>
<p>With all that said, I think I can now delve into my life problems created by both myself and lockdowns since March 2020.</p>
<p>I think the best way to approach this is through a general timeline of what happened chronologically, as opposed to giving an outline of how each area of my life was affected, so I’ll start going chronologically.</p>
<p>Ah, January and February of 2020.  I remember seeing the funny joke memes about the virus, and getting a bit jokingly scared with my university friends (keep in mind almost all from Christian fellowship) when the first case in UC Berkeley was confirmed.  At this time, I was a bit curious about the virus and how dangerous it actually was, so I did a quick google search (keep in mind this was in January/February of 2020, before the entire west decided to destroy all of individual liberty by undertaking a lockdown), I quickly found a very mainstream news source (I believe it was MSNBC) stating that the virus was not a big deal at all unless you were very old or had prior health conditions.  So, I immediately knew there was no cause for worry of this virus.  </p>
<p>March 2020.  This was when I really started to get a bit disconnected with what the world around me was starting to do.  When UCLA implemented social distancing and sanitizing measures, I was immediately skeptical as to whether this was all... necessary?  The disease was no big deal according to a mainstream source in January/February, and I couldn’t really find a single source claiming something to the contrary PRIOR to March of 2020 (in actuality, Italy’s first lockdown was the real domino which completely changed how everybody in the west viewed the virus and lockdowns).  I also remembered living through the 2009 Swine Flu Pandemic as a child which also had a high a very high amount of panic among the general populace, though with absolutely no lockdowns or “safety measures”.  My basic thought process was this disease was not that deadly according to freaking MSNBC just a month ago and we didn’t do ANY of this theater during a 2009 pandemic, so is any of this really...necessary?  I recall having some disagreements over how dangerous the disease was and how necessary the supposed “safety measures” were with a lot of my friends (keep in mind all from Christian circles).</p>
<p>I was very distraught when my university announced that the final quarter of the school year would be online, but I assumed that the school would be back to complete and total normalcy in Fall of 2020.  Oh how naïve I was. However, I was actually far, far more angry at Governor Newsom’s stay-at-home order as I immediately saw it as an unconstitutional, authoritarian overreach of power which was completely unnecessary to undertake for a disease this minor.  I voiced my angry concerns to some of my friends as well as r/Libertarian, and I think you can guess that a grand total of zero of them were sympathetic towards my viewpoints.  I had one friend from high school who was a very mild skeptic whom I vented to a lot in early lockdown, but that was the closest I got to a total lockdown skeptic friend.</p>
<p>I will divide lockdown into three phases.  Since we have been in lockdown a little over a year, I will call the first third of lockdown, or the first 3-4ish months, “Phase One” of lockdown, I’ll call the second set of the 3-4ish months “Phase Two”, and the last set of 3-4ish months “Phase Three”, with a “Phase Four” at the very end which includes today.  So, here we go:</p>
<p>PHASE ONE:</p>
<p>I thought it would only be a few weeks or a few months of draconian government overreach, and I was quite certain that full, total normalcy would resume after just a few weeks or months.  I hung out with my university friends (should be read as: Christian group/Church) a LOT, though it was all done online, mainly through Zoom.  In real life, I mainly hung out with my very mild skeptic friend who I mentioned above, but I mean he was a very, very mild skeptic.  He still supported lockdowns, but simply thought that there was a bit too much panic over the disease.  I’ll call this friend “Mild”, for mild skeptic.  I additionally began to hang out with one of my old friends from high school, and I slowly began to discuss some of my libertarian viewpoints on socialism, authoritarianism, and other issues not relating to lockdown with him.  Prior to lockdown, he was actually a self-avowed leftist/socialist who supported Bernie Sanders, so I was actually very surprised at how receptive he was to my long ramblings on why socialism is inherently evil and inevitably leads to authoritarianism.  I mention this friend because (spoiler) as you’ve probably guessed, this open-minded friend will in the future (past Phase One) become a HARDCORE lockdown skeptic due to my influence and get me through a LOT of hard times. Seriously, I wouldn’t be here today without this friend.  Let’s call this friend “Keeper”, just for how good of a friend he was throughout this.  So that was my main social situation throughout Phase One of lockdowns: social situation entirely the same except online rather than IRL, and the only IRL friends I hung out with were “Mild” and “Keeper”, whom I mentioned above.  Also, for those unaware, I was living with my family at this time.</p>
<p>The first quarter of online school, I had to drop two of my three classes last minute due to me simply not having the work ethic or motivation to learn high-level math courses online, and I would have failed those classes had I not dropped.  During this first phase of lockdown, my general outlook on life, as well as my life in general, had not changed all too much.  Sure, I was stuck at home all day, generally not going out unless it was with the same few friends from high school, but I was still the same simpy and immature man-child who fantasized about relationships and sex the entire day.  In addition, I was still hanging out with church group as MUCH as I could during this time, though it was entirely virtual, as I mentioned above.  I disagreed with them on lockdowns, but was certain that these lockdowns were very temporary that I didn’t hang out with them less because of our disagreements.</p>
<p>A bit of a side point is that during Phase One and early -mid Phase Two I was dealing with horrible OCD.  I have had symptoms of OCD my whole life with certain periods of it getting worse and getting better, and the OCD began to flare up very, very badly even prior to lockdowns.  During the first 5 months or so of lockdowns, my OCD was horrible, and made MUCH worse by me being forced to stay inside all day by the government and having NOTHING else to do but ruminate on my own thoughts.  My pornography addiction also got a good amount worse with me being trapped inside the entire day.</p>
<p>If my original fantasy of thinking full normalcy would be back by Fall of 2020 did actually come true, then I would have remained the same simpy and immature man-child obsessed with relationships and sex, and with the exact same social circle.  The 2020 Lockdowns in this alternate world would have been an interesting point of discussion with my church group and Christian fellowship friends; they all almost universally would disagree with me on it, but since it would not be super relevant in this alternate world, I would simply be able to have fun friendly debates with my Christian circle over this.  However, we all know by now that full normalcy indeed did not return.  My outlook on life, as well as social circle, maturity level, and other things were largely unchanged during “Phase 1” of lockdown.  That began to change in Phase 2.</p>
<p>PHASE TWO:</p>
<p>I would mark Phase Two of lockdown as beginning around the time of the massive BLM protests beginning in June 2020 following the death of George Floyd, and lasting around 4-5ish months.  This Phase was a large “transition period” in my life, and you will see what I mean when you finish reading Phase Three.  I use the BLM protests as a marking point because it was when I began to get disconnected with my established social circle.  Though it is outside the scope of this subreddit, I will mention now that I opposed the BLM protests and the BLM movement, and I only mention this because my entire established social circle, from family, church/Christian fellowship, as well as my mild skeptic friend “Mild” mentioned above (Note: not all supported rioting, I simply mean to say they almost all universally supported the BLM movement).  So, as you would imagine, I am now constantly hearing about systemic racism and how the church and Christians need to fight it, and this is beginning to draw a rift between me and my heavily established social circle of Christian group.  I recall the first time I left a church Zoom meeting early due to a member saying she was somewhat sympathetic towards rioting.  I was so disgusted.  I am not going to go into a detailed analysis of why I disagree with the BLM movement, and if you have a different viewpoint on it that is perfectly fine I won’t argue with you, I’m just mentioning all of this BLM stuff to show and demonstrate one thing: a noticeable rift was beginning to be created between my established social circle of years (Church/Christian Fellowship) and myself.  I still remained close with “Mild” as he was only mildly sympathetic to the movement and strongly opposed rioting, and we had been friends since Kindergarten (Unrelated side note, but nowadays I won’t be bothered too much by one’s viewpoint on the BLM movement since I now care much, MUCH more about lockdowns and New Normal than my views on BLM, and I would not react as strongly as I did back during this time if one supported it.  I now can largely ignore one’s view on it for the most part.  If you are a lockdown skeptic reading this and support BLM, I would not get mad at you or debate you if I interacted with you at all, as I am now far more focused and bothered by the issue of lockdowns and related new normal policies.  Again, I say that I only mention BLM to show that it drove a sizable rift between me and my established social circle, not for any other reason as it is largely outside the scope of this subreddit.).</p>
<p>So, my established social circle was beginning to show some cracks.  BLM was what started to draw the rift between me and my social circle, but lockdowns made this rift much stronger during these months.  I began to grow very, very impatient during this phase with regards to the end of lockdowns.  It was during this phase that I finally discovered some online subreddits with people who thought lockdown was insane and morally wrong, namely r/Anarcho_Capitalism and r/GoldAndBlack.  However, a major point during this Phase came when I discovered the subreddit r/LockdownSkepticism, as I went from Skeptic to HARDCORE skeptic.  All of the simply OVERWHELMING evidence against lockdowns presented on the page convinced me that EVERY single restriction during this time was total nonsense and security theater, as well as EXTREMELY damaging to society.  It was also at this point that I discovered r/NoNewNormal and r/CoronavirusCircleJerk.  At this point, I started to become seriously depressed and suicidal, now not from OCD, which began to go away, but due directly to Lockdown and related New Normal policies.  </p>
<p>My OCD got so bad during the first half of Phase Two, certainly not helped by lockdown, that I nearly had a suicide attempt due to it.  One of my closest friends from church helped me after I almost attempted, helping me calm down and not get so anxious over my irrational obsessions. However, my OCD began to fade away pretty quickly when I became extremely obsessed with lockdowns in the second half/near the end of Phase Two.  I think that the constant rumination over how horrible lockdowns and new normal policy were simply taking up all of my brain’s capacity for obsession.</p>
<p>Socially, as mentioned before a rift that was sizable was certainly created and growing.  A major turning point was when I shared my dire frustrations and sorrow over what Lockdowns did to my life and how they influenced me to almost commit suicide (by making my OCD worse) to the same church friend who consoled me after my near suicide-attempt.  This was a major turning point because he responded immediately by stating how much he disagreed with my position on lockdowns, not immediately at least sympathizing that lockdown was indeed hard (even if he did support the insanity).  The poor response that my friend had to my lockdown woes began to make an even larger rift between me and my formerly established social circle.  But even aside from that one event, seeing NEARLY EVERY single person you were close to, and in some cases even considered family ALL almost UNIVERSALLY support Lockdowns, support keeping their churches closed, SUPPORTING the Canadian Pastor being jailed, SUPPORTING LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE DRACONIAN GOVERNMENT ACTION, when you see your entire social circle that you had relied on during this time (in my case, Church/Christian Group) all unanimously eat up the lockdown narrative and talk about how much they support mask mandates and lockdowns during meetings, it simply drives such a MASSIVE rift between you and them when you KNOW that all of this insanity is UNNECESSARY BULLSHIT.  Phase Two was when I began to slowly distance myself from my social circle which I had relied on for YEARS for sanity.  I had rarely felt seriously suicidal since getting involved with church and Christian community because I could always tell them my deepest, darkest struggles and they would help me through it.  And now here I was, with one of the biggest struggles in my life, that being Lockdown, and I can’t tell them about it because they would NOT sympathize with me this time around.  As you can probably predict, this complete social isolation by the people I had completely relied on the last few years let to much more near suicide attempts, but I’ll cover those in Phase Three.  And you probably predicted it, but my porn addiction began to skyrocket during this time, as I was starting to feel extremely, extremely isolated.</p>
<p>As to my friends I was seeing in real life during this phase, my friend “Mild” moved away for College, even though it was still online.  My friend “Keeper” began to get very, very close with me, and I shared more of my Libertarian viewpoints with him, including on lockdowns.  I was extremely surprised at how receptive he was to my good arguments and how well-convinced he became when presented with new evidence.  We both agreed on how much we hated lockdowns, and it was at this point that I actually planned on moving to an open state (South Dakota) with this friend.  “Keeper” quickly became the closest friend in my life following this.  </p>
<p>School-wise, I decided to take community college transferrable classes and declare non-attendance for one quarter at my university in order to save money.  I aced both of the classes as they were easy for me, though it took much nagging from parents to be able to do any of the required work.</p>
<p>Mindset and maturity-wise, I was definitely in a transition phase.  I was now mainly thinking about and getting stressed and obsessed over lockdown rather than relationships, but I was fantasizing that having an anti-lockdown girlfriend and sex with her would help me through this a lot.  It was definitely a transitional mindset.</p>
<p>Phase Two brought many changes, and Phase Three would truly show how changed my life would end up due to Lockdowns.</p>
<p>PHASE THREE:</p>
<p>Phase Three I would mark as beginning with me nearly having a suicide attempt explicitly due to lockdown policy, not OCD.  I would soon have many more of these as well.  I would say this phase lasted about 4-5 months.  </p>
<p>During this phase, “Keeper” and I hung out nearly every day, and we vented all of our lockdown frustrations to each other, and became very, very close friends because of it.  To this day, I consider him a brother, and I don’t think anything will ever change that.  We have bonded so much and I think that bond will last until death.</p>
<p>As mentioned prior, I nearly had multiple suicide attempts due explicitly to lockdown, as well as the complete social isolation due to the rift created between me and my entire Christian social group.  I believe I should clarify what I mean when I say “nearly committed suicide”; in every one of these instances, I held scissors or a knife in my hand, near my neck and strongly, STRONGLY considered slicing my neck and letting the blood flow out to kill myself.  This occurred I would estimate around 5 times during Phase Three.  Had it not been for “Keeper”, it is highly likely I would have successfully killed myself.</p>
<p>In Phase 3, social isolation from my prior close group of Church only began to increase with every passing day.  This was especially the case when the vaccine was introduced, 1/3-1/2 of the way into Phase Three.  At first, I was simply not interested and was not going to harass and talk bad of others who chose to get it.  Sure, it might be an objectively nonsensical decision to take a 6 month old mRNA injection for a disease which poses absolutely zero risk to virtually every single person of healthy weight under the age of 40 (a point which virtually every sane epidemiologist admits-Martin Kulldorff’s famous quote of “believing that everybody should get vaccinated is as scientific as believing that nobody should”), but as long as they leave me alone I could leave them alone.  Nope.  Constant bragging about getting the jab, as well as extreme anger and hostility towards those who expressed any hesitation and who were in any way the slightest bit skeptical of getting the jab.  I ignored this at first and likely would have just kept ignoring it had it not been for one thing which almost completely ended and completely fractured my relationships with all my former Christian friends: the Vaccine Passport.  </p>
<p>Vaccine Passports are so draconian and so outright evil and dystopian, that when I first heard of plans of them to be introduced in New York, I unironically nearly had a complete mental breakdown on the spot.  The news about vaccine passports made me legitimately pay far less attention to lockdowns and mask mandate news, as the satanic tools known as vaccine passports now had a serious possibility of actually coming to fruition.  Vaccine Passports were the most brazenly evil, horrific, unjust moral atrocity I have ever witnessed in the west firsthand in terms of the sheer proposed scale and pure evil of what was being proposed.  I view mandatory vaccinations as very nearly morally equivalent to rape, and mandatory vaccinations are almost identical to vaccine passports.  The fact that absolutely NO church leader spoke out against this and that NONE of the friends in my Christian circle spoke out against it (in fact I KNOW that most of them outright support it and still do today) completely sealed the deal in terms of essentially completely losing a social circle.  When I say this, I don’t mean that I am done with all churches everywhere or with my faith, simply that I lost my entire Christian social circle present at my hometown.<br>
But I truly understand what it must have felt like to have been a Christian living in 1930s Germany concerned about the Nazis when nearly all but a few of the German churches turn a blind eye to the Nazi actions-as happened historically.  I could accept the argument that lockdowns aren’t as bad as anything the Nazis did, but that argument completely falls apart once Vaccine Passports are being discussed.  Vaccine Passports are equivalent to the Nazis mandating that every Jew wear a yellow star-it is such a horrific and brazen violation of civil liberties and there is no way around it.  This position of mine was only solidified when I checked out my woke LA church’s message and it was more concerned about systemic racism than literal horrific tyranny right on our doorstep.  I wasn’t even angry anymore, I just laughed, I was and am that done with this social group.  </p>
<p>So, my social group I had relied on for the past few years of my life is entirely gone, leading to multiple suicide attempts, what about other stuff in my life?  Porn?  Well, as you could probably guess the porn usage skyrocketed to unimaginable levels as I was feeling so incredibly lonely and isolated from the loss of the social group I had completely relied on so much the past few years.  The type of porn also escalated, eventually leading to having me waste hundreds of dollars on OnlyFans just to feel a little bit less isolated during this horrific time.  I was about to hook up and lose my virginity with a girl from the site before my friend “Mild” came to the rescue and invited me to visit him at his college instead of hook up with her.  This was a great move on his part as it would have been a massive mistake on my part to do that.</p>
<p>My mindset, as you could tell, is now almost entirely focused on just lockdowns and not relationships at all.  Lockdowns and related policies became my new obsession, and what I literally thought about constantly.  Ironically, because I cared about relationships so much less and placed so much less importance on it and stopped obsessing over it, I had a large increase in confidence and began to casually flirt a little bit with female coworkers and friends.  In fact, I actually ended up getting into a relationship with an anti-lockdown girl I met online only a few months ago.  She lives far away, but it is very nice having somebody you can vent to about all of this who you are romantically attracted to.</p>
<p>“Keeper” and his friend, another hardcore skeptic who I became friends with as well during this time, were both planning on moving with me to South Dakota.  I ended up getting a job to save money for it, but in the end a few months later, they said they were not ready and wanted to stay in California.  I was not angry at all, but a bit sad.  I still was determined to move by myself, and began making the arrangements to do so.</p>
<p>Oh, and school?  I saved that for last in Phase 3, because it is quite literally the biggest long-term problem I have in my life right now.  After my community college venture, I had to do one quarter (online obviously) at UCLA where I took one class and got a D.  It was a very easy class too.  I got a D because I had absolutely no motivation to do any of the homework assignments (which alone took up almost half of my grade) or do any work whatsoever in the class.  Had I put in 5 minutes a day on the class, I unquestionably would have aced the class.  I put in zero, as I was so obsessed with lockdowns and how the world was just going absolutely insane and how everybody was SUPPORTING the governments doing so, especially once vaccine passports were announced, I literally just did not care anymore-the news of those alone made me want to kill myself.</p>
<p>So what’s the big problem with school you ask?  Well, it’s because the UC’s have said that they will mandate the Covid vaccine once it becomes fully FDA Approved (not EUA), which could happen in 5 years or (god forbid) 5 months.  If it’s the latter, and I can’t get a religious/medical/philosophical exemption, then I’m either going to have to transfer schools or drop out of college.  Under absolutely ZERO circumstances am I caving to the demands and getting injected with the vaccine.  This is a stance I am willing to die upon.  This would not be so much of an issue if I had a supportive family who respected my bodily autonomy, but my father is an establishment doctor who supports every single lockdown, mask mandate, and draconian government overreach-almost guaranteed he supports vaccine passports too.  To him, being skeptical of the safety of the covid vaccine is as crazy as believing the Earth is flat.  He thinks there is absolutely zero difference in risk between the covid vaccine and the meningitis vaccine (absolute insanity given that the latter vaccine functions by weakened/dead virus plus immune system adjuvant and these types of vaccines have been studied for nearly a century, whereas the former vaccine functions by mRNA biotech which has never been implemented on this large of a scale, with very questionable and sketchy issues regarding long-term effects, at the very least it is not necessary at all for somebody my age to get it which absolutely every single sane epidemiologist such as the aforementioned Martin Kulldorff does agree with).  </p>
<p>My dad has threatened to cut off all financial support from me permanently if I don’t go to UCLA Fall 2021 due to mandatory vaccination policy, as to him he’d think I’m literally more insane than a flat-earther if I refuse to go to my uni because of this.  I would do a transfer to University of Florida in a heartbeat as it is a fantastic school in a state where mandating covid vaccines for university is explicitly illegal. However, there are two main issues with this.  </p>
<p>The first one is that my father has absolutely zero-tolerance and has explicitly stated that if I don’t go back THIS fall to university, he will cut off ALL financial support for me and leave me completely on my own (as in no more health/auto insurance, phone bill, and likely even not paying for college if I do go in the future).  I don’t know if he would have the tolerance to wait one more year for me to transfer to U of Fl, when in his mind I am already the black sheep of the family for being the ONLY person in the entire extended family who doesn’t want the jab (I didn’t even mention how this lockdown/new normal isolated me from my entire extended family, I only mentioned my church group since I almost always found common ground with them in Jesus Christ and much of my extended family is non-Christian).  </p>
<p>The second issue is my one D as mentioned before.  University of Florida is a great school but I would likely easily be able to transfer if I got an A on the class I took last quarter.  I could retake it and get the grade replaced, but if UCLA mandates the vaccine before fall of 2021, then I’m screwed, as I can’t retake the class at all in UCLA.</p>
<p>And I know college is not necessary in today’s day and age especially with great trade school professions like plumber, electrician, carpenter, etc.  However, if you’ve read this far, you’ve probably picked up that I’m not a very “hands-on” kind of person and much prefer intellectual and academic environments where I can let my mind run wild with logical thoughts and possibilities.  In other words, college is indeed useless for the vast majority of kids who do go.  I am not in that vast majority as I have a specific personality type that prefers a logical/educational(and I mean educational in a traditional classroom learning sense, I am a Mathematics major and love the logical thinking I have to do for it) job as opposed to a hands-on one.</p>
<p>And for those of you who are already gonna DM me or comment the unthinkable, let me lay it out for you right here, plain and simple, buddy: I AM NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TAKING THE COVID VACCINE.  PERIOD.  I AM DYING BEFORE I GET INJECTED WITH IT.  IF YOU SUGGEST I DO THIS, THEN YOU CAN FUCK OFF.  THANK YOU.</p>
<p>Phase 4?:</p>
<p>I managed to put the pieces in order for a temporary move to South Dakota, where I am right now, but the future is still incredibly uncertain college-wise, which is by far the biggest problem long-term.  Short-term, I just moved here, so it is very lonely and isolating being in a new place halfway across the country knowing nobody.  I especially miss “Keeper” and his friend, both of whom I was supposed to move with. I have not abandoned my faith in God at all and will remain a Christian until I die, no matter what hardships may come,  I am going to try and find a church in my local area that does not care about the security theater nonsense, but that is not extremely easy even in this state.  Definitely doable and easier than in California, but not the easiest thing in the world.  </p>
<p>So, I guess that’s where I’m at right now.  This is quite literally the most comprehensive analysis on every single thing in my life that went awry due to lockdowns, and the main problems in my life right now.  If you made it all the way to this, then seriously thank you for reading. This took me about 4.5 hours to write-not joking.  God bless you all guys.</p></p>

        <p>First, yes I did read this entire thing.</p>
<p>My university has mandated the vaccine for all students living in on-campus housing. I live in an apartment close to campus, and am exempt. But it's looking like masking and social distancing will stay. And if I pass my quals this May, I'll be a doctoral candidate, and it's likely I'll be able to get out of my current state (blue state with dumb lockdowns, won't say where) and relocate to Texas or Florida for the upcoming academic year. My supervisor has a lot of responsibilities beyond our research group and expects grad students to take ownership of our projects, so I think he would trust my judgment and be cool with this as long as I pass my quals.</p>
<p>Translation: I get you. Keep nourishing your Christian faith, no matter what comes.</p>

        <p>I would save this somewhere where you could look back on it. It's very difficult right now to find a church whose mission doesn't involve violating international law. The conservative churches want to build the 3rd temple and the liberal ones see complying with health decrees as 'loving your neighbor as yourself'. Never mind that terrain theory has a million times the compassion and sense than germ theory. Keep off the porn, it'll be hard to do in SD. Those mfers have RBF above all others. Great faces my ass.</p>

        <p>wow. you really went through a lot and didn't really have many people by your side. most people wouldn't have made it through that situation. my immediate family seem to be pretty ok with everything going on which is disheartening. </p>
<p>sydney has reinstated a mask mandate in shopping centres which started at 5pm on thursday. because 2 people tested positive. the absurdity of it befounds me. i was able to go shopping without a mask 24 hours ago but now i have to wear a mask? makes no sense. and we were driving past shops and people weren't wearing masks and they considered reporting them to the authorities. i mentioned hiding jews under the floorboards as that seems like a fair comparison. and they dismissed it. </p>
<p>beginning of last year, i was fine with the lockdowns, because my friends were busy with uni and i had deferred because i was struggling with the online learning. and it comes back to the lack of accountability. i was ok with being locked inside because i didn't want to do anything else. </p>
<p>and then when the lockdowns lifted i spent a lot of time with my christian friends and what we talked about, the values they had, i developed similar views. and so i became more conservative and i was watching matt walsh and steven crowder and other conservative channels that helped form my opinions. </p>
<p>i discuss politics often with my dad and my brother and my views come across as incredibly baseless, and i think if i had some more information that i would be able to at least explain why i have my beliefs. im very focused in american politics because i think the best and worst of politicians can be seen in american politicians. </p>
<p>plus there really isn't a conservative party in australia so i don't really align with a party. my brother makes fun of me for being a 'republican', and i've explained to him that doesn't make sense. a vaccine passport hasn't become a thing in australia as of yet so i havent had to talk to them about that. my dad is really science focused and again i just need some facts that would demonstrate that lockdowns, masks and the vaccine dont work. i could just exclaim that they are a hindrance to their human rights but it would be futile. </p>
<p>i too also struggle with pornography and it's a really difficult thing to control. it seems that anything can trigger a 'temptation', you could call it. in my final 2 years of school i really wanted to develop sexual relationships and because of my school it wasn't easy. and then for the past few months i have been really fawning over the idea of a romantic relationship. </p>
<p>i would love to discuss anything i guess, help formulate my opinions so they aren't 'baseless'.</p>

        <p>I'm with u brother.
I'm from Chile, 34 yo male.
I was going to medical school when the "pandemic" started. I dropped out because I was losing my mind seeing how people, other students and teachers fell for the trap.
I then damaged my shoulder and haven't recovered in months, but I have to say it's been a blessing because it forced me to stop and reevaluate my life.
I would first tell you that you are very young. I know it feels overwhelming, but you are the creator of your reality by choosing your reactions.
Take control of your mind first. You must shake the fears off in order to truly live. 
Don't box yourself thinking you can't do something, we are always changing.
Please see this, you are divine and very powerful. You don't need your father or your family's support. You will find people, Friends, lovers, teachers.
Your sexuality is powerful and sacred, don't be ashamed and experiment with it with respect and wisdom.
Everything in this Universe is about frequency and energy. Elevate yourself and your entire world will change. Elevate your selfimage, you are divine, you are always safe.
I hope you find this useful.
A mantra I like : I am not the body, I am not even the mind.
Much love.</p>

        <p>Hi.  I don’t think you and I would agree on very many things (except perhaps the awesome power of God), and you probably wouldn’t even like me very much, but that’s okay.  I’m a parent, and I suspect your dad means nothing but good for you, even if it appears he’s being harsh.  More importantly, you’re clearly depressed and need to speak with a mental health professional - probably not a church-affiliated one.  I don’t know what part of SD you’re in, so it may be tough to find one, but there are lots of online options now.</p>
<p>This isn’t meant to be cruel or snarky in any way.  Unlike so many postings here, I can tell your pain is real.  There’s a way out of it, I promise.</p>

        <p>I don't care if you get a vaccine or not. Darwinism works just fine for me. But FORGING vaccination papers is truly reprehensible. I hope you get caught and imprisoned for it. The only downside of that scenario for the rest of us is that then you would actually be protected by being in a population with herd immunity. FFS</p>

        <p>Oh, I thought you had forged it for her to use. Do what you want for yourself, ya selfish narcissist. But if you won't get vaccinated I do hope you catch Covid. I hope you don't have horrible symptoms or die, but that would put us one person closer to herd immunity. Although it's also one more chance for the virus to mutate and become more lethal.

I specifically said I hope your stupidity DOESN'T result in your death or horrible illness. It's also not a "forced medical procedure."</p>

        <p>No deaths in my family. 1 hospitalization that wasn't so serious - just needed resdimisvir and oxygen monitoring. 1 milder reaction  weathered at home. 
Go back to your death echo chamber and I'll retreat back in to the real world.</p>

        <p>I read every word.  I'm so sorry for you and many others that these events have happened at such a turning point in most young people's lives.</p>
<p>I hope your transition to SD works out for you and am wishing you the best.  Stay true to your beliefs while being open-minded; that's the only way we can truly continue to function.</p>
