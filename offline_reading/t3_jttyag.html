        <p>Wtf is with these governors?!  Its like they are on a schedule or something.    One makes an announcement then its like they fall all over one another in cascading fashion, every progressing one getting more and more ridiculous.    Oregon gov just said "2 More Weeks (tm)" back to Tier 1 lockdown, extending past Thanksgiving.     FFS, where have we heard this before ?</p>
<p>You really think its only going to be two weeks, you lying, POS, corrupt lame excuse for a governor?   Prove me wrong.</p>

        <p>West Virginia has had the most interesting response in the country, if I'm being honest. They assumed an apocalyptic event when the first cases were still in Seattle and New York was pretending old people don't exist. This was despite the fact they were the last state to receive a single testing kit.</p>
<p>The governor created a task force that spent weeks planning before one of the earliest shutdowns in the country. They used the national guard to make sure unemployment was dispersed on time and did a mass testing on nursing home residents once they finally had testing kits (which probably saved hundreds if not thousands of lives), among many other weird, but targeted responses in comparison to other states.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, they had a very detail oriented, local centered approach. Because of their early planning, the people involved were chosen before the media circus. That means their doomer is not the same doomer as the rest of the country.</p>
<p>They also have a pretty awesome <a href="https://dhhr.wv.gov/COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx">coronavirus data archive</a> and it's worth checking out. They have trend graphs, demographics, a breakdown of all the longterm care facilities. They don't list deaths by age, but they do announce the age and county of each death on the news, so everyone is aware of what age group is dying.</p>
<p>Somehow, they also had excellent tax receipts to the point they are in a budget surplus and are talking about eliminating the income tax. Literal magic is happening in the mountain state (praise mothman).</p>
<p>My point is that, by all measures, West Virginia has had a very organized and effective response that any doomer would approve of, but they were unable to eliminate the coronavirus in West Virginia. Because it can't be done.</p>

        <p>These erratic lockdowns don't bode well for our futures. How's anyone supposed to make plans when we can't even count on the economy to remain open or function in a predictable way without ridiculous restrictions and rules being made up as they go? </p>
<p>At this rate, by next year, museums will have to move their exhibits to outdoor indoor in tents, we'll be forced to wear 2 masks and a face shield, you won't even be allowed to touch things in stores and a sanitized worker would have to retrieve it for you, we'll have hand-washing police in every public rest room, if you're caught coughing even once in public, you'll be detain under suspicion of Covid, and businesses will request they spray you with sanitizer before entry. But it's all 'for our own good' so can't hold it against them -_-''.</p>
