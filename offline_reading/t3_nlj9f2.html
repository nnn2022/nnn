    <strong>How do I come out to my Canadian parents?</strong>
    <p><p>This is not really a question but an answer to the question.
How to come out to you family.  But not Karen at the supermarket. Just smile and act like you didn’t hear her. Ignore her and spend more money in the fruits and vegetable section than the carbonated drinks, snacks or cookies section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I explain to my Canadian parents why I am vaccine hesitant?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A:  <strong>"Mom, Dad. I know you love me and are worried about me. I trust the doctors, scientists and safety researchers at the FDA and when the vaccines pass their clinical trials in 2022-2023 and are then approved by the FDA I will take them.</strong> Ever since reading about the Thalidomide Tragedy I am hesitant about taking medicine that hasn't been sufficiently tested for a few years. I trust the scientific method of testing and analyzing the results. I think everyone has been working very hard the past 16 months to approve a vaccine, and I don't really know what corners have been cut. I felt comfortable with taking my other vaccines since they were approved in the regular way and not through an Interim Order published six months after it they started testing them.</p>
<p>I am concerned about you too. The good news is that the CDC say that mask-less  fully vaccinated people don’t have to worry about social distancing. So you are safe if I don't get the vaccine! And statistically I feel pretty safe. Let me show you why: As of the May 21, 2021 the Government of Canada website reports that for confirmed cases:</p>
<p>(https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html#a7) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[USE ONE OF THESE:]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 0-19 age bracket there is a 1.7% chance of hospitalization, 1.2% chance of being admitted to the ICU and a 0.0% chance of me dying. </p>
<p>In the 20-29 age bracket there is a 3.8% chance of hospitalization, 2.6% chance of being admitted to the ICU and a 0.2% chance of me dying. </p>
<p>In the 30-39 age bracket there is a 6.4% chance of hospitalization, 5.5% chance of being admitted to the ICU and a 0.5% chance of dying.</p>
<p>In the 40-49 age bracket there is a 8.7% chance of hospitalization, 9.9% chance of being admitted to the ICU and a 1.1% chance of dying.</p>
<p>In the 50-59 age bracket there is a 14.3% chance of hospitalization, 19.6% chance of being admitted to the ICU and a 3.3% chance of dying.</p>
<p>In the 60-69 age bracket there is a 17.7% chance of hospitalization, 26.6% chance of being admitted to the ICU and a 8.8% chance of dying.</p>
<p>In the 70-79 age bracket there is a 19.9% chance of hospitalization, 23.8% chance of being admitted to the ICU and a 19.9% chance of dying.</p>
<p>In the 80+ age bracket there is a 27.6% chance of hospitalization, 10.7% chance of being admitted to the ICU and a 66.2% (2:1 odds) chance of dying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm comfortable with those odds. I think they are probably even better. The WHO estimates that the number of infections is anywhere between 10 to 20 times the number of confirmed cases. 
(WHO Estimates Coronavirus Infected 10% Of World’s Population, "On Monday, Dr. Michael Ryan, the WHO’s head of emergencies, said according to its “best estimates,” one in 10 people worldwide has contracted Covid-19. This would mean that 760 million of the world’s population of 7.6 billion may have been infected. Counts from the WHO and Johns Hopkins University put the total number of infections just above 35 million (0.5% of the world’s population) as of Monday morning" 
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/10/05/who-estimates-coronavirus-infected-10-of-worlds-population/  , October 2020.)</p>
<p>Also since suicides, homicides, drug overdoses, falling steel-safe accidents and car accidents can be counted here in Ontario as COVID deaths that skews the numbers in an even more negative way. 
("Individuals who have died with COVID-19, but not as a result of COVID-19 are included in the case counts for COVID-19 deaths in Toronto [following provincial orders]".

<p>Mom, Dad...I know you trust the Government of Canada with the testing of the vaccines since you took them. So I think it's fair to also trust the Government of Canada with their statistics. You've always supported me in the past. You've always told me to make my own choices. You've always told me to respect myself and my body. You told me to stand my ground against peer pressure. You encouraged me not to do things with my body that I'm uncomfortable with. And I thank you for making me what I am today: an independent person that values my body autonomy. <strong>I love you for it!</strong></p>
<p>Now let's all go for a walk outside in the sun! I heard that some people with Vitamin-D deficiencies and obesity do the worst if they get COVID-19. Getting fresh air and being healthy is one but one way of doing our part to help defeat the spread of COVID. Plus I like walking and talking with you.</p>
<p><strong>[AMEND LETTER AS NECESSARY]</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>[OPTIONAL - IN NOVA SCOTIA PROTESTS ARE ILLEGAL]</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go for the walk downtown. There is a the combined White Supremacy, QAnon, Proud Boy, "The Flat Earth Society", "Hating BIPOC Together", "MuH FrEeDuMbS (SoRrY)", MAGA, Anti-BLM, "Violent Neckbeards Against TransFolk", "Eldercide For a Better &amp; Caring Canada", "Angry Old White Men Creating A Misogynistic Tomorrow - Today", Anti-Semitism, "Karens against 5G Microchips", "The People's Front of Judea", NAMBLA, "Bring Back Polio NOW!", <strong>Anti-lockdown</strong> and "Homophobics Against Returning Shopping Carts" rally I want to go to. We should be able to arrive in time for the two minutes of hate. I think it's It's either Bill Gates or Mr Rogers this week.
Last time I was late and they ran out of those swastika cookies with raisins that I really like.</p>
