        <p>Good news if it‚Äôs true. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs still the issue of people spreading it before they show symptoms or having such mild symptoms they don‚Äôt recognise it as being sick at the time.</p>

        <p>So it‚Äôs probably wise the article leaves out the conclusion:</p>
<p>households will continue to be a significant venue for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>And the objective: </p>
<p>To examine evidence for household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by several covariates, and to compare it with other coronaviruses.</p>
<p>This study was not to figure out the infection rate of symptomatic to asymptomatic cases man. It should not be cited as such...unless you want to cherry pick data which the article by ‚Äúthe bad cat‚Äù states it didn‚Äôt want to do.</p>

        <p>But you are quoting a study which the objective was not the infection rate of asymptomatic to symptomatic, you are quoting a study that focused on household transmission.</p>
<p>It is cherry picking data, and your quote is a bad inference from said data. You can‚Äôt look at a study for data in regards to another hypothesis not stated in the objective; that is why papers state the objective! üòÇ using that to undermine every other study is just illogical.</p>
