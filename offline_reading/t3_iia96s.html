    <strong>Went shopping today: Target has both entrances open and goodwill has their dressing rooms open.</strong>
    <p><p>I strongly believe this is influenced by the fact that kids have gone back to school in my area and people are getting back to being busy again. </p>
<p>There’s hope!</p></p>

        <p>The Goodwills near me all still have fitting rooms closed, which irritates me to no end. If you return a garment, they "quarantine" it for 24 hours before returning it to the store racks, like it's nuclear fallout. Ralph's and most supermarkets all have both entrances open.</p>

        <p>My Targets have always had both entrances open (their entrance and exit doors are basically right next to each other). Walmarts didn't, and still don't, though the capacity limits are non-existant now at least.</p>
<p>The Goodwills and other thrift stores I've been to still have their dressing rooms closed. In fact, most stores are still doing the ridiculous "Buy it, try it on at home, bring it back if you don't like it" bullshit.</p>

        <p>It's so weird and dumb.  Safeway near me has second entrance closed months after they stopped counting people.  What possible reason could there be for keeping this other door locked?  So crazy.</p>

        <p>Raley's has permanently closed one of their doors because of constant theft. They did this a few months before there was any word of the virus. I still wonder how the fire martial allows that.</p>

        <p>Lucky! I'm in WA and went to 2 different thrift stores yesterday looking for some good finds. I found out AFTER looking through all the dresses that the fitting rooms were closed. Fuck that. You expect me to spend my money on something that might look like trash on me just to only be able to return it within 2 weeks for store credit only? I'll just go spend a little more cash somewhere with fitting rooms open. Which for some reason is literally every other store. It makes no sense, I saw people trying on clothes over their clothes in the middle of the isles anyway, what's the point of having the damn things closed? On the plus side i met a nice old lady who just wanted to chit chat wth someone who wasn't wearing a mask. She pulled hers down (I was wearing only a face shield) and we had a nice convo about how stupid this all this was.</p>

        <p>She was a delight! I could tell she only wore the mask to get into the store the second she started talking to me. I smile and hum to myself a lot and she said it was so nice to see someone's smile.</p>
<p>I actually support a couple older folks with developmental disabilities and they act really normal as well. The pretty much refuse to put their masks on when we go out and I don't push the issue. We don't go to stores or anything anyway, my company won't allow it. We go to the park every day though, sometimes twice and we just sit and have our picnics, just like we did last summer.</p>
<p>My partner though. Ooof. They told me the other day they yelled at the delivery guy for not wearing a mask and I just went "uh huh" with the most unamused look on my face and had to keep it in. I know for a fact that my partner draws the line at the vacciene but I just wish i could get them to see that the masks and lockdowns are just security theater to warm us up to the vacciene and after that we're lost. I need them to fight with me now, not later.</p>

        <p>Yikes that’s rough. What kills me about the masks is... it “protects others from your germs” but if you wear an N95 mask on a plane then they will ask you to wear a plain cloth mask instead because an N95 has a valve and only protects the wearer. If <em>everyone</em> wore N95s, wouldn’t everyone be equally protecting themselves and preventing the spread of the virus also? Besides... cloth masks don’t do anything. We know that already!
I don’t care much about a vaccine. Want one? Make it. Take it. Leave the rest of us alone though. It’s not like we’re talking about small pox. Ugh!</p>

        <p>Fingers crossed this happens everywhere as schools reopen. In the UK that's next week for most. Our gov did flip flop over masking being made mandatory in schools unfortunately though (right after the deputy CMO stated that kids are more likely to be hit by a car than die of covid).</p>
<p>I think it's a case the more people getting busy living, the more the panic struck people will dwindle in numbers and look sillier and sillier.</p>

        <p>That’s good. I always wondered about the entrance thing. I can understand why people would want a specific entrance and exit side, but a Safeway near me just closed off one entrance entirely. So they’re basically just cramming everyone to one side to enter/exit. Isn’t that the opposite of what they want to achieve? Lol</p>
