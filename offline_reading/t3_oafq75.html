        <p>If we took all the 'positive' 'cases' from the PCR Test that are not symptomatic, and are simply sent home with no further treatment, which is about 99% of them..</p>
<p>with only 1% 'active' - which then must also be diagnosed as covid19 or flareups of other issues as a result.. some needing hospitalization.</p>
<p>and about 1% of that 1% may end up in the ICU, and with a lowest reported recovery rate of 95% (in 82+ years of age with 3-4 pre-existing conditions).</p>
<p>that means 5% of that 1% of that 1% end up dead.</p>
<p>This is not an emergency. The emergency ended April-May 2020</p>
<p>People are just unaware of how many deaths happen in their country on a daily basis, and also ignore competing death counts, like the flu, respiratory ilness, heart disease and diabetes... all who beat covid19 hands down in the same time.</p>
<p>Pair that up with a very real fact that with an aging population of Boomers, the numbers of deaths will increase through 2030 at least.. as they drop off.. Will their numbers be used to continue to scare people?</p>

        <p>We trusted the Chinese scientists that gave Christian Drosten the genetic code, <em>“without virus material”,</em> to build the bogus “Covid” PCR test protocol but we don’t trust Chinese scientists that stated there’s no “viable virus” in PCR positive cases.” ^1, ^2, ^3</p>
<h2>Christian Drosten created the “Covid” PCR test:</h2>
<p>&rt;<strong>”without having virus material available”</strong> ^1, ^2</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence published on the internet”</strong> ^2, ^1</p>
<p>&rt;”Christian <strong>Drosten, has contradicted himself on the reliability of PCR testing.</strong> In a 2014 interview regarding PCR testing for so-called MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia he said: ^4</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>The [PCR] method is so sensitive that it can detect a single hereditary molecule of the virus. For example, if such a pathogen just happens to flutter across a nurse’s nasal membrane for a day without her getting sick or noticing anything, then she is suddenly a case of MERS.</strong> Where fatalities were previously reported, <strong>now mild cases and people who are actually in perfect health are suddenly included in the reporting statistics.</strong> This could also explain the explosion in the number of cases in Saudi Arabia. What’s more, the <strong>local media boiled the matter up to unbelievable levels.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Dr. Pieter Borger said, ”The virus wasn’t in Europe and the paper was already finished.”</strong> He said these facts “should have been on television long ago. I explained it on LinkedIn, but you get banned if you do.” **Regarding PCR he said, “You are not detecting a virus.” ^2</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”German lawyer Reiner Fuellmich</strong>who is central to a growing group of lawyers, scientists, politicians, and even secret pharmaceutical whistleblowers, said in an interview, ”We believe that in order to make this house of cards collapse, we have to attack the PCR test. <strong>The fact is, there are no asymptomatic infections.”</strong> ^1</p>
<p>&rt;This seemingly radical claim was bolstered by a paper out of Wuhan of all places, published by Nature.com, which found no “viable virus” in PCR positive cases.</p>
<p>&rt;”The screening of the 9,865,404 participants without a history of COVID-19 found no newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, and identified 300 asymptomatic positive cases with a detection rate of 0.303 (95 % CI 0.270–0.339)/10,000. … A total of 1174 close contacts of the asymptomatic positive cases were traced, and they all tested negative for the COVID-19. … Of the 34,424 participants with a history of COVID-19, 107 tested positive again, giving a repositive rate of 0.310% (95% CI 0.423–0.574%.) <strong>Virus cultures were negative for all asymptomatic positive and repositive cases, indicating no “viable virus” in positive cases detected in this study.”</strong> ^1, ^3</p>

        <p>Yes, Mullis invented the PCR manufacturing technique. Christian Drosten developed the faulty “Covid” PCR testing protocol.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic? That's kind of like when they found the LiteBrite-style Advertisements for Aqua Teen Hunger Force in Boston in 2007 and called them "inert devices" in a press statement after they'd shut down the entire city and the bomb squad determined the device was, in fact, a LiteBrite.</p>

        <p>"2 in medical induced comas and on ventilators"... You do know that hospitals get financial incentives for doing this to patients right? They will get wayyy more money from the government for mistreatment rather than just sending them home.</p>
