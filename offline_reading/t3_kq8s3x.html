    <strong>Long Angry Rant.</strong>
    <p><p>Why all these people want to spread all these insults, negativity and BS anecdotes is beyond me. Nobody is awake and all these people are just dumb. They are dumb. They've been brainwashed by centralized education. They don't know how to think. They know how to memorize whatever BS anyone with "authority" tells them. They don't know how to THINK. They don't do any actual research. They don't have any actual points to make. They are just dumb and spreading negativity everywhere they go because deep down, they know they are of inferior intellect, because they don't know how to use their own brains. There is a term used when discussing narcissism called "projection" and that is exactly what these people are doing.</p>
<p>You got empty hospitals on film and doctors and nurses dancing around.... they say "overflowing"</p>
<p>You got a "deadly" pandemic, but a piece of cloth is gonna save you? Really? Staying six feet away is gonna save you when they already said the virus can go over 20ft through the air?</p>
<p>You got 23 trillion dollar national debt and printing more money is gonna solve the problem? Where do you think the debt comes from? None of these people understand centralized banking, so they have no idea how the economy actually works.</p>
<p>You got rent moratoriums but no mortgage moratorium so what are these landlords supposed to do? Lose their ass, I guess. Nobody cares. Landlords are bad in these people's minds because they want money. Duh. Nobody is asking why the government isn't doing anything for them. Use your brain. Why would the government not offer bailouts for mortgages? They want you to get foreclosed. They don't want you owning property.</p>
<p>You got the government closing businesses arbitrarily. Walmart open.... Uncle Jim's grocery store....closed! Or open less hours so it's still screwing the workers and owners. Why? Nobody can say why. We saw in Tennessee how the city council was trying to lie and say 80% of cases traced back to bars and restaurants in order to justify closing them, but in reality less than 2% were traced to restaurants. Why? Why would they lie about this? Use your brain. They don't want these small businesses around. They want to have you by the balls working minimum wage at some Walmart until they decide it's "safe". When is that? After the vaccine? You are totally blind if you think the vaccine is going to make anything better. Fauci already said we still have to wear masks after being vaccinated because they don't even know if the vaccine works.</p>
<p>They outright tell you they don't know if the vaccine works or not. Common sense people! 90% effective. How do they know that? Does that mean I have 90% less symptoms or I'm 90% less likely to catch the virus? They say "the vaccine will prevent severe symptoms" What does that mean?! It sounds like they don't know what the hell they are doing. </p>
<p>You got a congress that is going to add 5000 pages of pork and give hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign countries after 6 months of BS about "helping people" but somehow can never come to any agreement about anything. If you think they don't know people are drowning, you're outta your mind. If you think it's not on purpose, you're outta your mind.</p>
<p>You got greedy people sitting at home salivating over enhanced unemployment, pretending to be scared of a virus so they don't have to work. These type of people are so dumb they think communism is a good thing. And they don't even understand how the damn economy works.</p>
<p>You got the TV blaring at you: "new record for cases in a day" but if you shut it off and go outside, you don't see it. Where's all the dead homeless people? Why aren't they dropping dead in the streets like the videos we all saw from China at the beginning? </p>
<p>We are listening to China, using whatever "research" China shares with us, knowing that their whole scientific body is 100% controlled by the state and they are now refusing to share any information they have found regarding the origins of this virus with anyone. If you believe they got rid of this virus with a 10 week lockdown you are just blind. Not to mention the WHO and their extensive history of lying and fear mongering about pandemics that never materialized in the past.</p>
<p>You got a man in the Whitehouse who literally said in an interview that if he and his VP disagree he will just fake an illness and step down. If you don't see what is happening here, I just can't help you anymore. </p>
<p>It's not conspiracies when Rockefeller said "I don't want a nation of thinkers. I want a nation of workers" and then proceeds to fund the first general education board and public schools. He also funded a lot of black colleges. Spelman is his wife's maiden name. And the rockefeller foundation still funds educational projects to this day. Einstein also said "never confuse education with intelligence" and he hit the nail right on the damn head with that one.</p></p>

        <p>Oh the "vaccine" will absolutely be effective. But not at preventing coronavirus. Previous mRNA trials all had to be halted because they caused either death or autoimmune disease in animal models. There were no animal models for this jab. The guinea pig for long term effects (i.e. autoimmune disease) will be you.</p>

        <p>A big thing I don't understand is why people are so worried about long term effects from the virus, but they don't seem to care at all about long term effects of the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I mean it's pretty simple. They don't want to seem like an antivaxxer. The fact of the matter is though that while most vaccines against childhood diseases are fine, even beneficial, we have a long history of vaccine related injury. Think polio shots contaminated with SV40 that gave people cancer, the swine flu vaccine of the 70s that was massively rushed and paralyzed people, etc. </p>
<p>It's right, even prudent, to be skeptical of any new vaccine when it first comes out. To weigh the risks and benefits of taking something new, especially in light of the fact that if something goes wrong the law is set up in such a way that you have zero legal or civil recourse. To know anything about previous failed attempts to develop mRNA vaccines and willingly sign up for this one screams a desire for conformity so strong that you might as well be a suicidal lemming to me. Then again, it's not like our schools encourage critical thinking.</p>
