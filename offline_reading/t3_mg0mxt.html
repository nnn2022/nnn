        <p>I swear if I have to head another person moralize about "if we had only all followed the rules this would all be over!!!!" Willfully ignoring the militarized lockdowns around the world that are still in progress or have very minimally eased restrictions. Pointless attempts to feel superior to the rest of people but only exposes their antisocial nature. Are they just uneducated or unable to accept the truth, since their entire self-worth hinges on how dutifully they stayed inside, ordered greasy takeout, and binge-watched Netflix while ranting about that one shopper at Walmart who let their mask slip under their nose for .2 seconds?</p>

        <p>I was surprised to think that these people don't know that anyone getting a jab IS a part of the trials!</p>
<p>&rt;"But the next question that needs to be answered is how long immunity from vaccination lasts. I think the clinical trials only followed participants for 3 months?"</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&rt;"Most of the people in the trials are still being followed. I wanted to sign up for a trial in my area but you had to commit to a minimum of 18 months of monthly follow ups."</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&rt;" I know I HEARD that it may be something to the tune of two years, but we'll find out."</p>
