<title>Kony 2012 (Kony-12) was a social media experiment to test how well "social justice uprisings" could be viralized through a network of text, pic &amp; video platforms. It was the pretense to the scamdemic. They need to validate the stupidity of the masses first before unleasing the scamdemic.</title>

    <p><p>Who in here remembers? Then it was ultimately exposed as scam (on purpose). </p>
<p>The platforms that performed the best, remained,  received more funding and suspicially this occurred around the time of FB IPO making Zuck the youngest self made billionaire (followed by another, kylie Jenner, another socially constructed entity, who has the same intellect and work ethic as zuck, which is zero . Another subject however) </p>
<p>People like me who were very early data privacy whistle blowers (reference face book scandal) and also a pre-instagram prototyper of  influencer marketing (no irony here) were dismissed as conspiracy nut jobs. Even though the concept of viral social awareness was my actuall job at the time. </p>
<p>Excuse the typos. Edited: to add context</p></p>
