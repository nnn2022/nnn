        <p>Counter point: contrary to making us safer, the FDA approval of drugs actually increases risk in society.</p>
<p>If the FDA did not approve drugs, then consumers wouldn't blindly accept any medicine on the market.  In a more caveat emptor society, individuals would do their own research on medical treatments.  How long has the drug been available?  Have there been a history of side effects?  Are the risks of the medicine worth the potential risk?</p>
<p>"Just take it, it's FDA approved" is ruining society.</p>

        <p>&rt;In a post-war era when sleeplessness was prevalent, thalidomide was marketed to a world hooked on tranquilizers and sleeping pills. At the time, one out of seven Americans took them regularly. The demand for sedatives was even higher in some European markets, and the presumed safety of thalidomide, the only non-barbiturate sedative known at the time, gave the drug massive appeal. <strong>Sadly, tragedy followed its release, catalyzing the beginnings of the rigorous drug approval and monitoring systems in place at the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today.</strong></p>
<p>Not anymore</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>In July of 1962, president John F. Kennedy and the American press began praising their heroine, FDA inspector Frances Kelsey, who prevented the drugâ€™s approval within the United States despite pressure from the pharmaceutical company and FDA supervisors.</strong> Kelsey felt the application for thalidomide contained incomplete and insufficient data on its safety and effectiveness. Among her concerns was the lack of data indicating whether the drug could cross the placenta, which provides nourishment to a developing fetus.<br>
She was also concerned that there were not yet any results available from U.S. clinical trials of the drug. Even if these data where available, however, they may not have been entirely reliable. At the time, clinical trials did not require FDA approval, nor were they subject to oversight.</p>
