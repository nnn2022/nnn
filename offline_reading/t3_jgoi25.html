    <strong>Brainwashed people not bothered about social distancing?</strong>
    <p><p>I've noticed that while brainwashed people are super defensive about masks,  they are not at all bothered about social distancing.</p>
<p>At least in shops and supermarkets here in the UK.</p>
<p>Everybody is walking about close to each other, less than 2 ft apart let alone 2 mt, brushing against each other sometimes, and nobody seems troubled.</p>
<p>So why are they so super-sensitive about masks?</p>
<p>Is it simply because they are generally low-EQ people who respond mostly to sensory stimuli rather than their own independent thought?</p></p>

I very long ago stopped trying to figure out these people.   They are aimless sheep are just walking around doing the last dumbass thing Dr. Faucci told them.  </p>

        <p>I would rather people stay 2 meters away from me in the supermarket then wear a mask. Does my head in the way people walk in front of my trolley or stand in the bloody way. I have such bad trolley rage!</p>
<p>I honestly think they have so much belief in the stupid masks. They get a trolley that has not been cleaned, or wiped down..then get their mask and put it on..so already the germs or whatever is now on the mask. But it's okay cos they are protected..ðŸ™„</p>

        <p>CNN just put out an article saying that if everyone wore masks, 100,000 lives could be saved and that our current mask compliance levels (49%) will cause a million deaths. Their source is the IHME model which has been proven to be grossly inaccurate, but whatever.</p>

        <p>Maybe they're not the brainwashed people, just people who are not bothered about socal distancing or masks but are wearing face coverings because they need to shop.</p>
<p>I don't agree with any of it but I wear a face covering scarf to shop because I don't want my local businesses getting closed down for letting in folks without face coverings.</p>
<p>The powers that been will target the bussinesses and the smaller independents will be the easy targets and the first to go.</p>

        <p>True. I'm a cashier at a grocery store and throughout ALL of this, I have had <em>one</em> customer tell the people behind them to stay 6 feet away.</p>

        <p>Oh I noticed this a long time ago. I live in NYC and grocery stores here are so small it would be impossible to avoid being within 6 feet of another human being. I'm also baffled by the people that space out 6 feet waiting for the bus, but then have no problem sitting right on top of each other on the bus. Think about it. It would simply be impossible to avoid being 6 feet from another human being at all times.</p>
<p>And that's just the trouble. No one's thinking about it. You use the word brainwashed- you need a brain for it to be washed. Most people accept what they hear without question. They don't use their brains very often. I think people latch on to the masks in particular because it's an easy thing they can control. Social distancing in a grocery store isn't so they quietly drop it.</p>

        <p>Originally staying apart was said to be way more important than masks, and it makes sense since if someone is too far away to sneeze on you, then they cant sneeze on you. One thing people do forget is even if you have a mask on, and you dont pull it down to cough or sneeze, you still need to cough into your elbow anyways. I do think masks work (to a much lesser extent than people would have you believe) but I also think that its definitely not the best defense we have and that it's not really a long term solution. Yeah if they were used exactly perfectly correctly all the time it would be helpful, but we do forget we are dealing with human beings here, and they are not comfortable to wear or practical to use. People write off comfort often, but I think maybe the people saying comfort doesn't matter dont overlap a whole lot with people who've worn masks all day every day all year</p>
