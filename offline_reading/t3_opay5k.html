    <strong>Tired..</strong>
    <p><p>So tired of this world, the elite are just constantly fucking us in the ass.</p>
<p>My dad lost his job, my brother did, I did all because of this killer virus.</p>
<p>They give you 1000(!)-1400 euro that isn't even enough to pay your house lol you have to take loans from people/friends to not eat ramen noodles everyday</p>
<p>It has been over 500 days, my mental health is low rn and so is my financial health.</p>
<p>I almost never post on Reddit but I have been lurking here and wanted to rant abit to like minded people.</p>
<p>I am so tired, I don't care about anything anymore I am just waiting for people to stand up so I can either die protesting or go back to a normal live.</p>
<p>Where i wanted to travel the world and grow my business...</p></p>

        <p>Yeah dude. It's fucked. Before the plandemic we were getting fucked in the ass, many just weren't aware of it (atleast not to this degree). I guess if this hadn't happened, the mask wouldn't be unveiled. We got your back. Let us hope that more people wake up soon.</p>
<p>Stay strong brother/sister. Remember, we are creative creatures, I am certain you will be able to figure out some other ways of surviving.</p>

        <p>I have no disagreement with what they said.  Most people don't want to face the truth.  This is NOT going to get any better.  Largely because almost no one is willing to do what is necessary.  "Peaceful protests" will do nothing to stop this.</p>

        <p>Two of my cousins are unemployed, another is on UK Perma furlough, and his job was in tourism, so I guess he will lose his as soon as furlough ends...</p>
<p>My direct family is alright, parents have retired (and unvaccinated - but they are also part of that seemingly tiny percentage of late 50s people that are fit, not fat or on any regular medication) , but their plans to travel the world aren't really on anymore... </p>
<p>I've taken a five figure paycut (net, post tax take home pay at that) due to reduced workload (I work in engineering consultancy, and if companies are being fucked economically, they won't outsource work to us)</p>
<p>Fortunately I can live with a five figure paycut, without losing my home, can still manage car payments etc... but I doubt many other people under 30 can say that. </p>
<p>I'm tired of this shit as well, and I know my situation could be be much worse, and I really feel for anyone that is being bankrupted by government malice and ineptitude...</p>

        <p>It might not seem like much but take solace from the fact that you are being honest and true, most of all to yourself. Your external life is taking a beating right now. I get it, believe me I do. Can you imagine living a life where you took the vaccine that you don‚Äôt believe was safe? </p>
<p>It will destroy your inner world, who you are. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs very difficult for us to deal with this situation but ask yourself, ‚Äòright now, in this moment, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äô If your not bleeding out in the moment your okay. It‚Äôs hard to keep it in the moment, I know but keep trying, read something that will help. Worrying about what‚Äôs going to happen won‚Äôt help you but it is PERFECTLY NORMAL. </p>
<p>Stand tall and look up because if you feel you‚Äôve done the right thing (and I think you have) you deserve to feel well pleased with your choice especially in the face of all this adversity. </p>
<p>Never forget that there are countless millions who have  taken the vaccine against their own very being. They quelled their own soul into subjugation through of fear and lack of courage. How mindless, awful an existence they live. Who they are is fading into an infertile, vacuous, sea of drone like entities. At the very least you are not like that. You are much more besides.</p>
