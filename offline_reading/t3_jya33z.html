    <strong>How come the death rate for COVID in Japan, India and Singapore are 0.02-0.05% but in Western countries the death rates are 10x higher than that?</strong>

<p>This translates to an 0.02% IFR.</p>
<p>Kobe, Japan had a similar serosurvey done. 0.06% IFR. For every case they found, there were a whopping 200+ cases missed.</p>
<p>In Singapore the IFR is 0.05%, not due to serosurveys, but quick and very extensive testing https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/singapore/</p>
<p>India is also reporting very high levels of spread (~50% seroprevalence in some areas already) and a very low death rate, as well. https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/30/asia/india-covid-antibody-study-intl-hnk-scli/index.html</p>
<p>https://indianexpress.com/article/india/coronavirus-india-live-updates-covid-vaccine-news-delhi-maharashra-unlock-guidelines-active-cases-deaths-recoveries-7054014/ (0.03% IFR)</p>
<p>I'm not sure if median age of a country has much to do with this because Brazil's median age is 31 or 32. India's median age is currently 29 years old and Brazil's IFR estimate is almost 1 percent (0.8%)</p>
