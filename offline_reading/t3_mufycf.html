        <p>You mean like, masking?</p>
<p>Of course that avenue cannot be effective- there would be no need for "public health experts" to micromanage daily life.</p>

        <p>I've been saying, since all this started, that we are going to have more people die from cancer from all the biocides they've put all over everything in the world, than would die from COVID if we didn't disinfectant anything ever.</p>

        <p>&rt;‚ÄùAIDS and SARS are ways for epidemiologists (e.g., the CDC, WHO, etc.) to secure their jobs and continued funding for their agencies.¬†<strong>No new emerging epidemics, maybe no CDC, no WHO, so we've got an infrastructure that REQUIRES the "discovery" of new, threatening epidemics.</strong> And the media pick a new one every year.¬†This year, it's SARS. For the past couple of years, it's been West Nile Virus.¬†Next year it'll be something else.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Health departments deal with more themes than just epidemics, friend. I don‚Äôt agree with that statement. They are just corrupted.</p>

        <p>CDC is an outgrowth of Rockefeller‚Äôs <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/index.html">MCWA</a> and helps with <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2021/01/25/have-400000-americans-died-of-covid-19/">cooking the books.</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùControl of the Food and Drug Administration, health departments and other government agencies have given the Rockefeller Drug Cartel a virtual monopoly of marketing of drugs, especially of new drugs.‚Äù</strong> ^1</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùPortraying disease as severe, whether it is or not, is admittedly done because it helps to increase vaccine uptake. Recent CDC PowerPoint presentations ^(560) reveal this tactic with influenza, and doctors have written about it regarding pertussis as well. ^2</p>
<p>&rt;*Publicity given to the more severe consequences of whooping cough has created a widely held perception that the disease is always severe, debilitating, and dangerous. Such a perception helps to encourage immunization, but if untrue it degrades diagnostic accuracy... ^(561)</p>
<p>&rt;<em>There was the fear that this would interfere with many other forms of immunization which are far more beneficial and important to the infant. Those who expressed their disagreement with the broadcast conclusions stated that it might have the effect of increasing the incidence of death from pertussis and urged and secured publicity of opinions favoring continued use of the vaccine.</em> ^(562)‚Äù</p>
<p>&rt;*‚ÄùAfter World War II, diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria or pneumonia no longer triggered mass fatalities in industrialized nations such as affluent America. This became a huge problem for institutions like the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the American epidemic authorities, as redundancy threatened. In 1949, a majority voted to eliminate the CDC completely. Instead of bowing out of a potentially very lucrative industry, the CDC went on an arduous search for viruses.‚Äù ^3</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùIn the United States, vaccines are actively and incessantly promoted as the solution for all infectious diseases by such government agencies as the Center for Disease Control in Georgia, by HEW, USPHS, FDA, AMA and WHO. It is of more than passing interest that the federal agencies should be such passionate supporters of compulsory use of vaccines, and that they also should go through the "revolving door" to the big drug firms whose products they have so assiduously promoted, throughout their years of service to the public. It is these federal agents who have drafted the procedures which forced the states to enact compulsory vaccination legislation which had been drafted by the attorneys for the Medical Monopoly, to become "the law of the land." In the dim reaches of the past, when Americans were more protective of their now-vanishing freedoms, there was sporadic opposition to the threatened outrage which a dictatorial central government sought to impose on every child in the United States.‚Äù ^4</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùThe Rockefellers own the largest drug manufacturing combine in the world,</strong> and use all of their other interests to bring pressure to increase the sale of drugs.‚Äù ^5</p>

        <p>Somebody want to pass on that memo to the hundreds of restaurants and conveniences stores (mostly the latter, because what restaurant has a lobby anymore huh?) so they could reconsider those idiotic "NO REFILLS OR PERSONAL CUPS" signs on the beverage fountain? Wasteful AF, weren't we supposed to care about the environment? Or is that next year's crisis?</p>
