    <strong>This is not a new normal</strong>
    <p><p>It's a social prohibition, if you look on wikipedia, new normal is an industry term for massive changes after an unforseen event, usually to stop it from happening again.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Some examples include the drivers licence, vehicle safety features, black boxes in airplanes, and warning signs being plastered on everything.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>During 2020, it has been made illegal or even immoral to do the following things</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Parties</p>
<p>Formal events black or white tie <strong><em>(</em></strong><strong><em>a</em></strong><strong><em>nd no, there is no way in the entire universe i am MASKING up in a nice suit, it RUINS everything, enough said)</em></strong></p>
<p>Running a shop without perspex in place</p>
<p>Not dressing like a robber by wearing a mask</p>
<p>Not staying at least 2m away from other people, the same species as you</p>
<p>Trying on clothes</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And so much more, COVID-1984 signs are plastered everywhere, have invaded britains high streets like the martians did in the war of the worlds, signs warning of 'narrow walkways' benches taped up, and anything that's even remotely social, closed off, if we are not careful, they will take all public seating off of us, resturants are seperated, into horrific cubicles.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Another thing is that tradition has taken a big hit out of this, and many have used it as an excuse to 'phase out' various traditions, i see more anti-traditional content on askreddit then i normally do, the whole thing is frankly disgraceful.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm also looking for anyone out there, who runs a shop, or knows a shop, without perspex or 1984-esque propaganda in place.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>New normal mostly means something that is permanent, none of this can be permanent, this is why i call it the Social/Tradition prohibition, it could end tomorrow, 10 years, or never, but in my years on this planet, this the most pathetic, disgusting thing that has ever been done to our race, even worse then the alcohol prohibition.</p></p>

        <p>The time will come when people, even the most hardcore, will realize you need a life worth living to keep living—and the risk/reward calculation is no longer worth it.  It’s already happening under the guise of protest in many places: people are getting their social interaction while doing the mental gymnastics to pretend they’re still being ‘responsible’.</p>

        <p>I'd rather live, and get viruses like i used to, at least once every year, annoying yes, but it clears in a few days, and that feeling is amazing, there are millions of virus types out there, Sars COV 2 is only one, after all, what's the point of 'surviving' this? many people on the Hindenburg survived the 1918 pandemic, a much much deadlier pandemic, only to be killed in an airship disaster, and according to the date on the footage, five years ago now a woman in china was eaten alive by an escalator, what's the point of worrying about this virus? one of many things that can sometimes kill.</p>
<p>I could suddenly die now, it's not too far fetched, its called sudden death, and yet they worry about a 99.6% survival rate virus, a year before the original sars virus was even discovered, a tragic terrorist attack took place in america, many people lost their lives.</p>
<p>Anything can happen, so why worry about one virus? there's times in my life where i come really close to being knocked over, or even run over by a car had the driver not noticed me, why not make drivers do pedestrian safety lessons every now and then, instead of forcing cloth on everyones faces? so many ways to save lives, yet a peice of cloth apparently does it all.</p>

        <p>Been thinking about this too. It's called <em>carpe diem</em>, seize the moment. Or <em>memento mori</em>, being mindful of death as to live more fully. </p>
<p>None of us know how long we have left. Worrying about dying so much as to stop living is literally insane.</p>

        <p>There definetly would be a huge drop in people with the virus. I wouldn't ay cases because that applies to people with symptoms, usually severe enough to go to a hospital. But yeah, if they worked, it would be our of here by now.</p>

        <p>I think the six feet apart thing works somewhat, but the masks are a placebo. But five feet might work just as well, or even four. As long as you're not up in someone's face coughing and sneezing on their face or body.</p>

        <p>If any of this worked, you'd start to see correlations between how extreme national measures were and the amount of victims. </p>
<p>Look at Sweden, hardly took any measures and yet has half the COVID deaths that Belgium (a country with a similar population) has.</p>
<p>If you think that might be an outlier, look at Belarus, they flat out ignored the hysteria and COVID isn't on anyone's radar despite the massive protests currently going on. (they're trying to take down their dictator following yet another set of faked elections)</p>
