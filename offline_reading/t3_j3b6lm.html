        <p>Love or Hate Trump. I really think voting for him to win is the biggest middle finger you can give to the lockdown retards of the western world.</p>
<p>I don’t live in the U.S. though so not sure what will happen.</p>

/s. Also the entire population doesn’t need to be vaccinated for it to be effective. Also, Trump shoots from the hip and could easily be underestimating how much we can vaccinate at a time. I believe he and Fauci has said we can get 50 million vaccinated before the end of the year.</p>

<p>That's the keyphrase, isn't it? Yet they (Trump included) continue to push the need that everyone <strong>must</strong> get this vaccine.</p>

        <p>&rt;Because the rate of vaccination would never increase with time.</p>
<p>And this is the problem, the question was about when this would be generally available to the public. And this was his response. His front and center explanation of how it would get done would take 5-9 years to do. The article (not that I expect someone with Trump in their name to read and inform themselves) addresses this, that he probably meant this as supplemental, but he didn't even talk about the rest of his distribution plan. He probably doesn't have one or doesn't understand it.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, Trump shoots from the hip and could easily be underestimating how much we can vaccinate at a time.</p>
<p><a href="https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/shoot+from+the+hip">Shooting from the hip:
To speak or act rashly, recklessly, or bluntly, without consideration of potential consequences. An allusion to firing a handgun immediately upon drawing it from its holster without taking time to aim.</a></p>
<p>I definitely agree with this. His says things without regard to what they mean, without thinking about it, and with reckless regard to the facts and reality. I'm not sure why anyone would tout this out <em>in support</em> of Trump.</p>
<p>Maybe instead of shooting from the hip, he should be more careful and try to understand what is going on, rather than just saying the first idiotic thing that comes to his mind.</p>
<p>&rt;I believe he and Fauci has said we can get 50 million vaccinated before the end of the year.</p>
<p>And hopefully he's right. But there is also the logistical problem of getting the doses too everyone. And if we use that 200k a day, that still means those doses won't get distributed until like early September.</p>
