    <strong>I'm a high schooler thinking of sending this letter to my school superintendent, what does everyone think? Details in comment</strong>
    <p><p>- Dr. ------------,</p>
<p>I am writing to you as a student and a member of the community that deeply cares about the well-being of my peers and their families. This school district has been my home since kindergarten, and has provided me with an incredible quality of education, opportunities both academic and creative, and teachers and administration that have shaped who I am today. I am at the top of my class, I am a member of the National Honor Society, I am a National Merit Scholarship Semifinalist, I captain the high school's color guard which I have been a member of for four years, I am a competitor on our Academic Challenge and Science League teams, and I am in the middle of applying to colleges to further my education. None of this would have been possible without dedicated staff members and a strong community of learning. Now, in my final year of high school, I notice the unfortunate shortcomings of my district, especially in relation to school closings.</p>
<p>Students and families need something to rely on. We need a plan to fully reopen schools in a way that matters and that addresses the needs of all students. Too often we are strung along with "tentative" dates, uncertainty, no solid promises or concrete plans for moving forward. Our district has the potential to be a leader in addressing the concerns of students and committing itself to helping the community. Especially with the introduction of a coronavirus vaccine to protect the most vulnerable from serious illness, there is no sound reason to keep schools closed continuously.</p>
<p>It is easily seen that these school closures have been severely negative for students and families. Isolation from friends and peers is a proven detriment to the development of social skills and to mental health. Rates of depression and suicide are skyrocketing worldwide, especially among young adults and teenagers. Shutting down school, sports, activities, and events directly causes declines in mental health, and missing out on seasons or years of an activity can be disastrous for those relying on athletic scholarships or who have spent years in an activity, as I have, only to not be able to participate in it. Virtual schooling is a poor substitute for classroom learning, where it is far easier to collaborate, ask questions, and be truly involved in the learning process. Being parked in front of a screen for 6-7 hours daily without real human contact and few breaks to eat, stretch, or socialize is horrible for the physical and mental health of children, who for years have been urged to spend more time with people face to face, go outside, join activities, and limit electronic usage. Now, those who isolate themselves and spend a large part of their days on a screen are said to be doing things right, while ignoring their worsening health.</p>
<p>The typical virtual student wakes up, sits in front of a computer for 6 to 7 hours, stays inside all day, has no extracurricular activities, and does this for weeks or months at a time. Younger students rarely learn effectively without an attentive adult, and when teachers are remote, this burden falls on a parent, who rarely has the luxury of staying home to monitor their child's learning constantly when occupied with work. As a result, these children miss out on the vital initial years of schooling. It should go without saying that this is harmful to children. Myself and many other students as well as their parents are suffering from stress, eye strain, boredom, and hopelessness as this process is dragged out with no end in sight. A concrete plan, not subject to change, is necessary, and soon. No half- promises of someday opening will suffice any longer for those who go through endless redundant days of online assignments, confined to the four walls of a bedroom like a cell, afraid to speak up about their dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The health risks to students of isolation and constant screen usage far outweigh those of the virus. Time and time again it is proven that schools offer virtually zero transmission and that those under 45 years of age who are otherwise healthy have virtually zero chance of serious illness or death, and that asymptomatic transmission is basically impossible. Rising cases are the media's main headline for frightening the public, however, deaths and hospitalizations have dropped significantly since the spring and are virtually nonexistent for young people. Cases, also, are not the end-all for determining policy, as tests are notably inaccurate and pick up asymptomatic cases, which do not contribute to transmission. Scientific fact, not irresponsible media fear mongering, should be the basis of school policy. While public schools are shuttered, private schools in our area have continued in person schooling five days a week without incident, and the education gap between those who can afford private school and those who can't will widen significantly if change does not happen soon. Schools in many European countries have remained open as well, as these governments have emphasized the need to keep schools open above all else to ensure the welfare of their children. Meanwhile, suicide and mental illness is exploding among young people across the world, as are deaths by drug overdose. This is the true public health crisis among young adults. If we do not offer in person schooling full time, activities, sports, and support in school, we are doing nothing to stop this in our community and are only contributors. There are options that consider the needs of students who live with older relatives - a virtual option besides an all in-person option, for example - that do not constrain those who want and need to get back to in-person learning for their wellbeing and education.</p>
<p>My proposition is this - we need to create a plan to get students back in school, 5 days a week, within the coming months. There needs to be definite set dates where this will occur, and those dates will not change in the future. This should not be hypothetical - it should be done and communicated in plain terms to all students and families. Sports and activities will be opened. Events will take place. Virtual schooling will be an option for those who truly need it, not a default. Precautions as required by law will be followed to ensure good hygiene. If staff shortages are an issue for school reopenings, I will be more than happy to brainstorm solutions to this, such as increasing self-directed learning among students. </p>
<p>These changes will have incredible benefits for students, families, and the community as a whole. These changes make sense in the perspective of public health and keeping our students safe from worsening mental health issues, problems relating to too little physical activity, suicide, overdose, and more. These changes are necessary to ensure the health and safety of children and a return to normal life. I understand that hands may be tied by laws and guidelines, and perhaps my plan needs tweaking to better fit these. However, it is not often that one can be a leader and an example for others in such a meaningful way, and I urge you to seize this opportunity to stand up for our students. I humbly ask you - take this seriously. There are hundreds with the same concerns as myself who need something to happen. </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>XXXXX XXXXX</p>
<p>12th Grader</p>
<p>XXXXXXXXXXXX High School</p></p>

        <p>I think your letter is outstanding. The genuine concern for your classmates will be hard for them to ignore. </p>
<p>I'd recommend sending it to more people than just the superintendent. When I was in high school I sent a letter about something that bothered me to various higher ups in the district, and got replies from about half of them, not including the superintendent. Granted, this issue is much more important and relevant than what I was writing about. </p>
<p>Good luck! I was class of 2018 so I can tell you college is much less difficult to navigate right now than high school. I just took a few semesters off and worked full time, not really possible for a high schooler.</p>

        <p>I grew up in suburban NJ and I'm very proud that there are intelligent and thoughtful young people there still being raised well and thinking for themselves. Thank you and thanks to your family and the good teachers who helped you get there. This letter gives me more hope than anything else.</p>

        <p>Anyone who ridicules the idea of freedom does not deserve the privileges of living in the US. This is the most pathetic response I regularly hear. Have you ever visited a third world country? People literally die trying to come here for the freedom we have. You shit on every Honduran and Guatemalan and countless others who fucking walked here to obtain what we have when you say such uneducated nonsense. Patheticcccc</p>
