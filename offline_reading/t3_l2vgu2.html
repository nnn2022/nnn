    <strong>Protest lockdowns, not masks or testing! And take your vitamins!</strong>
    <p><p>Big pharma is one of the biggest benefittors as the pandemic continues. How come the government avoids talking about extremely useful vitamins and supplements that are known to help the immune system? If the government cared about all the Covid-19 deaths they would be promoting vitamin D non-stop.</p>
<p>It's apparent that lockdowns, unless set up while cases are still low, tend to do more harm than good. And corporations benefit the most.</p>
<p>What isn't bullshit, however, (and I hope this doesn't trigger too many prople) is mask wearing (while around those outside your circle) and frequent testing are the only ways we will begin to get our old lives back. The lockdowns will continue, and "fighting back" by partying as much as you can is just helping the narrative that lockdowns are necessary.</p>
<p>I mean do you not want this to end? Best thing you can do is live your best life <em>while</em> taking precautions to limit your exposure with others. And get tested! Say what you will about the testing, but I'm on a college campus and through extensive testing we were able to bring the percentages from 20-25%+ (with thousands of tests/day) to less than 0.5% positivity rate! And this is a giant party university! Most of us avoided big gatherings but there were no strict rules. There was a wave where many of my friends were getting sick, mostly mild, some more severe, and then with increased testing then we were able to relax more and worry less about spreading the virus. With frequent enough testing, it's possible for us to go back to what our lives once were.</p>
<p>Think of it as a fire, <em>once</em> it's small enough (few enough people have it), along with contact tracing, we can prevent it from community spread without extreme measures.</p>
<p>The reality is, fighting the masks don't do much good. Old people especially rely on accessing grocery stores that require masks, so please follow the rules given by the grocery stores so they are able to protect themselves as best as they can. The elderly make up most of the deaths, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't do what we can to protect them. Viral load has been determined to be a crucial element in disease severity, and masks greatly lower viral load, so it's no surprise we're seeing much less severe symptoms (and thus much less second hand transmittance) among people wearing masks.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33127906/</p>
<p>The best way out of this is to increase and improve testing to the point where we can return to better times. The main reason this isn't like the flu is it's infectectivity. If we can get the rate of transmission under 1 transmission per case, then transmission will die down over time. Promoting the spread is just delaying that from happening and creating new outbreaks that put <strong>more people out of work</strong>.</p>
<p>New Zealand was able to do it. Yes, they are an island which makes it easier for them. But their population also cares about science and protecting others which also makes it easier for them. With enough testing and contact tracing, we can do it too.</p>
<p>I'm not telling you to isolate from everyone, just please use the resources at your disposal to allow us to get through this faster rather than slower. If you've been out partying, wait ~4 days and get tested before meeting up with loved ones. If you're in contact with someone who's immunocompromised, limit your exposure to a small group of people for the time being. If you're meeting up with friends in an indoor space, do what you can to limit the chance of spread (distance, ventilation, masks if you're able). If you're visiting someone elderly or immunocompromised, wear a damn mask.</p>
<p>You guys have every right, however, to protest unjust lockdowns and hypocritical politicians. No one should be immune from scrutiny. I truly believe much of this is a big business money grab that's doing more harm than good. Seems like they would be focusing more on vitamins and healthy living if that weren't the case. Big pharma is getting paid big time. Take your vitamins!</p>
<p>But at the same time, there are ways to lower your risk of transmission fairly effectively simply by wearing a mask. I know it seems crazy, but those droplets flying out of antimaskers mouths when they're yelling at employees just doing their job are infectious (if they are infected)!</p>
<p>What we all want is to get out of this as soon as possible, so your actions should agree!</p></p>

        <p>If the masks really were that good, why are the UK now suggesting that people use an FFP mask instead of just the any old cloth over your face, or those cheap medical masks? </p>
<p>Why after all of this time are they now telling us to wear a stronger mask, that still won't be enough to stop the spread. It just might help lessen the chances of you passing it on. Might. </p>
<p>The tests are fucking useless. So many false results. </p>
<p>The only thing that actually does make any difference is the lockdowns, only that isn't something that can realistically be carried out to the extent they would be needed. Which would be indefinite lol. As soon as you release the lockdown, it starts to circulate again. </p>
<p>Then the vaccines....those are fucking useless too. They won't stop transmission. They also don't know if the South African and another strain will work with the vaccine. </p>
<p>What will work is by just accepting its a virus that is going to remain with us for a long long time, and we will have to live with it just like we do the flu. If we are lucky, after enough time has passed from doing that, covid might fade into the shadows and the flu will revive itself ðŸ¤”</p>

        <p>Can you give COVID-19 to anyone if you have had the vaccine?</p>
<p>The vaccine cannot give you COVID-19 infection, and a full course will reduce your chance of becoming seriously ill. We do not yet know whether it will stop you from catching and passing on the virus, but we do expect it to reduce this risk. So, it is still important to follow the guidance in your local area to protect those around you.
To protect yourself and your family, friends and colleagues you still need to:</p>
<p>practice social distancing</p>
<p>wear a face mask</p>
<p>wash your hands carefully and frequently</p>
<p>follow theÂ current guidance</p>
<p>Source: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-what-to-expect-after-vaccination/what-to-expect-after-your-covid-19-vaccination#:~:text=The%20vaccine%20cannot%20give%20you,to%20reduce%20this%20risk.</p>
<p>Shortage of PPE or not, they were first telling us not to wear masks as the only thing they would be good for would be to give a false sense of security. Possibly leading to more infections. Oddly enough, infections grew once mask mandates did come into effect. 
Either way, by telling us to now use a stronger mask, is kind of proving that the previous masks were ineffective. </p>
<p>The flu vaccine, yes I'm aware of its existence. Im also aware that thousands of people still died every year from it until covid came about. Then the flu deaths dramatically reduced.</p>

<p>Same goes for previous case of coronavirus. We can't know for sure unless we purposefully inject people with coronavirus. </p>

<p>I agree that bad advise has been given on both sides. But infections were stopped with the help of masks, studies show. I'd like to see a study that says otherwise and includes factors like proper practices.</p>

<p>Either way, by telling us to now use a stronger mask, is kind of proving that the previous masks were ineffective. </p>
<p>You're jumping to your confirmation bias. The N95 masks are 95% effective, which is an improvement from what fabric masks can offer. Why wouldn't they recommend something that's <em>more</em> effective now that it's available?</p>

<p>Why has it taken them so long to get these masks if they are so important? They were able to have ventilators made up sharpish at the beginning, but they couldn't mass produce masks? </p>

        <p>For me, the problem with your whole premise seems to hinge upon "so we can get back at it".</p>
<p>We're not going back to normal man.  There is no "getting back at it".</p>
<p>This is the Boxer The Horse argument in Animal Farm: <em>"I will work harder."</em></p>
<p>Boxer The Horse died in Animal Farm.  While the rest of the animals watched as the pigs made a deal with the humans to benefit themselves at the expense of the other animals on the farm.</p>

        <p>You can make the test more or less sensitive. If you make it too sensitive (more cycles), you run the risk of some false positives. If you make it less sensitive (fewer cycles) you run the risk of getting too many false negatives. I think in the end they decided is was better to get some false positives than to miss real positive results. Obviously there are going to be some labs that make poor decisions. What's the conspiracy?</p>

        <p>I can buy into most of this. </p>
<p>I am anti-lockdown. Have been since last April.</p>
<p>But I hate being dismissed as anti-mask.</p>
<p>I think masks are pointless and stupid. I hate seeing kids made to wear them in school. Etc, etc...</p>
<p>But wasting breath, energy, and credibility fighting mask mandates is like using moisturizer on skin cancer. </p>
<p>They are a symptom and a tool, and the biggest win they give the government and doomers is an easy way to discredit people lured into making this the meat of the argument. </p>
<p>It's unwinnable, and to most people, it's pathetic. </p>
<p>Don't wear them, that's fine, but shut up about it and crusade for the important rights instead.</p>

        <p>There is no "if" https://www.villages-news.com/2020/12/22/inflated-covid-19-numbers-were-aimed-at-making-president-trump-look-bad/
 I'm not a "Trumper" or any other political supporter, any one of them will sell your soul to stay in power.
However,  Biden has been in office for two days, and the most draconian states are already talking about easing lockdown restrictions.  Coincidence? I think not.</p>
