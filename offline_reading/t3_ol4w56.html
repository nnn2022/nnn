    <strong>Aaron Judge</strong>
    <p><p>Last post got removed because I didn't put a flair. Sorry mods - </p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is more of an irritation/aggravation type rant more than anything. I am a die hard New York Yankees fan. Aaron Judge has been the team's most iconic/best/beloved player for the past 4 seasons now. He is an upstanding person, and a great ball player. Yankees fans love him and he is very well known for his outstanding character.</p>
<p>That being said, it has just come out that he is unvaccinated, and apparently spread covid to some teammates and potentially other teams as well at the All Star Game in Colorado this past week. After that bit of news came out, Aaron Judge is now being drug through the mud on the Yankees sub and being berated. I've seen people saying petty stuff like he is no longer their favorite player, he is a disappointment and they want him off the team etc etc. I fear it is going to get worse for him and I am going to find a way to support him for standing up to the heat and not getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>His name is being tarnished currently and I've already seen people commenting that this will ruin his legacy and has changed their opinion of him. Now I know this is not important at all, but it just goes to show you how dumb this all is. The people he spread COVID to, were VACCINATED. They still got the virus.</p>
<p>Anyway, it really isn't important but I wanted to type out my frustration with my fellow fanbase of the Yankees. I hate to see my favorite player, and others favorite player get brought down like this and end up being demonized because he didn't want something unknown stuck in his body.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long, irrelevant post.</p></p>

        <p>That sucks, he’s my son’s favorite player too. Kinda wish idiots online talking about baseball players would just stick to the way someone plays baseball. I hope the pressure doesn’t force apologies and PR campaigning from his camp or the Yankees.</p>
<p>On a side note, how is the double-mask crowd rationalizing vaccinated people catching covid at a seemingly higher rate than non vaccinated people lately? I feel like I’m banned from most of the subs they interact in now, I wonder what the latest mental gymnastics involves</p>
