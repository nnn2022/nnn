    <strong>A Serious Suggestion</strong>
    <p><p>Some of you might have seen my previous post to this sub. If you haven't I'll sum it up as follows: In a nutshell I'm getting pretty sick and tired, as most of you are, of just watching idly as everything goes to shit around me. I wonder what can be done in addition to the small efforts that are already being made to push back against the new normal and put pressure on the government. I think that at this point we need to diversify our efforts beyond not masking up. We need credibility, legitimacy, and the ability to present our ideas without being labeled as right-wing quacks or conspiracy theorists by the media.</p>
<p>Okay, so how do we get there? What could we possibly do? Well we've got memes. I was reminded of the fact that memes influence elections by another user on another one of my posts, and they most certainly do. Influencers on social media have the ability to sway the masses more than MSM does - look at BLM if you don't believe me. No young man or woman is watching the news, they get their influence from social media. What we need is an influencer or influencers of note to push our agenda, I'm convince that that's the next step. We have the content, we have people that are good at packaging a message in a digestible format, we just don't have the outreach. Sharing memes amongst ourselves is great but it won't get anything done.</p>
<p>I'm suggesting serious effort here. Fund-raising if need be. I'll gladly pitch in a few hundred toward whatever financial figure a like-minded influencer might charge for posting content to their audience. This shit needs to get spread pronto, the US is a tinderbox right now and all we need is a spark here.</p></p>

        <p>Disengage with the state and large corporations by encouraging self- and community-reliance. Got spare food? Share it; save someone a trip to a supermarket and the petrol station. Can make herbal remedies? Better start handing those out or bartering! You don't want to be empowering Pfizer and Glaxo when you could treat symptoms out of a window-box. You <em>certainly</em> don't want to rely on cash these days. You grow seeds? Epic! Share those.</p>
<p>Take the initiative to launch a neighbourhood watch scheme and a self-sustaining energy grid (like the island of Eigg did). Get together to buy local woods and fields from whichever absentee owners hold them, and start squatting in abandoned housing. If anyone around you commits a crime against the state or a large company, you saw nothing. Local cashiers can always keep the change. Tip generously; feed the homeless and the pigeons; use DuckDuckGo; access any site with cookies through a VPN; decline pollsters and canvassers, and study workplace sabotage.</p>
<p>You will never have the weight or wealth to overcome the beast, but you can starve it.</p>

        <p>Hello... Myself and a few friends of mine are putting together a "non-nutcase" simple fact cheat-sheet for COVID and against lockdown and excessive measures.  Basically a COVID FAct sheet, with incontravertible facts only.</p>
<p>We are hoping this will help when discussing COVID with people.  Just a common-sense fact-sheet about UK stats, how the numbers have been and are being fudged, the high survival rate, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe if we all do something similar, we can come together and share them, for international coverage?</p>
