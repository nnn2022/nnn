    <strong>Why is anyone alright with any of this?</strong>
    <p><p>Right guys, what the actual fuck. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve been skeptical of this pandemic since I first heard rona mentioned on the news. After the whole Ebola situation and to be honest, basically any situation that‚Äôs been smashed all over the media in my lifetime, I just didn‚Äôt believe there was actually a crisis. There basically never is. ANYWAY, to start with I didn‚Äôt want to say much to anyone other than my family because, yknow, I was open to the idea that I was wrong. And some of the shit I was seeing on the news was extremely alarming. Unfortunately it was almost impossible to avoid the news, as we got forced to stay at home and watch it to figure out what we were and were not allowed to do. I also needed to find out when I could next wipe my sorry ass with a sheet of 3 ply. Yada yada yada yeet. </p>
<p>But now. Holy sweet fucking fuck. This is scientific fraud??? </p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what I want to ask you guys - has anyone managed to actually engage in a civilised conversation with any of these doomers, and figured out why why why they‚Äôre alright with scientific information getting censored? </p>
<p>I have written multiple scientific papers. I know what happens when you fail to mention limitations of your study/ information that goes against what you‚Äôre hypothesising/ what other respected (or even non respected) scientists have to say on the matter. Here‚Äôs what happens - your paper gets rejected. You must revise. </p>
<p>What has happened to science? And why are they ok with this? Are they aware and ignorant? Or do they just not know? If they DID know, would they change their perspective? </p>
<p>We need to do something about this. I‚Äôm not saying stop the vaccine rollout or stop the lockdowns or stop the masks or whatever else people are so obsessed with. It‚Äôs na√Øvet√© to think we can just get rid of these things now, they are embedded into our society. People depend on them. The vaccine obviously works in older individuals (provided the information we have been given on that isn‚Äôt fcking fake along with everything else). However, we NEED to stop censoring science. They need to see both sides of the argument. </p>
<p>As a scientist, I am in an extremely difficult position. I want to speak out about this but I can‚Äôt. I risk losing my job, my reputation, my whole future career. Hell, to be honest, it‚Äôs getting to the point where I feel like saying something would actually risk my life. </p>
<p>What the FUCK should I do?</p></p>

        <p>The vaccine doesn't work in the elderly and yes the information you've been given there is fake and cherry picked. It doesn't do jack except killing, maiming, sterilising and who knows what to come to people.</p>
<p>They are alright because it's a cult and cults don't work on reason.</p>
<p>You should look out for yourself and your family and start preparing.</p>

        <p>Wowowow, how do we know it sterilises? I agree, something is up here and I‚Äôll be surprised if it turns out not to be sinister in some way. But let‚Äôs still at least work with evidence here. Do you have evidence?? I have seen some alarming things such as women reporting changes to their menstrual cycle post-vacc, LNPs  from the vacc congregating in the gonads of female rats, some changes to sperm parameters post-vacc, and also a bit of scientific fraud on a paper regarding the vacc and miscarriage rates. You seen anything else?</p>

        <p>Well, those issues you mentioned pretty much make it a challenge to conceive, from either side. So while maybe not completely sterile (as of yet) - severely diminished reproductive ability is a risk worth noting and clearly enough to pull whatever's causing it, lest advocate for its use.</p>

        <p>Dr. Michael Yeadon and Dr Wodarg raised this concern in their petition to stop the vax.</p>
<p>https://www.wodarg.com/app/download/9033912514/Wodarg_Yeadon_EMA_Petition_Pfizer_Trial_FINAL_01DEC2020_signed_with_Exhibits_geschwa%CC%88rzt.pdf?t=1606870652</p>
<p>Michael Yeadon was the ex Chief Scientific Officer of Pfizer. </p>
<p>There's also a study on this sub somewhere whose results are intentionally misinterpreted by the people doing it, as they include 3rd trimester women in miscarriage rate (&lt;20 weeks as defined by them) which is impossible given that 3rd trimester is obviously beyond 20 weeks already. If one calculates then, it looks like an 82% miscarriage rate.</p>
<p>Also anecdotal stuff like this</p>

        <p>Forget science, this is about morale/ethics, and you will be always a selfish prick.
I tried to have scientific debates, but as soon as you prove to know more (about mortality by age, transmission, therapies, prevention, risk/benefit ratio, bioethics, etc), the conversation takes ALWAYS the morality turn.
It doesn't matter how much deadly is the virus for you, because there will always be a grandma somewhere.
Doesn't matter how safe is the vaccine approved for emergency use, because you'd be a hero if you die vaxxed</p>

        <p>It's crazy. Science has always had vested interested in it. People that know how to play the game and manipulate studies to fit their agenda.</p>
<p>At this stage all we can do is speak the language of the masses and educate them with surface level evidence - dumb it right down. Because the reputation of said 'conspiracies' have been brainwashed into them, they will get defensive and shut off completely. </p>
<p>It's your call if you want to risk your job, maybe reflect on what's really important to you.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm about to graduate and start my career as a scientist (hopefully). I‚Äôve loved science since I was a kid and knew it‚Äôs what I wanted to do, but recently I‚Äôm feeling much less excited to be in the field. Almost the whole science community is corrupted by politics, big pharma, and China. I refuse to censor the truth and I would rather live in the woods than be a part of whatever ‚Äòscience‚Äô is right now. Please, speak out. We will never defeat this if the honest people are too scared to say anything. If we let this authoritarian government win, losing our science careers will be the least of our worries.</p>
