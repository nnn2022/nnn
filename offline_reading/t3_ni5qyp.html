    <strong>What are the odds of dying from covid after passing by an anti masker in the cereal aisle of Walmart?</strong>
    <p><p>Disclaimer: A bunch of morons from r/covidiots and possibly some bots, have raided this post and downvoted the shit out of it. This post was at 25 upvotes and rising and is now at just 3. None of these idiots have tried to counter any of the points I've made. Please share. Nobody is doing the math and connecting the dots here. The virus is over no matter how you try to spin it. Spread the word.</p>
<p>At least 66.8% of the US population is immune to the virus. </p>
<p>How did I get this number? Simple. </p>
<p>US population: 328 million </p>
<p>Estimated number of covid infections according to the CDC: 114.5 million (34.9% of population)</p>
<p>Number of people who have received at least one dose of vaccine: 160 million. (48.8% of population) </p>
<p>Number of people unvaccinated: 168 million (51.2% of population)</p>
<p>If we assume an even distribution of infections between vaccinated and unvaccinated Americans, we can take the 34.9% number from the estimated infections data and apply it to the unvaccinated population.</p>
<p>0.349 x 168 million = ~59 million people who are unvaccinated but naturally immune. </p>
<p>160 million vaccinated + 59 million naturally immune = 219 million total immune population.  </p>
<p>That's 66.8% of the population </p>
<p>It's over folks. Walk down the street. Every 3rd person you pass has the potential to give you a virus if they happen to have it, you are in close contract with said individual for an extended period, and assuming you're not already in the 2/3 who are already immune. </p>
<p>Another way to think about it is this way: </p>
<p>You take 2 randomly selected people and put them in a room together. What are the odds that both of them are unvaccinated and haven't already already had covid? </p>
<p>Answer: one in six, or 16.7% (Let's round up to 17%)</p>
<p>Now what are the odds that one of the individuals has covid? If we use the positive test rate we'd get 3% currently. That number is skewed for a number of reasons but I can't find any better data so we'll just use it anyway. So that's about a 5% chance that at least one of them has covid. In this hypothetical situation let's say it's in a poor ventilated room and theres a 50% chance that if one of them has covid they will spread it to the other. </p>
<p>50% of 5% of 17% using this very generous assumption would be 0.43% chance. To reiterate, in this situation where you take two strangers off the side of the road, and put them in close quarters contact, the odds of one giving covid to the other is 0.43%. Less than 1 in 200. </p>
<p>So let's say this is you, you are not vaccinated and do not have or have had covid. We start the experiment by saying you have a one in three chance of being paired with someone who is not vaccinated. The odds that this person has covid, if they are unvaccinated, is 2.5%. The odds that you catch their covid if the event that they do have covid is 50%. </p>
<p>Your odds of getting covid from this interaction are 0.41%. </p>
<p>Let's say you got covid due to this experiment. Now that you have covid what are your odds of being hospitalized?</p>
<p>From the same CDC source I used previously in this post, 114.6 million Americans have been infected, and 5.6 million have been hospitalized according to CDC estimates. </p>
<p>4.886%, we'll round up to 5%. 5% is your risk of being hospitalized. One in twenty. Assuming you were assigned a random age and random cocktail of comorbiditys at the beginning of this experiment as well. </p>
<p>Your odds of being infected from the start, as a person who hasn't taken the vaccine, is 0.41% so your risk of being hospitalized from an intimate interaction with a random stranger is 5% of that which is 0.02%. </p>
<p>Your odds of death from covid infection is 0.5%. So again circling back to the hypothetical experiment, your odds of dying from covid due to an intimate close quarters interaction with a stranger is 0.002%. </p>
<p>So what are my odds of someone who's fully vaccinated dying due to an anti masker, anti vaxxer, who happens to have an asymptomatic case of covid, passing by them in the Walmart cereal aisle. Same calculation just divide by a million because the odds of dying of the virus post vaccine are one in a million.</p>
<p>Edit: I did the math in regards to the previous paragraph. If you're vaccinated, your odds of dying from covid due to a brief interaction with a stranger in Walmart is about 0.000000002%. That's one in 50 billion. So every non mask wearer you pass you're taking a one in 50 billion chance that you'll die. If that's not a risk you're willing to take, you need to reevaluate your risk tolerance.</p>
<p>No matter how many people you pass by the statistic is that your odds of dying of covid post vaccination are 1 in one million. </p>
<p>By the way your odds of dying in a lightening strike are one in 20,000. Quick maths: you are 50X more likely to die in a lightning strike than you are to die of covid post vaccine. So if you're vaccinated, you should also just zip it and let people decide what they want to do. Your risk is eliminated when you get vaccinated. </p>
<p>I'm sorry for the book people, but somebody had to quantify how stupid this all is. Media isn't doing it's job.</p>

        <p>| 5% is your risk of being hospitalized</p>
<p>And the vaccine makers say their shots are 85-90% effective... thatâ€™s a drop of at least 5%.</p>

        <p>Almost all of my calculations I used the most generous assumptions for and rounded up purposely to avoid the perception of cherry picking in any way. No matter how you spin it, there is no possible way to come to any other conclusion other than that the virus is over.</p>

        <p>wait this is a trick question.</p>
<p>the real answer is that it depends on how many cycles the pcr test runs.  if it's less than 30 cycles, the answer is zero, you have no chance of dying from covid if your pcr test is run at less than 30 cycles.</p>

        <p>Not a trick question. I said nothing about pcr tests. I used the CDCs estimated infections number as the baseline rather than the PCR tests numbers. I don't know man. Not trying to get into that whole side discussion.</p>

        <p>Just because you're vaccinated doesn't mean you can't be a carrier, you can transmit even if you are vaccinated it just means YOU don't get symptoms, that's why people on the UK who go abroad still have to self isolate when they get back even if they have been fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>Just because THEY are immune, doesn't mean you are.</p>
<p>The pandemic isn't over, but we are getting there, we just need to not let everything go to shit by relaxing early.</p>
