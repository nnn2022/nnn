    <strong>This whole situation seems like a bad nightmare: I just want to wake up.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a 17 yo guy. I'm ashamed to admit when a lockdown was first announced in my country I was excited about the idea of getting a rest from it all for a couple weeks then come back with more enthusiasm. </p>
<p>Then the two weeks turned into a 7 month long psychological torture.</p>
<p>I've always been an introvert but it was deep into quarantine that I realized I can't live without real life relationships. The internet is artificial. No one's real. I got very lonely and I couldn't tell anybody because everyone seems to conform and continue to live with their sad virtual lives.</p>
<p>Oh boy do I want to go back to how it all was. Today it all seems like a very bad joke. People buy anything the news tells them. My parents will tell me to sod off if I tell them to turn off TV and they keep on consuming from the lying media.</p>
<p>I'm afraid my few real life acquantaines will see me as a nutjob if I even begin to tell them about my opinion on the whole situation. I can't even speak up about my true thoughts. This has been taken too far.</p>
<p>The future seems so grim to me. I'm in senior year in high school and I can't cope with assisting only half of the days as a "safety measure". I ain't learning a thing and it's only my willpower keeping me going but it has its limits too.</p>
<p>The next year already seems to be a bad one right from the start: mask mandates will stick around for much longer, we just got an announcement that lockdown is pretty much imminent in my country and I can't bring myself to look for positivity among this whole situation.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell someone so I don't keep all this to myself. I hope you can find the hope I lack.</p></p>

        <p>we’re in a pretty similar situation, only difference is in 16 and it’s the start of my junior year. i felt like it was good to have 2-3 weeks to step back, play some video games and think about my life, but now i just feel like i’m losing my sanity day-by-day. i can’t stand playing video games anymore, i can’t just continue my Snapchat streaks and pretend it’s all okay, i can’t stand the monotony of doing the same shit everyday. my childhood is fucking ruined, i don’t have anything to look forward to or smile about.</p>
<p>i’ve lost 80% of my friend circle at this school and will likely never see them again because almost all of them were seniors that graduated.</p>
<p>as i’ve said before, i can’t say that we’re all in this together because the lockdown made sure that we’re not, but remember that you’re not alone in your struggles. regardless of what your parents say or what the TV says.</p>
<p>i used to think that maybe my ‘friends’ thought i was an asshole and everyone’s just having parties and getting into new relationships without me, but my friends have been living the same way.</p>
<p>this whole ordeal is depressing, i believe that if you can get through something like this without killing yourself or others, then there’s nothing on this planet that bring you down.</p>
<p>i wish you the best, man.</p>

<p>Problem is there is no future for a lot of us when these lockdowns are over. Job market is plummeted, everyone is going to date online, absolutely nothing to look forward to for months afterward.</p>
<p>Lot of us will be stuck at home for a long time.</p>

        <p>you either go crazy or let the world drive you crazy. either watch the world burn or catch on fire trying to save it. </p>
<p>i’m going to try to make the most of it and plan for my future.</p>
<p>as soon as i learn how to drive i’m going to spend most my hours out the house. </p>
<p>i fucking hate plastic online relationships, so if we go back to fully in-person school i already know a few girls i’m going to ask out.</p>
<p>i’ll work at a local restaurant since most old employees got laid off because of the lockdown.</p>
<p>i’m going to solely rely on myself and protecting my family, since the world has already proved that it can’t do shit for me.</p>
<p>as long as i have a girlfriend, a small part-time job and am able-bodied to protect the things i love, i’m set. that’s really all i want out of my life by the time i’m 18.</p>

        <p>Try not to lose hope.  That's exactly what "they" want, to have you so hopeless and broken that you'll accept whatever draconian, awful "solution" they have in store.</p>
<p>There's a quote from Aldous Huxley in Brave New World Revisited that I like and find very fitting today for all the people who accept the "new normal":</p>
<p>&rt;“The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does. They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted.”</p>
<p>Vent here.  We know you're not the one who is thinking irrationally in all of this.</p>

        <p>I sure can relate to how you feel eventhough I'm 35, I think most people feel the same way that you are. I at first was a bit fearful at the state of the world during the start not knowing what was what and having to work from home. But fast-forward to 7 months and still being at home, not being able to go places that I used to before and just being able to take a walk in the neighborhood to get fresh air and some exercise has been getting to me mentally. Quite honestly, I sympathize even more to what you've said about being in school, kids your age should be socializing with their peers, horsing around and having fun... not being healthy and having to lock away in their homes, over a "virus" that has a 99.7% recovery rate! I hope that you are doing okay, hanging in there and maybe pick up a hobby, something that you can work on. Pick up an instrument that you want to learn, a language that you want to learn or heck even pick up a programming language, so that when things do go back to normal you will possess a skill that will help you in life! I wish you the best and if you need an ear, you can message me!</p>

        <p>Pal, thank you for commenting. It's good to see someone else is going through hardship because some days it feels like it's only something happening to me. I would give anything to go back to how it was and now I see how wrong I was at the start.
I'm currently just doing schoolwork and studying, the current grade I'm in is very time consuming, so I have very little time for leisure, but I'll look into finding a new hobby or something like that.</p>
<p>I wish you the best! And again thank for commenting, I appreciate a lot.</p>

        <p>Absolutely! Hope I was able to help a little bit... may I ask, are you in the UK? I did read you mentioned about lockdowns and think that things were going to kick off there (if they haven't) even more severely. As you grow older and experience life, you will come to learn that life is not only about working but about doing things you enjoy and about experiences that will add brightness to your life</p>

        <p>Oh I'm not from the UK, I'm a spaniard, the thing here is the government got away with implementing a "state of alarm" until May the 9th, and the next step is them imposing lockdown, and I already see this becoming like the first time.</p>
<p>The way I put it it may seem like I don't take any time off 😅 but I'm a very relaxed guy, I usually procrastinate a lot between task and task, I know what you said is true and I appreciate you caring about the matter.</p>

        <p>Oh man I’m the same, 17 as well in Scotland in my final year of high school. I’m completely drained, I usually am in normal times but this situation has just made me apathetic towards most of life. I’m just waiting on Sturgeon announcing a full lockdown, but schools will remain open. My life will just be school and propaganda.</p>

        <p>Same here then. I usually am mentally tired, and this year it's gotten much worse.</p>
<p>I'm from Spain and all guys my age will just follow any orders they're given. Even I wear a mask and keep my distance, but I know it's awful, my peers don't seem to be too disgusted about the situation.
Some were straight up government boot lickers and when I was in Instagram near the beginning of quarantine (I left the app later down the road because I couldn't stand seeing the same stuff over and over) all I saw were people posting #stayhome all over their stories.
Even I was in support of masks and lockdown and all you can imagine to slow the spread of corona but it's all a joke at this point and our way of handling it has gotten out of hand.</p>

        <p>I fell out with a lot of “friends” over a, on my part, civil discussion over lockdowns and efficacy. This was in April too. This was on Instagram and I quickly became more self-dependant after realising that those whom I once respected would turn on me over a difference of opinion.</p>

        <p>I believe these confusing times brought out the true nature of people and after all it's good you're no longer around them if they're able to stop contact over this stuff. 
People have lost their minds, it's like no one's rational anymore.</p>
<p>I hope you can stay strong Jordan, and I wish you luck in the coming months.</p>

        <p>Yeah, these times seem to have unlocked and exposed a complete and utter dormant illogic in people, it’s a shame really cause it never had to get like this. It truly feels like the Twilight Zone.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your comment pal, I was always the one to watch news with my family during lunchtime and I wouldn't mind it but it's gotten ridiculous after the pandemic, it's fearmongering interrupted by awful advertisements and I've gotten sick of it all. </p>
<p>They even realise the media doesn't tell the truth but they keep on watching regardless of that. It's become an addiction to fear.</p>

        <p>I'm 18, also from Spain (though I live in Australia, hola!), in my final year of High School, and I feel you so much. </p>
<p>It's all like some sick, horrible nightmare, but it's <em>real,</em> and even now, almost eight months later, I <em>still</em> forget. I'm <em>still</em> surprised when I wake up in the morning and remember everything that has happened. It honestly still doesn't seem real. My mind still forgets briefly for a moment, still pretends. It still hits me every once in a while that <em>this isn't fiction -</em> this isn't a dystopian story that I've read or watched or imagined, it's <em>real life!</em> And it's terrifying! It's incomprehensible. I still can't believe it.</p>

        <p>Hola compañero :) 
I agree with you, it feels surreal and sometimes there's a brief moment in the morning right when I wake up and I don't remember the whole situation going on and I feel like I'm in peace, then I'm tormented by the thought of having lost almost a full year of my life to a silly virus with a 99.9+ survival rate and I can't help but get angry until my anger escalates into sadness, then a deep feeling of impotence because I can't do a thing and everyone seems to be brainwashed.</p>
<p>My trimester finals are coming up in less than 2 weeks and that isn't helping. School has been awful ever since March and now I'm only attending in person half of the days in a week and the others I stay at home staring at a computer screen for 8 hours. It's dehumanizing to say the least.</p>
<p>I really really really hope things get better for us both partner, and I hope you have a nice day.</p>
<p>Cuídate</p>

        <p>&rt; I can't help but get angry until my anger escalates into sadness, then a deep feeling of impotence because I can't do a thing and everyone seems to be brainwashed.</p>
<p>Yes, 100%. Furious anger replaced by a bitter sadness and despair that remains just there, even when I'm feeling momentarily happy. And it's been so horrible for Spain, even worse than here, I think. You're entering another lockdown now, aren't you? My grandmother was lucky enough to catch a flight from Galicia to Mallorca to stay with my family there for the foreseeable future, otherwise god knows how long she'd have been alone. </p>
<p>And here I was wanting to go live there this December for six/seven months! I'm still going to try to go, and they have to let me in as a citizen, surely (!?), but yeah. It's not looking good. </p>
<p>Mucha suerte for your trimester finals, and have a nice day also, my friend.</p>

        <p>Hi, I’m 15 and I’m feeling the way you are. My mom is a lot like your parents. At first I had kind of a weird feeling about the whole thing but went along with it as a nice break. I missed out on the end of my freshman year and now I’m missing out on my sophomore year, I feel bad for the seniors especially. This whole thing still doesn’t seem real to me. If you ever wanted to message me feel free 😊 good luck.</p>

        <p>I'm openly anti lockdown at work and home. All my friends know it, including one that advised Boris to lock us down again. People will only think you're a nutjob if you get hysterical or use hysterical phrasing.</p>
<p>This is why I decided to call myself a libertarian - freedom of people, freedom of the market. These two principles alone are anti lockdown. It's an easy logical step from that to being anti lockdown.</p>
<p>Now if you start calling masks "face suffocators" then yeah, you'll be branded a nutter. Don't come at this from a science angle as science is mostly right on the matter. But we aren't governed by science. Science is too slow and too focused to be used to govern a country. Sure you can accurately predict covid deaths but that says nothing about deaths from suicides, untreated patients avoiding hospitals, the economic downturn, etc. Furthermore it makes the value judgement implicitly that older lives are more valuable than younger ones and doesn't weigh up the relative life expectancy remaining for the average patient against those dying from suicide and poverty related conditions.</p>
<p>In other words; we've decided that giving a boomer another month to live matters more than a the 50 years lost of a 20 something suiciding over the lockdown.</p>
