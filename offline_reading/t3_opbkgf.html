    <strong>Someone I know supports vaccine passports because "it's just like how people aren't allowed to smoke in public spaces"</strong>
    <p><p>They stated that they don't see any problem with vaccine passports/health passes, and with restricting unvaccinated people's access to public spaces (like what is about to happen in France), because it's just like restricting people from smoking in public!</p>
<p>Their logic is that...</p>
<p>Second-hand smoke is harmful to other people. Smoking is banned in most public spaces/facilities because of this harm, as people's right to health/safety trumps the smoker's right to smoke/have bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>And so...</p>
<p>Being non-vaccinated is harmful to other people. Unvaccinated individuals should be banned from these public spaces, as people's right to health/safety is more important than people's bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>I've also been told that having vaccine passports for COVID-19 is just like how proof of vaccination was required for certain diseases like yellow fever back in the day in order to be able to travel, and so what's the big deal?</p>
<p>I - I can't. How am I supposed to counter such a ridiculous argument!? How could I possibly convince people that vaccine passports are abhorrent and should never <em>ever</em> be accepted (regardless of your personal stance on getting the vaccine), when <em>this</em> is their logic? </p>
<p>It's just so stupid that it's making me doubt myself. I feel like I'm going mad! </p></p>

        <p>Its simple:</p>

<p>"There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed cases who are truly asymptomatic, and <strong>to date, there has been no documented asymptomatic transmission</strong>. This does not exclude the possibility that it may occur."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What that means is if he wants to ban you from entering because you arent vaxxed but also have no symptoms, its the same as banning a smoker from entering even when he doesnt smoke.</p>
<p>Edit: But then again, they might just say: YEAH ban the smokers for life, because fuck smokers...</p>

        <p>I did try to go this route of telling them that <em>I'M NOT SICK</em> and that asymptomatic spread is basically nonexistent, but I think they're just too far gone. </p>
<p>It's so frustrating and depressing that the vast majority of the population can't see what's going on when it's literally <em>so obvious!!</em> The evidence is so overwhelming it makes me dizzy. How can people not see through all this bullshit! So, <em>so</em> many people don't seem to give a damn about people's freedoms, rights and bodily autonomy :(</p>

        <p>Yes, but even if COVID-19 had a 60% fatality rate, vaccine passports would <em>still</em> not be right. It's such a flagrant violation of human rights and freedoms. No government should ever have the power to take them away.</p>

        <p>The two situations are not nearly analogous. In the case of smoking, it can be clearly established that someone is engaging in a harmful activity, one that has effects on other people nearby (I doubt secondhand smoke is as dangerous as is thought, but let's assume it is for now). In a public space there is a reasonable expectation of some standard of safety. If someone was pouring gasoline into a can while holding a lit cigarette and there were people nearby, it would make sense for police to intervene, at least to clear bystanders away until the fool either combusts or finishes his task. A public policy disallowing handling gasoline in certain places makes sense and a necessary component is that one would consciously decide to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>But when talking about an infectious disease there is no reasonable standard of prevention that does not violate individual rights because it can never be reliably known who walking down the street is infected and who isn't, unless they're obviously exhibiting symptoms. In that case, natural human self-preservation behavior would be to avoid getting close to that person. As contrasted to the smoking or gasoline handling, harboring a virus is not done willingly and in many cases, the person may not even be aware that he or she is infected. They would not be intentionally exposing others to disease, most likely. To make a blanket policy that treats everyone as though they're infected is a presumption of guilt, in a sense, and public policy that operates on the principle of guilty until proven innocent is quite dystopic for a reason, it's immoral. </p>
<p>Also, as someone else here pointed out, the evidence of widespread asymptomatic transmission does not exist. If debating, I second the idea of demanding to see it.</p>
