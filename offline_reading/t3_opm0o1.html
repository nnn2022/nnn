    <strong>I stopped wearing a mask in the airport and no one confronted me about it</strong>
    <p><p>I flew from Tucson to Boston this week. Face masks are officially mandatory in the airport. I did not wear one except when I was boarding the plane. No one seemed to care that I was not wearing a mask (no glares, no eyerolls, nothing). I even had conversations with a couple of masked people and they were friendly and sociable, not confrontational like you’d expect. </p>
<p>The thing was, my family of three were the ONLY people not wearing masks (well, the only non-African American people...we’re white). I flew through Atlanta and there were several African American people not wearing them there (they were in Boston and Tucson)....perhaps they understand history and the nature of corruption and after Tuskegee are rightfully skeptical of authority and sensitive to propaganda. Who’s to say? It was only in Atlanta I saw this so I dont know what’s unique about Atlanta.</p>
<p>I am not intimidating at all (5’3, ~120 lbs) and HATE conflict to the point of panic. Before this went down I went out of my way to not break rules because of the concomitant anxiety it gave me. I realize now that this situation is not about a virus after all and all signs point to it being used to lay the groundwork for the establishment of a social credit score system. (Please listen to this podcast: https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2021/07/26-02-mu-podcast-the-panopticon/) </p>
<p>I don’t want to live under such a system; no good can come of it. I feel like other people who are aware of the creepy stuff going on have an obligation to get over their fear of conflict and go maskless as well. The walls are closing in fast (new facial recognition cameras going up in my neighborhood this week, as one example among a million more). Absolutely refuse to comply. I believe this is the only way to effectively fight back. Some people—what you guys would call “sheep”—can not understand that a small group of money hungry psychopaths control the media, $cience, corporations, tech, and gov’t. Until they realize this, they cannot believe that they are being lied to, perhaps because it is crazy to think such a coordinated effort toward tyranny is realistic. Maybe until they “wake up” to this and realize it is in their own best interest to not comply, we can do it ourselves en masse for THEIR benefit as well as our own. Just stop following orders. Good ol’ Civil Disobedience. Hell, if a former goody-two-shoes like me can swallow her fear and be the sole mask free among the masked, then I’ll bet you can too. </p>
<p>I talked to one guy with a mask who was also aware of all of this. He took the mask off after seeing me without it. Why was he wearing a mask to begin with? Because he thought he was going to be confronted over it? I wish more people would have courage and take the damn thing off, EVEN if it means confrontation.</p></p>

        <p>being confronted is a reason why a lot of people are wearing mask. I do not wear it if my gf is not with me, she doesn't want anyone to give us shit as I like conflicts</p>

        <p>I know people are scared of conflict, but I hope this post encourages others to get over that fear. I can do it and so can you! It’s not as scary as you’d think and there is too much at stake to give in to cowardice.</p>

        <p>same i don’t wear mine anymore in airports either and i feel so hot like i’m walking down a fucking runway the way everyone stares at me haha. i started doing it when i saw others were too! 
when the fed mandate was started tho my family got into a disagreement mid flight with a flight attendant about my sleeping brothers (age 12) mask falling off his nose. they announced over the speaker that someone was refusing to wear a mask which was a lie, it just kept slipping off his nose as he was asleep. the national guard met my family at the gate (my dad said they were wearing theirs under their noses) and gave them a verbal warning. it’s theater</p>

<p>You’re in the US? Hard to imagine the national guard showing up on my trip and it goes to show how quickly the dialogue is changing. Nice!</p>

        <p>Would you all look at this goober? Eminent economic collapse, broken supply chains and resulting mass starvation in the third world, millions out of work, on the brink of homelessness, constantly shifting goalposts on MSM, and the largest seizure of wealth by the upper class in history, installation of a surveillance state and /u/skyrimwithdrawal thinks our problem with masks correlates to not caring about other people. Just because you’ve been taken in by the propaganda doesn’t mean we have.  It’s okay, numbnuts, we’ll stand up for your own best interests before you even realize what the <em>real</em> nature of the problem is. (hint: it’s not about a virus!) Hopefully by the time you wake up to the fact you’ve been lied to by a hermetically sealed media, you won’t have a facial recognition camera perched on every street lamp and you still have freedom to criticize the gov’t. While we wait for you and others of a similar mindset to catch on, we’ll refuse to comply for EVERYONE’S best interest (yes, even yours!)</p>

<p>There's a pandemic. Hospitals were, for a while, flooded with people whose only crime was they went to work. More than 40 NYC MTA employees died in the first wave. More than 130 in all. https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/mta-unveils-video-tribute-to-colleagues-who-died-due-to-covid/ar-BB1d5ofo</p>
<p>Economic collapse was AVERTED by shutting things down so the ERs and ICUs could cope. You talk about keeping people working but the fact is, more of those workers would be dead if we followed your advice.</p>

        <p>99.7% 👏 survival 👏 rate 👏 is 👏 not 👏 a 👏 pandemic! Even considering the 2% case fatality rate, that percentage does not distinguish between people who died WITH vs FROM COVID. It also does not take into account the bullshit PCR tests which is likely to give false positives (with so many cycles, you can find evidence of ANYTHING! Hell even a papaya can and has tested positive!) It ALSO does not take into account all the asymptomatic patients who were never tested nor sought out medical care and just “got over it” (I am one of those and I have cystic fibrosis...)</p>
<p>The point being that that 2% case fatality rate is looking much closer to 0.03% than to 2% when you consider all those factors.</p>
<p>With numbers like that, it is clear there is NO pandemic, just a middling virus that affects mostly old and infirm people that are already on their way out (80+ years old). There is certainly no justification for the government over reach. </p>
<p>Even if you WERE right and there was a true pandemic, remember when they told us lockdown was just to flatten the curve? Well, I remember. And Australia is apparently in lockdown again over 30 cases!! Enough is enough is enough! No more compliance!</p>

        <p>&rt;99.7% 👏 survival 👏 rate 👏 is 👏 not 👏 a 👏 pandemic!</p>
<p>If it is clogging up the ERs, it 👏 is 👏 a 👏 pandemic. Do the math. In a country of 330,000,000 people, that is 990,000 fatalities. With millions of people in the hospital, cancer procedures don't happen. Operations don't happen. People who have emergencies don't get saved. THE ECONOMY GOES STONE AGE. Famine follows because food supply chains break down. Thankfully rates have slowed because many are listening and actually care about their fellow citizens. You may not, but most do.</p>

        <p>God, you’re so close to getting it but have missed the mark again! </p>
<p>The point is the curve has been flattened. If hospitals cannot handle 30 CASES (not even hospitalizations), then that’s utter incompetence on their part. </p>
<p>If you want to live in fear until disease is totally eradicated (utterly unrealistic!!) then go right ahead and rot indoors (I’m guessing you have a cushy job and can afford to WFM. Privilege that not everyone has...), but don’t expect anyone not indoctrinated by bullshit to go along with you. Your life is yours, and mine is mine.</p>
