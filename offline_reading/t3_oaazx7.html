        <p>You know what I have more to say..I am so sick of this media created divide going on, I am a California grown liberal who now lives in the southwest, I have plenty of disagreements with friends and people in the community but I still like and love them, I even understand there point of view because I actually listen, most people aren't racist, most people aren't homophobic, most people only give a shit about getting by and taking care of there family, I am also biracial, I've seen both sides talk shit, that's just how humans are, do we still have  problems, duh, but I swear if people don't stop this tribalism bullshit, we are all doomed, for fuc*s sake, stop this massive gaslighting on people who are hurt...jeeeez</p>

        <p>I miss the conversations with people i didn't agree with, good little back and forth over a good meal or a few drinks, everyone learns a little, and then all leave still friends. It's how you build respect and perspective.</p>

        <p>The state is blue, my town is red, and no I didn't vote, didn't like my choices, I personally thought the last election was horseshit, I don't like biden, I don't like trump, there both gross in my opinion, but regardless to how I feel about trump I didn't like the games the dems were playing to win, nor the way they shut down any other candidates, they used this pandemic to win, they screwed people with shutdowns in order to make him look bad, its clear as day, and then both party's dangled a measly sum of money like it makes up for killing jobs, they all suck, there all corrupt imo.</p>

        <p>The media works for Big Pharma. That‚Äôs why the attack on anything that would dare endanger the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù rackets.</p>
<p>I also believe there‚Äôs a eugenics angle which may be more elusive to prove. Although, SV40 contaminated Salk polio vaccines knowingly given to tens of millions can demonstrate both racketeering and eugenics.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know how it is that anyone trusts Big Pharma after SV40, Swine Flu ‚Äò76 scam, Vioxx, the opioid crisis and many other heinous crimes. Pharma is a criminal enterprise that sprang forth from the insanely corrupt German Dye Trust and Rockefeller‚Äôs Standard Oil that backed Hitler.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs upsetting that people always bend the knee to criminal Big Pharma complex and their captured agencies regarding any of their ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù.  </p>
<p>Folks play right into the Pharma propaganda by announcing ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not anti-vaxx‚Äù etc. </p>
<p>PSA: That‚Äôs a narrative set up by Pharma so we don‚Äôt properly frame the debate as: us the people vs criminal Pharma and their corrupt $cience.</p>
