    <strong>Can't take this anymore :( could use some support</strong>
    <p><p>throwaway acct to (hopefully somehwat) protect my identity. Also apologies in advance if this is all over the place.</p>
<p>I'm really not sure how much more of this I can take. The security/sanitization theater, the fact that this is destroying my mental health, and I feel like I can't really get help because too many have drank the kool aid. It does not help at all that I am in one of the strictest states.</p>
<p>I just sent my son (9) to his first day of school since March, and while I'm happy he's back in the building, I feel terrible that it's such a watered down experience. He has to wear a mask pretty much all day (except for "mask breaks") and he can no longer wear a bandana but must wear a cloth mask. It boggles my mind that kids are required to wear masks at their desks even though the desks are 6 feet apart. He can't have lunch with his friends but needs to stay at his desk. I made sure to discuss everything with him and he said he still wants to go to school. I suppose something is better than nothing but it's still super depressing. The parent body leans heavily toward doomers.</p>
<p>I'm also over everything needing to be sanitized over and over. Our immune systems NEED things to not be so pristine. I'm about the opposite of a germophobe.</p>
<p>I'm really not sure I can emotionally handle if distance learning returns. I do not make a lot of money and make a great deal of sacrifices so that my son can go to a private school. March/April were dark times for me and I thought about suicide daily. I honestly feel traumatized by everything that happened but no one who cared about mental health in 2019 cares now. </p>
<p>I wanted to take a class so that I can finally get a degree, but I am worried it will be too much with the ever present looming of my son's school being cancelled and the fact that I am shouldering almost all the household responsibilities as I lost my job in March and my SO is working full time. I did get a new job and I am happy there but it is only two days a week.</p>
<p>I lost a bunch of friendships because of differing opinions over the lockdowns. I couldn't deal with the doomers /hypochondriacs in my friend group. I am a very extroverted person and thrive on social interactions so having all that taken away was also very upsetting.</p>
<p>I just needed somewhere to vent. I no longer have a therapist as my last session with them left me feeling more hopeless than when I started the session and I might break if I put myself out there again just to find another dud of a therapist. I'm shaking as I type this right now. I am just so angry and traumatized. I vehemently oppose the lockdowns and new normal. I needed to post this to know it's being read by people I can relate to. I was already at a crossroads in my life before this and this is making life almost unbearable right now :(</p>
<p>TLDR: I'm not sure how much more of this I can take.</p></p>

        <p>I feel you.</p>
<p>I don’t have kids and I don’t know how any parent that isn’t a doomer is doing it right now. To watch so many people think it’s ok to quite literally destroy an entire generation worse than any has ever been destroyed is just unfathomable. It’s worse than unfathomable but I’m not sure of a better synonym. </p>
<p>During wars, our citizens were united and empowered. Now it feels like the opposite. Don’t be empowered. Don’t seek to win against anything. Just be afraid, cower, give up everything worth being alive for just to survive for this hellscape. That people think this is a life worth living for now is incredible to me. </p>
<p>No one thinks ahead or plans anymore. This has been abundantly clear. What do we do when an entire generation of kids save for a few are terrified of every other person and existing in society? How do you even raise or educate such a terrified population? No one thinks this through. It’s all about passing the buck, it’s all just going to be “someone else’s problem” when their kids can’t even walk down the street without having a panic attack. </p>
<p>I can’t stop thinking about 2 of my closest friends and how they went from being 2 of the most social people I’ve ever met to not leaving their house except for drives and the store for the past 6 months. Their daughter who was born in March has never seen another human being except for her 2 parents. The 2 most social people I know are raising a daughter that will have such unimaginable social stunting. It makes my chest ache to even think about it. I was going to be in this kid’s life. We were going to go everywhere with her. Now I am convinced I should just probably mourn those friends and count my losses because they seem to be irreparably lost to this. It’s devastating. It’s soul crushing. My soul is crushed from this.</p>
<p>I’m so very sorry for you and for everyone who knows how wrong this is but we are lost in a sea of people who have let fear stamp out all other signs of life. You’re allowed to vent here. I think you’re in very good company. Please stay strong so you can raise your son with love and without fear. I believe in you!</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for your kind words. And I am so sorry that your soul has been crushed and you haven't been able to have a relationship with your friend's daughter yet. It is so disappointing to think about "what could have been" :( </p>

        <p>Same boat here with kids in school. Reach out privately if you'd like to chat... it's hard. I contemplated pulling them out of school and traveling the country in an RV to just experience the world and let them learn that way... They want to be with their friends though.</p>

        <p>Thanks so much. I spent a lot of April/May dreaming of getting away and seeing the national parks. Unfortunately fear held me back- not of the virus but that I'd get there and still feel sad. Also not knowing what was going to happen or if I was getting my job back. My finances were also precarious as my son's tuition was due July 1st.</p>
<p>One cool thing I did was send my son to sleepaway camp. The one he usually goes to was not allowed to open (also devestating as it was my childhood camp), so I spend HOURS trying to find a camp that was open in another state. It was 4.5 hours away but it was worth it for him to be in the woods doing normal camp stuff.</p>

        <p>You are NOT alone. This is horrible. I have three kids doing online “learning” right now and it is depressing. However- the idea of what their day will look like when school DOES open is almost as bad (masks all day etc). Mine also say they want to go, so I will send them and let them try. </p>
<p>Like you- most of the people I know are doomers and that is the worst part for me. People I previously thought so well of...and now they have turned absolutely crazy...and worse- they are forcibly inflicting this on my children!! It gets me down. I do have a few friends who disagree with this, and that helps a lot. </p>
<p>Hang in there. In my opinion, things will start to turn around after the election (regardless of who wins). This has become political, and once the election is over, reality will set in. This is unsustainable.</p>

        <p>So many of us here feel you. I feel you. You are not alone in your pain, and anger. Yesterday was probably my worst day since it started. I have bright spots where I feel like it’s going to be okay, then I nose dive again. </p>
<p>Let’s ride this out, okay? For a little while at least. Let’s see where it goes before we do anything drastic. Let’s see how we feel at, say, Halloween, and re-evaluate then. </p>
<p>Being in a high compliance state can make you feel crazy. It can make you feel like the protagonist is an awful dystopian sci-fi movie where you’re the only one who can see what’s going on everyone else is a drone. But you aren’t the only one - we see it. There are THOUSANDS of us. We see it!</p>
<p>Yes - please don’t see a therapist if they will push you over the edge with their own agenda. That’s wise.</p>
<p>Walking 20 mins a day no matter what, which I started last month, has had a protective effect on my mental health. It’s not a magic bullet. But when you’re just trying to stop yourself from making a plan to self-harm, heck yes it can be a literal life saver. Please try that for a week and see if it helps? Just as an experiment.</p>

        <p>thank you for your message. I appreciate you mentioning Halloween. I always make my son's costume (not hand sewn, more like crafting/putting things together) and this year he wants to be Link from the Zelda games. One thing I can work on that has nothing to do w current events. Last year there was a horrible windstorm and we still went trick or treating- as long as people are answering their doors we plan to do the same!</p>

        <p>Yay! Little goals, just a little ways out, and keep trucking. </p>
<p>I’ve always struggled with depression, but never with suicidal thoughts like I’ve experienced in the past few months. This reddit sub has helped save me, in part. I was searching for critical voices against the lockdowns by looking for mainstream media editorials (haha, that sounds crazy now, but I’ve never really had “fringe” ideas and most of my beliefs have always been represented somewhere in the media!) and I got to thinking I was really crazy - I’d lost my mind, and it was all over. Then my boyfriend was like, “oh no there are lots of people who think this is bogus, go on reddit!“ 🙂</p>
<p>Anyway, I use the same techniques for dealing with thoughts of self-harm (which are new to me) as I do for my extra-dark moods. Speak them out loud to people who love and support me; do “experiments” (like walking) out of mere curiosity to see if things make feel better but with no expectation that they will or won’t; and most importantly just make plans to wait to see if I feel better or if the situation changes in a short number of days. Because things always change. Sometimes for the better.</p>
<p>Halloween is my favorite holiday, which is saying something because I adore all holidays. My mom always made me the baddest ass Halloween costumes and it’s one of my most cherished childhood memories. I know your son’s costume will rock! Got get ‘em!</p>

        <p>It is really hard.  The only thing I have to offer is that there have been days when it felt truly unbearable but the next day is better or the day after that.  I don't think it's offering false hope to remind you that terrible things do end.  Find whatever little thing there is that makes you feel better when this is getting to you and cling to it.  Look for anything that is getting better where you are and imagine building on that.  If you can't find anything than fantasize about moving to a place where things are getting better.  I think fantasy can be helpful in a time like this.  Imagine moving to Sweden if it helps.  Imagine moving to South Dakota.  You don't have to do it, just find an idea that makes you feel good and dwell in that for a few hours.  If it helps to feel angry and spiteful at the people making these decisions do that!  :) Do whatever you need to do to get through this.</p>

        <p>Sweetie you are not alone. There are many of us that feel the same as you and it’s growing each day. My mom was telling me about a couple prolockdown/promask friends that are finally getting sick of this shit and want to return to normal. 
Please hang in there...this will end. Just have faith.</p>

        <p>Your son and SO need you, but I guess that's hard to hear when you're struggling so much yourself.</p>
<p>Sorry you had a dud of a therapist too.</p>
<p>But you're among people here who understand what you're feeling, we all feel the same in different ways and for a variety of reasons, and we get it.  Well I do anyway. Hold on, we can get through this, the craziness just has to end sometime!</p>

        <p>I feel you. I don’t have kids but I’m so sad for them. I realized today it’s two months exactly til the election. (Assuming you’re in the US) This is the date I’ve been holding onto as a return to normalcy. I don’t want to wait two more months to be disappointed but I think regardless of the outcome our “leaders” won’t have to pander to their electorate anymore and I hope that will allow them to have some common sense. 
I teach adults and I cry everyday because no matter how hard I try I can’t do my job properly.</p>

        <p>I hate it for you. I’m sorry you’re going through this. Right now your son needs you.  More than anything else. You are his world.   I don’t know where you live, but there’s got to be things to do to get out there.  Go for a hike, don’t wear masks unless asked to.   Smile and be polite to people.  If they give you shit, just smile and tell them to have a nice day.  </p>
<p>If it makes you feel better, this will all likely go away come November.</p>

        <p>I really appreciate your comment. There are certainly tons of beautiful natural places to go, and I really should make more of an effort to get out. I took my son and his friend hiking at a gorge/creek, and it was so refreshing seeing NO ONE wearing masks. </p>
<p>I think I have just felt so sad/demoralized, I haven't really wanted to go anywhere or do anything :(</p>

        <p>we have 4 kids, three of which are in online school, Looking for a partial return starting on the 14th. (thank god). My wife has been a trooper as she has had to take the brunt of it, as I am working from home. I have projects. I write a blog, do youtube videos, and bought myself a new project car. They let me exercise my mind, my creativity, and my body.   </p>
<p>The hardest part for me is the denial of facts, and the virtue signaling. I no longer talk to co workers about anything outside of work specific topics, deleted facebook off my phone, etc. I'm done with every conversation revolving around covid... If you're in AZ at all, you're welcome to come turn a wrench with me.</p>

        <p>First of all: those thoughts that keep telling you “what if this happens” are lies you tell yourself and are not true. Nobody knows, and neither will you. But if it does, no biggie, you’ll handle it if it happens. </p>
<p>Secondly, allow your son to live as he wants. Just make sure he is able to let you know if he doesn’t wanna go, or communicate. If he’s not depressed about it, it’s not your responsibility to be. </p>
<p>Third, those were never your friends. Friends differ and argue, but it means nothing. Friendships outlast petty arguments. If they want to go, let them. There’s a non-masker or two you’ll find in your daily life - shoot your shot see what’s up with them. </p>
<p>Finally, calm down and live your life. Dude who cares? Focus on bringing in money someway, however you do it, find things that bring you fun after, and most of all stop listening to the lies you keep telling yourself in your head.</p>
