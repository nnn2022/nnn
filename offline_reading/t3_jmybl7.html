    <strong>Anyone else have hypocritical family/friends?</strong>
    <p><p>Back in august my family berated me over FB because I said that wearing a mask doesn’t automatically make you a good person. 3 different family members cussed me out, said I was ignorant, and literally threatened me with violence if I saw my grandmother and risked exposing her to COVID. </p>
<p>Now, I’m on FB and 2 of the family members post a picture of themselves at parties without masks on! When I confronted them, it was all back to “no! Masks should be worn everywhere and you’re still ignorant!”    </p>
<p>Anyone else coming across situations like this that just make you go “????????!?!?!??!?”</p></p>

        <p>Yeppp </p>
<p>And to top it all off they said "theirs no evidence that the BLM protest led to a rise in virus" </p>
<p>But they thought the anti lockdown was gonna rise exponentially but didn't rise, their logic doesn't apply to all mass gatherings, also shows how much mind control and influence the mainstream media has in people head</p>

        <p>I experienced mask bias in the work place. Crazy old guy out of nowhere screams like a chimpanzee after I passed behind his area without a mask..."IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THIS ROUTE YOU COULD ATLEAST WEAR A FU*KIN# MASK!" he roared out (scaring the shit out of me). I see the same guy later smiling and prancing around one of the managers who had no mask on with their faces so close they were practically making out. That's when I realised that mask rules only apply to entry level scum like me...been telling this story ever since.</p>

        <p>Yes. The most vocal pro-lockdown and pro-maskers I know (who are also the most critical of anyone who disagrees) are frequently getting together with lots of different people.</p>
<p>Reading between the lines, it seems they just don't want you to have a life because it makes them feel safe.</p>

        <p>My sister in the past few years has gone from a hardcore Trump supporter to a literal NPC liberal. Not sure how the F it happened, but the latest hypocritical thing she stated the other day was about how Armenians are protesting in and around the area where she lives (Los Angeles, CA) but yet she was nothing but supportive about the BLM protests that happened for literal months on end.</p>
<p>Absolutely delusional</p>

        <p>I've friends and family members asking me all the time if I remembered wearing the mask. They're very pro mask and pro lockdown. They use emotional strategy quite often. What about the grandmas?</p>
<p>Some of them drives without seat belts and eat fast food, but is very concerned about COVID19. After the mask mandate came, none of them wore a mask in the grocery store because of none else did. So, the grocery store was basically full of pro mask people without masks. Probably 50% were pro mask and pro restriction people.</p>
<p>I've seen them wash groceries religiously, not leaving their homes except for work and shopping, lecturing about masks, stranger danger and how dangerous the virus are despite it not being Ebola. Some of them are masked sometimes. But there are some people I've never seen masked during the 8 months so far despite being extremely pro mask.</p>

        <p>Just experienced this over the weekend at figure skating. A woman who asked me last Wednesday “Where is your mask?” and gave me a speech about how she needs to wear one “for (her) dad” showed up on Saturday to practice and told me that she was waiting on a test result and couldn’t take her mask off. Funny how it’s not OK for me to skate without a mask, but it’s OK for her to not be in quarantine and go to “non essential” places. Because she’s “pretty sure” she was negative. Someone who talks big about how worried she is about her dad sure has no problem playing “rules for thee but not for me.”</p>

        <p>Was excluded from my family’s Halloween (parents, 2 adult siblings and their families.) They were social distancing from me because I had attended a memorial service the weekend before that was held mostly outdoors with masks on. What they did for Halloween: attended a PARADE my sister’s neighborhood organized for all the kids.</p>
