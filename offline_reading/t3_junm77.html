    <strong>Message versus reality</strong>
    <p><p>Imagine there were constant stories in the media and the internet about cookers catching fire and cookers are very dangerous. The government passes a law that cookers can’t be used until they have been repaired. Despite being constantly bombarded with the message that cookers are catching fire nobody knows of any instance where a cooker has caught fire. The fire brigade has no records of having to attend fires caused by cookers. What the media, the internet and the government tells people about cookers doesn’t match reality. </p>
<p>Do you feel the above is similar to what is happening with Covid. We are constantly bombarded with message are in a deady pandemic by the media, the internet and the government but I see no signs of this pandemic. I don’t see huge numbers of people dying, surviving but falling severely ill, staff being absent from where I work, organizations being short staff due to staff having to take time off work or even dying. For instance, I don’t see shops having to close due to lack of staff. I constantly hear from people they don’t know anyone with covid. Do you feel the pandemic only exists in the media and the internet and doesn’t exist in the real world.  How can a supposedly deadly pandemic after eight months stay completely hidden?</p></p>

        <p>I personally know people who have gotten sick and have recovered. I also personally know three people who have died from it; however, 2 of them had pre-existing health conditions (70-year-old with a double lung transplant because of cancer in the last 5-10 years; 60-year-old with liver disease and retaining fluid over the last 5 years). The one outlier was a guy in his early 30s who died in late March/early April. He had asthma but wasn’t severe enough to be treated daily with meds but he was put on a ventilator almost immediately. I’m not saying that contributed to his death, but I know that medical professionals are now using ventilators as more of a last resort than the first line of treatment. </p>
<p>Anyway, all that to say...I do believe the media and politicians are absolutely hyping it up. Then we have very high-anxiety people—who thrive off of this kind of information—who just parrot what they’ve heard on t.v. and don’t really take the time to research or ask questions. (But then also refuse to listen to anyone else because they like the drama.)</p>
<p>Is it a real disease? Yes. Is it going to go away because of wearing masks, social distancing, and getting a vaccine? No. Are lockdowns helpful? In my opinion, no, simply because of the negative effects on people’s overall mental health and the economy. I’m more afraid of the lockdowns than I am of the virus, simply because I know how it would effect my little family if our state/county/city implements another one. Thankfully, I’m in the South, so I’m hoping our rebellious spirit (often interpreted as stupid, but I disagree in this situation) keeps that from happening.</p>

        <p>Don't forget that the firefighters have been laid off because there's so little work for them. </p>
<p>If this pandemic was truly dangerous, all the medical staff that provides routine ("non-essential") care would be performing triage in all those temporary hospitals that were built and are full of overflow patients.</p>
