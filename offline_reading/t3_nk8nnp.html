        <p>Tell me what other illness - flu, virus, etc - kills 590K people in a year with or without comorbidities? Death rate in USA is \~2%. Feel free to keep it circulating, tho, as I'm ready for whatever the unvaccinated will bring thanks to SCIENCE.</p>

        <p>None. They changed the method of reporting specifically for covid. They changed it so that anyone who died and had covid was considered a covid death. They sometimes ran multiple tests to get a positive and offered a big financial incentive to the hospitals and families if it "was" covid.</p>
<p>They are currently paying for funerals if it was covid, but won't even investigate a vaccine related death.</p>
<p>As for a death rate of 2%, you are dreaming. Even the IMHE with is intensely pro-covid says that 24% of the global population has had covid.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthdata.org/covid/video/insights-ihmes-latest-covid-19-model-run">http://www.healthdata.org/covid/video/insights-ihmes-latest-covid-19-model-run</a></p>
<p>\&rt;Cases globally are declining but mortality is stagnant. Still, the detection rate of COVID-19 infections is very low, about 7% globally. Based on the seroprevalence surveys that we track at IHME, we estimate about 24% of the public have been infected, so it means that many people are still susceptible out there.</p>
<p>They say it as a scare tactic, but other sources have come to similar numbers:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/20-265892/en/">https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/20-265892/en/</a>\&rt;Most of the studies are from locations with overall COVID-19 mortality rates that are higher than the global average. The inferred median infection fatality rate in locations with a COVID-19 mortality rate lower than the global average is low (0.09%). If one could sample equally from all locations globally, the median infection fatality rate might even be substantially lower than the 0.23% observed in my analysis.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768536/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768536/</a>\&rt;Conclusions: All systematic evaluations of seroprevalence data converge that SARS-CoV-2 infection is widely spread globally. Acknowledging residual uncertainties, the available evidence suggests average global IFR of \~0.15% and \~1.5-2.0 billion infections by February 2021 with substantial differences in IFR and in infection spread across continents, countries and locations.</p>
<p>The IFR of 0.15%, which has been declining, includes all the people who died with covid and not just from it. Even with comorbidities, this is 1/13th the death rate you just proposed.</p>
<p>You're welcome for the science, hombre.</p>
