    <strong>Serious question regarding the Great Reset</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve got a pretty solid idea of what it is. But my question is, if/when? Do you think it’ll ever hit us? And if so, any time estimates? This fall/winter? Earlier? Later?</p>
<p>(To the trolls: No I am not a conspiracy theorist. No I am not a person that believes the world will end. This is a genuine question and I was looking for <em>helpful</em> answers, not ones that demonize this sub.)</p></p>

        <p>It already is.  Forced lock downs, "papers please" currency debasement + forced economic shutdown, getting the normies all chimped out against the other side, subverted democracy, subverted (compulsory)  government schooling, subverted art and media, propaganda 24/7 in lieu of information.</p>
<p>The only light of the last 50 years (the original internet) is dying day by day.  All the bright spots where you used to find other actual thinking humans to talk to are destroyed or subverted from within.</p>
<p>While all this has been going on, trillions have been looted from the remaining productive countries to feed the parasitic manager class.</p>
<p>There is no big event.  The Enemy is actually capable of long term planning, something brainwashed out of most of us in school.  They will just keep slowly turning up the heat, manipulating the idiots they churn out of their education complexes and ramping up the control and deprivation.</p>

        <p>While I wholeheartedly agree, I was just thinking specifically about when they really “turn up the heat”. I have a feeling that later this year/in a few years, things are going to get much worse. But yeah, I realize that it is a process and your description is certainly accurate.</p>

        <p>I'm thinking either this fall, or next fall.  They may need to do a final lockdown season to completely ruin the economy.  The elite are already buying huge chunks of land and realestate with 5% down payments, then when hyperinflation goes crazy, they will pay off the remaining 95% which would be pennies in todays currency.  This will also price regular people out of housing at the same time since wages won't go up to match inflation.  If you don't have investments or real estate now, you're fucked.</p>

        <p>What do you think think will "happen"?  The Great Reset is an agenda with many moving parts that will roll out over the next years until, it seems, 2030.</p>
<p>One of the things that you realize as you get older is that you rarely recognize "history" as you live through it.</p>
<p>What would you imagine "the big one" would look like?</p>

        <p>I’m not quite sure, though the whole “cyber pandemic” certainly catches my attention. I think that, assuming most things shut down, it won’t be too long until the “elites” (parasites) offer their magical “solution” to get the public to comply... I know that sounds a bit far fetched lol... sorry if I sound crazy.</p>

        <p>The World Economic Forum has said a cyberpandemic is inevitable. They are conducting a staged supply chain attack simulation July 9. This is a yearly event but given the recent cyberattacks I believe this is a taste of what is to come. We haven’t had a true cyberattack that shuts everything down and I’m amazed it hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p>The Great Reset isn’t going to happen overnight. It is a slow process eroding personal freedom much like a cancer. You’ll know it is in the endgame when the lights go out.</p>

<p>While this whole CV-1984 operation has multiple goals (e.g. depopulation, sterilization of populace, Pharma profits, shift of work and commerce to online), a very important one that is not widely known or discussed is the need to get (ideally!) everyone on the planet outfitted with a unique virtual ID so they can become enrolled in all the new PPP (Public-Private Partnership) schemes the killionaires/investment bankers et al. have cooked up to keep the profits flowing (known variously as social impact bonds, Pay for Success Financing, etc.) and to manage all the people thrown into (even greater) poverty by the crashed economy (which was already happening, but will be blamed on COVID). While the predators creating these progams (all enabled by AI, blockchain ID and Etherium smart contracts) will be taking a cut of these lower-cost social services they will be partnering with governments to deliver, the real money is going to be in the derivative markets based on these (yes, the same man who came up with the CDO – Collateralized Debt Obligation – for mortgages back in the 00s, and which led to the financial crisis then, has now developed a related product involving these social impact bonds).</p>
<p>Looked at with all this in mind, the reason they want everyone vaccinated is so that everyone will have a unique digital ID (via the "health passport") so that soon after they crash the economy, they can roll out the new programs to keep the (now entirely digital) money flowing. Now that a substantial portion of the population is vaccinated (though far less than I'm sure they were hoping for by this point), and with Cyber Polygon coming up in July, I would guess that Fall 21 (when the vaccinated start dying in much larger numbers due to pathogenic priming as they come into contact with coronaviruses in the new cold/flu season, but deaths will be blamed on new variants, not on the vaccine itself) is when they will press that "reset" button and take everything down. Not that the Great Reset is an event taking place on a certain date, but that will be when the next signifcant catalyzing event in the operation occurs.</p>

        <p>Wow! Thanks for the long and detailed explanation... but are you sure that they’re going to hit the “reset” <em>after</em> most people are vaccinated? I was thinking more so that they would try taking more steps toward the edge of the cliff to coerce more people into taking it...</p>

        <p>Well, I can't be sure of anything, so don't bet all your money on the reset (as a more localized-in-time event) happening in October-November. They certainly may use the media focus on all the Autumn deaths "due to Variant of Doom X" to – one way or another – coerce all the remaining unvaxxed to get the jab, and only after that hit the button. But I would be surprised if it hasn't happened before 2022 rolls around.</p>

        <p>Probably just a personal bias(/intuition?) of some sort: I'm actually surprised we've come this far (I assume you're aware of the financial instability resurfacing in Sept. 2019; how long can they keep the thing going?!). Oh, I should also mention that if the reports of people becoming magnetized and WHY this is happening go viral*, and people stop gettting their shots as a result, they may decide to pull the plug early. I don't think it's already set in stone.</p>

        <p>A "conspiracy theorist" is by definition to theorise about conspiracies that are taking place. We're all conspiracy theorists and that's a good thing. </p>
<p>As to your question, look at the document "absolute zero". "Ice Age Farmer" on youtube does a wonderful job of breaking it down. There's your answer.</p>

        <p>This was formally known as Agenda 21, Some thought it meant for the 21st century, but seems like it's the actual year. Covid was the beginning. </p>
<p>Yes it's begun but we haven't seen the full implementation. That will include a social credit score that's linked to your money. So if you say something they don't like online, you will have real life consequences. Carbon tax for all normal activities. Food rationing with little to no meat (maybe some insect protein). No ownership of anything. Give up parental rights. There will definitely be some kind of eugenics involved. You'll probably need a license to reproduce and will probably have to die at a certain age. </p>
<p>As you can see, it can get much worse.</p>
