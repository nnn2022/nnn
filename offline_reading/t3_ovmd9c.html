    <strong>The exhilaration of being a doomer</strong>
    <p><p>We speculate a lot on why doomers are the way they are.  Clearly, there are a plethora of reasons.  One in particular though, one that you will notice if you look carefully, is the exhilaration they experience from wielding power, even tiny bits of it.  </p>
<p>Right now, they are getting hard-ons just thinking about forcing a vaccine on you.  You might wonder why that is.  Because many of these doomers have been powerless most of their lives.  Many of them are the socially maladapted types from childhood who now harbor deep resentment towards the rest of society.  For many of them, this is their revenge against the normal people who bullied and excluded them.  </p>
<p>They absolutely hate your smiling face, your glow of happiness, the thing they never had themselves.  And so they must put a mask over your face, so its pleasant appearance no longer offends their cynical gaze.  </p>
<p>They hate your ability to walk confidently into a crowded room and strike up conversations.  And so they must shut down social gatherings, lest the vibrant hum of conversation and laughter invade their darkened little world.  </p>
<p>They hate your successful business, the prosperity it affords you, and the interesting life it allows you to lead.  And so they must shut it down, and watch with glee as your success evaporates along with your comfort and ease. </p>
<p>They absolutely hate your healthy, strong body.  And so they must see it injected with highly experimental, questionable substances that may kill or maim you.</p>
<p>Ironic, since these are the same people who always claim to be motivated by a love for society and humanity.  In reality, they despise society and want to see it mangled.  They want everyone to be like them - miserable and desperate.</p></p>

        <p>I honestly think you are on to something here.  If I might add. </p>
<p>Many of these people depend on government/current society for existence.  The are what I would call incompetent.  In that they could not earn a living or exist without some aid.  They despise the competent.  Those who could quit a job and start their own business.  Those who could repair a leaky pipe if necessary.  Those who, because they do have some small amount of competence, exude a small measure of self assurance.  Lacking that, they hate it.  I tire of the analogies with Weimar Germany (although there are many).  But many other places have used the demonization of a group as a step to power.</p>
