    <strong>I knew before Covid that I lived in a culture of idiocy...but we have reached levels of idiocy that are beyond my belief</strong>
    <p><p>I was reading <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/08/04/anti-vaxxers-pretend-to-be-vegan-to-avoid-potential-vaccine-in-the-workplace">this article</a> today. It's about how veganism may prevent you from having to be vaccinated in a job due to employment legislation.</p>
<p>Within this article, Dr Julia Baines, science policy adviser and author at PETA UK, who I presume is vegan, wrote an 'insightful' and 'brilliant' passage on why she has been vaccinated, despite being a major figure in an organisation committed to ending animal testing.</p>
<p>In this passage, she said the following:</p>
<p>&rt;The goal of being vegan and advocating for animal rights is to bring about positive changes for animals. As long as tests on animals are a legal requirement, <strong>refusing to take a medicine on ethical grounds will not help the animals who have already been used in tests or spare any the same fate in the future.</strong></p>
<p>Great, Dr. Barnes. Thanks for your thoughts. Did you get your doctorate in a packet of cornflakes?</p>
<p>Why don't you eat meat then? Refusing to eat meat on medical or ethical grounds will not help the animals who have already been domesticated or slaughtered, or spare any the same fate in the future.</p>
<p>The whole point of ethical veganism or vegetarianism (I am vegetarian BTW) is that you refrain from participating in something that you deem to be corrupt. No-one stops eating bacon sandwiches because they believe that pig farming will crumble overnight. </p>
<p>I stopped eating meat because I love my dog, and I felt it was hypocritical of me to eat other mammals, when I would hate to see her mistreated. My decision literally has zero impact on anything. I just did it because I felt morally it was the right thing for me to do, so I was willing to make the personal sacrifice despite, at the time, loving eating meat. I don't expect other people to stop eating meat, or for meat farming to die.</p>
<p>If you're against animal testing, you have to refuse the vaccine from a moral perspective, otherwise your position is ludicrous and redundant. Now I expect this sort of fallacious reasoning from the general public, but it comes to something when a supposed expert on this subject, who must have invested a vast amount of time in thinking about it, can make such a self-defeating argument that doesn't even qualify to be described as sophistry. Not even in a spoken discussion, but having sat down to write and thought about what she was going to put into the article.</p>
<p>The fact that she can't even see that her argument torpedoes her entire position of veganism, and renders it completely fatuous and pointless, beggars belief. </p>
<p>But it seems that no-one can see anything nowadays, other than poorly-founded reasons to obey the completely ludicrous and illogical requirements of the authorities. People have lost the fucking plot. Completely lost the plot.</p></p>

        <p>It’s quite startling to me the cognitive dissonance from vegans on this issue.  I’m vegan and this is one of many reasons I’m not getting the shot.  Her reasoning can be used against makeup tested on animals, anything.  They are desperate to find a way their vaccine narrative works with vegan beliefs.  It doesn’t.</p>

        <p>Humans are omnivores. We have canine teeth and molar teeth for a reason. We have more molars than canines which also is a indication of how our diets should reflect. Your dog has all incisor teeth cause they are mostly carnivores. Most animals on the planet are what's known as opportunistic eaters. Many if the chance arises will eat it. I've seen horses, cows, and goats eat baby chicks when on a farm. Obviously you're free to eat what you want for whatever reason you want but I just find it weird you say you don't eat meat cause of your dog when your dog would ravish any animal it could kill in the wild.</p>

        <p>Well, I wasn't really inviting a debate on my ethical choices!</p>
<p>My dog isn't intellectually evolved to decide whether or not domesticating animals, rearing them for slaughter, and then slaughtering them is unethical. I am evolved to make that decision.</p>
<p>I'm not asking for you or anyone else to stop eating meat, this is a solely personal decision. And I'm exactly the same person I was when I used to eat meat, which I did for decades. It was just the right choice for me.</p>

        <p>I never said anything about slaughter houses I simply said eating meat. You can choose to get meat from a humane source such as hunters or small local farms. Every city I have ever lived in has had some sort of locally sourced meat.</p>

        <p>Most ethical decisions about vegetarianism are related to animal cruelty. People that make those decisions do not expect dogs to become vegetarians!</p>
<p>I believe that it's biologically natural for people to eat meat, but I'm opposed to the mistreatment and abuse of animals. It would be hypocritical, in my eyes, to continue to eat animals when I would be distraught if my dog were treated the way that those animals were treated.</p>
<p>So I decided to make a personal sacrifice. I'm not sure why it concerns you.</p>

        <p>It seems to me that Barnes, like many heads of ngos are absolutely controlled. They get told what to say and then they have to go away and work out a way in which to say it. Unfortunately, as with a great number of the covid contradictions, it is often virtually impossible to reconcile obvious cognitive dissonance which leads to this kind of insufferable nonsense. If I were a vegan or vegetarian, I would be just as incensed. Since I have not yet made the sacrifice you have selflessly made I can only concur and add that Barnes has demonstrated her allegiance to authority over her moral principles. This will hopefully lead to her going the same way as Hancock, although I still believe that, including the recent photos of him leaving the family home to be complete theatre.</p>

        <p>That quote is quite literally the argument most people make against veganism. Oh well, the animal is already dead, might as well eat it.</p>
<p>The whole idea is moral grounds, and making change if enough people commit. I think vegans know that they aren't going to single handedly bring down the industry.</p>
