    <strong>Does everyone else remember when every human in the world wasn't political? Or is it just me?</strong>
    <p><p>I remember a time when most people I knew didn't care or know about politics. Now it seems EVERYONE is an expert. üòí Am I alone in this? I also remember a time when people didn't fight so much. I can't talk to anyone, aside from my family, who doesn't try to bicker and discount EVERY WORD that comes out of my mouth. </p>
<p>Either I went into another dimension or there has to be some people out there who think this is as crazy as I do.</p></p>

        <p>Its been happening since the 911 campaign to convince the world it had nothing to do with religion. Censorship began. Calling everyone who disagrees with you a racist transphope. antifa blm showed up. Left agenda lying became acceptable against the nazi white supremists... the 50 percent with a different view. Hate speech became anything someone with right wing or even neutral views reporting both side was accused of. Banning speakers at universities, lying about statistics, and media pushing this disengenious agenda...and tech. I have been following this for a long long time. The population had been groomed for this. Non of this was unintentional.</p>

        <p>‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üôèüíØ Oh wow!!!! This makes so much sense! I couldn't put my finger on when it first started to change, but yes! You are so correct. I wonder why some of us are more aware..maybe because we are not easily persuaded? I know I have never been a leader or follower. I have MS, so my mind is not quite there and hasn't been since I turned 20 (I'm 41 now). It all just feels like a haze. But I started ketamine infusion therapy for my mental health and pain and it's like I'm waking up. But now..im so confused because everything is so different!</p>

        <p>Ugh. ketamine... Try to get off pharma if you can. Have you tried THC/CBD oils? About 2:1. Start with microdoses... build until needed. Good luck</p>

        <p>Oh yes, tried all of that for years. Ketamine infusion therapy literally saved my life. I was in so much pain that I planned to kill myself. If the Ketamine didn't work, I was going to go through with it. After my 4hr infusion, I was out of pain for the first time in over 10 years. I have what called CRPS. It's called the "suicide syndrome" because a huge percentage take their own lives. It got rid of that, my Fibromyalgia, my arthritis and I was able to get off of all 12 of my antidepressants, anti anxiety meds and mood stabilizers. My mentality and health is better today, at 41, than it has been my entire life. It cost about $5 per vial but the hefty charge I pay out of pocket is for the infusion itself and staff time (5 hours total). It has absolutely been life changing and I've been able to get a much better quality of life. Btw, I'm allergic to THC (can't breathe) and kratom (gives me lock jaw) and all the CBD in the world have done nothing for me. No tinctures, gummies, gels, ect. Sometimes, you have to bite the bullet and take big pharma meds. If I had cancer, would you tell me the same? I also take life saving thyroid medication for a autoimmune disorder called Hashimoto's. I was in ICU with a tear in my heart before they realized I had Hashimoto's and Atrial Fibrillation which I also take life saving meds for. Sometimes, they are needed. You should look into ketamine infusion therapy. It is life changing. You may think differently about it if you see how many people are finally living normal lives now because of it. Btw, I was awake until I started ketamine infusion therapy. It wakes your brain up so you can use about 80% instead of standard 40 to 60%. ;)</p>

        <p>Lol chem trails... lady...the hyperpartisan atmosphere is due to the material conditions in the US. You have infighting among liberals in the US as no opposition really exists to them. Dems and Republicans are both liberals economically. The conditions in this country are more and more in decline, folks earning less real wages, housing prices skyrocketing, increasing wealth inequality. Folks want answers so they look to politicians. They want those in power to "fix" it, not realizing that liberalism is the reason and capitalism won't be able to solve these problems, its the catalyst.</p>
<p>There is no left in the United States. You have answered proposed from both ends that completely dodge the question being asked. You have bandaid capitalism from one side, the dems, and proto-fascism(?) From the other. No one is looking more in depth in America at the actual cause for their problems because they are told it is one or the other groups fault. Whether the enemy group is the Ds or Rs or the Chinese or Communists whatever it may be a lot boils down to partisan US politics and blaming the other major party. </p>
<p>To understand why folks were able to ignore you have to understand the global conditions and conditions in the US. Americans were privileged and many other countries that are much more important players were playing "catch up" from the period before pax Americana where after the destruction US capital interests were able to capitalize and establish a global hegemony with this capital and "peacekeeping" military operations. During that period America was in a great spot domestically, that really cannot be matched unless we destroy much of the planet as we did before in the pre pax Americana world. This I'd say is the turning g point for the US truly achieving its imperial aspirations and becoming the most dominant empire. Folks in the US didn't have to care about whether this politician or that one was elected as their material conditions were fairly secure either way in their eyes. Sure they may disagree with this or that, but they could count on much of that profit extracted from the global south, and even Europe would go them, not those who created it. They could as residents in the global empire who had an enormous share of global wealth expect life to be relatively easy. </p>
<p>Now we see changes in geopolitics and economic policy especially from the end of the red scare era into the fall of the Soviet Union. Monetary policy has changed, movement of goods has changed, capitalists no longer have interest in domestic production as profit will be higher elsewhere, many countries have vastly expanded their economies, we have countries more capable fighting against our imperialism though not much, we see information travel much more quickly, mainly though we see extreme disparities in wealth between the lowest and highest on this ladder. Not only do we see this, we see as time has moved forward so quickly things have become so much different for Americans as a whole. Especially more difficult. What used to be expected and easily attainable has become a challenge. We still preach about individualism, yet don't take into account the inability for every individual to meet even low standards in such a disparate and stratified society. We have seen things similar in terms of inequality and it led to some of the most difficult times modern Americans have faced, we will likely see that again. </p>
<p>Essentially, Americans can feel the web of lies they have been told about their reality unwinding, not only that but see the material changes happening and seek refuge from it. Because of that they seek out politicians who they believe can answer these problems society has. Everyone is political now, because everyone can see these things and these contradictions our society is built upon.</p>

<p>Long, but the answer.  </p>
<p>Otherwise I suggest simply understanding the trump derangement syndrome as being something deeper (and prior to the man himself) than merely an estrangement from the capacity of an individual suffering from it to hear a single word about this man without becoming nearly psychotic, in a 2-minutes-hate, Orwellian sort of way. The syndrome has essentially morphed into a form of soft, if not pre- or actual form of totalitarianism. Or as Hobbes put it 'a war of all against all' - Bellum omnium contra omnes. The hatred with which people were apoplectic against him has been subtly and overtly turned against anything that does not resemble themselves and their own particular form of mental illness that developed while he as in office. And I don't mean 'clinical mental illness' - just an apparently overwhelming feeling of displeasure, to the point of uncontrollable fits of curses and rages, when hearing or seeing his face. This is where I see the tribalism penetrating almost every institutional interaction.  </p>
<p>"Nursing is inherently political", "science is inherently political", "policing is inherently political" - all of these have a similar origin from the late 40s and early 50s on into today. The politicization of the world is no accident and you are not imagining it, it is just complex and the process itself seems to have its own immune system for criticism against it.  </p>
<p>But because they still feel unsafe now, even without their perceived yet innocuous imaginary dictatorial threat they created in their mind with the image and instantiation of DJT, they are willing to change the entirety of society to make them safe, at the expense of everyone not in their mental state of fear-based decision making. All to the cheers of authoritarian governments and profit-motivated corporations alike.  </p>
<p>Once you see it, you cannot unsee it.</p>

        <p>Regardless of who is president the US is in for a tough ride, you all are still playing partisan politics. Look at the systemic issues, the contradictions of individualism, how can every individual rise to such a high level when society requires individuals to be below? Why is it that Americans look at every answer except the one in front of their faces? Is it because we still have a significant amount of global wealth and see ourselves above everyone else? Is it because we are selfish with decades of being the global empire, maybe because we are too comfortable and won't want to see our way of life change to our detriment at all? Who knows, but.i vote Americans are shitty as a collective.</p>

        <p>I think about why i see things differently every single day. I just see it. The lies, omg the lies. I see the use of name-calling and slander to shut down conversation. I see the liars lying under the guise of compassion and inclusion. I see the refusal to comromise, to converse, to debate without hate. I see hypocrysiy. I see the evil self serving greedy people in power and I constantly wonder if money and power makes everyone that way. And I see the world trying to gaslight me and the tiny minority like me. I do believe denial is a very powerful coping mechanism, and pressure to conform can be insidious</p>

        <p>Because people didn‚Äôt pay attention to politics all this corruption has been going on unnoticed and now we have a big mess. You can be political and not start fights at the dinner table. Sticking your head in the sand doesn‚Äôt make problems go away and neither does being uneducated around politics. Because we have so many people uneducated in politics they pick a party watch the news and treat it like a sports team instead of researching, debating and thinking for themselves.</p>

        <p>I didn't pay much attention to politics, prior to 9-11.
Then after the PATRIOT act was passed I started paying more attention, because I was concerned about Civil Rights  issues. Also, after that, I got my first computer (2003).</p>

        <p>Not necessarily. Some days are better than others.</p>
<p>My mother was determined that I was going to graduate from high school. I just wanted out.</p>
<p>I hated English. </p>
<p>Senior year, looks like my mother is going to win. I have enough credits to graduate. 
January of my senior year I enlist in the Army on a delayed entry program, contingent on me having a diploma or a G.E.D.</p>
<p>Six weeks prior to graduation I am informed that I'm not going to graduate. Turns out in order to graduate from high school in '79 one was required to have a certain number of English credits (I think it was 4). I didn't have any English credits.
So, I scheduled my G.E.D. test, passed, and had my G.E.D. before my classmates had their diplomas.</p>

        <p>Maybe lol. But I believe it's been a gradual change. We've also gotten older, and politics became interesting to most of us. It was different when we were kids.</p>

        <p>Good point! I do know some of my elders (like my mother who is 64) use to never care about politics. Now she feels like she is a pro. She didn't get into it until last year. </p>
<p>I feel like it's like the drama we watch on TV. The government has conned us into "getting interested" by promising us much drama and great intrigue. ü§£ü§£</p>

<p>Speaking of social media, I did have a facebook page a while ago. My sister said that I had to have one, so I got one, then didn't have any idea what to do with it. </p>
<p>My coworkers told me that you talk to people on it, I thought that was what the phone was for. Anyway, I wound up with 7( or 8) people in my little Facebook thingy. All but one, knew me in the real world, one day I got a hasty email from that one person. She told me that she thought it was very rude of me to ask strangers to send me money, because I had gone to the Olympics in London, gotten mugged, and needed people to send me money get home.
I replied that if she actually knew me, she would have known that was BS, because: 
One, don't care about sports.
Two, because of my EDC, they won't let me within 500 yards of an airport.
Three, don't have a passport.
And I thanked her for letting my know that I had been hacked.</p>

        <p>Yeah everyone has to have a position on everything.</p>
<p>I realised when I used to run a fairly popular activist facebook group, that I couldn't just say "overpopulation is a problem". I had to take a position on the solution otherwise I was automatically a racist ecofascist. lol</p>
<p>I just want to acknowledge a real issue, I don't know the solution and therefore am not proposing one, as all the solutions I've come across or thought of are less than ideal to say the least. But nup, that's not acceptable.</p>
<p>This is 10000% worse on the internet though. People in real life aren't that bad because they are less brae off the keyboard so they have more empathy, ability to listen etc.</p>

        <p>Oh yes..the keyboard warriors. Yikes. I literally invited a woman over to my house today because she was talking very harshly to me for defending a neighbor who rang her doorbell. "How DARE she come to MY house. If I don't know you, I will only greet you with a gun in your face." So gross. There was some racists remarks too, but I overlook those because I feel that this whole BLM thing created two very different monsters and us few who remain unphased by it all; most are either more racists now or completely tearing down others because they are not looting and burning down buildings with them. üôÑ But, I tried to just explain that "maybe she lost something in your yard or something." Oh that sent her, and others, to attack my parenting and they "canceled" me! ü§£ So I invited her to come sit on my porch (she lives 3 miles away) and have a face to face conversation. Nope..she said I was crazy and probably wanted to murder her. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I guess I was just brought up differently. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

        <p>You mean pre-2014?</p>
<p>I know a lot of people point to 911 as the real turning point, but I was 8yrs old back then. For me, I started to notice the seeds being planted in 2012. By 2014 everything really took off. Suddenly I was seeing and hearing about transgender people everywhere. Suddenly the word "Twitter" was being used everywhere. Suddenly everyone and everything was racist, especially if you happen to be white. By 2016 it was full swing and as we all know, it hasn't slowed down.</p>

        <p>Do you remember a time when politicians were accountable? Me neither. But childhood was fun, not caring about politics. I do know what you are saying though... Children these days (even pre-teens or younger) believe they understand politics and have often taken a side long before they understand the issues or how they affect the world. So sad.</p>

        <p>Oh and adults too. My 65 year old mother is nowhere near a child's age. She new Nothing of politics until 2020. Now she thinks she is an expert. Trust me, I've seen mainly people in there 40s and up acting this way. People I KNOW use to joke about having no clue what politics meant..but 2020 hit, they are all "experts".</p>

How I managed to make it to college is certainly beyond my comprehension. ü§£ I actually didn't start paying attention to politics until Obama..and I'm 41. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

        <p>Oh definitely no issues with being political at all. But I'm sure most people here will agree with me that there is a problem with people who were not political at all in 2019, start claiming they are experts in 2020 because "they watch the news". üôÑ They fight with everyone and usually have no idea what they are even talking about half the time. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
