    <strong>An Appeal to Common Sense</strong>
    <p><p>Full disclosure: I don’t think that I’d agree with most of you when it comes to politics. Judging by the interactions I’ve seen take place on this subreddit, the majority of you would probably categorize me as a libtard college student. I’ve taken the pandemic very seriously, I wear a mask, and I am vaccinated. Despite these differences, I am a fan of dialogue. I do not think that just because I disagree with y’all that your thoughts and opinions have no merit. I actually think, among the people I know (most of which fall on my side of the political spectrum), you would be hard-pressed to find someone who totally discounts y’all’s skepticism of the way our government (United States) has handled this pandemic. This realization is my impetus for making this post. I am not here to convince you that the vaccine is completely safe, or that the government has handled this pandemic well. I’m not even here to convince you that COVID-19 poses any particular danger to y’all. Instead, what I wish to address is the careless way in which we, as a society, on all sides of the political spectrum, absorb our information and discuss it on platforms like Reddit. </p>
<p>Though I may disagree with y’all, it’s clear that Reddit is not encouraging productive discussion on topics related to COVID-19. Reddit is a haven for left-leaning political thought. I commend each of you for being able to carve out a community here despite that fact. However, I don’t think that this subreddit is a haven of productive discussion either. I could just as easily make this post to /r/politics or /r/CovIdiots with the same critiques. I only choose this subreddit because, as a minority on this website, I would expect that y’all are more inclined to respect someone on the other side of things who wants to talk to you. At least that’s what I’m hoping. In this post I’d like to discuss two main issues: realistic concerns and identity politics. </p>
<p>From what I can tell, realistic concerns seem to be the topic most discussed when it comes to the opinions on COVID-19. I, personally, find that this is one of the best points that this subreddit makes, even though I disagree with the general sentiment here. I do not think that people should have to wear masks outside. I do not think that people should have to wear masks in their car (unless you’re delivering food). I also do not think that masks are pointless. I also do not think that wearing a mask is the type of issue that y’all are genuinely concerned with (I will discuss this more when I talk about identity politics). Based on the subreddit’s title, I think I can reasonably assume that most of you are concerned with maintaining a sense of pre-pandemic normalcy. Of course, “normal” is subjective term for everybody. Some people will never be able to return to normal, as they have lost their loved ones to this disease. Some of us will go relatively unaffected by the pandemic. This is a simple fact of life. The level of concern one has for the pandemic is a direct result of their circumstances, wealth, and morality. I do not think that people who are not concerned with COVID-19 are morally dubious, but I also think that the idea of a “new normal” is not a realistic concern. From my point of view, there isn’t a single person I know who is happy with the changes the pandemic has imposed on our lives. At this point it seems that the primary concern (at least from the posts I’ve seen on this subreddit) is the possibility of the government taking advantage of the discord this pandemic has sewed a la <em>It</em> <em>Can’t</em> <em>Happen Here</em>. Though I think that this is a reasonable concern for every member of a sovereign society, I believe that this fear is not a result of real possibility, but the media whipping up our emotions. Before Biden took office, those on the left side of the political spectrum were completely convinced that Trump was going to attempt to become a dictator. At the end of the day, however, despite the events that took place on January 6th 2021, there was no real threat of this occurring. This was a fear manufactured by sensationalized politics. The same has occurred with those extremely afraid of the COVID-19 and those who outright disregard its dangers. Is it a potentially dangerous disease? Yes. Should you take all precautions against catching it? Well, depending on who you ask, yes or no. The true answer is that it depends on our individual circumstances. If we all used common sense to navigate these problems instead of devoting ourselves to these sensationalized hypotheticals, there would probably be a lot more people left alive today. </p>
<p>Response to the pandemic has been completely absorbed by identity politics. If you’re left-leaning, you’re pro-vaccine, pro-mask, and pro-lockdown. If you’re right-leaning, you’re anti-vaccine, anti-mask, and anti-lockdown. In reality this isn’t true, but our information sources seem to make it out to be this way. Identity politics, I believe, has been the primary resultant of the 500,000+ deaths in the United States. The moment people were forced to pick sides was the moment that we lost control. For what reason? Social media. The news. Political echo chambers. Language. At the end of the day, choosing whether or not to wear a mask is not about a matter of discomfort, necessity, or convenience. It is about identity politics. Wearing a mask has worked for me. It doesn’t bother me, though it may bother some of you. I don’t really care either way. I don’t think that most people are concerned with whether or not someone is wearing a mask. No, masks are not a symbol of the dissolution of free-speech. No, you are not a Nazi if you do not wear one. This rhetoric, this name-calling, however, is a tool to make us angry. We all do what we do and go about our daily lives in the way that makes sense to each of us individually. We are lucky to have that freedom. Never once have I seen someone ridicule me for wearing a mask. Never once have I ridiculed someone else for choosing not to wear a mask. The memes I see on this subreddit and other like /r/CovidIdiots are not a reflection of reality, but a reflection of how others think we should feel. We should not be falling victim to that. I wear a mask to help protect someone very close to me who was recently diagnosed with cancer. I would probably be wearing one pandemic or not. These things being said, I still fall victim to these circumstances myself. I want to be identified as left-leaning, so I wear a mask. This would be the case if I had no legitimate reason to worry about the disease. This is not necessarily a product of my concern for COVID-19. This is a product of the way I have been socialized by the political discourse that has taken place over the past year. I think that more people wear or don’t wear masks for this reason than they would like to admit. In this way, we are all affected by this manufactured discourse. I see the idea of the majority of people being “sheep” thrown around a lot on this subreddit. Is that really applicable if people are choosing or not choosing to wear a mask for the same reasons? No. I agree with being skeptical of information that others expect you to believe, but not to the degree where you have to go to communities like this and actively ask for people to provide you with information that agrees with your initial point of view. The inflammatory language used by the powers that be have taught us to butt heads rather than think critically and work together. When we’re angry, we get stupid. We are not stupid, we can use common sense. </p>
<p>If you genuinely believe that the disease poses absolutely no danger, or if you happen to believe that everybody should be relegated to their own bubble to prevent the spread of the disease, then this post is not for you. I suppose that my main point is that we are all a lot closer on this subject than extreme subreddits like this would lead us to believe. I look through the content on this subreddit and all I can feel is disappointment. Not because I happen to disagree with y’all’s opinions, but because of how far we’ve been driven apart by entities that, at the end of the day, profit from our division. We are all collectively victims of weaponized identity politics and sensationalized information. We need to realize that, on the other side of these screens, we are all ultimately victims of the same problem: controlled anger. I implore you, think about that fact the next time you read a shady article about how COVID-19 is being used to instill fear. If you happen to be reading this and agreeing with me, think about these points next time you read an article about how COVID-19 will spell the end of our lives as we know it. None of us are stupid, use common sense for the common good. </p>
<p>Of course, this is an opinion piece and I openly invite criticism by making this post. I am happy to discuss more in the comments. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Political discourse on COVID-19 is meant to make you angry. Use common sense.</p></p>

        <p>Can't speak for any one else, but I agree with OP that normal is a constantly changing thing, and thus, at the surface level there's nothing wrong with a "new normal" and nothing that can be (or should be) done to stop that.</p>
<p>In short, I'm not opposed to a new normal. I am opposed to The New Normal^TM</p>

        <p>Thats a great comment,</p>
<p>So my question to you would be - </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you thought that wearing a mask was potentially hurting more people than it helped - </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would you take off your mask?</p>

        <p>That simply doesn't make sense. The dangers of the disease strike fear in the hearts of the masses, so we wear masks to combat those dangers and that fear. In that way, masks actually make us less fearful.</p>

        <p>&rt; In that way, masks actually make us less fearful.</p>
<p>Like a religious talisman? A medieval crucifix to ward off vampires? A source of comfort.</p>
<p>In ancient cults or religions, objects would form the basis of rituals.
Rituals keep followers engaged and connected to their faith.</p>
<p>&rt; The dangers of the disease strike fear in the hearts of the masses</p>
<p>A really interesting question for me - that I ask myself - is why are people afraid - my conclusion was - Masks spread fear.</p>
<p>Masks are a form of non-verbal communication.</p>
<p>We know "Herd mentality" is a real phenomenon in humans.</p>
<p>We'd like to forget the great toilet paper rush of 2020 - but it happened.</p>
<p>Would people be be more likely or less likely to wear a mask if the majority of people they interact with were not wearing them?</p>
<p>Masks are our principal physical connection with the events of the last year.</p>
<p>If people stop interacting with this physical object - stop seeing other people interacting with this physical object - they will stop thinking about the virus, and they will stop being afraid.</p>

        <p>&rt; You make sense here</p>
<p>But its the exact opposite of your argument</p>

<p>I'm saying that masks make people <strong>more</strong> fearful.</p>
<p>&rt; In my personal experiences, masks have demonstrably prevented me from catching the disease.</p>
<p>And thats fine - you can believe that - and scientifically speaking - it is a belief because correlation does not imply causation - </p>

<p>Homer: Not a bear in sight. The Bear Patrol must be working like a charm.</p>

<p>This is a true and accurate statement.</p>
<p>Your post was titled "An Appeal To Common Sense" - </p>
<p>Common Sense to me - in the context of public health - is to avoid causing unnecessary harm.</p>
<p>Masks spread fear.</p>
<p>Fear is dangerous because fearful people cannot think rationally. The </p>
<p>biological response to fear is "Fight or Flight"</p>
<p>One fearful person is not a problem.</p>
<p>A herd of fearful people is the most dangerous force on the planet.</p>

        <p>&rt; Are you saying that people being afraid of the virus is worse than those people dying of the virus?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>In nature we see this in herd dynamics. </p>
<p>If a Wilderbeast steps on a deadly snake, its bad for the Wilderbeast -  it gets bitten and dies.</p>
<p>Its worse for everyone if the panicked Wilderbeast starts a stampede and the herd runs over a cliff edge.</p>
<p>&rt; Lockdowns, Vaccine Passports, Suspension of democratic process, censorship of debate, media manipulation, erosion of civil liberties, undermining of judiciary, co-ordinated campaign of government terrorism against the populace.</p>
<p>Thats only the social issues, from a position of comfort we could term that "Quality of Life". From a less stable position we should recognise that as "Social Unrest" </p>
<p>&rt; Can you provide any examples of fear caused by mask wearing resulting in death? More deaths than the virus has caused?</p>
<p>Yes, that is the second branch of the anti-facemask argument - a comparision of physical / health issues - raw "numbers of deaths" attributable to intervention policies.</p>

        <p>Woah .. slow down ... before not trying to convince me of all those things, you would have to convince me of the virus existence, and you can`t do that because there is nothing credible out there that states otherwise.So that`s that .. </p>

<p>As for politics, you as everyone else can choose wichever part you want.I don`t support any, and in my opinion, a cabbage would be more capable of leading a country at this moment.</p>

<p>The coincidence is .. once libs came at power, not just in US, but in other countries also, a thing that .. coincidence again .. happened at the same time with the pandemic .. everything went to hell. Like i said, i don`t care because they are all the same more or less, but at this point they are oversteping by playing with my human rights and even my life based on a credible lie.Got nothing with them if they just keep stealing and mind their own business as usual.</p>

        <p>I did not intend to make you angry. It's a long post, so I understand.</p>
<p>So your point is that you don't think that the virus exists is the first place? How do you juxtapose that with what's been going on for the past year?</p>
<p>I am genuinely curious what your theories are regarding this whole pandemic situation.</p>

        <p>More like, the lack of scientific ones to support it`s existence .. as to this point, no researcher out there came to prove it`s not a pseudovirus or a fragment of exosome. Everything up to date is purely theoretical, build on previous viral genomes (wich funny enough) those are incorect also because Sars-Cov1 since 2003 and up to date could not be reproduced and isolated from a living host but just on computer.Could be wrong at some parts, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The RT-PCR alone is enough to prove they don`t have the virus, if you understand how this testing protocol works.If they had the virus they would`ve used the correct number of testing cycles, and not the misused protocol which give 80 % positives, like they are doing for 1 year to claim it`s a pandemic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If im not wrong, they even offered a huge prize money to first to come with the corect viral genome, and no one showed up with it until the expiring date, december 2020. Also, the "virus" never left China .. even the scientists said that they never got it from the chinese.So it`s all a theoretical mess regarding this fragment. As the whole pandemic was created for the vaccines, not the other way around.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Alot of things to talk about regarding this pandemic, and how it`s nothing more  than a human construct. Starting from misused science, medical tyranny, crowds psychology, thirst for control, depopulation and other political thingies.</p>

        <p>Yes.These are the normal diseases that haunt this world since forever. Check coronavirus 229E for eg, it`s here for years, acts identical to Covid19 (lungs damage, loss of smell taste and everything else) and it manifests in population as seasonal flu. The only thing that makes a difference now for peoples that had the disease, are the Covid19 tests and the pandemic protocols (the intubation crimal technique, and beeing treated for Covid19 while neglecting their previous and actual health problems).</p>
<p>And let`s not forget this .. in 2009 W.H.O changed pandemic definition from number of deaths to number of cases. Covid19 pandemic started as a "deadly virus" that had 0 victims, for weeks and even months (check China events timeline), until the pandemic protocols were applied, and the usual deaths way of reporting was changed by the protocols.</p>
<p>The whole pandemic is nothing more than a very well played game of smoke and mirrors. I actually admire whoever came up with this idea, because it`s serious smart, in a diabolical way ofc :)</p>

        <p>Not because I happen to disagree with y’all’s opinions, but because of how far we’ve been driven apart by entities that, at the end of the day, profit from our division. </p>
<p>We’re doing our part to go against that entity while people such as yourself keep falling in line with it. The quicker people on the left and right realize the government doesn’t give a single flying fuck about you, the better. If everybody did their part and chucked a middle finger at this bullshit, they would have no choice but to pull back on their horrible decisions. But they don’t want to give up that power and control, which is why they have the media fuck your brain with fear porn to keep you in line.</p>
<p>This is my opinion though.</p>

        <p>I can understand that hesitancy. There's no question that people are profiting off the pandemic and the government obviously isn't too concerned about who lives and who dies.</p>

        <p>I mean, the common cold will kill people with underlying health problems. My 86 yer old grandfather just got over having COVID. Never went on a ventilator, but he felt like shit. However, he’s active, and takes care of himself. Plays 18 holes of golf a week and never rents a golf cart. Living a healthy lifestyle is the one thing they leave out when speaking about who’s at risk. I mean, they shut down gyms for Christ’s sake. I think most of the deaths speak more about ones lifestyle than the mortality of the virus itself.</p>

        <p>I would avoid them, but never out of fear. It was because I hate being sick, or I didn’t want to miss work and lose hours. Now it’s all driven by fear, and millions of healthy people were basically told to go fuck themselves during the lockdown. Which led to suicides, bankruptcies, and people kicked out of their homes because rent was still due (another thing the government botched). Now the treasury department has turned into a fucking Kinkos when it comes to printing and shipping out money. You and I will be long gone before this debt will be repaid. As tragic as it is, people die....be it from viruses, car accidents, drownings, or you name it....we can’t sustain this “one person shits their pants, now everyone wears diapers” mentality over everything in the world that can kill you. Hell, you could step out of the shower onto a wet floor, slip and crack your melon on the toilet, and die from blunt force trauma (I hope you don’t btw). Point I’m trying to make is, people forget that death lurks around every corner, every day, but that doesn’t mean as a society we have to wrap ourselves in these unsustainable bubbles.</p>

        <p>I agree with most of what you said. I always found it funny that people were so worried about COVID-19 and then turn around and drive like completely assholes doing 110+ on the freeway.</p>
<p>\&rt; “one person shits their pants, now everyone wears diapers” </p>
<p>To a certain degree, I agree with you. The only difference for me is that I believe that I have some degree of control over whether or not I give the people I care about this disease. I wear a mask to protect my loved ones, friends, and neighbors. For me, the miniscule chance that COVID could be worse than a common cold is enough to justify wearing a mask and taking lockdown precautions. I don't expect everyone else to think that way though.</p>
<p>I also say these things from a privileged position. I don't have a family to take care of and provide for. I have a job that can be done remotely. That's why I said that everybody's response to the pandemic is different depending on their circumstances.</p>
<p>In this way, we agree. We're just on two sides of the issue. I personally think you're overestimating the power of our government, while you probably think I'm overly fearful. But we can both agree that fear is the reason that discourse can be so hard regarding this subject. Am I wrong in saying that?</p>

        <p>My true disdain for the mask started when it got to be where by simply seeing somebody alone in their car wearing one, let me know what side of the political spectrum they swing from. And I didn’t get COVID until I had to start wearing the goddamn thing all day at work due to a policy change. Also, I don’t think you’re wrong in feeling how you feel about anything, I just don’t agree with most of it.</p>

        <p>Trying this again. Automod got me even though I wasn't calling anyone a name, just using the word. </p>
<p>This was a lot and I couldn't really get through all of it, but it was extremely well written and didn't get my "hackles" up at all. I'm quite sure I have friends that think like you. I got rid of my "virtue signaling/anti vaxxers are $&amp;@$" friends. I can't stomach it anymore. </p>
<p>I was understanding of people like you for an entire year, because everything was crazy and confusing. But now I just don't have time for it. I feel like anyone still going along with "covid is dangerous, masks work-wear your fucking mask, stay home or socially distant, get the vaccine" is a huge obstacle in the way of getting our freedoms back from the government. Continuing to go along with this is insane at this point. </p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>My argument is that people who try to force other people to get the vaccine and wear a mask are just as mislead as those who get angry when they see other people wearing masks. At the end of the day, I think that both groups have just been riled up to perpetuate all of this.</p>
<p>If you got your vaccine, then you're good. If you don't want it, don't get it. It is what it is. No use in getting angry at each other for it.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of comments on this sub exactly like that. They wanted us divided and it worked brilliantly. Most of us will wear masks in buildings that explicitly require it. I will, but I also avoid doing things that require masks. That's how much I hate them. Most of us have had all the other vaccines. I have, but I didn't vaccinate my kid until kindergarten. </p>
<p>This is a safe space for anyone against the New Normal, so there are a lot of different opinions. I respect them all because I don't know what to believe anymore. And we are so used to trolls attacking us that using a /s is very important and suspected trolls do get downvoted to hell😆</p>

        <p>\&rt;Identity politics, I believe, has been the primary resultant of the 500,000+ deaths in the United States.</p>
<p>I think changing the method of attributing deaths is the cause for 500k+ deaths. </p>
<p><a href="https://notesfromthenewnormal.com/?p=314">https://notesfromthenewnormal.com/?p=314</a><br>
\&rt; The latest is Patrick O’ Connor, coroner for Mayo and public information officer of the Coroners Society of Ireland. O’Connor has <a href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/mayo-coroner-questions-nphets-figures-for-covid-deaths-40326117.html">expressed his discomfort</a> at official reporting of Covid-19 deaths in this country: “I think numbers that are recorded as Covid deaths may be inaccurate and do not have a scientific basis”, he said earlier this month.   </p>
<p>\&rt; The WHO’s guidelines define a Covid-19 death as “a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma).” This is an extremely vague definition and one which allows for a rather broad interpretation of what can be considered a Covid-19 death. </p>
<p>\&rt; As can be seen from <a href="https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/coronavirus/symptoms.html">the HSE’s website</a> or that of <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/main-symptoms/">the UK’s NHS</a>, there is a large overlap between the symptoms of Covid-19 and those of any number of other respiratory conditions or Influenza Like Illnesses (ILIs). Any of these other conditions can be considered a “clinically compatible illness”. You will note that Covid does not have to be confirmed: a “probable” case is sufficient for inclusion as a death. As Dr. No puts it, “If it looks like Covid-19, it is Covid-19.”</p>
<p>This is equivalent to adding the folks who were labelled as Dead on Arrival as road accident victims, instead of whatever they actually died from. </p>
<p>I think there is enough scientific basis to show there are effective treatments for the remaining 5-10% who are actually suffering from covid and not other existing conditions that covid is photobombing.  So, the numbers become more flu-like and you need to wonder why, scientifically, any of this is justified?</p>
<p>I don't think it is about politics, I think you learned Bill Gates' common core curriculum and can't do math.</p>

        <p>I think you make some pretty solid points, but I am not necessarily here to debate the way in which we calculate COVID-19 deaths.</p>
<p>I understand your skepticism, and perhaps the sources from where I draw my understanding of the impact of this pandemic are completely fraudulent.</p>
<p>Even if COVID only caused five deaths worldwide over the course of the past year, my point would still ring true. You exemplify my point through you comment.</p>
<p>\&rt; I don't think it is about politics, I think you learned Bill Gates' common core curriculum and can't do math. </p>
<p>Where does this hostility come from? We may disagree, but I'm not here to attack your point of view. I'm here to try and talk about how angry this topic. Neither of our sources are benevolent, each has an agenda. They want to pit us against each other.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>
<p>If we count only 60k deaths over 2 calendar years from it, why would any of the rest follow?</p>
<p>I never heard an angry political discussion because of the flu. I don't think I have seen a "masker" attacked for wearing a mask...</p>
<p>But a 29 year old guy was stabbed in the heart for not wearing a mask in public a few days ago. Folks talk about barring and disenfranchising folks who don't do exactly as they want, and your advice is that it's due to politics, not due to the fact that the government changed the way of attributing death in order to validate these insane measures and we should just ignore that aspect, and the violence, and the threats and ...chill?</p>
<p>I'm pretty chilled as is, thanks.</p>

<p>That's not necessarily my point here, and I think we can both agree that there are many contrasting sources of information on this topic. We could debate for hours and probably still disagree. I'm not really here to change your mind.</p>
<p>Do you have a link to the article of the guy who was stabbed for wearing a mask? It sounds like fear-mongering to me in the same liberals think they're going to be mugged for wearing a mask.</p>
<p>I'm not saying we should ignore it by any means. I'm saying that pointless discussions like debate over how we tally COVID deaths are distracting us from solving the very problems you bring up like disenfranchisement and government overreach. </p>
<p>I'm just saying that I think there's a happy medium between people like you and me and these sensationalized politics are preventing that discussion from even happening.</p>

<p>Not really and no we can't. Every single source says that anyone with covid is labelled a covid death. This is how it is done in the US, Canada, the UK and many other countries.</p>
<p>There is no contrasting data, you have made that up. That's just a media trick to claim there is something to support whatever you want to dismiss and move on. If there is no there there, then what's there to talk about? You are in a dream world talking about building your castle is the clouds and there's no point talking with you.</p>

<p>No, you are saying you are a liberal college student who won't look at the basic data but wants to act like it's real. It's a non-starter.</p>

<p>\&rt;after customer attacked him when asked to wear a mask, </p>
<p>\&rt;Can you provide me a good, basic source of data for me to look at then?</p>
<p>No, that's the point. When you change the way of collecting data, then you can't get the data. You can go to Canada's official website for covid and they will tell you:</p>
<p><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/45-28-0001/2020001/article/00087-eng.htm">https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/45-28-0001/2020001/article/00087-eng.htm</a></p>
<p>\&rt;Of the over 9,500 COVID-involved deaths between March and July, the majority (90%) had at least one other cause, condition or complication reported on the certificate.</p>
<p>Every country I have checked is the same, but your failure to correctly describe an article though you can see what happened in the title doesn't give me hope.</p>

        <p>&rt;I agree with being skeptical of information that others expect you to believe, but not to the degree where you have to go to communities like this</p>
<p>This community (and similar ones) exist because anything other than absolute, unquestioning obedience will result in a ban from subs that are supposed to be about discussion. I got banned from one for answering someone's question asking why people don't want to take the vaccines. </p>
<p>Anyway, I'm open for discussion, but I don't exactly know what your point is.</p>

        <p>That's why I came here and I commended y'all for being able to create a space that allows for discussions like this. If I made this post criticizing the overly pro-lockdown people, I'd probably be banned instantly.</p>

        <p>Indeed</p>
<p>Fair enough</p>
<p>Banning certain businesses or locations from operating was just outright absurd. The idea that, for example, Walmart is safe while the bank isn't safe is not tenable. </p>
<p>As a knee-jerk reaction by the government, I wasn't super against the masks. I understand that it makes intuitive sense to say that covering one's mouth and nose will probably help reduce the spread of airborne disease, especially in certain settings such as restaurants. But there had already been plenty of research done saying that covering one's mouth and nose doesn't do anything to stop the spread of flu-like viruses. The masks thing is something that should have been done-away with almost immediately.</p>
<p>I'm not anti-vaccine. I think their effectiveness is overstated, but I think they still have their place and are important. The way the vaccine situation was handled was disgusting. I was already distrusting of the government, and this has not only reaffirmed my distrust but also made me distrust even more. They didn't even bother to put in the slightest effort to lie and say they had been testing this kind of vaccine for coronaviruses for several years. They just released a blatantly untested product without any regard to the potential consequences and did nothing to even try to show otherwise.</p>
<p>I will withhold thoughts about potential "vaccine passports" until they become a little more widespread and actually used.</p>

        <p>Where I live, people just don't seem to care enough to worry about who does and does not wear masks in places like Walmart or the bank.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, I was actually against wearing masks. I figured that we were all going to get it anyway, it was just a matter of slowing it down so our medical system could handle it. That's why I started wearing a mask, and then people I know started dying from the disease. That combined with the identity politics I discussed has cemented me as a mask-wearer. I was never really afraid of catching the disease myself.</p>
<p>Can't really argue with your points about the vaccine. I got it because it was a risk I was willing to take.</p>
<p>Interesting to see how these passports turn out if they are actually implemented. It's out of the question where I live.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your ability to reason throughout all of the discussion on your post. There are a couple of things we don’t agree about, but it’s nice you can see both sides. :) I can see both sides, too. Clearly. And that doesn’t change my disappointment in the other side.</p>
<p>Because I don’t trust politicians and saw through the very predictable bs and propaganda (that I’ve studied for 20 years), I don’t wear a mask and am truly freaked out by others wearing masks around me. Life feels very cold, dark, distant, and disturbing when you’re walking around in a sea of masked people without enjoying small talk and facial expressions. Humanity is broken in social situations now. This ain’t normal and it’s absolutely effing sinister. </p>
<p>AND I just can’t communicate with someone who’s wearing a mask.... I’m looking at them thinking how scared/ridiculous they look around ME who is NOT sick. (I barely go anywhere besides inside a gas station like once a week.) I’m annoyed that I have to talk to my fellow humans through a barrier. I’m disgusted that they may think I’m diseased when I’m completely healthy. I am upset they think THEY could be a “carrier” of the not-so-deadly disease so they sacrifice smiles, unfettered communication, and true connection. I’m shocked that ‘the powers that be’ have pulled off the ultimate psyop - destroying human connection by tricking my friends and family members into thinking everyone is potentially deadly. </p>
<p>De-humanization.</p>
<p>I’m also puzzled by how NO mask-wearer can tell me the actual risks of both wearing and not wearing a mask. No one can give me a number or a percentage of risk-reduction as far as spreading sickness while wearing a mask. And I think that’s necessary because you have to weigh those risks against the ones I listed above to get a clear picture of what is happening and what solutions we should implement. </p>
<p>What I’ve realized throughout all of this is that people around me wrongly assume that doctors, scientists, and politicians are the smartest people on the planet and can make decisions for all of us. I disagree with the sentiment that they know what’s best for our society because I (and many people I know) could come up with better/wiser solutions to this problem even with the same crappy data these so-called “experts” have used to mandate their insane policies! </p>
<p>So 14 months in, it would be nice to talk to reasonable people like yourself and have an open discussion - especially in a public forum! Put the mask on trial. Put all of the solutions on the table. Let’s have a debate! Broadcast it. </p>
<p>But the fact that this hasn’t happened illustrates my point and my reason for not listening to “authorities” about our current situation. They are playing a part of an agenda, and many may not even see it. There are some well-meaning people who are wearing masks, getting vaccinated, and trying to “do their part” without realizing that they are walking into the trap of the destruction of humanity. And hell yes, I’m angry about that. But because of my nature, I’d rather not bother arguing with anyone... I just live my values and spread love, peace, freedom, and joy wherever I can.</p>

        <p>Sadly this is not really meant to be an argument. I was debating whether to tag this as an Op-Ed. This is a reflection on my personal experiences with the virus.</p>
<p>I think it's also safe to say that any sources I believe would be credible would not be well received by this sub.</p>
