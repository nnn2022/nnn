    <strong>Anyone else completely lost their fear of death?</strong>
    <p><p>As a kid I've always been terrified of the idea of death, mostly because noone knows what, if anything, happens afterwards, not so much any physical pain associated with it. But thanks to this world we now live in, I can wholeheartedly claim that I have no fear of it, purely because it means I won't have to be witnessing this anymore. So ironic, because the entire mantra of these morons is to AVOID death at any cost, and I'm now fully prepared for it. Lol at the irony</p></p>

        <p>I was like this even before covid; I lost my fear of death around the time #metoo became a thing because I felt like as a straight (mostly) white male with Aspergerâ€™s, I was basically a prime target for an accusation. I fully accepted my death &amp; resolved to go for whatever fuckin goals I want from that point on.</p>

        <p>Agree. I hope I'm not suicidal, I have kids and don't want to leave them or be taken out in a freak accident, but if I was given a terminal illness, I'd like to think I'd be a lot more accepting of it now, thanks to the current state of affairs</p>

        <p>Yeah. IDK.</p>
<p>The older I've gotten and the more family and friends and beloved pets that have passed away... IDK. It's kinda like when each one passes, I lose a little more fear.  Kind of like there's a big group gathering for a huge party in the Hereinafter, and I've not gotten there yet. The idea of passing through that door gets a little less scary with each goodbye.</p>
<p>That said... There's a reaction, fight or flightish, that kicks in from time to time in a real physical crises when death is a possible outcome that tells me I'm not 100% unafraid yet.</p>
<p>I'll make it to the party... it's just not time yet.  Until then, I'm fucking LIVING... so I have some great stories to tell my people at the party when I do get there.</p>

        <p>Facing death is a great way to find the gratitude in life. I got diagnosed with stuff at the start of 2019, was supposed to get treatment this April, but NOPE.</p>
<p>There's some great Buddhist death meditations out there, they are so worth trying. Avoiding thinking about death is our ultimate distraction, the ultimate delusion of our lives. It takes so so so much to lie there for 30 minutes letting go of EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>Like a trip, you come through the fear, find peace, and renewed vigour for life, not out of fear, but out of the sheer beauty and gratitude. It makes dealing with all this a lot easier in my experience, life is as sweet as it ever was, it's just human delusion that gets in the way.</p>

        <p>Probably not the best mindset - but now I feel invincible. After seeing these way the mental cases are behaving - staying inside, not visiting family, double masking WITH faceshields, masks in cars, ect - and I've just lived life normally with zero repercussions. Feeling better than ever</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just an adrenaline junkie? Next think you know I'll be tearing the tags off of mattresses, J-walking, turning right on red, and standing 5 feet away from someone.</p>

        <p>I donâ€™t actively fear dying. I have fear of suffering or being in pain. But certainly not afraid of death itself. Some older people Iâ€™ve talked to are legitimately afraid to die. And thatâ€™s OK. Just donâ€™t ask me to stay away from my friends and family for a year because youâ€™re afraid.</p>

        <p>I think for most people who are scared of death, it's only because it makes them think about how disappointed they are with their life and themselves as a person. They don't want to die because they need the time to better themselves. But do they? Probably not often, unless they face serious illness or a near death experience or something similar to wake them up. 
So I would say having no fear of death is a positive thing, so long as it doesn't cause you to act recklessly.</p>

        <p>I'm not afraid to die yet. Only because I'm 14, if I was older I would be afraid of dying. It feels like this year went by so fast. Can't imagine what it feels like to be 50+ being forced to stay at home.</p>

        <p>This is kinda silly because most moderately healthy people have no reason to fear death. Now If you ever come down with a serious chronic illness your frame of thought will definitely change. Otherwise itâ€™s easy to say youâ€™re not afraid when death isnâ€™t knocking at your door let alone in your city. But get a serious life altering illness, then the reality of death becomes nearer and then youâ€™ll start to fear it.</p>

        <p>One of the most comforting things I've found is the realization that death is inevitable. No matter how bad it gets I'll always have that coming.<br>
That's kept me from any thoughts of suicide among a lot of other things for a long time.</p>

        <p>I'm a Christian, so I have never really feared death. I'm only in my teens, but yeah, this plandemic has definitely changed my views on death. At this point, I would welcome it if I could just make people wake up out of their brainwashed trance. I feel like I would be so willing to go fight (violently if necessary) for my rights, which at this point are pretty much gone. I'm learning about all of our founding fathers in school currently, and they are strongly influencing my opinions as well. I adore "Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death". I just don't see a point in living a life that's not free. (I'm not suicidal or anything, just really fed up with the nonsense)</p>

        <p>There usually isnâ€™t a moment where a person looses their fear of death, there are usually instances in their lives where they do not fear death and later they come to fear it. After each iteration of this cycle, the peaks and valleys become less extreme into what is mainly a healthy appreciation for death and life.</p>
<p>My story is that I grew up in South Africa during the transition from and post-apartheid as a white South African so, as much as I hate to frame it in this way, it felt like we, our friends and community were a pariah minority. My upbringing is that environment desensitized me to a lot of dangerous things that existed in that environment and among its people at the time. We came to Canada when I was a teenager and I became an EMT in my early adulthood. That experience showed me how seemingly mundane things can fuck a person up and that death was a part of life. I got a masters degree in finance and risk management while still working in that position as my undergraduate degree was a double major in health sciences and economics. I was suicidal thereafter for various reasons and I subsequently signed on as a a member of frontline medical teams with a multinational NGO several years ago and had some experience working in conflict zones, which turned all of my prior experiences regarding death up exponentially. I made the transition to the insurance sector thereafter and now work a relatively mundane white collar job whereby I see death, destruction and many terrible parts of life through legalistic terms and spreadsheets of probabilities and currencies. I donâ€™t fear death because itâ€™s just too pervasive to worry about. I see lockdowns, mask mandates and other idiotic government actions through my spreadsheets now and how it just doesnâ€™t make a lot of sense from a broad cost/benefit analysis.</p>
