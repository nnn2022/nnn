    <strong>I am still struggling mentally due to the pandemic</strong>
    <p><p>Before the pandemic I would say I lived a pretty okay life. I was meeting with local folks who loved the same things I did. I was going out to bars, restaurants, a friend's place and was hoping to stay employed at my current job that wasn't the best thing in the world yet I liked being there. I had a co worker who I was great friends with and we would hang out during our lunch breaks all the time. Me and the girlfriend would take drives to the city or to parks to have a good time. I loved exploring the city, exploring restaurants and gathering together with people.</p>
<p>Then as we all know the "pandemic" started. It caused the company to downsize to the point where they got rid of my co worker friend.  I was brainwashed by my household and the news to stay home and wear a mask if I went out. Mask mandates were required everywhere you went. They are still required on public transit which was what I would use to get into the city. Couldn't take the girlfriend out to dinner because that was considered dangerous by Fraudci which my household of course used him to tell everyone what they could and couldn't do. I tried the online stuff to socialize which actually I was able to use video games to distract myself from the pandemic the best I could. Lately though that has become stale and I just have no motivation or desire to really do anything. A lot of careers now feels like a risk to take because they could be lost due to a pandemic or the pandemic has already eliminated a lot of career paths. I wake up everyday wondering if life is even still worth living anymore.</p>
<p>No no I didn't mean in terms of wanting to do anything to myself. Or that I have any plans to. It's Just that everyday I wake up and well..things are just really bland you know? Nothing much has changed except you could "potentially" be able to walk into a store without a mask and not get berated now. Yet that doesn't mean all the sheep are gone. Or that people won't judge you for not wearing a mask. Or you are able to do something fun and exciting because nothing is open yet. Or if something is open you have to follow certain CDC rules in order to just attend. The pandemic still has created an uneasy feeling when it comes to job security. Things will cost more because of this debt of the pandemic and the democrats they have put us through.  People are less social and are even more into this online world now that folks have gotten used to it due to the pandemic. It's just awful it does feel like at least where I live a lot of people here seem to just be disconnected with each other. That the only reason people are going out now is for essentials and that's it. Or they are going out with people in their "circle" and are nervous to branch out because they are too afraid someone isn't vaccinated. Yet people wonder why we are the bad ones for wanting people to come together. For wanting people to go out and have fun with their lives. If you are living your life always in fear of risks how is that living? People really need to sit down and ask themselves if staying at home all the time just to stay healthy or not expanding your "circle" is really the best thing for themselves. Sure you don't catch any viruses by staying home, but is it worth the cost of your sanity when you disconnect yourself from the world that you are living in?</p></p>

        <p>You are not being present. </p>
<p>Worrying about the future does nothing if you dont act on anything today.</p>
<p>Do what YOU want to do. Do not live for other people, or look too much into how they perceive you or expect from you. </p>
<p>We all have limited time on earth, if you were 80 years old, and someone showed you a calender from when you were younger, and it showed " did nothing for over a year because of a 99.99% survivable virus", how would you look back on that time?</p>

        <p>I wish I had a better thing to say, but you're not alone. I've been through the same issues. All I can say is, this will pass. It's already going away. Soon things will be normal again. Yes, there will be people who are still living in this state, but you'll have the opportunity to ignore them. </p>
<p>We're not alone out here.</p>
