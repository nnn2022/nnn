        <p>I'd be curious to know how many people who are into clean eating and eating organic put this poison into their body.</p>
<p>Also, how many vegans got the j&amp;j jab.</p>

        <p>Any one who is against animal exploitation won’t take the vaccine. There are types of vegans who only became so strictly for health and would take the vaccine. And I do agree we are the guinea pigs essentially. The trials on many animals for mRNA vaccines don’t look good.</p>

        <p>There are also people who drink alcohol and eat McDonald's all day that are refusing the vaccine because they 'don't know what's in it and don't want to put it into their body'... but are poisoning themselves every single day otherwise. It goes both ways.</p>

        <p>Me too. I've been into healthy eating, yoga, meditation, etc. for years. I don't take jabs or any pharmaceutical drugs. People might think I'm weird or too extreme or whatever, but I did the whole doctors/meds thing all throughout childhood and was very ill the entire time. Doctors didn't help me. If anything, they made my condition worse. It wasn't until I began getting into natural health in my 20s that things began turning around. </p>
<p>The proof is in the pudding, for me. I watch friends struggle on 5 different pharma meds, dealing with side effects and never getting any better. I don't trust doctors for anything other than acute injuries, maybe tumor removal or things like that. But for general systematic health and immunity, I don't feel most know WTF they are doing at all. </p>
<p>I guess it just amazes me that so many into "natural health" trust doctors so blindly. It shows they haven't gone through real struggles and had to work for their health. They're just doing this stuff to be trendy. Anyone like me who has had to work to stay alive is not going to be so casual about taking an experimental jab.</p>

        <p>I totally get it. </p>
<p>I have thyroid disease an 99% of the doctors out there either misdiagnose people and tell them they are fine, tell them it's all in their heads or undermedicate them. Scientists push a sub par medicine on thyroid patients so they will continue to have symptoms and need more drugs for their symptoms instead of treating them with a medication that's been around for almost 100 years and has been proven to alleviate most if not all thyroid symptoms and give people back their lives.</p>

        <p>I'm 36. Maybe I'm blessed, but I've never been to a doctor. Whenever I felt pain I just endured it until it was gone. Never took pills, never took drugs. It was my conviction to never take meds, because it's not natural. And now I'm supposed to inject my body with some experimental poison? FUCK YOU!!!</p>

        <p>I honestly wish fear was what leads people to getting it. It’s actually much worse than that in a lot of cases. </p>
<p>My girl is not afraid of getting covid. We’ve been traveling and going out to bars unmasked and the whole lot. She got the shot last week and tried to not tell me. She got it because her friends did and she didn’t want to be the unvaccinated one. It’s much worse than just fear driving it at this point.</p>

        <p>Luckily I don’t have the work pressure and I don’t give a flying fuck about the societal pressure. I don’t understand those that do. </p>
<p>There also seems to be something taking place where the ones who get the shot, try and convince others to do it as well. Of course they say it’s all about everyone’s safety but it seems more like, hey I made this leap of faith without thinking, it would make me feel better if you did too.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I have a pretty substantial list of daily vitamins and supplements I take. I take each one due to years of study regarding the benefit they bring to the human body. What I know about the "vaccine" leads me to believe it's better left to it's own devices. And that's a short term study.</p>
<p>I tested positive for covid in February so it's irrelevant as far as I'm concerned.</p>

        <p>Many people have contracted the virus multiple times. Immunity with this virus seems to be a moving target, kind of like a common cold. My hope is that repeated immunization, whether by contraction or inoculation, will result in stronger immunity over time. But we don't have enough data yet to know whether it's going to become another common cold like virus or maybe something more serious, but still manageable, like the flu.</p>
<p>What concerns me is the lasting lung and heart damage as well as the noted cognitive impairments (brain fog) that many people have experienced.</p>

        <p>I don't know why you're putting the word vaccine in quotation marks, but that is what it is. It's not a cure or complete immunization, but vaccines come in all sorts of efficacies.</p>
<p>Also, the vaccines have shown to help with the long-term effects. The damage is, obviously, much more apparent in those that had a very hard time with the virus. There are significantly more asymptomatic carriers among the vaccinated population because the vaccines allows the body to manage the virus more effectively, thereby reducing both the length and impact of the virus. It's actually been a hot topic lately because the vaccines increase asymptomatic carriers by such a large portion and many places are allowing people to not wear a mask if vaccinated. But we have to remember that the masks aren't just for our own protection, they're for the protection of others as well.</p>

<p>Maybe it's a feature and not a bug. This pre pandemic study would suggest they should know better.</p>

        <p>That's an interesting study. Viruses tend to evolve to become less deadly naturally because a carrier that doesn't die tends to spread it more. So, the less deadly mutations spread farther, and over generations they become more inert and prevalent, like the common cold. These leaky vaccines allowing the deadlier strains to continue is definitely concerning. </p>
<p>I think it's important to note that we're looking to achieve herd immunity and still take precautions that aren't afforded to livestock like regular bathing, personal space (they're very cramped in their crates), and we don't live in a single room with thousands of others.</p>
<p>Look at how mask wearing and social distancing has all but eliminated the seasonal flu. That's pretty amazing. Sure, it'll probably come back, but the point is that with everyone vaccinated and taking precautions for a while longer, we might see this become a thing of the past entirely.</p>
