        <p>Yeah, the half a million deaths in the US, the many people in India suffering in hospitals, the entire graveyards and morgues filled with dead corpses, all just a hoax to make you wear a mask and stay indoors!</p>
<p>Fuck off and wear a mask. Even if mainstream media is untrustworthy, the many doctors with much higher qualifications than anyone on this sub are far more trustworthy. The arrogance and pride of anyone who agrees with this shit is ridiculous. People in fucking 1918 wore damn masks for the Spanish flu, it isn't a new thing. You're not a 'free thinker' for not wearing a mask, you're a fucking toddler who think wearing a piece of fabric over your face is 'a violation of rights'. And don't give that 'I can't breathe' bullshit. If you can't breathe with a mask on, you're just weak and far more at risk from COVID than anything else.</p>

        <p>I had an aunt in good health that passed away from COVID, alongside seeing ambulances and hospitalizations from COVID personally. Even without that, can you give evidence that a lot of COVID deaths are not from COVID?</p>
<p>Also, yes 'dead corpses' is a poor choice of words but you using that to counter my argument doesn't really help yours. What is frightening is that what's preventing normal live from returning is smooth-brain, Dunning-Kruger fucks like you that think they're above it all. Here in Hong Kong, we wore masks and stayed home for a few months. Now i can run outside without a mask, and head outside with one to grab lunch with a friend.no problem.</p>

        <p>then your aunt was one of the 6.8 thousand people who died with no preexisting condition (that was around the 350,000 death mark so adjusted to the current death toll it would be something approximating eleven thousand). Was she in her 70s? 70 and up also comprised 80% of all fatalities</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Look, it's not that its fake, its that some of us see the same social class playing on your archetypes emotions is also collecting massive profits both via business and government subsidy (90% of all Covid relief bills went to the .0001%) then turning around and pitching a bitch about patent waivers which will impact their already unprecedented bottom lines.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you didn't check the news today we are also looking down the barrel of economic catastrophe because of the fast and loose fiscal policies enacted by covid which will drop the western world's standard of living probably costing far more lives then covid (we will see on this but if you ever find yourself in a place where you out of necessity have to eat your pet I needn't say I told you so).</p>
<p>And if you ask me, that's what this was about, not the virus, but the handling of it, was to cripple economies to force starving desperate people to comply with a consolidation of power they under normal circumstances would never agree to.</p>
<p>I am truly sorry about your Aunt though, alot of good people didn't make. May she be in a better place (where every that place may be, you know denominationally )</p>

        <p>Thanks for your condolences man, I appreciate it.</p>
<p>I guess I should clarify I'm angry at those that dont do anything about the pandemic. Aside from that, yes I agree that the government in a lotta places are incompentent to say the least. </p>
<p>How the rich get a fuck ton richer yet the working class suffer a lot from bullshit funnelling of government funds. How they claim 'we're all in this together' but party in their giant properties and exploit millions of people just to maintain their precious profit margins. I see it in Hong Kong too, rich expats party and travel all over here and lower class locals suffer when it spreads and cause even more lockdowns.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the recovery isn't aided by people who so openly flaunt rules. It spreads like wildfire and every large encounter is a risk. Some COVID policies and measures are ridiculous but not many people fucken help with that either. I'd argue these measures are forced because of people that keep fucking us over, not because of higher ups trying to see how far they can twist the arms of the needy. Of course I could be wrong, and that could actually be fact. But I don't see it that way.</p>

        <p>I've yet to see or experience any excuse why wearing a mask is bad for you, i mean I function just fine and so do my friends. Well, aside from fragile egos and feeling of superority.

        <p>if you still think this is just about masks, you are an absolute fucking moron. sorry but there's no other way of saying it.
yesterday you said there are cemeteries and morgues full of covid corpses. that's utter bullshit. then you changed the subject and started looking for sympathy because your aunt died. so millions of deaths turned into one and she probably died of something else. </p>
<p>why are you wasting your time here? this is a sub for people who are against the whole thing but you had the genius idea of coming here to argue. how fucking original of you. have a hero biscuit. </p>

        <p>Actually I think that covid is just a natural occurrence like the 1919 flu epidemic (If you do research you'll find out that they had to wear masks for that too) so unless the 1919 flu epidemic was also a test by the superpowers i think we are safe. And once most of the population is vaccinated we could probably live normally like we were before.</p>

        <p>Whatâ€™s funny is that we have data tracking back from the Spanish flu outbreak that shows masks didnâ€™t do anything to stop the spread of that virus either. We have 100 years of scientific research that backs this up and yet somehow, masks started working in June of 2020.</p>

        <p>Well the thing is that data was probably made by some guy in his basement trying to trick people like you into believing it because masks actually help a lot. Although if you truly believe that the next time you get surgery why don't you ask the surgeon to not where a mask since they don't work</p>

        <p>Holy shit. Do you actually know why surgeons wear masks in an OR? Itâ€™s not because of viral illness. Itâ€™s to prevent bacteria from entering an open surgical wound. You have the smoothest brain on the internet.</p>

        <p>No shit but if it can't keep disease from leaving ones mouth it probably doesn't stop bacteria either. I'm sure if you look hard enough on the internet some wahoo probably made up data proving that too</p>
