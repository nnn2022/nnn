        <p>From reading your previous posts, it looks like you already set in your opinions. So why bother coming in here if not to troll?  You believe everyone should be forced to wear a muzzle and get the jab. We on the other hand don't care if you wear a mask or get the "vaccine", we just don't want things forced on us.  That goes for every one of your group that's been coming here and asking the same question.</p>

        <p>I told you straight up in my post my opinion. Again, I came with a genuine question. Isn‚Äôt that your whole thing? Question everything. </p>
<p>I haven‚Äôt replied to a single comment (except this one which was just bc you were coming for me personally and not answering my question) and I‚Äôve read every article people have posted. </p>
<p>Is it going to change my mind? No. But I just wanted to know. Maybe you should do more of listening to the ‚Äúmy group‚Äù too.. lol always a chance to learn more about other‚Äôs opinions! The whole world is full of them</p>

<p>Is that where you're asking someone's opinion? I see you "listen" well.</p>

        <p>Okay, to answer your question: The government has done a lot of questionable things for various reasons, a lot we still don't know. A fine example is the miracle chemical DDT. They sprayed it everywhere.</p>

        <p>I'm not anti mask either but, from all of the anti mask protests...have any been linked as the cause of an increase in cases? </p>
<p>There is no evidence that we would actually be in a worse position if we didn't have mask mandates. I'm pretty sure that case numbers rose dramatically once mandates were put in place as well.</p>

        <p>Not really. Case numbers went up when we were told we had to wear masks. Putting us in a worse position. 
After that, there was no option to not wear a mask and so I dont think they have done studies to see if not wearing masks would put us in a worse position. </p>
<p>But, the fact that case numbers went up after we were told we needed to wear them, and the fact that no spike in cases has been linked to any anti mask protest, it kind of looks like masks could possibly be a wee bit of a problem.</p>

        <p>The term anti mask or anti vax is just straw man tactic. It takes nuance out of the conversation. If I‚Äôm anti anything, it‚Äôs anti government being able to implement fake laws on a whim. 
Now let‚Äôs get into some benefits of lying about it. Money. If you take all the people and put masks on them, it feeds into the narrative that were in the midst of extremely deadly disease. I disagree with that notion, but I suppose it‚Äôs subjective to your perspective, so wear a mask if you feel like you need to. The ‚Äúconvincing‚Äù of everyone that were in a deadly pandemic, made it all too easy to justify the lockdowns, which is where the money comes into play. Huge transfer of wealth from local mom and pop businesses into the pockets of big corporations. And do I believe that these politicians, ‚Äúscientists‚Äù, government agencies are in bed with big corporations? Why yes I do. 
With all of that said, that is just simply my thoughts on the matter, and in no way expect you or anyone else to see things exactly like me. Which is why integrity of freedom is more important than maybe dying. We do not want to be controlled by mob think. Mob think is not nearly as efficient as individual thought. ‚ÄúSo many people agree with me, I must be right‚Äù. Wrong. Maybe you are right, and maybe you and all your brethren are entirely too dependent on the government and would like to get more stim checks. Just my perspective. My only request is that I‚Äôm allowed to have my perspective and not forced or coerced into injecting a vaccine that I feel I don‚Äôt need. Pretty simple</p>

        <p>I think you missed the point, it's not about what they gain, I'm not a conspiracist. I don't want to wear a mask, that's the only thing that matters and as a free person, I should not have to nor should anyone be able to force me to. No means no, i don't need a reason or excuse other than "No." If you want to look ridiculous, thats up to you, but don't force your unwanted fashion statements on us.</p>
