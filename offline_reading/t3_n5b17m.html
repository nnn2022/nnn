    <strong>Warning to Pennsylvania</strong>
    <p><p>So it begins. This is a warning to not only Pennsylvania, but all of the United States. Governor Wolf of PA, is lifting all mandates (except for masks) on May 31st. He claims that he will lift the mask mandate when 70% of the adults in PA are fully vaccinated. </p>
<p>This is my question. Obviously we know the media controls the narrative about everything. The CDC are considered the "End All Be All" when it comes to any virus, to any issues within the public as far as diseases/illnesses are concerned. </p>
<p>So my question is, who the hell is going to keep the CDC in check? When the mask mandate lifts, who says that the new narrative will be to claim that the virus cases are surging? What will then happen, is there will be increased divisions amongst the people of the US/PA. The people will start fighting themselves, saying how "anti-vax" individuals are the reason we're still seeing cases, even though we're really not. The CDC has the power to just make things up, and people will just blindly believe it as factual information. No one is fact checking them, no one is keeping them in check. Watch for the division, watch for the "case surge" 2-4 weeks after the mask mandate lifts. Watch for the media propaganda to get people going again. Watch for the propaganda to pit people against each other. Watch for the "anti vax/anti maskers are causing all of this" bullshit. Stay vigilant ladies and gentlemen.</p>

        <p>I think that everyone is smelling the covid bullshit these days. there are some holding tight to the lie because to examine this one lie would open them up to seeing their entire existence is based upon lies. </p>
<p>I think they are prepping us for climate lockdowns now, as covid has lost its fear factor.</p>

        <p>Once they have injected as many people as possible, they could run the PCR test on fewer cycles when testing injected people and claim that this is proof that the injections work.</p>
<p>This would cause people to believe that the injections work. The mandates can then be removed and this will convince people in countries that are still waiting on the doses to be injected when it's their turn. </p>
<p>If this is simply a pharmaceutical and human experimentation scam, this is a logical way for this to play out.</p>

        <p>I haven’t worn a mask since May of last year, when I figured out that all of it was complete bullshit. I refused it in stores and what not. It took me a couple months, when it first started to get it. But it’s all bullshit.</p>

        <p>I’ve begun to refuse wearing a mask recently, apart from when I’m in a restaurant purely to avoid spit in my food by psychopaths.</p>
<p>I revel in the long stares I get from people that disagree. Though if they were really all that frightened, and if all that stood in the way between them and certain death was some random asshole wearing whatever mask they found lying around, they should’ve stayed home in their sterile bubble</p>

        <p>Try telling that claim to half the states in the country that either had mask mandates that were then lifted, or never had nay in the first place.</p>
<p>Or the people who survived the Spanish flu who wore masks forever after that which was much worse than COVID—oh wait, no they didn't because things went back to normal after 2 years.</p>

        <p>I do, on here, regularly. Invariably, the texan or floridan admits that they have had to wear a mask recently. They can’t go in target or applebees w/o a mask.<br>
Idc about the Spanish flu it was too long ago to matter. So hard pass on that one.</p>
