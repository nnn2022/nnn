        <p>The Imperial College study published this morning claiming that 3.4 million people ( six per cent of the UK population) have antibodies indicating that they have been exposed to Covid-19 provides no great revelation. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) has already published similar figures suggesting that 6.5 per cent of the population has been infected. Nevertheless, it is yet more confirmation of how irrelevant are the official statistics for Covid 19 cases – and what a nonsense it is to rely on them for policymaking.</p>
<p>According to the Government’s Covid "dashboard", updated at 4pm on Wednesday, 313,798 people in Britain have had the disease. This is less than one tenth of the number suggested by the Imperial study. In other words, for all Matt Hancock’s efforts to ramp up testing, the vast majority of cases have not been detected. </p>
<p>This should come as no surprise. Back in March, the Government ordered people with mild symptoms not to bother the NHS; just to stay at home and wait to get better. Moreover, a significant proportion of people infected with Covid-19 show no symptoms whatsoever (the Imperial study claims 30 per cent fall into this category, but evidence from Italy and China suggests it could be as high as 70 to 80 per cent).  This group will have seen no reason to get tested.</p>
<p>The vast disparity between actual and recorded infections matters hugely because the Government keeps acting as if the recorded cases do reflect reality. A small percentage increase in recorded cases in Leicester and in Greater Manchester led quickly to a return to partial lockdown in those areas. Daily, the Foreign Office scans infection rates in other countries to decide whether or not to quarantine people returning from those places. People and businesses are being put to huge inconvenience on the back of a small uptick in a statistic which is pretty well meaningless. </p>
<p>What the official recorded statistics on Covid cases are really measuring is the extent and effectiveness of a country’s testing programme. The more tests you conduct, the more of those silent Covid infections – the 90 per cent which would previously have gone unrecorded – you will pick up.</p>
<p>As Luxembourg protested last week when people travelling from there to Britain were ordered into quarantine, there was a very straightforward reason why the duchy appeared to have suffered an upsurge in recorded cases: the previous week it had tested 10 per cent of the population. It was a Herculean effort, the reward for which was to have a metaphorical yellow cross slapped on its door.</p>
<p>It is a similar story in Britain. Leicester’s "second wave" came after mobile testing vans were sent to the city. When you see graphs of new infections on Britain you need to read them in conjunction with the ever-increasing numbers of tests being conducted – 15,000 a day in mid-April rising to 164,061 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>There is a moral here. If you are a country whose economy relies on UK tourists, don’t test more people than you need to; let those very mild and asymptomatic cases go unrecorded. If you are resident in Britain and value your freedom to meet relatives, go down the pub and so on, think twice about getting yourself tested – your reward may well be to have your whole town locked down.</p>
<p>That shouldn’t be the moral – the Government ought to be encouraging people to get tested as it helps to work out where the disease is and to isolate individual cases. But thanks to an over-reliance on meaningless, raw statistics for recorded infections, it is the moral which people will inevitably pick up.</p>
