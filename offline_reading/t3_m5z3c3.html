    <strong>We need to let businesses know how we feel. For example .......</strong>
    <p><p>gyms here in Southern California are reopening, and they are advertising that with the caveat that you have to wear a mask if you partake. I've been writing to them, and I say "I'd love to join" (which might or might not be true), "but won't if I have to wear a mask". I know they are merely following the mandates imposed on them, but they have more clout and louder voices as businesses than we do as individuals, so they can put more pressure on the powers that be. So it starts from the bottom up. Let our voices be heard!</p>
<p>(oh, the obligatory, anyone who doesn't like the idea of going to the gym where people aren't wearing masks don't have to go).</p></p>

        <p>I saw someone earlier saying we should just go around tearing up masking signs at businesses. I think you’re is a much better approach. Could also give positive Yelp reviews or just patronize &amp; buy gift cards from places that don’t enforce</p>

        <p>Another critical thing is letting freedom-supporting businesses know why we're patronizing them. In WA state for example, I have sworn off going to any restaurants that require muzzles for any length of time, but in the rare cases I find one that doesn't, I always leave a big tip and a note thanking them for being pro-face. At the same time, be careful you do this privately, because doing it publicly could draw heat onto them and you don't want that.</p>

        <p>I think it'd be cool if we had private state or local groups that could recommend businesses like this, because I also want to patronize businesses that don't enforce mask rules and restrictions. It's not enjoyable to go out anymore and I'm not going to spend money to wear a muzzle, not socialize with others, and have a curfew.</p>

        <p>They just want to make money.  Most that I have encountered don't care. I never wear a mask until I am asked.</p>
