    <strong>ASTRA IN SANSKRIT 'EXTRAORDINARY WEAPON', THEY 'KILL BOTH GENDERS' NECA</strong>
    <p><p>The meaning of the major vaccine manufacturer brand Astrazeneca is quite clear when you break down the words. <br>
'Astra' is Sanskrit (an ancient Indo-Aryan language, the sacred language of Hinduism) for 'extraordinary weapon'. The term 'She', according to the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/ze">Cambridge Dictionary</a> for the gender neutral word to replace 'he' or 'she' in English and thus refers to the end of the two genders. 'Neca' comes from the Latin “neca ne neceris” (“to kill so as not to be killed”) and thus stands for murder.</p>
<p>That makes the meaning of the word Astrazeneca loosely translated: <em>extraordinary weapon to kill the two genders.</em></p>
<p>I've been writing about vaccines for a while now. I did that before the coronavirus pandemic hit. I already predicted in 2014 that another pandemic would be staged, with the reason that vaccinations would be forced on the masses. I was able to predict this, because vaccinations are the ultimate way to change humanity towards the androgynous (read: 'genderless' or 'gender neutral' or 'hermaphrodite') android (read: 'cyborg' or 'half human half computer') human beings to realize.</p>
<p>Former minister Dutch Ronald Plasterk (and of course the entire government) seems to have a big slab of butter on his head in the transgenderization of the millennium generations that has been going on for generations.</p>
<p>In many articles I have explained why the Nazis, under Josef Mengele, were already looking for the twin effect, which later turned out to occur in 1 in 3 IVF fertilizations. Presumably, our former minister and professor of molecular genetics (Ronald Plasterk) continued this work and was allowed to implement the results by first advising the Dutch government from the Health Council and then socially managing the results at various ministerial posts.</p>
<p>This twin effect is also called the chimera or chimeric effect. If you perform IVF fertilization, it appears from <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199801153380305">this research report</a> that in 1 in 3 cases the fertilized egg has the chimeric effect to occur. This twin effect (which Mengele was probably so eagerly looking for) is caused by the fact that the fertilized egg has both the XX and the XY chromosome. If you put this egg back into the uterus of the mother undergoing IVF, a fetus that is XX/XY develops. In other words: the fetus develops androgynous (also called hermaphrodite).</p>
<p>An androgynous child is biologically (genetically) hermaphroditic, but this can manifest itself in various forms. Sometimes two genitals actually develop and sometimes the male or sometimes the female physical side predominates. However, the brain or the emotion (the emotional world) can also fluctuate. That is, a chimeric androgyne can feel male in a female body or vice versa. There are, as it were, several variants and that is now mainly expressed in the LGBTI expression (see <a href="https://www.martinvrijland.nl/en/news-analysis/IVF-and-vaccines-have-led-to-whole-generations-of-hermaphroditic-children/">this detailed explanation</a>).</p>
<p>Another way to achieve this chimeric effect is through vaccination of very younger children or babies in the womb. The ideal time for this is <a href="https://www.martinvrijland.nl/en/news-analysis/what-is-in-the-22-week-jab-and-is-it-really-possible-to-change-the-sex-of-a-baby/">the 22 week shot</a>.</p>
<p>In that context, it is important that you know that vaccines are built on fetal tissue. You need a living host cell to realize cell division. The "virus" that a vaccine is, in fact, is just a lab-designed patented protein with certain strands of RNA and just the alibi to inject the baby with the opposite chromosome. This means that when there is a boy in the womb (XY chromosome) you inject a vaccine grown on a female fetus (XX) (and vice versa). When injected, the baby suddenly has both XX and XY and so it develops andorgyne (hermaphrodite).</p>
<p>&rt;It is interesting to ask yourself how Ronald Plasterk was (presumably) allowed to first help build the XX/XY generation and then, as a minister in various positions, pave the way for acceptance of that young generation that would soon emerge as the rainbow generation: the LGBTI people.</p>
<p>For years I have predicted that vaccination would be mandatory and that this vaccine will probably offer the possibility to modify human DNA from the cloud. In <a href="https://www.martinvrijland.nl/en/news-analysis/mrna-turns-your-body-into-an-operating-system-similar-to-windows-android-and-ios/">this article</a> I will go into that in more detail (read that).</p>
<p>Both making humanity androgynous and being able to modify DNA online has to do with the master script I wrote in <a href="https://www.boekenbestellen.nl/boek/coronavirus-covid-19/38993">my book</a> describe. It has everything to do with the Jewish teaching of the Kabbalah, in which 'as above so below' applies. In the teachings of the Kaballa, the original God was both male and female and immortal. That is, the God of the Kaballa was androgynous and immortal. That androgynous God has split up and must regain unity.</p>
<p>Because in the Kabbalah the earthly is a reflection of the heavenly (as above so below), humanity can realize the restoration of the divine by becoming androgynous and immortal itself (so is the thought). The Kabbalists use what we know as technology for this and it is not for nothing that companies such as Google invest many tens of billions via people like Ray Kurzweil (transhumanist) in that technology that must realize transhumanism.</p>
<p>Astrazeneca is one of the vaccine producers that can supply the stuff that will contribute to the ending of the human race consisting of two sexes (the construction of the androgynous man) and the construction of the android man. It's all in the name.</p>
<p>In my book I explain that transhumanism has to realize the road to immortality and how this is actually a trap towards the false singularity ('merger with AI').</p>
<p>For the Kabbalists the androgynous transhuman immortal man is therefore the aim, because when they have realized this, their God is restored in unity again. As above so below.</p>
<p>And so the members of this cult (which runs the world behind the scenes, from their royal houses, priesthoods and secret societies) were eagerly looking for the androgynous man. This has been achieved through the twin effect (the chimeric effect, the XX/XY generation) via IVF and vaccines at a young age (or in the womb, as with the 22-week injection). The next goal, immortality, must now be achieved via the CRISPR online modifiable mRNA vaccine (see also <a href="https://www.martinvrijland.nl/en/news-analysis/biontech-is-going-to-deliver-predicted-CRISPR-online-read-and-write-vaccine-that-can-program-your-DNA/">here the link with Ronald Plasterk</a>).</p></p>

        <p>That's where it got all mixed up. What was meant to be taken literally is taken metaphorically and vice versa. The text likely meant "original God was both male and female" in spiritual terms, which is entirely different, and not in earthly matrix wannabe terms of a "hermaphrodite". So these wannabes will never attain that oneness because all the oneness their minds can conceive is "rainbow generation". Another postulation is, if you keep the herd thinking oneness in earthly matrix terms, they can never fathom the spiritual oneness.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this. Do you have an English version of your book? I only see the German language version when I click on your link.</p>
<p>Also, I follow the works of independent journalists James Corbett, Ryan Christian, and Whitney Webb, and all of them mentioned that there is some sort of insidious transhumanist agenda at work here. Thank you for helping explain about the Kabbalah. Someone very close to me has told me many years ago that those teachings should have been destroyed millennia ago, but they keep coming back. It is a book of extraordinary secrets (black magic in a way), whose purpose is to transmogrify humanity into something foreign and other-worldly.</p>
