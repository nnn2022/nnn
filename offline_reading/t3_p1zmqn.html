    <strong>Need advice for religious exemption</strong>
    <p><p>A few things to start, I tried searching in the sub already but nothing posted fit what I needed. Also, throwaway account for personal reasons. </p>
<p>I’m attempting to get a religious exemption from the vaccine for my college. I need to fill out a form and I’m having difficulty with these two requirements. I need a religious leader to provide a statement detailing the religious beliefs that prevent me from receiving the required vaccination. I also need to state the religious grounds for vaccination exemption. </p>
<p>Does anyone know where I can go for a religious leader to sign off on this? Like which faiths are the best to approach in regards to this? I’m between churches at the moment. I also have no idea what to write for my religious grounds on declining. </p>
<p>Thanks to all in advance</p></p>

        <p>No you don't.  Look at the Laws in the state, but generally the threshold is "a strongly held belief".  However, they cannot define what a strongly held belief is.  What they are hoping will happen is that people who are not actually religious will not use the form because they need somebody to sign off on it.  But a specific religion is actually not required (probably) on your state.  It is not up to them to determine what your religion is or where your beliefs come from.  Though they will try.  </p>
<p>I would probably just write on the form "I refuse because of my strongly held religious convictions."  And "I do not need to provide you any further information under the civil rights act of 1964" - or just leave it blank.</p>
<p>Obviously check with your lawyer.  </p>
<p>Then, what will likely happen is they will call a meeting with you and pressure you in to telling them what you are so they can hang you with your words.  Give them nothing but the quote I just gave you.</p>

        <p>I support your freedom to decide.</p>
<p>Everyone deserves bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>The concept of religious leadership is flawed.</p>
<p>No one in your church cares more about your relationship to the Creator than you.</p>
<p>I would likely find myself in court over this situation.</p>
<p>Keep track of every individual you interact with and let them know the coercion is being recorded. </p>
<p>Realisticly, instead of burning bridges, it may make more sense to take a year or two off school.  Develop yourself, make plans and let the dust settle.  We see what's already happening in the world - some countries don't recognize certain shots.  What then? gonna get some more?  Boosters are coming - don't let them fool you twice.  </p>
<p>Good luck out there.  We're all in this together. /s</p>
