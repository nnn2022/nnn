        <p>Bc you're literally saying what's important to me (not wearing the mask) is more important than the medically accepted, and super easy to do, action which can significantly reduce the spread of the virus and provides huge value to society as a whole. </p>
<p>If you wouldn't define that as "selfish" what would you?</p>

<p>The irony of the juxtaposition of these two statements is hilarious. </p>
<p>According to Johns Hopkins, a well respected medical organization, <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-face-masks-what-you-need-to-know%3famp=true">masks work and are very effective in reduction.</a> I would consider this a legitimate source of information.</p>

        <p>You just hardcore don’t understand science, do you? </p>
<p>Here’s a hint: </p>
<p>One piece of evidence, even from a reputable source, is not proof of anything. </p>
<p>Science is a PROCESS, and conclusions are made based on <em>all available evidence</em> (and always subject to change in light of new evidence). </p>
<p>Cherry picking a single source either way (and there are many equally reputable sources and studies supporting the opposite conclusion) is the act of someone who simply doesn’t get the scientific process. </p>
<p>Here, the totality of the available evidence does not support a conclusion that masks are effective at preventing transmission when worn by real people in real life - and that remains true even god himself appears to you and says that masks are effective. It remains true even if every scientist on the planet claims otherwise in an article published tomorrow, because you have to follow the actual fucking evidence if you intend to make evidence-based decisions.</p>

<p>This is false. European countries have been wearing masks for months and have you seen their recent case numbers? Not that case numbers matter but it certainly doesn't stop people being infected.</p>

        <p>There is nothing to be gained though. Selfishness is being concerned with oneself for your own advantage, pleasure or welfare. But not wearing a mask is not a selfish act because you stand to gain nothing by not wearing one. There is no advantage to not wearing one.</p>

        <p>My highlights from this short intervention: </p>
<p>&rt;In endorsing or even encouraging the characterization of those who do not or cannot wear face coverings as ‘deviants’, they risk reinforcing a troubling trend towards stigmatization of people with a wide range of disabilities. These include, for example, people who are D/deaf, neurodiverse, or experiencing mental health issues such as anxiety, as well as people who have experienced violence and trauma.</p>
<p>&rt;Early findings from an ongoing study of the experiences of face coverings during the pandemic led by EH indicate that the prospect of abuse or stigma due to not wearing a covering (even with a valid exemption) inhibits some people from leaving their homes to conduct essential routine daily activities. A Disability Rights UK survey has found that nearly 70 per cent of disabled people report fear of judgement for not wearing a masks. Encouraging a view of mask wearers as “altruistic or even as protectors”—and those who do not wear masks, by implication, as selfish or self-centred—fosters a divisive and damaging binary. It risks forcing public declarations on those with health issues or (dis)abilities through the use of badges, lanyards or exemption cards. There are disturbing historical examples of such forced self-identification.</p>
<p>&rt;Public health responses to the Covid-19 pandemic are increasingly commodified in ways that are exclusionary...Examples of designer masks retailing for high prices are abundent yet the study led by EH is discovering the experiences of families struggling to acquire and maintain sufficient coverings to satisfy current requirements for basic social participation.</p>
<p>&rt;There must also be clear plans as to when and how mandated face covering will no longer be required: without clear evidence of benefit to begin with, an end point may be difficult to identify.</p>
<p>&rt;Mass interventions such as mandating face coverings must always be justified as conferring benefits proportionate to the harms they may do elsewhere. Without a full and reasoned assessment of this policy, that justification has yet to be made.</p>
<p>PS: The intervention points to an ongoing study by EH of people's experiences with mask wearing. The poster looking for participants is <a href="https://dmu.figshare.com/articles/poster/Experiences_of_face_masks/12860543">here</a> and the email where to send your experiences is esmee.hanna@dmu.ac.uk (Dr Esmée Hanna, aka EH in the text).</p>
