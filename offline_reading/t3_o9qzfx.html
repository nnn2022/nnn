    <strong>Nuremberg Code for Ethical Treatment</strong>
    <p><p>A few weeks ago I was having beers with some friend and since many were vaccinated, they couldn't stop talking about it and asked if I had gotten my shots. I replied that I have not, since I am low risk and not interested in participating in medical experiments.  At which point they, sarcastically replied that they should hold me down and force the vaccine. </p>
<p>I assumed it was a joke, since they aren't bad guys, but reminds me about the forced vaccinations in India and experiments that were forced on unwilling participants not to long ago. </p>
<p>The Nuremberg Code aimed to protect human subjects from enduring the kind of cruelty and exploitation the prisoners endured at concentration camps. Sad that many of these rules are currently being violated and no one bats an eye.  </p>
<p>The 10 elements of the code are:</p>
<p>Voluntary consent is essential</p>
<p>The results of any experiment must be for the greater good of society</p>
<p>Human experiments should be based on previous animal experimentation</p>
<p>Experiments should be conducted by avoiding physical/mental suffering and injury</p>
<p>No experiments should be conducted if it is believed to cause death/disability</p>
<p>The risks should never exceed the benefits</p>
<p>Adequate facilities should be used to protect subjects</p>
<p>Experiments should be conducted only by qualified scientists</p>
<p>Subjects should be able to end their participation at any time</p>
<p>The scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment when injury, disability, or death is likely to occur</p></p>

        <p>The problem is that majority of the population simply isn't aware that this shit is off. You see, for them it is clear that the vaccine is safe, fully tested, nothing morally dubious about it whatsoever and thus if you don't want to take it, you're just an uneducated moron. Because, sadly, people tend to believe what they were told. Thinking for yourself and questioning stuff is hard...</p>

        <p>I know. Although I don’t understand how they don’t see this though... it’s so painfully obvious to me. It was so easy to see through within 2 days of this all starting last year. I knew they were exaggerating everything right from the beginning. Just by how much they were overstating everything and freaking out.</p>

        <p>I would say that the current administration of these vaccines also violates the ethical principle in medicine refered to as non-maleficence. Above all (first), do no harm. Of course there are things that can make something non-maleficent justifiable, but deciding that line is a tricky one. </p>
<p>We are also boardering on more dangerous territory - respect for autonomy.</p>

        <p>How I think the rulers look at Nuremberg code. They think they will win this. All chips are in. Any place suppressing ivermectin should be HUNG.... that includes MEDIA, SOCIAL MEDIA, ETC. ANYONE PUSHING THE VAX OVER PREVENTATIVE CARE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. EYE FOR AN EYE FOR THE TRUE GREATER GOOD. </p>
<p>The 10 elements of the code are:<br>
1. Voluntary consent is essential (in most places this is still voluntary)<br>
2. The results of any experiment must be for the greater good of society (this is the only rule they care about and it trumps and skews all other rules, the greater good. which to them is reducing the population, they view us as useless eaters/parasites.)<br>
3. Human experiments should be based on previous animal experimentation (They don't care - see #2)<br>
4. Experiments should be conducted by avoiding physical/mental suffering and injury  (They don't care - see #2)<br>
5. No experiments should be conducted if it is believed to cause death/disability (They don't care - see #2)<br>
6. The risks should never exceed the benefits (The risks are the benefits  - see #2)<br>
7. Adequate facilities should be used to protect subjects (They don't care - see #2)<br>
8. Experiments should be conducted only by qualified scientists (a qualified scientist is one that lines up for a paycheck and does not publicly push back against the medical tyranny)<br>
9. Subjects should be able to end their participation at any time (They don't care - see #2)<br>
10. The scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment when injury, disability, or death is likely to occur (death and sterilization is the whole point - it's for the greater good!)</p>

        <p>They had to suppress therapeutic treatment in order to have the FDA approve the EUA.  Invermectin has been around since the 80s, so patent has long since expired and anyone can make it.  There is no money in it, but a novel vaccine is worth millions. </p>
<p>Agree that people who are suppressing information believe that the ends justify the means.  Time will tell who is right, but I don't believe in suppressing opposing views.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying the Nuremberg Cord does not apply here and that it wasn't violated during the development of those vaccines, because it obviously was, but assuming your friends truly believe it is a tested and approved product, bringing up the Nuremberg Code is kinda off in this particular case, as it applies only to medical experimentation, which it probably isn't as far as your so called friends are concerned. Just saying.</p>

        <p>I need to remind them that it is an EUA and not FDA approved.  A guy I work with is seemingly healthy and under 30. Said that he got the vaccine because it was free. Wtf</p>
<p>In the US informed consent has been blocked by "fact checkers", politicians, and media.  If you are over 65 and/or are in poor health, than vaccine makes sense, but for everyone else, I'm not sure.  </p>
<p>I read Ordinary Men a few years ago, and after last year confirmed that regular people can do some pretty bad things.  Maybe a little hyperbolic, but it didn't start with gas chambers.</p>
