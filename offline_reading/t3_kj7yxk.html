    <strong>A link between pro-lockdown and pro life</strong>
    <p><p>Now, I'm prepared to get downvoted to hell for this, but I'm not trying to push my views onto anybody but rather just start a discussion. </p>
<p>I feel like a lot of lockdown and mask supporters believe what they believe for a similar reason that prolifers believer what they do. It's simple: it's all about virtue signaling. They act like they care so much about their specific population but really it's a facade. </p>
<p>"But the elderly and immune compromised are dying! You're a grandma killer!" </p>
<p>"Innocent children are dying! You're a baby killer!" </p>
<p>Do doomers actually care about elderly and immunocompromised people, who were dying of illnesses and diseases long before COVID and no one cared? Do prolifers actually care about the unwanted children that are born into this world because their mother had no choice? Do they care when the foster care system is full and abuse is rampant? </p>
<p>The answer is NO!</p>
<p>Neither of these groups will open up to a thoughtful discussion or listen to logic regarding these topics. They are so blinded by the emotional fear of death and dying that they cannot even see truth anymore. </p>
<p>I don't think either of these issues are political issues. I think when you get down to it, it's about the right and the freedom to make choices for ourselves. I refuse to let someone else control my life and my choices!</p></p>

        <p>Abortion directly and intentionally murders human beings, often for convienece. Unless you know that you're infected and you purposely infect someone who might die of this disease, you're not directly and intentionally killing another human being with COVID. These two issues are not comparable.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing, happy to hear your thoughts although I don't think that's a very strong argument. Abortion is rarely for "convenience", the topic is a lot more complex than that.</p>

        <p>Here are the main reasons women give to justify abortion :</p>
<p>- "Having a baby would dramatically change my life" (job, education, dependants)</p>
<p>- "Can’t afford a baby now" (unmarried, unemployed, student, on welfare, lack of resources)</p>
<p>- "Don’t want to be a single mother or having relationship problems" (not sure about the relationship, unstable relationship, don't want to get married)</p>
<p>- "Have completed my childbearing" </p>
<p>- "Not ready for a(nother) child"</p>
<p>- "Don’t want people to know I had sex or got pregnant"</p>
<p>- "Don’t feel mature enough to raise a(nother) child"</p>
<p>Rape and incest are at the bottom of the list ( around 1 %).</p>

        <p>I am talking about people specifically who will refuse to question their beliefs or accept new information when it challenges their beliefs. For example I am very pro-choice and anti-lockdown, but I would still consider new information coming in without immediately shutting it down. I used to be pro mask and pro lockdown but by thinking critically and learning more, I came to believe what I do now</p>

        <p>I think a lot of people are hypocrites you're right about that. You can make the comparison that pro lockdown are people using old and vulnerable people as an excuse for their own fears and pro life people care about babies for their own moral codes. I'm pro life but think there's way too many people on earth and if 50% evaporated tomorrow I wouldn't care unless I knew them. I'm pro life in the sense that life is precious and if we overpopulate it could wipe us all out entirely. I'm also pro life in the sense that I don't think people should be using abortion as birth control like in 90% of the abortions. Literally millions of babies are aborted because promiscuity is becoming common and people are treating abortion like birth control. With all the birth control already available there shouldn't be so many pregnancies in the first place. This used to not be a thing because people once valued intimacy and children. Now they're both disposable.</p>

        <p>Where is your evidence that many abortions are due to promiscuity? Because the way I see it, many unwanted pregnancies occur even when birth control and condoms are used. Also, my father was a reproductive abuser, meaning that he would impregnate my mother as a form of coercive abuse so she had to rely on him and couldn't leave him. There are many, many situations like this, and I highly doubt women are using abortion as their first choice of birth control. Not only is abortion very expensive, it is emotionally, physically, and hormonally painful and exhausting. Many women who get abortions do it because it's their only choice, not because they were promiscuous. Also, while birth control is available to many women, it is expensive and often people try to defund essential services like planned parenthood that provide free birth control and sexual health items like condoms and plan B to women with no insurance. As a woman without insurance myself, I pay hundred of dollars a year for my birth control, and even that is not 100% effective. Not only that, many women have issues with birth control as it can have many distressing and awful side effects.</p>

        <p>Yes, sadly my mother committed suicide because she felt she had no way out of her life and wanted what was best for her children. Everyday I wish that she would've sought the abortion that would've saved her life. I love her and miss her very much.</p>

        <p>Yes I've heard your tired arguments before. The promiscuity thing is more of an opinion. Factually, people got married before having sex back in the day. Now girls have several partners and have unprotected sex for fun. Abortion rates continue to rise and rape has dropped significantly over the years so it's just girls doing it out of convenience. To me there's something monstrous about that. You're abusing your own ability to create life. I was the product of failed birth control. My parents still took responsibility and decided not to put me in a blender. The planned parenthood thing is absurd. I've been to one. All it is is girls sitting in a room waiting for an abortion. there's no good responsible poor women going in there for free birth control. Planned parenthood makes money from abortions. If it couldn't do abortions it wouldn't exist.</p>

        <p>Neither. Just pointing out that women exist outside your stereotypes. Also I notice you don't seem super bothered about men sleeping around, just women. Seems like a double standard: if a guy is promiscuous, no biggie, if a woman is, and the birth control doesn't work for whatever reason, she should get punished by being forced to have the baby. That's the attitude I'm getting from you. For myself, I'm glad abortion is something I can get as a last resort if it comes to that. If you think that's frivolous, well, too bad, it's not your body.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's healthy for anyone to sleep around. It's bad for your soul if nothing else. So personally I don't hold double standards for that. Obviously there's huge legal and social differences between a man and a woman once the woman becomes pregnant. She holds all of the power and the man holds none. The woman can choose whether to keep it the man is financially obligated if she does. </p>
<p>I also have a philosophical difference in thinking where you say the woman should be "punished" by being pregnant. We choose to have sex, even with birth control we take the risk of creating life. Regardless of whether you think the unborn can or can't feel or doesn't matter it's still an abomination  and desecration of nature to destroy it in the way they do. Also, if the woman decided to keep it and the man didn't is he not "punished" as well? Because again, he holds absolutely no say in the matter. Yes the woman carries it to term for 9 months but he is saddled with the bill for 18 years. Women will also lie about taking birth control to trap men in this way, but that's kind of getting off topic. We are in a covid sub after all but I appreciate your healthy debate</p>

        <p>I haven't heard from any women who deliberate had a kid to trap a man for child support; I feel like it's something guys talk about women doing without direct evidence of someone they know doing it. Then again my social circle doesn't have many parents in it. What I do know is that I don't want kids, am not a good candidate for the surgical option for various reasons, and think it's a bit rich for someone who'll never risk pregnancy themselves to talk about how abortion is a "desecration of nature"; it reminds me of straight preachers railing against the evil of gayness, or rich people talking about the necessity of wars their kids will never fight in. (I'm pro draft for both genders btw, although in the US I think it's unlikely they'll ever use the draft again given how much war they've already fought since 9/11 with a "volunteer" army.)</p>

        <p>I'm certain you've heard of baby trapping. It's probably more common than you realize. Anyway, so I can't get pregnant that means I can't have an opinion on something. It's still my child too at least for 18 years but she has absolute decision on killing it. Regardless if I wanted it or not I still feel an instinct to protect it but I don't have the option. And again, even though I don't risk pregnancy I still risk having a child by having sex. The burden isn't entirely on you but the choice is. I also think meat farms are desecrations of nature even though I don't work in one. Just because I can't experience something doesn't mean I can't see it. </p>
<p>Now were talking about the draft. I'm glad you bring it up though because you said you're pro draft for both genders. I'm anti draft for both genders. The thing is, I'm assuming that it is something you hold in belief only and do not fight for. Women tend to fight for equality in ways they want without fighting for equal responsibility. For instance even though women have gained huge ground in liberties like voting and jobs for the last 100 years they still do not have to sign up for the draft and they consistently choose not to work the dangerous, dirty, and hardest jobs. They <em>protest</em> for more representation as CEOs but not as plumbers, construction and road work. Those jobs are still 99% male dominated. My point is I'm glad you're for equality, but I doubt you practice working toward it for both sexes equally.</p>

        <p>Women are overrepresented as home health aides, that's a harder and dirtier job than all those things and pays less. I don't fight for women to be drafted because I doubt anyone will be drafted in my country again. Read Backlash by Susan Faludi if you want to understand what the fight for women to get blue collar jobs has actually looked like. </p>
<p>The meat plant's a bad analogy because no one is forcing you to work in one against your will. When someone can force you to have a damn fetus grow bigger and bigger inside your body against your will, then you can talk like you understand.</p>

        <p>That is one job and its not objectively harder than roofing nor is it more dangerous than fishing. It's a nursing job and it pays less because it is less valuable, requires low skill and is an easily replaceable job with lots of competition. I have experience in home health care. I'd prefer it over pouring cement or working on cars any day. Again that is only one job compared to the top 50 most dangerous jobs being entirely dominated by men. That book was written 30 years ago and is totally irrelevant. No one is stopping women from taking those jobs. They just don't take them. If anything there are hire quotas in every industry forcing companies to hire women over merited applications. I have first hand experience seeing it in software engineering.</p>
<p>No one is forcing you to get pregnant either besides the case of rape. And in that case I actually am pro choice. Though they are the minority of pregnancy cases and even smaller minority of abortions. That is my argument. People choose to do something for fun and when it turns out in pregnancy they just use abortion as a convenience. Instead of just taking responsibility for something they caused they just kill it so that they don't have to deal with it. I understand that it's your choice but if I was a woman I would do everything I could to avoid it and only as a last resort in the most dire of circumstances. You've never said anything anytime I mention how men have no choice in it and women have all the power. Do you have any concern at all for the father who is <em>forced</em> to watch his unborn child die? Or is <em>forced</em> to be financially tied to the child for 18 years?</p>

        <p>I'd prefer pouring cement or working on cars to being a home health aide but to each their own. As for sex and pregnancy: my experience is that it is not so hard for a man to be a deadbeat dad , and as for abortion, no one is forcing him to watch it. A man's emotions over the genetic material that he doesn't have to have <em>grow inside his body, leading to birth which is frequently painful and dangerous for human females</em>, does not take priority because it his not his body on the line in any real sense...also there is the question of equality. If birth control, including abortion as a last resort, is available for women, then  sex can be equally fun for women and men. If there is always the threat of pregnancy hanging over the woman's head, then sex can never be fun and carefree for a woman like it is for a man, the two genders become at odds because there is so much more risk for the woman. We have the technology for it to not be that way, but there are men who would prefer that women always live under that threat, because they don't want equality between the genders; they would prefer a world where men go out and build things and innovate while women are tied to the role of sex object and mother, without the time/energy/freedom to do much more than reproduce the species.</p>

        <p>I know you've never worked on cement or any hard back breaking labor like it or you wouldn't say that. Having to work long hours outside in the heat, rain or snow on a dangerous highway compared to cooking meals and changing diapers in a climate controlled environment. You still don't have an actual argument as to why only men work those jobs when women are more than encouraged to do so. But as you say, to each their own. </p>
<p>I'm not saying that the man's role takes priority I just wanted to know if you had any concern or empathy for them. It's also funny how you say a man shouldn't have any say over it because he can't experience it when at the same time you support the draft for both sexes admittidely knowing that you will never have to experience it. Well millions of men did experience it and died because of it. </p>
<p>Now I would ask why you think the mother who is having sex for fun as you said should have priority over an unborn life that she created carelessly. I think our duty is to protect the young and when you do things you should be responsible for them. Pregnancy is a natural thing for women and abortion has its own set of risks and dangers. The problem here is you don't actually know what you're talking about. You're just an idealogue who believes men are out to oppress women by not letting them kill their own child. You think they're forcing them into natural roles that our ancestors adhered to as it was how we evolved. The two genders have never been more at odds than they are now and it's because of new age feminist ideologies like you follow. Again, men aren't keeping women from building bridges or skyscrapers or working on infrastructure. They just don't want to.</p>

        <p>I've done smelly factory work (alongside mostly women) and another job (car service) that gave me pretty bad back problems. As for the rest of your argument: well, there you have it. You don't want equality, you want "natural roles" aka a return to historical gender inequality. And if you think the genders are more at odds now than ever before...you think that during the eras where forced marriage, wartime rape, marital rape, and domestic violence were much more common and accepted, that women and girls were happy with it? Shit, you probably do.</p>

        <p>The last 35 years = since 1985. Not exactly the 50s. And a lot of other cultural changes have happened since then to make things shitty for people of both genders, like stagnant wages for most US workers combined with rising prices for housing, and the rise of social media.

You voted in the policies and politicians who ruined it. Congratulations. Speaking to women from the 50s compared to women my own age it's obvious who are/were more fulfilled and satisfied in their 30's and onward. Anti depressants sky rocketing for women.

        <p>So basically women have always been miserable? Giving you the right to vote only made it worse? I don't know if they'd be happier without it but I know they're definitely not happy today. I do believe giving you the right to vote was detrimental to our country. If it wasn't for women there would be no leftist policies whatsoever. No welfare state, no massive refugee immigration. America as a country was a lot more efficient and better for its own citizens in terms of economics, fashion, and social norms. You've done nothing but make single mothers out of yourselves, ruin relationships and abort millions of babies. You've contributed very little to society in terms of science, technology, medicine, labor. You have none of the same responsibilities as men nor the same risk dynamics yet you constantly demand more. Lololol at that sister.</p>

        <p>If you're self-aware enough to know this wouldn't be received well, why aren't you self-aware to know what a shit take this is? Intentionally murdering a human being out of convenience is in no way comparable to breathing near an old person. Killing babies is morally unjustifiable.</p>

        <p>I'm aware that a topic such as this would garner mixed responses, yes. Thank you for telling me what a shit take this is, but maybe get a better argument if you actually wanna convince me. You're exactly the kind of person I'm describing in this post right now, so thank you for proving my point.</p>

        <p>Abortion is tough bc it's so polarizing, even more than lockdown is maybe. It's good that we have people from all political spaces unite for lockdown freedom though. Whether or not you or any of us are pro abortion, it's ironic all the things pro choicers accuse pro lifers of believing, pro lockdowners do. People who accuse pro lifers of caring about an unborn child at the expense of the mother then obsess over old people at the expense of young people and children. Pro choicers say pro lifers only care if you are alive, not about your quality of life, which is exactly what lockdowners do. Obviously there are many pro lifers who care about people, but it is really hypocritical that pro choicers do everything they say they think pro lifers do.</p>

        <p>I'm pro-choice but I don't agree. Pro-lifers definitely aren't virtue signaling, in fact they get a ton of hate, even a lot of church communities are pro-choice nowadays.</p>
