    <strong>Our New World</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/OGGwv3Zjq88">This music video</a> very accurately depicts the coming new world order. The chess match symbolizes the battle between good and evil which seems to be greatly favoring evil. The music video shows cameras everywhere and depicts a dystopian surveillance state. The girl who is outcast from society and is shown begging on the streets depicts all of those who resist the new world order. The plan of the elites is to shut out everyone who does not comply until they finally do in a moment of weakness and desperation. The girl's face is blurred out the moment she accepts the agenda of the new world order and begins to fully comply with it. This symbolizes her human identity and human agency being taken from her. She is no longer a person but rather another cog in the machine like everyone else. The only other faces you see in the music video belong to the band members. They know what they are doing and want to serve Lucifer.</p></p>
