    <strong>What can I do in my country (AUS) and my state (WA) to help protect my family/children/self &amp; to also speak out about this? Where can I find easily understandable legitimate information about AUS &amp; WA and what the govt is planning :(</strong>
    <p><p>I am very lost at the moment. I watched the brilliant symposium by doctors for covid ethics, also watched a video that is somehow still on YT with one of the panel members who spoke in the symposium. 
I have read through a lot of this: 
https://www.informedchoiceaustralia.com/</p>
<p>But I’m very overwhelmed &amp; have two little children and I’m just not sure what to do, how do I protest without being this aggressive crazy looking person? How do I use my wallet, my actions, my whatever to fight especially for the future of my children? </p>
<p>I’m quite scared for our country, I’m in WA, we have not had many lockdowns but the more I look back on the past 18 months the more I am just disturbed that I blindly followed along… my mum thankfully has always been a ‘skeptic’ and well she’s pretty much anti-vax across the board lol except tetanus but even she kind of… went along with it until several weeks ago when her doctor was like lady… here’s some resources, I’m fkn worried, you need to wake up. Mum was booked in for her Pfizer vax - this is a woman who has never chosen to have a vax except tetanus in her life! She cancelled it and immediately started researched thankfully and passed it on to me as well, but she is in a bit of a fragile mind state, she revealed to me that learning all this and realising her bullsh!t detector hadn’t been working (lol) for the last 18 months really left her actually suicidal… I can still discuss this stuff with her but also don’t want to bombard her with questions and discussions etc when I know she is just coming out of a dark place. </p>
<p>What can I do?! Switched to duckduckgo, I deleted the safeWA app that I think I only used once anyway, using signal to talk to others about this stuff, I know I can move my family (2 kids &amp; my partner) to my mums out in the wheatbelt if sh!t hits the fan… I know I can pull my son out of school and homeschool if I even get a whiff of any sort of mandatory vaccine or mask wearing or whatever for school children… what can I do though? As an individual…? As a person who is struggling to just function due to neurodivergent disorders and multiple mental health/physical health issues and two little kids who I need to keep safe and healthy and AROUND for?! I am anxious at the best of times… I’m grateful I have a partner who pretty much will go along with what I say ha. But I still feel like he is looking at me like I’m a nutcase. </p>
<p>What can I do? What do I do? Where do I find more evidence to keep in my back pocket… I’m lost. Overwhelmed. Anxious. I want a safe and free world for my children.</p></p>

        <p>I am sorry you feel this way. We do live in disturbing times. I dont have Australian resources but you can find more general info on the website stopworldcontrol.  com or americanfrontlinedoctors.org 
More and more people are waking up and more doctors and scientists are speaking out. I do think truth will win in the end, but we have to prepare for the storm.  We are many the real evil people are few. Most people just dont question anything but when our group of aware people grows they will be on our side, I hope and believe.</p>

        <p>First, stop worrying about looking like a crazy person. When you look like a crazy person those that are fearful will find you and you will bring each other strength.</p>
<p>Prepare ways to take care of yourself. I won't suggest anything illegal on here but you have to take care of your family.</p>
<p>Stock up on food, start growing your own food, canning your food, learning to process game meat if you don't already hunt.</p>
<p>Save the seeds (and date them) and learn about seed lifespan etc for each plant. They can be dried out, put in a bag (I put mine is a paper envelope, label them, then they all go in a large Ziploc in the freezer).</p>
<p>Mentally prepare for the hard days to come and never stop not complying.</p>

        <p>Thanking god rn my parents can do all this and my dad has firearms (legally!!! But you know!!!) and will be able to help me prepare/take us in if need be. My mum was saying ‘well I know I can grow my own food, I know I can do this that blah blah’ and I was like man I can’t do sh!t. But I can stockpile stuff lol. I used to have a phobia of zombies and apocalypse like it was… a life consuming fear and I had stockpiles of canned food/basic medicine &amp; medical supplies like bandages etc/water/soap etc… then I decided in 2019 (?!?) to finally ‘let it go’ wtf idiotic… thank you. It helps. I am also going to make sure all my important documents etc are together… everything important organised in one spot… god my mind is racing like if we have to completely de-digitalise ourselves idk I better print out all my photos idk man I feel like I’m spinning😓😓😓 thank you, doing practical things will help me feel like I’m at least doing something for my family…</p>

        <p>And you’re right. I can’t be afraid to look crazy. We can’t afford to keep quiet out of fear of looking crazy… its scary tho. I hate this world. I would not have brought my children into this world if I knew this is what our world as we know it would become just several years later… they’re just my biggest concern and priority and I really really hope this all get exposed properly soon and people wake up and we end this sh!t!!!</p>

        <p>Just raise them with open eyes. I also fear for my kids but they're the most necessary part of changing history. It absolutely fucking sucks they're going to be raised in this world, raised as fighters, but they have to be.</p>
