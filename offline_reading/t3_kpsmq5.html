    <strong>The motte-and-bailey fallacy</strong>
    <p><p>From Wikipedia: "The motte-and-bailey fallacy is a form of argument and an informal fallacy where an arguer conflates two positions which share similarities, one modest and easy to defend (the "motte") and one much more controversial (the "bailey").</p>
<p>The arguer advances the controversial position, but when challenged, they insist that they are only advancing the more modest position. Upon retreating to the motte, the arguer can claim that the bailey has not been refuted (because the critic refused to attack the motte) or that the critic is unreasonable (by equating an attack on the bailey with an attack on the motte)."</p>
<p>Now, why am I sharing this with you? Because this is one of the most widely used and abused logical fallacies being used in arguments today. I'm sure everyone here has heard "if you don't want to wear a mask, you want people to die!" about a thousand times in the course of this past year. That falls perfectly under this. The "motte" here is about wanting people to die. Of course no one does. However, it's being conflated with the "bailey", which is that not wearing a mask means you're cruel, uncaring, and even murderous.</p>
<p>Just be aware of this, and remember to look at what someone is <em>really</em> trying to argue or contest. It's easy to let someone overpower you in an argument when you allow them to equate two or more opinions.</p></p>
