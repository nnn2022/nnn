    <strong>Young newcomer to the subreddit (with some semi-good news)</strong>
    <p><p>WARNING: This is EXTREMELY LONG. Don‚Äôt feel obliged to read the whole thing.</p>
<p>Hello people! So, I just wanted to say that I discovered this subreddit just today and I‚Äôm so happy that I did! And I‚Äôm very pleased that there are 7000 people on here! Yes Reddit! üòÜ.
 There are so many more of us and if we keep trying maybe one day the rest of the world will see the lies! </p>
<p>Okay, enough with my pep talk. I just wanted to post this because I‚Äôm a teenager and I thought it would make some people feel better if an awoke non-brainwashed young person was on here. Regarding this, I have some info school (because I still go there). </p>
<p>I think it‚Äôs probably different at other schools in my area, but I wanted to let you all know that my school does not force face masks (I only really have seen 2 people wear them) and we barely do any social distancing. Well, the school makes people think we do...</p>
<p>We have this sign at the front of our school that usually says something like welcome back on a first day back or something like a prom announcement. But since April, it‚Äôs said ‚ÄúOur school practices social distancing‚Äù. And we also have a sign at the school library and the front office to enforce social distancing. But here‚Äôs the thing, we don‚Äôt. No one at school actually social distances and we never even talk about covid. I‚Äôm starting to think one of my friends is questioning this whole thingy like I and my family am.</p>
<p>There is one thing that annoys me though, we have zoom meeting assembly‚Äôs and we HAVE to put on hand sanitizer or wash our hands all the time. But hey let us use natural hand sanitizer for the people who have some. Even for the people who are allergic to it (which is the worst part I think).</p>
<p>So, yeah, I thought that would be some good news. Not all schools are following the unreasonable rules as such. I‚Äôm glad to go to a school who stands up even if it‚Äôs just a little bit.</p>
<p>And that concludes my speech. üòä</p></p>

        <p>It‚Äôs gonna take kids like you to lead the charge to get schools back to normal. Good on you! Convert as many people as you can. And if you wanna make people like us feel better (I‚Äôm 40) absolutely don‚Äôt wear a mask when you‚Äôre not required to. I get so depressed when I see a group of teenagers wearing them and acting like it‚Äôs some new cool fashion statement. Because now I know they were had!</p>

        <p>Thank you so much üòä. I‚Äôve never worn a mask, well, in this situation anyway. I agree with you, it makes me sad to see young people wearing masks. My mum has Facebook and she‚Äôs connecting with a lot of people who know what‚Äôs going on. I think it‚Äôs a bit harder for me with my friends at school, I guess because not many teenagers people are into this and know the truth. But I‚Äôll try my best.</p>

        <p>Honestly I think zoomers have a big advantage when it comes to thinking critically about the constant flow of information that comes with smartphones and constant internet access.</p>
<p>Most people in my age group (late twenties) didn't grow up with the constant barrage of disinformation that exists today and either don't know or don't care how to pull apart fact from fiction. It's much harder, on the other hand, to bullshit someone who has grown up seeing first-hand the sort of one-sides narratives that get crafted in online echo-chambers.</p>

        <p>Real question what‚Äôs with kids trusting politicians all of a sudden? Do you have any insight? They quite literally do not give a shit about you because you cannot vote.</p>

        <p>Hmm, I haven‚Äôt really thought about it before. Well, my friends do have their opinions on politicians but they don‚Äôt usually talk about it. Not where I‚Äôm from anyway. I think their just following what their parents believe in. If they can‚Äôt vote, that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt have an opinion or a trust in these politicians.</p>
