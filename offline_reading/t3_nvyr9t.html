    <strong>Losing my head</strong>
    <p><p>Sick to death of this shit, I’m in the UK and our puppet master Boris set out a roadmap to fully unlock on the 21st June, now there is reports of delays up to a month for more people to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>This is just ridiculous! They promised our freedom back once the vulnerable were vaccinated and we are many months passed that and now they’re talking of vaccinating 12 year olds.</p>
<p>They will inevitably push this ‘just another two weeks’ to Autumn which then comes the flu season so that’ll be another year of restrictions even with a vaccine.</p>
<p>I try and educate people on the sub ‘CoronavirusUK’ but get immediately banned and I’m starting to feel helpless… We are doing a million tests a day with many of them being schoolchildren! Of course we are going to pick up cases as they’re unvaccinated and that’s what a virus does! </p>
<p>We started to ease lockdown and people should expect a rise in cases from a country with nearly 68million in population, we hit 8000 cases after surge testing and testing the kids and people are calling for reversal of restrictions - I can’t believe what I’m actually seeing.</p>
<p>I honestly believe at this point the only people in favour of these restrictions are the work from home and the furlough and they’re just to comfortable to go back to normal.</p>
<p>Fucking sick of this shit - sorry.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with you, Boris is a fucking wanker who needs to STFU. will this ever end? It's time we take our freedoms back. Britain is mean't to be a free democratic country not some hive of tyranny, that's why we defended it in the 1940s.</p>
