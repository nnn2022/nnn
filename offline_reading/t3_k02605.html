    <strong>The pandemic will eventually subside on its own. We should not let ourselves be tricked that anything we did caused that, because then we shall be forced to do it forever.</strong>
    <p><p>It's just a rant about something everyone here knows, but it's just so annoying to think about.</p>
<p>The pandemic second wave peaked in Europe last week, too soon for the measures that several countries took to have had any effect. The second wave was seasonal, and significantly less deadly than the first one despite the "casedemics" making it seem worse.</p>
<p>The reasons for that are multiple, but above all it is the natural immunity that gradually built up in the countries that were hit with the virus. Social distancing, lockdowns, mask and so on have probably decreased the effective R number somewhat, but as we know that only drags things out and isn't a permanent solution.</p>
<p>The problem I am having is that governments will claim that it was their measures that dealt with the problem (instead of the ineffectiveness of their measures, which allowed for immunity to build up). Later, when they start rolling out vaccines, they will claim that the vaccines are stopping the spread (instead of natural immunity through infections).</p>
<p>As a result, millions of people will be duped into accepting the new normal, where useless behavior restrictions and vaccines against mostly harmless viruses will be considered essential to preventing deadly pandemics, when in reality all those measures did was fuck all.</p>
<p>I just hope the pandemic subsides soon enough so that the doomers can't possibly attribute it to their rain dances. Rant over.</p></p>

        <p>I don’t think so. Maybe in some countries, but not not all.</p>
<p>In Ireland where I live, the attitude has changed. The Irish will <em>tell</em> you that we need to be good and follow the government, but in reality that rarely happens these days. It’s MASSIVELY different than than the spring; everyone followed the restrictions to a T. Now many people are ignoring what the government says (even if they pretend they aren’t) and ignoring the restrictions is actually very easy. They keep threatening fines and tougher enforcement (they have for weeks now) but I still haven’t seen it happen.</p>
<p>But even the most pro-lockdown, Holohan-worshipping doormats are sick to DEATH of the restrictions. I can tell you right now, if the government tries to manipulate us into more restrictions once the vaccine is distributed and/or the virus dwindles, NO ONE will take it. The only thing the government has to control us is the “threat” of the pandemic. Once that is gone they won’t have anything left to manipulate and control us with. </p>
<p>But I can’t speak for other countries. I feel very sorry for Australians.</p>

        <p>Yeah this is promising. And i've noticed out in the real world people aren't as anal. On the internet you can rara masks all you want and tell people to die if they don't wear them. But let's see them say it to your face, most wouldn't. </p>
<p>I think we were all worried in the spring. We had no idea what how deadly it was, or anything about the virus really. But more and more people are catching on that something just isn't right. And maybe we shouldn't blindly follow restrictions set out by officials that clearly don't care about our livelihoods.</p>

        <p>The pandemic <em>HAS</em> subsided on its own.</p>
<p>The second wave theory of the Spanish Flu is somewhat debated as I understand.  The "second (third, fourth!) wave theories/doom prophecies of covid are purely alarmist horse shit, designed to wring this crisis for all it's worth, as far as I can tell.
"Cases" (positive PCR test results) =/= pandemic.</p>

        <p>Infections are down for the second week in a row in the whole of Europe. Mortality was much lower than the first time, although not zero. There was a second wave only because the epidemic started in the spring, so it couldn't burn through effectively. There won't be a third wave to speak of.</p>

        <p>I concur.  Lockdowns and seasonality may have broken up a single "wave".  The big splash is over.</p>

        <p>People don’t like feeling helpless. It’s funny to me that no one ever says “maybe there’s nothing we can do but just toughen the fuck up and carry on” in any situation. We always have to enact some ‘plan’. I like to accept the arbitrary randomness of the universe and stop blaming my fellow man for all the suffering.</p>
