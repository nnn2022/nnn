        <p>So I've got several friends that work at the hospital. I literally live one block away from my cities biggest hospital. Most of these friends work in som administrative capacity. A couple are actual front line workers and the both got Covid. </p>
<p>They both refused the vaccine, not because they didn't believe in it, but because supply was low when it came out. They believe that since they hadn't got it a second time that they are immune. They both got removed from the Covid ward (which is very over staffed). They both had to sign papers that said they wouldn't peruse a work injury suit if they got it again. (Which doesn't make sense since "long term effects" can be traced to the first time.) </p>
<p>The administration group think those two are the worst people. "How dare they call themselves nurses." </p>
<p>Yeah, they went to medical school and you went to some kind of clerk school. How dare they let others who want the vaccine get it.</p>

        <p>Someone should tell that to the two medical schools I'm near. They claim to teach all aspects of medicine and quite a few pharmacist graduate from one. They also teach to turn out RN and NPs. I myself have taken classes at one. I didn't drop out of being a doctor.</p>

        <p>Medical school is a specific term though which references MD and DO education. I wouldn't say a i was applying to medical school if I was atfempting to become a pharmacists or a nurse. </p>
<p>Accuracy in language is important so I don't get why I'm getting downvoted for stating terminology. Salty nurses probably.</p>

        <p>Probably because you don't have to become a an MD or DO by going to a medical school. Also that schools that turn our people who want to be MD or DO don't necessarily go to schools with "Medical school" in the title. </p>
<p>Let's take Stanford University of Medicine. As you say people who go there might want to be a MD, but they also have undergraduate and masters degrees available on the same campus for people who want a medicine related education but have no intention of becoming a physician. Is the school both kinds of people attend under the same name not a medical school?</p>

        <p>Nursing and medicine are literally different career fields</p>
<p>Both nursing and medicine are career fields that revolve around providing health care to patients. However, the focus of these disciplines is different. When you study nursing, you’re preparing for a career in caring for patients. While providing that care can take many forms, including administering medication and checking vital signs, everything you will do as a nurse works toward that primary goal of providing patient care. Doctors, on the other hand, focus more on diagnosing and treating medical conditions.</p>

<p>Got it. The very definition of medicine. They go to medical schools and not holistic healing schools. Those are the only two school types that deal in patient care. One uses science, <strong>medical science</strong>, while the other uses tradition based on informal results. </p>
<p>What is wrong with you that you think medical schools themselves are using the term wrong?</p>

        <p>&rt;So you’re saying that doctors and nurses study the same thing? </p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>&rt;What course to doctors do at college? What course to nurses do at college? </p>
<p>I'm sure they are different.</p>
<p>&rt;I literally sent you a link of the separate courses. Are you reading anything I’ve said?</p>
<p>You literally sent me courses that are considered medical. What's your point?</p>
<p>You clearly are jumping to conclusions about the definition of medical and medicine and how broad they are indeed applied and are seeking to gate keep the words. At this point you'll have to show me the letters you've written to all the major dictionaries to get them to drop all the meanings you don't like. I'm sure you have since you've been trying to just convince me that I shouldn't be using the common use of the words that are recorded.</p>

        <p>&rt;To become a doctor, the literal course you study is MEDICINE.</p>
<p>Wrong. There are many medical courses with many titles. There is no course titled "medicine" that is exclusive to doctors. Would you have to take a general course on medicine to be a doctor, sure. </p>
<p>&rt;To become a nurse the course you study is NURSING. </p>
<p>Again wrong. There are many medical courses with many titles. There is no medical course titled "nursing" that is exclusive to nurses. </p>
<p>Since you failed to show me the effort you've made to have the definition changed officially and that your attempt to do so was just literally a lie I'm blocking you as a troll.</p>

        <p>I've done the <a href="https://i.redd.it/ran1gvkh63t61.png">math before</a>, and it doesn't add up. Brazil with 3000+ deaths every day and you can see online that some hospitals are at 60% capacity. Meanwhile, Canada had 50 deaths every day and they were freaking out that it's almost at capacity. Canada got more ICU beds and staff than Brazil, and even if you account for differences in population size, if Brazilian numbers can be trusted, Canada should have been able to handle 600 deaths every day without being full.</p>

        <p>When the mayor of Houston came out last year and said that hospitals were "at max capacity", I did some research online and figured out how they made that claim. Now I only did this for two of the five major hospitals in Houston, but the results for both came out to be very similar so I can extrapolate that it was likely the same for the other three.</p>
<p>The two hospitals I looked at had five sets of beds: Phase 1, Phase 1 Overflow, Phase 2, Phase 2 Overflow, and ICU. Phase 1 was where they were putting COVID patients. Phase 1 was full. Phase 1 Overflow was also full. That made up about 35% of the hospital's total beds, for both hospitals I looked at.</p>
<p>Phase 2 and Phase 2 overflow were completely empty. ICU was at 10% for one of the hospitals, 15% for the other.</p>
<p>Total hospital occupancy was around 40% for both hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>On a normal day pre-COVID, those same hospitals had nearly 70% occupancy.</strong></p>
<p>They were intentionally being misleading about the number of beds in use, saying that the hospital was at full capacity when it was only Phase 1 and Phase 1 Overflow that was full. However, both hospitals I looked at said on their websites "Phase 2 and ICU beds can be converted to Phase 1 at any time as the need arises."</p>
<p>So they could literally keep their Phase 1 occupancy at 100% all the time by just rotating unused beds back to Phase 2 or ICU and no one would know the difference.</p>
<p>This is how politicians were able to make the claim that the hospitals were full.</p>

        <p>Yes I saw the same in San Diego.  They counted only staffed beds as part of current capacity, but they only staff a few extra beds beyond currently used beds so that makes it look like we are always near current capacity.  We had lots of extra beds but they don't call in nurses to staff a bunch of empty beds, that wastes too much money.  If you counted the number of licensed beds available, that would have been more accurate but they didn't do that.  Also our governor was counting covid patients as 1.5 people per person, talk about super fuzzy math!!  In this way, he could say our state's hospitals were over capacity even when they had lotsa empty beds available.  Also all the fear porn of disease made some peeps afraid to go to the hospital that otherwise would have.</p>

        <p>I'm Czech. During the second wave, we were often called the "worst hit" country. Yet no hospital was ever overflowing with patients, only around 20 people were send to hospitals abroad (those living so close to the border that German hospitals were the closest ones) and the emergency military hospital build in Prague was empty, after some time dismantled. There simply wasn't enough patients to fill the normal capacity of hospitals.</p>

        <p>It's total bullshit. I'm in ireland and there is literally nothing happening. Still the daily updates of cases and the handful of deaths spanning the last few months even though there's no flu deaths now. We see headlines that say "54 new covid deaths confirmed", which isn't a lot in a country of 5 million and no flu deaths, but when you read the article it tells you that only 10 have died in April, 14 in March etc. </p>
<p>Still the strict lockdown though. We've only recently been allowed to stray more than 5km from home, but businesses are still closed under the strictest and longest lockdown in Europe.</p>
<p>If there's no crisis they can not distribute the emergency use only experimental vaccines. So the same way as they have created a crisis, they will keep the crisis going. At this point, they know they can convince the masses of whatever. It's actually laughable here in Ireland, the 2018 flu season was worse than this year's and at the moment there is NOTHING that warrants these restrictions but people are still complying. It's sad and scary.</p>

        <p>As an American living in this trash 3rd world country, I can explain this:</p>
<p>Canadians are gigantic pussies. It's part of their national character. They nurture and encourage weakness under the guise of safety. At this point, Canadian hospital admissions for covid are seasonal allergy sufferers who really really want covid. The medical establishment encourages this bc "better to be safe 🥺". I fucking guarantee this.</p>
<p>So yes, it's entirely possible that these hospitals are at capacity. With people who really should be told to stfu, go home and take a benadryl.</p>

        <p>From what I remember, most of that footage of the overwhelmed hospitals in Italy were actually like two hospitals in the hardest hit city. Every other hospital in the country was not overwhelmed. Same thing happened in New York. One or two hospitals got hammered, but lots of other hospitals in the city had room and it was just a matter of getting the patients relocated. That is why the Mercy and the center they set up for overflow were both shutdown without being used.</p>

        <p>probably just two poorly managed hospitals. Like when NYC had Javit Center &amp; Hospital Ship, used neither, and still had to fake covid #’s by adding those that died in Nursing Homes to the Hospital tally to make the hospitals look overwhelmed while brushing Cuomo’s murder victims under the rug.</p>

        <p>The American media used footage from Bergamo in Italy and told people it was from NYC, they were caught red handed and nothing happened.  They called it an 'editing mistake'.  People still believe what they are being told.  I realised in late March / early April last year, nothing is going to change the path we're on, everyone is suffering severe cognitive dissonance and you will never get them to admit they have been hopelessly fooled.</p>

        <p>Now you hear hospitals complaining about being "over capacity". </p>
<p>What the lying legacy media doesn't tell ya is they are NOT talking about beds.  They have plenty of open beds. They are under-staffed is all.</p>
<p>The ridiculous, deadly lockdowns created that problem. Half the doctors and nurses are on furlough because hospitals are not allowed to do normal (even life-saving) procedures. </p>
<p>It's not that there is a huge amount of cases, it's that there is a huge shortage of medical staff, because of anti-science lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Over 12 months to design covid ICU care crash course for existing nurses to cross train on so we wouldn't have this problem. Essentially all governments decided it was better to destroy the lives of their citizens with lockdowns in the hopes that existing staff would cover any surges. If something big happens they have no one to blame but themselves. In that case the doomers would go into overdrive with the "it's selfish people like you" arguments.</p>

        <p>I live in a large city in Ontario Canada. Truly heartbreaking how certain people will just believe outright lies for the sake of this fragile existence to continue.
2 good friends are Doctors at the Hospital. ICU's have the same regular people as they always had in them. No more no less. These Doctors, veteran Docs of 45 years, are physically blocked by people who don't even work at the Hospital from entering the supposed 'Covid Ward' 
Verbally accosted when they sarcastically say "well isn't it a war zone we have lots of free time right now how can we help?"
Finally they will be sternly told, often screamed at to vacate the area by these Covid guards when they inevitably ask "why the heck is this place always empty anyway?.</p>

        <p>I had a conversation with my friend about this and he just kept bringing this up. "OUR HOSPITALS ARE LITERALLY PACKED BRO" like, alright. Tell me why half the world is still ordering pizza and going out of town during a pandemic. Not to mention the fact that pretty much everybody's buying drugs still and handling dirty money. There's a false reality being shoved into people's eyes. Honestly , at this point everything is a false reality yo, check yo self !</p>

        <p>We have a similar problem in the US. Whenever a Democrat is in power, media coverage is overwhelmingly positive. Whenever a Republican is in power, media coverage is overwhelmingly negative. In the US, the media’s goal is to try and associate normalcy, civility, and prosperity with the Democrats. I’d even go so far to say the media is the propaganda wing of the Democratic Party</p>

        <p>The fact that there hasn't been a worldwide call for retired or part time nurses and speed training of med students just shows this is not a pandemic.</p>
<p>We had a family member admitted to ICU in April last year,</p>
<p>Not for Covid but for sepsis, he was crammed into a single ward in the hospital, named the Covid ward. Even after 3 tests a day, they all came back negative.</p>
<p>The rest of the hospital was taped off, this wasn't a government institution but a private one.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure where you are but nurses and doctors most definitely came out of retirement where I am, as did a lot of clinical professors I work with - they went back to ICU/wards. Medical students graduated early and fast tracked, as were nursing students.</p>

        <p>They are still young and want to be back on the Frontline but since last year they have taken massive pay cuts and sometimes had to put in they're own money to take care of some of the elderly, the kids just basically dump them and expect the state to look after them.</p>

        <p>I doubt it, any politician who is openly against the globalists and has some power (like a president) would just get suicided, like the Tanzanian president. There are no outsiders in politics. Globalists bought and can buy anyone, that is why judges are quiet, because the elite are above justice, they are the bosses of everyone important so the only people we can trust is ourselves.</p>

        <p>I have two friends working in hostpitals here in Sweden. One is a nurse at an ICU is Stockholm and the other is an MD at a hospital in a town up north.</p>
<p>In Stockholm, the ICU staff is rather stressed, and they are operating on close to max capacity - but they have been doing that well before the pandemic. Many come in with flu like symtoms and some are transfered to covid wards. My friend there said they have a big problem with people who are very anxious, and visit the hospital because of that. He said he wished media would tone down the scare tactic, and claimed it would help them a lot. </p>
<p>The other one works with elderly, and the first wave of the pandemic didn't hit them particularly hard. This time however, there are lots of elderly (+80) people dying. She has however gone full covidiot and is arguing for mass testing, school closures etc. </p>
<p>Conclusion: It's not all fake, but media and politicians are making it all worse. It's a bad flu, and hits certain populations fairly hard. </p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, if we hadn't cut down our hospitals and care homes in the way it's been done in the past decades, this pandemic would've been easily manageable. Swe has like a third of the ICU beds it had 20 years ago, and a fraciton of ventilators etc. Staff is also a lot more stressed now because of budget cuts and so on. The politicians are to blame for worsening the effects of the pandemic - and now they "solve" it by putting restrictions on the public. They should all resign and apologize.</p>

        <p>I don’t doubt that this video is real but there where similar videos in my country when cases were going down and ICUs started getting cleared out. </p>
<p>That said, it’s a bit weird. Could be resource misallocation, recently emptied beds or a multinational conspiracy to put us all on government sponsored vaccines and UBI. </p>
<p>We’ll see soon.</p>

        <p>I'm from Brazil, and this title is misleading. The nurses are actually happy that there are no more people on the beds, since the situation is starting to get better, since we started the vaccination. They even say so in the video.</p>

        <p>Sure m8. Brazil is the worst country in the pandemic rn, with thousands of dead people reported every day. Why would the media be lying about the pandemic, to support the elites? The government? Those nurses were singing about life and god. Ya know what I’m thinking bud? They are just celebrating their hospital finally being empty. Celebrating their work throughout the pandemic, and now finally having a rest.</p>

<p>The media is lying because the actual president cut the billions they used to receive every year. Because as an underdog he wasn’t supposed to win the election (they wanted the psdb party, ally to the pt party via “foro de são paulo”). </p>
<p>Plus, if those nurses are happy about the hospital finally empty, how is the Brazil the worst country of the world? </p>

        <p>The current president indeed has a anti-media outlook, as you can tell by the many scandals between him, his family, journalists and corruption. But still, how could the president cut funding from a private initiative? and HOW would the media lying afterwards would make any sense? They want "revenge"?????? Why would they want Psdb specifically, and when they didnt win the elections, why would the media lie about covid?? Because undermining the current goverment of Brasil is something that itself does basically as a routine. And if the goverment had such control over the funding of the media, wouldnt they be showing the "truth" about covid and the gov? And the nurses are happy, because they would have treated their sick, and now would finally catch a break, after over a year of harsh work. btw one hospital doesent represent the country, and I also after a quick search, I found multiple headlines about how those videos were fake.</p>

        <p>The “funding” was the government paying for TV time, financing “artists” paying for movies, theater, projects, etc. </p>
<p>Projects like the play where some college students were sticking their fingers in the butthole one of another (“Macaquinhos”), and stuff like that. </p>
<p>The truth is that. The actual government is hated by all the corrupt establishment of Brazil and is being attacked 24/7. The opposition doesn’t propose anything to help the country. Anything. All they do is try to remove the president and do actions to minimize his strength for the 2022 election. Fucking joke. </p>
<p>That’s the Brazil scenario. The psdb even fucking allied with the pt!! Want anything more obvious than that?!</p>

        <p>Tv time in Brazil doesent work like that. You have to pay a concession to the gov to get it, not a monthly fee. The “artists” are also financed by the media itself, and the media pays the movie makers/owner for the right to stream it, not the government. And the media is also one of the sectors of the economy that suffered the least from the pandemic, therefore not needing as much/ any government bail out. The current government is a part of the “corrupt establishment of Brasil” And given by its disastrous diplomatic and economic decisions, its many scandals, and its poor handling of the pandemic, it’s no wonder people want him out. Not only the opposition, but most of the people aswell. You can say whatever you want, but his support base has been significantly reduced since his election. And it is no wonder that the 2 of the most leftist parties made a coalition against the current government. It is called politics.</p>

        <p>You do realize that op wasn't present a single source saying that this video was from nurses saying that the media was lying about the amount of deaths right ? , I really doubt this video is true because many MANY nurses here on brazil were taking videos here to Congratulate that the intensive care was finally empty and that all the patients that were sick to the point of intubation were finally cured.</p>
