    <strong>Common sense</strong>
    <p><p>What do we now know?
1. The PCR test inventor said his test should never be used for diagnosing—only for research because it can find anything if you run enough cycles. At 40 cycles the false positive rate is 97%. We lowered the cycles from 40 to 28 on January 20, 2021. We do not know for sure the proper cycles to determine infectious people, but best guesstimates are 25 or below.
2. Never in history, including the last year, can asymptomatic people spread and drive a respiratory illness. People with a high enough viral load to spread it are symptomatic.
3. See number two. Healthy people wearing masks is theatre...and control... and psychological manipulation. 
4. Illnesses are spread where there are symptomatic people (like hospitals) and in places where the population is high risk (like care homes.) Symptomatic people typically don’t go grocery shopping. That’s why lockdowns don’t work.
5. No toxicology studies were done before EUA. The spike is a pathogenic protein that millions are now making in their bodies. We now know it does not stay within the shoulder and nearby lymph but is traveling throughout peoples bodies. We do not know the long term effects but short term we know it’s causing blood/cardiovascular problems and nervous system problems and menstrual cycle challenges in women. It’s also triggering latent viruses like shingles.
6. People who have had SARs or MERS or a common cold have t-cells that also fight off this version. T-cell immunity is long lasting. It’s stronger than antibody protection and a large subset of the population have that type of immunity. Especially if they got the illness this time around. They do not need the jab.
7. The passports are a technological control mechanism that can also be used for medical records, banking information, digital ID, etc. He who controls the passport data controls the world. Look up the social credit system in China. Know that in Venezuela you can’t get your drivers license if you don’t have EVERY SINGLE JAB on the adult jab schedule. Those two countries were the testing grounds. 
We are at the precipice...

Also the majority of deaths could have been prevented with early treatment. Many doctors have had great success treating people with ivermectin and hydroxychloraquin. Turning away sick people and telling them to wait until they get worse is a crime against humanity. Everyone should have access to these medications as they save lives.</p></p>
