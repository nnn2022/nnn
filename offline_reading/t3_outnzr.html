    <strong>Another quote from 1984</strong>
    <p><p>“Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party  seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good  of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure  power means you will understand presently. We are different from the  oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the  others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites.  The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in  their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own  motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had  seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around  the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and  equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with  the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end.  One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a  revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the  dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of  torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to  understand me.”</p></p>
