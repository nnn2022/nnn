    <strong>Waiting for the shoe to drop</strong>
    <p><p>I've noticed a big lull in news over the past few months. We aren't talking about cases per day or deaths. We aren't talking about new or old restrictions. We aren't saying "x country is doing this, y country is doing that". We aren't talking about politics.</p>
<p>Here's what I think is happening. There are two parties who don't realize that they exist as parties. How could they? Most people live in a news bubble. Most people don't even <em>see</em> other people in real life, since they're stuck at home more or less. </p>
<p>These two parties are very far apart in their expectations, and we're still waiting for the shoe to drop on that. One party thinks we can just wait until everyone is vaccinated before opening up, despite the fact that almost 50% of people don't want the vaccine. The other party just wants to return to normal. Nothing seems to be urging the two to make a decision. Maybe summer weather will, but I won't hold my breath. My guess is something urgent financially will be the tipping point.</p>
<p>Thoughts on the slowing of the news, as well as the stagnancy of any political effort to remove the mandates?</p></p>

        <p>I think the lull is due to a kind of stalemate. The vax lovers are busy scheduling their vax and thinking the end is just around the corner, and the ones who don’t want the vaccine are in two camps: those who are going to stay masked up forever, and people like us. </p>
<p>The people like us are feeling exhausted by their resistance, and furthermore, the media doesn’t want to report on the opinions/ideas of people like us.</p>

        <p>My theory is that the National cases are dropping because the vaccine works on aggregate. But they don’t want to give up the power until they can get another stimulus print job and the vaccine passports.</p>
<p>If they victory lap the vaccine people won’t be afraid anymore. </p>
<p>I’ve thought the Georgia drama was to get people to stop talking about the border and to stop talking about covid until they can conjure up some other artificial news story</p>

        <p>I think they changed the PCR cycle count for tests right when Biden took office. I also think cases were going to drop no matter what. So, hard to prove anything about the vaccine without getting into a lot of specifics.</p>
<p>&rt; If they victory lap the vaccine people won’t be afraid anymore. </p>
<p>Damned if they, damned if they don't. They promote it, and people won't be scared. They don't promote it, and people won't get it.</p>
