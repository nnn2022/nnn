    <strong>so unfair</strong>
    <p><p>i‚Äôm fairly young but i‚Äôm old enough to get up and leave the house to do whatever i want whenever i need to. my bestfriend who is the same age as me has been locked up &amp;  i was the first person she‚Äôs seen since october 2020 and i saw her in june. so do the math. </p>
<p>her parents are literally keeping her in the house, she‚Äôs not allowed to see anyone, she already has a really hard time socializing and i noticed when we did go out that one time she was so out of it and barely remembered how to speak or react to being around people. now today, we were supposed to go out for food and some drinks and my car is in the shop so i‚Äôm not driving i told her i‚Äôd split an uber but she‚Äôs like she can‚Äôt take an uber her parents won‚Äôt let her. she then tells me they have cameras all over her house now so she can‚Äôt even leave without everyone checking. we were on facetime and i could literally see the hurt in her face. how do people not see how this behaviour is affecting their kids?!. 
trapped in a house as a biology major, just sitting at her computer all day long with no human interaction outside of her sister,mom, and dad. </p>
<p>so sad.</p></p>

        <p>that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm saying. i don‚Äôt want to say this to her because i don‚Äôt want her to take offence but i already know she feels the same way. i‚Äôm just not the type to talk about people‚Äôs parents if it‚Äôs not anything necessarily positive. 
i feel horrible man. it‚Äôs like her social skills have declined so much when they weren‚Äôt even all that high. of course she could talk but she‚Äôs very closed off and shy if she doesn‚Äôt know you but i find that she‚Äôs kind of acting that way towards me too now. i try to talk to her as often as i can but she‚Äôs either studying and i‚Äôm probably working so it never usually works out. i don‚Äôt know, i wish i could save her. she was also telling me how when she goes back to school her mom doesn‚Äôt want her going to the grocery store and wants her to order groceries to her residence instead‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. like WTF!</p>

        <p>She will have to break those chains herself, it‚Äôs going to be her choice whether or not to find independence. The only thing you can really do is let her know that you are there for her. Usually getting into family business like that you‚Äôll either lose a friend outright , or she will fall out with her parents and place the blame on you. It‚Äôll be a lose , lose situation for you. Just be a friend, whether it‚Äôs just a text message everyday to say hi , or an hour phone call just talking. Sometimes people just need to know someone is there &amp; that‚Äôs enough.</p>

        <p>You‚Äôre welcome , just to be clear this advise comes from experience and I‚Äôm not just talking out my ass.For six years a fifteen minute phone call once a week or a letter in mail once every two weeks meant more to me than anything , it was my anchor to the outside world , it was my sanity , it was my hope. Never underestimate how important the simplest things can be to another person. Best of luck to you &amp; you friend ‚úäüèª</p>
