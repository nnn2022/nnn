    <strong>Article on why mRNA "vaccines" were deadly to animals</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://regenerativemc.com/thursday-4-8-2021-what-happened-in-the-animal-trials-for-mrna-vaccines/">https://regenerativemc.com/thursday-4-8-2021-what-happened-in-the-animal-trials-for-mrna-vaccines/</a></p>
<p>This author tries to make sense of a 2012 report on animal testing. I don't understand much of it, but this sounds clear enough:</p>
<p>"The results from this study showed as Th2 immunity triggered by the vaccines increased, the bodyâ€™s defense system was pushed out of balance and this reaction started to cause tissue breakdown in the lung."</p>
<p>Sounds like they messed with an immune system developed over millions, and it went horrible wrong. I can't believe they're giving something with this kind of track record to billions of people without years of extensive testing, it's absurd.</p>
<p>What's more, the article states that the adverse reaction is specific to the virus. That means that people who get the virus after being vaccinated might have a more extreme reaction. At first the vaccine works as promised and keeps them safe, but if say a new variant breaks through, the antibodies go into overdrive and destroy the host instead of protecting it.</p>
<p>That's an important thought, because in places where the virus isn't present, people getting vaccinated would basically be dousing themselves in gasoline before going on a holiday into a burning house...</p>
<p>This stuff is starting to sound radioactive. It's a medical Chernobyl, and they're offering us free rides to get a closer look.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, all these guinea pigs walking around, after injecting a virus they may or may not have fought off naturally, will now become super spreaders of the variant strains.</p>
