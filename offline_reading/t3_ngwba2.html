    <strong>How do you deal with 'friends'?</strong>
    <p><p>How do you deal with friends - I mean close personal friends - who you really care about and have had a significant history with - who are entertaining some or any of the Covid - 19 'crisis/emergency'? I look upon the whole thing as a genocide - and the deployment of any imaginative ideation into 'accepting' or 'believing' any part of it - as an active, creative and proactive and energetic participation in the manifestation of the reality that we are experiencing. I regard any interaction in my personal life with any person who is participating in the creation of the genocide - as an active collusion on my part with it - therefore I have terminated relations with any and every friend whom has swallowed any of this junk. I have offered them no apology or explanation. I will not be taxed with any sense of obligation in the matter. These people are dead to me now and that is that.</p></p>

        <p>Luckily, most of my friends aren't the type to force their values on others.</p>
<p>If any of them had tried to coerce or shame me into getting the jab, they would no longer be my friend.</p>

        <p>To my surprise, one of them, which to my shame i always considered as not having a critical thinking, agreed with me when it comes to vaccines and the plandemic.The others, i just avoid talking about it because i would prolly feel the need to yell  as this whole thing was possible because  people like them, and they wont even realise it. Like i said from the start: for this virus you don`t need a microscope, just a simple mirror. We are the virus, both of us, because we could`ve done more from the start also. They used human nature against itself ..</p>

        <p>New friends.   I feel closer to people i’ve met this past year than those i’ve left that i’ve known my entire life.   New friends on the same page means there is no walking on egg shells.  no fake conversations.</p>

        <p>I dream of having IRL local friends where I could be "me" and be accepted and not walk on egg shells. It sucks. I had this 15 years ago. So know what it is like. America's changed for the worse even socially.</p>

        <p>There are several local groups in PA that are fighting against the agenda.   Some are more political than others.   Mainly it is just real people with similar anti lockdown, anti mask, anti bullshit vaccines, which really means they are normal.   </p>
<p>I do not know what area you are in but there is definitely groups in your area.   We really are the silent majority.    But that silence is ending.   The bear has been poked.</p>

        <p>For me it isn’t about right wing groups.  They suck just as bad as left wing groups.  Bush family is in the uniparty.    These groups are also made up of left wing people as well.  Real people that look at freedom and not through red/blue eyes.   It just happens red leaning aligns better on some of the freedom fronts, yet lack severely in other freedom areas.</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree too with thinking outside of the red and blue. You are right red leaning has some freedom fronts down better but IMO the 'go starve in the gutter" messages to those who don't win the Job and Capital Lotto, with endless trust in capitalism makes no sense, especially where things are today.</p>

Seems to be a bit less drastic than "terminating relationships without apology or explanation".</p>

        <p>But that is something pertinent - I mean - when I see something such as Covid on the TV. I can go on the internet and in less than 5 minutes I can see that it is all just rubbish. If they are so afraid - why do they not seek reassurance? Do you know? I mean how long was it before you worked it out that this is a scam?</p>

        <p>I wish I knew. I don't think they want reassurance. They've bought the whole narrative and don't seem to want to give it up now. No source I give them is worthy enough it seems. Took me about 3-4 months before the veil started to lift. Spent the first two in blind fear worried for my wife with asthma.</p>

        <p>I mean If I was worried about a virus - I would go to the official figures and see who is dying. That is what I did. Once I saw that nobody is dying apart from the people who usually die from colds and flu i.e. (terminal ill and end of life due to old age). I was not worried any more. The info that exposes the malevolence of this atrocity is all there in the mainstream. You don't have to go to the 'conspiracy domain' at all. If you are prepared to recognize it - you have to accept that you are responsible for your life - and that the government is lying. Maybe that is just too frightening. But these people you know - they all know this subconsciously - on that level - they are fully aware - and they are too weak and terrified and mentally and emotionally crippled to stand up an be counted. That is eating their souls alive. There is a lake of fire waiting for them.</p>

        <p>You just have to honestly ignore it. If they can’t see what’s going on it’s not our jobs to preach to them. I have plenty of friends (most) and family who are all about the vaccine but we still have so much in common. If it gets brought up, I just let them talk about it while I remain silent unless I’m directly asked. </p>

        <p>I don’t talk about it. If the conversation drifts in that direction, I get up and grab a beer. Or change the record. If the conversation is still the same when I get back, I interrupt it by introducing a new topic.</p>

        <p>I ignore it and avoid the nnn/c19 topic as much as possible and try to enjoy their company. If they insist on bringing it up I'll take a break from them for a while. I'd have no friends if I cut everyone out of my life who disagrees with me about something. I find everything going on suspect AF and likely nefarious but I also accept maybe I'm wrong.</p>

        <p>This really doesn't seem healthy. You're destroying life long friendships over conspiracy theories, full scorched earth.</p>
<p>If you truly believe that's the best option then you do you, but take care of your mental health in the long run and try to find a new group of real life friends. Remember to keep yourself tethered to reality.</p>
