        <p>Ya know, it's gonna make me very happy when all those mods have egg on thier face when we find out the virus was man-made in a lab. I'm.not saying that that's definitely what happened, or that bill gates made the virus, but like, I'm just saying china been eating bats and armidillos since I was a kid, why now? Two years after the US pulled our aid money from virile research in all the countries we were providing it too? It just so happens that a natural virus pops up from a wet market? Naw, this was an intentional virus and an accidental exposure.</p>

        <p>Very true, but to be fair, I've had a few of my posts deleted here, but most just get downvoted to oblivion. </p>
<p>Like I agree, no one should be forced to get the vaccine, or be limited to home gatherings, that's a personal choice, if you don't want to celebrate a holiday with your family then stay away from them, nor do I think we should be shutting down businesses or locking people in thier homes. If you're afraid of catching an airborne disease, just don't go to the fucking bar. </p>
<p>But any time someone complains about wearing a mask, I'm just like, is it that bad? Like I have asthma and where one, when it first broke out I wasn't taking any chances cause I don't trust the government when they said we don't need to wear masks, and I was rocking a gas mask. I do agree that personal freedoms are important, but I still think it's a good idea to wear one and not need it, than to need it and not be wearing it. Just like a pistol. Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>But I've got to hand it to the folks that say stuff like "it's not about masks specifically, it's about being obedient, that's what the government wants." 
But if that was the case, if it was just about not being a mindless drone to the government, how come nobody was wearing a mask when the government said not to?  It takes some amazing skills of mental gymnastics to make some of these jumps.</p>
<p>And what's even dumber, I just saw a post where dude admitted he was to much of a pussy to not wear a mask, but would walk out of a store because they had a sign explaining how and why they required them, if you go to a private business, and they have a formal dress code, how can you talk about Rights but then not back up that businesses right to refuse service. I guess to him, pussies are marginalized minorities that needs special legal protection.</p>

        <p>That fine if you have that opinion, you're probably right that the masks are just a security blanket to make people feel more safe. nothing is 100% short of a full hazmat suit and even then exposure happens. </p>
<p>But how you gonna call someone a moron from a smurf account?</p>

        <p>i personally find masks to really make me dizzy with lack of air very quickly, and i’m a pretty in shape guy who runs hills for fitness.    Also I would be more open to the austerity of masks if there were clear inflection in deaths or “the numbers” after mask mandates, WHICH I HAVE SEEN JACK FUCKING SHIT OF, and the best studies that are pro-mask use a lot of “might” or “could reduce” language while the only actual RCT studying masks and covid showed no benefit.  maybe i need one of those spandex masks, but for me covering my breathing hole has been one of the most unreasonable requests put upon me, especially as the PCR testing has show. a sloppy false positive prone methodology, the death accounting has loosely included anyone dying of a heart attack or aneurism with a positive test within 30 days, and the average age of death is 82.  pretty tall order to tell me to breath through non breathable cloth even for 30 minutes.</p>

        <p>I mean, that's crazy cause I has asthma and smoke often and have no trouble with cloth masks unless I'm like, in an already hot area and doing alot of moving around, but yeah get a thinner mask. </p>
<p>Like I've said, I don't think masks do much mechanically to stop the virus, but they are a security blanket for the ignorant masses, and keep any tough guy cops off your ass(not that cops have done shit to enforce anything at all where I'm at). </p>
<p>I think that masks can definitely reduce the chances, if worn properly, and across a bigger percent of people than what we're currently seeing. But with people not even trying, I don't think masks will do anything but make some people feel better, so they arent doing nothing. I'd wager if worn properly, by a larger percent of people, and done with a little more care for social distancing, we'd see results of decline more similar to other countries. I can't think of what else others are doing differently other than total lockdowns, but even in places where they aren't doing lockdowns, were still generally doing worse. But to assume masks don't work when over half the population won't even give them the chance, and the other half don't know how to wear them properly, is just moronic. A gun won't do much with no bullets either...</p>
<p>I definitely agree with what constitutes a covid death is way to fast and loose, but even if only half are accurate, that's still greater than one out of every 2000 US citizens dying.  Even if it's a quarter, that's still close to 1/1300, which the flu death rate is 1/6620 in the US. </p>
<p>The testing is pointless imo, that's why I don't even consider cases for death ratio, but unfortunately, because testing is so bad(casual 15 minute and 2 day tests, which constitute most of the testing going on have an accuracy rating of around 30%, so it it's safe to assume 1/4 of the death have to be accurate. </p>
<p>The biggest thing is, it's always been a good idea to wear a mask in the winter. And not just in the winter but the rest of the year as well. Not just because of the flu, but also because of the number of epidemics since the early 2000s.</p>

        <p>For me, I'll give you that but only because I rarely have worse than a mild attack(and I smoke), and also the fever with bacterial infections is worse. Otherwise I'd say they're the same. Especially because like, how many times a month are you getting pneumonia? Because I've known some people who get very bad attacks several times a month who'd adamantly disagree with that, and for them, I think they'd be correct.</p>
<p>But also, what does that have to do with the price of oranges in Antarctica?</p>

        <p>The point I was making is that extended mask wear, without proper cleaning, of cloth masks that are not medical grade can lead to bacterial pneumonia and other respiratory infections. I'd definitely take an asthma attack over that.</p>

        <p>How extended are you talking? Are you implying something like that could happen in less than a day of wear, or are you saying you don't wash your clothes after you wear them? I just don't think you could get a bacterial infection from wearing a mask for a 12 hour period, idk, I'm not a doctor but  I've worked a 12 hour shift in a hot and wet working environment and while my mask was pretty funky, it was fine later that night after I washed it.</p>

        <p>I don't think many people have an issue with people choosing to wear masks or even private businesses choosing to require them, what they have a problem with is state mandates forcing businesses and individuals to wear masks with threats. If it was a recommendation, then that's fine, I just won't go in any business that requires them, but when they are forced on the businesses in question, many people are then saying well, now if I choose not to go there I'm punishing the business for a decision that wasn't under their control anyway. That isn't my view, I refuse to wear a mask full stop and if you deny me access to your business on those grounds, then I won't use your business, I have no issues with it, but I can also see that point of view from others in this sub too.</p>

        <p>There was actually a study out of Melbourne reported on Sky News Australia in which the lead scientist said there was a 90 percent chance the virus was man-made, as its genetic makeup did not match a virus which would have been transferred from and it seemed to have been specifically designed for human infection. This was a university-led study that came out in May or June btw, just no one payed attention to it cause it didn't fit the narrative.</p>

        <p>I cannot stand how the narrative is that if you don't think masks work as advertised, you are a redneck. No wonder we are where we are now. Plenty of intelligent individuals question the mask narrative. Doesn't make you a conspiracy theorist or anything. People are allowed to question shit...especially when a situation such as this disrupts everything in your life.</p>
