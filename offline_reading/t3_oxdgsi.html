    <strong>Just a rant about the state of mind we face each day; the "us vs them" and a glimmer of hope [LONG]</strong>
    <p><p>I am not trying to address this to the "ur unvaxxed i wish you die" type of people. You cannot reason with them. They're right, I accept that. With that out of the way, take some water or drink of choice and let's start. </p>
<p>I usually don't want to point fingers and divide by us and them or even etiquette them as this or that, but I often times question myself how can someone be so radical about (mis)information spread by governments and mainstream media? </p>
<p>Since when did we agree that the mainstream media and the governments are responsible for which information is right or wrong? And that anyone who questions and opposes them is the conspiracy theorist and spreading misinformation? They were and still are the epicenter of misinformation and contradictory stories. What has changed so that you can rely on what they're saying? Genuinely curious. </p>
<p>How can someone take such (critical) (mis)information without any solid research to base their facts on something? Heck, if someone says even the most banal thing that I haven't heard of I would hesitate from giving an opinion on it since I barely know anything about. Then, if it peaks my interest I will do the work and gather as much information as possible in order to not sound like an idiot next time. </p>
<p>I'm under the impression that they're living in some virtual, fictional bubble of "facts" that they want to believe in. And I know they most likely say the same about us, but from an objective point of view we know who's more likely to get real information. And this is not speaking from a biased perspective, but I strongly believe that majority on this sub do base their opinions on facts because we're so open about it.</p>
<p>Just look at the amount of flairs we have. We're open to anyone sharing their general objective view, while the most (bot) populated sub-reddits that are pro vaccine only have biased flairs. In some you can't even share your bad experience or even ask a legitimate question. Ever questioned - why? Or maybe you're afraid of being called a conspiracy theorist for trying to have an answer to a legit question? How is that different than fascism? </p>
<p>Try to think about it like so: which emperor wants to keep the traitors and fools in their empire? It's basically snitch and ditch, because they fear the snitches may turn their back against them for the more powerful ones, just like they did when they help them for some incentive. Don't be that orchestrated Orc. They're trying to enforce social engineering to a point where you start ignoring true information and point your fingers at us. And that's exactly their point. To make you think that it's someone else's fault, where in reality it's their fault. It's their business. To make you feel good about taking the experimental, non-approved vaccine. They're slowly creeping into your personal lives, finances, medical information etc. Trying to make you their slave and to be depended on their mercy, which is completely alienating from the idea of how the government should function like. </p>
<p>We know you're aware of the fact that they lied in multiple occasions about everything related to the vaccine. From its safety to the fact that you were about to be back not wearing a mask or following any measure that's forced upon us, the unvaccinated. You don't have to live with that burden on your shoulders each and every day you go on Reddit or (anti)social media and type something against the unvaccinated, but deep down you know the problem has other roots to begin with. Ask nicely and precisely and many of us are open to give you the proper information. Say it. Be loud about it. Then watch that same circle of people who wish you "the best" turn against you in an instant. A friend or someone with good intentions will never do that. </p>
<p>It's kinda dystopian, but at the same time encouraging because I think that the saying:</p>
<p>&rt;Hard times create strong men, Strong men create good times, Good times create weak men, Weak men create hard times.</p>
<p>Got its full cycle and now it's time to repeat itself. We are destined to be "the strong men" from the saying. No disrespect to the women here, it's just how the saying goes to get the point.</p>
<p>United we stand, divided we fall. Don't let it be too late. Truth will always find its place. Stay strong and keep fighting against what they came for! It's yours and deserved. I do not wish any death to anyone. Everyone has an equal opportunity to show their value. Some of you may even find a cure to cancer or HIV. Never let some politician set the price tag on you. Never undervalue yourself. </p>
<p>Thanks all who made it here one way or another through my (most likely) badly structured/worded rant. I'm not a native English speaker. I probably missed a lot of points and that's where I invite everyone who's open for an objective, rational discussion to join and exchange opinions and such.  </p>
<p>Have a good day everyone!</p></p>
