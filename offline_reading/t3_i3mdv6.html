        <p><a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/full-shutdown-us/">From an article</a> linked in here on what would be a "full shutdown" in the US:</p>
<p>&rt; "A full shutdown would mean that everyone in the entire country stays at home for four to six weeks," writes Leana S. Wen, MD, in an opinion piece for The Washington Post. This isn't the only option, Wen says, but rather one of three ways forward—and easily the most aggressive. In this scenario, she continues, "Those already infected would spread the virus only to their immediate households. If no one has additional contacts, we collectively starve the virus and stop transmission."</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; As Wen notes, however, doing nothing is no longer a real possibility. "There will be a breaking point," she writes.</p>
<p>I still believe they are gunning for a second round of lockdowns. There's many organizations pushing for this, and even a good chunk of the population is also begging for "tougher restrictions" and outright locking down states. The only way to stop it is for people to fight against it, problem is, there just isn't enough pushback at the moment. It's crazy how much fear people have, and how hung up on the "dangers of the virus" they seem to be.</p>

        <p>Sounds like something that works great on paper but isn’t practical irl. I mean I know I’m not an epidemiologist (With an opinion that fits the narrative) so my common sense doesn’t matter....But how can you 100% ensure everyone stays inside for 4+ weeks? Even in Wuhan it was still spreading. They would have to shutdown essential services, no going to the grocery store, no mail, no emergency services, nothing. And then doing it across a diverse population with many states and land borders. It’s a fantasy. </p>
<p>Then there’s the fact it’s dystopian af.</p>

<p>Because it's not about curbing the spread at all. What this <em>will</em> achieve is more control of the populace, and drive more people into desperation that will lead to suicides, panic, and other problems that will probably spur the government to "help". Another full lockdown like this will destroy the economy once and for all, and probably lead to government intervention that will bring about more societal changes. Who knows, we may get a UBI that people have wanted even before, a UBI with likely many, <em>many</em> strings attached as well...</p>

        <p>&rt; The only catch? You have to be wearing the masks before symptoms emerge in the first person infected in your household. "Face mask use by the primary case and family contacts before the primary case developed symptoms was 79 percent effective in reducing transmission," the researchers note.</p>
<p>Notice how they are now pushing for masks at home as well. I've been seeing more and more masks in my neighborhood, as in, people wearing them in their own homes and yards.</p>
<p>I see some people still in denial, and trying to write this off as foolish politicians and doctors just trying to "mean well", and not "looking at the right numbers". I...disagree. A lot. Entirely. No, this is higher-ups trying to usher in a "new way of life", aka a "New Normal". It sounds crazy, I know, but they want humans to now cover half their faces. The reasoning for this? I think a lot of it is psychological, as a means for people to dehumanize and distrust each other. No more smiles, no more kissing, no more looking at faces, no more physical attraction, and so forth.</p>

        <p>Many are in denial of the dystopian hellscape being created with intention before us. When you have organizations like the World Economic Forum and countless governors and other powerful figures relentlessly pushing the Great Reset and New Normal, I’m not sure how the naivety continues.</p>
<p>The writing is on the wall. They are in no way trying to hide their plans. The new year is going to be an extremely blackpilling period for everyone insisting that once the US elections pass this will all be over. I feel somewhat sorry for them.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I've seen official government documents (posted the one for Washington state's pandemic plan here) that state this will go on into 2021 or even 2022. I've seen lots of "hints" that they intend to keep this going for the foreseeable future. Seems like even when the vaccine is available, they intend to keep masks around as well (see the CovidPass informational video, wherein the actors portrayed as traveling in 2021 are seen with masks on, as they use their CovidPasses as vaccination proof).</p>

        <p>I...never wanted to live in a dystopia, and I still don't. I say this as someone who enjoyed dystopian fiction (and always saw them as cautionary tales, not shit to be emulated or romanticized...). The idea that we may approach a collapse fills me with terror, and hopelessness.</p>

        <p>Oh I agree. I never wanted to live in a dystopia either, that's why my favorite part is when the people fight back. An actual apocalyptic collapse might be preferable to a totalitarian dystopia. At least then we might have a chance, a fresh start to rise up out of the ashes and maybe not fuck up so bad again. I would rather a thousand years of anarchy than one day of tyranny.</p>
