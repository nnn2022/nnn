    <strong>I don‚Äôt speak for all of us here</strong>
    <p><p>but the high number of deleted comments on this subreddit have made me wary. </p>
<p>I want to start off by saying I have no idea what it entails to be a mod of a hyper controversial subreddit, but common sense tells me it is hard as fuck. So thanks for doing the work. Seriously. </p>
<p>With that being said, I hate censorship. Hate it hate it. Most of us here have experienced the frustration and demoralization of taking our time and energy to put a comment together only to have it removed, sometimes resulting in a temporary or perma ban. It sucks. And while it feels reallllly good to give our critics a taste of their own medicine, I think we all know the old annoying saying ‚Äútwo wrongs don‚Äôt make a right‚Äù. There is also the simple truth that censoring comments of our haters(even the mean shitty ones) only give more ammo to use against us. </p>
<p>In my humble, and often wrong opinion, I think our weird little misfit virtual community here has the intelligence and common sense to navigate through the trolls wisely. We all want freedom of speech and freedom of expression, and in that comes a great deal of risk that assholes show up. Showing them compassion and listening might actually change some hearts as opposed to confirming their assumptions that we suck. Most of us want to be heard, and some of us have really toxic ways of saying things. We don‚Äôt want to enable that shit, but we don‚Äôt need it wiped away for us. We are all grown ups, and can be trusted to make the choice on who we want to give our energy to. And in my experience, ignoring bullies almost always makes them go away. </p>
<p>Well, there‚Äôs my two cents :) I appreciate the shit out of you all here. This subreddit has helped remind me I‚Äôm not the only crazy one, and thank God. I was starting to lose hope their for a bit.</p></p>

        <p>I like what you said, but this is reddit.  People will literally come over here and make comments just for the purpose of getting this sub banned, and it will be... eventually.  But yeah, props to the mods.</p>

        <p>There are two ways any conversation can go. One way is to be constructive and respectful of the opposing party, and the other is to completely condemn and cuss out others for having a different opinion. The people who generally disagree with this sub react in the latter way.</p>
<p>Almost every sub you find will have guidelines, and to be respectful is one of them. It‚Äôs wild to me how people can‚Äôt have a level-headed conversation/discussion regarding topics they seem to disagree with. No one is telling those people to come on this sub and be a pro-vaccine evangelist. 90% of the individuals who come here with opposing views are absolutely disrespectful and are in no way looking to have a civil discussion on this topic.</p>
<p>Yes, censorship sucks, and it seems that our side gets censored a LOT seeming how there ARE lots of scientific articles and studies out there contradicting this entire pandemic, but this is a sub with rules, and they‚Äôre simple to follow. Most can‚Äôt seem to follow those rules, resulting in a ban. It‚Äôs not hard to be an and be level-headed with one another even when they disagree with something.</p>

        <p>I totally hear you and largely agree. Where I have a hard time is in the statement regarding sub rules. Because again, we aren‚Äôt known for being a bunch of rule followers here, hence the strife. I wander through the nnn ban sites on occasion in an effort to get more perspective and one thing that I see as a reoccurring theme is that many of the people on there joined because they got booted here. Likely for being complete ass hats, because like you mentioned, that is the usual response we get. But I can‚Äôt help but feel (maybe naively) that if we simply behaved as we do in the real world and ignore the shit heads and engage with the people who show maturity through disagreement then we might have a better chance at bridging some gaps between all of us. </p>
<p>Also I‚Äôm a weirdo who thinks assholes can sometimes be our best teachers. Not usually in the information they offer but in the patience and grace we sometimes learn through our uncomfortable interactions with them. Obviously there are occasions to delete, but I would appreciate seeing more discernment.</p>

        <p>Well said. I try not to engage with trolls but occasionally, if my mood is right/wrong I can't resist having a dig at someone.</p>
<p>As far as censorship against us, I've had a couple of pictures removed in the last 2 days, neither of which were in any way offensive. They were just funny. Anyway, whatever. I appreciate this sub too and all who sail in her and I often talk about what a great community it is to people I meet IRL.</p>
