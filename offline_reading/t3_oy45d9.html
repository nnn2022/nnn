    <strong>Wen did you know covid was a bunch of BS?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not saying BS, in that the virus is fake, but rather that is was over blown and endlessly politicized </p>
<p>for me it was the night i got out of jail(at the end of 2019 to beginning of 2020 i spent 3 months in jail)</p>
<p>i stayed at my grand paretns house and my grandpa was watching fox news </p>
<p>the anchor kept repeating the phrase " the corona virus" over and over... and at that moment i was like " ahhhh shit, here we go" </p>
<p>you can get a lot of information, not truth, but information about any given agenda from watching MSM...</p>
<p>remember how they covered pizzagate, or the 2016 election, ect... if you have a keen eye you can see through them very easily, and know what they're up to</p></p>

        <p>From the very beginning. When I learned about the misuse of the pcr, how hospitals were being incentivized to mislabel deaths, when they started repeating "the new normal". It was clear it was to seize power, to crush small and medium sized businesses, to make billions off vaccines and thereby insuring future sickness, and it's been a catalyst for the Great Reset.</p>

        <p>When my wife got it around Thanksgiving of 2020 and had loss of taste and nothing else. Oh yeah and I didn't catch it from her. Both of us went and had blood draws to test for antibodies the following week and she had them but I didn't so somehow I'm immune to it.</p>

        <p>I was skeptical from the start, but I said to myself, "Okay, maybe I'm wrong", and I went along with the restrictions of the spring of 2020. But when my state's governor upped our lockdowns for the SECOND time, I said nope. And it's been a hard no ever since.</p>

        <p>When I heard the term "New Normal" in February 2020 being touted in several places, and thought, "well, isn't that a strange terminology to use for something that isn't even here in this country yet"?</p>

        <p>I took it seriously for a few weeks after they made us lock down and not go to work. Then I realized how overblown the entire thing was based on the stats and have been « woke » ever since. So I guess April 2020.</p>

        <p>I knew we were in for some serious shit the 3rd week of February 2020 when I went to visit my parents for a week and ALL the news talked about was the corona virus. I didn’t know lockdowns were coming but I knew something was up. I was skeptical after the lockdowns came and I knew we were being lied to and manipulated when the world broke out in protects after George Floyd died. I noticed that the same people who demanded we all stay home, from the people to the politicians, were all out protesting with thousands of others. Then the media and the health experts supported the protests and said they were good for the health of the country and that’s when I knew. It was never about our health and the people telling us to worry about covid weren’t worried.</p>
