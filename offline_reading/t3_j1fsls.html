        <p>Translation of news, emphases mine</p>
<p><strong>News</strong>: "<em>The early results in Florida show the success of rigorous mask wearing, social distancing, isolating contacts and quick contact tracing when necessary</em>, health experts said."</p>
<p><strong><em>Translation</em></strong>: FL looks successful only when we look at any data that can be made to look like it reflects our narrative.</p>
<p><strong>News</strong>: "Although things went well early, the experts cautioned that schools could still be the source of future problems. <em>They warned against reading the data</em> as a reason to reopen all schools or abandon safety measures."</p>
<p><strong><em>Translation</em></strong>: We need to only read data that agree with our narrative.</p>
<p><strong>News</strong>: "Despite the bright spots in the data showing school-age cases declining from their summertime peak, there was <em>one troubling trend</em>: The rate of decline slowed in many places after schools reopened."</p>
<p><strong><em>Translation</em></strong>: We are really trying to scare you when there's nothing to fear.</p>
<p><strong>News:</strong> That might mean cases have plateaued and schools have not fueled new, large outbreaks. <em>Or it might mean those counties are at the bottom of a U and could soon turn upward again</em>."</p>
<p><strong><em>Translation</em></strong>: Seriously, we need you to be afraid so we get clicks.</p>
<p><strong>News:</strong> “'It’s one of those things where <em>it’s not a problem until there is a problem</em>,'”</p>
<p><strong><em>Translation</em></strong>: Be scared, damn it!</p>
<p><strong>News:</strong> "<em>Health researchers and educational experts watch Florida</em> for cues about what works to keep students, staff and the broader community safe amid a pandemic."</p>
<p><strong><em>Translation:</em></strong> Experts, fearing that things will be fine in FL, really hope that numbers don't look good so they can tout their narrative.</p>

        <p>Not an anti masker but this line of logic is fucking stupid. It’s a pandemic, a worldwide infection. Unless we implemented precautions early enough some people were going to die regardless of our response. The American response <em>COULD</em> have been better and we <em>MIGHT</em> have prevented more unnecessary deaths. But if your only point is “people are dying” you might as well not even post anything. It’s tired, and it’s trite. Anyone who has a shred of knowledge regarding disease and epidemiology know that people die in outbreaks, otherwise there never would have been an outbreak. </p>
<p>Also, fuck this sub. Grow the fuck up and realize that your personal freedoms end the second they do damage to another person. A. K.A. The right to swing your fist ends where my face begins.</p>
<p>Edit: Another thought, for people who are “I’m okay assuming the risk”. That’s fine if you want to treat your own health that way, but it’s the same deal with vaccinations, there are people who medically can’t consent to accept that risk. They rely on the rest of society to help carry some of the slack. “Quarantine them” I hear you say. Who the fuck is going to take care of them when they have to be quarantined? That person is now risking their family due to the fact that y’all wanna act like three year olds and throw a temper tantrum.</p>

        <p>&rt;Not an anti masker but this line of logic is fucking stupid.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that you made this comment.  </p>
<p>&rt;your personal freedoms end the second they do damage to another person. A. K.A. The right to swing your fist ends where my face begins.</p>
<p>Here, I respectfully disagree for several reasons. </p>
<p>But first and foremost, I do see your line of reasoning: it's certainly not a good society if its members are walking around actively trying to hurt, if not to kill, one another all day. I can also see this case made if someone is deliberately trying to infect people with diseases that bring certain death like rabies or a brain-eating amoeba. There's no way to even remotely classify COVID next to such diseases. For most folks, the survival rate is &rt; 99%. </p>
<p>If we open up the door to sue someone for allegedly giving COVID, we open up a legal can of worms. If I have the flu, give it to you, and you give it to someone very old who winds up dying from it, do their family have the right to sue you or me?    </p>
<p>&rt;there are people who medically can’t consent to accept that risk. They rely on the rest of society to help carry some of the slack. “Quarantine them” I hear you say. Who the fuck is going to take care of them when they have to be quarantined? That person is now risking their family</p>
<p>So with this line of thought, should we just be making the lockdown rules permanent so these high risk individuals never die? </p>
<p>And I don't think we need to inconvenience society as a whole due to that. I can speak from my experience having epilepsy for 16 years (though thankfully for me, it's been controlled for a long time now). This condition adds risk to almost every activity I do. It also legally prevents me from doing some things, like driving (although I got these privileges back eventually). </p>
<p>Do I expect society to bend over backwards for me because I belong to a very small group of folks who happen to have a very rare medical condition? Absolutely not. If this minority of people really wants most to place their lives on hold for so long, to miss graduations, cancel weddings, attend school, because their life has more risk associated with it, that's on them. </p>
<p>And yes, <em>they</em> should be the ones quarantined, not the rest of society. Risk in taking care of such folks will never be zero, so this point can be applied even if COVID never came into the picture.</p>

        <p>This is not a rare medical condition like epilepsy, for which there is a known treatment. So when you get rid of that false comparison the only thing left is your comment about the flu. It is common knowledge that masks help slow the spread (of a disease for which there is no vaccine nor confirmed treatment). If you were to knowingly have the flu and go out and infect people you could potentially be legally liable if someone died. There are previous court cases against people who knowingly spread H.I.V. in which they were found legally culpable. If you knowingly ignore a measure that has been shown to slow the spread of this disease and you do spread it to someone who dies you are culpable whether you want to accept it or not. Legally speaking would be a matter of taking it to court to see which argument wins. </p>
<p>And whether you acknowledge it or not, wearing a face mask is not bending over backwards for society. Suggesting that immunocompromised people should be forced into isolation because “I don’t want to wear a mask” is forcing the smaller minority of society to bend for YOU. It would be a different story if we had a confirmed treatment (hydroxychloroquine is not approved or widely accepted; most hospitals will give remdesivir and azithromycin which has been hit or miss). So, I’ll ask nicely; please wear a mask out in public until we have a confirmed vaccine or treatment. Otherwise, you can respectfully kiss my ass.</p>

        <p>Who are these "experts?" You do realize that there are many experts out there on the topic, and many disagree with one another. You can't just take one of the many voices in a field and say that represents the entire thing. </p>
<p>Case in point: DeSantis <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/2020/09/24/desantis-roundtable-on-public-health/3515876001/">met with three experts</a> before making the decision to re-open.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&rt;The two-hour discussion with Dr. Jayanta Bhattacharya, a medical professor at Stanford University, Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a medical professor at Harvard University and Michael Levitt, a structural biology professor at Stanford University, revolved around the effectiveness of statewide and local government mask and social distancing mandates, testing and the role of “herd immunity” in the community.</p>
<p>So let's try this thought exercise: </p>
<p>Hypothetical headline 1: DeSantis met with professors from Stanford and Harvard and concluded that reopening is a bad idea. </p>
<p>Hypothetical headline 1: DeSantis met with professors from Stanford and Harvard and concluded that reopening is a good idea. </p>
<p>Which of these two are you more prone to believe?  </p>
<p>&rt;So you don't trust the experts. </p>
<p>No, I don't trust the experts that have been on CNN. Just because someone spent years studying a topic doesn't mean that they know 100% and are right 100% of the time. Being wrong is an important part of science. My trust waned when I saw how badly they misconstrued research to fit a particular narrative. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Instead, you're just gonna ignore the million people that have died from this worldwide and consider it a fluke or whatever?</p>
<p>I'm not ignoring it, but I am saying its lethality is overblown. Most folks who die fit a particular profile: old (ages 75+) and with pre-existing conditions. You can go on the CDC's COVID data portal and look at the demographic info yourself. Although \~7.7% of infections are ages 75+, that age group makes up \~58% of all deaths. Thousands more young people die in car accidents than of COVID. If the population were less obsese, we'd see a decline in deaths overall, including COVID. Yet, we are not telling people to eat healthy and exercise. </p>
<p>Not to mention the lives lost due to suicides and overdoses from these draconian shut downs. Do you consider those to be flukes? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And how would you explain previous waves, where masks and general medical knowledge regarding pandemics were ignored, but are finally being listened to, if it's such a small deal?</p>
<p>I challenge you to look at the trends of cases and deaths on the CDC website by state and try to guess when a mask mandate was implemented. </p>
<p>We've been ignoring general knowledge about pandemics since day one. <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.556.2672&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Here's a piece from 2006 on pandemics, co-authored by the guy who eradicated smallpox</a>.</p>

        <p>Dr. Jayanta Bhattacharya argues that Florida should be reopened because of how Sweden has done... </p>
<p>Sweden has had the highest rated of the Nordic countries when it comes to Covid. </p>
<p>I'm not sure why anyone should follow their methods. </p>
<p>And this is coming from someone whose grandparents in Sweden have gotten sick. Thankfully, they are on the younger side and will probably not die, but there is a chance and I don't like  the Swedish government for having done this to them.</p>

<p>Seriously, it's good news that this is getting out there, but I am certain that doomers will find a way to dismiss it.</p>
<p>Edit:  I just checked out the comments for the same story posted on r/CV.  No surprises except the diversity in reasons why we can dismiss the news.</p>

        <p>Deaths started to decline, so the focus shifted to cases.  If cases start to decline, I'm sure they will try to desperately grasp onto something else (or just start making up soon to be wildly inaccurate doomsday predictions [i.e. second wave!!!]) to scare people and extend this idiocy.</p>
