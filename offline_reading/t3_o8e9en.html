        <p>I don't think in pills, I think in terms of "how is walking around with a sign for almost 6 months while restrictions continue to be added seen as progress?" People are so desperate to protest but can't do the actual 'work' of not complying where it matters.</p>

        <p>Claim a medical exemption whenever you go inside a store or any other building. The employees have to let you go in unless they're willing to scream at you to leave, which hasn't happened to me in over 7 months. The worst that's happened was a very overweight 50 year old man getting belligerent and challenging me in a grocery store about where my mask was, although he wasn't an employee and specifically walked up to/past me to insist I "keep my distance" despite originally being nowhere near him. He tattled to the pharmacy employees, trying to get me kicked out, but they didn't do anything. After that, I sought out every rotating security guard who works there to enforce mask use and they all said I will never get kicked out, none of them care. Other than that, I've seen a few people pointing/talking about me in other places, but nothing happens. This is in Canada, the land of the pathetic, by the way. People don't care about starting a scene as much as you'd think.</p>
<p>Just me not wearing a mask hasn't done anything, I can't pretend I'm a freedom fighter or whatever because it's had no influence to do it alone. What would have influence is groups of people doing the same thing. Imagine seeing 20 people spread out (looking unrelated to each other) in a store, all not wearing a mask. Wouldn't someone begin to feel stupid for wearing one and contemplate taking it off? Presumably, there's no social punishment at that point to be the 21st person to stop complying. I can't get a single person to join me in doing this, so that's why I look at the massive enclaves of protestors who seemingly want to take action.</p>
<p>I'm criticizing everyone else because they're putting so much effort into something that hasn't had any real impact, when they could stop shouting into a void every weekend and just go about their lives while possibly convincing others into doing the same thing and slowly making it the norm. Protesting is in essence asking for permission, no matter how angry the participants are. Everyone says "this will never end" and yet keep asking for it to end, as if that's what would work when they readily admit that it can go on forever.</p>

        <p>I don’t know why people are disagreeing with you.</p>
<p>We’re 467 days into this shit and nothing we do is helping.</p>
<p>The time for real, concrete action was 6 months ago, but it’s not too late.</p>
<p>We all need to attend these protest events, but bring a bit more… spunk with us and go directly to our parliamentary and government offices and make these people listen to us, since asking hasn’t done shit.</p>
<p>No one will do this though, and that’s okay. We all have too much to lose: from jobs to houses, kids to wives/husbands, we’re not uncomfortable to the point of total revolt yet.</p>
<p>And that is by design with all of the government stimulus being chucked around, by the way.</p>
<p>Wait until this winter when these people really clamp our balls.</p>

        <p>The masks are a visual representation of the narrative of a "thing" happening, seeing them everywhere keeps the illusion going. Instead of walking around town and demanding the rules get lifted, just stop wearing them. Thousands of people on the street should be forming small groups and walking into stores without a mask to show everyone that they're not alone in not wanting to comply.</p>
<p>You're allowed to claim medical exemption from masks and most places will let you walk in, unless they're extremely paranoid and want to cause a scene. Why people are so afraid to do this as an individual, much less in a group of ten people is beyond me. The more people seen in stores without a mask, the more others are encouraged to stop wearing them. It's been going on for so long, normalization has set in and I imagine so many are following along because they don't want to be the first one to make a move. I've been doing this since late 2020, since finding out about the exemption rule only a few weeks after masks were made mandatory.</p>

        <p>You sure love to nag from your high horse while throwing a bunch of ad hominem attacks instead of actually replying to what I say. Stop reading into my posts and making shit up to be angry about, I haven't said or meant anything you keep implying. I'm not telling anyone to get fired or risk anything. There's a way to not wear a mask that someone else told me "everyone knows about" that people must not know about because they act like it's not an option. You're ascribing way too much importance to walking around a store without a mask, which you can't seem to decide if it's a big deal or not because you imply I think I'm so great for doing something so mundane but you can't even hazard attempting it after over a year.</p>
<p>"How about you learn the fine art of acting like an adult and letting people live their lives as they see fit, rather than as YOU see fit."</p>
<p>As if I'm telling anybody how to live. Your first comment to me was "tell us what you do so we can follow your example", which then ignited your passive aggression after I did just that. This entire sub is based on hating people living their lives as they see fit and demanding they resist the rules, ironically. Not everything that isn't ass kissing or a tired meme followed by "/s" is a vitriolic rant, although I can understand why any sarcastic criticism can trigger a Redditor's PTSD.</p>
<p>Done replying to you now, this is a chore.</p>

        <p>"I complied, primarily, so as not to terrify elderly shoppers. And make no mistake they were terrified."  </p>
<p>- How do you know how terrified anybody was if their face is covered up? Even so, what does it matter? This sub boasts that the flu and Covid have similar mortality rates, so they're terrified of nothing, according to that logic. They can wear a mask if they want, but don't let their fear over something you don't even believe in kowtow your behavior. When would that end, when the TV says it's over?   </p>
<p>"defiantly lying"  </p>
<p>- Asthma falls under the criteria for exemption, which I do have. Even if I didn't, I'd gladly make something up. I phoned this official hotline in November and asked if anything counted as an exemption and they said there's nothing that merits not wearing a mask, even though there was government documentation that says otherwise. What a shocker, more lies. People complain about how unfair and illogical the guidelines are and still obey sections that aren't even laws.  </p>
<p>"And yet you've not been more effective than those you criticize."  </p>
<p>- Nice try, but I already told you in another post that me doing it alone won't change anything. I'm not trying to lead a movement and never said I was. Everyone I've talked to IRL won't stop complying despite agreeing with me, so I'm just doing it for myself.<br>
I'm specifically pointing to the thousands of protestors who spend their weekend acting like men of action for the people but can't do the absolute minimum. Even so, how am I less effective? Thousands of people yell into a megaphone and walk around their city for hours before going back to compliance during the week, none of them any more free than before. I stopped wearing a mask, and I continue to be allowed to not wear one. Sounds like I've already accomplished more than they have.</p>

<p>Seriously? Their frightened eyes are not covered up. And body language is a "thing". 🙄</p>
<p>"I'm specifically pointing to the thousands of protestors who spend their weekend acting like men of action for the people but can't do the absolute minimum."</p>
<p>This makes no sense. Protesting is not less than "the absolute minimum". </p>
<p>Not wearing a mask in Walmart does not exactly make you the leader of the people </p>

<p>A legend in your own mind. 🙄</p>

<p>Regardless, we're far past any outbreaks, and the PCR tests used now could practically detect Ebola in most of the population. We're done.</p>

        <p>I was at the london lockdown protest today. I met a lovely woman who protested Iraq back in the 2000s (I was just a child then).
Had lovely time, most chill and varied crowd I've been in in a while.
I'm surprised anyone was arrested. I mean, I wasn't scouting the whole of the march, but the atmosphere was relaxed.</p>
<p>Also: it was hilarious to see how police officers at spots where media photos were most likely to be taken (like near Parliment) where wearing face masks, whilst police hanging around over parts of the march could not care less about face masks.</p>

        <p>Thank you for posting this. Shills have been trying to put faked or altered pictures of the protests going on. Here in the USA the press didn’t cover the huge protests in California. My suggestion to everyone is it is time to surround every major news outlet with these protests. It’s kind of hard for them to report lies when the truth make it hard for them to get to work.</p>
