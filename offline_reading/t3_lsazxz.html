    <strong>The reaction to the UK’s plan to come out of lockdown scares me.</strong>
    <p><p>If you’re not from the UK, we’ve basically announced that we plan to scrap any rules regarding social distancing on June 21st.</p>
<p>In turn, music festivals like Reading and Leeds have announced that they’ll be going ahead this year and advertised ticket sales. The response to them doing that truly scares me. </p>
<p>People in the replies on Twitter seem outright annoyed that other people who are buying tickets dare to try and have a good time with their friends with no restrictions in place, accusing anyone who attends of being murderers and demanding that it doesn’t go ahead. When it gets pointed out that we literally have a vaccine of which rollout is going extremely well, they cry that the vaccine doesn’t stop transmission. </p>
<p>By there logic, even though we have a vaccine we can’t ever go back to normal and they seem completely happy with it. Honestly, my life isn’t perfect but one thing this whole thing has taught me is how sad and pathetic some people’s lives truly are and will continue to be way after lockdown ends.</p></p>

        <p>Those people complaining were basement dwellers all along. It pisses them off that the world will go back to normal and they’ll still be at home taking cat selfies and applying for a fake disability.</p>

        <p>I think there are a lot of people out there who are enjoying watching Netflix in their Pajamas all day while "working from home". I think there are over a million people who have been on furlough for a year now who don't want to go back to work. I bet a lot of those who complain to much are probably some of the biggest rule breakers. Kind of like how male feminists always turn out to be philandering sexual predators or fire brand anti homosexual pastors tend to get caught with meth and a rent boy or making their mistresses get abortions. He who doth protest to much and all. </p>
<p>Like how many talking heads in the MSM have been done for "COVID violations"?</p>

        <p>My office doomer has 2 dui’s, a drinking problem, smokes, and eats like shit, and has a history of “medical issues” that no doctor has been able to diagnose. All of a sudden she’s the office health coordinator and covid gestapo. I know she’s just banging the dog all day long at home, and once we get called back to the office she’s gonna scam her way into a doctors note.</p>
<p>Guaranteed. These types are all the same.</p>

        <p>There are likely bots and agitators seeding these negative reactions as well. They already have another lockdown planned so a hearty public backlash to re-opening will give them social license to impose it. All narratives are steered.</p>

        <p>I was following a “covid update” Facebook group that leaned more towards pro-lockdown, pro-masks etc. I thought it was healthy to at least see what they were discussing to avoid the echo chamber effect. That was until they started posting articles about people booking summer holidays and buying gig tickets for August and were commenting “this should be cancelled!” “No way it goes ahead” “I hope they lose their money lol”. When I challenged them and pointed out that the only reason things would be cancelled is if things have started getting worse again, hence “hoping” for this is literally hoping the plandemic ramps back up they went mental. Started stalking my Facebook page going through my old photos, then piling in with hateful comments, then my comments were deleted and then I was kicked off the group. The one positive to take away is that around 60% of the other comments were also people calling them out and saying “why wouldn’t gigs be back on in August?”. Hopefully the masses begin to wake up the more this shit show goes on</p>

        <p>Hope for the UKers out there that everything will be back to normal by then (or earlier of course).</p>
<p>Keep in mind though that this is just Shush, shush... Go back to sleep and just wait for June 21...</p>
<p>Nobody's going back to normal. The reason is that they planned something really big and I expect the release of a new virus within the couple of weeks. This virus should look natural, but is man-made. (Kill switch on for those who were tested? Crispr, intranasal vaccine?)</p>
<p>I hope I'm wrong though, but they want a new world order, and they won't just waste this crisis.</p>

        <p>Those people are either losers or liars. Either way, things will be fine. People react immensely to FOMO. Once they see others out and about enjoying life they’ll do the same because the truth is almost no one really cares about this virus the way they pretend to</p>
