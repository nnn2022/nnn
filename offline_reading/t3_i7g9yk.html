    <strong>The Future of Feminism after COVID-19</strong>
    <p><p>before the COVID-19 hysteria ensued, i considered the Left an ally and proponent of feminism, and i believed that the Right was an enemy of women. like everything else, the Left's heavy-handed, regressive response to COVID-19 has shaken my faith in the future of feminism in the United States and forced me to re-examine my principles.</p>
<p>to me, it now seems like women must make a choice between being a parent and having a career. until the kids can go back to school in-person and full time, one parent must make themselves available at all times for their children's education. parents cannot work from home and supervise their children; something has got to give. either your job gives or your parenting gives. people have come up with all sorts of wacky arrangements and shifts, but at the end of the day, women are still getting the short end of this stick. we are still picking up the childcare slack and unpaid labor.</p>
<p>for many families in America, you can't just quit your job because your family needs your income. you need to pay the bills, covid or no covid. you need health insurance, you need to pay for retirement, you need to put food on the table, you have to pay off those student loans. what happens if something happens to your partner, and suddenly you're responsible for everything? what happens when you get old and retire, but you have nothing in savings?</p>
<p>what if you went to college or grad school and racked up student loans? what if you just like going to work, if you like having an independent life outside of the home, if you like having an independent identity apart from your kids and partner? what if you like the challenges at work, what if you like your coworkers, what if you like being engaged with the world around you? what if the idea of being a house frau and wine mom makes you want to chuck yourself off a cliff? what if the idea of being trapped in your house with your kids all the time makes you die inside? what if you just want to be your own person, wholly and fully separate from your home? what if you feel like... you'll be less of a person?</p>
<p>and we all know that if you leave the workforce - whether it's by force or by choice - it is so much harder to get back in. when people see an empty space on your resume, when they see those bug gaps in employment - whether it's because of the recession, or you had a baby, or you got sick, or you were taking care of a family member - it is so much harder to get hired. you're competing with people who never took time off, people who are hungry, people who will do everything in their power to get the job. your earning potential is decreased because you took time off from the workforce. you will earn less money over time for the rest of your life, you will be looked down upon, you won't be the most qualified candidate anymore. you'll be on the mommy track forever.</p>
<p>i just don't see men having to make these choices. i'm sure some of them are, i know some men are doing the stay-at-home dad thing, the WFH thing, the daddy daycare, the full-time teacher thing. parents are the real MVPs right now - pour one out for the mommies and daddies.</p>
<p>if we have kids (FWIW, i am married but still kid-free), we are now full-time teachers and housekeepers and short order cooks and nurses and playmates and emotional punching bags and &lt;feel free to insert thankless task here&rt;. my husband has even said he's progressive, he's a feminist, he's an ally... but if we had kids, he wouldn't quit his job to stay home. now he didn't say he'd expect me to do so - no, we'd do the upper middle class thing where we spend money on private school and tutors, and schlep the kiddos to Grandma and Grandpa - but i mean, my god, what the fuck? what are we doing? most families and parents in America don't have those options, and they're absolutely screwed. the parents are screwed and a generation of kids are about to be screwed.</p>
<p>if you don't want to stay home and be your kid's teacher, and you want to go back to work (for any number of reasons), you're a bad mommy who doesn't love their children. you're less of a woman. how dare you bring kids into this world if you don't want to care for them and raise them.  you're lazy. you're selfish if you want to go back to work. you're an idiot if you don't think you can or want to teach them. oh come on, it's easy, right?</p>
<p>if you want to stay home, then you're a bad feminist - you're making us all look bad. you're lazy, you're selfish.</p>
<p>six months ago, women in America had a choice - now, it seems like we don't, and no matter what we do, we're wrong, we're the bad guy, we're mean, we're selfish, we're lazy, we're short sighted. if you don't stay home, you don't love your babies.</p>
<p>blue states and the Democrats have effectively cancelled women's participation in the economy - until the public schools and the daycares are open full time, women can't go back to work. they can't get back in the game, they can't pay their bills. sure, discrimination is illegal in theory - but who in their right mind would hire a woman of childbearing age over a man, when you know at any moment, the powers-that-be could shut it all down, and you lose a valuable worker? you're not going to recruit those  female candidates, you won't put any time or resources into women, you won't develop women as leaders. women will be left behind in the workforce - public, private, military. we will be left behind permanently. we will be shut out.</p>
<p>i am so angry because i feel like the Left and the Democrats want to put women back in the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant. i feel like the Right is now standing up for independent women and feminism. i used to say that feminism is for everyone - men, women, children - we all stand to benefit from feminism, from everyone being truly equal before the law. but my own government won't let women go back to work, they want to see us fail, they want us to be second class citizens again.</p>
<p>women couldn't vote until 1919. we couldn't really work outside of the home until the 1970s, and even then, we became teachers and nurses and secretaries - you know, jobs for nice girls. we were expected to quit our jobs and stay home after we got married. we couldn't have our own bank accounts or credit cards until the 1970s. we wouldn't get legal abortions until 1973. we were treated like children, like pets, like pretty little fragile things until pretty much the dawn of the 21st century. and where are we now?</p>
<p>in five months, we have undone 50 years of progress. my mother worked too hard for me not to be great - she sacrificed her career, she didn't regret it, but she says now that she wishes she had a real choice in the 1980s. she doesn't want me to be forced to make that choice. no woman should have to make that choice.</p>
<p>so, where does feminism go from here?  who is a friend, who is an ally? who is the enemy, who is a foe?</p>
<p>i'm questioning everything i ever believed in and i don't know if feminism has a future.</p></p>

        <p>It seems like there are way more woman in this sub than in general on Reddit for some reason.  Just an observation and I have no theories which is interesting since I normally can use my sosh background to at least toss out some bullshit, haha.</p>

<p>I dunno, maybe it's just normally people don't normally have to explain their situation as people do sometimes here so maybe maybe there are more woman than I realize but it just doesn't come up.</p>

        <p>I think it's also because pro lockdowners are much more aggressive and happy to shout at women, because they're less likely to stand up for themselves. I don't want to wear a mask in public, but I really don't want to get punched over it.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the only actually feminist subs were banned not too long ago. But in short, it seems to me that you just had two epiphanies. One, neither the left nor the right has women’s backs. For the right, women are private property, but for the left we’re public property. Not a nice set of options there. Two, feminism isn’t for everyone; it’s for women. If we try to make everyone happy we won’t accomplish anything. Mainstream, liberal, choice feminism is bullshit but that doesn’t mean staying at home is somehow anti feminist. Or feminist, for that matter. Anyway, I remember how frustrated I was when all this first dawned on me for real so feel free to PM if you wanna vent or just discuss these ideas.</p>

        <p>I didn’t mean to demonize anyone. I believe that you don’t. That sentence just encompasses very succinctly what most women don’t realize about the left. That it’s not any more friendly towards the feminist cause than the right is. But yeah, of course generalizations have to be made to some extent when talking on a large scale.</p>

        <p>I did not mean to cancel you or myself, of course. I have lived in plenty of "far right" places that do, actually, view women as property. In Saudi Arabia, I was told by a number of good friends that women were essentially on par with camels. That said, there are plenty of Western right-isms, let's call them, that very much appreciate the natural differences between men and women, see those differences as spiritual in significance, and would love nothing more than a happy, healthy, society where men and women can use their respective strengths to build beautiful things together.</p>

        <p>I actually do agree with you on the last part. I’d rather strive for let’s say equity between the sexes. Equality is impossible since, as you said, men and women are very different on average. Where we probably disagree on is on which percentage of those differences os due to nature and which to nurture, aka socialization. Anyway, unfortunately mainstream feminism just encourages women to acquire stereotypically masculine roles (both the positive and negative ones). Ideally, I’d like to embrace the positive ones only and shift some of the effort to encourage men to embrace the positive aspects of femininity too (again, always speaking on average, there are no pink and blue brains).</p>

        <p>I absolutely agree but the left has had a hand in destroying women's rights for a while. I don't think that right left ideology is pro woman however... More conservatives I know are more respectful of women and well... at least not obsessed with defining female out of existence. Over the last few years I've decided it's an individual not the ideology. But... It also puts me in a strange position for voting. Anyway I am a woman and anti lockdown and also against masks and compulsory vaccines. I know other women who are liberalish but find themselves friending more conservatives as of late too. Which I've been doing over several years, and this might be totally anecdotal but the conservatives I've met have been better friends lol.

<p>When I took this test, I scored way in the bottom left. Others have told me the countries I would generally do well in with that result would be Nordic countries or New Zealand. Those countries score extremely high in a recent "<a href="https://www.asherfergusson.com/raising-a-family-index/">best countries to raise a family</a>" list. Like government mandated 6+ months of paid maternity leave kind of places, whereas in the US, there is no required paid maternity leave and it's up to the employers to decide whether or not they provide it and for how long.</p>

        <p>yeah i gotta tell ya, after being on involuntary house arrest for 2.5 months, i am never ever taking maternity leave. i'm going to strap that goombah to my back, tell them to suck it up, and go into work. not being at work for that long, without other human contact besides my husband and like, three normal friends, completely cracked me. maternity leave sounds like a scam and akin to solitary confinement with a needy angry tiny human. it sounds like a punishment for having sex. like, when i was a teenager, the chance of getting AIDS was terrifying on top of the chances of getting pregnant. i'm fine getting pregnant now, but maternity leave sounds worse than pregnancy. no please thank you.</p>
<p>if other people want to take it, cool, good luck, have fun, make good choices.</p>
<p>me? no. absolutely not. at this rate, i might not even tell people if i get knocked up. just tell them i'm fat until SURPRISE! i show up with a kid in a papoose. unless i have terrible complications giving birth or i die in a heap, i'm not taking maternity leave. nope. fuck that. nope. lol.</p>
<p>for the record, i have also seen the political compass quiz, but i usually score in the mid-center-upper right quadrant - the classic liberal. maybe there's no place for me in the new world.</p>

        <p>Lolol. I'd rather strap that baby on me and go play as much as I can while I have some time off work. Quarantine with baby does sound pretty horrible, but no one would be making you use your maternity leave as a quarantine with baby 😜</p>
<p>Edit: actually I couldn't purely play for that long. I like to have a balance of work and play so I'd need to find another productive project to work on during maternity leave 😂</p>

        <p>lol alas i am trapped in suburban quasi-lockdown hell, so there is nowhere fun to go or play. also, i hate to say this, but as much as i love babies and want to have a couple, i think they are kinda boring for the first two years or so, and i will need more adult company to keep me from losing my mind. and i mean, more than my mom (local), more than my MIL (from the midwest but would come out the first six months and i love her dearly), more than my idiot fuck trophy bearing friends. and i love my friends, but they became far less interesting after they popped out a kid. a lot of people - men and women - become super boring after they have kids.</p>
<p>babies like to sleep, babies like to eat - i feel like they could do that in my office, no problem. i'm not into breast feeding but i like naps, so we have a lot in common already. as long as they're cool with happy hour, i say, give it a shot? at worst, the kid can take a nice little nap under my desk. i mean i've done that and i'm an adult. it's nice, it's cool, it's quiet. they'll be fine. i'm not hauling them into the field or the factory, ffs, lol.</p>

        <p>Hahaha I don't disagree with a lot of your sentiment. Sorry to hear you are in a boring place. I am based around one of the biggest US cities so there's always something to do, and some renegade art party being planned at some point. Totally makes sense you'd take the work option. I wonder if those Nordic countries would pay me that maternity leave in cash if I didn't take it or only took partial leave 😜</p>

        <p>i don't believe that anything should have been shut down and i don't believe in the New Normal. i don't want women to be confined to the home after they have kids in the post-covid world. it just feels like right now, there is no choice. and since this is the No New Normal forum, i hope maybe other people want to talk about what feminism looks like in the future, and why it's not advocating for women right now.</p>
<p>i don't think the Left hates women but i don't think they are doing us any favors either. i don't think the Right loves us and i'm quite certain some would love to put us in our place.</p>
<p>this discussion is not about "saving lives" - this is simply about what feminism will look like going forward. we can discuss the pros/cons and morality of the lockdowns in another post. i just don't know what feminism will look like on the Left or Right after this.</p>
<p>you can't compare your suffering to someone else's suffering; it's not a competition; it's still suffering. perhaps if we talked to women in other countries they'd say, "yeah that sucks. the famine here sucks too. everything sucks. sorry, girl."</p>
<p>we can save the discussion on civil liberties for another post but yes, i do believe that the lockdowns are an assault on and an affront to our civil liberties. a pandemic doesn't mean that we lose our rights as citizens or that woman as a class of people suddenly become second class citizens. again, that's for another post, because i believe all of us right now are at risk of losing our rights.</p>

        <p>as a conservative feminist I agree with you - we're being forced to stay home, as opposed to it being our choice. I had to put a lot of my personal plans on hold because of these lockdowns. I know so many women who have had to quit their jobs, struggling with that (and these women are still pro-lockdown, it's insane!). We're really setting back feminism, real feminism, where women make our choices whether it be to work or stay home or whatever we choose to do is not allowed.</p>
<p>This is an affront to our civil liberties as human beings, our human rights. Look at all the dead that we will see forthcoming not from the virus with a 0.26% fatality rate but starvation, famine, cancer diagnoses going untreated, heart attacks, stress, suicide, a collapsed economy...</p>

        <p>You dont have kids and you're bitching about having to hypothetically stay home to teach kids? As a man who has to make the choice to change my whole life to keep my kids home, or possibly expose them/us at school, it's kind of a shitty take. Maybe i stopped reading too early. But yeah in my world everyone is in the same shitty boat. Poor women tho</p>
