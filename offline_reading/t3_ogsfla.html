        <p>I was standing in line at the deli counter this past weekend.  Guy next to me had a "NO MASK" shirt on, so I struck up an immediate friendly convo with him.  We talked how great it is not wearing masks now that we're "Vaxxed".  </p>
<p>Older lady in front of me turn and chimes in "But the new variants!  We need those little wrist bands with the fancy codes that you can scan and it says you've been vaccinated." </p>
<p>I said "Why not just have the government pay for free permanent tattoo's on your forearm that shows your vaccination confirmation number? That way you can't ever lose it!" trying to get her to pick up on the sarcasm.  </p>
<p>She seriously looked at me and goes "Oh... Now that's a great idea!"  I looked at the guy, back to her, and he and I both just shook our heads and cut her from the conversation.</p>
<p>Some people LEGIT think that we need to permanently brand people to show vaccination status.</p>

        <p>They love their new normal, there is no bouncing back from where we are. The only reason why I pray this is not the "Mark", my mom lives in assisted living states away and I didn't act in time before she got hers. I don't know how I could have taken care of her, she's a "flight risk", but it hurts.....a lot!</p>

        <p>FYI - to correct your quote of the verse, </p>
<p>"And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark <strong>in</strong> their right hand, or <strong>in</strong> their foreheads:"</p>
<p>What is in your forehead? Your mind. This means the mark is in your brain, your thought process, your ideas, your beliefs. In your hand, means the work that you are doing on behalf of the beast. </p>
<p>In other words, you wholeheartedly believe in the words of the beast and you even do the work of the beast.</p>

        <p>You make a great point s/.</p>
<p>I am not wrong. Satan would deceive no one by running around tattooing peoples' hands and foreheads. It is what is in your MIND that matters. Satan's weapon is his MOUTH. </p>
<p>Revelation 7:3 "Saying, hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of God <strong>IN</strong> their foreheads"</p>
<p>Revelation 9:4 "And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God <strong>IN</strong> their foreheads"</p>
<p>What is the seal of God? The truth of God's word. If you have the knowledge of what is coming, you will not be deceived. You escape the tribulation because you realize what is happening. The entire tribulation is about deception and Satan coming to earth pretending to be God. </p>
<p>Revelation 9:18 By these were a third part of men killed by fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their MOUTHS. 19 For their power is in their MOUTH, and in their tails, for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. </p>
<p>The two witnesses' power also comes from their MOUTH. Revelation 11:5 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Christ even says that he will fight with the sword of his MOUTH. Revelation 2:16 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my MOUTH. </p>
<p>Words come out of your mouth. </p>
<p>2 Thessalonians Chapter 2:8 And then shall that Wicked (one) be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his MOUTH, and shall destroy with the brightest of his coming. 9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders. 10 and with all DECEIVABLNESS of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the LOVE OF THE TRUTH, that they might be saved. 11 and for God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a LIE. 12 that they all might be damned who believed not the TRUTH, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. </p>
<p>Stuff that you believe is IN your forehead and IN your mind. </p>
<p>Unless of course, you are one of those fools who believes that you will be raptured away before the tribulation, which is completely contrary to the bible.</p>
<p>2 Thessalonians 2:1 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him. (2) That ye be not soon shaken in spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us (referring to 1 Thessalonians where many fools get the rapture doctrine), as that day of Christ is at hand (in other words it is not at hand) 3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall NOT come, except there come a falling away first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition. 4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God that is worshipped so that he sitteth in the temple of God shewing himself that he is God.</p>
<p>Revelation 13:4 And they worshipped the dragon (one of Satan's names) which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast.... 5 and there was given unto him a MOUTH speaking great things and blasphemies.... 6 and he opened his MOUTH in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. 8 and ALL that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>Satan and his goons use their MOUTH as a weapon. They speak a flood of lies and deceive the world. Deception happens in your forehead not a mark on the outside of it.</p>

        <p>Yes, if you repent. The number of the beast is 666. Meaning the sixth trump, sixth vial, and sixth seal. Christ returns on the seventh trump, seventh vial, and seventh seal. </p>
<p>The whole world is deceived. Anyone trying to tattoo 666 on you will set off alarm bells for everyone.</p>

        <p>Where is the scripture that says that? There is only one unforgivable sin and it is not receiving the Mark of the Beast.</p>
<p>Also, there are two resurrections. </p>
<p>Revelations 20:2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a THOUSAND years. 3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. </p>
<p>So after the first tribulation, Satan is locked up for 1000 years (the millennium).</p>
<p>4 - And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had NOT worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. 5 BUT the REST of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection 6 - Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years.</p>
<p>Those who prevail in the tribulation reign with Christ as priests, those who do not are still mortal until the end of the 1k years. </p>
<p>7 and when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, 8 and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.</p>
<p>After this you have the second death as described in Revelation 20:14</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So no, those who receive the mark, but do not repent before hand are not yet damned. Instead, they are mortal souls until the end of the 1,000 year period when they are tested again. If they fail that time, they are judged accordingly.</p>

        <p>Revelation 14</p>
<p>9¬†And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
10¬†The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
11¬†And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name</p>
<p>And with your interpretation of the mark, how would that prevent one from buying and selling?</p>

        <p>Right, this is the second death.  Just because it is an earlier chapter doesn't mean your timeline is correct. For example, Chapters 17 and 18 are parenthetical chapters that explain the symbology of earlier chapters.  Chapter 20, which I previously quoted, outlines how the first and second resurrections happen. No one born of woman is sentenced to die until the second death. Not even Satan dies until he is loosed for a short season after the 1,000 year period. God even set's aside 144k who wash their linens in the blood of the Lamb (repentance) and comes out of the great tribulation. </p>
<p>Again</p>
<p>4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, <strong>neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands</strong>; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</p>
<p>This clearly happens after the tribulation</p>
<p>5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</p>
<p>No one outside of the Nephilim has already been put to death at this point. However, the souls of these individuals are mortal.</p>
<p>6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, <strong>but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years</strong>.</p>
<p>Those who overcome the first tribulation are priests of God and of Christ for 1k years. Why would God use priests during this time? To teach those who didn't make it.</p>
<p>Again they have not been sentenced to die yet.</p>
<p>7 And when the thousand years are expired, <strong>Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,</strong></p>
<p>8 And shall go out to <strong>deceive</strong> the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.</p>
<p>10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the <strong>false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</strong></p>
<p>This does not happen until Satan has been loosed after the thousand years to once again deceive. </p>
<p>Now versus 11-15 talk about the great white throne judgment and the second death. This is where 14:9 comes into play. If after the millennium these people still worship Satan after he is loosed a second time, then they are done. Remember it is God's will that all would come to repentance. Not all will, but that is what God wants. He has no desire to kill one of his own creations.</p>

        <p>First of all, I am under no obligation to answer anything for you, so don't make demands of me to do so. You can go fuck off for all I care. Second, I am not beating around the bush. This is 100% relevant to the question. You stated those who receive the mark have no chance at salvation and I am showing you how you are incorrect in this assumption by pointing out what happens after the tribulation. Those who receive the mark have zero chance of taking part in the first resurrection, but they do have a chance at the second resurrection. Every verse above is relevant because it states exactly what happens after the tribulation. 1. Satan is locked up after the tribulation for 1k years 2. those who overcome get to take part in the first resurrection and are Priest of God 3. Satan is loosed for a short period to deceive a final time 4. Satan is thrown into the lake of fire 5. great white throne judgment 6. Second resurrection or death. Not to mention there is only one unforgivable sin and that is to blasphemy the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>Finally, I simply missed your second question. My answer to that would be, who knows? Satan is the head of the system of government in place at that time. I imagine if you are refusing to worship Satan you are refusing to take part in his system and if you refuse to take part in the system you probably have a hard time buying and selling. Doesn't seem all that hard to stop someone from buying and selling in a digital world.</p>
<p>The whole end-times is about deception. Who is going to be deceived by Satan putting marks on peoples' foreheads? The whole world is deceived.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 11:14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light</p>
<p>That word transformed = 3345 in the strong's concordance and means to disguise, change in "appearance", or masquerade. Satan sure will disguise himself as an angel of light.</p>

        <p>That is fine, you are entitled to your belief and I am mine. In the end, this difference in belief doesn't matter much because it happens after the tribulation anyway and it will be too late at that point. Whether they go to hell immediately or miss out on the first resurrection, either way, one is staring at the end of their soul in the face. The most important fact we both agree on and that is to not accept the mark at all.</p>
