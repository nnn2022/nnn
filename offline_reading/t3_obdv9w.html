    <p><p>You doomer clowns, just go on r/covidvaccinated and see for your blind selves. Literally, every other post there is about the harmful side effects of this rushed "vaccine" which people have been experiencing for more than many months now. How fucking stupid you have to be to inject yourself with a rushed "vaccine" for a so called "disease" which has a 99.7% survival rate? </p>
<p>Are you that fucking dumb? Basically, you people's logic is, "We should gamble and take a vaccine who's long term side effects aren't even known, because it will save us from a virus which is already guaranteed to save us 99.7%." This is your logic. And what's your argument to us? If we don't want this what I like to call "slave mark" (in regards to obedience to your master fauci). What's your excuses? "B-b-but you'll spread the virus to other people!" You little fucks are telling Me that when this is the same vaccine you have been proudly fantasizing and injecting in yourselves with, which never even got approved by the FDA! Yes. And yet, I'm the conspiracy theorist? And apparently this vaxx is not even working for the delta variant. LOOOOL. And many of you, being Fully Vaccinated are still double masking. You don't even trust in your vaccines yourselves, yet, you call us names? Oh the irony and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>The vaccines that you are worshipping are causing side affects in people, and you want to know the funny part? The long term affects aren't even fucking known! You guys praise science that they have made a vaccine in less than a year, yet, even FDA still didn't approve this vaccine. And, to add a final nail in the coffin, even Pfizer's CEO still hasn't gotten his fauci ouchie yet. When in fact him being the CEO, he should have gotten it first. You guys lack simple common sense and don't see the signs around you. Yet, we are the villains?</p>
<p>All this that's happening is a joke and an overblown meme virus. It was never about a virus, rather all these mandatory vaccines and again I'll reiterate for a fucking "disease" that has 99.7% survival rate is not justifiable. At all. All these lockdowns, destruction of the economy, people losing jobs and mental sanity being destroyed, has ruined more lives than this "virus" itself. You doomers are just being lab rats for Fauci and the government, and obediently giving away all your rights thinking the government actually gives a fuck about you. They don't. If they did, they wouldn't have destroyed the economy, kids/adults mental sanity in staying locked home all day and fearing each other. Where I live, you can't even buy clothing or a simple thing as a pen anymore as it all comes under "non essential" items. Wtf does a pen have to do with all this? It was never about a virus. It's all about control. Wake up before it's too late doomers.</p>
<p>Economic destruction, skyrocketing inflation rates, more restrictions and control is just on it's way. For grandma to "live" 2 weeks more y'all have ruined your lives and everyone's in your compliance to all this clown fuckery.</p></p>

        <p>If the CEO of Pfizer doesn't take the vaccine himself, that really tells you something. He knows it's experimental and everything, so he's not going to risk it, yet they want us to.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's not worth it for a virus with 99.7% survivability. If we were talking about something like the Bubonic Plague, which was said to only have about 70% survivability, then maybe. But definitely not Covid.</p>
