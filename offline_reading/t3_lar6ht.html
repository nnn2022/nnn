    <strong>New here, please help me understand this! Fed the propaganda and trying to get through the lies.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I surprisingly agree with so much of what is on this subreddit (surprising to me because I was indoctrinated into ultra liberal, PC cults in college that I critically thought myself out of and got bullied for. So fresh to this kind of thought. Don’t judge me)</p>
<p>Serious question because I am curious-</p>
<p>What is the propaganda behind the memes that praise nurses for being slammed with Covid cases and being exhausted from their efforts 
and shaming the protestors that say they shouldn’t be forced to wear masks/need a haircut? Like is this gaslighting? Is it that the lockdowns aren’t correlating with the increased/decreased numbers of hospitalizations?</p></p>

        <p>Good job getting yourself out of the mindtrap!</p>
<p>Idk if it's considered gaslighting but it is purely propaganda. They don't want you to notice the hospitals aren't being overrun. Don't notice the bored nurses doing tiktok dances. The hospitals that were busy, were busy for normal reasons, plus the healthcare industry saw massive layoffs earlier in 2020, which makes the strain on the "busy" ones look worse than it would've been normally.</p>
<p>And yea, lockdowns don't do shit to help stop the spread of disease, especially ones based on a virus that's never been isolated, let alone been proven to cause infectious disease. (the real shocker, no virus has ever been proven to do this either)</p>
<p>&rt;shaming the protestors that say they shouldn’t be forced to wear masks/need a haircut?</p>
<p>Another misdirection. Most protests I observed and participated in where protesting lockdown measures like closed businesses and tryannical, unconstitutional government overreach, but the media trivializes it like we just wanted a haircut and hate granny.</p>

        <p>Do you personally know any nurses or doctors working in the ICU? People that you trust? Best to ask them their experiences and get info from a primary source who you trust.</p>
