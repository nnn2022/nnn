    <strong>The main purpose of "covid vaccination"</strong>
    <p><p>A lot of people seem to think that covid "vaccines" are some kind of satanic plan of slowly killing the population and especially the elderly, getting rid of extra mouths to feed, so to speak. This may be the case in some areas, maybe. But the main purpose of the fascist vaccination is this - capitalist monopolies, which own the governmental apparatus, take your taxes from the treasury and use them to buy a product you don't need. They own the shares in pharmaceutical companies and they just make you buy their product. They take your money and put it in their pockets, saying that it's for your own good! They can't just rob you openly, now can they. They gotta disguise it, hide it behind a noble cause. And if you take an honest look around, you will see that this kind of disguised robbery, carried out by the monopolistic capital, happens all the time.</p>
<p>Now, if anyone again says "I don't think that's the main reason, the main reason is control", I would like to remind you that a) we are biological beings and economics will always come first in human society, because it provides food, shelter, etc, in other words, ensures physical survival. And b) capitalists are in DEEP DEEP sh-t atm, there is a massive economic crisis which began way before the covid scam, I've already talked about it many times. The profits are plummeting, many capitalists are going bankrupt. So in this situation, what would you do in order to save your money? I know what I would do - I would try to find as many new sources of profit as possible. And that's exactly what they're doing. They decided to put the weight of their financial problems onto the working people, the taxpayers, as per usual, this happens during every single economic crisis which is always caused by overproduction.</p></p>
