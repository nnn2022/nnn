    <strong>I’m disappointed the virus isn’t that deadly. [dark]</strong>
    <p><p>It’s ironic. From the very beginning, I couldn’t believe what was happening and still can’t. My misanthropy had always been intense, but after what is happening now, I actually want revenge. I have completely lost my trust in all humans. </p>
<p>I always hated humans for their lack of thought, spinelessness, primitive herd instinct, but I would have never ever believed that people would be this easy, this stupid, this gullible. This dangerous. Tell them to wear a mask, they do it. Tell them to not join groups and go to family gatherings, they do it. Tell them to test and vaccinate themselves or else they will die, all things necessary for a „deadly“ virus, and they all do it. Why do they do it? Because they don’t want to think for themselves or take responsibility. Because that is energy consuming. Brains on a low flame. I have completely lost my trust in others and their judgment. After all of this, after seeing what people do in fear of a deadly virus that isn’t deadly which is why they don’t die, I am disappointed the virus wasn’t that deadly. It’s so ironic, so twisted. They fear dying, do all of this stuff, and just don’t die when, after seeing what they’re capable of, they should have. And even more ironic that I wish I had died from it after seeing all of this. </p>
<p>If anyone reading this could follow my strain of thought in that paragraph, congratulations. You would be the exception. If I am ever reborn somewhere else in the universe, I will remember humans and this planet forever. I want revenge.</p></p>

        <p>I actually agree with you. I used to be the most optimistic, bubbly person but sometimes I wish this virus was <em>truly</em> deadly and wiped us all out. Literally my entire life went down the shitter because the majority refuse to overthrow our tyrannical overlords. What’s the point of having a brain when you don’t even use it? Humanity was a mistake tbh </p>
<p>However your post does sound like a villain’s origin story</p>

        <p>I like to think of it as the beginning of the Age of Enlightenment where not all 7.9 billion people are invited. We can't keep thinking it's our responsibility to save them. That's over. If they want to defund the police, go ahead. Do it. Want to take an experimental shot? Fine. Go ahead.</p>

        <p>Exception?</p>
<p>Fren, I was certain Portland would have stopped those mentally ill kids from burning it down by now. I was certain Americans would be able to see what's on the tv is poison. I even gave society credit, thinking they would educate themselves on what a 99.97% survival rate would be. </p>
<p>I once thought if America went to Hell, I could trust my friends, family and neighbors to fight along side of me.</p>
<p>So there's this big ass piece of property I'm looking at up north.... and I never want to reenter society again. Words can not express how disappointed I am.</p>
<p>You can't harbor revenge. You can only walk away. Reread Atlas Shrugged and find your happy. You'll find your tribe. We're out there.</p>

        <p>I am horrified. I never expected everyone to follow without asking questions. I don't even know one real life person outside of husband who has not been vaxxed or isn't planning on it. They literally watched others get it and get sick and still marched on. I am completely isolated except for my marriage. I don't even feel like talking to people because if my true beliefs were known I'd be rejected anyway. I have focused on hobby and other stuff on Zoom. The few I did try to warn I wasted my time. I just wrote someone with nerve problems from the first dose of the covid vaccine, to rethink the second dose but probably am wasting my time or will get backlash. :(</p>
