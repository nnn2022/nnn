    <strong>I’m not “anti-vaxx” just because I dont want the rona vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>The city that I work in is very left-leaning. I work a service job and interact with clients all day. Typically we get into discussion about coronavirus and how vaccine rollouts are going in the state. Now I’m eligible to get the vaccine because of my second job but I’m not going to get it. When I tell my clients this, they get quiet, give me funny looks or say “oh but you should!” It’s very rare that I speak with someone who is skeptical about the vaccine. Pretty much everyone I talk to is a) excited that people are getting vaccinated and eagerly awaiting their turn, or b) jealous that certain people are getting their jabs first. The vast majority of people around here say they’re terrified of the virus but still go out to do “non-essential” things (like get their nails done, have parties with 20+ people among other things but thats a whole other rant in and of itself...) while totally admonishing people who “won’t follow the rules.”</p>
<p>Anyway I was talking to a client about how my mom and I share the same job so we’re both eligible to get the vaccine but my mom is also not going to get it. And that there are quite a few others in our line of work who don’t want the vaccine because they don’t trust it, it’s experimental, they would still have to wear masks anyway, etc. My client said something along the lines of “oh see we can’t get out of this until a large number of people get vaccinated. Its a shame so many people are anti-vaxxers.” This just annoys me to no end, these doomers could participate in the vaccine trials if they wanted, but instead they want people like us who are first on the governments “vaccine distribution schedule” to be little guinea pigs for them. They know they wouldn’t take it without knowing its safe but they want US to get it even though we don’t know its safe. And if we DON’T get this vaccine, we’re “anti-vaxxers.” Nevermind the fact that I have all of my vaccinations and so does my kid, OR just the fact that there are plenty of reasons why someone wouldn’t want to get vaccinations or just can’t get them and it’s not any of their business! No, those of us who don’t want to be experimented on are terrible terrible “anti-vaxxers” who are making this pandemic go on forever!</p></p>
