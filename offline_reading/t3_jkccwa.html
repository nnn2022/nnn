    <strong>I fu**ing hate those stupid masks</strong>
    <p><p>The other day a good friend of mine was infected with covid and he´s always wearing a mask I haven´t seen him without one since March he doesn´t really go out since then eather. So how did he get it if the masks are supposed to safe us. Well I´m not going to wear one and let them take away my freedom.</p></p>

        <p>They’ll say it’s because “the mask protects others, not yourself”. Take from that what you will but personally to me this is not based in logic whatsoever and is just more of the virtue signaling crap they’re using to increase compliance. </p>
<p>My friend is a contractor. When he wears a mask in an asbestos situation, it’s to protect himself from the asbestos, not to protect the asbestos from him. In fact I find it far more likely that if masks worked (they don’t), they’d protect the wearer. If someone sneezes in a mask, it’s likely virus particles are being projectiled out through the mask all over. The chances of you walking through a bunch of those just floating around and those getting through your own mask are far less, but definitely still a thing. I don’t get where this all started but they aren’t this magical piece of one way fabric like they make them out to be. I also believe masks increase transmission. You sneeze and cough in your mask and then take it off and put it back on repeatedly during the day and touch it and then other things, spreading your germs that are on the mask all over. It’s disgusting. </p>
<p>I like your fire and passion, keep it up. We need more like you in our fight.</p>

        <p>Bingo. My dad had a fitted N95 back when he had to go into situations with pathogens, wasn’t allowed in with anything less. </p>
<p>I wish these people could see what professionals have to do to get a fitted N95, because it’d make them all realize what a joke their cloth and surgical masks and not fitted N95s are (hey even fitted N95s aren’t even 100% effective). They stick their heads in a “hood” and an irritant spray is released-the mask is adjusted until they can no longer taste or smell the aerosol. This is what they wear when an actually threatening respiratory virus is circulating (TB situations), and even sometimes full on biohazard type suits. They also know proper procedures on how to wear these and not cause further contamination. Your run of the mill average Joe with a surgical mask he’s reused 5 times and takes on and off repeatedly is not helping anything, and is likely making things worse.</p>

        <p>Here’s a quote from a book I’m reading regarding the Palomares B-52 crash plutonium decontamination:</p>
<p>“According to the DNA [Defense Nuclear Agency] report, the [surgical masks given to the soliders] masks offered no protection against radiation hazards and served mainly as a placebo—‘a psychological barrier to plutonium inhalation.’”</p>
<p>Sounds kinda familiar.</p>

        <p>Agreed.  I have to wear a mask at one of my jobs (thank God only one) and it does nothing except make me touch my face 10x more than I normally would.  Half the time I’m outside, and more than once I’ve had a bug fly up under my mask.  Totally protects against miniscule ViRuS particles /s.  Let other people wear one if they want to.  I’m not at home trembling in fear just because the TV tells me to, if you’re afraid and you actually think your old piece of tshirt over your face helps you, then you can wear it.  Don’t force your stupidity on me.  I’m so over it.</p>

        <p>The mask he has is probably meant to stop particles from getting in and is not the type of mask normally seen out on the streets. N-95s are normally worn for blocking small particles.</p>
<p>If you have a normal mask which is not made for these purposes, it may block some particles, but not all. If you wore an N-95 everywhere and constantly sanitized, you would probably be very safe. However most people just wear the normal cloth masks that don’t do nearly as good of a job at blocking particles.</p>

        <p>Masks aren't there to protect you from the virus. They're there to protect you against an angry mob.</p>
<p>On a serious note, I don't think people understand that COVID19 isn't that dangerous, restrictions have consequences (mental health, education,  economy, delayed treatments etc.) and are ableist.</p>
<p>Forget the deaf, PTSD, anxiety, claustrophobia, autism, sensory issues, asthmatic and everyone else. Only COVID19 matters! That's what society messages. I qualifies as a medical exempt, so in theory I wouldn't need to wear a mask. I've however found out they protects one from people full of fear. Fear brings the worst out of people. I won't hide my face when the clear mask I've ordered comes. But there may be a delay sadly!</p>

        <p>Anecdote:  Masks were mandated at gyms overnight where I am.  The following day a girl with legit exemption documentation &amp; asthma inhaler was berated and accosted by everyone working out.  So figure out this mentality.  In the spans of less than 24 hours, everyone went from being fine with people being unmasked around them to now believing whoever wasn't wearing one was giving them covid.  The gym is full of regulars who see each other all the time.</p>
<p>This is what these mandates do to people.  They turn  people against each other.  They create this illusion that it's someone or some group of people's fault.</p>

        <p>Yes, the last 7 months have been a fascinating journey into observing human psychology .  Like you said,  the only thing that changed in those 24 hours was the mandate.   Its not like the virus suddenly got more lethal overnight..   Yet it drastically affected the behaviors of people almost instantly.   </p>
<p>My only conclusion is that most humans cannot,  absolutely CANNOT handle another human breaking the rules that have been handed down by an authority.     There is no discussion amongst the group whether the new rules are justified or not, no questioning or criticisms,  after all,, they were just fine prior to the mask mandate...  its just now, THOSE ARE THE RULES!</p>

        <p>I noticed this too. Prior to the mandates, I barely saw anyone wear masks where I live in Ohio. It wasn't until masks and social distancing were mandated that people started treating people like diseased animals for not wearing one or staying apart. But I have found some sane people here, mostly in the rural areas.</p>
<p>It's funny. Only when authority makes a big deal about something, it becomes a big deal to the public, but without authority stepping in and telling people how to think or feel, people have little to no opinion. Aside from critical thinkers of course. Because when I try to show people the ineffectiveness of masks, they still just say "just wear the mask, it's only a minor inconvenience". Logic doesn't matter on the effectiveness of masks. Just wear it. Comply. Don't ask questions.</p>

        <p>I'm surprised that everyone forgot that hiding away doesn't save you from any illness. It seems that people should read the short story by Edgar Allan Poe called The Masque of The Red Death. In the book, the rich hide in their mansions from a plague that is killing everyone. But the plague was still able to get them even though they were sealed inside their houses for weeks. This story reminds me of these lockdowns and people trying to hide away from the "scary virus"! No matter what you do to hide away, the inevitable will always find it's way back to you. I'm sorry for the long read, I just made a connection to the book...</p>

        <p>I believe that was the goal in the beginning, yes. But we're in October now and I think it's ridiculous that we still have any guidelines in place. I think the world is more than ready to open up because we already caused enough damage to the economy, let's try to prevent more damage from occurring.</p>

        <p>Yes that's the key.   People wait to be told what to do and think.  As soon as some sort of authority lays down the law, that's the ultimate truth.   Most truth though lies outside of mainstream authority.</p>
