    <p><p>I can't delete the heckin' thing as that would let the right-wing anti-vaxxers win but I'm really not fond of the idea of spending over two years in total self-isolation, you guys!! I've sent an error report but that was a couple days ago now and the only reply I got was an automated one telling me they've got a huge backlog of requests, queries and troubleshoots to get through before they can attend to me!! I have no food in my pantry and my water's been cut off because I haven't paid the bill in months since furlough was scrapped (Netflix is still up and running though so that's good!!).</p>
<p>I'm barely able to afford DoorDash and I'm honestly considering deleting my OnlyFans account (my boo will be SO ANGRY at me though!!). I'm all chugged-out as it is and I'm so heckin' dehydrated I'm not producing any cum (this started around the time of my second Pfizer jaberoonie though so who knows what's going on down there). I might have to bite the bullet here guys and consider cutting down to only two DoorDash deliveries per day.</p>
<p>I spoke to my therapist over Zoom and he agrees that 1000 days of isolation is probably detrimental to my mental health but that we ARE in the middle of a pandemic so we have to make sacrifices!! He recommended more Zoom sessions to alleviate my mental pain and I agreed, even though that means I'm paying him double what I usually pay him and I really can't afford it right now. But still, mental health is important!!</p></p>
