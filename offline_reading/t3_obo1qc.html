    <strong>Canada is going full propoganda mode</strong>
    <p><p>Any other Canadian nnn members want to talk about how 2 days ago they came out saying that the actual death toll may be 2x whats been reported, then the day after they used this new report to 'shed light" on the severity of covid. I mean they expect us to believe that 52 thousand people have died from covid? All of those deaths just slipped under the table until now? The government was counting suicides as covid deaths, they admitted to this, but 26 thousand random deaths meant nothing until we now? Im so sick of this, its obvious that its just more fear porn, the Canadian government pisses me off so much</p></p>

        <p>Just another fear-mongering tactic by our corrupt Governmnet in an effort to scare people into getting the vaccine.    Sad part is they never mention what underlying health issues these people had.</p>

        <p>yup - I heard that and just shook my head.  I only learned within the last couple months that the public health regions (in Ontario at least) openly admitted in writing last year that anyone who tests positive within 30 days counts as a COVID death - I had always heard that, but I didn't realize they actually admitted it until fairly recently.  I don't understand how they can admit that on one hand, but then say it is actually 2x worse than reported?</p>

        <p>Humans are a species with amnesia, the sad truth is thst the majority of people lack critical thinking skills and the ability to look back and critique what they've been told, they judt blindly accept and follow. Its fucking pathetic. Im starting to feel with the Ontario reopening at the same time as Canada day is just going to he used as a justification for another lockdown in the upcoming weeks the entire pandemic they would put reopenings around the time of holidays to shut down due to high case counts. With everything thats been happening especially around this "delta variant" I can assume that despite vaccinations another lockdown is coming</p>

        <p>Where taught not to be critical thinkers, I was fortunate enough to go to private schools. I can't imagine how bad it is in public schools, simply questioning what your being taught was not acceptable. We had to write essays for social studies, and there was only one conclusion that we were aloud to draw from the material we were writing about. I changed schools for grades 10-12, and I had an amazing social studies teacher, who forced us to think for ourselves. By far my best class and favorite teacher.</p>

        <p>I'm sure some would say the Toronto Sun isn't the most credible source, but they are directly quoting from the public health units who confirm what that they count as a covid death.  I've also seen the actual tweets that each public health unit put out confirming the same thing.</p>

        <p>Great read:  ´ The deliberate fear being spread by our health officials, politicians, and media is a vicious and irresponsible misrepresentation of risk. ‘. </p>
<p>And</p>
<p>´Everything we have witnessed over the past 15 months signals that our scientific institutions and many of those inside them have abandoned all the core principles that make science work. Their behaviour has had far more in common with the slander, smears, shaming, and cancel culture tactics of an out-of-control kindergarten than with the distinguished forebearers of their professions upon whose shoulders they stand. These institutions are rotten to the core. ‘</p>

        <p>I'd suggest disqualifying all positive cases since this pandemic started that was measured with too many intervals on the pcr test. Hell I still wouldn't trust it since you can get postive results from dipping it in coke and juice apparently.</p>
<p>What was even the reason for even considering this? Meanwhile other countries courts decide only a tiny fraction of the deaths where actually covid.</p>

        <p>This is why nobody is really surprised to hear about the government kidnapping natives and putting them in residential schools. "So you're saying the Canadian federal and provincial governments are evil? How shocking."</p>

<p>This country is an absolute shit hole. Everyone is paralyzed by fear. I had a coworker from Mexico who didn't understand why Canadians are so quiet. It never occurred to him that stalinist policies have reduced the average person to saying the bare minimum to get work done and nothing else. We don't talk about our families, our friends, our values, what we like, what we dislike. Everything said in private will eventually be used against you when it is revealed you were talking to some Canadian KGB agent.</p>

        <p>Given the severity of this propaganda in other countries, seems like the USA has been too quiet. What in the hell do those in control have up their sleeves now? Given how my society has only a thread holding its insanity together. One minor thing would result in complete social upheaval.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I believe that was the plan. Get them divided then get their rage to come out. Let the world cull itself by ideological possession alone and complete government reliance. That's what you get when you've raised a generation to not think but accept all as unquestionable fact. So dumb where, if people lost the internet tomorrow, bye bye humans.</p>
<p>Problem is, hell is in the mind that projects onto others. If one suffers the remainder does or has to. Because nobody has answers is no wonder many developed societies have degraded into self-destructive modes. All the while those that pay to have these lies spread while the world melts would be at 40K feet cheering each other on about how they saved the planet from people.</p>
<p>My reply to such sentiments. You're the ones who wanted us dumbed down and destructive. Deflecting societal issues as racial or otherwise to diverge everyones thought from the truth or discovering it. They've all been manipulated. I thank god for the near-death incident. I learned every reason we as humans suffer... It's dead simple to me. I lived it.</p>

        <p>Even the so-called "conservative" provinces (Alberta and Saskatchewan) have pretty well gone off the deep end. At this point I am certain that a majority of our "conservatives" here are just controlled opposition. Including Scott Moe and most of his pathetic Sask Party lackeys. Never voting for them again. In fact, I might not vote again period. Zero faith in the political system anymore, and I barely had any to begin with.  </p>
<p>Best option might be to move to as remote a location as possible and just ride things out. I had been thinking about leaving the country entirely, but that's a long process at the best of times, and these days it's even more so. And on top of that...it's not like anyplace else is really even much better off. Authoritarianism is rampant everywhere. One advantage we do have here in Canada is an abundance of space with a low population.  </p>
<p>As an example, my uncle lives on a ranch which is pretty far removed from "civilization". Nearest town with a decent sized population is around 40 km away. We had a pretty sizeable family gathering over this past Christmas out there, almost 30 people. Total violation of the "household rules" at the time, which were limited to I think five people/immediate family only.  </p>
<p>Nobody bothered us. Nobody around to snitch. Although my cousin (a card-carrying fake woke SJW type) tried to snitch us out after the fact, lol. She called the RCMP about it. Stupid cunt. Anyway, the point is that if you go remote, you'll at least be able to avoid the authorities for the most part. Naturally, this comes with its own set of caveats and challenges. Mostly in the realm of creature comforts and conveniences. But increasingly in remote settings, we're able to access things to a similar degree to those in the big cities.  </p>
<p>Of course, this kind of endeavor isn't exactly cheap, either, so it might not really be a viable option for a lot of folks. A compromise would be to move to a smaller city or town. Most of this horse shit really is concentrated in the larger urban centers. There's some in rural areas as well, but it's largely just "on paper". The authorities simply do not have the resources to be able to cover everywhere. This is the key.</p>
