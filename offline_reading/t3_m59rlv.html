        <p>Why do you want your kids to return to school? You want them to go back to being brainwashed by self entitled teachers? Do you want to send them back to the only place many kids experience violence? If this past year of watching your kids sit in front of zoom classes learning nothing and seeing what teachers are actually teaching your kids hasn't turned you on to how evil public education is then I have to assume that you're either dense or don't like your kid very much.</p>

        <p>Damn brohamski, tell me how you really feel, donâ€™t hold back. I feel like conversating at the moment so Iâ€™ll reply.</p>
<p><em>Why do you want your kids to return to school?</em></p>
<p>Primarily for the socialization tbh. Iâ€™m lucky in that their individual public school is quite amazing and even better than private ones in the area IMO. </p>
<p><em>Do you want them to go back to being brainwashed by self entitled teachers?</em></p>
<p>Gosh, no, of course not. But I refer you to my previous answer. </p>
<p>I donâ€™t doubt that there are self entitled teachers in my childrenâ€™s school but I have yet to encounter them. I also have yet to encounter any serious brainwashing and I am constantly on the lookout. However, I do know that it is coming in later grades and we will not be in the school system for it to be an issue for us. I know this based on the constant political emails that I get from the school board and superintendent. We actually just lost our school superintendent who was rewarded for her political activism by being appointed assistant secretary of education by the new president.</p>
<p><em>Do you want to send them back to the only place many kids experience violence?</em></p>
<p>No. While that may be true for many kids it is just as untrue for just as many, and my children fall under the latter category. In case youâ€™re not catching on I am an involved parent who makes the best choices possible for my children.</p>
<p>My children did not learn nothing this past year sitting in front of zoom. They certainly did not get a good return on their time invested but they did learn. Iâ€™m not advocating for online school and Iâ€™m sure that 90% plus of online students are not better off, my children included. But I will say it again, my childrenâ€™s school, for a public school, Is one of the best schools in the entire state of California. Not the school system itself, but my childrenâ€™s school.</p>
<p>Before I met you, I thought that I was the biggest hater and naysayer of public education. I still think I am quite large of one. I live right by the University of California at San Diego, and I frequent other universities all over the country. I see firsthand how people from Third World shitholes that learned on dirt floors with books are more educated than American children, of whom we as a nation spend more money on per child for education than any other country on earth. We are paying top dollar and getting a shit product in return.</p>
<p>So your assumptions about my situation and the school my children attend were incorrect. Ordinarily I would wrap this up with some sort of insult directed at you based on how you wrapped up your comments towards me. But in your case Iâ€™m going to choose to take the high road and not go for the low hanging fruit that is yourself.</p>

        <p>Online learning has caused me to fail alot of classes and not do well in school ive had a very hard time adjusting to virtual learning but i belive it is needed i would rather be sad and do bad in school than get covid and spread it to one of my older family members and kill them or me die of it and also you can have long term side affects to haveing covid so id like for schools to reopen but only after most if not all of the students have been vaccinated.</p>
