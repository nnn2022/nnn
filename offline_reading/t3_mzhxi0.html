    <strong>Apple doesn't like you to be in FB groups against vaccines, calls them "life-saving"</strong>
    <p><p>The article is about tracking which I don't support (I am on LineageOS myself and use only FOSS) but it reveals Apple's true colors. </p>
<p>"In a speech given a few weeks after the Jan. 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol, Apple CEO Tim Cook pointed out how personal information collected through tracking by Facebook and other social media can sometimes push people toward more misinformation and hate speech as part of the efforts to show more ads.</p>
<p>“What are the consequences of not just tolerating but rewarding content that undermines public trust in life-saving vaccinations?” Cook asked. “What are the consequences of seeing thousands of users join extremist groups and then perpetuating an algorithm that recommends more?”</p>
