    <p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126043553/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19">Johns Hopkins study</a></p>
<p><a href="https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/matt-margolis/2020/11/27/johns-hopkins-study-saying-covid-19-has-relatively-no-effect-on-deaths-in-u-s-deleted-after-publication-n1178930">Reasoning for censorship</a></p>
<p>Just so I have this straight...</p>
<p>The very people that are allegedly keeping track of this “off the charts pandemic” publish data that essentially just says old people die...only to delete their article a day later. </p>
<p>Bottom line is, there won’t be substantially (if any) more deaths in 2020 than any other year. This FLU/virus/COVID/whatever is like a lot of other flus in years past.  Old people - often with co-morbidities - develop pneumonia and die. </p>
<p>There is just too much data/news/information for any one person to swallow, but it is so much worse! When the very corporations and governments we are supposed to trust are all synchronized in their efforts to dupe the entire world about this whole thing, it’s pretty easy to understand why most can’t be bothered to sift any deeper. </p>
<p>I feel I’m getting closer to making sense of this all, but I’m still foggy as to what the end goal of this “pandemic” really is. </p>
<p>Let’s refresh. </p>
<p>Full lockdowns in a large majority of the world in March 2020.</p>
<p>This includes bars, restaurants, clubs, comedy venues, sporting arenas, etc, etc - we know by now how little we have left. </p>
<p>Fauci continues to move the goalposts after lying about mask wearing to public in early stages of “pandemic.”</p>
<p>Focus strays away from number of deaths to the number of cases in the MSM. </p>
<p>Public adoption of mask wearing takes strong hold.</p>
<p>“This is all to save lives.”</p>
<p>Churches, schools, many of these places closed. </p>
<p>Walmart, McDonalds, and Costco open for business. </p>
<p>“Essential workers” really break down to demographics in western societies that serve those enforcing the lockdowns. Man’s gotta eat, woman’s gotta shop.</p>
<p>Corporations have lobbyists.</p>
<p>Mom and pop shops do not.</p>
<p>Elected officials are beholden to their multi-billionaires more than Joe’s corner cafe. </p>
<p>Unelected Public Health officials drive lockdown policies hurting local businesses and community vibrancy.</p>
<p>Churches still closed. </p>
<p>BLM protests with millions of participants not mask wearing or social distancing. Hmmm, that’s just fine. </p>
<p>More cases.</p>
<p>Stricter lockdowns. </p>
<p>Vaccine coming soon! Yay?? Big lol from me.</p>
<p>Reminder. ~99.7% survival amongst general populations without vaccine. </p>
<p>Reminder. Last time I checked anyways - maybe cynical of me to say - but there isn’t a single grandmother in history who hasn’t died at some point or another. </p>
<p>Old people are religious.</p>
<p>Young people aren’t.</p>
<p>Churches still closed. </p>
<p>The very people we are protecting very often believe that when it’s their time, they are at peace with that themselves and if enduring pain/suffering, want it to end. </p>
<p>Vaccine is here! </p>
<p>Wait. </p>
<p>You can still transmit the virus? </p>
<p>You still have to wear a mask? </p>
<p>Social distance? </p>
<p>Yep, yep, yep. Baaaaaaokayyyy.</p>
<p>Don’t come crying to me when you get Bell’s Palsy or worse from a vaccine for a virus that doesn’t kill young people unless they have a co-morbidity. Yes - sorry to say - obesity is a co-morbidity not just for COVID, but for life itself. </p>
<p>Yes, gyms are still closed, so are pubs. So is gathering with people outside your own home or any gathering of any kind.</p>
<p>Zoom meetings and Facebook are great! (Allows the government to monitor for dissent and disagreement with policy)</p>
<p>My takeaway:
Whatever one might consider the “global elite” feel like 2020 is a good year to burn it all down. They’ve won the game of monopoly and they don’t want you to know yet. We’re too dumb, we wouldn’t understand. </p>
<p>But for those who have a chance of putting this all together - don’t get in shape - we want you good and fat. </p>
<p>Don’t congregate with friends, family, community at all. Human touch and contact has become verboten. Gathering with people in person outside your home is too dangerous - clearly - the idea of having productive discussions between people that disagree is a bad idea. Instead, we are living in a clown world where complete strangers scream, engage in violence, video tape you, shame you, all for the purposes of “saving grandma.” It’s about curbing dissenting ideologies that disagree with the public “narrative.” Bars closed for the same reason - in this case so people like me and you can’t discuss AT LENTGH what is going on and try to sort this out. </p>
<p>Religion works for many in the world. Agree or not with the fundamentals, it does bring a sense of community and peace to some people - not me in particular - but I would argue if it’s good for them and they aren’t hurting anyone, why not. The state has gone ahead again to tear apart these last vestiges of hope and community. We simply cannot allow like minded individuals to gather. </p>
<p>BLM protests - no problem. Huh??? I make sense of this because protests are inherently dissenting in nature, but they focussed the narrative away from COVID. Many protests even brought about violence, rioting, and looting. All of this as a means to tear community apart both literally and figuratively. </p>
<p>Mom and pop shops closed. Big box open. We need to consolidate ALL the money. Simple. The only businesses allowed to operate are huge. Hundreds of millions or billions in revenue or forget about it. This part still has me scratching my head a bit. I know the WEF and Klaus Schwab wish for what looks to be a Technocratic, seemingly communist future by means of the Great Reset. </p>
<p>We are getting well into fear mongering campaign round 2.0. Just in time for the rushed - never before done MRNA vaccine - we have another “more contagious strain” of COVID to scare people just in time for Christmas. </p>
<p>I feel like the only means to save certain industries will be for the government to buy them out at massive discounts. Airlines, commercial property, etc - all at the hands of the taxpayer dollar. Since global financial markets are all linked, the very liquidity the government puts into the market can only be swallowed up by the remaining large corporations. Soon automotive will follow. Since fewer people will have the need to travel to an office since they are working from home - or whether they simply can’t afford a car, the government will need to begin socializing vehicles and travel to the public. </p>
<p>We are on a path toward an oil free society - the money at the hands of the oil cartels will simply wither up and go elsewhere - perhaps to the few remaining corporations that make everything that still remains. </p>
<p>So if we wind up living in perpetual fear over a virus that only kills you if it’s your time anyways - I feel we inevitably lose all our freedoms and give all our money to the corporations and lives to our governments. I don’t think grandma would be happy to see us all living in our new communist prison cells we call “home.” Our predecessors all fought wars for our current freedoms and spent decades building up a society we’ve torn down in 9 months. </p>
<p>Let’s wake up and take the world back before it’s completely gone!</p></p>

        <p>I have become more optimistic in the last week that more people are going to start questioning things. I have noticed a lot of comments to the effect of "well of course you can still spread the virus once you're vaccinated. They said it's two shots. Once you get the 2nd shot you are immune and can't spread it. Once people get both shots they won't have to mask anymore."</p>
<p>Which, as we all know is not true. Fauci among others have said you can still transmit it even after both shots. So I think once people realize they have jumped through this last hoop to freedom, only to be told.... "keep wearing your mask" a lot more people are going to start asking questions. It will help once the all cause death numbers for 2020 are released also.</p>

        <p>The problem is that HEALTHY 70 year olds are dying from this virus. My father dying from CoVid-19 was sad but I had realized months beforehand that he was coming to the end.</p>
<p>Mom? No: She was healthier than me and should have, on the merits, laughed at this virus and gone "CoVid-19 GTFO!", living another 15-20 years.</p>
<p>She didn't. Which is why I keep on hammering on "Yes, you had mild symptoms with this virus... a lot of other on the merits healthy people are having extreme symptoms and/or dying/coming close to that!"</p>
<p>The damned virus is so chaotic on whom it decides to kill until you run blood tests to find out "Oh, this person has extremely and exceptionally low levels of Vit. C, Vit. D and Zinc!" that I cannot blame people for being frightened of it.</p>
<p>That said the lockdowns and masking wasn't the proper method of controlling or combatting this virus because it became quite apparent after June that they didn't work and might even be counterproductive.</p>
