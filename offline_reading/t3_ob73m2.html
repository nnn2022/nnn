    <strong>The vaxxed look sicker and sicker to me and bad feelings I have.</strong>
    <p><p>I still feel a grey caste around all the vaccinated. It's like a feeling of doom around them. I was outside in the community and ran into someone I know who was vaccinated. I know some may get pissed here but I am still wearing KN95 masks, the masks are more for the shedded spike proteins as much as any Covid, remember I am disabled, you do you and I do me, I don't care who wears a mask now. </p>
<p>Anyhow, I noticed this person looked sick. I see it on all of them, just this look of unwellness. She had red blotches all over her face and upper arms.  Some of them are looking worse in the skin now then I do with my already diagnosed [pre-Covid] autoimmune disorders that have attacked my skin. It is weird seeing people looking all blotchy now. It is unsettling me.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are getting sick and not talking about it. I am in Zoom groups and notice people just disappearing. The level of depression now is extreme, they know how to beat down populations psychologically and well, I have the depression too but I am still pissed and I see through their BS.</p></p>

        <p>It‚Äôs unfortunate. My loved ones are pressuring me to take it, I may never be able to see them again because I absolutely refuse to be a test subject for some global nazi experiment.</p>

        <p>That sucks with your loved ones. If they don't respect your decision, you are better off never seeing them again. They'd probably turn you over to the authorities and betray you if it was ever made mandatory. I am sure if I was in contact with my abusive family, definite abuse would be coming my way over refusing.</p>

        <p>I'm planning to put together bug out bags, and have it as a rule both cars are gassed up, at least over half at all times. I think the camps are coming soon too. Some people claim this is a redneck county, I hope so, I live in town so around the brainwashed.  The vaxx rate is around 50 percent.</p>

        <p>I wish I knew one person around here who chose the God side. Husband joked last night are you going back to the fundamentalists? I told him all the bible prophecies I studied were coming true. I left the spiritual abuse and bad stuff behind in the evangelical/fundamentalist world and have troubles with some of their beliefs so where I am at is a strange place. Most Christians here got it anyway, even some very "devout" types. Even here the bible warned families would turn against families, etc etc.</p>

        <p>In 2017 my home and car were destroyed by a hurricane.  And then everything else in my life started falling apart like dominoes.  I hit rock bottom thru no fault of my own.  Everyone kept telling me this was part of Gods plan. They had good intentions but that is probably not the best thing to say to someone hurting.  I began wondering if the God I believed in my entire life was even real.  I couldn't feel God, I just saw the evil in the world and felt empty.  I needed to move on and was starting a new job and I finally decided that I wasn't sure if i believed in God or not but i figured if there was a god then something would hopefully help me see it at some point. But i was done praying to someone i wasn't sure if he even existed.  Then i saw the virus, the crazy weather like the hurricane that destroyed my home and it all made sense .</p>

        <p>You went through too much, sorry to hear this. I heard the God's plan people too, if anything they helped push my deconversion along. Why was God's plan then for me to suffer, lose everyone and be disabled young and then be humiliated? Some of those people crowed about their constant blessings. I was very unhappy in Christian circles.</p>
<p>I started wondering too if any of it was real after none of my prayers were answered, we are talking for years.  I also think when I was so fundamentalist and warning people about the new world order, and really intense stuff, I was walking on the edge of a cliff to do this and I slid off. It did take a toll. Actually one of the final straws with my abusive family came over religion, they didn't know what I spent my time doing but they were trying to silence me and forbid me to talk about God or religion. I didn't preach to them or anything like that but they said no talking about God, it was weird.</p>
<p>I don't want to go back to the cage of evangelical/fundamentalist Christianity because a lot of psychological harm and spiritual abuse came to me in that world. Some of my beliefs are still different.  I used to preach as a fundie, most of the churches were fallen away. LOL I'm not sure what to think with all the bible prophecies coming true and being warned not to take the vaxx. Why did God not answer prayers for years and show up now to say "Don't?" I am in shock I did not join my very liberal church in the vaxx parade. </p>
<p>I am glad more makes sense to you know. I certainly am in a different spiritual place than most who have accepted all this. I think of verses like "My sheep hear my voice". I hope your life gets better.</p>

        <p>Thanks for actually understanding me! That bond even thru Reddit has healing abilities lol. But it really is nice to know I'm not the only confused person.  What I find interesting is that the friends of mine who believed there was a NWO and connected it to the bible (some were not even political) but we all figured it out and have been on the same page with the election,  the vaccine,  with god etc. Most of us belong to different Christian churches but we are all Christians.  Thst is the key...the connection with christ. I lost my oilfield related job thanks to Biden in March and today I  got a job offer! Its 10k less base salary (I'm in sales) but it is in a different more stable industry.  I asked God to not give me what I wanted but would be best for me. I feel he delivered. I don't think I will be forced in vaccination at this job.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that. My in laws are dead, and there's one sister whose never visited us in 18 years. I had to leave an abusive family and face facts none of them loved me either. I am glad I went no contact before all of this broke. My family was of the system. I thought they were going to beat me up the day I told them a mild opinion about 9-11. My mother even once defended the NSA to me.</p>

        <p>Its so sad. I'm thankful to still have a few friends not brainwashed and my church is full of people like me. Its refreshing to talk to them in person where there's no judgment and they understand. Lots are going through the same thing as well. Jesus never  let's me down and the Bible strengthens and calms me.</p>

        <p>One reason I deconverted is I never found a decent church, the one here abused me over being poor and husband in gig employment. My first fundamentalist church closed when my old rural town died [economics] we were forced to leave. That pastor I think was sincere, he left the IFB. There's few fundamentalists here and the other IFB I went to was run like a cult. All I saw was judgment. After I deconverted I am in a very liberal church that is far more loving and kind to us, but 95 percent of them are vaxxed. I have told husband they could ban unvaxxed people there, and to be prepared for anything. I hope I am wrong. I also hope I am missing a few silents who have refused the vaxx but just don't know.  This is another loss, no one to understand. If you have people like that around you, you are very fortunate.</p>

        <p>I think there may be more people like you in your new church than you realize, they may be scared to speak out and who can blame them. All we can do is try to show His love to all vaxxed and unvaxxed and remember that the judgment we feel is not God. We are not to judge anyone, only He can do that.  I am extremely blessed to have some like minded peeps around me, I've also have really been enjoying Youversion many different speakers from different streams on the daily devotionals and study plans, I've learned a lot. Abundant blessings to you, may He protect you  guide you and fill you with His peace.</p>

        <p>I've lost friends over this. I am being careful not everyone knows. I realize there's very few people I am close to as a result of this. If not for my husband I would be totally alone. I fear the influence of the his vaxxed best friend too. I had to go no contact from an abusive family some years ago. They were extreme and some even have given me physical threats over drawing boundaries. Don't know what I did to deserve such a hellish life. I sometimes wonder if I died and went to hell already.</p>

She wouldn't let me see my dad last xmas and then they moved several hours away. And my dad got prostate cancer just recently.  He told my brother not to tell me because I was mad at him and told him the vax causes cancer like prostate cancer.  Then 1 month later he was diagnosed with it.</p>

        <p>Glad your mother and brother listened to you.  My family never did and even if I was around still they wouldn't. Sorry to hear your father got cancer right after the vax. I have heard of cancer cases worsening and people getting cancer.</p>

        <p>I've noticed the grey too and the splotchy red skin. There's this girl I used to know that I broke off the friendship with last year but sometimes I still check her social media out of curiosity to see how she's getting on and she looked normal before the shot and after it she did have this sick pallor about her and was flushed and pale at the same time. Her skin looks terrible and it's like the light went out in her eyes. Her behavior also became more erratic. She never was the most stable person but far less after the vax.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's about right. She went from being an articulate woman to sounding as if someone had knocked her upside the head and she'd lost IQ points. I know what you mean too about the light going off in their eyes and I've seen reports of energy workers sensing that the soul had been ejected from the body although the cord hadn't been cut so it's as if they're living in a constant dream state where they're very susceptible to programming.</p>

        <p>I feel like the vaxxed around me have lost IQ points. I was part of Zoom groups with very intellectual people, some have been knocked down a few notches. I don't think I am imagining it either. Some of course could be depression from the world turning to shit but it seems beyond that. Yeah the light is off in their eyes. That is the best way to describe it, and it's not the dimmed light of other bad illnesses, etc, it's like it's gone.</p>
<p>There's one woman I see from time to time, I think she didn't get the vaxx [or maybe she was a saline control or someone screwed up] because she still has light in her eyes and spirit, she could be keeping her mouth shut. </p>
<p>I think the energy workers are right that people have been separated from God/Source, if the bible prophecy is right. I cannot talk about this of course in front of all the vaxxed people. Treat others with compassion but I have cried and cried when finding out some people have gotten it.</p>

        <p>I believe some vaccinations worked like tetanus shots and were decent but believe there are many harmful meds out there. Antidepressants while needed for some are handed out like candy, and do it. However this seems worse than any med I've ever seen. The people are different to me.</p>

        <p>I agree, I've noticed exactly the same thing. Also, unfortunately due to the nature of my job, I have to spend a lot of time around different people and in their houses. I've noticed that I feel weird, have some weird symptoms such as headaches, confusion and memory issues, since being around them constantly. It's clear to me as I was away for 8 months out of the UK, and I have only noticed this upon returning to work and being around these vaccinated people. Idk what to do but it is taking a toll on me and I am a very healthy and fit person, I workout and keep my diet up to a high standard.</p>

        <p>I read your comment and I have been experiencing brain fog big time this year. My husband was in the Pfizer trial (I know, it SUCKS) and I‚Äôm wondering if being around him is causing it. Tried to think of other reasons but nothing has changed beyond of course being aware of everything and depressed etc like you all are. It‚Äôs disconcerting to say the least.</p>

        <p>It could possibly be that, especially if you are being intimate with him, you would have a lot more exposure to whatever it is in the vaccine that can shed and be passed on. Do you workout? Working out, getting into the fresh air and sweating hard are the only things that got rid of the brain fog for me but I have to pretty much do it everyday or it comes back.</p>

        <p>Very. I don't know how exactly I am supposed to protect myself from it as I can't wear a mask at work all day and wearing a mask isn't good for you either and who knows if they would even work for this. I've just been keeping my immune system as strong as possible with exercise, diet, supplements etc but I don't think it's enough. After spending 8 hours a few times a week with a fully vaccinated household, I ended up having a headache and serious brain fog for the next 2 days. The only thing that helped was doing a serious workout and getting outdoors. Maybe sweating it out is a solution, like sauna after a gym session?</p>

        <p>I find myself worried about this. Now we have two competing theories that the vaxx are full of graphene and nanonbots or are mRNA spike protein hell factories, in side I am thinking why not both? I don't want infected with either. I can't keep living this isolated for the sake of my mental health, I would already be visiting unvaxxed people if I knew any here. My contact with people has been minimal, like picking up stuff, seeing them outside at my gardening spot and in stores. There's too many people reporting illness with contact with the unvaxxed. I do feel like I live in hell. I am seriously chronically disabled and what may be nothing to a normal person could easily kill me. I take vitamins and am cooking all the time, growing vegetables/partial vegetarian diet, exercising on a walker [damn I miss the gym but it's masked city in there or spike protein/land now] to stay alive. I hope sweating it out helps. My intuition is even saying stay away from them and that's awful on a psychological level. And of course I question how much of that is the programming, fear and BS. We don't even have enough facts and are lied to all the time. At least if there was war we could talk to and be around other people. Of course some believe that's the next step nuking us all. {sorry for the dark thoughts}</p>

        <p>Your not the only one reporting "catching" symptoms. I've read a few stories now. One where an unvaccinated child sat between vaccinated grandparents and rash began to develop all over the child.</p>
<p>Remember when the CDC jokingly warned about zombies... wonder what happens if bitten by a vaccinated person? I think I'd worry less if a junkie prostitute bit me as long as they weren't vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Yes that has to be hard to see your Mom looking sad and fragile and seeing the sparkle leave your brother. :( I feel like I can't describe it beyond words. Husband's best friend is sick all the time with serious heart problems. He looks horrible in pictures like his spark is gone. I feel like I am losing more people. I didn't have that many people to lose. He didn't listen to anything I had to say. I was new to my research and being warned, they moved so fast to jump on the vaxx train, and I barely knew anything to warn him off. Even gave him a pro-vaxx website but I said this guy's arguments don't add up. I think he's a pharm lackey.</p>

        <p>This makes me wonder if some people get placebos, because both my best friends are exactly the same post-vax. So is my one conservative coworker that got it. On the other hand, many other vaxxed people I‚Äôve seen do look sickly or just out of it in general. One coworker has had full-body nerve pain ever since her shot and she looks pretty bad. I‚Äôm thinking it could be random who gets the full shot or just maybe a saline one. And some get stronger doses than others. After all, it‚Äôs still phase 3 of the trial.</p>

        <p>Yeah my boss has had both shots and I was with him the other day and he looked fucked like his eyes were tired almost sad looking 
I said man you looked fucked 
He said I feel tired all the time these days 
Also my elderly mum she‚Äôs 89 but always upbeat etc 
She shakes a lot since the vax and has also been put in anti depressants 
Mum would never had needed anti depressant meds ever she was a jolly old person 
But now she also looks really tired and shaky 
It‚Äôs very strange and can‚Äôt just be coincidence</p>

        <p>Shedding isn't self-replicating (right?) </p>
<p>This is a scary thought that keeps me from thinking about fraternizing with treated individuals.  Many of the above examples seem anecdotal at best. Still, I've read a lot about it and seen the mechanism discussed.  I'm still not sure if this is paranoia.  Still, I think I have to be honest about the possibility, and continue to keep eyes open about potential complications.</p>

        <p>I mean if you're so desperate to block out spike proteins, your best bet would be a Hazmat suit, like the kind they use for radioactive waste disposal. Otherwise, strengthening your immune system and just moving to an area with low vaxx uptake rates should do the trick.</p>

        <p>They are shedding the spike protein, but you can take comfort in the fact that the protein will not be produced inside of you even if you do come into contact with it. I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about shedding. Just my opinion</p>
