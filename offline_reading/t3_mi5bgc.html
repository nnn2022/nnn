    <strong>Twilight Zone (must see episode)</strong>
    <p><p>I just watched "Escape Clause," season 1, episode 6 of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, on Netflix, and I was struck by how eerily similar the episode was to the current New Abnormal.</p>
<p>In short, the episode is about a hypochondriac. A man of perfect health who acts as though he is sick, because he is afraid of dying. He sells his soul to the Devil himself in exchange for guaranteed health, in the form of immortality. At first he loves it, but (spoiler alert) he soon winds up a suicidal prisoner as a direct result of this devil's bargain.</p>
<p>To me, this is a perfect metaphor for the proposed vaccine passport solution to the Covid "threat." It probably sounds like a no-brainer to your average normaloid: take the so-called "vaccine(s)" and you'll never have to worry about the big bad coronavirus again. But fast forward twenty years, and everybody is living in a totalitarian police state -- a prison planet -- and we all want to die.</p>
<p>Definitely check out the episode if you haven't already seen it. It's a perfect parable for the present times, as the powers-that-should-not-be hasten to finalize this devil's bargain with the general public. Show it to your normaloid loved ones, because it might just red pill them, if they can make the simple connection our own situation and the Twilight Zone.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p></p>
