        <p>A Harvard communist leaning professor criticizing capitalism... I'm shocked!</p>
<p>Definition of capitalism: an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state. Capitalism is a free market mechanism where government does not control or have a stake in the economic function of society.</p>
<p>She is right in the sense of big tech running rampant and being able to get away with it due to lobbying, but adding the word capitalism to the equation to throw a jab at it cause she's pro-communism is bullshit. It's big tech surveillance, not surveillance capitalism, wtf does free markets have to do with surveillance ?</p>
<p>We should remove voting and free markets, let big daddy government treat us like Australians locked in our houses and have them deliver us food, then vaccine us and track us on our phones while waiting for our Universal Basic Income deposit in a cashless society, that's a better looking future then the evil boogieman capitalist society who can vote and have some form of civil rights. Communism increases surveillance 10x then a free society, look at China!</p>
<p>Name me one society in human history, just one, where socialism/communism delivered growth and prosperity and ended up benefiting the society it controlled ? Socialism by nature is oppression central, those who get in power fight tooth and nail to stay in power</p>
<p>Communism + AI is the death of human civilization... Witches like Zuboff are pushing for that clown shit, even the video starts out with him saying she's the karl marx of our time. </p>
<p>This video is an embarrassment to this sub</p>

        <p>You know I’m not for big government Nor am I advocating communism but I do know how to extract nuance from sources. </p>
<p>I posted this video to highlight just how rampant the surveillance is in the modern era. I don’t care for the political leanings but I think it’s insane how intrusive it has all become.</p>

        <p>You co signed a known marxist... That's a slippery slope broski, I'm sure your intentions weren't evil but it's scary people don't understand that the push to destroy capitalism is to enslave us.</p>
<p>The reason why the " new normal " hoax was enacted is to make way for global socialism/communism... The worst thing ever conceived is communism.</p>
<p>Creator of Davos and WEF writing an article, June 2020...  <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/</a> </p>
<p>To achieve a better outcome, the world must act jointly and swiftly to revamp all aspects of our societies and economies, from education to social contracts and working conditions. Every country, from the United States to China, must participate, and every industry, from oil and gas to tech, must be transformed. In short, we need a “Great Reset” of capitalism. </p>
<p>The clown and his crew are pushing for " stake holder " capitalism, which is communism in fancy wordplay, they want governments to be able to acquire stake in private companies and the global economy. Investing in " green " through government created companies is the first step, you see where this is going ?</p>

        <p>I never said I support her views. I’m merely pointing out the surveillance state of affairs and said it was relevant. I find the part about how big tech tracks your information terrifying. Just because I repost something doesn’t mean I support it? So when I repost all those doomer articles on r/lockdownskepticism I suddenly am a doomer myself?</p>
<p>I very much am aware of the global reset that is underway and in no way think that any political system can really save us. I also have nothing against capitalism itself, but rather the rampant cronyism which we actually have. If they actually let free markets be free and let market forces dictate what happens, things would be a lot better. However, corruption and lobbying have pretty much put an end to that in most countries.</p>
<p>And yes, I follow what the world economic forum spew out along with the UN, IMF and World Bank which are globalist fronts for achieving their objective of a single new world order.</p>
