        <p>Few actually believe COVID is fake, it’s that the response isn’t necessarily warranted. Some people believe that the virus is being used as an opportunity to usher in the great reset, also as an excuse to possibly force an experimental mRNA therapy on the public.</p>

        <p>Like any conspiracy theory,  it's just a theory. If there was clear evidence, the public would have recognized that it is fake.</p>
<p>There are many things which mean a little too much profit for rich people. The global elites are the winners again and it seems like covid is the best thing that could have happened to them. </p>
<p>As a result, some people go: "Coincidence? I don't think so!"</p>
<p>That's really all there is to it. If I'm wrong, please someone enlighten me.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say you are wrong it just depends on the context...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You can't deny that all these mandates/bylaws and lockdowns putting a stranglehold on private businesses for the Health of the people is nonsensical I live in Ontario and I can walk into a big grocery store but god forbid I want to get my Hair cut!!!</p>
<p>Regarding the term "conspiracy theory" This was used by the Us government to describe people that saw aliens back in the day before they knew the public would not freak out about these claims they actively used that term to make people feel better about them and brush it off now You can believe in aliens or not I don't really care but that word has inherent bias..</p>
<p>If you disagree with the way these mandates and bylaws have been enforced you are not a conspiracy theorist that would make these ex opp officers conspiracy theorists I guess</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PoliceOnGuard">https://twitter.com/PoliceOnGuard</a></p>
<p>Because of a police officer who saw the video of the kid being arrested for playing ice hockey outside and the officer said he will no longer defend the mandates anymore, but instead the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Canadian Constitution):</p>
<p>"Citizens of Ontario, Ontario’s Chiefs of Police, Police Associations, Premier of Ontario, Ministry of the Attorney General, Ministry of the Solicitor General, Municipal Politicians, Public Health Officials</p>
<p>21st December 2020</p>
<p>I am a Police Officer and know many other officers that support the following message.</p>
<p>After the unfortunate events in Calgary, the time for action is now. I have serious concerns over Premier Ford’s decision to expand further restrictions that put law enforcement officers in an untenable situation that must be avoided.</p>
<p>For 10 months public officials and bureaucrats have been operating with arbitrary emergency powers that often violate the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Everyday Premier Ford, Mayor Tory, and politically appointed bureaucrats are on television, radio, and in the newspapers, calling on Ontarians to slowly allow all civil liberties to be taken away.</p>
<p>What I have seldom seen is any comment by those in positions of Law Enforcement and the Judicial System addressing the lawfulness of these measures, or on the grave consequences, they create.</p>
<p>I am calling on the following stakeholders to immediately meet independently from Politicians and Bureaucrats: The Ontario Chiefs of Police, Police Associations, members of the Ministry of the Attorney General including Crown Attorneys, Judges, Justices of the Peace, and Constitutional lawyers.</p>
<p>Please collaborate and deliver clear and concise direction to the men and women in Law Enforcement. Until this happens, a moratorium needs to be declared on the enforcement of public health orders by peace officers. 10 months has been far too long for this not to have happened.</p>
<p>Are police officers supposed to uphold the Charter which they have taken an oath to protect? Or do Municipal By-Laws now supersede the Constitution?</p>
<p>At a time when the public trust in police has nearly eroded beyond repair, this is of paramount importance. The citizens of Ontario deserve transparency from the officials they have elected, as well as from the police that is sworn to serve and protect. This is not an unreasonable request.</p>
<p>What happened in Calgary cannot happen again. Never in my life did I think I would see police officers threatening to taser and arrest kids playing pond hockey.</p>
<p>Signed Police on Guard for Thee Will you stand?"</p>

        <p>Like I said, what you provided is no evidence. It might be an argument or a reason to believe that something is wrong but you cannot tell for sure. It remains a theory until it is proven.</p>

        <p>Thanks for taking the time to post your opinion
Although one thing I would say is that you didn't really provide any credible information on how its a conspiracy.
I was asking for solid info and avoiding personal opinions.</p>

        <p>I didn't comment on why you should believe that it's fake, but on why people believe it's fake. </p>
<p>If you <strong>believe</strong> something, it is never possible to back it up with evidence, because then you would <strong>know</strong> that it's true and would have no need to <strong>believe</strong>.</p>
<p>Truth is, nobody knows that it is fake, because there is no evidence. You can easily look up sources which show who has made which kind of profit and choose if you want to believe/suspect that there is something wrong with the story or not.</p>
<p>Well, what I am saying is: you won't be provided with a leaked receipe to create the virus in a laboratory or any master plan to let it loose. Therefore, asking for it has no point.</p>
