        <p>Getting shitfaced and doing shots is probably more of a health risk than covid will ever be. I think you are referring to the alcohol aspect of it, right? Not the virus thing... You say that he / she will "get it" soon because he / she will become an alcoholic, no? Not because of the virus thing... not because of the virus, no? I'm asking an honest question.</p>

        <p>According to Covid deniers, my brother died of a heart attack. His heart stopped because of a drop in blood pressure. His blood pressure dropped because he was massively bleeding out due to an anti-clotting agent that the doctors gave him because the virus was clotting much of his blood. Covid didn't kill him, his weak heart and hemorrhaging veins did!</p>
<p>So, yeah, in the same line of reasoning a man who is shot and dies, did not die of being shot. He dies because his heart stops as a result of a drop in his blood pressure because too much of his blood leaked out through a hole in his chest. Guns don't kill people, blood loss does.</p>
<p>According to Covid deniers a man ran over by a bus does not die because he of the bus drove over him. He died because fragments of his skull were shoved through his brain. Being run over by a bus isn't deadly. Having a soft brain is!</p>
<p>According to them no one dies of Covid, not even them.</p>

        <p>Nice logic there, buddy. I'm sorry you lost your brother but ask him if he would want 7.8 billion people locked up to prevent something similar and he would probably say no. Was it preventable? The jury's still out on that. If it was, whose fault was it that he got the virus? Could HE have done something different to not get the virus? Maybe he couldn't have. Could WE do something different to not put ourselves at risk? Maybe we could, but that would mean losing our freedom, our livelihood and our mental sanity. Is it worth it? I think it isn't, just because of all the people that are currently suffering (and dying) BECAUSE of the irrational, preventive measures which are being forced upon us.</p>
<p>Maybe if the decision makers would have painted the whole situation in a reasonable manner, maybe if the media would have presented the facts instead of cherry picking panic inducing news, people would be more willing to listen to the advice. But it's their own fault people are getting frustrated with all of it and the media and the governments are the only ones to blame. Blood is on their hands. Both of people dying due to covid as well as the blood of people dying due to mental health issues induced by abusive, freedom stripping, livelihood destroying rules.</p>

        <p>So basically your argument is small groups of senior citizens / older adults are getting sick from covid therefor every citizen should give up their businesses, in person education among other aspects of daily life and keep “Locking down” until god knows when..... or until there is a vaccine which will be forced.</p>
<p>Seems logical</p>

        <p>Not following the proper medical guidelines increases the chance of Covid19 being transferred, which increases the chances of people dying from it. So yes, I would say you're being selfish (moreso ignorant) for not doing the bare minimum to help your fellow people out.</p>

        <p>We’ll have to agree to disagree then. You are free to stay home and wear a mask everywhere if you’re that worried about the virus. But i won’t be shamed or forced into complying with draconian unconstitutional measures any longer.  This stuff is never going to end unless people start saying no. I feel it is my duty to follow my conscience and my rationality which tells me to resist. Now comes the part where people usually get mad and start hurling insults at me. But i will ask you kindly to refrain from that.</p>

        <p>When discussing this with people who share your beliefs it's hard to find any rationality. Being a part of any society means losing some of your rights in return for benefits and security. It's why you and I can't just go out and rob the first person we see. It's also why in most places you can't walk outside completely nude. You act as if a mask is incredibly constricting too. </p>
<p>Y'all don't seem to understand the severity of a pandemic. It is an international security risk where hundreds of thousands of people have died already - with many more to follow. In the US alone, we could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives if we all just wore a mask and followed the Covid guidelines. To deny that is to be selfish and immature.</p>

https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/84900</p>
<p>And here is research from the CDC.</p>
<p>"Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids. There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."
https://archive.is/y22jF</p>
<p>"More research on cloth masks is needed to inform their use as an alternative to surgical masks/respirators in the event of shortage or high-demand situations. To our knowledge, only 1 randomized controlled trial has been conducted to examine the efficacy of cloth masks in healthcare settings, and the results do not favor use of cloth masks."

<p>WHO does not recommend masks
"There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there's some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly," Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said at a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday.

<p>Mask and infection trends across Europe, etc.
http://archive.today/4SGYt</p>
<p>New England Journal of Medicine, 2nd paragraph 
"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</p>
<p>http://archive.is/CfQBO</p>
<p>BMJ
The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks.

http://archive.today/rib2o</p>
<p>University of Minnesota CIDRAP
"We do not recommend requiring the general public who do not have symptoms of COVID-19-like illness to routinely wear cloth or surgical masks because:
There is no scientific evidence they are effective in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
Their use may result in those wearing the masks to relax other distancing efforts because they have a sense of protection
We need to preserve the supply of surgical masks for at-risk healthcare workers.
Sweeping mask recommendations—as many have proposed—will not reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as evidenced by the widespread practice of wearing such masks in Hubei province, China, before and during its mass COVID-19 transmission experience earlier this year. Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE."

<p>“That’s how we ended up with 134 suspect cases,” Dr. Kirkland said.

<p>I see that anyone 50+ years old are above the overall average. Are you saying even though people 65+ years old being hospitalized at 2-4x the average rate, everything is still normal? At what number will hospitals get overwhelmed?</p>
<p>To prevent this from being a disingenuous discussion, I admit the overall average is a lot smaller than I thought.  </p>
<p>&rt;Sweden, who is on track to have no  excess deaths, and may even end up with fewer deaths then the past  decade, despite a 10% population growth?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/525353/sweden-number-of-deaths/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/525353/sweden-number-of-deaths/</a></p>
<p>You'll have a more direct view of their COVID deaths here; it's <br>
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105753/cumulative-coronavirus-deaths-in-sweden/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105753/cumulative-coronavirus-deaths-in-sweden/</a>. Deaths nearly flatlined at 5000 but seem to barely be increasing again.</p>
<p>The graph you linked is too broad - there's so many things that contribute to overall population of death. It's not safe to conclude everything's 'normal' just because overall death population for one country is the same.</p>
<p>What's even more interesting is Sweden is an outlier in reporting deaths: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-sweden-death-reporting">https://ourworldindata.org/covid-sweden-death-reporting</a>. In summary, they process death records differently - so recent death counts aren't reliable/underestimated. There's up to 10+ days of delay in reporting deaths. Ourworldindata is the same org that published the graph you mentioned <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ewz5nfq">https://imgur.com/a/ewz5nfq</a>.  </p>

<p>Do you know their ranking pre-covid? It doesn't mean much to be #20 without knowing if they were previously #1 or #100. While trying to answer that I found out: apparently not locking down comes at a cost even with Sweden. "Sweden’s per capita death rate was 35 per 100,000 as of May 15." (Newsroom.uvahealth) And as of Oct 13, mortality rate is 58 per 100,000 (Time).</p>

<p>&rt;Evidence that masks are useless?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation,  living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside  work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p>"<em>Our target population was community-living adults"</em> in Vermont. Their results in no way represents the rest of the population. But whatever, we can still interpret their results. </p>
<ol>
<li>Table 1 (association) - "There were no statistically significant differences between those who tested positive and those who did not in average age, gender, number of reported symptoms, work exposure, urbanity, living environment or mask wearing outside work. "</li>
<li>Table 2 (regression) - They didn't even include work exposure, urbanity, or mask wearing in this analysis, because they "found no other covariates to be statistically significant in our models." AKA they weren't significant enough to be analyzed regression-ly.</li>
<li>Table 3 (negative binomial) - This probably supports your case the most: "interestingly, results showed that workers who wear masks outside of work also saw more adults than those who did not wear a mask outside of work" --&rt; basically "I'm safe with a mask, lemme talk to my coworkers!" vs "I'm not wearing a mask, lemme avoid people" And there's only 49 observations for neg. binomial, bitch please.</li>
</ol>
<p>They also found that "<em>approximately 1 out of every 100 individuals infected with COVID-19 in the county needed inpatient care.</em> " which is interesting. But all points here are moot because this study isn't peer-reviewed yet.  </p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a> </p>
<p>Here's their opening statement under Face Masks: "In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks " They concluded this from:</p>
<ul>
<li>analyzing influenza infections among pilgrims from Australia during the Hajj pilgrimage</li>
<li>analyzing influenza infections among uni students in a dorm for 5 months</li>
<li>a third study that has potential: "Cluster randomised controlled trial to examine medical mask use as source control for people with respiratory illness"</li>
<li>But it concluded "The study indicates a potential benefit of medical masks for source control, but is limited by small sample size and low secondary attack rates. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy of medical masks as  source control."</li>

&rt; Evidence that masks make things worse? See above... </p>
<p>Yes! We agree on something! Most of the 'masks' people wear are not effective. When you overwear them, when it's wet, when it's a thin fabric - the virus (which lives in droplets) basically eases through.</p>
<p>Would I argue that if I sneezed while wearing a mask (no matter how shit it is), the contamination area is smaller? No. Would I argue to wear the same damn mask for 3 days straight? No. But I'll still wear it, just in case I sneeze.</p>

        <p>Yes, the elderly are above the average. A you'd suspect from a virus that's attacking the elderly far more severely. I cannot tell you why the average is so low as a result, likely due to the elderly trying their best to stay home and stay safe. I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here.</p>
<p>You missed the point. Take a step back for a minute. If a country has an average death rate during a global pandemic, what does that tell you? WuFlu deaths don't matter. It doesn't matter how they're reported. It doesn't matter how many they have reported. If you look at a country's total deaths from a year with a pandemic, and compare it to a year that didn't have a pandemic, with little to no difference in deaths, what does that say?</p>
<p>No one is saying the virus doesn't exist. My point here is that the virus is, most likely, only killing those who would have died this year anyhow. With a high average death rate, and an average of 2.6 comorbidities for 94% of deaths, this isn't at all surprising. We won't know for sure until December, however it looks like Sweden didn't have excess deaths.</p>
<p>Excess deaths typically indicate bad years for humans. Most pandemics have large amounts of excess deaths. Wars, obviously, have excess deaths. However if there's no excess deaths in Sweden for 2020, this implies the no lockdown lifestyle is far safer than anyone would have thought. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what point you're trying to make about Sweden's deaths. But you missed my point, so that's why I ignored more or less whatever you put.</p>
<p>The rankings on that list, if you looked, are WuFlu only deaths. Not overall deaths. </p>
<p>statista.com/statistics/1104709/<strong>coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/</strong></p>
<p>So, again your point is misplaced.</p>
<p>Cases don't matter to me. However many people don't share my belief. If you think they matter, then the source works in you. If you don't think they matter, you're likely in this camp anyhow.</p>
<p>Morso, the biggest point you could make is that Sweden is equal to lockdown countries. However long term they'll likely come out ahead due to immunity build up from before. However being equal with one side violating human rights, and the other doing nothing, is a strong statement.</p>
<p>&rt;basically "I'm safe with a mask, lemme talk to my coworkers!" vs "I'm not wearing a mask, lemme avoid people"</p>
<p>This is a huge point in trying to make. People are acting like masks are perfect protection. They're not. You can see this in any study. Masks are useless and depending on them causes issues. The average person can't go the speed limit and use signal lights. You're not going to get them to follow proper mask protocol.</p>
<p>Unless there's a long term, many month study, instead of the 2-3 week follow up, I don't take "long term" effects as a valid concern.</p>
<p>The study wasn't conclusive, but they still didn't find an effect on mask useage.</p>
<p>Mask studies are useless. It's done in a sterile lab with a new fresh mask. On top of that.</p>
<p>&rt;Multi-layer cloth masks can both block up to 50-70% of these fine droplets and particles</p>
<p>&rt;basically "I'm safe with a mask, lemme talk to my coworkers!" vs "I'm not wearing a mask, lemme avoid people"</p>
<p>This is the issue that causes</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="http://fortfairfieldjournal.com/ffj/2020/11042001a.html">The recent rise in COVID-19 cases in Maine could be linked to the prolonged use of face masks by the general public. 
</a></p>
<p>On top of that, the CDC uses 3ply cloth masks as their standard cloth mask. The standard is 2ply, and 1 ply is still exceedingly common. Morso, a mask gets worn out. Especially now that it's winter. A lot of people leave them in the car "so they don't forget". What do you think will happen when a moist/wet mask is left in a car overnight when it's freezing out? Water turning to ice expands. It'll tear the fibres at a microscopic level and vastly reduce the efficacy. </p>
<p>Then you have Washing, which breaks up fibres. And if your not using a high temp hospital washing machine, it's unlikely to actually clean the mask effectively. </p>
<p>Masks are ineffective, and the herd mentality to enforce them as a "safe" way to do things, is asinine.</p>

        <p>I'll format / clarify better; because I'm not <em>missing</em> your point, I'm <em>addressing</em> them. Your point is clear as day: Sweden's lockdown-free, mask-free policies aren't contributing to excessive morality rates (in a nutshell).</p>
<p>I'm saying the statistics you used to say that Sweden's overall mortality rate is on par/better than average (per year basis) is not conclusive because:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-sweden-death-reporting">How Sweden reports their deaths is different than the rest of the European countries.</a> Any conclusion that compares Sweden to another European country, that doesn't acknowledge this, needs to pay more attention.</li>
<li>Statistically speaking, this changes everything. How does anyone extract meaningful takeaways if data collection methods are inconsistent?</li>
<li>Therefore, graphs such as  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ewz5nfq">https://imgur.com/a/ewz5nfq</a> is not accurate.</li>
<li><em>Even if death reports were consistent</em> - the more updated information, taken from the same organization, shows Sweden actually <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;country=European%20Union~SWE~GBR~NOR&amp;region=World&amp;casesMetric=true&amp;interval=daily&amp;hideControls=true&amp;perCapita=true&amp;smoothing=0&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;pickerSort=asc">spiking in cases just like the rest of the European countries</a>. So the graph in the previous bullet is <em>still</em> inaccurate.</li>
<li>In fact, Sweden's mortality rate went from <a href="https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2020/07/03/covid-19-deaths-in-sweden/">35 per 100,000</a> (May 15) to <a href="https://time.com/5899432/sweden-coronovirus-disaster/">58 per 100,000</a> (Oct 13).</li>
<li>Note: We also can't conclude Sweden's policies are <em>worse</em> either (from this information).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/525353/sweden-number-of-deaths/">overall year-to-year death rate</a> is not enough to conclude Sweden's policies are better. There are so many non-COVID factors to consider: did they get a new health minister at once point? Was there a surplus in taxes to spend on socialized medicine? My point here is we need to establish <em>constants</em>. We need <em>regression analysis</em> and <em>p-values</em>. That's something we surely can agree on. Analysis trumps visual speculation any day.</p>
<p>Additionally, "Sweden being <em>on track</em> to have equal or less deaths this year" means <em>we don't actually know until Dec 31.</em> Anything else is speculation. <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1105753/cumulative-coronavirus-deaths-in-sweden/">This graph maybe showing that COVID deaths are on the verge to increase again</a>.</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>I noticed you're saying "cases don't matter" and "masks don't do anything". Can you clarify how you think improper masks contribute to spreading COVID but at the same time, getting infected doesn't matter? Why would Person X care about transmitting the virus if cases don't matter? I feel two conflicting arguments here - or maybe I'm just misinterpreting.</p>

        <p>Again, WuFlu deaths don't matter. The excess deaths run into the following month by 8 days in order to accommodate for any extra deaths. Morso, the last few days in a month is unlikely to have a couple thousand deaths. Not sure what you're trying to prove there. </p>
<p>The Imgur graph isn't deaths. It's cases.</p>
<p>Your graph is simply more up to date. Morso, that's still just cases. Not deaths. On top of that, if the only observable different between lockdowns and no lockdowns is.... Nothing as both see a surge in cases. There's no point in a lockdown. </p>
<p>Counties tend to see higher mortality rates going into late fall/winter due to the normal flu anyhow. As I've pointed out, they still need an absurd ammount of deaths for this year's mortality rate to go excess.</p>
<p>I disagree. Universal healthcare is trash as is. New health ministers don't do a whole lot at the patient level. If less people died during a global pandemic, that means they did something right.</p>
<p>Yes we won't know until January 8th, given their reporting seems to overlap by 8 days. That doesn't mean you can't make educated guesses.</p>
<p>Cases don't matter due to the fact that testing is unreliable, and has huge amounts of false positives. Morso, cases have more correlation with testing availability and the testing rate than actual deaths. There are many times you can see cases rise in a country, but deaths stay stagnant. </p>
<p>With a hospitalization rate of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1122354/covid-19-us-hospital-rate-by-age/">178/100k</a>, that means a lot of people who are symptomatic, or "test" positive, can simply stay at home.</p>
<p>Cases are nothing more than a scary number the media switches to when the deaths start to go down. If you watch legacy media, if they talk about cases, look up the deaths in the area they're talking about. It's true most of the time. </p>

<p>&rt; Yes we won't know until January 8th, given their reporting seems to  overlap by 8 days. That doesn't mean you can't make educated guesses. </p>
<p>We can also make the educated guess that the recent rise in covid-related deaths (which don't matter to you) are due to businesses opening up. We can differ on our guesses, this isn't a hill to die on.</p>
<p>&rt; Cases don't matter due to the fact that testing is unreliable, and has  huge amounts of false positives...There are  many times you can see cases rise in a country, but deaths stay stagnant. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=italy+covid+deaths">And deaths are reportedly increasing again</a>. Feel free to substitute Italy with another country. Death decreases when lockdown starts. Death increases when businesses open up. In any case, the whole point of lockdowns is to prevent hospitals from getting overflooded.</p>

<p>178 is the <em>average</em>, we both know that population density matters in this case. For the cities or countries with high density and above average hospitalization, their hospitals are struggling. I personally don't think letting everyone roam around like usual is the smartest.</p>
<p>&rt; Cases are nothing more than a scary number the media switches to when  the deaths start to go down. If you watch legacy media, if they talk  about cases, look up the deaths in the area they're talking about. It's  true most of the time. </p>
<p>Good thing I don't watch legacy media. I simply think you can't have deaths without cases first. And slowing the spreading rate is the main goal of lockdowns.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Please see my first comment in responding to most of those anti-mask articles. I'm asking for your thoughts, not links.</p>
<p>To be clear: you think masks don't matter + lockdowns don't matter --&rt; spreading virus doesn't matter --because --&rt; cases don't matter --&rt; deaths don't matter? And COVID will only matter if deaths reach a certain threshold?</p>

        <p>Few things, first of all at least use per capita.</p>
<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/</p>
<p>Second, I'm talking about excess deaths. The following numbers aren't perfect, this is an example.</p>
<p>If in 2019 Sweden had 70k deaths, and in 2020 Sweden has 10k deaths attributed to the WuFlu, how many total deaths would you expect Sweden to have in 2020? 80k.</p>
<p>So what happens if they still get 70k deaths? What does that mean? What happens when the amount of alleged WuFlu deaths end up not impacting the overall death rate? </p>
<p>The point is that the WuFlu deaths don't matter, if they don't impact the overall death toll. Otherwise, all those people likely would have died anyhow. As we know it's likely, with the 94% of deaths having an average of 2.6+ comorbidities. This is why the deaths don't matter. </p>
<p>It's highly unlikely that Sweden has been able to drop it's overall deaths by 10% in one year no matter what you claim.</p>
<p>The death reports are accurate. They're a little delayed, which the source takes into consideration.</p>
<p>Sweden never had businesses close in the first place. </p>
<p>Look at that Italy graph, and change it to cases. There's a lack of a spike in March/may. </p>
<p>Average <em>across the ages</em>. It's per 100k,  and scales for higher population centers.</p>
<p>Masks cause more people to get ill, or at best, do nothing. All lockdowns do is prevent herd immunity and push deaths back to a single breaking point. </p>
<p>Cases, as a statistic don't matter. If someone said "California has 10k more cases compared to last week", that means nothing. Cases aren't a valuable resource. It doesn't tell you anything of importance, such as hospitalizations, or deaths. If you think that cases and deaths are linked, then cases don't matter as you get the same information from deaths, do you not? </p>
<p>Spreading the virus matters in a few ways. You want it spread to the young and healthy in order to build up herd immunity. You want to keep it away from the elderly and at risk as they are far more likely to die. </p>
<p>WuFlu deaths only matter if they go above average deaths. Otherwise there's a net 0 change in deaths during a pandemic, which just sounds idiotic.</p>

        <p>Interesting that it doesn't debunk any of my claims then. All I'm saying is too many people are dying to this virus and our actions are causing it. Please take your head out of the sand and think about the thousands of families losing people.</p>

        <p>What's too many? 650k die in America annually from cardiovascular issues, and far more die from complications related to obesity. Should we ban McDonald's and coke? The vast majority of the deaths were those who likely would have died within a few years as is, given the average age of death is in the 80s. In some states, the average age of death is higher than the life expectancy.</p>
<p>We should Quarantine the elderly, but there's no reason to put any restrictions on the young and healthy.</p>

<p>You all love to twist the advice to make it sound way worse that it actually is. </p>
<p>"Don't be around a lot of people" is very reasonable advice given how deadly and contagious Covid is , "Don't ever go outside" is ridiculous and there is no official advocating that. </p>
<p>Just don't be around people without a mask on. That's the advice. </p>

<p>The Gall of the governor to think he can tell grown adults who to associate with. </p>
<p>Last night I attended a house party with 30+ people. The hosts rules were </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dont GPS to this address choose a public address (macys, home depot, town park) close by to minimize the possibility google is sharing congregation data </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travel in groups if possible or uber in to reduce the number of cars outside on account of some nosy neighbors </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a great time </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Party was in the huge basement, all decked out. Some spill over to the 2nd floor living room home theater. </p>
<p>No masks in sight, zero fucks given, most of us didnt know each other but were connected through the host family</p>

        <p>This is a brilliant meme, because the girl in the picture is a spoiled, entitled, uneducated teenager on Dr. Phil. I'm sure she's quite the relatable figure for all of you! Only difference is, she's not willfully endangering others, which makes her something to aspire to for you guys :)</p>
