    <strong>I give up</strong>
    <p><p>All my elder sisters and my elder brother are forcing my parents to get the vaccine , I told them not to get the vaccine ( well they said no infront of me ) but I think they would be forced to get the vaccine because of my siblings , I explained to them the side effects and showed them the proof of the  side effects , I showed them how girls are getting infertile and how the skins are getting peeled off , but my siblings are calling me dumb conspiracy theorist and they are mocking me , they also said that I should get the vaccine too and they might book  a appointment for me as well as  the whole family. I told them about the blood clots and the side effects , you know what their response was ? We are not taking the pfzier or Astra zeneca vaccines but the Indian ones ü§¶ we are apparently going to Maldives this summer and my siblings told me not to come , they are using emotional blackmail and other methods to convince me to get the vaccine , and my pregnant sister is also getting the vaccine , well for more than 1 hour I showed them proof about the vaccines , educated them about the new world order / agenda 2030, great reset,  but to no avail . I also told them that the vaccines will only reduce the symptoms ( you can still catch covid ) I also told them that if anything happens to them the vaccine manufacturers will not be responsible , I also told them that you still  have to wear masks and social distance after receiving the vaccine , at first they asked for proof bruh like it's there in the caller tune ( atleast in my country ) I also showed them some videos , they said that other family members and friends took the vaccine and they are fine ( aside from some mild fever , coughing , deep sleep for 22 hours , vomiting and other side effects etc ) they said that it's perfectly normal , I told them short term you will be fine but what about long term ? They told me that I am the smaller sibling so I should not have any opinion lol , anyways for the sake of my own mental health I had to back off ,  I also told them about the Tanzanian president and the samples which he sent and how he mysteriously died and how  coincidentally the Tanzanian variant became the deadliest variant till date ( they called him a covidiot and lame )  I literally covered all the topics and I exposed this plandemic ( even covered event 201 , Wuhan lab , the bats on the USA coin , the foreshadowing etc ) they all laughed   it off . It  was a family gathering and I spoiled the vibe üòÇ well now I want the elite to succeed with their  new world order / great reset / agenda 2030 or whatever they call it , so that I can have a told you so moment ( I bet even after that they would call me a idiot and conspiracy theorist) honestly I am tired / annoyed and I am fucking pissed but what can I do ?</p></p>

        <p>You've done what you can, maybe keep fighting for your parents.</p>
<p>And do NOT compromise on your own wellbeing due to emotional blackmail or anything else.</p>
<p>3-5 years, you'll have your "I told you so moment."</p>
<p>Welldone on trying.</p>

        <p>Well my parents used to abuse me when I was young ( not anymore tho , they also apologized , my siblings used to lie to my parents about me and get me beaten up  )  I think none of my siblings love me , they even said that if they had to use force for me to get vaccinated than so be it , honestly they are beyond brainwashed , they say that I should not trust the media when it comes to Muslims / Islam , I agree with that , media lied about 9/11 , Iraq war , libya war , Syria war etc  but when it comes to covid I should blindly trust the media ü§° well I can see through the deception , the elite pushed for wars in the middle East that created refugees , those refugees ended up in Europe ( since the cultures , languages , race and religions were different ) it caused a clash between two civilisations and I we all  know who benefits from it , well thanks for those kind words dear stranger ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
