    <strong>If ignorant mask lovers ask you where we're getting this "insane" idea that masks don't work here ya go.</strong>
    <p><p>Here's an article how shitty masks are from a Surgeon and former editor of a medical Journal. </p>
<p>https://cnsnews.com/index.php/commentary/dr-jim-meehan/surgeon-destroys-myth-if-masks-dont-work-why-do-surgeons-wear-them</p>
<p>"Based on extensive review and analysis, there is no question in my mind that healthy people should not be wearing surgical or cloth masks. Nor should we be recommending universal masking of all members of the population."</p>
<p>And here's the study he cites. I personally think the CDC is a garbage organization wasting tax payer money but mask lovers cite them all the time so here ya go. </p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>It even states that masks don't work on stopping the flu so that myth about how Covid protections are what caused the drop on flu are also 100% BULLSHIT</p>
<p>"RESULTS
In this review, we did not find evidence to support a protective effect of personal protective measures or environmental measures in reducing influenza transmission."</p>
<p>Masks don't work well, but especially in the fashion an overwhelming majority of them are being used.
We are wearing bacteria collecting shit rags on our face. All in the name of health. Its literally the stupidest thing we could do. </p>
<p>Meanwhile a year into the pandemic and not one single word on how to improve your health. Despite the fact that approximately 80% of the Hospitalizations are coming from people who are obese. </p>
<p>The simple fact is we wouldn't be in a "Pandemic" if half the country weren't obese sitting home stuffing their face with Booze, soda, and take out while sitting their lazy asses at home and using "the pandemic" as an excuse to not go to the gym or even work out at all. </p>
<p>https://www.nhregister.com/opinion/amp/Preventive-Medicine-Studying-COVID-19-and-obesity-16024817.php</p>
<p>These lockdown measures have nothing to do with health. The government has never cared about your health and historically theyve signed off on and advocated for things we find later are awful for your health.</p>
<p>if you ate, drank, and sat your ass around till it go so fat that routine viruses start to become death flus, then its probably time to grow up and take responsibility for yourself and your actions. Instead of selfishly cheering on authoritarian mandates that ruin every healthy person's life just to keep you safe.</p></p>

        <p>If anything face shields would have made more sense than masks, but the CDC saw it was a great way to create a dystopian situation and also a way to severely discriminate against people unable to wear masks.  There ought to be a class action lawsuit against the CDC for discrimination.</p>

        <p>Masks in an operating room are to prevent blood or other fluids from getting into the surgeons mouth or nose, though a face shield or goggles would be more useful at keeping bodily fluids off the face.</p>
