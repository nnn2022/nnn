        <p>No, Lil' Marco, Fauci didn't lie about masks. He was simply telling the truth as it stood before he received his marching orders. He is <em>currently</em> lying, however.</p>

        <p>Problem here is that Rubio is claiming masks are good and that we should have been wearing them from the beginning.  He's a fucking moron because it takes literally two seconds to look around at states/countries with strict mask mandates and see they don't work.</p>

        <p>I live and work in Houston, the fourth-largest city in America. You cannot enter ANY establishment in Houston / Harris County without a mask. The only time I see people unmasked in public is when they're walking alone outside, or driving. Sometimes they unmask when they stop to pump gas.</p>
<p>And I'm an ardent anti-masker, so I'm on super high alert to see no-mask happenings. Trust me, if Houston can make everyone mask up, other cities are doing it as well.</p>

<p>An "ardent anti-masker".  Is that about freedom?  Are you a nudist too that refuses to wear a seatbelt or obey speed limits?  Is it about oxygen levels because you think you need more oxygen than marathon runners?  Or do you just believe everything Trump tells you?</p>
<p>No need to reply, I know I was snarky, because this thread is going nowhere.  Nobody here has the ability to back their claims with anything other than "dur, I'm from Houston and I know everybody on the planet is exactly the same as me!"</p>

<p>&rt; and are clearly pretending you're not aware that nearly all businesses require customers and employees to wear masks to enter.</p>
<p>I am absolutely not saying that in any way, shape, or form.  You are having trouble reading.  What I am clearly saying is the mandates are not being enforced consistently.  That is a disagreement, supported by public reports and my own experience which I provided.  When you figure out the basis of your claim that most business are enforcing the mandates, you be sure to let me know.</p>

<p>So here is a nice summary of the statements being made nationwide.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here is one from Fox about Arkansas specifically.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/arkansas-police-coronavirus-mask-orders-refuse-enforce">https://www.foxnews.com/us/arkansas-police-coronavirus-mask-orders-refuse-enforce</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here is the actual statement from the Sacramento County (California) Sheriff's office, as reported by Breitbart:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/06/19/ssacramento-sheriff-refuses-to-enforce-newsoms-mask-order/">https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/06/19/ssacramento-sheriff-refuses-to-enforce-newsoms-mask-order/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here is Newsmax talking about Michigan:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/politics/michigan-whitmer-masks-coronavirus/2020/07/13/id/976986/">https://www.newsmax.com/politics/michigan-whitmer-masks-coronavirus/2020/07/13/id/976986/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So what I'm getting at is:  why should anybody listen to your personal experience, with a clearly misinformed basis?</p>

        <p>Because they're right. You just have to leave the computer and go outside in order to see what's actually happening. Masks are being enforced. You have to wear one to go inside anywhere, and there will be trouble if you don't.</p>

        <p>Holy shit...  Is this what this sub is all about?  Ignoring anything that disagrees with your ignorant assumptions?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Like most other Republican areas with Republican leadership downplaying the risks, law enforcement in my area stated they would not enforce, and do not enforce the state mandates.  Store owners/managers I have personally spoken to explicitly stated they do not enforce the mandate in their own stores because:</p>
<ol>
<li>The police do not enforce it</li>
<li>Local opposition to the mandate results in abused workers that do try to enforce it.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I live it.  Daily.  <strong>AND</strong> I have the public statements of law enforcement nationwide. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So lets try this again, other than my personal experience which is meaningless, and your personal experience which is also meaningless, what do you have?</p>

        <p>The masks and the mandates that we have are not beneficial at all. If we all had fit tested n95s that were sanitized like they are supposed to be then MAYBE it would help. The dirty cloth masks that people are wearing constantly and also picking and pulling after touching surfaces are only adding to our problems. Now you maybe able to argue that viral load is less due to masks, but cases are still rising.</p>

        <p>&rt;The masks and the mandates that we have are not beneficial at all</p>
<p>Yes, we're beyond that already.  The claim was made.  Restating it doesn't help.  The question I have is:  how do you know?  The spotty enforcement of mask mandates is, I thought, well known.  The high number of law enforcement agencies, especially in rural areas, publicly stating their refusal to enforce them; the number of restaurants refusing to abide by occupancy restrictions; the number of anti-mask freedom rallies; Trump rallies; the infection rates in more densely populated nations with strict enforcement of mask mandates...  The evidence is endless.  A significant percentage of the US population is not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>&rt;The dirty cloth masks that people are wearing constantly and also picking and pulling after touching surfaces are only adding to our problems. </p>
<p>Like this assumption.  It seems you're suggesting that masks actually increase infection rates...  like stopping infected droplets of virus containing fluids from flying across the room every time an infected person speaks or breathes better, and/or that it would be better if people touched their faces directly rather than touched a mask that provides yet another reminder to not touch their faces.  That sounds bat-shit crazy to me.  So I would think something that counter-intuitive would come with some solid backup.  There is tons of published research specifically on the effectiveness of masks in different situations.</p>
<p>&rt;Now you maybe able to argue that viral load is less due to masks, but cases are still rising.</p>
<p>May be able to argue?  Like, you may be able to argue gravity exists?  Masks help.  The evidence is overwhelming.  Scientific research.  The state of various nations like Taiwan, Japan &amp; South Korea compared to UK, US, &amp; Sweden.</p>
<p>Masks help.  That has been consistently indisputable.  The understanding of exactly how effective they are in various situations has matured, but they have always helped.  But still, again, if you have some kind of credible sources to back your position I'd be interested.</p>

        <p>Show me where mask mandates have helped. If you are blind enough to not see it is a way for the government to pass the buck to the people then I can't help you. If cases go down its because the government did a good job of enforcing mask wearing. If cases go up its the people's fault because they didn't wear them. The mask mandates should show some sort of improvement somewhere and they haven't. I didn't say masks don't work. I said what we have doesn't. I believe better hygiene would be more beneficial. This study also discusses how much bacteria is trapped on masks. Now if everyone is touching and pulling their masks and then touch surfaces it surely can't help.</p>

<p>That would be a false dichotomy with the assumption that if masks are worn, they are worn perfectly and everybody is obeying the request.  THAT assumption is what I am challenging here.</p>
<p>&rt; The mask mandates should show some sort of improvement somewhere and they haven't.</p>
<p>That is another assumption you're making.  A huge assumption that completely ignores the virus' characteristics and the actual habits of the people involved.  And again, you have not established the mandates are being used effectively.  You're effectively claiming that seatbelts don't work because there are still car crash deaths.  Even worse, you haven't even established the baseline.  "some sort of improvement"... from... what?</p>
<p>&rt; I didn't say masks don't work.</p>
<p>Yes you did.  You said exactly that.  Explicitly.  Here is the quote (emphasis mine):</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>The masks</strong> and the mandates that we have <strong>are not beneficial at all</strong>.</p>
<p>There is no way to interpret your statement and conclude that masks work.</p>
<p>&rt;This study also discusses how much bacteria is trapped on masks.</p>
<p>Covid is not bacteria or fungus.  I thought that was well-known.  I'm not interested in trying to find common ground to have a discussion with somebody that not only has no clue what they just said but also thinks covid is bacteria.  Or that re-using surgical masks somehow proves a mask mandate is being enforced effectively.  You did help me understand the purpose of this sub though.  Thanks for that.</p>
