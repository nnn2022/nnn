    <strong>I thought I was starting to see the light- WRONG.</strong>
    <p><p>I can't believe how many people just listen to whatever nonsense and self-contradicting bullshit the media is feeding them, it's insane. I thought most of them were just following the ridiculous security theater mandates and waiting for either this to end or the sweet release of death. But today I went to an outdoor farmer's market and an older woman called the farmers market coordinators (or whatever they're called) because a young guy wasn't wearing a mask. And this woman was hysterical, screaming that this guy was killing her husband. I didn't see said husband. The young guy calmly told her that he and everyone can keep their distance if they're worried, and this lady gets in his face to yell at him some more (with a shitty cloth mask, of course. You know, the one that blocks all diseases). So of course more people gang up around this guy to make him feel even more like shit and he remained calm the entire time, but was visibly scared. And the market coordinators were panicking and all on their walkie-talkies like he had a fucking bomb on him. </p>
<p>This was an an <strong>outdoor</strong> market. With a maximum capacity, so you could definitely keep a distance from others. Once you step out of the bounds of the market (aka plastic cones), you dont need a mask. How people are not thinking this is completely illogical and instead they become completely hysterical is beyond me. It was the most 1984 moment I've seen in-person since this circus started. As I walked home, I paid close attention to the people walking around- most are already starting to have the expressionless, dead looks in their eyes. The people without masks gave the subtle smile and nod, the others just looked forward and kept walking. Mind you, I did not walk through crowded areas where I saw these people. It was surreal, and I don't think this will go away- the media and government did a phenomenal job of instilling irrational fear and brainwashing.</p></p>

        <p>I hear you! Sometimes I feel like I'm the only normal person in Invasion of the Body Snatchers and any moment now somebody is going to point and hiss at me. An elderly lady yelled at me from the sidewalk the other day how I was a disgrace and a danger to society for not wearing a mask. Outside. From 5 meters away. Surreal.</p>

        <p>I had my mask bellow my nose and a lady walked by and made a snide remark about it.  I just said “deal with it lady”. After that she just stormed off. </p>
<p>It is indeed sad how we’ve become.  This plus all the other shit going on, is why I believe we are living in a civil war among ourselves.</p>

        <p>It is trually horrifying how emotionless everyone is becoming unless they are confronted by the hysteria inducting behavior of daring to go maskless. At first i was just going along with it so i could go about my day without indicent but now i am honestly moving closer to those not wearing a mask because they are saner and by far less terrifying. I never understood why movie monsters who wear masks were so horrifying until now.</p>

<p>(Though, for real, you guys are in deep denial for believing that people aren't just being crazy with fear right now. People continue to use Occam's Razor to explain away the aspects they disagree with, but for stuff like this, they'll jump right to conclusions like this one.)</p>

        <p>The government itself spends millions promoting the facemask propaganda among other things. What makes you think it's impossible to have those who are paid to create the facemask incidents? You think there are only those who are afraid?</p>

<p>I also went for a run the other day (also outdoors), and this young woman was running towards me in the opposite direction. This is a closed motor vehicle road, so PLENTY of space for people. This woman, <strong>while running</strong>, pulls her mask on and looks at me in horror. I even pull myself 20ish feet away and tell her it's OK, she doesn't need pull her mask up for me (I have asthma so I will not wear a fucking face diaper while running, but I was not wheezing or anything since I medicate before my runs). As she runs by me, her eyes were widened like I had blood splattered all over me- she didn't pull up the mask for others. This early-20s woman pulled up the mask because everyone else is a murderer. I didn't think this situation was as significant as the other one, maybe because it happened so fast, but I guess it stuck with me enough to bring my attention to what the world is <em>actually</em> like, and it's not like what I was hoping.</p>

        <p>LMAO. More seriously, sorry that happened to you. </p>
<p>My story (Ontario, Canada). We're not required to wear masks outside the library. While I was standing by the curbside pick-up sign, waiting for them to bring out my book and put it on the shelf, a lady who was still wearing her mask while going out down the library steps stared at me in fear and horror. </p>
<p>While returning said book, still not even entering the library, I received a look of fear and terror from a mother with her kids (all masked, before even entering the building). I almost said, "Don't worry, me and my unmasked face aren't going inside!" But I decided to say nothing. This is in a town that has had 0 cases since June, and all the cases pre-June were from a long-term care home (staff and residents).</p>

        <p>I was in New Jersey yesterday, and there was a ton of fear and panic at a Walmart I stopped at. People looked even more paranoid than they did in PA. I went to grab something at vending machine, and this woman next to me at a Redbox looked terrified, she began to mash the buttons to try to expediate her order while I was there. Spouse and I walked behind a couple with their kid, and they also looked scared because we weren't quite six feet apart.</p>

        <p>That is insane. Fortunately people like that woman who started this hysteria are a small number of people, but others need to get enough courage to resist this sort of thing when they see it. It's the only solution to this insanity.</p>

        <p>I worked in a similar outdoor market until all this.  The market was packed every day until all this started and they just BARELY let it reopen in July.</p>
<p>Now there are only 1/3 of the spaces allowed to be open, nobody set up near one another.  Masks mandatory at all times.  Vendors have to wear gloves and provide hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>Sounds like a really fun place to shop right?  Well that doesn't matter either because it was heavily dependent on tourists and the mayor/governor cancelled all tourism events for a year so it's not like there is anyone to sell to anyway.</p>
<p>So now there are like 5 vendors just sitting around doing nothing all day.</p>
<p>The reddit for my city is depressing too because they constantly post pictures of tourists that do show up tearing them down for "spreading the virus" while also bemoaning all the businesses disappearing.</p>
