        <p>There is a lot of lawyers that would take that case, Because it is an easy win, This is also why most big stores dont say shit when you walk in without one because they know they dont have a leg to stand on.</p>

        <p>Yes, yes they are, the fact that people can have a medical exemption means 2 things</p>
<p>1: it goes against the HIPAA to ask someone to wear one publicly, Because they now have to disclose they have a medical condition to defend them self's</p>
<p>2: If they are denied or fined after that it breaks the ADA</p>
<p>Also these are both the laws that will stop any  "Prof of vaccination to enter" laws that they are thinking of as well, that wont stop other country's from doing it but anywhere in America you are free to travel without needing medical documentation.</p>
<p>Because a person should never have to publicly disclose that they have a medical condition it is no ones business but the person and their doctors.</p>
<p>And the ADA starts out with a 75k$ fine, that is not including the personal harassment suit you can file after,</p>

        <p>Other customers are a problem too, I just had an occurrence kind of recently. The woman pointed to and I'm pretty sure touched her mask (contaminating it in the process!), indicating I should put one on. I'm a complete stranger to her! Of course she just assumes "she doesn't want to wear a mask" not that I can't. When I ignored her, she went on to make comments to herself and I guess anyone willing to listen about "denying service" (yeah, if the company wants a lawsuit! people need to know their rights for sure). When she finished buying her stuff, she stayed for 5 or 10 minutes in a b*tch session with the employee about masks. She's a hypocrite too, because she bought cigarettes. There were many things I could have said to her and she'd probably sputter trying to come up with a reply.</p>

        <p>A random store manager is not prohibited my HIPAA to ask you about your condition that precludes you from wearing a mask. But you can say WHATEVER YOU WANT bc the only way to confirm what you say is true is to contact a health professional to ask to who IS bound by HIPAA. Make sense?</p>

        <p>It is on them in a sense, though.  If I go into a restaurant with a peanut allergy, I don't have to tell them what I'm allergic to...I can just ask for a menu with allergy info or ingredient info and make the decision based on that.  Now, it is smarter for me to say it so that the chef is aware, but technically, it is on the restaurant to provide me with the right info and not on me to tell them all the details related to my allergy.</p>

        <p>Masks don't even stop viruses, but they do cause harm. Why can't people understand this? Because they want to believe one set of experts but not another. Somehow the mainstream set is correct but the "against the narrative" set is wrong. No, the science hasn't changed, and the science states "masks don't stop viruses but do cause harm to the wearer". It's even on the box of masks, at least sometimes "doesn't stop covid". What dumb excuse do people come up with to the mask box???<br>

        <p>In the beginning of the pandemic, Fauci said not to wear masks. He recommended them a few months later. Because I know you have been “following the science,” could you point me to the data that came to light between Fauci’s flip flop?</p>

        <p>Yes. Here is a direct quote from Fauci: </p>
<p>“...Back then, the critical issue was to save the masks for the people who really needed them because it was felt there was a shortage of masks. Also, we didn’t realize, at all, the extent of asymptomatic spread. And that a person without symptoms at all could be inadvertently and innocently spreading it to someone who was uninfected.” </p>
<p>Toilet paper and hand sanitizer was hard to get pretty quickly so it takes no stretch of the imagination of how much quicker the already limited supply of masks and other PPE might have gone.</p>

        <p>Okay so that’s why Fauci flipped? He was lying to us in the beginning? Because he thinks he knows what’s best for everyone? That is certainly beyond his expertise. </p>
<p>Science gives us information. Not direction. Once you start to think about direction, credentials stop mattering. It’s a matter of values at that point.</p>

        <p>Fauci was chosen as the public health spokesperson for the office of the president, so he is a representative chosen by the government elected by the American people. </p>
<p>My sincerely apologies that you weren’t chosen as this spokesperson. You must also be an expert in the field of pandemics to think Fauci was in beyond his expertise. Best of luck on the next pandemic!  </p>
<p>To think the government will not have an agenda in most/all courses of their action is naive — there was also immense pressure from doctors and other medical personnel who were actually in close contact continuously with covid positive patients to have PPE available — so it would appear a decision had to be made based on the information available at the time.</p>

        <p>No, because the store can ask if you have a disability that prevents wearing a mask just like they can ask if your service dog assists with your disability.  They cannot ask for details, though.  So, the acknowledgement of a disability due to parking tag would be the same thing.</p>

        <p>It shouldn't be and there are medical and religious exemptions to the rule, its also done between 2 medical professionals all the school knows at that point is that records were received they dont know what shots if any or if the person had an exemption  so unless every business in America wants to Hire a medical professional on staff for each of its store's,  its not going to happen and people would fight it, business would fight it because that would be to pricey and would stop most business from opening ever again. and I dont think there are enough medical professionals in America to do such a thing.</p>
<p>Also the kids dont need to carry prof with them again it is done between to medical professionals for something like that to work for stores you would need to carry prof with you everywhere you go, and if you advocate for that how very Nazi of you.</p>

        <p>The schools at least where I'm at definitely know which shots you got. Considering they gave out flu shots and had your paperwork all sitting out, they do hearing and vision tests at my school too. The schools know way too much about me and I don't even attend anymore yet they still have all my medical information</p>

        <p>A store doesn't care whether someone purchases their goods whilst being inside vs purchasing goods online to be placed in their car via curbside pickup.</p>
<p>The store gets the money for the goods all the same.</p>
<p>I, however, have seen plenty of stores willing to lose sales by removing customers who refuse to use curbside pick up.</p>
<p>It seems to me like retail spaces are adapting and accommodating people who choose to not wear masks.</p>
<p>But the people who choose to not wear masks refuse to use the services made to accommodate them specifically.</p>

        <p>Depending on the store, yes the do care. Some stores, many stores, make a lot of money on purchases that people only make once inside the store. Think about all the stuff at the register. </p>
<p>Now you might be right about the situation I mentioned earlier. They can probably ask you. But you can say whatever you would like and they can’t prove or disprove it bc 1)people don’t need to carry medical history cards and 2)any person relevant to cofnirming those medical conditions IS bound by HIPAA laws.</p>

        <p>We're at a place economically where if you're still relying on impulse purchases at the register, you <em>may</em> be in massive trouble.</p>
<p>They can certainly ask you to leave. And if they have services available to provide you with all of the goods you need from the comfort of your vehicle, then the business is completely within the law to remove you from the premises.</p>
<p>I'll repeat myself here: Retail spaces have been nothing but accommodating for people who choose to not wear masks. However, those who choose to not wear masks refuse to use the accommodations.</p>
<p>I dont understand this dichotomy. </p>
<p>People who don't want to wear masks are being specifically catered to. Yet, from their reactions, you would think they weren't. </p>
<p>People are just trying to keep their businesses open. People are just trying to control their livelihoods. To be able to pay their rent.</p>
<p>I fail to see why the feeling of not wanting to wear a mask outweighs that economic reality in some peoples minds.</p>
<p>I want to underdstand, but I just can't. </p>
<p>Why do you even want to go into a store without a mask instead of using accommodations like curbside pickup?</p>

<p>I was talking about the store. You said the store wants in-person shoppers because they may rely on things like quick impulse purchases at the register.</p>
<p>I'm simply saying our economy is beyond being saved by buying gum at the register, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>This is really indisputable. Do you think Trump wants $2000 stimulus checks because he's just a giving kind of guy?</p>
<p>&rt;They are completely within the law to ASK me to leave. There’s a reason employees are told not to confront crazy people. The store gets sued.</p>
<p>I like how you know it's crazy. Yeah. People have been killed by anti-maskers simply for being asked to wear a mask or leave. I'm here trying to understand where that mindset comes from, beyond pure selfishness.</p>
<p>&rt;Let me fix your repeated shit: retail spaces have been nothing but accommodating but people who live in fear. They spend extra money on cleaning, they provide sanitizer, the put up plastic guards between customer and register. These are HUGE expenses. </p>
<p>....are you paying these expenses?</p>
<p>I'm talking about curbside pick up. If you dont want to wear a mask in the store, there is the option of having the goods purchased online and brought to your vehicle. This is nothing but accommodation for people who aren't comfortable with going inside whilst following covid-19 restrictions. </p>
<p>&rt;Let’s be clear here: The curb side services are catered to people who do not want to expose themselves to unnecessary risk. Not the people who don’t want to wear a mask.</p>
<p>So why should the people who choose to follow store protocol be forced to be around people who refuse to follow store protocol? The store has given you a legal way to shop, they don't have to let you in the door.</p>
<p>Except they will, because a 19 year old working for minimum wage doesn't want to get killed by a psychotic person.</p>
<p>Why does the idea of wearing masks drive some people to kill others?</p>
<p>&rt;The pro-mask people are complicit in the hysteria that has ruined many people’s lives. Corona, in general, doesn’t ruin people’s lives. It just speeds up people’s exit from this world.... people who have lived full hopefully happy lives.</p>
<p>Is this an unironic let grandma die for the economy take?</p>
<p>&rt;Every old person I’ve talked to says something along the lines of “I’ve lived my life, it’s your turn now.” Why are we stealing from the young to give to the old? Ask your grandparents please.</p>
<p>You want me to ask my grandparents if they're fine with dying from not being able to use their lungs anymore?</p>
<p>Is this supposed to convince me that wearing masks is bad in any way?</p>
<p>&rt;What about the reality that we are impeding natural social and immunity development in children growing up these days? </p>
<p>Youre right. I really wish schools would have used the time between Spring Break 2020 and the beginning of this school year to actually create a distanced learning experience. </p>
<p>I have a kid in school, I know a lot about this. We can talk about this if you want, if you're willing to discuss in good faith.</p>
<p>&rt;We aren’t letting them learn facial patterns and how to read people.</p>
<p>Kids can still recognize facial patterns through masks, as can I...are you unable to do so?</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201223142452.htm</p>
<p>&rt;We aren’t exposing them to ANY germs, so we are going to have two generations of kids with TONS of allergies and asthma. </p>
<p>Sure kids are being exposed to germs. Person to person contact isn't the only way germs spread. We still go play outside.</p>

        <p>The restaurant that I work at has the option for people to order take-out through a window instead of actually coming into the building. Most of the people who order through there don’t wear a mask. I can understand not wanting to wear a mask when you have the option not to, but I can’t understand why people are so hellbent on trying to harass a minimum wage worker for being told what they’re supposed to do from their work. It’s not like they came up with the rules, they’re literally trying to do their job and go home. People who are able to but refuse to wear a mask inside a store/restaurant and get mad at the worker aren’t being “rebels” or “superheroes” to humanity, you’re just being an asshole to someone who doesn’t deserve it. During this weird time, wearing a mask (if you’re able to) IS supporting local businesses from getting shut down. Regardless of your stance on covid or masks, people just need to stop throwing tantrums to those who don’t have a choice in the matter if they want to keep their jobs.</p>

<p>Some people want to be able to see their purchases in person prior to purchase. So they can choose the freshest produce, the canned goods with the least dents, the right color of paint, the bra that fits best. With online shopping and curbside pickup, you must rely on others to make a selection for you. They might grab the wrong item either on accident or on purpose, and in the case of purchases you've never made before, you can't really be sure an item is what you really want or need based solely on a photograph and some badly written product reviews. Even with purchases you've made before, maybe those bras you bought before are sized differently now or the employee brings you blue-green paint instead of green-blue. These problems might become even more commom when there is a bigger quota of orders to fill because more people are choosing curbside pickup. Maybe it's a risk you're willing to take if you're more affluent, but those with less money can't afford to make a bad purchase.</p>

<p>No one is going to give you the wrong items on purpose. If you receive the wrong items, contact the store and get it worked out.</p>
<p>The way you argue makes it sound like Amazon isn't the biggest retailer on the planet. The dollar doesn't hold in person shopping to the same level of deity that you seem to.</p>
<p>&rt;Even with purchases you've made before, maybe those bras you bought before are sized differently now or the employee brings you blue-green paint instead of green-blue. </p>
<p>Again, you can't try a bra on in-store. Point is moot. If you get the wrong color paint, then go back and get the right color. If you're given a different color then you ordered, return it. Whats so hard?</p>
<p>&rt;These problems might become even more commom when there is a bigger quota of orders to fill because more people are choosing curbside pickup. </p>
<p>You having to return paint or getting a dented can is paltry compared to someone catching covid-19.</p>
<p>&rt;Maybe it's a risk you're willing to take if you're more affluent, but those with less money can't afford to make a bad purchase. </p>
<p>More affluent? </p>
<p>I feel as though the people making purchases beyond the essentials, in January 2021 before stimulus checks have even hit, are the affluent. </p>
<p>Ask the people waiting in the line for food banks if they're buying paint or brand new bras. Spoiler alert: they arent, at least not right now, January 3rd 2021.</p>
<p>You don't lose money if you receive incorrect products via curbside.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you're basically telling me you simply just don't want to be inconvenienced. Whilst ignoring how not wearing a mask could inconvenience others.</p>
<p>I can not be convinced that the act of wearing a mask is more difficult than it is to recover from being covid-19 positive.</p>

        <p>&rt;But the people who choose to not wear masks refuse to use the &rt;services made to accommodate them specifically.</p>
<p>I agree with you on HIPAA but these services were never marketed to accommodate people who refuse to wear a mask. They could require someone to wear a mask on their parking lot outside same as in store. They are all marketed as contactless and to protect the customer. Show me where a store has said no mask, no problem use curbside pickup! You are instructed to keep your window up and keep 6 feet from the store employee!</p>
<p>Also in a lot of cases you will get much slower service using pickup. That has been my experience. You are correct it's the right of any store to deny service. Freedom 101. But that doesn't mean we can't call them out or confront them about it on a daily basis and make it hard for them.</p>

<p>The same news stories are on the other side too where people have been assaulted for not wearing a mask. Crazy people gonna crazy. 
The worst case scenario points you are making are trying to spin the argument in your favor. </p>
<p>It's been like 10 months. The pandemic isn't deadly enough for the response and people are restless. Masks are the reminder of the whole covid-19 shitshow. Similar how police are the tip of the spear for the state so it makes sense they would take the most flak for any injustices the state commits.</p>
<p>&rt;My goal today was to understand that underlying thought process &rt;that results in said confusion on things like HIPAA.</p>
<p>There is no elaborate thought process. People are using HIPAA as a shield to protect themselves against orders they disagree with. On its face it's a strong argument and might actually hold up in court but probably not. It doesn't have to be factually correct, just plausible. This is done all the time to gain support, doesn't make it right. </p>
<p>The state brought this on themselves when they violated private property rights by making it a crime to refuse service to protected classes. And the whole ADA lawyer industrial complex. Now everyone and everything is a protected classification and can claim a right to your property/ if you're "open to the public. I think only private clubs/churches are exempt.</p>

<p>I disagree. Refusing to accommodate to a stores enforcement of a public safety order, simply because you don't want to wait longer for your goods, is the definition of being selfish. Being selfish isn't a valid reason to break public health and safety orders. </p>
<p>&rt;The same news stories are on the other side too where people have been assaulted for not wearing a mask. Crazy people gonna crazy. The worst case scenario points you are making are trying to spin the argument in your favor. </p>
<p>By being assaulted do you mean removed from the premises after being repeatedly asked to leave?</p>
<p>Do you think you're morally right to push back against minimum wage service workers just trying to do their job safely?</p>
<p>&rt;It's been like 10 months. The pandemic isn't deadly enough for the response and people are restless. Masks are the reminder of the whole covid-19 shitshow. Similar how police are the tip of the spear for the state so it makes sense they would take the most flak for any injustices the state commits.</p>
<p>Again, because you're bored and don't feel like waiting isn't a valid reason to do whatever you want. That's an extremely childish and selfish point of view.</p>
<p>&rt;There is no elaborate thought process. People are using HIPAA as a shield to protect themselves against orders they disagree with. On its face it's a strong argument and might actually hold up in court but probably not. It doesn't have to be factually correct, just plausible. This is done all the time to gain support, doesn't make it right. </p>
<p>So straight from the belly of the beast ive heard from multiple people that the HIPAA stuff is all just fake. Yet, I'm also getting people in this sub who are still legitimately saying they have medical issues that prevent them from wearing the mask.</p>
<p>What this is telling me, is that the refusal to wear masks in public spaces is nothing more than when a child throws a tantrum. </p>
<p>I came here with an open mind, honestly. </p>
<p>It's very discouraging that not wearing a mask boils down to "I'm bored and I don't wanna."</p>
<p>Let me ask you:</p>
<p>Do you think everyone wanted to wear masks for this long? Do you think everyone wanted to be still dealing with covid-19 into 2021? We could have been like New Zealand...</p>
<p>&rt;The state brought this on themselves when they violated private property rights by making it a crime to refuse service to protected classes. And the whole ADA lawyer industrial complex. Now everyone and everything is a protected classification and can claim a right to your property/ if you're "open to the public. I think only private clubs/churches are exempt. </p>
<p>Being selfish isn't a protected class.</p>
<p>Anyone with a real medical issue uses the services provided by retailers. Everyone else is being a jerk because they're bored, and that's just terrible.</p>

        <p>I think you are having trouble understanding the viewpoint here because you are coming from a different mindset of collectivism. What would be a valid reason to break a public safety or governors order in your mind? Where is that authority derived? What is the remedy on orders that are destructive or wrong scientifically? There is no point where a public safety order is to be disobeyed from the collectivist view.</p>
<p>No there are videos of customers assaulting others and stalking people around stores for  not wearing masks. I don't understand this "push back against"you are speaking of. Walking to a store without a mask isn't pushing back against minimum wage workers!</p>
<p>Once again painting people as bored and selfish when in their mindset by not pushing back against dehumanization of masks or medical totalitarianism they are being selfish. See how that works? Fight the authority or you don't care about individual rights! It's not some trivial thing to them. Goes both ways.</p>
<p>Yeah medical issues for 30 min or less with a mask is probably a small percentage of the population. They most likely claim that as religious and political exemptions are less accepted by the majority.</p>
<p>Idk what you mean by New Zealand. New Zealand is a small island nation so idk how that is relevant.</p>
<p>I understand the real medical issue argument for mask and breathing. I'm sympathetic to that argument for a small portion of the population.</p>
<p>I could make your same argument dismissing people who disabled. They take up too much space in stores and are too much of a hassle to accommodate. So force them to the curbside or delivery. That would be ridiculous and dehumanizing.</p>
<p>I appreciate you coming to the sub with your ideas. We need more open debate. I think if people thought stores were enacting these guidelines and orders on their own volition, and not at the threat of the state officials, they'd be more open to them. There is no middle ground and that is anti-private property and anti individual rights. If a store was openly against the guidelines and left alone these people would have a choice.</p>

<p>If the public safety order was made when the threat literally did not exist. Fortunately, we certainly do know that the current threat of covid-19 does exist, without any room for debate.</p>
<p>&rt;No there are videos of customers assaulting others and stalking people around stores for not wearing masks. I don't understand this "push back against"you are speaking of. Walking to a store without a mask isn't pushing back against minimum wage workers!</p>
<p>Entering an establishment without a mask, and then refusing to leave when asked is definitely pushing back against minimum wage workers. It isnt their fault that the virus exists. It isnt their fault that its a good idea to wear masks around other people. I find no reason not to leave the minimum wage workers out of this, and let them do their jobs. </p>

<p>Dehumanization of masks? Medical totalitarianism? </p>
<p>That seems to be extreme. It's essentially just another piece of clothing. Do people complain about medical totalitarianism when it comes to washing your hands before performing surgery? I mean, I know they did at first. But everyone realizes how silly that was to do right?</p>
<p>&rt;Yeah medical issues for 30 min or less with a mask is probably a small percentage of the population. They most likely claim that as religious and political exemptions are less accepted by the majority.</p>
<p>And that small percentage of the population has been catered to. They have to claim a medical condition, and then keep it a secret because it's literally the only legal recourse they have.</p>
<p>Too bad businesses still don't have to let you in, they just have to offer a way for you to access their goods and services just like anyone else. I.e. online shopping/ordering, and curbside pickup/delivery.</p>
<p>All bases are covered by the law. Thats why people then revert to "well curbside pickup isnt offered around me."</p>
<p>Yes it is. Businesses are desperate for your money. They'll make it work.</p>
<p>&rt;Idk what you mean by New Zealand. New Zealand is a small island nation so idk how that is relevant.</p>
<p>New Zealand is chilling because they were able to do hard lockdowns along with other forms of mitigating the spread of covid 19. I'm sitting in America "locked down" 10 months later because we've collectively given up on anything but waiting for everyone to be vaccinated. </p>
<p>&rt;I understand the real medical issue argument for mask and breathing. I'm sympathetic to that argument for a small portion of the population.</p>
<p>I'm also sympathetic to anyone who is so physically frail they are unable to wear a mask. I am however, not sympathetic at all to that same persons feeling of entitlement to enter a place of business against thats businesses will. This is America, and a business has the right to refuse service. No shirt, no shoes.</p>
<p>&rt;I could make your same argument dismissing people who disabled. They take up too much space in stores and are too much of a hassle to accommodate. So force them to the curbside or delivery. That would be ridiculous and dehumanizing.</p>
<p>What is dehumanizing is the way you're comparing the dangers of spreading a disease to people who are disabled.</p>
<p>You aren't being asked to stay out of the store as an anti-masker because you take up any amount of space. You're being asked to stay out because you are potentially putting other customers at risk. Disabled people aren't putting others at risk by simply existing. Honestly, what a disgusting comparison man.</p>
<p>&rt;I appreciate you coming to the sub with your ideas. We need more open debate. I think if people thought stores were enacting these guidelines and orders on their own volition, and not at the threat of the state officials, they'd be more open to them. </p>
<p>As a person who handled the implementation of covid protections in a retail space, we did do it for our own protection. </p>
<p>We went further beyond what our city mandated we do. Our governor was limiting the power of the mayor, at the wish of the president.</p>
<p>Look up "shelly luther salon" to get an idea of the over reach our politicians had in my very city.</p>
<p>The threat of the state had nothing to do with it, the virus caused us to implement covid-19 safety protocols all on its own.</p>
<p>&rt;There is no middle ground and that is anti-private property and anti individual rights. If a store was openly against the guidelines and left alone these people would have a choice. </p>
<p>The free market did not save us from covid in any way.</p>
<p>Of course businesses would choose to stay open to survive in that circumstance. They would have to. The whole point of limiting business was to mitigate the spread of covid-19. </p>
<p>We now have over 350,000 deaths in the United States, and that's with the protocols we did that.</p>
<p>If we were simply left to our own devices, I shudder to think what that death number would be at this point.</p>
<p>If we would have just veered hard into the <em>other</em> direction, we could be back to normal by now like we all want to be.</p>

        <p>Fallacy - stating that masks stop viruses and make people safe. They don't, so there's the whole issue, no more reason to debate it. No one should be wearing masks, no one should harass anyone for not wearing a mask.<br>

        <p>&rt;You are correct it's the right of any store to deny service. Freedom 101.</p>
<p>There are specific instances that they can do this, not in the case where the customer's rights are protected by law...that would be discrimination and could result in lawsuit (but only if people know their rights). Funny how so many people DON'T know their rights, almost as if it's planned. Peggy Hall on youtube has more info.</p>

        <p>Then why doesn't anyone even try to do that?</p>
<p>Why, instead of attempting to use a curbside pickup option, would you choose to walk in to a store without a mask when you know that isnt welcome?</p>
<p>Why aren't people held to a certain level of personal responsibility? </p>
<p>They don't want to wear a mask? Fine. There are mechanisms in our society for them to get everything they need to survive, at no extra cost. They simply choose to not pursue those options.</p>

<p>Every big box retailer, restaurant and grocery store in my city offer some way for their goods to be delivered to your car.</p>
<p>Where do you live? </p>
<p>Just tell me the state.</p>
<p>I bet I could find 10 places in each of the 3 largest cities in your state that offer curbside grocery service.</p>
<p>And if you live in a small enough town that there are literally no chains at all, something like curbside pickup should be as simple as a phone call.</p>

        <p>But here's the kicker:</p>
<p>Do you really, honestly have a medical condition?</p>

<p>If you truly have a medical condition that makes it impossible for you to wear a mask, logic would say that you would be doing everything possible to avoid aggravating said medical condition. That would include avoiding respiratory illnesses like they were....you know...the plague.</p>
<p>If this really didn't matter to you, and you didn't care, you'd simply wear the mask.</p>
<p>However, this does really matter, and you do seem to really care about not wearing the mask.</p>

        <p>Yet it's a businesses right to establish and enforce a mask policy. Do you disagree?</p>
<p>I really don't believe you when you say that there is no curbside pick up in your area. In fact, I guarantee there is...which shows that your entire position is literally that you just don't like masks. Thats not a valid reason for them to not be worn. Thats also not a valid reason for anyone who isn't wearing a mask to violate a businesses right to establish and enforce a mask policy.</p>

<p>I also believe that you should be using the curbside pickup that is definitely 100% available in your area since you refuse to wear a mask. </p>
<p>You said you would do it. So do it.</p>

        <p>Ah, so they <em>do</em> offer curbside pick up in your area. You just chose to lie about that, and then ignore my line of questioning until this revealing point.</p>

        <p>So at the end of the day, you don't use curbside pick up because there aren't signs for it up at the physical store?</p>
<p>But you also don't use curbside pickup at the places where there are signs posted?</p>
<p>I absolutely, 100% guarantee there are retail spaces that you go to that advertise curbside pickup and you don't use it.</p>
<p>There's no way you haven't been to a single establishment that's advertised curbside pickup in the last 9 months.</p>

        <p>I also noticed that you dodged the question about being vaccinated.</p>
<p>You are vaccinated. You just don't want to answer, just like you didn't want to answer about curbside pick up being available in your area.</p>
<p>It sure does seem like you had a previously decided conviction, and you've decided to create a reality in which your previously decided conviction is "correct".</p>
<p>But in order for your previously held conviction to be "correct", you literally have to lie about having a medical condition and lie about curbside pick up not being available in your area. </p>
<p>(Or just have your entire argument be that you're a person who only does whatever they see in an advertisement that day. So since you don't literally see advertisements for curb side pick up you don't do it....that doesn't exactly scream "going against the norm" now does it?)</p>
<p>Honestly, after spending time on this sub, you anti-maskers are just some the most selfish people on the planet. Thats all it comes down to.</p>

        <p>I asked you about whether you <em>would</em> take the covid vaccine?</p>
<p>And if not, why not?</p>
<p>Also with the way you answered:</p>
<p>"Are you vaccinated at all?"</p>
<p>"For covid, no."</p>
<p>That let's me know you <em>are</em> vaccinated. </p>
<p>So by that logic you would take the covid 19 vaccine when it becomes available to you.</p>
<p>And no, I don't like the answer of "I only do what I see on the TV, if it ain't on the TV, I don't do it." It isnt a valid reason to violate store policy.</p>
<p>In America a business has the right to establish and enforce a mask policy.</p>
<p>You know deep down whether or not you truly have a medical condition that would make it impossible for you to wear a mask for a short store trip. There's nothing wrong with being disabled. It is, however, disgusting to pretend to be disabled to simply only get your own way.</p>
<p>Like I said. You know in your soul whether you're lying or not. That isn't my concern at all.</p>
<p>Whether you're disabled or not, you still don't have the right to enter a business that has a mask policy. You have specifically been catered to.</p>
<p>Since you're disabled, can't wear a mask, and refuse to protect yourself by using curbside pick up....you clearly aren't actually sick or disabled in any way that prevents wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Either that, or you should seek a therapist. Destructive behavior to the self isnt an indication of good mental health.</p>
<p>The entitlement is insane.</p>
<p>You're either lying, or are showing signs of expressing self harm. Either way, I hope you get the help you need to maintain being a safe and happy human without taking away others safety and happiness.</p>

        <p>So you're anti-vaccination in general even though you yourself are vaccinated?</p>
<p>Either you have breathing issues, which means you would be extremely careful of not getting covid.</p>

        <p>It has been my experience that anyone with a valid reason for not wearing a mask has been more than happy with either a reasonable accommodation from a business or providing evidence that they actually have the condition they claim. Anyone who trots out the phrase "I can't and don't have to wear one and you are not allowed to ask me to prove this" or something similar, has been a lying sack of shit plague rat who is making it more difficult for those that do have legitimate reasons.</p>

        <p>There is a ton of misinformation in this thread. </p>
<p>A store can absolutely deny you entry for refusing to wear a mask, however, they cannot deny you service for having a medical condition preventing you from wearing one. Service can mean something like having the same offerings in store provides through a curbside pickup option.</p>
<p>HIPAA applies to healthcare providers and individuals in the medical field.  You are not having your right violated if a store employee asks you about what medical condition you have that prevents you from wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>I read that mandates and laws hold the same power, the only difference is how it came to be. Perhaps that is wrong tho or I misunderstood something from it. Or do you mean that they hold the same power but a law should override a mandate regardless?</p>

        <p>I can only speak for my U.S. state and not other countries.</p>
<p>A law is brought to fruition in front of a body of lawmakers who debate and vote on the law. If the majority vote yes then the law is passed to the executive branch where it can either be signed as official law or vetoed which nullifies it. The executive can create law but it MUST be voted on by the legislature. If they vote no, it does not become law.</p>
<p>A mandate is a law of sorts that is issued by the executive of a state or country without a debating body being involved. Mandates are a necessary tool when declarations of emergency are declared. </p>
<p>For example, a state governor should not have to run evacuation orders through the state legislature during a forest fire or hurricane. There wouldn't be time and the governor needs to take immediate action in those cases.</p>
<p>In my state, per the state constitution the governor can only issue mandates for a 30 day period during a state of emergency before the legislature must be called into session by law. If the governor refuses to call the legislature into session they can call themselves into session and override the governor. The legislature in my state threatened to do this very thing about a month ago if the governor didn't quit enacting nonsensical mandates. He quit enacting them and repealed a bunch more.</p>
<p>Basically mandates should only be the equivalent of law for a maximum period of 30 days. After that they should expire and either be voted on by the legislative branch or dropped completely. </p>
<p>Mandates are supposed to be temporary while laws are permanent. Therefore, a law should override mandates after 30 days. Many of these "mandates" issued have gone far beyond the 30 days and never been voted on. That makes them illegal on two different fronts.</p>
<p>The very use of words like "mandate" and "orders" are more common in dictatorships where one individual or small group decrees them.</p>

        <p>They don't supercede. The original intent of mandates and orders was to help keep the population safe in times of emergency. Examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An invasion on U.S. soil would not require the President to get Congress's approval for retaliation. The president would "order" military intervention. Even those orders would be temporary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every year wildfires ravage the U.S. west. The governors of those states can "mandate" business closures and evacuations within the fires path. I think we all agree the governor shouldn't have to have an act of the state legislature to quickly evacuate people.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is that we now have governors stretching emergency declarations well beyond the 30 day limit. Also, they are bluring the lines with non-emergency orders such as mask mandate (I hate typing those words) and orders to close certain businesses and not others.</p>
<p>With legit closure orders during a wildfire or earthquake, ALL affected businesses, homes and dwellings are closed in the affected area. </p>
<p>With the current fiasco, some governors think they can mandate bars close at 10:00 while restaurants can stay open past that. Walmart can stay open while the small retailer must close. The spirit and intent of the emergency declaration laws have been lost.</p>

        <p>You clearly don't understand how HIPAA works. It applies to <strong>medical professionals</strong> and how they're allowed to share your medical information.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The HIPAA Privacy Rule set the standard for protecting sensitive patient data by creating regulations for the electronic exchange, privacy, and security of patient medical information by those in the health care industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>A store manager asking why you think you are exempt from a mask mandate doesn't violate HIPAA.</p>
<p>If you want to file an ADA claim, you need a doctor's note as to why you can't wear a mask. And you probably need to have the note BEFORE you get fined for refusing to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>Does this also apply to employers? I’d assume you are protected under HIPAA and the ADA at work as well. Sure they can let you go for pretty much any other reason but I’m curious if these things would protect you from specifically not wearing a mask at work even though it’s “policy.”</p>

        <p>But HIPAA only regulates the security of medical records. Any business can require shirt, shoes, and mask, but they can’t make you admit you have a disease. Also, there are no disabilities that prevent wearing a mask but still leave one capable of shopping, so it’s not an ADA issue.</p>

        <p>Any breathing condition that can’t pull through a mask can be covered by a face shield. Any psychological disability that prevents face covering can be served by delivery or curbside. It is not “the law” that a store has to let you inside maskless, only that they offer you alternative service.</p>

        <p>As other comments said, that is not how HIPAA works. I wish people would stop saying this. It makes you look dumb. HIPAA is basically, if I go to my doctor, get diagnosed with asthma preventing me from wearing a mask, the doctor can't tell anyone I have asthma. If I go to a pharmacy for my inhaler, and someone is harassing me for not wearing a mask, the pharmacist can't say "It's ok she's asthmatic." This doesn't make it illegal to question anything, ever. It may be considered a violation of ADA, but there are exceptions made there of course, such as asking certain questions about service animals. Point is, no you can't just say "I HaVe A dIsABiLiTy" and do whatever you want, no questions asked.</p>

        <p>Can a business legally prevent me from entering if I am not wearing a face covering?</p>
<p>Yes. Under the governor’s order businesses are not allowed to provide service to people without face coverings. Businesses are encouraged to offer other accommodations, such as curbside service or delivery, but they now must require face coverings for anyone who wants to enter.</p>
<p>Are businesses required to enforce the order for the public to wear face coverings?</p>
<p>Yes. Businesses must require customers to wear face coverings to enter their establishments and receive service. If a customer refuses to wear a mask or leave the premises, businesses should offer alternative service options, like curbside service, but if a customer still refuses to wear a mask, businesses should follow their normal procedures for dealing with challenging customers, which might include contacting local law enforcement for help.</p>

<p>And </p>
<p>"You are not required to provide proof of any condition that qualifies you for an exemption. It’s important for people to be supportive and tolerant of one another during this pandemic"</p>
<p>Businesses being "encouraged" is a far stretch from them being  required to do so they are also aloud to... just let you to shop, I have already stated several times yes if a business says if you cant wear a mask we do curb side pick ups then that is ok </p>
<p>&rt;Are businesses required to enforce the order for the public to wear face coverings?</p>
<p>So all that being said no ..no they are not "required" to do so, they are "encouraged"  to do so. But because there are medical exemptions and some businesses dont have the staff or time to do curb side pick up and maintain normal flow of business they are also aloud to just let you shop</p>

<h1>Yes</h1>

<p>Ok? </p>
<p>Merely asking “do you have a medical exemption?” is neither: </p>
<p>1)asking for proof
2)asking for details </p>
<p>please explain what businesses that don’t “have staff or time to do curbside pickups” could possibly be considered essential services that are protected civil rights?</p>
<p>A hobby store that sells model trains? If they denied someone service have they violated their essential civil rights?</p>
<p>Can I take a shit on the floor in the produce aisle at my grocery store and claim that i have a medical condition which allows me to do whatever the fuck I want? </p>
<p>And by the way, the correct homonyn that you have misused multiple times is ‘allowed,’ not ‘aloud.’</p>

<p>You seriously are lacking in your reading comprehension. </p>
<p>They are REQUIRED to bar entry from customers not wearing masks.</p>
<p>They are ENCOURAGED to offer other means to shop. </p>
<p>The encouragement to provide <em>other</em> means to shop doesn’t somehow negate the requirement to ban entry.</p>
<p>Option A is required
Providing options b, c, d, etc are encouraged but option A can only be used if the requirement is followed.</p>
<p>“We require that you do not smoke inside the building, however, if you choose to smoke, we encourage you to use our outdoor smoking patio.”</p>
<p>But somehow you would interpret that as they can just ‘let you’ smoke inside</p>

        <p>&rt; 1: it goes against the HIPAA to ask someone to wear one publicly, Because they now have to disclose they have a medical condition to defend them self's</p>
<p>Merely stating that you suffer from an undisclosed medical condition does not violate HIPAA. If you are unable to wear a mask, businesses need to provide alternative accommodations. If you have a peanut allergy, you can’t go to a Jif factory for a tour and demand they remove all peanuts from the building to accommodate you.</p>

        <p>You’re so wrong that it physically hurt me to actually read your comment in it’s entirety. </p>
<p>It doesn’t go against any HIPAA code to ask someone to wear a mask publicly at all. Same reason you can tell people to put on a shirt or shoes. </p>
<p>Also the only disability that could even require a mask exemption would be a patient with an advanced lung condition so severe, they need extra oxygen. </p>
<p>So unless you are LITERALLY walking around with a tank of oxygen attached to yourself then you can wear a mask. If you get told to put a mask on and you are on oxygen then I 100% agree you should be exempt, however, you should also stay home because those are the people who would die from the same disease they are “fighting” against.</p>

        <p>HIPAA only applies to covered entities, not everyone is bound by HIPAA. I'm not super informed about ADA though, got a source on that?</p>
<p>Bottom line though, if a store can deny service if you don't wear shoes, they can deny if you don't wear a mask. </p>
<p>P.S. I have asthma and wear a mask 8 ½ hours a day at work with no difficulty. Unless you're having an asthma attack, there's no excuse. My dad has COPD and wears a mask in public with no difficulty. I'm my opinion, there's no excuse. Of course this is anecdotal evidence so ymmv, but literally no body is going to be hurt from wearing a mask for 30 min while in the grocery store. People just need to grow up and instead of worrying about a new normal, do the right things so we can go back to the old normal.</p>

        <p>I love the videos of you dumb asses being dragged outta stores by cops spewing this bs. 
1. There is no medical examination for masks. If you have breathing troubles you need a mask even more 
2. Masks don’t make it harder to breath, if it did there would be some affect of blood o2 levels then correct? 
3. Stores are private property they can ban you for what ever reason they see fit, just the same as you’re aloud to tell someone to get off your property. I really would think this group of people would understand this considering they’re penises are so small they have to carry 6 guns everywhere with them just in case a black person walks in to the Walmart. 
4. There are already states/cities where you can’t send your child to public school with out vaccine records you fucking idiot. </p>
<p>Do you guys just make shit up yell in to a cave listen for the eco and repeat? Is that where you get your info? Y’all are a weak ass group of people. You do realize the government makes you wear clothes right? You realizes you can’t enter a store with you your penis/vagina/nipples showing right? What’s the difference for your nose 😂</p>
<p>Also 100% aware imma bout to be banned for breaking your eco chamber. Piece bitches 🖕</p>

        <p>&rt; 1. There is no medical examination for masks</p>
<p>This alone shows how little you know, if you check most "mandates" have a section about Medical exemptions </p>
<p>&rt;2. Masks don’t make it harder to breath, if it did there would be some affect of blood o2 levels then correct?</p>
<p>Again I point to the medical exemptions in mask mandates, and why they say that under 2 are also exempt, if they dont impend your breathing then why would they have them exemptions?</p>
<p>&rt; 3. Stores are private property they can ban you for what ever reason they see fit</p>
<p>while true they still need a reason and "because you cant wear a mask" is not acceptable </p>
<p>&rt;Do you guys just make shit up yell in to a cave listen for the eco and repeat?</p>
<p>Sounds like that is what you are doing to me </p>
<p>&rt; What’s the difference for your nose</p>

        <p>So no real legal reasoning then, just a whiny plague rat who wants to be selfish and parrots what he has heard from some idiot anti-masker folks. Good to know. Pretty sure I acknowledged that there are legit conditions. Not sure how a little mask is going to stop you from breathing, and if you had a legitimate medical condition that would make it so, I am sure you would be more than happy to inform us, at least that is what every single person I know of that has actual conditions that make it so they cannot wear a mask has done. All of which would be happy to provide proof or accept a reasonable accommodation such as curbside pickup - I am sure even if a business has not advertised that this is an option, calling them will more than likely have them be happy to arrange (unless they too are idiot ant-maskers). It has been my experience that anyone claiming to not be able to wear mask followed by "and you can't ask me to provide proof hurr durr" or some such have, 100% of the time, been absolute fucking liars and are making it more difficult for those who have legitimate conditions as well as those working and shopping in any particular establishment.</p>

        <p>Masks do stop the droplets that viruses need to travel on and have zero risk to the average wearer outside of those with the aforementioned actual conditions. A LOT OF BENEFIT FOR VERY LITTLE RISK. Looks like you have been woefully misinformed and should probably start getting your info from more credible sources rather than from conspiracy nutters whose track record of intellectual honesty does not exist eh. Fauci would be acceptable if you did not take a 45 second snippet completely out of context of course. Either way, wear a mask or not but don't expect your specious legal angle to keep you from any consequences should you be denied service fined etc. Have fun with the other plague rats in your echo chambers of fractal wrongness eh.</p>

<p>No, it isn't lmfao. I'm not implying anything. You made a specific, supposedly easily provable and tangible claim, and I'm asking you something very specific to back it up; I want to know what part of the US or state laws prevent legislation from being passed concerning facial covering. It's not rhetorical. I want to know where you got that information. </p>

        <p>At least in some states, covering the face is against religious beliefs also. Another reason for discrimination. Store policy does not supercede our civil rights. Doesn't matter how much people whine about someone being selfish, doesn't change those laws. Peggy Hall on youtube for more info on this.<br>
And people aren't even being selfish, WHEN YOU KNOW MASKS DON'T STOP VIRUSES BUT CAN ONLY CAUSE HARM TO THE WEARER. <br>
Get educated and stop being gullible, stop hurting yourselves, too. <br>

        <p>That’s a load of shit. If you walk into any store without a mask that’s an easy arrest. They can require you to wear a shirt and shoes so they can also require a mask. Private owned stores can allow whoever they want and ban whoever they want. Get bent</p>

<p>"An easy arrest" LMAO they are letting people out of jail because of covid I live in America 
I have not worn a mask at all this whole time, I walk in to stores all the time that "require mask" the most that has happened is this scenario </p>
<p>Them: You need to wear a mask 
Me: I have a medical condition
Them: Sorry for bothering you </p>
<p>&rt;They can require you to wear a shirt and shoes so they can also require a mask</p>
<p>you all love this false equivalence shirts and shoes dont restrict breathing  mask do they are not the same</p>
<p>&rt;Private owned stores can allow whoever they want and ban whoever they want. </p>
<p>They still need reasons its not as black and white as you seem to think it is</p>

        <p>If you are protesting against the lockdowns while being part of the reason lockdowns become necessary by not following public health mandates, then I would hazard a guess that you are not very knowledgeable about a great many things.</p>

        <p>Like the fact that all of Europe has been under essentially martial law and they still have rising cases because masks and lockdowns work soooo well and therefore won't release lockdown 10 months later? Sounds like paradise for smart people like you.</p>

        <p>Well they certainly work in areas that do not have a high number of fucksticks who flout the rules by not wearing masks, not social distancing etc. If folks actually follow the mask\social distancing etc, no need for lockdowns. Seem to be doing quite well where I am at because most of us understand this concept. The places in my country with high numbers of cases also have the highest numbers of non compliant folks. Almost like the lockdowns are exactly the fault of those protesting the lockdowns. You people are stupid as fuck lol</p>

        <p>Source please that lockdowns lower death rates. I’ve been doing this for nearly a year, they don’t.</p>
<p>It’s very easy to repeat unsourced shit from the TV. If you are coming here to debate you better make damn sure you have some shit to back it up because we actually know how to think here.</p>
<p>Would you stay in your home forever for a disease with a 99.97 survival rate if daddy gov said so? Like do you even have a line where enough is enough or you’ll just take it in the ass indefinitely? I’m curious.</p>

        <p>I’d like you to look at the graph of covid cases in nyc compared to lock down start/end. You can’t miss it even being as stupid as you are. You guys are so fucking stupid people are dying of strokes in hospital hallways while covid patience fill the hospitals because you think this infringes on your “rights”. Covid death rates are fairly low if you can get medical help. Regardless of how pointlessly deep state stupid you are you must realize if there are an extra 10000 people in a hospital it’s not going to be able to care for everyone which will lead to more and more deaths from not only covid but from other things like car crashes and brain aneurisms because they’re no hospital beds to care for these people</p>

        <p>Dude there is 0 convo to be had about masks. Either you understand the grade 2 science or you don’t. If you cover your spit hole it’s harder for spit to get spit in your friends mouth/nose/eyes/ears. Which is why 2 masks are better then one (in a room with 2 people). Let me simplify this for you, it’s like covering your mouth when you cough but the long game. That make sense to you? I could send you a voice message if your text to voice isn’t clear.

        <p>Look, I know you just are a person that cares about the well being for others, we all do. The purpose of a mask is to stop spreading the virus if you already have it. It doesn’t do much to protect you from it. </p>
<p>There were some theories that covid was scarier than most disease’s because we though people could be infected without showing symptoms and then spread it to people who would fall into the fatal category. This has turned out to be not true. </p>
<p>Most of the deaths that occurred from covid 19 were from 4 mayors that stuffed confirmed cases into nursing homes - killing large segments of the population. It’s literally murder.</p>
<p>The common person walking around is not a danger to you. And if you truly care about the well being of the people around you, don’t you understand how lockdowns are doing more harm than good? We are fighting for you, not against you</p>

        <p>Bruh. On your profile you’re growing weed. Authoritarianism made weed illegal and you would have ended up in jail a few years ago or if you were living in a state where weed wasn’t legal. They argued that banning weed was for public health and safety. Now why would you want to bring that authoritarianism on?</p>

        <p>There’s a difference between the government deliberately lying about marijuana to justify their crack down on hippies and black and brown people, and the government advising us to wear masks because scientists and experts have proven that it reduces the chances of spreading a potentially life-threatening virus to the people around you. There’s literally no harm in wearing a mask or being politely asked to wear one. Peoples lives have been ruined and hundreds of thousands of people are still in prison for the lies that the government spread about marijuana. This is such a bad analogy.</p>

        <p>That’s why I specifically said <em>endangering their child’s life</em>, I’m not talking about arresting someone for smoking weed, just like I’m not talking about fining someone for not wearing a mask on their balcony or in a park where they’re far from other people. I’m referring to the people who smoke weed in the room with their child and are basically forcing them to inhale their second hand smoke, or the people who refuse to wear their mask when they’re indoors and in close proximity to others who they could potentially spread a fatal virus to.</p>

<p>One could argue that marijuana is a public health threat, hence the ban. In the past, the argument was that a) it’s a gateway drug b) it slows people down and makes them more prone to bad decisions and c) that they could sell it to others and make them addicted.</p>

1. People are not going to use them correctly, they will touch they’re mask/ face rendering it useless 
2. Doctors/nurses need them, I understand it’s hard for you to retain information but 8 months ago there was a world wide mask shortage and directors and nurses couldn’t get them.</p>
<p>I get it’s hard for stupid people to understand this but people who are actually smart change there opinions. They change with new information, they change with new circumstances just like he did. When there were extra masks he told people to use them and to use them properly. The mental gymnastics holy fuck</p>

People don't wear masks, spread is not hindered, hospitals are overwhelmed and we have 300k+ fatalities. But hey, the hospitals got their masks right?!?

        <p>Dude has a total shit track record. He was still trying to convince people that AIDS was airborne during that pandemic when a huge body of evidence had already risen that AIDS is contracted thru the exchange of bodily fluids. This man leans on fear to stay in the spotlight and maintain power. There isn't any reason why we should trust him and the institution he represents.</p>

        <p>They were advising against the use of masks because there was a global shortage and healthcare workers couldn’t get them, not because they were ineffective. Since then, they’ve been encouraging everyone to wear masks as it can reduce chances of spread by up to 90% if both people are using them. Surgeons and medical personnel have been using masks to prevent spreading illnesses to their patients for decades, masks aren’t some new idea.</p>

        <p>I know damn well what they were doing, what your trying to say is they were lying about the effectiveness of masks to the public so the health care workers could have their essential ppe without shortages. </p>
<p>The problem is the fact that he didn't mention this at all and instead downright lied about it to the public. How you can take the word of a man that does that is beyond me.</p>

        <p>Yes, it is the small minority of people not wearing masks to blame for all this. Let's not bother to think about the fact wearing bandanas, neck gaiters and masks of the homemade variety, all of which will assuredly do nothing, are entirely acceptable. Let's also not bother to think about the fact covid isnt just in the water droplets you emit while breathing and talking, but also in the aerosols that you emit while breathing and talking, thus assuring that cloth masks and surgical masks are also doing nothing. Let's also entirely ignore the fact that California, which has 100% mask compliance indoors and near 100% mask compliance outdoors now too, is currently the state with the most covid cases. </p>
<p>But fuck me right? I'm just an anti mask asshole, right? Why bother with anything I have to say? We need to trust the experts! And the science! Oh, look at this, Michael Osterholm, one of Joe Biden's picks for his covid taskforce talking about how cloth and surgical masks only provide the illusion of saftey and that only an n95 will protect anyone: https://youtu.be/HnkSs1MWEHI</p>

        <p>I'm curious... do you argue the No Shirt No Shoes No Service argument when shopping/venturing out? I guess what I'm trying understand, is how exactly is wearing a piece of cloth on your body and different from wearing a piece of cloth on your body? No one is protesting that they can't walk into a restaurant topless. Thats not a law that's broken (if a man does it), but try walking into a 4 star restaurant with no shoes, or even in jeans and a t-shirt.  Why are your panties not in a bunch over that? Its the same concept, just less, ya know, potentially deadly for others.. Wear appropriate attire, or leave. 
You know what, go to the Trump Hotel in a bathing suit  and flipflops, and see if you aren't asked to either comply with the dress code, or leave.  Again... same concept... just not potentially deadly to those around you.</p>

        <p>Zero people are dying because I don’t wear a mask. The 1% that are dying, would have probably died had they gotten a cold or the flu. Yes, there are the very few who unexpectedly died and thats obviously terrible. Is this reason enough to lock down EVERYONE in the world and ruin their lives? Their finances? Lose their jobs and livelihoods? Not even close. I feel for those that die and their families in the same way I feel for those who die of the flu and their families, or those who die in car accidents, etc. I will not, however, sacrifice the people I love for them.</p>

<li>
<p>You can't possibly know if you're asymptomatic unless you're tested... meaning you have no idea if you passed /are passing the virus to someone... and whether coming in contact with you got them ill/killed them. That's why they contact tracing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its not just about the death rate. The more we learn about this novel virus, the more we see that there are long term health effects that are directly related to it- even if the person was not "knocking on deaths door."
You are not understanding that it is more transmitable than the flu, and has longer lasting effects. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saying "I'll protect my family and screw everyone else" is exactly why we are still in this mess.  Everyone has to work together. I can't teach you why its important to care about others... you should have learned empathy and compassion before 1st grade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your rights end where mine begin. In other words, I have the right to have a reasonable expectation that I can go to the store without someone trying to actively kill me.  As I said above, you don't protest NoShirtNoShoesNoService... this piece of cloth is no different from a shirt... except that it can save a life - which, is actually a pretty big deal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More people are dying per day from this pandemic than died on 9-11.  Where you outraged on 9-11-01? I sure as hell was. Flight 93 nearly landed on my grandmother's HOUSE. (I Digress.) Yet there are STILL people walking around without a mask- which at this point is basically saying "Eff you, I don't care if you get sick /die" to everyone in your community. (See number 3.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a GLOBAL problem, yet the USA - for all its glory and shine- seems to be handling this as though we are a third world country with no communication or health care... or common sense. If everyone would just STOP... breathe... think of your neighbor, your sister, the kid down the block... and FREEZE... we could have been through this already.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As long as there are people insitisting that "no! Wah! Muh rights!" instead of considering others' rights too, this pandemic WILL. NOT. GO. AWAY.  Its like a little kid throwing a tantrum... he can get out of timeout as long as he sits quietly for 4 mins... but he won't, and so 10 minutes later, he's still there. Except we're adults, and people are dying because there are people who refuse to try to understand BASIC SCIENCE or PERSONAL HYGIENE. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The government dropped the ball on this entire thing, turning it into a shit show.  You can't ask business to shutdown and then not supplement their income/ livelihood with $1800 for 10 months of living.  The stimulus checks that went out in March should have been 5-8x what they were, but millionaire corporations got their cut first... and "Eff the American people."  I digress, again... this is not the topic at hand. I could give a list of how the government could have managed this pandemic better- starting with NOT letting ANYONE into the country without quarantine, regardless of citizenship.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It doesn't NEED to be this way. But if its going to come to an end, we need to work TOGETHER... As a COMMUNITY, and lose the "I got mine, screw you attitude." All Lives Matter, right?? Prove it.</p>

        <p>No, I don't argue the other policies, as they don't ENDANGER MY OWN HEALTH the same way wearing a mask does. Wearing a mask is all risk and zero benefit. I'm going to provide some proof here, from the top experts on the subject of masks. NO ONE ELSE knows more than they do. Yes, it's an hour long, there's a lot of facts on the subject, probably more they could have shared if they had the time. <br>

        <p>I need someone like this in the EU as I've been fined €2,160 for taking too long transiting through Croatia (15hrs against a window of 12hrs) despite the covid restrictions not actually being law, and despite nobody at the entry border telling us anything about the time restriction.</p>
<p>We were passing through in a campervan, followed every rule and restriction to the letter and to the spirit, and aside from stepping out to refuel the van we didn't get step foot in Croatia.</p>
<p>Croatia have been in a lot of hot water of late for humanitarian abuses against migrants, (we're not migrants but EU citizens) so I'm not looking forwards to the fight.</p>

        <p>Serious question, i dont want a fight or some shit. whats the problem with wearing a mask? if you have actual breathing problems then i get it, but there are a lot of people that just don’t like to wear one even tho they have good lungs. Heck, i even know some people with heavy astma that can wear one.</p>

        <p>Yes they have. Wearing a cloth mask over your face for extended periods of time will eventually lead to the development of the body needing C02. This is a form of COPD. Once developed, it cannot be cured and the worst consequence is patients with this form of COPD cannot accept 02 therapy. Heavily limiting their medical intervention options when needed.

        <p>Yes, wearing those things CAN harm people, and do. Apparently you either didn't watch the video I linked from THE TOP PEOPLE on the subject, or you're ignoring the facts they provide. Either way, you're ignorant (ignoring truth).<br>

        <p>They do lower your SP02 by about 2-3% on average. The avg SP02 is about 97-98% in healthy adults. Emergency medicine practitioners determined long ago that an SP02 of 94% and lower requires supplemental 02 to support proper perfusion. You want to talk about medical facts?

        <p>I teach medicine and have practiced it for years. Every new class I pick up, I teach them about PPE and have a special segment just for how useless cloth masks are. Their minds are always blown and they feel cheated when I show them the ACTUAL science. Not the non-peer reviewed nonsense put out by the media. CLOTH masks do nothing but catch large droplets from the nose and mouth, and not even all of them due to vents on both sides of the nose and mouth. N-95 masks that are fitted properly for the user, however, do actually work. The media has people wear cloth masks because its expensive to make N-95 masks and they are not effectively reusable. Funny how someone that probably lives in their mothers basement feels they can call someone like me a moron while citing no sources except what their echo chamber says or CNN. If you want to have a real discussion and find a real answer, which you likely have no interest in, you can PM me and we can chat.</p>

        <p>I humored you anyways and reviewed your sources. First of all, the first link was a study done on N-95 masks. You either did not read it yourself, or hoped I would not see that and tried to pass the study off as if it were about the effectiveness of cloth masks. Shame on you. The second link took me to an open source website. Meaning, its not peer reviewed, its the equivalent of wikipedia. Any more brain busters?</p>

<p>Plenty there proving you wrong mate. In fact the only detriment to wearing masks is the risk of people no adhering to social distancing too. Masks work, you aren’t a doctor, there are plenty of studies that support this. 
Would you provide evidence they don’t work or would you like to continue playing internet doctor?</p>

<p>No your opinion has no more weight than mine. Surely someone in the field of medicine would know how diverse the field is? A GP has no opinions on the spread of respiratory viruses cause they don’t study it. A surgeons opinion isn’t worth taking... they don’t study it.

        <p>What are you talking about? Also, N-95 is not a respirator lmfao. The only person making a fool of themselves is you. Calling me names and pretending like you know anything about me. Rather than citing sources talking about cloth masks all you can do is cite sources about N-95s or refer me to open-source websites editable by anyone with a keyboard. I stead of providing the evidence you claimed to have, you instead spent your time trying, and failing, to defame me by looking in what? My comment history? Lmfao. Yes, my opinion absolutely holds more weight than yours. You don’t have to be an epidemiologist to know how a cloth mask works versus an N-95 mask. Just like how you don’t have to be a mathematician to know your times tables.</p>

        <p>Idiot. The surgical N95 respirator. That’s what it is lol you are so plebeian you can’t read for 2 mins and know that the N95 is a respirator mask lol</p>
<p>I’ve also cited many sources. Oxford university’s study being one of them. Many scientific studies from around the world. You clearly haven’t read even the abstract of any of them!</p>
<p>And yeah I used your comment history from 20 days ago to prove you are just some idiot on the internet, lying about their credentials and spreading misinformation. Just to get this straight, you were a firefighter 21 days ago and now you are a professor of medicine? Lol stop embarrassing yourself. At least try keep your story straight. </p>
<p>Again I’ll point you to the fact that some medical professionals knew very little about the spread of respiratory diseases before this... cause they didn’t deal with them... as a “professor of medicine” you must know how incredibly diverse the field is. (I think, correct me if I’m wrong, but that’s why people have listened to the specialists in these areas... hmmmm) the studies ALL suggest masks work, be they the N95 or not, and to varying degrees. You are just a silly little fireman on the internet playing doctor.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t a fireman 21 days ago wtf are you talking about? You keep saying that like its going to make it any more true. Diving through my comment history shows me two things, 1. You don’t have an argument and need to try and defame me. 2. You don’t have a life and clearly think that comment histories determine what I do real time. I was a firefighter before that much is true, definitely not 21 days ago LMFAO. Yeah, every study you cited was about N-95s. Idk why you keep beating around that. Cloth masks don’t work. Yes im a professor of emergency medicine now and was a firefighter before. Idk how you think that makes me less qualified to talk about how cloth masks don’t work. Part of being a firefighter was being a HAZMAT technician where I got in depth education and experience with different types of PPE. Ive worked emergency rooms and emergency scenes probably before you were done sucking your moms tits. Also, yes, obviously N-95s work thats irrefutable. Cloth masks do not. Theres zero evidence supporting that they do. No amount of open source websites, name calling, failed defamation, and immaturity is going to change that. This is my last comment to you, as you obviously don’t care about the truth, just what confirms your bias.</p>

<p>This picture may help you understand what the studies mean when they say mask and respirator lol </p>
<p>I’m not trying “defame you” as much as I’m calling out your lies. You, 21 days ago, said “I’m a firefighter” and that you are “a jack of all trades, master of none” your words not mine. So we’re you lying then or now? Can you see how things you have said have made your status as a medical professor pretty dubious? </p>
<p>Almost every single source I’ve cited talks about masks and respirators. One is loose fitting and one is tight fitting. Both work, one better than the other. Try actually reading. In fact, most of them also cite hundreds of other studies.</p>
<p>You are massively wrong lol I have provided masses of evidence by scientists who are all credible. You on the other hand say they are wrong.... and you have never studied the spread of respiratory diseases lol why would you have? Emergency medicine has nothing to do with the spread of viruses. They couldn’t be further apart. As a professional I would have though you would know the difference between masks and you would take more than 30 seconds to look at a study. All of which prove you wrong, most of which are studied against more than one type of mask (respirator N95 and surgical loose fitting)</p>
<p>You sir, are a fool spreading lies on the internet, telling people that you are what you aren’t.</p>

        <p>First, it's TWO of the women in the video who are the top authorities on masks and know more than anyone else.<br>
Second, they are not in fear of losing their jobs, so they can speak TRUTH.<br>
Third, you want to claim that numbers of people are important? THOUSANDS of doctors and other medical professionals are against masks and the other illogical policies that have been implemented.</p>
<p>As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies, and recommend an approach we call Focused Protection.</p>

        <p>My husband and I would still rather not risk it. Call us cowards if you want, but after months of not masking up because nowhere in our town was really enforcing it, we wear our bandanas in stores now. Almost a year without a problem, then Walmart's new security chases us through the store demanding we mask up. It seems Brosnan is more aggressive than Allied. I thought they might actually assault me, or worse, assault my husband. We can't afford any legal or medical issues right now, we can't afford to boycott or be banned from every store in town, so fucking fine. We'll mask up. Not those stupid blue surgical masks though, or any other earloop masks, only bandanas and the like. Just a little something to blend in a bit more with the masses, at least until we've saved up some money and moved out to the countryside.</p>

        <p>Not as much harm as what any legal trouble could do to us. It's a calculated risk we're willing to take. Not like we go to the store very often. And I don't have time or patience to watch a YouTube video. Reading a transcript would be faster.</p>

        <p>I can't wrap my head around why anyone would want to listen to someone yammer on for however long when they could read the same material at their own pace. And going to court would be more detrimental to us in the long run, as we prioritize keeping our heads down until we're more socioeconomically secure over making some kind of futile stand in a corrupt legal system. What we see today didn't begin with COVID and won't end with COVID. If wearing a bandana over our air holes for an hour every week or so keeps us from being fined, assaulted, imprisoned, etc regardless of your little laws or lack thereof, so be it. There isn't one right way to go about this, that kind of mindset is what got us into this mess to begin with.</p>

        <p>&rt; A law and a mandate have the same power to be enforced. The only difference is how it came to be. </p>
<p>&rt;A law is passed by the senate and the house of representatives and signed by the governor. A mandate is made by the governor, with the power given to them by the legislature in a state of emergency. </p>

        <p>There’s no mask mandate in Florida, but shops do have the right to deny service if they require a mask. If you refuse to leave or mask up then you’re trespassing and police will be notified. How you choose to behave with the police at that point is what determines whether you’ll be arrested or ticketed. </p>
<p>If you do what the cops ask then you have nothing to worry about..... right???</p>

        <p>Except masks actually <em>can</em> reduce the spread of Covid greatly. That is a scientific fact. Also notice how you said "bad flu seasons have killed over 100.000 people," without acknowledging the damage Covid is doing is incredibly more severe.</p>
<p>I haven't killed any grandmas, for I haven't explicitly gone against science because I'm insecure, like you're doing.</p>
<p>Besides, clothes are by far a necessary tool to survive for our entire existence. Sure, it would be incredibly unhygienic to not wear clothes, but it is definitely NOT AT ALL a necessity for our existence. So. Are you against clothes, too?</p>

        <p>The change is the we are already doing everything we can against the flu. The has been a vaccine out for fucking ages, too. Covid, on the other hand, was a newly surfacing virus we knew nothing about, hadn't prepared for, and knew no properties of. If you don't understand how the unknown has way bigger capability to inflict damage, then you're a fool.</p>
<p>You realise Covid has been compared to cancer by doctors, right? Imagine if cancer could spread through the air as easily as Covid does. "Well we had the flu, so why are we worrying about cancer??"</p>
<p>When you grow up past the mental age of 5, you'll probably realise that we can have more than one problem, and the flu is infinitely lower of a problem than Covid. You can reduce your risk of spreading Covid significantly. You choose not to. You can't with the flu.</p>
<p>This is why Covid is still active. It preys on stupidity from people like you who deny science. People like you are why America is struggling as the pathetic little baby it is.</p>
<p>Edit: AHHAHAHA YOU WENT ON REDDIT TO ASK FOR DEATH NUMBERS UNDER 1% BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS ARE SMARTER THAN YOU AHAHAHA. Listen, you're evidently a kid. Hopefully, rather. If the experts say you're wrong, and you need to turn to fucking Reddit of all places to find sources supporting your argument (AHAHAHA), YOU'RE CLEARLY FUCKING WRONG AHAHHA</p>

<p>1.) we were not doing everything against the flu. We have a vaccine, it is not mandatory. Schools were open, indoor dining was open, there was no limit on crowd size or gatherings, no mandating of masks, no working from home, no limit on attendance for concerts and sporting events, bars were open, we weren’t social distancing. What you said was just plain wrong.</p>
<ol>
<li>I appreciate the originality of that argument, but COVID is literally the farthest thing from cancer. </li>
</ol>
<p>Survival Rates for Cancer (five and ten years)</p>
<p>All Cancers 71.1%   52%
Oral cancer 60% 50%
Lip cancer  91% 89%
Hypopharynx cancer  33% 18%
Heart cancer    10% 1%
Esophageal cancer   19% 15%
Stomach cancer  30.6%   28%
Small intestine cancer  67.5%   63%
Colorectal cancer   64.9%   59%
Liver and bile duct cancer  22% 17%
Gallbladder cancer  18.2%   9%
Pancreatic cancer (all types)   8.2%    2.2%
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor 61% 50%
Laryngeal cancer    60.7%   60%
Lung cancer (all types) 18.1%   7%
Mesothelioma    9%  3%
Tracheal (Windpipe) cancer  52.9%   50%
Bone cancer (all types) 67.7%   56%
Soft tissue, not otherwise specified    64.4%   62%
Skin cancer (excluding basal and squamous)  91.7%   90%
Breast cancer   89.7%   81%</p>
<p>Covid, even if you use the CFR (IFR is a better measurement) has over a  97% survival rate, nothing close to what cancer is. I don’t even know why you tried that argument </p>

        <p>No I don’t walk around naked, D+ troll attempt on that one, but again, clothes have been worn by humans as a means to survive for hundreds of thousands of years, masks every time you leave the house has been a thing for a few months. I could use the clothes logic to justify literally anything. Why don’t we mandate all wearing hazmat suits, after all we mandate clothes!

        <p>Ah, so you're just afraid of change. It's only because that's "how it's always been."</p>
<p>Besides, you're saying you wear clothes because it helps humans survive... So do masks. That's literally their entire purpose, so I guess you just proved your stupidity LMAO</p>
<p>&rt;Why don't we mandate all wearing hazmat suits, after all we mandate clothes! See, it sounds ridiculous and is a terrible argument that doesn't make much sense.</p>
<p>Once again hilariously displaying your ignorance. Masks work. We don't need hazmat suits. Literally the only thing we need is a small piece of fabric on your face that you can fit in your pocket. Notice how you had to go to an absolute extreme to prove your point? That should be a quite clear indication of how stupid you are AHAHAH, just wear a fucking mask and stop whining like a baby. Are you gonna cry too? Awe, are you sad we won't allow you to kill people?</p>
<p>You're the kind who claims themselves to love your country, yet you're literally killing the people there ahahaha.</p>
<p>If you comply with clothes but don't comply with masks; you're brainwashed AHAHHA</p>

        <p>No they don't. Masks are only worn during surgery to prevent the doctor from accidentally getting saliva or another forgien object into his patient.  Does she also wear a biological suit, cause theres nothing stopping the virus from getting on her clothes,  shoes, skin, etc.?</p>

        <p>Not wearing them when it is appropriate to is what does. There is a lot of anti mask shit going around and I agree it shouldn't be a fineable offense I see no problem charging people for negligible homicide if someone dies from covid when it can be directly traced to when, where and who was responsible. The fucking idiot part refers to those who use facebook memes as science and believe they are losing rights being asked to wear a mask. Yeah I might have come off in a brash way but holy fuck as someone who works retail I have had enough of these morons.</p>

        <p>Let me make it simple then.</p>
<p>Air is made of particles and compounds of molecules.</p>
<p>These things can carry smaller particles and proteins.</p>
<p>Mask partially blocks the larger particles or divert them away from direct airflows or inhalation. </p>
<p>In a space of 2 meters or 6 feet, the particles are not directed to whom you are facing but directed away from and to your sides.</p>
<p>In limited contact scenarios that are often not practiced, this will severely hamper ANY virus or germ from being transmitted from person to person. </p>
<p>Why do flu patients wear masks. Why do surgeons wear masks. Why do people in heavily polluted areas wear masks. Why are masks even a thing. Why are some countries that mandated masks and lockdowns doing better than those that didnt and fought against the process. </p>
<p>We would all be better off if we just collectively decided to work in the best direction we have to go in, rather than fighting it and making it worse for everyone. </p>
<p>If wearing a mask is the best option for my health, my mothers health, my SOs health, I will wear one, whether or not there is irrefutable evidence for it. </p>
<p>Hospitals running out of ventilators and beds isnt enough of a sign I guess, neither is people dying from it. If wearing a mask can curb that by only a fraction it's still worth it. </p>
<p>But I havent given you a hyperlink or any kind of source you can pick thru so I'm sure this still isnt good enough. An actual epidemiologist cant change people's mind so I doubt I can.</p>

<p>Well, the evidence for wearing one now is to help mitigate the spread of the pandemic. We weren't in a pandemic before, so no, you didn't have to wear a mask.</p>

<p>You're not a "fucking idiot" for not knowing this information. However, you should definitely make an effort to read these studies and come to your own conclusions.</p>

        <p>The evidence we have isn’t enough to prove that non-medical masks, the kind which people buy from the store and are most commonly work, are effective at anything. There is only one randomizes control study testing the effectiveness of face masks vs no face masks against Covid , which was done in Denmark, and this Danish study showed no difference between the two. Every other study doesn’t control all the variables, so they include hand washing and anti social distance as variables for the masked side.

<p>I agree fully. Unfortunately the stylish cloth masks most people started wearing in the summer were not good enough.</p>
<p>I realized this many months ago whilst looking over a ton of studies done by different organizations. I came to the conclusion, again using their data, that medical masks are more efficient at reducing the spread of covid 19 over not wearing a mask at all.</p>
<p>&rt;There is only one randomizes control study testing the effectiveness of face masks vs no face masks against Covid , which was done in Denmark, and this Danish study showed no difference between the two.</p>
<p>Which Danish study are you referring to?</p>
<p>I found this one:</p>
<p>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-6817</p>
<p>Which cites this as Limitation:</p>
<p>&rt;Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others.</p>
<p>You must be referring to another study, correct?</p>
<p>&rt;Every other study doesn’t control all the variables, so they include hand washing and anti social distance as variables for the masked side. Even if masks had some effectiveness asymptomatic transmission of Covid basically doesn’t exist. So there is no reason for someone healthy to wear one. </p>
<p>Thats really impressive that you were able to go through all of those studies that a Google search came up with that quickly. Its more impressive that you were also able to determine that every single study "doesn't control all of the variables".</p>
<p>I would ask for you to open any of the studies I linked, and show me where you feel the disparity is. As I did with the study I <em>think</em> you're referring to. </p>
<p>Of course, if that isn't the study you're referring to I'd be glad to read the one you <em>are</em> referring to.</p>

        <p>That is the danish study. Of course it’s not perfect, but it was or is one of the only randomized control studies (studying Covid not influenza). The first study which popped up for mask efficacy was a compilation of studies, many to study the effectiveness of masks against influenza, but let’s assume they transmit the same way which it seems likely they do, and which causes problems for the pro-mask narrative. Here’s an excerpt I found interesting from that compilation of studies:</p>
<p>We showed lower rates of infection outcomes in the medical mask arm compared to control, but the difference was not significant (MacIntyre et al., 2011). It could be that larger trials are needed to demonstrate efficacy of a mask, but any protection is far less than from a respirator. A trial we conducted in Vietnam of 2-layered cotton cloth masks compared to medical masks showed a lower rate of infection in the medical mask group, and a 13 times higher risk of infection in the cloth mask arm</p>
<p>So not a significant difference between medical masks and control, and cloth masks which are the most commonly worn increase risks of infection significantly. So why do governments force their citizens to wear something which causes them more harm than good? Even if the government mandated medical grade masks only, those are limited in supply and would be most useful for medical professionals. Even if they ignored that, the difference with infection rate with medical grade masks isn’t significant. </p>
<p>Also, what happened to the flu? The CDC is no longer tracking the flu, and my relatives in the health care industry tell me their superiors say they aren’t allowed to diagnose influenza. The pro-mask narrative likes to say that masks are the reason for flu apparently being gone, but if flu and Covid transmit similarly which is the assumption of those mask studies you linked, them shouldn’t Covid be nonexistent as well? Also the majority of the populace is wearing cloth masks which these studies show don’t do anything. </p>
<p>If anything these studies in tandem with government actions attack their own narrative, that there is an exceptionally deadly virus going around that requires exceptional measures to maintain society. All of this is on top of how asymptomatic transmission isn’t a thing, presymptomatic transmission does exist but we do not have evidence that it drives outbreaks, in other words the majority who get sick get sick from people who are symptomatic. Then there’s the PCR test with a high false positive rate. This month I believe is where Reiner Fuellmich and other attorneys will take this fraudulent test to court, given that it’s been used as evidence to lock us down. I bring all this up because it’s not just about masks and it never had been there are layers upon layers of inconsistencies which dispute the legitimacy of everything that’s happened the past 9 months. You sound like you are somewhat interested in rationality, evidence so once the PCR test is exposed in court (it’s been exposed as unreliable many times before by many different people, including the creator himself Kary Mullis) 
Interviews with Katy Mullis:
https://youtu.be/L6Wy1FQCGmU</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/nkXLdq1K4QU
, anyway once the PCR test is exposed in court then you should open your eyes to a lot of this fraud. But right now I doubt what I say will have much effect on what you believe as that’s how belief works, it’s hard to change your beliefs after living life based around one. I too at the beginning got caught by the fear but eventually the inconsistencies made it clear to me that we were being lied to, and hopefully it will become clear to you as well.</p>

<p>They literally tell you that people did not adhere to the rules of the study, and that the results can't be used due to the inaccuracies of people self reporting all of the data from home.</p>
<p>If you're worried about the integrity of the data, then this certainly isn't the study you should be touting.</p>
<p>&rt;The first study which popped up for mask efficacy was a compilation of studies, many to study the effectiveness of masks against influenza, but let’s assume they transmit the same way which it seems likely they do, and which causes problems for the pro-mask narrative. Here’s an excerpt I found interesting from that compilation of studies:</p>
<p>There have been studies on masks for years. Instead of looking at some larger compilation that starts with information from a decade ago, you should look at more recent information. </p>
<p>&rt;So not a significant difference between medical masks and control, and cloth masks which are the most commonly worn increase risks of infection significantly. So why do governments force their citizens to wear something which causes them more harm than good? Even if the government mandated medical grade masks only, those are limited in supply and would be most useful for medical professionals. Even if they ignored that, the difference with infection rate with medical grade masks isn’t significant. </p>
<p>Medical masks are absolutely easily available to the public. I have a box of 50 right in my closet.</p>
<p>You admit medical masks work. Then wear them.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, what happened to the flu? The CDC is no longer tracking the flu, </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/index.html</p>
<p>Yes they are?</p>
<p>&rt;and my relatives in the health care industry tell me their superiors say they aren’t allowed to diagnose influenza. The pro-mask narrative likes to say that masks are the reason for flu apparently being gone, but if flu and Covid transmit similarly which is the assumption of those mask studies you linked, them shouldn’t Covid be nonexistent as well? Also the majority of the populace is wearing cloth masks which these studies show don’t do anything. </p>
<p>Well your relatives must be lying to you, because all I had to do was google 2020 flu season and found that the CDC is still tracking flu numbers for this flu season.</p>
<p>&rt;If anything these studies in tandem with government actions attack their own narrative, that there is an exceptionally deadly virus going around that requires exceptional measures to maintain society. All of this is on top of how asymptomatic transmission isn’t a thing, presymptomatic transmission does exist but we do not have evidence that it drives outbreaks, in other words the majority who get sick get sick from people who are symptomatic. Then there’s the PCR test with a high false positive rate. This month I believe is where Reiner Fuellmich and other attorneys will take this fraudulent test to court, given that it’s been used as evidence to lock us down. I bring all this up because it’s not just about masks and it never had been there are layers upon layers of inconsistencies which dispute the legitimacy of everything that’s happened the past 9 months. You sound like you are somewhat interested in rationality, evidence so once the PCR test is exposed in court (it’s been exposed as unreliable many times before by many different people, including the creator himself Kary Mullis) Interviews with Katy Mullis: https://youtu.be/L6Wy1FQCGmU</p>
<p>The fact that you weren't even willing to google whether or not the CDC was still tracking Flu numbers when you lead with that bombshell tells me the quality of this information. </p>
<p>&rt;https://youtu.be/nkXLdq1K4QU , anyway once the PCR test is exposed in court then you should open your eyes to a lot of this fraud. But right now I doubt what I say will have much effect on what you believe as that’s how belief works, it’s hard to change your beliefs after living life based around one. I too at the beginning got caught by the fear but eventually the inconsistencies made it clear to me that we were being lied to, and hopefully it will become clear to you as well. </p>
<p>Again, I hope you confront those relatives of yours who lied to you because the CDC is 100% definitely still tracking flu numbers.</p>
<p>I think you should reflect on <em>your</em> worldview if the first thing you say can be so easily proven false with 10 seconds of searching.</p>

<p>There was a time this year when the CDC paused tracking influenza I guess they started again, but even then the cases are exceptionally low. Several people have screenshots of when that was the case, here is one, the website was probably updated. </p>
<p>https://mobile.twitter.com/diana_duguay/status/1320766991393787907</p>
<p>Either way flu appears to have almost disappeared this year as if it was cured by Covid. </p>
<p>By medical masks I mean N-95. I should have been more specific in my terminology, I did say medical grade, those disposal masks are basically useless as well, just not as bad as cloth masks since cloth masks increase risks of infection. </p>
<p>Anyway, you’ll never quit following the cult until the cult is destroyed. As usual the parts of my argument you attack are the most irrelevant, even if the CDC is tracking flu cases right now the flu cases are very unusually low. My point still stands regardless. I already explained the mixup with the terminology, I was referring to medical grade as in N-95. Of course you don’t address any other parts of the argument because you are unable to challenge them, the fact that the PCR test in unreliable, that asymptomatic spread is basically nonexistent and presymptomatic spread is far from a driver of outbreaks. That the creator of the PCR test sees Fauci as misusing his invention, and that many people are taking the results of the PCR test he created to mean something they don’t. But like I said it will take a lot for you to leave the contradictory cult. I made mistakes in getting across my argument but even with those taken into account it still stands just as strong as ever. Whereas your narrative falls apart from many different angles which is why you don’t address them.</p>

        <p>If they work how come R curves, case curves and mortality curves show no rate of change no matter where universal masking is brought in? Cases still continue to rise and deaths still continue to happen independently of mask wearing and other interventions.  Empirical  science is based on observations with your own eyes.  There is no evidence that masks have had any impact on the spread of the virus.  It’s undeniable.</p>

        <p>Thats the problem, it can't be traced to when/wear/who. The person who picked it up probably went three other places that day, interacted with so many people. <em>The science</em> says that masks aren't 100% so the person could've picked it up from anyone. Safest thing for the people who are susceptible is to...stay home and let the other people carry on with their lives. Where was this outrage and lock down when immune-compromised people had a higher chance of dying around flu season.</p>
