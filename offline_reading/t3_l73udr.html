    <strong>DAE see the connection between the Gamestop trading developments and NNN?</strong>
    <p><p>I admittedly know very little about the stock market, but like many others I've been paying close attention to what's been going on with the hedge fund managers who lost bigtime due to a grassroots campaign to boost the value of Gamestop's stock. Now, trading apps won't let you trade certain stocks freely. The market has been halted several times in order to prevent more people from buying and selling, while the elite hedge fund managers can do as they please. I'm starting to see news articles about how this is all actually really bad for the stock market and will hurt people. Discord removed WSB from their server due to "potential for violence."</p>
<p>It's happening all over again. People are being censored and disenfranchised for their "safety" by corporations, who have free reign to do whatever they want as private companies. Freedoms are restricted, but not if you have enough money or power. </p>
<p>This is part of the new normal: immediate pushback against any populist movement; grassroots movements being suffocated by apps, websites, and Big Tech who see their interests threatened. And of course, this is all allowed to happen because if we don't like it, we're free to make our own stock exchange and our own trading apps.</p>
<p>I hope this wakes more people up. The same people who are manipulating the market are the ones deciding which businesses can stay open and making life miserable for anyone not wanting to wear a mask or be vaccinated. If they can restrict access to certain websites (Parler), completely deplatform dissenters (Trump, "anti-maskers"), manipulate stocks and currency (halt the market, prevent trading) they WILL take it further and further.</p></p>

        <p>I mean. Excluding someone just because of their sexual orientation is pretty low. You have to draw the line somewhere. What if a white business started refusing service to black people? What about vice versa? Would you be OK with that? This is precisely the kind of thing the civil rights act was passed for. </p>
<p>So where do you draw the line? Should private businesses be allowed to discriminate against certain groups of people? I think the answer is no. </p>
<p>This applies to Twitter and Facebook trying to censor viewpoints they don’t like as well. Private business needs to follow some set of rules that society has put in place. </p>
<p>These rules need to apply to both the cake shop as well as the large tech company. I think the different ways the rules are being applied/enforced is where the confusion is coming from.</p>

<p>Being gay isn't a protected class. A christian bakery doesn't have to make a cake for a gay wedding. </p>
<p>&rt;What if a white business started refusing service to black people?</p>
<p>The opposite happened at a bakery in mississippi; they were black only. Im trying to find it online but it has seemed to be memory holed from the internet. </p>
<p>Also during chop, they made the park in Seattle "black only". </p>
<p>Which is segregation, and violates the civil rights act of 1964</p>

        <p>What does HIPPA have to do with you not wearing a mask? It’s about protecting your health information, meaning your doctor cannot tell the Tesco why you can’t wear a mask, it says nothing about you not having to tell them before they let in. Or ADA? ADA often actually requires disclosing the disability to allow for the reasonable accommodation, since how can you accommodate a condition you don’t know. Allowing curbside is such an accommodation.</p>

        <p>I am saying that HIPPA only applies to its covered entities which are Health Plans, Most Health Care Providers, and Health Care Clearinghouses and its associates. Arguing that this law covers people it clearly states it does not you might as well claim your privacy at the grocery store should be protected under FERPA. </p>
<p>https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance-materials-for-consumers/index.html</p>
<p>As for ADA here is a wonderful website that actually covers the ADA “reasonable accommodation process” which is what the law provides as its remedy. I would like to highlight step 2 “After receiving a request for a reasonable modification, talk with the individual with a disability to learn <em>why</em> the person needs to modify the face mask policy and to find a solution that meets ADA requirements. Decisions about reasonable modifications should be made in a timely manner.” </p>
<p>https://www.adasoutheast.org/ada/publications/legal/ada-and-face-mask-policies.php#t6</p>
<p>As the department of justice said about ADA applying to face masks “The ADA does not provide a blanket exemption to people with disabilities from complying with legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operations.”</p>
<p>https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-warns-inaccurate-flyers-and-postings-regarding-use-face-masks-and</p>
<p>I think the issue is you don’t actually know the scope of either of these laws, but they sound like they sort of apply. I am not arguing about if they procedures are needed or not, I am saying your knowledge of the law sucks. Which is a pretty black and white fact as you mentioned. So where are your sources to support your reading of the law?</p>

        <p>why are you even arguing for the wrong side of history? anyways you are wrong. you dont need to explain why you are wearing sunglasses indoors, you dont need to explain why you are wearing a mask, or why not, or why you are in a mobility scooter, or why you walk with a limp, or any other medical issues, service must be provided if its open the the public. businesses have even been sued for accosting people about lesser things like why is a autistic child acting the way he is and needs to act differently. things like that are a big no no</p>

        <p>Well now there are articles being published about how the idea to buy gamestop stock is rooted in white supremacy and "Trumpism". </p>
<p>For me it would be very eye-opening. The MSM always use the same buzzwords to sway public opinion. Being anti-lockdown is white supremacy, wanting to open schools is white supremacy, thinking there was voter fraud is white supremacy and now buying gamestop stocks is white supremacy. </p>
<p>If the MSM is attributing racism to something that is not inherently about race, it should be a huge red flag for people.</p>
