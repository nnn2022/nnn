    <strong>Conversations I've had with friends about the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>So where I'm from a lot of people my age were pretty skeptical of the vaccine but once people my age (18) could get it they all got it. Here's some of the conversations I've had with these people.</p>
<p>Friend 1: Why haven't you got your vaccine yet?</p>
<p>Me: I'm worried about the long term side effects.</p>
<p>Friend 1: I am too. But I got it because I have a 16 week old nephew and I need to protect him.</p>
<p>Me: You already had COVID. So why did you get the vaccine?</p>
<p>Friend 2: Immunity only lasts 3 months and I have an autoimmune disease. (She did get pretty sick and couldn't do stairs for a couple months but she never went to the hospital and she's fine now)</p>
<p>Friend 3: It's not a big deal it took like 15 minutes to get the vaccine and my arm hurt for half a day.</p>
<p>Friend 4: Anyone who doesn't get the vaccine shouldn't be able to take their masks off when they get rid of the mandate because they're being selfish.</p>
<p>Me: But you got the vaccine so you're protected. Why do I need to get it?</p>
<p>Friend 4: The vaccine isn't 100% effective.</p>
<p>Me and friend 4 talked about how lockdowns are stupid and how she doesn't want to get the vaccine either as recently a few weeks ago. She's been breaking the rules constantly with having parties while we weren't allowed to have people over. Now as soon as she gets the vaccine she thinks this? Wtf?</p>
<p>So yeah I don't have many friends left but I don't care. I'm not getting the fucking vaccine no matter what. Hopefully I get the last laugh when they're unable to reproduce.</p></p>

        <p>Your friends have been brainwashed by the msm and fear machine. They literally contradict themselves in their statements..... Best case scenario they wake the fuck up and leave you alone, worst case scenario they‚Äôre all dead in two years. Only time will tell and it‚Äôs scary as fuck. I feel you on this, I‚Äôm trying prepare myself for the worst. I know so many people who got the jab.... the fact that you are keeping you wits about you gives me hope though</p>

        <p>To friend 2 - nah look at the science articles in paper Nature about long term immunity.</p>
<p>Friend 3 - good for you!</p>
<p>Friend 4 - But they say that even that vaccine isnt 100% effective in protection it is 100% on protecting from death and serious illness, and since you took the vaccine you believe them yes?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Otherwise good that some in your age dont fall for group pressure and have a mind of your own! :D</p>

        <p>Most people follow the path of least resistance, even when it is obviously the wrong or even stupid thing to do in the long term. People want to be part of the in-group. People need to follow the leader of the pack, it is part of our DNA.</p>
<p>The alternative is to reject the pack, find another one, or start one yourself or be on your own. For most followers, leaving the pack means certain death.</p>
<p>On a modern societal level this eventually probably means losing your status, job and maybe even your home. Luckily the western world is weak, what got us into this mess is the same thing that will prevent us from losing it all: the obsession with saving every last soul. Else we will have to fight for our rights, and the weak Western society is no match for anyone righteous and devoted.</p>
<p>Also, it is true that vaccines are safe and effective. Meaning, it is unlikely to kill you short term and you are likely to not get the virus short term. Of course these have nothing to do with what the vaccine really is doing and most negative effects will be impossible to trace back to it.  And that is what sticks from all vaccine experiences.</p>
<p>"I got a lot of shots and never died from any of those horrible diseases, yes I have a lot of allergies and feel terribly tired and depressed due to my ADHD and the fact that I cannot get pregnant, but that is all unrelated."</p>
