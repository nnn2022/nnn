    <strong>Political Radicalization</strong>
    <p><p>I'm starting to feel politically radicalized by the lockdowns and my excessive time on the internet.</p>
<p>I watched a bunch of videos online during the whole US election thing. I even argued with my boss at work over politics. I feel like normally my watching things and getting tense would have been tempered by going out. I'd have argued with someone at a bar while those thoughts were still half baked and I definitely wouldn't have said anything to my boss if I was talking to other people regularly.</p></p>

<p>I think this is partly why you see alot of normie boomer types falling into the Q hole. On the plus side I managed to get my mom awake about the lockdowns and the great reset.... On the other hand she is now trusting the plan. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

        <p>Same! I studied Poli sci in college and love politics and political talk so I certainly paid attention and always have and have strong political views, but even after 2016, when I had to go out and be normal, it just wasn‚Äôt at the forefront of my mind. </p>
<p>Now I‚Äôm just looking to argue with anyone anywhere because they‚Äôre all WRONG and definitely notice even jsut taking an hour off the internet makes things a lot better</p>

        <p>Always be careful about talking politics at work. Especially in this day and age, people will find some excuse to get you fired if you think the wrong way. </p>
<p>I wouldn‚Äôt use the term radicalized to describe what‚Äôs going on with people realizing how fucked up the system is, but rather the term ‚Äúredpilled.‚Äù The system has been fucked up for years, and more people are realizing it.</p>

        <p>I guess radical times call for "radical" views. Putting the 2nd one in quotation marks because when the mainstream media is calling for society to be completely disrupted for an indefinite period of time (and running vicious Two Minutes Hate campaigns on anyone who tries to do normal things), what does "moderate" even mean? Hate to be the one to invoke Godwin's law here, but what did "moderate" look like in Germany when Hitler was in power? Or in the US during the time of slavery or Jim Crow laws? Etc.</p>
<p>Bringing it back to the present: yeah, I've started to consume and agree with more "conspiracy" media. (Primarily the Corbett Report podcast and the blog http://www.wrenchinthegears.com ). But that is because the mainstream/left pushed me away. It was fine for me to consume a ton of MSNBC and liberal podcasts in the beginning of 2020 when I was excited about the Sanders campaign, which at the time wanted to give me stuff (way cheaper healthcare, free college, training in "green new deal" jobs) instead of taking stuff away (cafes, live music, the ability to socialize normally). It was not so fine when my previous news sources had regular stories shaming people for partying and acting like total isolation, enforced by government fiat, was no big deal. So naturally I looked for media that wouldn't tell me normal was evil and fascism was normal. And the narratives that made most logical sense to me were the ones that blamed our current state of affairs on Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab and similar elite technocrats. </p>
<p>(I didn't become "radicalized" enough to blame everything on the Jews. In part because I know too many in real life, but also because the mainstream was stuffed full of hate for regular people in the form of diatribes against partiers and non-maskers, why would I want more of that "hate your neighbor" bs?)</p>

        <p>Massively so. I have never felt this strongly about anything tbh. I‚Äôve spoiled my last few ballots on election day believing that anyone I might vote for is a corrupt and self serving chucklefuck. I‚Äôve tried to avoid talking about politics with friends because I find it boring and futile. I‚Äôve been sceptical every time people my age think a politician is a messiah figure (Corbyn, Sanders). </p>
<p>This has just pushed me over the edge. I talk about it constantly, attend protests and I‚Äôve even got this wank-fantasy of standing against Matt Hancock if there‚Äôs a snap election on the basis that I couldn‚Äôt do any worse and I‚Äôd do it for half the money!</p>

        <p>Okay. Don't make posts like this. You might feel on the fence now, but you are leaving a paper trail and will regret it later.</p>
<p>if you're upset at the world, don't tell social media. And not because you're a danger to society, but because glowing people are combing the United States looking for people like you. And it's not hard to entrap someone on the fence.</p>
<p>Never say anything on the internet you wouldn't say publicly. I'm sorry, but that's the way it is</p>
