    <strong>A rant about the 'new normal'</strong>
    <p><p>Using a throwaway account because for the most part I play into the narrative and I can’t really be bothered with being condemned for my view points.</p>
<p>I’m fed up with all these rules and restrictions. I’m in my early 20s which is meant to be the best time of my life but I’m stuck indoors, not allowed to travel and see different cultures and having my job and future career threatened. Honestly, wearing a mask doesn’t bother me. I can get by with that. I’m even happy enough to use the contact tracing app just like when I go to the airport, I’m happy for them to pat me down and search my bag. It’s all a theatre. Our governments know that this virus isn’t as bad as everyone was worried about back in March yet they continue with the restrictions. I live in the UK and we’ve just had our highest jump in cases in a fair while but you know what isn’t going up? Deaths and hospitalisations but even if they were, we always knew that would be the case. 6 months ago, everywhere you looked people were making sure that we were flattening the curve. Well guess what? The curve was flattened pretty well and the NHS never became overwhelmed. There is absolutely no reason for these restrictions to continue. People are losing their jobs and businesses for something with a 97% survival rate.</p>
<p>This turned into a bit of a rant but I’m just fed up with it all. Everything that has happened over the past 6 months has caused me to go into a depression and I will absolutely refuse this new normal because it’s not normal. Humans are naturally social so for us all to isolate ourselves is bullshit.</p></p>

        <p>Congratulations, you have a brain that is at least somewhat functioning. Now go and live as normally as you possibly can. Don't be afraid to speak up, but be tactful. Civil discussion is possible. Acknowledge other people's concerns and then plant a small seed of doubt. Be the change you wish to see.</p>

        <p>If you honestly don’t like it, then don’t play along in any way, shape, or form unless <em>absolutely necessary</em> for your job or your physical safety. </p>
<p>The world is the sum of our individual choices and actions. We get the world we collectively deserve. If you don’t like it but play along to avoid mere inconvenience, then <em>you</em> get the world that you deserve.</p>
