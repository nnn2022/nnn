    <strong>A question no one has answered</strong>
    <p><p>If the vaccine is effective, why do they care if us conspiracy theorists take it or not? If they're vaccinated and immune then why do they care if we have it?</p>
<p>Is it because they're worried about our well being? Surely that's not true, the state sells and taxes cigarettes and alcohol which kill thousands of people everyday. So what's their reasoning behind this campaign to coerce everyone to take the vaccine or else life will be made impossible?</p></p>

        <p>Ding! Nailed it. Masks are just another iteration of people getting to claim moral high ground. They want to feel righteous and can only do that by putting other people "in their place". Masks, LBGTQ+ acceptance, BLM, etc, etc, etc. It's all the same condition.</p>

        <p>That is the question that a lot of people ask.</p>
<p>The answer boils down to "You don't keep immunity to a coronavirus you have been infected with forever!"</p>
<p>6 months minimum to 24 months max is the absolute most immunity lasts for a coronavirus from medical research dating back 20 years.</p>
<p>That said? I don't trust these mRNA vaccines, even my medical laboratory worker parents who died from CoVid-19 did not understand them and told me to avoid them in 2019.</p>

        <p>Let me get this straight: Your parents cautioned you LAST YEAR to specifically avoid mRNA vaccines, a class of vaccines they didn't understand, that was largely unknown outside biotech, had never been evaluated for human use beyond Phase I trials before the coronavirus pandemic, and was authorized for the first time in history three days ago. </p>

        <p>No, I'm telling you his story is bullshit. There is no way his "parents," who didn't understand how mRNA vaccines even work, would have warned him not to take a vaccine that used an obscure technique, hadn't been tested in Phase III and was still in development. </p>

        <p>Really? How were they able to protect against degradation by extracellular RNases and introduce the mRNA intracellularly prior to the development of LPN encapsulation? What do you think about lyophilization as an alternative to cold-chain delivery?</p>

        <p>This strain of coronavirus, COVID19, appeared in 2019. Other types of coronaviruses have been around much longer i.e. SARS hence some of the the basic features of this family of viruses are similar and have been researched much longer.</p>

        <p>In the case, whose to say after COVID19 is "over", another strain of the virus won't make it's way into the population. That's why it's so important for us to stand up, otherwise they could play this lockdown/mask/vaccine game with us forever.</p>

        <p>And you as a pharmaceutical expert are capable of making that determination? Or like everyone else here are you just parroting the crap you've seen online?</p>
<p>Yes there are risks. There are risks to literally every vaccine, reguardless of how "tried and true" they are. There is always the chance that you have a reaction to something that others wouldn't.</p>
<p>We absolutely need a vaccine so we can put this all behind us and get back to our lives. If you don't like it, go form your own country of like-minded people somewhere. I'll give it a year before some disease wipes you all out.</p>

        <p>I don't need to be an expert in pharmaceuticals to see positive cash flow in vaccines. 99.97% survivability rate isn't worth potential risks of a vaccine that just came out. As I said before it's more for the loud fearful minority who make everything harder for everyone</p>

        <p>I actually argued with Redditors some time back about that same BLM point and their defense was always the same 'it doesn't mean what it would otherwise clearly mean/imply' shtick. Even if that was true, and it was more about <em>normalizing non traditional families</em> than <em>eradicating traditional ones</em>, they could, you know, <strong>just fucking say so</strong>. </p>
<p>The Double-Speak is real amongst these ideologues. You can never trust what these people say. They literally don't use words and sentences in the common way or usual sense of the word/phrase. Slavery can mean Freedom, War can mean Peace kind of shit. Now BLM has pulled the statement. Presumably because of all the negative attention it was attracting. Still, I think BLM and Progressives mean exactly what they say. They just want to reserve the right to remain popular in case their original position proves unpopular. They live and breathe by framing the narrative in their favor — they have to gaslight, suppress and or else they'll be exposed for who they really are. Everything good that has ever happened in America was thanks to Democrats and nothing good has ever come from Republicans. They will twist words, destroy statues and rewrite entire sections of history that might even allude to otherwise.</p>
<p>I don't mean to call out women, but anyone whose every argued with a woman, especially one who is highly liberal and emotional/neurotic, knows exactly these sort of tactics. They twist words and events to make you the Asshole™, especially in situations when they were clearly the ones in the wrong. Fauci was right when he said don't wear mask, but he's also right saying that everyone should wear a mask. Cuomo was right for putting Covid patients in nursing homes, but he's also right saying I'm responsible for killing Grandma. It's okay for politicians and movie stars to get their hair done and party (their private Jets of course), but I'm recklessly endangering others by celebrating Thanksgiving. Biden is the most popular presidential candidate in history despite not filling out crowds at his rallies.</p>
<p>2020 has been a real eye opener. By my own estimates, 20-30% of Americans are completely brain dead useful idiots and another 30-40% are complete cowards who would rather learn to live with tyranny than face even a hint of adversity in their lives. It's hard to believe that this is still America, the (former) Home of the Brave and Land of the Free. Maybe it's always been like this. 2020 they just stopped trying to hide it.</p>

        <p>I could not agree with you more on all points. I went to a private Catholic college for my undergrad and there was still a ton of SJW/woke crap everywhere. I even took a class on Minority Relations. The only thing I really remember from that class was all the discussions which were really just victimhood circle jerks. </p>
<p>Growing up, my mother was like the original far leftist. She hated Republicans so much that if a house had red lights during the holidays it must be a Republican family. She would shake the devil hand symbol at churches. I cannot even begin to IMAGINE what she would've been like today. I think she would've literally been so rage fueled with TDS she would've had an aneurysm. </p>
<p>The Leftist narrative constantly contradicts itself, particularly with race. Race is a social construct but we must make everything about race but you must also treat everyone the same without also being colorblind. Um, what? Can you make up your mind, please? We are going to constantly tell minorities, primarily blacks, that they are incapable of being successful without intervention from Uncle Sam. They just inherently cannot reach the same level of the super privilege whites have. But treating an entire population like children is not racist at all. Biden wants to be interviewed by a figure in the black community. He chooses Cardi B. Probably the one of the most insulting people he could have chosen to represent black Americans. We'll also ignore the fact that we had a black president and all the black Americans that makes millions every year. We must pass affirmative action and have different standard for different people. Which implies that a population just can be as good as the rest of us. But again, that is not being racist.</p>
<p>Riots and leftist protests are perfectly safe. Anything else is a super spreader event. Trump supporters are somehow both the "rich corporatist elites" and the "redneck illiterate white trash." We already tried a lockdown that didn't work but doing it again will make a difference this time. The virus has a 99% survival rate, low transmission rate, less than 1% of the population fatality rate, but we must convince everyone that they have a moral obligation to take an experimental mRNA vaccine produced by companies with 0 liability on outcomes. We're going to stay masked up for another 100 days. Why 100? We've been wearing useless masks for practically the entire year but somehow another 100 days will make a magical difference. This virus has been used to divide the population even further, sowing hatred for "otherness." I have found it is damn near impossible to talk to leftists now because they believe themselves to be superior to everyone else - and yet anyone who disagrees with them is a supremacist.</p>
<p>The Democrats have certainly let their mask slip and they barely even try to hide their bias, impropriety, hypocrisy, logical fallacy, and cognitive dissonance anymore. If you are a dissenter that believes in liberty, freedom, free will, self-reliance and the Constitution it increasingly feels like you're out on an an ideological island alone. Which is how they want us to feel. Give up and obey. Join the dark side.</p>

Being a naturalized African myself, I can tell you that every successful Black/African person I know is down to Earth, hard working, finished high school (even late in some cases), religious, family oriented and are waiting/waited until marriage for kids. It turns out that the exact same things that make whites, Asians and jews successful, also works for blacks and Hispanics. Yet, in the last 5 years, I've known at least half a dozen dudes personally from HS/College who are either dead or in prison right now. Some of them even made the nightly news lol. Imagine how surreal it feels to read articles online about guys you used to hang out with pistol whipping and tying up clerks during a robbery. Or talking to a Mom after her son you knew in HS overdosed. Democrat Policies have destroyed Black Communities, and slowly, they've destroyed white communities too. But Democrats will never admit that. And 90% of Blacks aren't ready to have that conversation. </p>
<p>So I keep my head down and try to save a little cash. I never wore a mask throughout this whole pandemic and won't take their stupid vaccine. I actually only got shit for the first time about a mask from a stranger on Thanksgiving Day. She was black ironically. Not a peep from like the dozens of white folk I encountered that day (most, but not all, were wearing a mask). I'm not even mid 20s yet, but a modern homestead outside the Metros and their post-modern craziness is like the dream right now. Maybe somewhere near the Great Lakes. Life is actually pretty simply once you get politics out of the way. I actually joke with family that they'd never suspect there's a pandemic going on if they just stopped watching the news. I managed to bring my brother around, but the women especially have really bought into everything. My sister has even lost friends because of how staunch she is about mask and lock downs (they stopped inviting her out). She's very easily the most left leaning member of the family. Yet, I wouldn't say she has TDS. </p>
<p>Funny that your Mom was catholic, therefore likely more traditional. You should of seen how my Mom came to me shaking and worried about Covid back in March. She is extremely traditional on one hand yet believes everything she sees on YouTube and CNN on the other. She's against abortions, Feminism, LGBT, Drugs, Pre-marital Sex, thinks women need to know how to cook and clean, prays like an hour a day (that's not an exaggeration)... the whole 9 yards. Yet, she voted for Biden on election night, who openly advocates against her most basic beliefs. I asked how she could vote for someone like Biden to begin with and she did it for no other reason than not liking Trump. Nothing about his policy. It was completely asinine. She even told me about a dream she had where Christ was preparing his Chariots and <em>God</em> told her that Biden was going to win. I don't know what to make of her dream, she's been wrong before, but everything else points 100% TDS.</p>
<p>I'm just removed from everything at this point. There are some people that really think that these are the real biblical end times. But Life goes on. Even if I have to go it alone, I'll keep up the fight, making my peace with God along the way. Whatever happens, will happen. I only know for sure that things can't continue like this. Ultimately, something is going to have to give.</p>

        <p>The way Democrats and the left treat black Americans to me is absolutely disgusting. I don't understand how someone who isn't black can take it like it's their personal mission to speak on the behalf of blacks, yet say it's everyone else suppressing their voice. And obviously to them black conservatives don't even exist or aren't worth acknowledging at all. And yet they are the party of inclusion and social justice.</p>
<p>They came out with that chart months ago that outlined everything that makes an individual, a family, and generation successful. Self reliance and accountability, working hard, maintaining the nuclear family, having strong principles and values, etc. They attributed all these characteristics to white culture. How is that not INSANELY racist? I seriously do not understand how so many people can be duped.</p>
<p>My brother is fairly liberal and said it was embarrassing that I went to a Pence rally. I tried to explain to him that I think it's important to see those in power when you can and hear their own words from their mouths. Regardless of party I think this is important. When you see the person in the flesh it humanizes them and they become more than a character you see in press briefings, etc. </p>
<p>I certainly hope Biden won't be in office but it seems like that is what's going to happen. Even with the TDS your mom sounds like a wonderful woman and her commitment to God is something to admire. I am not praying as much as I should. I turned away from God for a long time and it wasn't until this year that I started back on the right path and I don't think it's a coincidence. I have gone from a child in youth group who had several strong religious experiences, to turning away completely and became atheist as a teenager into young adulthood, then essentially agnostic, and now someone working on building a relationship with God again. I do not yet feel worthy of calling myself a Christian again. God has always been waiting for me to return.</p>
<p>I'm from Wisconsin so I'm biased towards my home state. Wonderful farmland and yes lots of cowns and cheese and German and Italian influences in many places. The great lakes in general is a great area and the lakes are so huge it's like living next to an ocean without worrying about hurricanes, etc. I share your dream. I'm not cut out for the desk job life. That's what I'm doing now and I hate it. I'd rather do yardwork or help out on a farm. I like to be physical and work hard. I spent many summers growing up in northern Arkansas which is very beautiful and a lot of good people in small towns. I've thought about retiring in Arkansas. Not too hot, not too cold.</p>
<p>I'm exhausted with it all at this point as well. I try not to get too worried about the grim direction the country could go in. I'm proud of my country and the freedoms we enjoy. Patriots like ourselves will always prevail.</p>

<p>My feelings exactly. Progressives and Racist ironically agree on everything. </p>

<p>The two biggest regrets of my life are not meeting Steve Wozniak (I got to lunch with him after a speech he gave while I was undergrad, but was too chicken shit to talk with him or get a picture afterwards) and meeting Stan Lee (who passed away a year later) when I had the chance. Meet influential people, especially those who inspire you, while you still can.</p>
<p>&rt;Even with the TDS your mom sounds like a wonderful woman and her commitment to God is something to admire.</p>
<p>She is great in a lot of ways. You would not believe the fervor in which she prays until you've seen it yourself. I just wish she wasn't so easily manipulated by others. At least a few times growing up, she bought into obvious scams and pyramid schemes. She assumes that everyone has the best intentions for her because she has the best intentions for them.</p>
<p>I never strayed far enough from the Faith to call myself Atheist/Agonistic, but there's definitely something to re-discovering religion as a grown up, compared to being dragged along as a child. I grow more comfortable each day.</p>

<p>It was actually a stint in Madison (for University) that made me fall in love with the Great Lakes area and rural-er life in general. Excluding Milwaukee, Wisconsin is a ridiculously beautiful state in the fall, and the people are amongst the most friendly and sociable in the Midwest. When I permanently decide on settling down, it's near the top of my list with North/West parts of Michigan. </p>
<p>I'll have to look into Arkansas. We might have driven through there on the way to Alabama once. I only remember hearing about the big opioid problem that region of the US had been having (it might have have been Missouri or Tennessee though). Supposedly they got some of the hottest women in the US in that area too.</p>
<p>&rt;Patriots like ourselves will always prevail.</p>
<p>Could not have said it any better myself.</p>

        <p>I've grown a lot over the last few years and changed a lot. I started seeing the Democrats/leftists/sjw-woke people for who they really are. I have become more conservative and even got my ccw (no gun yet though) because I believe in the right to protect yourself, family, and property. Sidenote: it is scary the number of leftists that have gotten guns and know 0 about gun and self-defense law and do not respect the responsibility of gun ownership.</p>
<p>I grow more comfortable with religion and God every day as well. Right now I kind of feel like the dog that got all muddy in the backyard and is coming inside with their tail between their legs. I have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>Madison is a nice college city, Milwaukee is not haha. I lived in Milwaukee for 8 years. Yes it has its upsides but I  never want to live there or any other major city ever again. My hometown is Kenosha. When the riots and Rittenhouse situation happened there it made my blood boil. I went back for Thanksgiving (temporarily in AZ right now) and a lot of places have kept their businesses boarded up even though they're open. Kenosha has been slowly improving my entire life so when I saw businesses get destroyed I was so mad. North/Upper Michigan is what we call the Uppers (pronounced yoopers). I've heard very good things but I have never been there.</p>
<p>I'm moving from AZ back to WI. AZ is nice. Sunny, no snow, etc. But I've come to realize how much I miss the seasons. I miss rain. Somewhat miss snow haha. I miss all the lakes and forests. And I hate the desk job I have down here. I was blessed with a good opportunity but it's not for me. I'll be passing through AR when I do move back to see family there. I don't know much about the opioid problem in AR but I never saw any of that in all my summers there. But again, I was always in northern AR and I have heard that southern AR has a ton of problems.
As a kid AR seemed so exotic compared to WI because of the geckos and tree frogs, skinks everywhere, etc. And I certainly saw some pretty ladies.</p>
<p>I wish you the best wherever you land and with God in your heart blessings will continue to come. Much love and respect to you brother</p>

        <p>We also don’t know the long term effects of covid. A lot of people are reporting an ongoing loss of smell. They still cannot taste food many months after being infected with a mild case. Think: they can bite into an onion and not taste it. Eating is miserable for these folks. This is potentially a neurological condition and we don’t yet know the longer term repercussions. A lot of others are suffering chronic health conditions many months after being infected. </p>
<p>So the vaccine has risks, yes, but so does the virus. Covid is not going to take responsibility if you suffer consequences either. In life, we are never given perfect choices. We have to weigh risk against benefit, and in this case the vaccine’s potential benefit to society as a whole outweighs the risk of letting covid run its course without intervention. It may feel rushed, but when you have all the world’s resources thrown behind one single objective, humans are capable of some extraordinary things.</p>

<p>I’m not afraid of vaccines. The risk of injury is generally microscopically low. I also believe in socially responsible behaviour and I’m willing to take a (small) risk to protect the broader community.</p>
<p>Your fear and paranoia is unfortunately not allowing you to see that humans just pulled off an incredible feat in creating a vaccine so quickly. You are suspicious of everyone - even me - suggesting I must be getting paid. Have fun with that.</p>

<p>What fear and paranoia? I'm not afraid of Covid, you or Vaccines.</p>
<p>I'm saying you sound like a shill, because you sound like a shill dude. </p>
<p>People don't talk like that in their day to day, much less online.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope you're at least getting compensated for all the shilling you do on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>I can't imagine talking up that much game about something I haven't even tried yet for free.</p>

        <p>I think it's very safe to say that there are very dangerous contagious diseases out there much more likely to hurt and kill you. Polio, smallpox, meningitis, etc. If you're out in public spreading one of those, that's more easy to consider as a "public health risk". But for acute, mild seasonal illnesses such as those caused by c0ronaviruses and rhinoviruses, that deadliness factor simply isn't there for most people.</p>

<p>we have vaccinated for all three of these. Hell, smallpox was literally eradicated <strong>because</strong> of the vaccine, meaning you will never find smallpox again in our current conditions.</p>

        <p>It's hard to tell the exact true goal of the vaxx but my guess is to weaken immune system and of course the risks that come from a vaxx that has never been deployed to a large scale population before, so in a way we are the guinea pigs and the manufacturers are immune from any liability</p>

        <p>A common argument is that the immunocompromised can’t get vaccines so the rest of us must get vaccinated to protect them. I believe Darwin wants those people’s genes eradicated and the rest of us shouldn’t have to inject poison into our bodies to save the super-weak. That obviously makes me a cold blooded murderer and a domestic terrorist.</p>

        <p>ahh yes the compliant and the complacent.. Now I'm more spiritual than religious but i do recall an excerpt from my earlier teachings that stated "idle hands are the devils workshop" which can really be equated to the complacency before us..</p>
<p>You know, now that I think about it, they have been conditioning us for years to "not get involved", selling it us like it was for our own good, but wow does this make sense now. That's what people are doing who don't believe but aren't responding, they are simply "not getting involved"..</p>

<p>They have taken the principles from real science of the past and applied it today to fabricate and dispense their new science..I hate to admit it, but whoever is working for them behind the scenes are brilliant. </p>
<p>Another great deception. People think politicians are too stupid too come up with these schemes, and they are right, but when they employ mad geniuses in the background, then they themselves don't need to be intelligent, they just need to be smart enough to hire the right people.</p>

        <p>What might you want from me that you could support with a claim that I’m impeding your safety? Are you able to propose a situation?</p>
<p>Let me help you with this suggestion: Let’s hypothetically say that I’m casually discharging a firearm in your general direction. Let’s imagine that what you “want from me” is for me to stop. In this situation you could very rightfully claim that I’m impeding your safety. You see what’s wrong with this, don’t you? By your own reasoning, me recklessly firing rounds toward you is supported by my “freedom” and my “free will”. You being afraid of being struck by a stray bullet doesn’t rightfully put an end to me exercising my freedoms. Is this what you’re saying?</p>
<p>I support your freedom and my freedom but it has limits. This is foundational.</p>

        <p>The explanation is herd immunity. Not everybody will want to get the vaccine, but the idea is that if enough people take the vaccine, the disease will basically die out and even the unvaccinated people won't catch it, because it there won't be much of it going around anymore. Here's an <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/what-is-herd-immunity">explanation of herd immunity and why it's a goal to aim for.</a></p>

        <p>It annoys me to no end that they act like a vaccine is the only way to do that, when we can do it naturally. And then they say our natural immunity isn't effective enough and won't last so what are we supposed to expect from this vaccine?</p>

        <p>Doing it through a vaccine doesn't involve the millions of deaths it would require to eventually achieve herd immunity naturally.</p>
<p>Not sure about you but I think taking a smaller dose of the virus so your body can adapt to it is a much better way of doing that than just saying fuck it, we don't know what's gonna happen but let's let the virus go wild. Let's see what happens.</p>

        <p>Well I see what you mean but this virus isn't very dangerous for the vast majority. I just worry that the vaccine which in comparison to others hasn't spent a lot of time in testing might be potentially more dangerous to people like me with a strong immune system than the actual virus which I'd easily recover from.</p>

        <p>&rt;but this virus isn't very dangerous for the vast majority.</p>
<p>The majority of the country have comorbodities. 6 in 10 have at least one. 4 in 10 have two or more. (https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/infographic/chronic-diseases.htm)</p>
<p>I'm assuming this is what you're talking about. If not, I guess you're talking about the fatality rate in which case, is still a significantly large number of people. At a 2% fatality rate, and with anywhere from a 50 - 90% infection rate needed to achieve herd immunity means that at the very lowest end where we somehow magically get herd immunity from only 50%, that's still 3 million people. 3 million. And that's assuming everything works out perfectly and the fatality rate stays the same which would be impossible. And infact your suggestion would make the fatality rate worse as just letting the virus run wild would overwhelm the hospital system.</p>
<p>https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achieving-herd-immunity-with-covid19.html</p>
<p>&rt;If you’re a healthy 21-year-old, your odds of dying from Covid-19 are about 1 in 100,000 — if you even get Covid-19 in the first place. But if you’re 21 with a preexisting condition, might as well be a healthy 60 year old as far as Covid-19 risk is concerned.</p>

        <p>Cause burning to death in a terrorist attack is the same as dying from sickness. (and often more due to other existing health conditions) Great comparison there buddy. I just don't want to be forced into taking it since I and many others are not endangered by covid.</p>

<p>Can you explain to me how you and many others are not endangered by COVID? If you get COVID will you get sick? Maybe yes, maybe no. Could you pass it onto others who might get sick, potentially fatally so, absolutely. It astonishes me those who show no compassion towards others. </p>

        <p>2996 people died in 9/11. On average in the US there are around 8000 deaths. However, with this year looking to have no significant amount of excess deaths if any (even in Sweden who didn't lock down or enforce masks etc), covid falls in with all of those.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that a lot of covid deaths are people who died with it, not of it (CDC estimates that around 6% of covid deaths were directly caused by the disease), eradicating covid would not prevent these deaths. The average age of death is above 80, and the people within this part of the population are at a high risk from dying of <em>everything</em>, and often have pre existing health conditions. We can try to protect them as best we can, but not at such a high cost.</p>
<p>Of course it hurts that people die. It's awful to lose someone, but it's a sad fact of life that people will die from a number of causes, including sickness. We can try to help that but destroying so many lives to go all denial spiral is just not reasonable. I find it pretty tragic to see people losing their jobs, not being able to feed their families or pay rent, have to shut the doors of their small business forever, dying due to missed treatments or check ups for cancer, suffering mentally, committing suicide, falling into poverty, and all the other awful effects of our response, don't you?</p>
<p>For most, covid causes mild to moderate symptoms that most can recover from with no medical attention required. The survival rate for my age group is well over 99% and for most of the population it remains over 98%. Covid isn't even a death sentence for over 70's, who's chance of survival is 94.6%, still pretty high for the 'deadliest pandemic in 100 years'.</p>
<p>I hope not to pass it on to anyone else, but realistically that's not something we can stop. People who know that they are at risk can take precautions to protect themselves, as they often have for many sicknesses in years past, but I and others cannot be held responsible for the health of other people. That just isn't fair, which is why it's never been the way to act.</p>
<p>I am actually glad there is a vaccine coming. People who are at risk or feel the need can take it, and they no longer feel the need to live in fear and tell others to do the same. I may take it eventually, but I do not feel the need to take a vaccine that was in trials for less than a year for a virus that I am almost certain to recover from. I have assessed my risks, and have nothing against you if you want to take it.</p>

        <p>It sounds like we are both getting towards the same point here, that herd immunity is both of ours (and hopefully everyone else’s goal) so that life could eventually get back to the way it was. This sub is called nonewnormal, after all! And yes, I agree that this whole pandemic has taken a toll on jobs, businesses, people’s mental health,  physical health from lack of care for other issues and so on, but again I think a viable vaccine will help us turn those around quicker than just riding it out without one. </p>
<p>My hope, living in the USA, is that the FDA comes out and says that the vaccine candidates are in fact a safe and effective way to not only protect yourself, but limit spread to others as well. If so, I will be first in line (behind first responders and those at higher risk, of course). </p>
<p>I appreciate your response, and understand your position, hopefully you see where I am coming from as well! ✌️</p>

        <p>I do! I think the whole thing has been an issue of risk balancing, and we seem to have somewhat failed. However, an optional vaccine is great news for all! I have never had any problems taking vaccines, but this one has worried me a little since the usually spend a number of years in testing to check for long term side effects, but that doesn't mean I'll be wary of it for ever. It's most important that those at risk get it anyway. I'm in the UK where a vaccine was recently approved.</p>

        <p>Well, vaccines work because of something called herd immunity. Herd immunity is when there are enough people immune to the virus that it protects the people who aren't. This is helpful to protect those who are immuno-compromised and can't get the vaccine. But when people aren't taking the vaccines, herd immunity can't be achieved, and the immuno-compromised would get the virus, and thus die. Vaccines also don't work 100% of the time, only about 90%, so those people who got the vaccine but aren't immune would need to be also protected by herd immunity. All in all this means that the large majority of the population must get a vaccine in order for it to be effective in controlling the virus.</p>

        <p>“If it’s effective, why do they care if we take it?”</p>
<p>They care because there’s a herd immunity threshold. Imagine a room with the entire floor covered in set mousetraps. What happens when you toss a ball into the room? That’s roughly analogous to what happens when there’s no immunity. Now imagine a similar room, but with mousetraps spaced out, and in boxes. If you tossed a ball into the second room, you might get a couple, but most would avoid getting tripped. In the second room, the spacing and boxes represent how herd immunity works: It helps to minimize the spread of a particular illness by making it less likely for an infected person to come into contact with someone vulnerable to infection.</p>
<p>No vaccine is 100% effective, and there are people who can’t take them for medical reasons, you basically need to vaccinate everyone that you can in order to reach the herd immunity threshold.</p>
<p>At least, that’s the science behind vaccination, and that’s why they’d want to administer the vaccine to everyone—it’s literally how vaccines work.</p>
<p>If you have doubts or theories related to the vaccines themselves, those are completely different issues, and a completely different debate.</p>

        <p>Hey, epidemiologist here. So vaccines are not only an effective tool for an individual’s personal immunity and protection, but for those in the larger world (re: all people). </p>
<p>If all people get the vaccine and it is highly effective, the pathogen (in this case COVID-19) will not have a pool of vulnerable people to circulate in, therefore stamping out circulating virus and subsequent infections.</p>
<p>Also, not everyone can take the vaccine safely yet since it’s untested in certain groups (pregnant woman and children for example). So that’s why all the people who can take it should, to help protect them (see explanation above). </p>
<p>By the way, this is applicable to many infectious diseases, not just Covid-19. Hope that helps!!</p>

        <p>Glad to hear everyone recovered! Well, we don’t know how long your antibodies will last, actually. Given other COVID family of viruses (some cause the common cold for example), your immunity only lasts about 6 months to 18 months. So, if people don’t all take the vaccine, it can still circulate and you may get it again. </p>
<p>For you and your friends it might be a slight inconvenience, and that’s great, but that’s not true for everyone.</p>

        <p>if it's anything like its parent virus, I'm betting a very long lime.  And it's not just antibodies- T-Cell too.  SARS Cov 1 was a one and done virus too.  </p>
<p>And also, this vaccine was based on THIS virus- not the next one or the next one or the next one.  It was based off THIS one and THIS one was defeated by pretty much the entire planet.  So even if this virus turns out to be like the flu, that vaccine won't work and you know that.</p>

        <p>Betting is not how science works, and actually this vaccine was first formulated off the SARS Cov 1 vaccine. </p>

        <p>No I'm not.  But I know enough about vaccines to know that they don't offer immunity to different strains.  I know that any vaccine we get now won't protect us against the next attack if there is one.  </p>
<p>And I know enough to know that SARS was its parent virus and it was a one and done.  I also know that my immune system did its job and there hasn't been a single case of this virus attacking twice (false positives from Rapid and PCR tests run above 25 amplification cycles are not evidence) so I'm not going to get all panicky and afraid like people seem to want me to get.  I've faced down stronger viruses than this one and I'm still here.  </p>
<p>So no, my body my choice.  I'm not going to take a vaccine for a virus I've already beaten.  That would be stupid.   But, I'll stand up and defend your right to take it.</p>

        <p>You are absolutely right that this is not about the next one but about this one, currently. What you’re not grasping is that COVID will continue to circulate (same strain) if people don’t widely take the vaccine. In that time, your immunity from “beating it” will potentially end. </p>
<p>Good luck on your gamble, hope my public health degree helped out at least a tad.</p>

        <p>no.  Because if that was true, we'd all be forced to take vaccines for chicken pox even if we got it as a kid which I did.  Me getting a vaccine for covid won't do anything for me that my immune system hasn't already done.  I am not contagious or spreading this virus.  Taking a vaccine won't make me any less infections considering that I am already not infected.  That is not how vaccines work.</p>
<p>And if that's what they taught you, then you got ripped off in school.   I have 3 degrees in electronics (Aviation electronics, Electronics Technology, and Biomedical electronics), but that doesn't mean that I can tell you all about how resistors and capacitors are completely interchangeable because that is clearly not true.</p>

        <p>Actually, again, not true. Chicken pox is currently dormant in your system if you had it as a child. This virus is called varicella. And, actually, it causes shingles when activated from things like stress , age, or you guessed it, another virus like COVID 19. And guess what’s crazy? There’s a vaccine that is safe, effective for shingles!! Even if you had chicken pox as a child!! </p>
<p>Immunity is really complicated, and to paint it as a simple one size fits all, is just not true. I hope you’re getting that now more clearly. </p>
<p>What you describe vaccines to do (make you less infectious) is not the purpose. That would be a therapeutic vaccine to treat your infection. This is to prevent future infections. See the original comment! </p>
<p>Got it re: electronics. However, I was trained in immunology and infectious disease epidemiology. So, actually, this is what I was taught in school and currently am actively employed in. I don’t know what capacitors are either!</p>

        <p>Fine.  Link me a peer reviewed study PREDATING 2020 that shows extensive evidence (and I can read medical papers) that vaccines not only benefit someone who is already immune to a virus through natural exposure, but also makes them even more immune to said virus that they already fought off through natural exposure.  And you must also prove that viruses are still deadly and dangerous (same virus and strain) even after natural exposure in a way that is only combated by also taking a vaccine after the fact.</p>
<p>When and only when I review said paper that PREDATES 2020, will I retract my statement.  But ONLY after I have read such a paper.  And once I've read it, I'll work on my own to look up other articles and papers that back up the findings.</p>

        <p>So far, it’s only been tested on healthy adults 18-65, which is standard for a new vaccine. The Oxford vaccine I believe has just started testing on 12- 18 year olds. Likely it will be safe and effective on everyone, but always better to test it first!</p>

        <p>Correct. My comment was clearly stating that it’s only been proven on 18-65 and we need to wait for results on other groups. Science is wild man!</p>
