    <strong>A tyrannical, totalitarian government is just as deadly and hard to get rid of as any disease.</strong>
    <p><p>I had a conversation with a friend of mine. He and I usually agree on things, but he is very pro-vax and pro-mandates. We were talking about why I'm unvaxxed, and I think you guys would like my viewpoint:</p>
<p>Whether or not the vaccine is safe, I know it's wrong to "mandate" people's healthcare, their speech, what they can do on a day-to-day basis, and so on. Nevermind that Covid is not nearly as dangerous as some people think. Even if Covid was super crazy deadly, I don't support the government overstepping it's bounds and meddling with people's lives.</p>
<p>I served a church mission in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. During the 2 years I was there, I saw how people's freedoms, mental and spiritual health, and general standard of living had suffered under communism. Thankfully, they threw off the oppressive rule years ago, but I met thousands and thousands of people who were still wearing the scars of that time. Some people are still missing loved ones they lost to the oppressive regime.</p>
<p>I dont want anything like that in any country. And governments across the world are trying to grab power, using the fear of disease to control people. Hence my viewpoint: we should be just as wary of oppressive government as we should disease. Both can kill you, both are far-reaching...</p>
<p>But one of them is sentient and cunning, and can actively control its own spread.</p></p>

        <p>I might agree with the mandates if it was an incurable cholera outbreak and people were walking around with lhmph nodes the size of tennis balls. But yeah there is absolutely no need for this over reaction and again, I agree with you that the apparent Government actions (which increasingly looks like the start of a World Government, considering how all Governments seem to be doing the same and saying the same) are unprecedented and are a far greater threat long-term than any glorified cold virus.</p>

        <p>Same. The virus has a 99.9995% survival rate, and the "curve" has been flattened to pre-Arpil 2020 levels --which was the whole point of the restrictions and mandates. Yet, governments are re-introducing or doubling down on mandates despite the data, usually sold as a "precautionary" measure. No, it's an erosion of freedoms and (possibly) a test to see how far they can take it.</p>

        <p>Great post. I recently read Kundera's novel "Unbearable Lightness of Being" set during the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.</p>
<p>What people fail to grasp is that freedoms rarely disappear overnight; in almost every case it is a gradual erosion of freedoms (usually in the name of "security") until you've crossed an invisible line upon which it's almost impossible to go back.</p>
<p>With the concentration of 90% of media in the hands of six corporations and a public square (Social Media) that's already heavily policed and censored, the need for vigilance and healthy skepticism is more important than ever. Unfortunately it's the passivity of most people that makes me worried. Australia being a great example.</p>
