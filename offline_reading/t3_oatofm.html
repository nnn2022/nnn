    <strong>Could there be a link between aneurysm &amp; Covid vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>This week my uncle died from an aneurysm completely unexpectedly. AFAIK, he lived a pretty healthy lifestyle and had no known circulatory or health issues. His death came totally unexpected to anyone in our family.</p>
<p>My mother told me that he was "one of the first to get vaccinated", which makes me wonder if there could be a correlation.</p>
<p>Do you personally know any people who died unexpectedly from aneurysm?</p>
<p>Are you aware of any studies or articles that consider a possible link between aneurysm &amp; Covid-19 vaccines?</p></p>
