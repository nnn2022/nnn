    <strong>I hate the widespread use of masks</strong>
    <p><p>I just went to the store after more than 2 weeks of quarantine (I tested positive for covid) and I was shocked by the number of masks. I live in an area where masks haven't been to widespread but when I went in the store (it was a Kroger store) <em>every single person</em> was wearing one. I wasnt due to some health issues I have and I felt so uncomfortable. I didnt have a problem when half the people were wearing one but it was unnerving to see literally every single person wearing a mask.. some with face shield as well. I have anxiety which went through the roof because if this.. what I dont understand is why people feel the need to wear them? If I was still sick and I had to go out then sure, I would wear one. But when I'm healthy?? </p>
<p>Sorry if this seems like an unnecessary rant but I had to share and I felt this was ine of the few places I could.</p></p>

<p>So stupid.</p>
<p>I am legit seeing people wearing masks, face shields, gloves, and also safety glasses. Yes, all of the above, at once.</p>

        <p>We really do live in a clown world. I'm sure you can find a "doctor" who can give you a note the same way you can find one to let you get MMJ.</p>

        <p>I do have legit issues with masks but they are difficult to quantify. One is my anxiety. Having something on my face *does not* go over very well with that. But i doubt a doctor will write a note just because of bad anxiety. My second issue is they cause me physical pain.. Not sure how but anything on my face be it a mask, glasses, face shield, start to cause me pain after about 30 minutes of wearing it. I first discovered it when i was a kid and i had to wear glasses.</p>

        <p>I sont mind at all. And if enough people want me to I'll even make a post about it. So, I was tested like 3 or 4 times within a 2 week period because of my job. I work at an inpatient health facility that deals with people who are immunocompromised due to substance abuse. The last one tested positive. Just before the test I had been experiencing some nasal congestion which I chalked to allergies. That only lasted like 3 days or so. The only other symptom I experienced was muscle pain in my back. I <em>rarely</em> take any pills or anything but this was painful enough that I was taking ibuprofen like it was candy. Overall though I would say that the common cold was more severe</p>

        <p>The pain was definitely irregular though. I have a lot of back pain but this was entirely independent of what i was doing. 1st i had never hurt there before (it was just a different part of my back) and 2nd even when i was doing very little and not stressing my body it was hurting day in and day out. I do believe it was the virus that was doing it. Though ibuprofen *did* help quite a bit.. The nasal stuff could have been allergies but we may never know for sure.</p>

        <p>I 100% think I had covid before anyone knew it was in the US (due to circumstances, I’m almost certain of it) and this sounds exactly right. I had really bad joint pain in my hips and a general feeling of exhaustion. I also had the worst cough I’ve ever had in my life. But I got better like most people do.</p>

        <p>LOL are those the same tests that a papaya, a goat and some motor oil were "positive"?</p>
<p>The same ones that are now being reported that doctors are sending in unused tests that are coming back "positive" because doctors are getting suspicious?</p>
<p>The same tests that something like 300 labs in Florida were reporting a 100% positive rate?</p>

        <p>I've literally said to my SO "I've stopped thinking of them as human" both because they're covering up their unique human feature, but also because they're so unthinkingly dragging me along into their delusion that I don't care about them anymore. All sympathy I had at the beginning respecting people's fear is gone. They never respected me and how I felt. Fuck them.</p>

        <p>My area didn't have too many people wearing masks but now basically all stores started mandating mask so now I'm seeing them everywhere.  It is such a dystopian feeling and I hate going shopping now.</p>
<p>It dehumanizes people and it's hard to see them as our fellow citizens.  It's subtlety teaching everyone to be afraid of other people and to view them as disease vectors and not human beings.</p>
<p>Look around when you are out and you see people in their masks absolutely terrified of other people.  It's depressing and sort of sad.  I've always enjoyed shopping but now I hate going to any store. </p>
<p>And now places like Wal-Mart and Target are mandating masks with no mention of an end date.  It makes it feel more and more like this will never end.</p>

        <p>The main thing I worry about is being watched whenever I leave my own home due to a mask mandate everywhere in public.  I especially can’t stand wearing a mask while jogging/biking. Obviously it makes zero sense in warm weather, as it will just become a moist dirty cloth restricting your breathing in almost no time at all.</p>

        <p>That whole watching really hit home.. I got in an arguement with my roommate who thinks masks work. And while they CAN work with someone who knows how to use them properly they dont work in the general populace. I ended the debate when he said he believes the government should teach everyone how to use a mask and that there should be a punishment for those who dont..</p>

        <p>My family is Chinese, and my university has a large international student population from China. So...I expect to see Asians wearing masks, even when the deadliest disease going around is a stomach flu. However, I was shocked to see them on Americans, as early as March. I was even more surprised to see many Americans actively policing other members of the public for briefly taking off masks. I wear a mask in stores and crowded areas, but it’s hard to breathe under three layers of fabric or medical mask material for longer than an hour. </p>
<p>Some people have an irrational fear of the virus, and they feel like wearing a mask offers them protection. I think it’s largely a psychological need at this point.</p>

        <p>I feel similarly. Only for some reason, I can tolerate it at Walmart and the grocery store other than thinking how dystopian it all feels and wishing it would end.</p>
<p>There are certain things I just feel nervous about doing in a mask though. I haven't been able to bring myself to attend Mass because masks are required, and even our priest said he feels sad when he looks out in the congregation (which is really small in this new abnormal) and sees masked faces. I'm going ice skating on Tuesday and will have to wear a mask while skating and have a temperature check, and I LOVE skating, but now I'm dreading doing it in a mask. And one of the women I skate with is already whining "the hockey players don't wear masks under the tent; I wish it were more enforced!" The rink is under construction right now, though, so that's why we put our skates on in an outdoor tent. So there's not really many employees around, and I doubt they're going to assign someone to babysit and enforce that some 16-year-old hockey player wears a mask while putting his gear on. Why can't these judgmental cowards just keep themselves home if they can't handle seeing someone without a mask for less than five minutes in 90-degree heat? If she's that scared of COVID she doesn't need to be out ice skating.</p>
<p>I also hate the term "face covering" or ads that say "cover your nose and mouth." It just implies "You're disgusting" or "You're diseased" or "No one wants to see you."</p>

<p>If you've tested positive and have recovered, then in theory you're immune, so nothing to worry about. They'll probably use this idea to force immunity certificates soon, probably after the dreaded "second wave"</p>

        <p>From what I have seen in my job it <em>is</em> possible to get it again. We had a patient test positive then recover before entering the facility but, when randomly tested, tested positive again. At least the second time they were asymptomatic.</p>

        <p>False positives, most likely. This has been the case every time someone has "had it the second time". Usually it's because they have leftover virons that haven't left the body yet. It happens. </p>
<p>Getting it twice, and "zomg it's worse the second time" is bullshit. And like /u/s0rrybr0 wrote, if re-infection is the case then the vaccine should be worthless then. (Or will you guys just keep making up shit just to make this virus seem like the worst one ever?)</p>

        <p>I’m a little embarrassed but I spent a few minutes annoying a woman at the grocery store.  In produce, we attempted to enter the short, wide produce aisle at same time, from opposite ends.   Everyone wears masks bc it’s very mandated, and we were both small women who could have easily remained over 3’ apart. </p>
<p><em>Because</em> she kept making a big show of politely backing away (when we were still 15’ apart), I intentionally went into the aisles when she was about to.  Or I lingered once there.</p>
<p>Ended up getting fancy organic limes that I’m excited to make into ‘lemon-type brownie squares.  </p>
<p>It’s all weird...</p>

        <p>Lol.. Thank god i have never had someone back away from me very much.. I have noticed people keep distance slightly more than normal but its hardly noticeable. If i saw someone backing away from me even though we were more than 10 ft apart i would probably use that to antagonize them to. Its ridicules.</p>

        <p>I don't wear a mask on my outdoor walks.  The other day,a masked man was walking the other way on the trail.  He took one look at me and went well out of the way, probably staying at least 10 feet away.  I just shrugged and kept walking, but I couldn't  help snickering to myself about it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it used to be only 50% of people in places like Walmart etc were wearing masks. We now have a mask mandate. I went today and literally everyone was wearing a mask. BUT I did not wear a mask at all. Nobody stopped me. Nobody said anything to me. I just acted normal, didn’t try to crowd anyone, got what I needed and moved on. The only thing that happened was a lady asking me why I was buying so many bananas and I had a pleasant conversation about how I’ve been whole foods vegan for 7 years and how much it has changed my health. I think people actually tend to talk to me simply because they can see my face and want to socialize with someone who actually has a visible face. So far I’ve never had a confrontation and I’m not looking to start one, aka the whole not crowding people thing, but at the same time, I don’t act like I’m afraid of anything. It should be normal to not wear a mask and so that is how I act and live. On the rare occasion a door guard demands a mask at some store, I take the mask back off as soon as I’m past the door. They’ve got two choices: follow me around endlessly or ask me to leave. None of them seem keen to do that since no customers are complaining about me.</p>
<p>I think not crowding the scared ones goes a long way. The ones who aren’t scared won’t worry about keeping their distance. I also think in my area people are genuinely just terrified, rather than virtue signaling, even though we’ve only had 6 deaths in 4 months. But they watch the overdramatized news and can’t seem to observe the reality around them....</p>
<p>It sucks to see everyone in the stores etc with masks now. But so far the ice rink isn’t doing it and my workplace isn’t doing it. So I do get to see some human faces eventually. The mandate is universal, but some groups of people are just ignoring it.</p>

        <p>I get what you are saying.  Not a fan either.  But  a couple points here</p>
<p>&rt;  I wasnt due to some health issues I have </p>
<p>&rt;  But when I'm healthy??</p>
<p>I guess it's possible, but I can't think of a condition that would make it impossible to wear a mask and still represent myself as healthy.   A healthy person can wear a mask with no problems. If you don't want to wear a mask, own it.  Or don't represent yourself as "healthy".</p>
<p>&rt; If I was still sick and I had to go out then sure, I would wear one. But when I'm healthy??</p>
<p>Here you are simply denying the reason to wear masks.  It's because of asymptomatic transmission.  It is totally possible to spread while feeling "healthy".   If you don't believe that, again, just own it, but asking "why" just sounds uninformed.</p>
<p>I don't mean to come down so hard on you OP, but I think we have to be better than the doomers and use informed facts and logical reactions to win this thing.   Unless you tested negative on a second test after quarantine,  I might suggest that you are one of the relatively few people who really <em>should</em> be wearing a mask in public.</p>

        <p>First, I do have health issues. I have already shared what some were in other comments. The biggest one is my anxiety. Second, when I say I'm healthy I am referring to whether I'm sick or not. That doesn't cancel out my health issues. My health issues aren't transmittable. Third, there has been significant debate whether we need to worry about asymptomatic transmission. Health experts have been coming out and saying hey I guess it's not that big of a deal guys. To back this up at least anecdotally, I have stated in other comments that I work in a health facility. We had a patient test positive a second time but was asymptomatic. Through further testing though we found where the virus was and where it was spreading. Nobody who was near the asymptomatic carrier got sick. No social distancing, no masks. Where the virus did spread though was with symptomatic kitchen staff.</p>

<p>I'm confused.  To me in simple english if you have health issues that are transmittable, you are sick.   You
 tested positive.  14 days is a guideline, not a guarantee.  </p>
<p>I realize this sub is quite anti-mask.  If you have a transmissible condition, COVID or other, wearing a mask in public is just common sense.</p>

        <p>Depends on what the scale you put on "Vietnam" and how you view POWs, the generally agreed count is
https://www.archives.gov/research/military/vietnam-war/casualty-statistics</p>
<p>Those are all the broken numbers if you care about cause of death, race, religion, etc.</p>
<p>282k if you go with the Wikipedia number, and frankly with a .02% mortality in the subject population were the case (which, it isn't science exists and says that number is wrong in subsets of the age groups of schoolchildren)</p>
<p>Over 11,000 kids will die.</p>
<p>That is the fictionally low end. </p>
<p>The potentially similarly inflated high end, surpasses vietnam.</p>
<p>The hard likely numbers are looking to be around 64k, but that assumes perfect post-infection immunity, which isn't the case, so every three months we are looking at the potential for another crop of dead kids.</p>
<p>Darwinism is cool when you aren't the one being killed by it.</p>

        <p>&rt;  more kids will be killed back to school than soldiers were killed in Vietnam</p>
<p>Simple question, I will ask it again.  You have asserted that there is a number which is equal to the amount of soldiers that were killed in Vietnam.  Now, instead of rambling on about a bunch of other things ....... what is that number?</p>
