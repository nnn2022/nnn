    <strong>Democrats Toss Gretta Aside. Socialist morality now requires us to increase public funding to the massively greenhouse-gas emitting medical industry.</strong>
    <p><p>(I don't subscribe to the socialist proposals about climate-change, but I do believe pollution and overpopulation are serious problems.)</p>
<p>The medical industry is a massive emitter of pollution, including greenhouse gasses and toxins killing hundreds of thousands annually in the U.S.:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29072942/">Estimated Global Disease Burden From US Health Care Sector Greenhouse Gas Emissions - PubMed (nih.gov)</a> </p>
<p>But liberals have forgotten all about the environment and Gretta now; and that leaves no one addressing the medical industry's pollution.</p>
<p>When the U.S. FDA tells you the vaccine is "safe", the FDA means they counted the number of patients taking the medicine who got obviously hurt. The FDA doesn't count the people who will die in five years from pollution from the drug's manufacture. FDA doesn't mention the contribution climate change.</p>
<p>There's no scientific justification for the FDA to look away from the environment. They chose to define the word "safety" as they did; they didn't have to define it so narrowly. The FDA is doing bad science to the medical industry's financial benefit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when I've asked on Reddit, what are the FDA's scientific reasons for ignoring the medical industry's pollution, my questions have been censored on subreddits that are supposedly for climate concern. Even on the climate subreddits, the medical industry's financial interests control.</p></p>
