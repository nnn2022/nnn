<title>Coming up next: everything you do revolves around reducing CO2 emissions(or a disaster is going to strike you!), where flying is a luxury and god knows what else. Old normal wasnt perfect but this sounds like an eco fascist "utopia", full of "green shots" of change.</title>

    <p><p>See for yourself:  <a href="https://greatreset.com/">The Great Reset | Reset and shape the future</a> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong><em>From the website:</em></strong> </p>
<p>"The pause during lockdown created by the pandemic will result in a <em>7% decrease in global emissions in 2020</em>. The UN states that we need a decrease of 7.6% every year until 2030 to avoid climate and ecological disaster. This means we need to maintain the same decrease every year as if we were living in lockdown.</p>
<p>The challenge is that as we emerge from the pandemic the pressure to go back to ‘Business As Usual’ will intensify. But <em>people don’t want to go back</em>. Only 23%* of the UK public believe following lockdown, advertising should encourage people to consume, shop and fly like before lockdown. <em>77%* believe it is the industry’s responsibility to encourage people to behave more sustainably like during lockdown.</em></p>
<p><strong>Right now we have a small window of opportunity to reset and shape the future we want."</strong></p>
<p>"The Great Reset is a creative industry movement to embed the positive environmental shifts that have happened during lockdown as THE new normal.</p>
<p>Our industry has power and influence but we need lots of people to choose to use it. We must grab this opportunity to help shape a society that puts mankind and our planet’s needs first. To do this we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reset ourselves</strong> to become agents of change, not just passive receivers of briefs</li>
<li><strong>Reset our work</strong> so what we create promotes sustainable values, attitudes and behaviours.</li>
<li><strong>Reset our impact</strong> by reevaluating what we measure and celebrate as ‘success’"</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong><em>From their book:</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>"The pandemic is our immediate “in your face” reality, pressing upon us and presenting an opportunity for change. But simultaneously, we are vividly aware that we are in a climate and ecological emergency. Collaborative, urgent action for climate justice is needed and is long overdue. "</em></p>
<p>Did anybody else notice news articles in their countries suggesting we should use this "opportunity" to deal with the climate? I sure did. Since when is virology and climate change connected? Only in their plan...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>"Brands and businesses have a responsibility beyond profit and shareholders – to stakeholders – for their own impact on society and also to fill relevant gaps where governments cannot or do not. "</em></p>
<p>Sounds like a new excuse to tax private businesses. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>" To return to Business As Usual is not just to return to the past. To return to Business as Usual is to deliberately reject an open opportunity for our industry to fight the climate crisis. Who would want to do that? "</em> </p>
<p>See? Persuasion at work. They put you in a corner where you sound bad if you say "no". </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>"A discovered sense of wellbeing connecting to family, community and the local environment – more than half of the UK (56%) value “togetherness” more and 71% of Europeans are now in favour of a universal basic income."</em></p>
<p>UBI, again. Also sounds very "nice", but how is this truly going to work in practice? There is no free lunch in the world. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>"Top environmental problems are selfishness, greed and apathy."</em> </p>
<p>So wanting best for yourself now means youre out to get the environment. Enough with the guilt tripping...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>"Crises have a strange capacity for shifting our values. Around the world, we’ve seen Covid-19 transform hyper-competitive, individualist cultures into collaborative communities of citizens. Caring for vulnerable neighbours, making PPE at home, volunteering, observing new regulations for a greater good: these are perhaps not the kinds of behaviours we thought we had in us. "</em></p>
<p>Never let a good crisis...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And much more free eco goodies for every one of us, but check the booklet if youre interested,  I will barf if I keep on reading this eco crap nonsense. </p>
<p><strong>NO NEW NORMAL!</strong></p></p>

        <p>While the rich will still be free to fuck the planet as much as they damned well please. Like Prince Harry flying around in his little private jet back and forth from his plush bel air mansion. If he had an ounce of integrity he'd get a lift on a racing yacht like Greta!</p>

        <p>I saw a book written by their family in the bookshop today. It got me to thinking how fun their dinner table conversations must be, imagining them like dour 17th century Presbyterians, with their impassive Swedish faces, groaning about the sinful world being imminently consumed with hellfire. I kind of feel sorry for her, growing up in an environment (mo pun intended!) like that.</p>
