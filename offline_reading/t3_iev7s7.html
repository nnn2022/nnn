    <strong>Lockdowns are morally bankrupt, because they cost far more lives than they save. This is why.</strong>
    <p><p>I make the following assertions.  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Globally, lockdowns cause more far deaths than COVID-19.</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>In the US, far more years of life are lost to lockdown than to COVID-19.</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>We are not so far from herd immunity, with some states already have reached it.</strong>  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Lockdown deaths outweigh COVID-19 deaths globally.</h1>
<h2><em>And it’s not close.</em></h2>
<p>I’ll start with the easiest one to prove - global lockdown deaths outweighing COVID-19 deaths. As of today, there’s approximately ~807K COVID-19 deaths.  </p>

</ul>
<h1>Lockdowns cause drug overdoses and suicide, adding tens of thousands to the US death toll.</h1>
<p>Back in first world countries, lockdowns cause a number of second-order deaths.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Drug overdoses - <a href="https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20200822/studies-link-coronavirus-pandemic-to-rise-in-drug-overdoses">“Since states adopted stay-at-home orders, national opioid overdoses jumped 18% in March, 29% in April, and 42% in May, compared to the same months last year, according to federal government statistics.”</a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suicide - <a href="https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2020/08/11/pandemics-effect-on-already-rising-suicide-rates-heightens-worry/">“Cook County, Illinois, and Fresno, California, are among those reporting similar spikes, with suicides up 13% in Cook County so far compared with the same period last year. In Fresno, suicides were 70% higher in June than in the same month last year.”</a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Models are hard to get, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/05/04/mental-health-coronavirus/">one estimate which seems reasonable predicts 18,000 more suicides and 22,000 more overdoses</a>.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>COVID deaths steal <em>months.</em> Lockdown deaths steal <em>decades.</em></h1>
<ul>
<li>It’s hard to get exact figures on average age of suicide, but the rate is highest around ~50 years old and drug overdose at ~39 years old. By comparison, Neil Ferguson, the creator of the model that suggested we all lock down, estimates <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/25/two-thirds-patients-die-coronavirus-would-have-died-year-anyway/">2/3 of COVID-19 victims would have died this year</a>. The life expectancy of vast majority of COVID-19 victims is <em>months</em> if they had never had COVID-19, whereas those who are dying by suicide, overdose, etc probably could have expected <em>decades</em>.  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Lockdowns are killing many due to delayed health procedures.</h1>
<p>Hospitals all across the country shut down every elective procedure - which in medical jargon means "anything that isn't immediately life-threatening" thus almost every procedure. Only NYC got overwhelmed, and even that was due to poor logistics as the hospital ships were never filled.  </p>
<p>Plenty of elective procedures catch a condition at a treatable stage that if delayed for months becomes life-threatening. That causes additional deaths. <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(20)30388-0/fulltext">This article from Lancet</a> makes an estimate at how many lives these elective procedures cost.  </p>
<p>&rt; "Across the three different scenarios, compared with pre-pandemic figures, we estimate a 7·9–9·6% increase in the number of deaths due to breast cancer up to year 5 after diagnosis, corresponding to between 281 (95% CI 266–295) and 344 (329–358) additional deaths. For colorectal cancer, we estimate 1445 (1392–1591) to 1563 (1534–1592) additional deaths, a 15·3–16·6% increase; for lung cancer, 1235 (1220–1254) to 1372 (1343–1401) additional deaths, a 4·8–5·3% increase; and for oesophageal cancer, 330 (324–335) to 342 (336–348) additional deaths, 5·8–6·0% increase up to 5 years after diagnosis. For these four tumour types, these data correspond with 3291–3621 additional deaths across the scenarios within 5 years."  </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/932858">Here's an estimate of 10,000 deaths for the US version.</a>  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Lockdowns cause a spike in domestic abuse.</h1>
<p>Then there’s domestic abuse. It was such a serious issue it was brought up at Governor's Cuomo press conference. <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4871625/user-clip-bad-death">This clip of Cuomo speaking</a> is where the "XXX, very bad, not death" meme comes from.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2020/07/30/baltimore-sees-increase-in-domestic-violence-related-calls-during-covid-19-pandemic/">Baltimore Sees Increase In Domestic Violence-Related Calls During COVID-19 Pandemic</a>  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/in-remote-villages-domestic-violence-kills-more-than-covid-19">She Asked to Be Saved From Him. Now She’s Dead.</a> "During the pandemic, domestic violence has killed more people than COVID-19 in rural Alaska."  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Now you see why anti-lockdowners absolutely loathed Cuomo when he suddenly changed his mind and said it was ok for everyone to protest.). </p>
<h1>Lockdowns have not prevented deaths. Most people who would have died of COVID-19 have already died.</h1>
<p>Ok, what about a ceiling on deaths in a full-blown “everyone gets COVID-19” scenario?   </p>
<p>First, with vaccines, you need to inject about 60%-85% of random people in order to achieve herd immunity. I’m assuming that’s not in dispute.  </p>
<p>But, COVID-19 <strong>does not affect people randomly</strong>. <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160762v1">This paper</a> has an argument that COVID-19 organic spread results in “herd immunity thresholds around 10-20%, considerably lower than the minimum coverage needed to interrupt transmission by random vaccination.”   </p>
<p>The TL;DR of why is - a relatively small portion of people are in the “crossroads of life” so to speak. These are the superspreaders. But, the superspreaders are also the first to get infected - and by extension - first to become immune. This non-random distribution greatly lowers the herd immunity threshold.   </p>
<p>“OK, but this is all theoretical!” Look at how strikingly similar the <a href="https://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=states-normalized&amp;highlight=New%20York&amp;show=us-states&amp;y=highlight&amp;scale=linear&amp;data=cases-daily-7&amp;data-source=jhu&amp;xaxis=right&amp;extra=Florida%2CArizona%2CTexas#states-normalized">graphs of NY, AZ, FL, TX are</a> - TX is less clean because unlike the other states it’s not a single metropolis. <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-map-coronavirus-antibody-testing-data-date">NYC has 26% antibody seroprevalence</a> and virtually no new COVID-19 cases. FL is estimated at <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/editorspicks/article/California-coronavirus-COVID-19-herd-immunity-how-15469055.php">21%</a> having had COVID-19. <a href="https://covid19-projections.com/us-az">AZ</a> at 22%, <a href="https://covid19-projections.com/us-tx">TX</a> at 21%.  </p>
<p>You might argue this is all seasonal, but here’s perhaps the greatest piece of circumstantial evidence that the low herd immunity threshold is real: Louisiana. Louisiana is directly in the middle of Florida and Texas. Despite being functionally identical, and also being a FL/NY/AZ-type metro-state, LA never exhibited the same peaks. But, they did have a mini-surge all the way back in March due to Mardi Gras. <a href="https://twitter.com/boriquagato/status/1295716257673641984">This thread explains the significance of LA for herd immunity</a>.  </p>
<p>What is the final death rate, once COVID-19 has ripped through? Well, we are only a little over 60% to reaching universal 20% seroprevalence, which means we have about 20MM cases “to go.” The highest death rates were in the <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">New England states</a>. If we take the death rate of recent surge states, we come with approximately “more” 50K deaths to go in the US. As callous as it sounds, 250K deaths, primarily in people who had less than one year to live, is a lot less than the predicted global lockdown deaths, and a lot fewer years of lives estimated to be lost to lockdowns.</p></p>

        <p>I think the vaccines are a red herring. It was their initial goalpost, but now that it is actually achievable, they’re downplaying the vaccines big time.  </p>
<p>I’m of the opinion that lockdowns started as a CCP plot, but now there is no end goal except an emotionally-driven subjugation of the “other tribe.” It is the Stanford Prisoner Experiment gone global. The end result is tyranny and ashes.</p>

        <p>Exactly! They used Covid to instill even more fear into the public. If they outright killed people then 'they' would never be trusted. So they release a virus that 99% survive but sell us fearporn 24x7 to raise the fear and anxiety that cause us to infight about wearing masks, lockdowns, and killing granny if we don't obey.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this, after 5months of lockdown my body is feeling so weak, I exercise and eat healthy but my body is just rejecting everything, I barely sleep, I have no appetite, I don't have motivation to do anything. my hands are shaking since this morning. I will break the Victorian rules today and go out for more than an hour, but I have done this almost everyday nothing really helps. I can't imagine people without a proper structure and with already health issues how can they cope and survive?
I'll be fine, I have absolutely no other issue than the lockdown and still have a job but this is impacting me so harshly and all I can hear is I shouldn't complain it's for saving grandma and grandpa while I know that all these consequences will be worse and the world doesn't seem to be listening!</p>
<p>This sub with lockdown scepticism, Tom Woods and a few libertarians are the only people I can listen to nowadays...

I'm pissed off and feel I write in to the void with my elected officials. 
They write back and say "we're successfully flattening the curve", with no self reflection.</p>

        <p>The big one is the people avoiding healthcare altogether out of fear. Millions of people have avoided cancer treatment and cancer screening during the lockdowns. Tens of thousands of stroke and heart attack victims didn’t call an ambulance. All of these negative effects are well- documented at this point and will result in way more life years lost than covid. </p>
<p>This isn’t even to mention deaths occurring from neglect. Sadly, there’s a ton of people in our society that need to be checked up on a regular basis by other human beings. Who knows how many elderly and mentally ill people have died alone in their homes simply because society locked down. </p>
<p>I suspect an even greater number of people will die from the economic fallout and limitations on international trade. Mostly children in economically disadvantaged countries. </p>
<p>Anyone advocating for “the greater good” should be strongly anti lockdown. I don’t even thing there’s an argument to be made anymore. Lockdowns cause far more harm than good.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns are stupid. We never should have done the first one. But why are we still arguing over this? We’re not in lockdown nor are we going to have another one. </p>
<p>You know what else drives up non-COVID deaths? Full hospitals, which were just coming off of in SC/GA. People also don’t go to the hospital when COVID  spikes are in the news, so those delays also cause excess deaths. </p>
<p>I’ve never understood the aversion to masks. That’s the one thing that would allow us to walk the line between an open economy and not overwhelming the healthcare system.</p>

        <p>There is a lot of continuum between “welded inside our homes” and “fully reopened.”  Colleges aren’t open, churches aren’t open, restaurants are allowed nowhere near what they need to make a profit, we aren’t allowed weddings or funerals, etc. </p>
<p>So yes with the exception of South Dakota, we are still locked down. Get off the mask high horse.</p>

        <p>Yep, anecdotal isolated hospitals running out of ICU. They’ll go the exact same way FL, AZ, etc did.  </p>
<p>My wife and I both got COVID while masking, at the exact same time. While I’m loosely in favor of masking, it isn’t the panacea you seem to think it is, and I’m proof why.  </p>
<p>There was a poster who spammed a bunch of citations about how good the masks are, and the firmest number he had was 2% reduction in case growth while masking. That’s not nothing but that’s not amazing either.  </p>
<p>I think the whole argument over masking is a red herring just like vaccines because 100% compliance is impossible to achieve, so it gets used as a tool to dunk on the other tribe to blame them for where we’re now... kind of like what you’re doing now.</p>

        <p>I work in medical sales and visit about half the hospitals in GA. I saw it with my own eyes. COVID units filling up and spilling patients into other units. The units those patients normally treat get pushed out. It’s much better now so I’ll agree with you that it’s gone the way the FL/TX/AZ has, but there’s a negative effect on non-COVID disease states when that happens. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.wfxg.com/story/42496132/new-data-suggests-wearing-a-mask-works">The data out of SC suggest that masks work. </a></p>
<p>We’re you and your wife wearing N95s or certified KN95s? I agree that nothing is 100% but I’ll take anything that helps. For the record, I’m not planning on getting the Covid vaccine. It was rushed. No thanks. </p>
<p>I’m not meaning to dunk on the other tribe. I’m neither “let’s do nothing” or “let’s lockdown if it saves even 1 life.” I was against the lockdown before it started. If we were going to eradicate the disease, then maybe it’s worth the cost. If not, it’s a complete waste of money. We just delayed the inevitable and added $7T to the national debt.</p>

        <p>Just checked GA and SC - cases are past the peak, so hopefully you should start seeing an unwinding in ICU occupancy any day now like FL/AZ is.  </p>
<p>We got COVID on a road trip. The destination we were at was extremely strict on social distancing and mask enforcement and hygiene. The resort handed out new surgical masks at every entrance so that’s what we wore. </p>
<p>The one time that social distancing was violated was when we were walking on streets, alone, outdoors and sunny, and then a BLM protest came up from behind us and surrounded us for about 15 minutes. We were slower and not able to “dodge” because we were with our 3 young kids. About 75% were masked but they were shouting through the masks right into our faces. They looked about 20 years old so I doubt they had any symptoms (I’m 46). Exactly 5 days later our symptoms appeared at the same time.  </p>
<p>I’m fine with masking <em>if it means a full reopening</em> - my kids going back to school, we get go to church, etc, but nothing short of that. I think it’s fairly unrealistic to blame the 20% or so that will not mask, especially among the college and social cohort. I just don’t see much of a difference between socializing in close contact while masking vs not masking.</p>

<p>We have. One of the advantages of what I do is I can see that first hand. Overflow ICUs have drained their COVID patients pretty fast so that’s a great sign and everyone is encouraged. </p>
