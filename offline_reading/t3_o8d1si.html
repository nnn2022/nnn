    <strong>I got fired today for refusing to weak a mask.</strong>
    <p><p>I don't ever really post on here but I'm pretty upset about this so I decided I'd write this down and share with all of you. My company requires all unvaccinated employees to wear masks at all times, while vaccinated employees are free to go maskless. </p>
<p>Like most of you, I've been extremely adamant about not taking this vaccine. The mask mandates in my state have been lifted and I'm an extremely healthy 22 year-old male. The evidence for the efficacy of masks is inconclusive at best. I told them that I was respectfully declining to adhere with this policy. As far as I know, I'm the only employee in the company to do this.</p>
<p>I was let go today for my decision. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I'm in a situation where I can afford to lose my job but I feel terrible for the employees who can't. It's unclear if I'll be able to get unemployment, but I might finally just use this as an excuse to move out of California all together. I'm pretty upset right now. I was a very good employee and I've never been fired before. </p>
<p>Sorry if this post isn't relevant or allowed. I just wanted to write this down.</p></p>

        <p>Good job! I know it seems shitty, but you did what 99% of society is too afraid to do: you stuck to your values and ideals despite pushback. That's called integrity. Sorry you're outta work, but you did more important work standing up for yourself (thus the rest of us) than any "job" I can think of.</p>
