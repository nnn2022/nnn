    <strong>I didn't know anyone with Covid for over a year</strong>
    <p><p>If it is so dangerous and so widespread, just why I never knew anyone with Covid or had any symptoms in my entire social circle for over a year. And the first person that I did, was someone I knew from social media, not even in real life. </p>
<p>And here we are, still effectively in lockdown and doing safe distancing for a virus so dangerous that we have to test to know that we have it.</p></p>

        <p>Testing positive and having symptoms I believe are two different things and quite honestly the asymptomatic label just means someone is healthy and they might have had it at one point but their immune system did its job, it's kind of a ridiculous thing to still be testing for folks with no symptoms, if it's to drive the numbers up with false positives then they are doing it alright</p>

        <p>There are to types of tests: The normal ones and the fast tests</p>
<p>The fast test checks if there has ever been an infection, it could be now, it could also be from weeks ago. If the fast test is positive you also have to do a normal one to make sure if you have covid right now.</p>

        <p>I've heard of both tests and know there is a high threshold of false positives considering how sensitive it is and how high the cycle threshold is set at, never taken either test and no desire to either</p>

        <p>There is a high threshold of false positives for fast tests because it tests if you have ever been infected. Also, you don't need to take a test if you show no symptoms but please do if you show some.</p>

        <p>If they want to crate false statistics, why even to actual tests? They could just say "Yeah, we did 100,000 test and 50% were positive so yeah" but they don't. However I am done arguing, I already have some sort of slow mode on me where I can only write a comment every 15 minutes so it's hard arguing. I guess the mods can't handle someone arguing without insulting people and don't know what to do.<br>
I will keep believing in our medicine as I know for a fact that they know more about the topic than I do</p>

        <p>I personally have known of three.  My daughter currently, says like mild allergies though she can't taste anything, feels fine.  A niece, hardly any symptoms at all.  And an aunt who has had multiple health problems and did require hospitalization for low oxygen.</p>
<p>Saying that, yes I do believe it's been way overblown.  My aunt requiring hospitilization has been in and out of one for a few years now for other unrelated issues and I honestly feel she was convenietly labeled covid (per financial incentives by the institution).  My daughter and niece were pretty ticked off to be required in isolation from their job over very mild sniffles.</p>
<p>For the majority of people it's nothing major at all and the lockdowns and mandates are just delaying it's course, let it sweep through the majority and be done with it.  The compromised should do what they can to limit their exposure until the majority has reached herd immunity.  Just my opinion.</p>

        <p>I know a few people that had it. No one had any serious problems, other than my chick losing hair for about a month after she recovered. Luckily she has plenty to spare. Still a strange side effect. </p>
<p>I had it but was asymptomatic. </p>
<p>That's it. No one died or was even seriously ill.</p>

        <p>People don’t even know half the time that they do, they just say they tested positive. Which, as we’ve seen, does not necessarily mean clinical infection, which has likely been the case many times.</p>

        <p>I know of two people. One at work and one a personal acquaintance.  Both said it was very mild, in fact said they had past cases of the flu that were many times worse.  They are both in the 30 to 50 year old age group. Relatively healthy, and normal.</p>

        <p>My business involved tourism. So me and my employees encountered cruise ships, tour groups, families, locals, etc. thousands of them every day.</p>
<p>I was a bar hopper and sat and drank with and talked to hundreds while this was supposedly raging.</p>
<p>None of my employees got sick. No one I know from the bars got sick. None of my friends got sick. I had a fever and what felt like the flu for two days back in January.</p>

        <p>It went through our crew in February in Seattle.  A couple guys got mildly sick, 2-3 day colds, a third guy got pretty sick for a couple weeks (this same guy seems to get hit hard when he gets sick - once a year he’s down for a week or two, so this wasn’t abnormal for him.)  The other 4 of us didn’t get it despite me taking care of them pretty closely, in their rooms with the chicken soup touching their poor lil heads n whatnot.  I tested neg for antibodies in May.</p>
<p>The guy that got sickest went to see his parents in early March and gave it to them 😆 his mom was a healthcare worker and tested positive, but asymptatic.  Dad was sick for a week... and that’s when the lockdowns hit us.</p>
<p>We all just kinda collectively shrugged, realizing we already were exposed to The Thing so we carried on like normal.</p>
<p>This was Seattle where cases were first detected so my theory is the virus blew through here in Feb and no one noticed.  A know a ton of people who were sick then.  But WA been patting themselves on the back for having low case counts 🙄 cos you know, we’re so good with masks and social distancing.</p>

        <p>I know two people that got it. An acquaintance about 40 years old, who got over it no issue. Second, my mother who's 71. My mom spiked to 102, and had some breathing issues, but never got to the point of needing to go to the hospital and is well on her way to full recovery.</p>
<p>The fact that I know two is a statistical anomaly. The fact that they both survived is not.</p>

        <p>The virus discriminately attacks those that are scared of it. Kind of like dogs. The virus can sense your fear. Ask a normal person how many they know and they may say like 1 or 2. Ask a douchebag manipulative liberal, and they all know 87 cases, 31 deaths, including a baby</p>

        <p>Because there’s no such thing? Flu cases are down 98% though.</p>
<p>Imagine if they could convince the entire world that there was a dangerous new virus out and you needed a special test to know if you had it.</p>
<p>They’ve renamed the flu to covid. They’re likely testing for adenoviruses, which there a lot of and have a broad range of symptoms.</p>
<p>I imagine it all has to do with getting dna samples of everyone during testing, so that they can then create a real virus to release later, maybe in 2030. They’ll design it so it takes out a large and predetermined population of people. It’ll be rapidly spreading, and actually deadly to over 25% of the population. What’s happening now is the “exercise” to get the groundwork ready for the great collapse that they’re working towards.</p>
<p>The cyber pandemic is next. The so-called Russian hack. They’ll take out the power and internet. They’ll bring back power but say the internet is unsafe (because they need to censor it) and that will be the end of that. After there will be a climate crisis as we enter a solar minimum and it becomes difficult to farm...around 2024.</p>
<p>It’s going to get interesting...</p>

        <p>Frogs have excellent night vision and are very sensitive to movement. The bulging eyes of most frogs allow them to see in front, to the sides, and partially behind them. When a frog swallows food, it pulls its eyes down into the roof of its mouth, to help push the food down its throat.</p>

        <p>I had symptoms and tested positive, initially disregarded it as what I thought to be usual seasonal allergy type symptoms with mild heat stroke from exercising outdoors (late July). Despite not figuring it out until a few days into sickness, no one else in my household or social circle had symptoms that warranted being tested, or tested positive when they did so for safe measure (only myself symptomatic out of 10 close contacts). Something tells me its not as infectious as previously stated, or more people were already sick with it during Jan to March last year, or already somewhat immune because of prior similar coronavirus exposure throughout their lives.</p>
