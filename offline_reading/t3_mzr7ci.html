        <p>When you take the vaccine, you automatically put yourself in the side effect pool. When you don't, someone doesn't immediately come by and cough covid in your face.  There's the third possiblity that you neither contract covid, nor take the vaccine and remain symptom and side effect free.</p>
<p>It is worse to make a healthy person sick for no reason, then to get sick from a virus they were probably going to survive anyhow.</p>
<p>The side effect I'm most terrified about is a 10-15% occurrence though.  I wouldn't play russian roulette for a chance to win a million dollars, even if I had the 90% survival chance.</p>

        <p>Not bad, if that is the number, but a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>All covid deaths were counted, not just those directly attributable to covid,  ut even gunshot victims. This "rare" clot isn't even being directly attributed to the vaccine</li>
<li>Lot's of deaths following the vaccine in healthy people have died and been called "natural deaths"</li>
<li>Age of victim. In a Swedish study, they found that 70% of victims (they hadn't checked the rest) had between 5 and 9 months to live. I've seen at least 4 cases of babies likely dying from the vaccine, among the cases that actually made it public. So, 1 vaccine victim may lose far far more life expectancy than a covid victim.</li>
</ol>
<p>You say 1 in 533,333, but the number of people who have actually had covid is far greater than recorded. The method of recording deaths is inconsistent, greatly exaggerating covid deaths while burying vaccine deaths. Ao, your 1 in 533,333 is meaningless.</p>

        <p>We can calculate all day, the two of us follow different premises on what correlation and causation is, it's meaningless.</p>
<p>But if you're right, I'm sure we will see a fuckton of excess mortality or hospitalisations from administering the vaccines. If we don't, you'll be proven wrong, because we saw excess mortality due to covid.</p>

        <p>Ah, yes, like DMX, Vivek, and those three severe cases that the BC doctor blew the whistle on...</p>
<p>Oh wait, they said those were not caused by the vaccine, because.... the vaccine doesn't do that... even though it was predicted to do that, they took it and it did what it was predicted to do.</p>
<p>But, those won't be "excess mortality or hospitalisations from administering the vaccines".</p>
<p>Funny, eh? Every single death was a covid death but no deaths are vaccine deaths?</p>

        <p>Not every single death was a covid death, no, I also heard of cases where it's dubious. Same skepticism should go for alleged vaccine related side effects or deaths. I saw what people report for vaccine side-effects, it's ridiculous. And almost all of it is still preferable to death.</p>
<p>The filling of the ICUs and the excess mortality in the thousands prove however that covid kills people in numbers that absolutely dwarf vaccine-side effects in severity and number. It's not even close. If you can't prove an effect that's remotely similiar, the vaccine is a much better choice for society. I'll take blood clots with chances in 1:100'000 that don't kill people over excess mortality in the thousands any day.</p>

        <p>Every single case was a covid death, according to the official definition.</p>
<p>\&rt;The filling of the ICUs and the excess mortality in the thousands prove however that covid kills people in numbers</p>
<p>Except when they find that half the people in ICU for covid...caught covid in ICU, they were there for other reasons.</p>
<p>And then you have the "excess mortality in the 1000s", which is a vague and meaningless statement. What makes it more meaningless is that the deaths are determined by folks getting a bonus for covid deaths and they are determining the deaths according to a bullshit definition that you nor anyone else would accept for vaccines.</p>
<p>So, you are not presenting anything of use.</p>

        <p>Ah, so people who get covid in the ICU suddenly duplicate and make the ICU fuller.</p>
<p>It's a fact that with rising cases and hospitalisations, the ICUs get fuller.</p>
<p>It's actually not vague in the slightest, since official overall death counts for countries are available and analysed. If thousands more people died in 2020 than would have been expected, it's relatively clear that the virus kills thousands of people. Except you're suggesting that by coincidence, a magical other factor is killing people and somehow coincides everytime the cases, hospitalisations and ICU patients go up.</p>
<p>And I don't have any amount of goodwill to see my treatment compromised if I have an accident, a tumor or whatever because they had to postpone Operations because antivaxxers are clogging the hospitals again in the future.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>\&rt;since official overall death counts for countries are available and analysed</p>
<p>Yes, and in the US, 6% of covid deaths are for covid alone and yet the other 94% also show up everywhere that records deaths as covid deaths.</p>
<p>Apart from the CDC distinguishing between covid deaths, where else can I find the records? For Canada, for example?</p>
<p>\&rt;Except you're suggesting that by coincidence, a magical other factor is killing people</p>
<p>No magic involved, just definitions. If you say the definition of a covid death is "anyone who dies within 28 days of a positive covid test" and you test every victim, then you will have numbers, not magic.</p>
<p>This may be hard for you to understand: people die.</p>
<p>If you are between 0 - 19 years old in Canada, then annually, 3,065 of you will have died from 2014-2019 on average.</p>
<p>Per 28 days that would be (3065/365)*28= 235</p>
<p>So, statistically, in a 28 day period, 235 0 - 19 years will die.</p>
<p>What percent of 0 - 19 year old got covid in Canada?</p>
<p>Let's see. From 2014 - 2019, the average number of 0 -19 year olds in Canada were 8,057,115. How many have tested positive to date?</p>
<p>208,195 positive covid cases to date among 0 - 19 year olds in Canada.</p>
<p>Now, will the definition of a covid death cover these cases or not? That is, are these deaths actually caused by covid or merely by the definition of a covid death?</p>
<p>Average number of deaths per 28 day period among 0 - 19 year olds is 235, or:</p>
<p>235 deaths/ 8,057,115 0 - 19 year olds = 0.00002916676</p>
<p>208,195 covid cases among 0 - 19 year olds * the chance a 0 -19 year old will die in a 28 day period 0.00002916676</p>
<p>= 6</p>
<p>The official number is 8. So, 6 of 8 covid deaths among 0 - 18 year olds are by definition only.</p>
<p>In fact, Canadian politicians and media recently celebrated the death of a 13 year old girl because she was the first kind of clear death from covid in a child in Canada. She was vastly overweight and got no medical treatment, but hey, finally a legitimate victim...</p>
<p>\&rt; And I don't have any amount of goodwill to see my treatment compromised if I have an accident</p>
<p>We have not done cancer screening in a year in Canada, so eat a dick you fuckface.</p>

        <p>I'm talking about excess mortality to exactly adress the point you're making.
If in Country XY, normally around 100k people die and in 2020 it was 120k, you can throw a tantrum about what was covid and what was just the definition, the fact is, 20k more people died than what was expected if the year would have went normally. That's what I mean, unless there is some other factor that just kills people, it safe to assume it was the coronavirus, seeing as how hospitals always fill up when cases go up.</p>
<p>The definition on what death was WITH or BECAUSE of a corona-positive test doesn't matter when looking at the fact that since the pandemic, in absolute numbers, thousands more people die than what would be normal.</p>
<p>Exactly, no cancer screening for a year. That's why antivaxxers will be restricted in some countries (when cases go up again), because if they clog the hospitals because they were too stupid to get the vaccine, people that did everything right are suffering because of it.</p>

        <p>Who is going to check "excess mortality"?</p>
<p>Ah, the same people who created the definition that any death is a covid death within 28 days of a positive test.</p>
<p>Ah, the same people, who when a doctor comes forward and says I had 3 severe reactions to the vaccine, tell him that they can't take his claims seriously, since vaccines don't cause adverse reactions and therefore they will not investigate.</p>
<p>Ah, those people will be counting. And how can we check? Just like you said we can check the deaths, (we can't), who and how will folks confirm that the excess deaths were covid?</p>
<p>\&rt;The definition on what death was WITH or BECAUSE of a corona-positive test doesn't matter </p>
<p>If it doesn't matter, shouldn't it at least be consistent? Shouldn't any death within 28 days of a vaccine be labelled a vaccine death? </p>
<p>\&rt;since the pandemic, in absolute numbers, thousands more people die than what would be normal.</p>
<p>Ah, circular reasoning, wonderful. Pandemics kill lots of people. Covid is a pandemic. Covid has killed lots of people How do we know covid has killed lots of people. Because, it's a pandemic and pandemics kill lots of people. </p>
<p>Bravo!</p>
<p>\&rt;Exactly, no cancer screening for a year.</p>
<p>Didn't happen with any other pandemic, why this one? So, take credit for those deaths, and I will take credit for anti-vaxxers deaths.</p>
<p>\&rt;if they clog the hospitals because they were too stupid to get the vaccine</p>
<p>So, the WHO had said that based on seroprevalence studies, around 750m people had had covid as of Oct 2020. Assuming it has doubled by now and 20% have had covid, and 50% of people don't get the vaccine "anti-vax" (but most of these are fully vaccinated and are just choosing to let the guinea pigs be the research subjects on an untested experimental drug). Of the 50% of people remaining, 20% of them will have had covid, so 60% of the population is covered.</p>
<p>If you say herd immunity is achieved at 70%, then 10% more of the population would need to get infected to reach it. If we look at the number of deaths  to reach 10% seroprevalence, they were 1m. </p>
<p>These 1m were from the earliest point of covid and we have been able to reduce the risk of death by 85% since then. </p>
<p>So, if you are asking if it would be better to just open at 50% vaccinated and allow 150k 80 year olds in poor health to die over the course of the year across the entire world, so, you know, they don't clog up hospitals 2 months later with a different illness, vs kill 2 year olds with an injection for a disease they were not at risk at and watch a 20% drop in the birthrate, then yes, any non-idiot would say it is a good idea.</p>

        <p>You haven't provided any, remember? You said pandemics kill people, so therefore covid kills people, voila!</p>
<p>You have not given a number for how many people die from covid and you haven't given a number for how many die from the vaccine and you haven't given a consistent way to distinguish and ascribe each death.</p>
<p>I have told you what the government's definition is. I have told you how many cases and how many cases are mathematically guaranteed by the government's definition and the government will openly tell this to you.</p>
<p>I have told you how they have avoided counting deaths as vaccine deaths.</p>
<p>I have provided lots of numbers and actual on-going definitions. You have not.</p>
<p>Since you have given no numbers, I had none to ignore. You have chosen to ignore the numbers I have provided, all from government sources. So, you demand folks listen to the government, but not listen to the government. You ignore numbers and then say others are doing it. You are ignorant of the definitions and think others are.
