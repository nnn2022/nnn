        <p>So far, Canada has had around 25,000 deaths from covid.  About 15,000 in 2020.</p>
<p>That same year, 2020, Canada also performed 85,000 abortions.</p>
<p>That number is actually down from its peak of around 100,000 abortions a year in 2017.</p>
<p>We've closed down the entire economy and completely altered our way of life because of around 15,000 deaths in the elderly, while at the same time killing four times the amount of unborn babies every single year.</p>
<p>I'm not Pro Life by any means.  But that is messed up.</p>
<p>Feel free to look at those stats if you want.  They are accurate.</p>

        <p>I do believe it should be more difficult to get an abortion in Canada.  </p>
<p>And learning there are nearly 100,000 abortions performed in Canada a year is a little bit staggering.  </p>
<p>I just don't have a super strong opinion in either direction.  There is one major battle I am fighting right now against lockdowns, masks, vaccinations, and the globalist threat of an authoritarian police state.  My focus is more on that at the moment.</p>

        <p>I love injecting my position on abortion because it's such a shitty idea to consider normalized. Just merely a lie effect of people using sex solely for pleasure. Then guess what happens, accidents. When something meant for procreation has instead become a video game or drug addiction, you get this happening. Both men and woman buy into it. Celibacy isn't a weakness, it's a strength. Socially, you'd be ostracized for having such a view point. Good riddance. Better than pretending pad hopping is conducive to stability in the long run.</p>
<p>Close your legs, you won't have that issue. Better yet, understand how psychologically manipulated you'd become to be a sex object. It's not fun nor easy but it's freeing. From pornograpy to Tinder, it's all there to make you feel lost. People have effectively been not taught to be conscientious. Of course, because an accidental birth just means another slave for societies machine.</p>

        <p>i would say, that a clearer argument can be made:</p>
<p>&rt;the same people, that murder and paralyze children through poison injection tell you, that you are selfish if you don't take their latest poison injection.</p>

        <p>both are valid points to be brought up, but i would only use the abortion point, when i know i'd be dealing with someone, who is strongly against abortion.</p>
<p>well even better, if they understand that planned parenthood is basically an arm of the eugenics movement, but if they already understand what the eugenics movement is and that it never ended, then it is unlikely, that they would not already be aware, that these are eugenics poison injections.</p>
<p>but yeah if you talk to a random person you want to avoid any and all potential side tracking and paralyzing and murdering children, that are a few years old is much clearer in that regard to get and there is no debate at all.</p>
<p>there are already enough tripwires setup to derail conversations and create specific reactions in the programmed slaves, so i would try to minimize triggering those as much as possible.</p>
<p>oh btw,  when trying to make the argument, that the same people, who are pushing these poison injections are the same people, who "murder" unborn babies/fetuses, one should ad the point about aborted fetus tissue in vaccines as this builds on the point and may be even more effective on any religious person.</p>

        <p>Im not saying i disagree with you, because i also find it hypocritical and inconsistent on a moral and ethical level, but i can tell you that a ready rebuttal would probably be something like "my abortion doesnt make other people have abortions." Or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Like i said, i agree with you, but i have to play devils advocate when i consider something, if for no other reason than putting myself in their shoes and knowing where the other person may go with their argument.  And i can definitely see someone going that route.</p>

        <p>I completely agree with you on that point, so please dont think im actually rebutting your argument.  I personally wont do the mental gymnastics required to try and rationalize those contradicting ideas. If its "my body my choice", then that replies to all aspects of the individual (even more than abortion in this case, if im be honest). Im just relaying where i think they might go in an argument, considering that moral and ethical consistency doesnt seem to be a strong point for many people.</p>

        <p>An embryo is not a baby. And that baby has no right to live off of someone else's body, leaching nutrients from their bones (pregnancy is a major reason women get frailer in old age than men, pregnancy contributes immensely to osteoporosis) without the host's consent. And no, consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy because no legal contract can be made between a woman and a non-existent entity. That being the egg that was not even fertilised yet when the woman agreed to sex.
As someone who worked in an IVF clinic for some time and handled many discarded embryos and looked at many ultrasounds... I just roll my eyes at anyone who says abortion is killing babies. Most abortions happen in the first trimester. That is so early in development that the zygote/embryo doesn't even have a functioning brain by any stretch of the imagination. Which means it has never been alive or even sentient and can't feel pain. No one is being hurt when a woman aborts in the first trimester. But it hurts my feelings and the feelings of many other women when you say we should not have the right to prevent bodily harm to ourselves in continuing to host another organism growing inside of us at our expense. Bodily harm being osteoporosis, permanent incontinence, tearing, gestational diabetes, scarring, etc. You can go look up "complications from pregnancy" if you want to know exactly how hard pregnancy is on women's bodies and how is permanently makes a woman more vulnerable to illness and injury. And not to mention, the financial and social consequences of being forced to give birth against one's will. Some of us would like to not be single moms who have to quit college and start working minimum wage to support a baby we didn't even want, and giving birth to a baby and then sending it into the "system" is very cruel if you know what many of those children are used for by our dear leaders. </p>
<p>Obviously late term abortions are getting closer to "killing a baby" but they account for such a small percentage of abortions and are overwhelmingly done when the child is severely disabled.</p>
<p>But honestly. You know what? The reason doesn't matter. If a woman doesn't want to host another person inside of her, too bad for that person. It doesn't get to parasite off of her when she wants it out. Curse you and anyone else who thinks it's morally right to tell a person they don't get absolute control over who or what gets to be inside their body (nevermind who gets who feed off their body like a parasite, leaving permanent damage in their wake)</p>
<p>Bodily autonomy is sacred. It is when it comes to vaccines or any other medical procedure. And it is when it comes to abortion. Remember. The argument the Pro-forced-vaxxers are using to force you to get vaxxed is that your bodily autonomy can be stripped away from you to prevent other people from dying. That is no different to your argument that bodily autonomy should be stripped away from pregnant women so that someone else won't die. We do not have a duty to take a vaccine to prevent other people from dying. We do not have a duty to host other people inside of us who feed off of our bodies to stop that person from dying. Anything you try to say to disagree with abortion rights is simply undermining bodily autonomy for people who don't want the vaccine. They're the same thing. Whether you like it or not. All you have to do now is answer, is it EVER OK to force someone to do something with his or her body that they do not consent to? Is rape ever OK? Is forced vaccination OK? Is forced pregnancy ever OK? My answer to all three is no. What's yours?</p>
