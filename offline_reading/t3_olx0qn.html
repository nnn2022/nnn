        <p>Actually, according to official data it's the vaxxed that are many times more likely to die to the delta variant than the unvaxxed:</p>

<p>And even in groups where everyone is fully vaxxed, covid still spreads like wildfire:</p>

        <p>The article makes a first mistake of adding up all vaccinated cases (37k) and then comapres it to number of unvaccinated cases (71k) and then says that vaccinated outnumber the unvaccinated. But I'll assume the author just made a mistake there.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the most glaring problem is that the author doesn't take into account one vital fact, what part of the general population is unvaccinated vs what part of population is vaccinated.</p>
<p>This is bayes theorem in statistics. What the author needs to point out is not: what are the chances that you are vaccinated if you are infected (which translates to 30% of cases in the data), but what are the chances that you are infected if you are vaccinated.</p>
<p>Think about the numbers. If there are 10x times as many vaccinated people, and they constitue 30% of cases, and 58% of cases are unvaccinated (part of people in the authors data are status unknown, the missing 12%) that means that chance of being infected while being vaccinated are not just 1.9 times lower as seen from the data set, but 1.9x10 times lower, and that'a quite significant.</p>
<p>A historical example is introduction of helmets in infantry sections in WWI. Head trauma for personel was evenly spaced between light injuries, heavy injuries, and immediate death. Once helmets were introduced, immediate death overtook injuries. At first glance it would seem helmets are killing people, but the overall number of head trauma cases dropped sharply. Same is observed with the vaccines here.</p>

        <p>You would be right except we are comparing data, not looking at one set of statistics. We aren't only looking at vaccinated deaths and going aha! The simple facts are (rounded):</p>
<p>72k unvaccinated people had delta covid all cases. 92 died.</p>
<p>11k fully vaxxed had delta covid all cases. 118 died.</p>
<p>The unvaccinated cases outnumbered the fully vaxxed by a very large margin, yet less of them died.</p>
<p>Even when you break down the numbers by age groups, the fully vaxxed die at a larger percentage than the unvaxxed. It's true we don't know the full amount of people vaxxed, but nor do we know the full amount of people unvaxxed, but it doesn't matter because what is important are the deaths to covid compared to the non-deaths (those who got delta but didn't die) and we have those numbers, and those numbers are very damning for the fully vaxxed. </p>
<p>I understand your helmet analogy but it doesn't quite work here. For the analogy to be accurate it would need to be a comparison at the same time of soldiers who wore helmets vs those who wore none. Instead we have data when there were no helmets, and then data when helmets were introduced but no concurrent data of soldiers not wearing helmets. It would be like having data of unvaccinated cases/deaths, then vaccinating the whole population leaving no one without a vax [helmet], then trying to use this data and compare it to the old; it doesn't work to the present situation where we can see the difference between the two at the same time.</p>

<p>The vaccinated percentage of populace matter a lot here. The article talks only about infected people, never asking what are the chanes of being infected in the first place. </p>
<p>I personally dont have the EXACT numbers for vaccinated vs unvaccinated number of pepole in brittain, but about 70% of all have been vaccinated. People below 17 are not vaccinated yet, and they constitue about 20% of the populace. So some 10% are not vaccinated but can be. There are 7x more vaccinated than not. That translates to chances of infection being 14x lower when you place it in the data set from the article.</p>
<p>Article says "you have more chanced of dying if you are vaccinated", when it should be saying "you have more chanes of dying if you are vaccinated IF you get infected at all"</p>
<p>Sadly, I don't have the numbers for the whole helmet thing. It's from a lesson in statisics class. The groups (light  heavy, immediate death) reflect on people who were brought to medical stations on stretchers, nothing to say about how many injuries were succesfully treated afterwards. I'll drop it because I can't dive into the numbers right now.</p>
<p>Edit: typo</p>
