    <strong>Help me understand.</strong>
    <p><p>I am kinda new to the "covid is overblown" arena after discovering the flaw in PCR testing and its overuse. Help me understand why the hospitals are being overrun.  Here in Arkansas, our rates are climbing everyday.  I understand it could be because someone is in the hospital and happens to have tested positive  could be the reason for some. Are the rates of hospitalization comparable to other years during this time of year. What constitutes a covid hospitalization? Also what about covid deaths? What qualifies as a covid death in the numbers? Thanks. I can't find any resources online for these questions.</p></p>

        <p>Hospitals are businesses and must keep ICUs as close to 100% full as they can to increase profits. In the winter, they are often close to full or even overrun. This is in "normal" years.</p>
<p>A covid hospitalization is anyone who is hospitalized that tests positive. A covid death is anyone where covid is listed as a cause on the death cert.</p>
<p>However, this is more simplistic. In reality, there are hundreds or thousands of cases of deaths where someone died of a drug overdose, alcohol poisoning, or accident, and was listed as a covid death because they tested positive when they were admitted to the hospital. This happened a few times just in my CA county. In fact in Colorado earlier this year they revised the deaths to get rid of accidents etc after people complained, and covid deaths suddenly dropped by 25%. Moving forward i don't know if they changed how they count deaths in Colorado.</p>
<p>As for hospitalizations, they test almost everyone who goes into the hospital. So someone asymptomatic, going in for a car accident, will be a Covid hospitalization. I am very close with a nurse here in CA who has confirmed this, he works across hospitals.</p>
<p>Do I personally think this part about counting is a conspiracy? No.</p>
<p>I think it was a rushed effort to support hospitals losing business over elective surgeries. The federal government paid hospitals $13K extra for a "Covid case" and $30K extra for someone on a ventilator. So you can imagine the incentive for hospitals that were losing money, furloughed or firing nursing staff, and such.</p>
<p>I'm pretty doubtful that any of this is a conspiracy but people here will disagree with me, I know. So thats why I added the word personally above.</p>
<p>I just wanted to answer your questions as you asked them. I have been following VERY closely every step of the way, as I was skeptical back in March.</p>
<p>If you want more stringently filtered news and apolitical facts you can go to the LockdownSkepticism sub.</p>
<p>This sub is less regulated obviously but I think its good to follow both.</p>

        <p>Oh and by the way, the reason it is so hard to find stuff online isn't because we're making it up. Back in March it was a lot easier to find this stuff but I noticed as time went on, Google became essentially useless for finding reputable sources against the mainstream. But I've been scouring the Internet as I said since March and checking that sub since March. You can do your own research but major search engines make it fairly difficult to ferret out competing sources.</p>

        <p>I guess it all stems from the over testing and the oversentivity of the PCR test. It overinflates everything from the bet go and leads to higher everything else.</p>

<p>It's not just profits. Non-profit hospitals operate the same way because that's the efficient way to do it. If you have to maintain extra capacity that you'll use only once in a blue moon you'll have to pay the opportunity cost for that decision.</p>

        <p>Hey, I’m not really the one to lay it all out, but I will tell you that I’ve had a weirdly hard time finding the kind of data you’d look for to answer these questions.  I’d recommend reading the feed here and other similar subs to find what info you can.  On the front page of this sub right now is data about total annual deaths in Sweden and America failing to rise this year vs previous years.</p>
<p>The problem is normal people don’t really know what’s going on on a macro scale, so the best we can do is fact check popular beliefs and identify where we’ve been lied to.  Beyond that is just trying to deduce big picture stuff.</p>
<p>(Also hospitals generally overflow during flu season, and ICUs normally try to run at as close to 100% capacity as possible)</p>

<p>&rt;California hospitals face a ‘war zone’ of flu patients — and are setting up tents to treat them</p>
<p>&rt;Hospitals across the state are sending away ambulances, flying in nurses from out of state and not letting children visit their loved ones for fear they’ll spread the flu. Others are canceling surgeries and erecting tents in their parking lots so they can triage the hordes of flu patients.</p>
<p>&rt;“Those are all creative things we wouldn’t typically do, but in a crisis like this, we’re looking at,” said Michelle Gunnett, a nurse who oversees emergency services for a Southern California hospital system.</p>
<p>&rt;Staff members at Torrance Memorial Medical Center have been working long hours to care for a swell in sick patients that began in late December, said Dr. James McKinnell, infectious disease specialist. Some patients are incredibly ill with multiple strains of the flu, or the flu and pneumonia.</p>
<p>Full hospitals <em>is the normal mode of operation</em>. You don't build hospitals for them to sit empty.</p>
