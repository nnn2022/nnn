    <strong>Finally happened to me... employer forcing jab.</strong>
    <p><p>I never post to Reddit. I’m just so upset. I work for an older gentleman who got the vax in January. He has been making comments here and there about me getting it. I always said something vague when he brought it up. Finally yesterday, he told me that everyone over 16 in our state is eligible for the vax and I have to get it because it’s “very important”.</p>
<p>I just said “I’ll look into it.” as I could tell he was in a bad mood and I’ve been scared to tell him I will never get it. I need my job! I don’t want to be fired for this but I will never get the jab.</p>
<p>More info: I am 30 years old, healthy, and I had Covid last year before I began my employment for my now boss. I have a medical history that makes me a bad candidate for the jab anyway but more importantly, my fiancé and I want to try for a baby in the next few months. I can’t tell my boss any of this as it isn’t any of his business and I don’t want to be discriminated against for trying to get getting pregnant. I always wear my mask around my boss and we work in different offices. I have no coworkers.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any advice or has anyone been in this situation? </p>
<p>I am fully vaccinated with all REAL vaccines and I even got my tetanus booster a year and a half ago!! Should I try to find a doctor who will write me a note? </p>
<p>I am prepared for the provax trolls to bombard me. I just don’t care now. My employer has his vaccine yet is forcing me to get one even though the vax doesn’t prevent transmission!! Fml</p></p>

        <p>Just tell him thats your private medical information that you're uncomfortable disclosing, and that you're not legally obligated to divulge it, nor is he legally allowed to request it.</p>
<p>That's all.</p>
<p>If he tries to tell you that you will need to get the vaccine in order to continue working, simply ask him for what he just said in writing, and take it to an Attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, do it anyway... Call his bluff, and begin looking for a new job.</p>
<p>.... Or just get the vaccine... But if you're considering doing that, ask yourself if the job is worth it to you.</p>

        <p>I will try to be more direct with my boss and mention my medical history and tell him I may not be able to receive the vax, it’s just a little hard for me to do so.</p>
<p>Also, my boss is an attorney so I will not be quoting to him any legalities regarding the vax. Our state, like most, is an at will employment state so I must measure my response. He could fire me for almost any reason he chooses.</p>
<p>I’m wondering if there has been a tried and true legal reason for refusing an employer mandating the vax at this point. Thank you so much for replying and please, if you have any more suggestions let me know. I am desperate.</p>

        <p>This is pretty simple but a confrontation and discussion will be required with your boss. From what you have written so far I am guessing that this is not your strong point. </p>
<p>If it is made a requirement of employment, ask to see proof that you are indemnified by his company should anything go wrong or you suffer any adverse effects. It is illegal for a company to force an employee to take medication without it being underwritten by their public liability insurance. I am guessing here, but I very much doubt that his pi will cover vaccine damage for employees. Explain about you concerns regarding certain health issues you have that may cause a reaction and that you may want to start a family someday.</p>
<p>I would imagine he will either fire you or back off. If you want to protect your job make sure all of the above is done in writing so there is a paper trail. Even get him to make the request to vaccinate in writing. This way if he fires you, you will have recourse to the law for unfair dismissal.</p>

        <p>Thanks so much for your reply. I think I have to write down and send my boss an email explaining why I will not get the vaccine. I will also ask him outright if getting the vaccine is a requirement for my employment.</p>
<p>He tells me all the time how I am good at my job, and I know he would be in a bad situation if I quit, so I have at least some leverage.</p>
<p>I just thought there might be a simple answer to this absurd situation. Imagine if your boss was the average poster in /r/politics. Wish me luck.</p>

        <p>Luckily I own a small company with my dad and brother so we call the shots. I have a strong sense human rights and freedoms. We have even turned down jobs where clients have insisted we wear masks. I Couldnt care less, I am not operating dangerous mechanical equipment, which is part of the job, whilst breathing through a mask. This would have been absolutely outlawed before the pandemic due to safety risks so we are not starting it now because of a government insisting upon it.</p>
<p>My advice is to wait until he mentions it again, which will be soon and then politely ask him to put the request in writing so you can reply formally. In your reply asking for the level of pi indemnity for vaccine damage the company has taken on (which I estimate to be zero)  make sure you reference a simple sentence going over any verbal requests that occurred before his written request. Try and remember the dates and number of informal requests now and jot them down.</p>
<p>In you request for pi indemnity your letter should start thank you for your request for me to take the vax blah, then. This follows two informal conversations on  blah April you asked blah and on blah April you asked blah. On the blah I requested you make the vaccine request in writing. </p>
<p>This will ensure everything is contained within the formal context. I am willing to bet that as soon as you start being formal and ask for the indemnity he will change his attitude competely. My pi will not allow me to do that. There might be some pi cover out there that will, but the only people that can afford that level of cover would be multi national corps.  He will have two choices, back off and forget it or try and fire you. Good luck.</p>

        <p>Like panicmaster Said, dont write anything to him until you get a written request. </p>
<p>If you want to keep it "casual," are you female? Is the boss male? There's all sorts of words and phrases which the average man doesn't understand like "clotting," "menstruation," "ovarian," "fertility"</p>
<p>Example "without disclosing too much of my medical history, I am prone to clotting issues in my reproductive area, and was advised not to risk anything that would exacerbate my condition."</p>

        <p>See which exemptions your state offers, then go to the local health dept and request whichever exemption they have that pertains to you. When I did this in two different states, they didn't even ask questions. They just gave it to me and I then gave it to the daycare with no questions asked.</p>

        <p>Does he know you already had Covid?  Go the natural immunity route?  Or possibly a test for antibodies?</p>
<p>I also have a medical history that clearly is stated in the manufacturer’s vaccine paperwork (was able to read it when I took someone to get their vaccine) that I am not recommended for the vaccine.  I have a history of anaphylaxis and a sensitivity to propylene glycol even if it gets on my skin, and there is no way I will be getting it either.  Would something like that work?  If it’s written clearly in the manufacture’s insert, there isn’t any room for argument.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, I certainly wouldn’t get a shot just for a job.  You only have one body in this lifetime, and there is more than one job out there.</p>

        <p>He doesn’t know anything about my covid history or stance on the jab as he never asked me! Ever since the beginning he only asked me if I got the jab, when I WILL get it, and now says I must get it. Ha! And for the antibodies test, even if it shows I do have antibodies, MSM is recommending I should get it anyway. My boss takes everything the news says as gospel.</p>
<p>I will search for more complications that I may have from the vaccine for more reasons to give to my boss. Maybe I can find a copy of the vaccine insert online.</p>
<p>I plan to write him an email explaining my refusal to get the jab and asking him if it’s required for my employment. I hate confrontation and don’t think I’ll be able to state my reasoning to him in person.</p>
<p>Thank you for your input. I can’t believe I am risking my livelihood by refusing experimental gene therapy.</p>

        <p>If you have a medical history that doesn’t make you a candidate for the vaccine, that’s definitely the route to go.  Regardless of what the MSM says, there are certain medical conditions that are clearly stated in the insert that the manufacturer does not recommend the vaccine for, and if you are in that category, jump on that for sure.  That’s straight from the source and irrefutable.</p>
<p>Wish I had taken a picture of the insert, but it is clearly stated, so in my case, it worked perfectly.  Although I never planned on getting it anyway, even if I wanted to, I’m out.  Hopefully you will be too.</p>

        <p>He told me there is no reason now that I can’t get the vaccine, to make sure I get it and that it’s very important. There is nothing in writing and he didn’t outright say i would be fired if I don’t get it, but who knows how much he will enforce it.</p>

        <p>Then just ignore it until it's an actual written policy. I doubt he'll do that because he sounds like a giant pussy. So just keep doing your job and when he ask you about the vaccine just tell him "don't fucking worry about it buddy."</p>
