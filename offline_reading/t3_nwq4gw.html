    <strong>"Asymptomatic spread" is just mental conditioning to get the public ready for "guilty until proven innocent"</strong>
    <p><p>The idea that people can be stripped of their freedoms for mere suspicion of wrongdoing is being pushed to prepare the public for an authoritarian government. </p>
<p>This is why there is such a major focus on asymptomatic spread.</p>
<p>When someone is accused of committing a crime, they get their day in court, and they must receive due process before being stripped of their freedom.</p>
<p>They do not have to prove their innocence to remain free - the prosecutor must prove that they both committed a crime AND intended to do so.</p>
<p>What we have seen with COVID is a complete reversal of that concept. With asymptomatic spread supposedly the primary form of transmission, we are all guilty of spreading the disease until we are temporarily proven innocent by virtue of a negative test result.</p>
<p>As such, we are perpetually treated as criminals. We are forced to wear masks, get vaccinated, and lockdown, even if we are not known to be sick. This is based on the concept that we are all guilty of spreading the disease unless we can prove our innocence.</p>
<p>Unlike the suspect charged with a crime, we do not get due process. There is no prosecution that must prove our guilt (in this case, sickness) prior to depriving us of our freedoms.</p>
<p>The criminal at least gets a trial (with the burden of proof on the prosecution) before he is restricted in how he is able to live his life. We do not.</p>
<p>Think about that for a second - why in the hell is that a good thing? </p>
<p>How is deprivation of freedoms without a trial proving guilt something that should be praised? </p>
<p>We shouldn't want that, because it is a horrible idea for us. It means that arbitrary deprivation of rights will become the norm, and we will be subject to the whims of whoever has power.</p>
<p>This is EXACTLY why asymptomatic spread has been focused on so much. It is the prelude to "guilty until proven innocent."</p>
<p>Such a philosophy is necessary to run an authoritarian state. If the state does not have the power to arbitrarily punish dissenters, it cannot be authoritarian. </p>
<p>The powers that be are conditioning us right now. They are acclimating us to this "New Normal" where they have total control over their subjects. </p>
<p>They want us to believe that it is not only normal, but morally righteous to deprive individuals of liberty under mere suspicion of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it would seem that a large chunk (if not the majority) of the population has bought into this belief. It would appear that those in power have done their jobs well.</p>
<p>We will see how this plays out in the near future. </p>
<p>Mark my words, in the coming years, we will see a continued focus on "asymptomatic spread" and other similar concepts that condition the public to accept "guilty until proven innocent." </p>
<p>They are doing this with guns currently as well. </p>
<p>Gun owners are treated as criminals despite the fact that an infinitesimally small number use their weapons to commit crime, and a substantial amount of the criminal use is among "career criminals" that are already well-known to law enforcement and usually cannot legally possess a weapon but do so anyways. </p>
<p>Despite this fact, every law-abiding gun owner is treated as the next Adam Lanza or Dylan Klebold. Their right to bear arms must be limited because of the idea that they MIGHT use it in a crime.</p>
<p>This is despite the fact that the overwhelming majority will never use it in an illegal manner at any point in their life. Even if that were the case, in a truly free and just society, individual gun owners would need to be proven guilty of using their weapon to harm others prior to being deprived of their right to bear one.</p>
<p>"Red flag" gun laws provide the government with a way to arbitrarily remove the right to bear arms from an individual over mere suspicion that they might harm themselves or others. </p>
<p>They are treated as "guilty until proven innocent," and they are stripped of their rights prior to receiving due process. </p>
<p>This process started a while ago, but it is now accelerating. We are being conditioned to support arbitrary punishment and deprivation of rights.</p>
<p>Start paying attention to this trend. It will be the defining legal principle of the "New Normal."</p>
<p>Edit: I wrote this when I was tired and a bit out of it, and I forgot to include a few things that were actually quite important to the discussion. I also failed to tie this current erosion of rights to the long-term trend, as well as explain why this time is different. </p>
<p>Some people have called it out, and I thank them for reminding me. I made quite a major error there.</p>
<p>It is true that the presumption of innocence has never been absolute in the US. From the inception of the nation, certain groups have been stripped of their right to due process. </p>
<p>For example, black Americans did not have equal rights under the law up until rather recently, and there is ample room for debate as to whether they are currently treated as equals to white Americans by the justice system.</p>
<p>In more recent times, as some noted, things such as civil forfeiture, Japanese internment camps, the wars on drugs/terror, and the Patriot Act have been used to deprive Americans of due process.</p>
<p>My main point with writing this post, as I told someone in the comments, is to highlight the fact that we have not yet seen such overt deprivation of due process for the population as a whole.</p>
<p>This is a both a test and an exercise. The government is testing just how much they can get away with before encountering too much resistance, and also conditioning us all to accept the normalization of both current and future limitations on autonomy and freedom.</p>
<p>Previously, the infringements upon that right have been limited to smaller minority groups (racial/ethnic minorities, drug users, the poor, etc.) that historically were viewed with suspicion by the majority group.</p>
<p>(As a disclaimer, it was wrong when they infringed upon the rights of those groups too. I do not support the oppression of anyone.)</p>
<p>The government also has not (in previous instances) been as overt with regards to what they are doing. They tend to try to hide it, or at the very least have it not be something that noticeably affects our day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>Using the Patriot Act as an example, it permits spying on pretty much everything done on an electronic device, but you do not notice it. </p>
<p>It happens without you even knowing, and the government has gone to great lengths to limit public knowledge of the extent of their unethical actions. </p>
<p>They believed (rightfully) that the public would be infuriated if they fully understood the extent of what that law permits.</p>
<p>The enforcement of guilty-until-proven-innocent (or in this case, sick until tested negative) during this pandemic is ever-present, and in-your-face. The mask is a constant and highly-visible reminder that you are guilty of wrongdoing, even if you did nothing wrong. </p>
<p>The fact that the government is bold enough to so openly toss out due process for the ENTIRE population is what I wrote this post about. </p>
<p>This is unique - we haven't seen such blatant disregard for "innocent-until-proven-guilty" at any point in our nation's history.</p>
<p>If they feel confident enough that the general public will accept such a flagrant violation of rights, they have much worse lined up for us in the near future. </p>
<p>They are conditioning us to accept current pandemic-related deprivation of due process as well as future arbitrary removal of freedom and autonomy by an authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>As it turns out, unfortunately, they were probably right. Most people in this country have no issue with losing due process (or other rights) under the guise of "public safety."</p>
<p>We can expect that in the near future there will no longer be a presumption of innocence for any crime. So long as they can keep manufacturing reasons to be afraid, they will keep on becoming more and more authoritarian. </p>
<p>Given that they evidently no longer feel the need to beat around the bush, and have found it acceptable to openly remove due process from the entire population, we do not have long left before we all live as subjects instead of citizens.</p>
<p>The slow march towards authoritarianism is reaching it's natural conclusion. There are not many options for the government to look into after this pandemic in terms of depriving rights that formed the foundation of our society's legal system, as they have already trampled on nearly every one of them.</p>
<p>If we do not resist this "New Normal" now, we won't have long left before all freedom and autonomy is forever lost.</p></p>

<p>They now have the technology to finally be as evil as they have always wanted to be.</p>
<p>The next 5-10 years will be the last chance for us to keep such a future from coming to fruition. If we fail, freedom will be lost forever.</p>

<p>Remember the 5G causes Covid conspiracy?</p>
<p>Well, it is partly true. Because 5G is what enables industrie 4.0 which in turn is needed for all the juicy control mechanism and AI operating system such as mass surveilance and CBDC that are coming soon.</p>

<p>A). None of those things have anything to do with Covid</p>

        <p>A) In the Context of OP - Precrime has links to it. 5G-Covid conspiracy wouldnt exist without Covid, ldo.</p>
<p>B) Im not talking about mass-surveillance alone, Im talking about the next things to come. Stuff like Rheinmetalls Automatic Drone "Defense" Systems that act indepently of an operator (which they even call "Skynex"...) or those sexy Robotdogs that will help your local Police Departments in the near future.</p>

        <p>So, to reiterate, we're facing the possibility of an oppressive technocracy that will strangle free and independent thinking, possibly for mankind's indefinite existence, and the counter proposal is that Jesus will come back and save us... but only if we surrender ourselves and worship him. Otherwise we face the wrath of a omnipotent god. How the sweet holy fuck do you expect anyone to consider this a good thing? Trading one totalitarian system for and even greater one is not my idea of salvation.</p>

<p>I completely understand the thought process behind your statement, I was there once. </p>
<p>To be clear, Jesus <em>WILL</em> come back and save us, it is written. What does it matter what I expect? I'm charged to spread the Word to as many as will listen. </p>
<p>As has been said here, please,  PLEASE, read your Bible. </p>
<p>It is not beyond your comprehension. </p>
<p>Man is wicked, period. We are not worthy of salvation, and yet, He, the only begotten Son, came to us and paid for our sins in His blood. </p>
<p>All it takes is a quick glance around to grasp that this world is indeed wicked. Our Creator saw fit to send to us His only Son, to save us, to redeem us in His eyes. </p>
<p>Rejoice, for He is risen.</p>
<p>John 3.16-19 KJV</p>
<p>16For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</p>

        <p>I'm in the Philippines. Guilty until proven innocent is already the case here and the country probably has the harshest mask mandates in the world (you have to wear a face mask AND a face shield even if you are outside and alone). </p>
<p>I have been unable to work or leave the country for two and a half years because I was assaulted by six people and they filed false assault charges against me in an attempt to escape prosecution. </p>
<p>I spent over a week in a tiny jail cell with 70+ other people, when the cell was not even big enough to hold 15. If I hadn't paid bail, I would still be in that cell now waiting for my case to be over.</p>
<p>My case has been going on for two and a half years despite the fact that their only evidence is one of my assailants blatantly committing perjury by giving two different statements (both of which were false) in one hearing.</p>
<p>So I disagree with your opinion.</p>

        <p>I am sorry to hear that, and I wish you luck with your case. </p>
<p>I suppose that my post would probably not resonate with you if you are from a country where the right to due process is not enshrined in your legal process.</p>
<p>You may have a different standard of law or law enforcement in the Philippines. I am not familiar with your culture, unfortunately, so I cannot speak as to what you would experience.</p>
<p>I wrote this from a standpoint of a US citizen, whose constitution specifically outlines the need for due process before deprivation of rights.</p>
<p>In Western democracies, especially the US, we have historically had a strong emphasis on "innocent until proven guilty." It is the cornerstone of our criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Has it always been uniformly enforced? No. But never at a level like this. Deprivation of due process has traditionally been a way that our powerful used to harm minority groups, but never the population as a whole. </p>
<p>(As a side note, it was wrong when they deprived minority groups of their rights as well. I feel like I need to include that as a disclaimer before someone takes exception with my wording.)</p>
<p>This leads me to believe that they are setting the stage for something big. They would not make the jump from minority to majority deprivation of rights without having something major in the works. </p>
<p>It would be too unpopular, and would lead to the public viewing the government as an enemy and fighting back. Evidently, they view complete subjugation of the public as a whole to be a viable strategy in the near future. </p>
<p>If the US goes openly authoritarian, the rest of the world is screwed. Our government has been emboldened to exert increasingly aggressive control over it's constituents, and this is great cause for concern.</p>

        <p>I'm actually British rather than Filipino. In the UK it is also innocent until proven guilty, but in the Philippines it is the opposite. </p>
<p>I personally don't think that there is any attempt to make a switch to guilty until proven innocent in the Western world.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the main purpose of 'Asymptomatic spread' is to justify the requirement for everybody to need to wear a mask. </p>
<p>The masks serve two purposes.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To remind everybody that there is supposed to be a deadly virus. This maintains the fear and those who are afraid of the virus are more likely to be injected. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To annoy those who don't fear the virus. This also results in more people getting injected as there are people who are getting injected so that they no longer need to wear masks.</p>

        <p>I shouldn't have a criminal record as they have no evidence other than a guy giving two different statements in one hearing. </p>
<p>The only way I can lose the case is if the judge is willing to risk his career by sending a blatantly innocent man to prison. </p>
<p>While the case is ongoing though I am unable to leave the country or work here as both require NBI clearance. </p>
<p>I'm hoping to sue the people who filed false charges against me for more money than they will ever earn in their entire lives (since they have prevented me from working in the UK for almost three years), but I doubt that a judge will deem it fair that they need to pay me the amount of money they have cost me. </p>
<p>I will have spent over 150,000 on extending my visa alone (purely because of this case) by the time this is over and I am not expecting to get that back since a judge could easily rule that I got something out of those fees (the right to stay in the Philippines...).</p>
<p>I am only expecting to get my legal fees back as compensation, despite the fact that that will only be about 100,000 out of the 3,500,000+ this bogus case has cost me.</p>

        <p>The embassy can't intervene with another country's legal system. </p>
<p>It's also not feasible for me to return to the UK at present. </p>
<p>It's mandatory to take a PCR test before travelling. These are useless and if the person running my test wants it to be positive it will be, so I don't consent to the test. </p>
<p>You also have to pay around 120,000PHP to be detained in a prison camp for ten days upon returning to the UK. You then need to take another two of the useless tests while being detained in the prison camp. If one is positive you have to stay in the prison camp for longer.</p>

        <p>"With asymptomatic spread supposedly the primary form of transmission, we are all guilty of spreading the disease until we are temporarily proven innocent by virtue of a negative test result."</p>
<p>Even this is a stretch... every time I go to the dentist they require me to take a test (and I have been going regularly for Invisalign) and every single time it comes back negative.  Does that negative result change anything for me?  Nope, still have to wait outside away from the lobby until my appointment, still have to wear a mask unless they're literally looking in my mouth, still have to put on a mask should I walk 5 feet outside the dentist office to go to the grocery store/bagel shop/anything... SO INSANE.</p>

        <p>You just were not paying attention before. "Guilty until proven innocent"? Yeah... NO.</p>
<p>Once accused, you wait in jail unless you have $$$$$ to buy your way out. You could spend years 'awaiting trial'. You will be pressured to 'just take the plea deal' by your government paid 'Lawyer' that is golfing buddies with the Prosecutor. (Let's not forget the fun 'sexy times' you can expect while waiting) </p>
<p>Even on guns, as bad as 'red flag' laws are, nothing new. Remember Hurricane Katrina? There was no 'rights' when the police, backed by NG troops came for your guns to 'encourage' you to leave. Let's not ignore 'asset forfieture' either. Where if police want your property, they just take it. Oh, YOU are not guilty of any crime, you get no day in court. Your PROPERTY is accused of the crime &amp; confiscated. </p>
<p>Aaaand, of course, if Cops want, they can just kill you &amp; 'investigate themselves to find they did nothing wrong'. </p>
<p>Yay, land of the free.</p>

        <p>Thank you for reminding me of what I left out.</p>
<p>I forgot to include those issues in my post. I am very familiar with what you talked about, as well as a number of other past examples. </p>
<p>I was tired this morning, and forgot to explain why this time is different when I wrote this post. </p>
<p>There definitely has been a long and storied history of deprivation of due process (and other rights) in the US, but never before has it been like what we are seeing now.</p>
<p>Those past deprivations of due process that you described have mostly been limited to subsections of the population that the majority tends to view with suspicion, and this is especially true when they openly act in flagrant violation of individual rights. </p>
<p>If they include the entire population, like with the Patriot Act, they make damn sure that nobody is really aware of what is truly going on.</p>
<p>The fact that they are now expanding such deprivations of rights to the entire population and making their actions highly visible is cause for great concern.</p>
<p>They believe now that they can openly trample on rights and the general public will accept it, if not beg for more. </p>
<p>It is different this time. They are escalating their power grab, and feel confident enough in their capability to enforce it that they are openly eliminating the presumption of innocence for the population as a whole. </p>
<p>This has never happened before in US history. We should all pay close attention to what is to come in the near future.</p>

        <p>Oh, I disagree. It has been far, far, worse. Look up what was done to Japanese-Americans for WW2. </p>
<p>Most forgot &amp; didn't care about that, &amp; all the things you &amp; I have mentioned, &amp; most cheered the "Patriot Act", truly bi-partisan in that after crying about what Bush did, Obama did more!</p>
<p>Now, most are either ignoring or cheering the new "emergency powers". Far too many are openly calling for 'us' to be rounded up like Japanese-Americans were, or worse. There is nothing new about any of this, you are just realizing YOU (&amp; I) may be next in line for all the fine "American justice" so many others got. </p>
<p>Maybe a few dozen fine, upstanding, masked &amp; vaxxed folks will drag us out &amp; hang us. Won't be anything new about that either. (Ummm, just substitute "Klansmen" for 'vaxxed')</p>

        <p>So how about instead of complaining on Reddit, you start tearing down the establishment? I’m tired of hearing people sit around all day and talk about freedoms being removed and then not doing anything. Protesting won’t stop a corrupt government, voting won’t stop a corrupt government. If you believe this crap, get off your ass and physically risk your life to stop it by any means</p>

        <p>I wish that were the case. </p>
<p>But just like with the Patriot Act and the backlash to the leaks showing the depth of what the NSA does, people didn't particularly care enough to do anything about it. </p>
<p>The Patriot Act is still law, Edward Snowden is still living in exile, and the NSA is still exercising spy power that makes the Stasi look like junior detectives. </p>
<p>Even with widespread vaccination, many parts of the US are reticent to permit a full return to the old normal. They are implementing vaccine passports and keeping mask requirements/business limitations despite falling case numbers and death counts.</p>
<p>Not only are people very clearly aware of this deprivation of autonomy and rights, they seem to support it and desire more.</p>
<p>God forbid a new variant (especially a more deadly one) comes around, and we go for round two. Then, we can see exactly what they have in store for us. I'm not looking forward to it.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. I am extremely skeptical of the idea that the vaccines are being used to kill off a bunch of people like some would claim. Why would they kill off their most loyal supporters? That makes no sense.</p>
<p>If anything, the logical conspiracy theory involving mass vaccine casualties would be that the shot would protect the faithful, and they would then unleash an extremely deadly disease that would wipe out the dissenters.</p>
<p>I believe that the biggest threat posed by them is conditioning the public into being comfortable with giving up bodily autonomy to the government. </p>
<p>If they can force you to put substances into your body, they own you. They have dehumanized you, and you are now livestock.</p>
<p>There's always the risk that they could be dangerous, and if VAERS data is credible, they definitely appear to be more harmful than other vaccines. How much so? I don't know; I'm not an -ologist or -ian that studies those. </p>
<p>Do I feel they are safe based off of the checkered pasts of the companies that produce them and the institutions that regulate them, as well as the complete disregard for adverse reactions that has been shown so far during the rollout? No.</p>
<p>But that risk seems to pale in comparison to the threat that is posed by having a population that does not hold dominion over their own bodies.</p>
<p>And you are right - a massive chunk of our compatriots not only support giving up their rights and bodily autonomy, but demand that you must do so as well. It is not good enough for them to take the Mark; everyone else must participate too.</p>

        <p>Just like polio. Something like 95 to 99 percent of people infected with the polio virus are asymptomatic.  </p>
<p>But they can still pass it on and get others extremely sick or worse.</p>
<p>Pretend asymptomatic spread is some new thing.  Shoehorn it into your weird parallels about society and justice and whatever else you're talking about.  </p>
<p>But facts are facts.  Medical science is medical science.  Asymptomatic spread of a virus is a very real and potentially dangerous thing.</p>

        <p>It is a real thing. </p>
<p>I would remind you, however, that one does not need to be a virologist or epidemiologist to have an educated opinion regarding political institutions or law.</p>
<p>There is more than one type of "science" involved in the policy shaping the response to this pandemic, unless of course you happen to disagree with the overwhelming majority of academia and don't consider "soft sciences" to be legitimate fields of study. </p>
<p>Science is science, you are correct. But just as a virologist can examine trends of viruses, someone who has been formally educated in a field that focuses on the studies of government, law, and political institutions can analyze trends based on what they see as well.</p>
<p>I happen to have those credentials. I am not a lawyer, but I have extensive formal education in a field that focuses on similar topics. I am as qualified to talk about these things as anyone could be.</p>
<p>With that out of the way - it is very convenient that this pandemic has brought out every manner of infringement on liberty and autonomy despite having a less than one percent death rate even when you include the extremely old and unhealthy. </p>
<p>There has never been a response like this to any disease in US history. </p>
<p>Even with the asymptomatically-spread polio you talk about, we did not shut down to this extent, and any measures taken to stop the spread were either voluntary or voted on before being implemented. </p>
<p>https://www.aier.org/article/no-lockdowns-the-terrifying-polio-pandemic-of-1949-52/</p>
<p>Vaccine mandates/passports, contact tracing, shutdowns of small business, mask requirements, etc. are rather extreme burdens on freedom and bodily autonomy. </p>
<p>They give the government nearly complete control over your life. They determine what you must wear, what you must put into your body, who you can be around, where you can go, and what you are permitted to do for both recreation and sustenance. </p>
<p>Why do the powerful not have to obey these requirements? Why are they free to "apologize" when they break the rules, whereas your average person would face punishment?</p>
<p>If this disease is so deadly, why do our government officials evidently not feel at risk of contracting or spreading the disease? </p>
<p>Given the risk to the gerontocracy that is our government, you would surely expect for them to treat this disease as a matter of national security and strictly enforce any and all measures regarding COVID.</p>
<p>At the very least, you would expect them to abide by the laws and mandates that they wrote. </p>
<p>Why do they make these arbitrary and invasive limitations and not follow them like we must?</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-politicians-who-violated-covid-19-rules-guidance-list-2020-12?op=1#house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-8</p>
<p>Because it has never been about the disease. The government does not give a damn whether or not the elderly and weak die. </p>
<p>From a cynic's point of view, the governments of many Western nations would likely prefer that the elderly die en masse to prevent the guaranteed insolvency of social welfare programs in the near future. </p>
<p>Given that many Western nations have aging (and horribly sickly) populations that are close to or below replacement rate, something must change. </p>
<p>Either the elderly must go, there must be a substantial increase in births, or the wealthy will have to sacrifice their money. The last two are not likely to happen.</p>
<p>So sure, asymptomatic spread is a thing, but so is consolidating wealth and power in the hands of individuals and organizations that already had too much to begin with.</p>
<p>It is not unreasonable to ask that people follow pandemic guidelines which could prevent asymptomatic spread. I have no problem with that.</p>
<p>However, it is flat-out false to claim that these arbitrary and illegitimate infringements on freedom and autonomy were crafted and implemented with no ulterior motives. There is something major going on here, and it is not about disease.</p>
<p>It is not conspiracy theory; it is observable by anyone who pays attention.</p>

        <p>I'm curious if most people think COVID specifically does not spread when people are asymptomatic, or if they think asymptomatic spread for COVID and for other illnesses is not possible. I know that polio and some sexually transmitted infections can be transmitted by someone who is asymptomatic, so the idea of COVID being spread by asymptomatic individuals didn't seem unreasonable.</p>
