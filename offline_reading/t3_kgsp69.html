    <strong>'Behave as if you're infected' - UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/behave-as-if-you-have-the-virus-239419/">Health Secretary Matt Hancock warns Kent residents to be 'really cautious' as the county has a 'serious problem' with coronavirus (kentonline.co.uk)</a></p>
<p>I gave them the benefit of the doubt over this 12,607th 'mutant strain,' but why Hancock chose <em>now</em> to act on it - when it has been known about since September - actively contradicts his appeal to health concerns. Therefore he must have <em>other</em> concerns, like how far his star will rise if a thousand more 'undesirables' commit suicide. The British government has actively colluded to kill the disabled since 2010:  <a href="https://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/hundreds-dying-every-year-after-pip-rejections-and-number-may-even-be-rising/">Hundreds dying every year after PIP rejections, and number may even be rising – Disability News Service</a>. This is why I winced when they suddenly claimed to care about health. But now their hatred and malice for you and your families is all too clear.</p></p>

        <p>That's mentally unhealthy and in a saner time would indicate possible OCD. Better to behave as if you're infected <em>if you have evidence you are</em> - like you're sick and your symptoms are consistent with COVID, or someone you live with is. Otherwise the chance that you have it is low and the chances you could transmit it to someone else even lower, since asymptomatic spread is uncommon. IIRC there was a recent study that showed symptomatic people spread it to others in their household 68% of the time, but if they had a positive test and were asymptomatic, it was 0.7%. That's living together and breathing the same air in a small building most of the day for several days, so transmission in indoor public places if asymptomatic would be much lower, and outdoors, negligible.</p>
<p>So the main thing they can do to prevent spread would be to strongly encourage people with symptoms to stay home and healthy people to stay away from infected households, except for serious emergencies. And if the government really has to be involved because of course they want to put their paws all over it, they could simply guarantee two weeks of paid sick leave to people who don't get that at their job. It would cost much less and be much less intrusive than shutting down businesses and sending the cops after people who visit their friends or don't wear a mask at the park.</p>

        <p>What does that mean. If I'm not contaminated, how can I pretend I'm contaminated?</p>
<p>Does this guy want me to live locked in the bathroom, my wife locked in the bedroom and my kids locked in their bedroom just in case one of us is contaminated? What a piece of shit.</p>
