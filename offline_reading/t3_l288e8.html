    <strong>Is the NHS overwhelmed?</strong>
    <p><p>A  woman was arrested in her home after she posted <a href="https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/woman-arrested-connection-video-filmed-4841311">a video</a> of herself wandering around an apparently empty Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.</p>
<p>The video appears to conflict with the impression left on the  mainstream media: that hospitals are full with COVID-19 patients and  can't cope. It appears to conflict with the reports of doctors and  nurses who are insisting that they are indeed busy and are working overwhelmingly long shifts to keep up with the added stress caused by COVID-19. So what's going on?</p>
<p>The answer appears to be complicated. Here's a summary of the situation according to the data:</p>
<p><strong>Hospitals are overwhelmed but not due to an influx of COVID-19 patients. They are overwhelmed because the NHS has reduced bed capacity and are sending people home who test positive for COVID-19. The number of people with coronavirus in hospitals is large but the number of people coming into hospitals is about the same (a bit worse) as a very bad flu season.</strong></p>
<p>According to the NHS official spreadsheet <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/Beds-Timeseries-2010-11-onwards-DAY-ONLY-Q2-2020-21-DE5WC.xls">Beds Time-series 2010-11 onwards (XLS, 93KB)</a> (download <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/bed-availability-and-occupancy/bed-data-day-only/">here</a>), the overnight bed occupancy rate is actually lower than in previous years^(1). The reason why is more or less explained in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/55536762">this article</a>.</p>
<p>The reason why staff are so busy, despite there actually being fewer patients in hospital than normal is because of the measures being taken to  prevent infection spreading. This involves sending doctors and nurses home when they test positive for coronavirus, making them go through anti-infection procedures and reducing the total number of available beds so that they can be spaced out (the total number of overnight beds was reduced by about 10,000 in this period).</p>
<p>In addition, the NHS is already an overwhelmed health system. Dr Mark Holland, president of the Society for Acute Medicine (SAM), said "the volume of patients and disease severity is so much that we are now functioning at the edge of what is possible" <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/10/nhs-hospitals-overwhelmed-patients-could-die-top-doctor">in 2016</a>. In 2018, the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/07/patients-turned-away-intensive-care-lack-beds-shortage-hospitals">reported that</a> "four in five intensive care units (ICUs) are having to send patients to other hospitals as a result of chronic bed and staff shortages." It is plausible, therefore, that reducing the capacity of beds and sending staff home would make the NHS even more overwhelmed than it was before.</p>
<p>This makes perfect sense in response to a highly infectious disease: Take steps to reduce infection. However, these measures make less sense when, according to the official data, it appears that this pandemic is comparable to a very bad flu season.</p>
<p>According to this NHS official spreadsheet <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/Covid-Publication-14-01-2021.xlsx">January 2021 COVID Publication (XLSX, 12.8MB)</a> (download <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-hospital-activity/">here</a>), <strong>the number of people</strong> <strong>admitted to hospital with COVID-19 daily in England</strong> was about 300 at the start of November. It reached about 1,000 in early January^(2).</p>
<p>This number of people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 is comparable to the number of people admitted to hospital with the flu. I couldn't find official data on historic flu admissions. However, if we use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201216145114/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42652675">this BBC article</a> as a reference, "around 5,000 people were admitted to hospital with flu in the first week of January" in 2018. The number of people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in England during this winter has reached about 1,000 people a day, so about 7,000 people a week. 2018 was a bad flu year, so we can say this year is comparable (a bit worse) to a bad flu year.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the NHS <em>is</em> overwhelmed but <em>not</em> because the public are catching SARS-CoV-2 at an extraordinary rate. The NHS is overwhelmed because (1) it is already an overwhelmed system and (2) the hospitals are working at a reduced capacity.</p>
<p>^(1) The occupancy rate of overnight beds is usually around 85%. However, it was at 50% at 2020/21 Q1 and 70% at 2020/21 Q2. In other words: The have been proportionally fewer people in hospital at the end of 2020 and start of 2021 than in previous years.</p>
<p>^(2) If you use this spreadsheet <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/COVID-19-daily-admissions-and-beds-20210121.xlsx">Daily Admissions and Beds 21 January 2021 (XLSX, 164KB)</a> on the same page you may be led to believe that the number of people being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 daily in England has been around 4,000. However, this is the number of admissions and "diagnoses in hospital."</p></p>

        <p>Ya but there are certainly ways to do it anonymously. I just don’t see anyone on here doing it. Either the UK is a full surveillance state and everyone is too scared to talk, or they actually are busy.  I wouldn’t know since I don’t work there. </p>
<p>I can only speak for the hospital I work at. And we’ve never been less busy than we were in 2020. That’s a fact and you can take it to the bank. Covid is a real disease but it’s never been bad enough to overwhelm an entire hospital system- at least not in the US. Not even close. </p>
<p>That’s the main reason I’m anti lockdown. Cause I know they aren’t needed. We would have done just fine with essentially no interventions whatsoever, besides some basic recommendations like hand hygiene and such.</p>

        <p>&rt;Either the UK is a full surveillance state and everyone is too scared to talk</p>
<p>No, lots of people here have no fight in them. They accept things as they go and don't complain. It's a cultural thing.</p>
<p>you can interpret it as "too scared to talk", but it's more like having a lobotomy. They don't think they need to talk.</p>
