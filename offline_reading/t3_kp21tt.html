        <p>People are becoming crazier and crazier with the brainwashing.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I was in the comments section of a news video about people partying despite being in a pandemic.</p>
<p>There was a comment where the guy said he wishes he could run over them with a car. And another saying the police should throw them in jail.</p>

        <p>&rt;A 32-year-old Arizona mother is accused of assaulting her children and stepchildren for not wearing masks after they tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>&rt;Court charging documents obtained Thursday show that Maricopa County resident Sarah Michelle Boone is facing three counts of child abuse, three counts of assault as well as disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.</p>
<p>&rt;Police were called to Boone's Wickenburg home Saturday night. Officers were told that Boone had hit one child in the face, kicked a second one while he was on the floor and picked a third child up by the neck. She allegedly did this in reaction to the children not wearing masks despite having the virus.</p>
<p>&rt;Boone left before police came but officers found her walking down the street, according to the documents. Officers say she ignored their command to stop and then fought them when they tried to arrest her. Officers ended up shocking her with a stun gun. She was then handcuffed.</p>
<p>&rt;In the documents, authorities said they encountered Boone before on three previous incidents of domestic violence. They also indicated that Boone is an alcoholic and was under the influence when she struck the children.</p>
<p>&rt;Boone was taken to a Maricopa County Jail. <strong>She was released on Tuesday on a $5,000 bond</strong>, said Calbert Gillett, a spokesman for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.</p>
<p>&rt;There was no immediate response Thursday to messages left at several numbers listed for Boone seeking comment.</p>
<p>&rt;According to the documents, she has not yet been assigned a court-appointed attorney. Her next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Already out of jail despite violently resisting arrest and multiple domestic violence prior encounters. </p>
<p>This person is obviously a violent, drunken lunatic who should not be anywhere near children in any year or any context,  but it's quite telling how their instantaneous reaction to their children testing positive was to blame it on them for not wearing masks and then violently attack them for it. </p>
<p>Where do you suppose she got that message? üôÑ</p>

        <p>I almost wonder if this was just the story she told police to justify her abuse or gain sympathy. She sounds like a horrible person who would‚Äôve beat her kids on any given day for any reason.</p>

        <p>Sadly she might have a good defense come trial. Adults can hit their kids as discipline and children actually cannot raise self defense against simple battery. Typically slaps and kicks are not considered aggravated battery. The law favors parents who hit their kids basically. If this got bad press she they may go forward on her.</p>

        <p>If my kid tested positive, then I will just assume I already got it and stay home for ten days. Pretty sure I'd be forced to anyway lol. No masks. No staying apart. Not even going to scrub the house. Never did that for the flu. Not going to start now.</p>

<p>Literally all I had to do was read the article to figure out that it wasn't because "masks = cult" but in fact because she was a <strong>fucking alcoholic</strong></p>
<p>Nice try though üëç</p>
