    <strong>“Covid hits a Wall” by Miles Mathis. The Crimes Against Humanity lawsuit against those promoting COVID.</strong>
    <p><p><a href="http://mileswmathis.com/covid3.pdf">http://mileswmathis.com/covid3.pdf</a></p>
<p>On October 3, this video at youtube [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0M1qsGN1mc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0M1qsGN1mc</a>]  was posted by the spokesman [Dr. Reiner Fuellmich] for an international team of lawyers and scientists who are filing Crimes Against Humanity lawsuits against those promoting Covid. I suggest you watch it and spread it. Even if these guys turn out to be controlled opposition—and for now I don't think they are—this announcement is important because it confirms that top people agree with us that the Covid crisis has been a manufactured scam. They call it the greatest crime against humanity ever committed.“</p>
<p>“...among the many things Dr. Fuellmich confirms are that the mortality of Covid is no higher than the seasonal flu, and may actually be less. </p>
<p>Also that the hospitals that were supposed to be overflowing were actually almost empty. Also that films from hospitals were faked. </p>
<p>Also that the panic was created on purpose, in order to promote vaccines and other agendas. </p>
<p>Also that the WHO, CDC, and other major governmental bodies worldwide have lied at the behest of foundations and corporations that control them. </p>
<p>Also that almost everyone who has died was very old and had pre- existing conditions, again indicating the mortality of Covid is extremely low. </p>
<p>Also that the Covid test was not created to diagnose or confirm Covid, as its inventor admits and as is admitted in its own literature—including inserts that come with it—and in the CDC's own publications. That is, a positive result does not indicate infection with anything. It can give a positive result on anyone who has ever had a cold. Also that doctors have been instructed to assign deaths to Covid, whether that was truly indicated or not. </p>
<p>Also that doctors and officials were PAID to list deaths as Covid when they were not. </p>
<p>Also that government bodies recommended that no autopsies be performed in Covid cases, in order to hide the fact that Covid was NOT the cause. </p>
<p>Also that those in media and government—when confronted with this evidence—had been instructed not to argue facts, but instead to label the opposition as conspiracy theorists and treat them as cranks, even when they were tenured professors at Stanford or Nobel Prize winners. Sound familiar? </p>
<p>Also that orders from the CDC and governors have been completely unConstitutional, bypassing our legislative system completely and therefore our right to representation. </p>
<p>Also that courts at all levels have utterly failed to protect our rights and uphold the Constitution, undermining their basic function. </p>
<p>Also that all these actions above constitute massive centralized fraud and intent to cause harm. </p>
<p>Also that provable harm—including complicity in mass murder—has been done on a worldwide scale, hence the Crimes Against Humanity tag...”</p></p>

        <p>I read news specific to Italy every day. Their case numbers have jumped considerably. I’ve made the easy assumption that they are running their tests at a higher cycle rate now then they were just a few weeks ago. There’s no reason for the spike they’ve had. Well. There’s no sane reason for the spike in cases anywhere unless you factor in more testing and higher cycle rates. </p>
<p>They’ve made it mandatory for anyone visiting them from certain countries to have negative tests before entering the country, they’ve made masks outside mandatory country wide, and the president(?) has suggested, recently, that people wear masks in their homes. </p>
<p>Deaths have not spiked, just like everywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>Miles Mathis is a complicated man with a very simple message. Everything we see on the MSM is fake, everyone is in on it and related to each other, and it’s all heading towards the totalitarian state. While I dispute that EVERYTHING is fake, his analytical style was made for 2020, and his analysis on COVID has been from the outset pitch perfect.  </p>
<p>Whether these lawsuits are controlled opposition or not, the hope is that deposing key officials under oath will at least result in further confessions of malfeasance and releases of information into the public domain (not that most of humanity would care at this point).</p>

        <p>This could overlap almost identically with the 'science' (more like <em>pseudo</em>science) of global warming, where for decades the narratives, threats, warnings, and deadlines have all shifted, changed, and morphed over the years. </p>
<p>Covid is a condensed timeframe of how Global Warming has been playing out with all the same political, scientific, and misinformation based on  half-truths and a complicit media who benefits equally with politicians from the fear-porn panic parade.</p>

        <p>Miles Mathis is a looney tune who can't even handle basic math concepts.  I wouldn't use him as a poster boy for anything unless you're doing it for entertainment value.</p>
