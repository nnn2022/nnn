    <strong>Covidiots Observation</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m part of the r/covidiots subreddit because I was curious to see what they were saying. The amount of posts they steal from this sub and turn around makes me think they’re actually kind of obsessed with us, and that’s flattering. Imagine having such a lack of imagination and creativity that you have to bash other people’s discussion posts and the most you have to say is “wOw ThEy’Re So DuMb” in various ways. There is very little rational discussion. It’s painful to see through the lies, the fearmongering, and the propaganda, but I’d much rather be on this side. I was just looking at the post where they took The Walking Dead picture and they were like “haha well they will have the disease”. Sick argument, bruh.</p></p>

        <p>I honestly cannot imagine having absolutely no questions or curiosity at this point. I can chat with someone who is pro covid vax and I am not and I don't need to call them a moron or an idiot even though I disagree with taking it. I think when you are this invested in a story, it's been controlling your life for an entire year.... Anything contradicting it is going to cause a strong reaction. You can be presented with viewpoints from real experts and if they are fact checked or their reputation is smeared its prob a relief to you to think you haven't been played or wasted a year of your life to fear and control. If you are accepting everything your government is telling you no matter how contradictory it is its time to step back and rethink things a bit and look at some different viewpoints with an open mind</p>

        <p>I saw a tweeter yesterday calling the attendees of the church (that had the fence put around it in Alberta) a "cult" and "Branch Covidians". </p>
<p>I was like WTF you unoriginal POS... that's what we call YOU! Stop stealing our lines!</p>
<p>I guess if Facebook doesn't hashtag it for them, they wouldn't know what to come up with on their own.</p>

        <p>The sad thing is, it's not just that subreddit. Most of those folks are on the left where things like rational debate and logic is dying out. It's just a big machine saying "do this" and "think that" and all the pieces of the machine know how to do is to listen. There's no original thought, or creativity to be found in their ideas. They're subreddit steals from this one because all they do over there is regurgitate what CNN tells them. That's what they know.</p>

        <p>Yeah it’s been strange all that. I think that “be the change you want to see in the world” saying is actually something.. </p>
<p>Like you can choose what you focus your energy on and that has an effect on your experience.. and what energy you are putting out into the world. 
I think my approach is to try and put out good ripples as a posed to re affirming the bad stuff.
Not sure if this makes sense I’m pretty high sorry. :)</p>

        <p>They are no different then the forums that used to exist to mock fat people.   Being mean to fat people isn’t as acceptable as it used to be, so they found a new group that society thinks it’s acceptable to bully.  Also, many of them are disgusting cowards who take sneak pictures and post semi-private things while not having the nerve to confront the people that they have a problem with in person.</p>
