    <strong>Covid-19 vax vs. first new Alzheimers drug in 2 decades</strong>
    <p><p>Let's do some <em>math</em>:</p>

<p>EQUALS:</p>
<p>&rt;Scientists have discovered a surprising link between Alzheimer's disease and mad cow disease. It turns out both diseases involve something called a prion protein.</p>

<p>UPDATE: At the end of May 2021, Biden said, "If we don't act now, every hospital bed in America will be filled with Alzheimers patients in 15 years!" -- you can add that to the list of curious happenings...</p></p>

        <p>Great post, this connection has been under-analyzed.  The timing of the questionable alzheimer's drug with the  questionable vax causing prion disease is beyond coincidence.</p>

        <p>You know -- if it was the only coincidence I might not be so skeptical, but there are too many "coincidences" to count.</p>
<p>When you put the entire Covid-19 timeline into perspective there is no question. It is too much for one person to keep in their head at once, so most people don't.</p>
<p>As one lockdown enthusiast said to me recently, "I'm not reading that. Too much text." And... here we are today.  A natural consequence of the dumbing down of our entire nation and short-attention-spanification of media. Screen addition. Media hypnosis. Politicization of a health issue to get people on board with agendas they'd never support otherwise...</p>

        <p>I think it goes further than that - I've realized a lot of smart people have dumbed down as well --- I think this might just be a product of a highly specialized society -- too many people I meet are extremely intelligent.... in ONE subject, and show no intellectual curiosity whatsoever to be multi-disciplinary - if this weren't true and other intelligent people spent time learning about more than their little bubble of a world, they wouldn't necessarily just go with the flow and the knowledge you can find just by informing yourself a bit would be much more mainstream --- too many damn smart people I've seen say things like "leave that to the doctors/biologists/physicists" i mean comon guys learn a little.... but nooo--oooo they turned that part of their brain off when they specialized in a field or left college or something... :(</p>

        <p>YES!  People who are ridiculously smart in other ways simply turn off their brains and accept the narrative on covid.  My assessment is that this has to be a the result of an extensive,  deep, and coercive psychological manipulation. But, alas, I still don't understand why.</p>

        <p>Again, brilliant.  Critical thought is not only undervalued,  but discouraged.  The second I saw the Alzheimer's drug approval I had blaring internal alarms, but most people just don't care.  It's all masked in the cognitive dissonance at this point, so easily hidden as you mention.  Great thoughts, thank you.</p>

        <p>The relationship of prion and Alzheimer's known.  Biden also recently let it slip that, paraphrasing, in 15 years every hospital bed will be taken up by an Alzheimer's patient.  We have also seen side effects of the vax being neurological,  which I interpret as some people being particularly vulnerable to this effect that will take longer for most.  </p>
<p>So, knowing that an Alzheimer's pandemic is on the way, courtesy of the vax, it makes sense to have a drug ready for the right people to make $$$.  I don't know enough about the drug yet to make an assessment about its effects, but I've read it is seriously questioned even in the mainstream.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the explanation.  Stepping back from this, I have to wonder if the government/powers that be are truly willing to knowingly infect people on this big of a scale with something that will give them alzheimers in the future.  It's just hard to believe that they'd do that as people would be able to figure out that they did it and they'd likely be held accountable or just killed by random pissed off people.</p>

        <p>Yep, I have the same problem with this concept.  I try to approach it from what I know to be truth and then extrapolate.  For example: I know they don't actually care about our well-being.  I know they lied about the origin of the virus.  I know they lied about the effectiveness of masks. I know they lied about the necessity of masks.  I know they lied about the lethality of the virus.  I know they lied about the reliability of PCR tests.  I know they lied about case numbers.  I know they are lying about vax side effects.  I know they are lying about the vax superseding natural immunity.   So, when they tell me I have to get the vax, I know they are lying.  I don't pretend to understand their motive, but I know it can't be good.  I think the problem is I don't comprehend that people can be as inherently evil as they are so I'm programmed to reject that line of thinking as fallacy.</p>
