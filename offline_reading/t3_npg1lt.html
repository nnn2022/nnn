    <strong>Happy memorial day</strong>
    <p><p>Happy memorial day. Time to get drunk and feast on chemical filled crap while sitting on your ever growing fat ass and pretend to give a shit about the men and women who gave thier lives so you could live in this new normal.</p>
<p>God our forfathers would spit on us. We let the gov tax us to death. Use the money to fund experimental drug treatments. Let them lock us in cages and ban us from work because we do not follow thier broken laws. </p>
<p>How many millions of people are sitting around useing today as an excuse to eat and do drugs while neglecting the gift that we are letting slip threw our fingers.</p>
<p>I have never had it tough. But I can imagine picking up a gun and going into fight just to have my arms blown off and bleeding out. For what? To protect the people I love. Hundreds of thousands of people have done that to give you freedom in America. Now look at us. We are laughing at them. They gave everything for us and we are pissing on thier corpses.</p>
<p>No respect. Its just horrible. Millions are just walking into the goverments arms without question. We are letting them take every single right we have. Free speech. Baring arms. Personal sovereignty. Just throwing it in the trash so we can go get drunk at a music festival. </p>
<p>So just remember next time someone is trying to make you violate your beliefs. Remember that men have died for you. They watched thier bodies bleed out onto the grass to give you a chance to do what you want. Do not let thier sacrifice be in vain. Call on them for thier strength.</p>
<p>We have gotten soft. We need to remember the raw power that we all have. We are all capable of leaving it all on the court. Do not let them break you. Take the option off the table. It is your ordained right to do what you feel is right to your body.</p>
<p>The sheep are the weak ones. They have gave in. You have not. Do not forget that.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid. We are on the right side of history. Even if they stomp us out and rewrite the book to make us look bad. The gods will know. The men who died for you will know.</p>
<p>So happy memorial day. Just remember that we have been given the most costly gift that can be given by another person. Thier time on this earth cut short so we could have freedom.</p>
<p>Thank you, god bless every person who dared question athority. Who believed in themselfs so deeply they were willing to die a gory death to make thier voice heard. I will not forget your sacrifice. ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡·</p></p>

        <p>That's why more need to know, it's a racket. </p>
<p>It was written by a man that had to find out the hard way, I'll admit I had to find out the hard way, millions of us found out the hard way. We are remembering millions that didn't live to find out at all. (&amp; some that did, but was too late to matter)</p>
<p>So... For them, should we carry on the racket or tell the young now?</p>

        <p>To often our senses are taken advantage of and redirected to do the work of the corrupt leaders.</p>
<p>Ill just call it as i see it. If you went to afganastan then that was wrong. After 5 years it was clear there was no reason to be there.</p>
<p>Idk. It is still right to remember those who truly thought they were doing good.</p>
<p>But yes tell young people that the wars that are started under this goverment are for money and not freedom.</p>

        <p>No absolutly. Its horrible.</p>
<p>I am a sucker for the revolutionary war farmers. There were just guys who decided they were not gonna deal with it anymore. </p>
<p>People like that. Not this new call of duty generation who wants to go play with guns and tanks.</p>

        <p>NASCAR does a great job of honoring fallen service members... Sunday Coke 600 all the drivers run patriotic paint schemes with the name of a fallen hero on the windshield banner... not to mention the pre race ceremonies as well, the National Anthem, Amazing Grace, current military servicemen and women roll out the giant flag on the infield... and during driver introductions, every driver is introduced by a different soldier.... the flyby of the jets over the track from the local airforce base...</p>

<p>Wish more sports and mainstream events displayed as much patriotism but we got pussies in football who donâ€™t stand for the national anthem.</p>
