    <strong>I hate it that people just choose about what deaths to care about based on their convenience.</strong>
    <p><p>My country has had 98 deaths from covid in total. 98. Let that sink in. Average age was 73, youngest person (46) supposedly had cancer but the media refuses to say it, one 98 year old with supposedly 'no underlying conditions' (that's literally not possible), and the rest all had unnamed 'underlying health conditions' which includes cancer and heart conditions.</p>
<p>Had to witness another local article about how people who even question lockdowns are pure psychopaths that don't care about the vulnerable, and, 'what if it was your grandma?'.</p>
<p>Today a protest group (for more restrictions), placed 98 black chairs outside parliament to symbolise the covid deaths.</p>
<p>These people had the audacity to say that those who died of covid are being treated as 'statistics' and that the effect is being magnified by stating that they had underlying health conditions</p>
<p>If I were to die by suicide, drug overdose, car crash, cancer, the flu, AIDS, falling etc. etc. no one would put out a black chair for me.  Kids starving in Africa are too usual now, soldiers dying for foreign wars are forgotten, the war on drugs has failed, suicide is a total choice so why care about those people, kids dying of abuse is too horrible to even comprehend so we deny it ever happens. Suddenly covid death is the only death that matters.</p>
<p>I hate it that these people care only about what deaths are nearest to them or impact them the most and don't even admit it and insist that everyone should care about these deaths.</p></p>

        <p>Very well said. There have been plenty of doctors and others who have warned about the increase in suicide, child abuse, and domestic violence but the government doesn’t care. And some individuals don’t care. How can you care more about covid spreading than children being abused or wives being beaten and people giving up on living? How? Even the covid deaths aren’t more important than these things. No death is worse than another. Death is still death. And what is even more outrageous is that some are more worried about getting sick than someone committing suicide.</p>

        <p>I disagree, some deaths are worse than others. A 98 year old dying is called the human lifespan. A 31 year old mother who dies bc cancer treatment was stopped thanks to Cv19 precautions is a needless tragedy. </p>
<p>Some kids and young/middle aged adults are not getting critical surgeries bc somehow, someway an elderly person might get it. </p>
<p>We as a society need to be honest with ourselves-old people die. My grandpa is 81. His parents lived to be abt 83. He is most likely about to clock out soon. People dont live forever.</p>

        <p>That's the problem, we keep agreeing with them and say they care. They don't care. They're obsessed because it feeds into their obsessive need to stay in the house and comply. Why? Not sure, maybe it's easier than actually acting like a productive member among others.</p>

        <p>You're right about that.  No one gives a shit about anyone who dies of covid.  They only pretend to.  They really only care about the number of the people who die of covid.  For all of their ranting, all the covid victims boil down to a tally.  That is how disgusting these people are.</p>

        <p>Yes.  They love the tally because it was a numerical example of why Trump is bad.  Somebody actually tried to argue we only would have had a few thousand deaths under Hillary, lol.</p>
