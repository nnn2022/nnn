    <strong>Enough is Enough</strong>
    <p><p>People are having horrible reactions to these covid shots.</p>
<p>People are complaining of migraines, Menstrual cycles  that don’t stop, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, allergic shock, passing out, blood clots....</p>
<p>My question is, what are we going to do about this!? Enough is enough. These shots are poisonous and making people sick.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you all, but I don’t have a quarter of $1 million to take an ambulance ride to the hospital for testing after I have a shitty reaction to an unknown substance.
There’s nothing the doctors can do once you’ve been injected anyway. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube.</p>
<p>This has got to stop and it has to stop now.
They’re lining up the kids for these shots right now.</p></p>

        <p>I've done a good job of taking care of my health for the last 50 years by, first, avoiding doctors and never taking another vaccine.  Outcome: My family is still full of major health issues, but I stand out like a healthy thumb.  Now they expect me betray vows I made over 5 DECADES AGO, and allow my blood to be POLLUTED with foreign bodies that, CERTAINLY,  will shorten my life and make me ill.  This is wrong!  Where are all the TRUE Democrat and Republican health fanatics?  We need to join AS ONE on this issue before it is too late.</p>
