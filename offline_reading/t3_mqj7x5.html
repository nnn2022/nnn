    <strong>Rebuttals to pro-vaccination/passport debates</strong>
    <p><p>I hope this post provides someone with a source or two that's helpful in future discussions :) I'd love for you to drop any tips or citings that have made the most impact during covid debates of differing viewpoints.</p>
<p>*BTW this turned out way longer than intended lol </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>🔴 ~ Claims that covid passports will help keep everyone safe ~ </p>
<p>The cancel culture applied to anyone questioning the safety of these vaccines is dangerous to society, the approval of Covid passports even more so. This was demonstrated just last week with the volcanic eruption in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/TABYTCHI/status/1380705095092998145?s=20</p>
<p>This is one of the many implications of Covid passports. The video above is of a CBS reporter broadcasting that only vaccinated citizens are being evacuated to escape the Caribbean volcanic eruption. Below is a link to an MSN article stating that Carnival is the only cruise line that's chosen not to bar non-vaccinated citizens, but even so it's likely they still were, as demonstrated under this Carnival announcement:</p>
<p>"Carnival has not made vaccines a requirement of this humanitarian mission. Government officials in St. Vincent have offered to do their best to make sure all who board our ships will be tested and vaccinated but that is at their initiative."</p>
<p>https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/volcano-on-caribbean-s-st-vincent-erupts-evacuation-underway/ar-BB1fs33s</p>
<p>Additionally, designated shelter hotels are requiring vaccination upon arrival. The actions of the government are deplorable regardless but even more tyrannical considering the lack of approval for children &amp; pregnant women to even take the vaccination in the first place.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>🔴 ~ Claims that vaccination will bring us back to "normalcy"~ </p>
<p>The CDC states a few interesting points about what fully vaccinated people should continue to do:</p>
<p>• Wear a mask &amp; social distance in public</p>
<p>• Avoid gatherings that are medium or large in size</p>
<p>A weird thing they get a pass on however is not needing to get tested before departing or returning from the US or domestic travel. In fact you can even refrain from getting tested if you were exposed to covid directly..  it seems that the biggest benifit of vaccination at this point is abstaining from getting tested for covid. Now isn't it odd that you should avoid gatherings &amp; still social distance but ironically you get a free pass on covid testing even when going abroad, across the state &amp; being in a crowded airport?</p>

<p>🔴 ~ Claims that approved covid vaccinations are safe &amp; effective ~ </p>
<p>These vaccines are not an FDA approved medical product but considered experimental &amp; given an Emergency Authorization of use.</p>
<p>https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization</p>
<p>So why are these vaccines considered unapproved medical products? This is due to many reasons &amp; include the potential of your body developing an autoimmune response to the vaccine, Anti-body dependant enhancement (especially young children) &amp; holding RNA code stability that would otherwise render the vaccine useless.</p>

<p>🔴 ~ Claims that the vaccines are backed by science ~ </p>
<p>Not only are the implementation of these vaccines unprecedented in medical history, but the so-called "trials" were completed in record timing. Typically vaccines are developed in 10-15 years, the covid vaccines were produced in mere months. You might have read reports that covid vaccines have been in the works for a while now, which is the reason we were able to produce them on such short notice. This convenient narrative masks the fact that previous coronavirus vaccines never passed the pre-clinical research stage. The animal trials have failed, caused worsening symptoms &amp; fatal side effects.</p>
<p>Historically, after successfully completing pre-clinical trials, vaccines spend 6-7 years in clinical trials on human subjects. They then submit their report to the FDA for approval. Since previous coronavirus vaccines never made it passed pre-clinical trials the current vaccines skipped every step along the way. Even though it was largely irrelevant, many pharmaceutical companies ran partial animal trials alongside their human trials during the 2020 covid19 vaccine development. Since the vaccines massively sidestepped the development process, they are not approved by the FDA but given the green light by "Emergency Authorization".</p>

<p>🔴  ~ Claims that the vaccination wouldn't have been given Emergency Authorization of use unless safe  ~ </p>
<p>The safty of covid vaccines were pushed aside during the competition to produce one for a worldwide pandemic. Rather than focusing on safety regulation the health laws were torn down in a heated "race to the moon". Russia arrived first &amp; everyone else tumbled in after. Every country claims theirs is best and practically throws the excess at less developed countries. Even China is donating millions of doses to other countries despite their refusal to be transparent on the vaccine trial data. Many citizens are overwhelmed by the pandemic itself and would rather trust that the government has our best interests at heart. Those that wish to be accurately informed will find an abundance of red flags but are silenced if they speak of it. Prior to the "Plublic Trust" campaigns that governments implemented to rally vaccination support, mainstream news organizations coverage of the vaccine programs were much less propagandist in nature.</p>

<p>There are tons of similar articles from last year so If you want additional citings I'll be happy to dig up more. It's important to be informed when the government is spending millions to control public opinion.. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>🔴 ~ Claims that the vaccine side effects are minor and the protection it provides against covid is worth the risk ~ </p>
<p>The factors holding back previous RNA vaccine approval have shown up in the approved commercial batches. Unfortunately the feirce competition &amp; billions invested have motivated governments to hide these findings from the general public. so far we've only seen what's been leaked or given info on "rare" complications. The pharmaceutical companies aren't held responsible, even the vaccines with defects/complications are still on the market &amp; there is little to no public disclosure regarding the efficiency &amp; dangers the vaccines could pose.</p>

<p><strong><em>Some additional info to cite for the most recent vaccination scandals</em></strong></p>
<p>🔴 ~ Pfizer controversy ~ 🔴</p>
<p>**I was banned from r/covidvaccinated for this report so tread carefully. </p>
<p>In addition to the email leaks that I included in the previous dialog (regarding Pfizer's initial commercial production batch m-RNA stability issues) Israel conducted a study on Pfizer that Dr. Fauci claims misleadingly "made it seem like you were more likely to get the [B.1.]351 if, in fact, you were vaccinated against the mRNA". </p>
<p>"The researchers identified eight cases of breakthrough infections caused by the B.1.351 variant and 134 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant out of the roughly 400 people included in the study who had tested positive for the virus during or after the vaccination period. The control group of unvaccinated people oddly had only one case caused by B.1.351" Dr. Fauci instead proposes that "Breakthrough infections can also occur if immunity wanes, the shot is damaged because of something like a storage issue, or someone’s age or medications limit their immune response"</p>
<p>Sources ⬇️ </p>
<p>https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/an-israeli-study-says-a-covid-19-variant-can-still-infect-vaccinated-people-%E2%80%94-heres-what-fauci-says-the-research-means/ar-BB1fAb2m</p>
<p>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/an-israeli-study-says-a-covid-19-variant-can-still-infect-vaccinated-people-heres-what-dr-fauci-says-the-research-means-11618263415</p>
<p>In conclusion, Dr. Fauci's reasoning for Israel's breakthrough infections supports the findings of m-RNA instability within the Pfizer email leak while also posing concerns on mutation efficacy. That being said, the narrative on breakthrough infections is changing. Until recently it was reported to be very unusual to get covid after vaccination. Now there is a need for it to be normalized as seen in the link below:
 https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/04/13/986411423/a-mystery-under-study-how-why-and-when-covid-vaccines-arent-fully-protective</p>
<p>🔴 ~ J&amp;J controversy ~ 🔴</p>
<p>Many are arguing that the concerns of J&amp;J correlations to blood clots are overrated since only 6 cases have been officially disclosed. For example, I have seen the following argument:</p>
<p>"To put this into perspective, the CDC says that 30 people out of 100,000 die of blood clots every year in the U.S. At 6 deaths for 6.8 million doses given, that puts the death rate at 0.088 people out of every 100,000 J&amp;J vaccine doses given so far in the U.S.  To put another way, that is 0.3% of the deaths by blood clots yearly."</p>
<p>What this doesn't take into account however is that this particularly rare form of blood clotting is called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). CVST affects about 5 people per 1 million each year (<em>other medical journals/studies say 3-4/year but I'm citing Hopkins estimates to avoid disagreements</em>) &amp; has severe mortality rates. The J&amp;J recipients have accounted for 20% of yearly CVST occurances in ONE MONTH alone. These initial reported cases will continue to rise as additional reports are collected &amp; recent recipients are evaluated.</p>
<p>**What really bothers me is the way the media words the reports of CVST from J&amp;J. They make it sound like it's an extremely rare side effect when what they are actually saying it's an extremely rare form of blood clotting. </p>

<p>🔴 ~ That's all for Now! ~ 🔴</p>
<p>If you made it through all this info congrats! There are a lot of bots and shills hired to drive a narrative. After all, funding to build public vaccine "trust" was one of Biden's first executive orders. I'm impartial to party politics as this initiative spanned both administrations. Spreading awareness &amp; knowledge at a time like this should be a shared responsibility. However, it's also exhausting so having presourced citings &amp; sharing info helps a ton. </p>
<p>Keep on keepin' on 😄</p></p>
