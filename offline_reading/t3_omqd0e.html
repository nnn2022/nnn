    <strong>High-Quality Remote / Virtual Homeschool Recommendation?</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, maybe it's strange I am asking this here, but I actually think education and conspiracy are related, that being said - I am searching for a good option for my kids not to brainwash them with distancing, masks, etc.</p>
<p>We have 4-year-old son and  6-year-old daughter, they spent around 2 years  in Montessori school in  South America. Half of that in the school, half  of that remotely, and  we liked remotely a lot because we could be  independent of the place.  Kids enjoyed a lot, it was great, each kid had a dedicated teacher, and  they were sending a weekly plan and materials.</p>
<p>Now  school is back to onsite, but we liked remote a lot, so we are now  searching some great international school, that is widely accepted, high  quality, with great programs, basically the best there is, and we have  no idea where to start searching.</p>
<p>Can  you please recommend some outstanding remote school (English speaking) that can work with kids all over the world and with great programs and  service? We would like to sign up ASAP.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></p>

        <p>Are you specifically looking for a program with teachers and curriculum already made that your kids can do on the computer, or are you interested in curriculum you would teach them? I’m not sure whether they have groups in South America, but when I have kids, I am seriously considering classical conversations. You teach your kids the curriculum after purchasing the books, and then they have community group once a week, and it looks like a really incredible program, with a tiered approach to a classical education, Including Latin instruction, which I think is really cool.</p>

        <p>We want to teach them, we basically just need a program / instructions / materials and once a week consultation, yes. What's the name of the service / school / group you are referring to?</p>

        <p>The name is Classical Conversations. They have materials for I think age 4 through 18, and you could even purchase college credit for the high school level classes. They have a once a week meeting, and from what I’ve researched their curriculum looks really awesome</p>

        <p>Subjective and less than a partial answer, I hope it helps:</p>
<p>I think classical education is a good old programme.Trivium: grammar, logic, rhetoricfollowed byQuadrivium: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, musicIn modern subjects, grammar would be reading and listening and contain both syntax and vocabulary; logic the crossroad of philosophy, mathematics and computer science; rhetoric writing and speaking, arithmetic and geometry mathematics, astronomy physics or science.</p>
<p>A mathematics education where one makes proofs rather than accepting some given rules or formula as truth is important in my opinion and experience. One does not learn by heart what some teacher, book or authority says but discovers the truth himself/herself by questioning and convinces and is convinced by a demonstration. I guess AMS must have books for math ed with proofs.</p>
<p>Few countries have philosophy education before college/university, but learning about rationalism, empiricism etc. from pre-Socratics to analytic philosophy might be useful as well as questioning everything. Note that philosophy departments with strong analytic tradition have been (were?) the last castle of humanities (along with psychology) against PoMo/woke BS.</p>
<p>Not directly but I have a hunch that art/music/dance ed may also be related, aesthetics from renaissance painters to impressionists been the highest we got and with the decline in their appreciation, now PoMo art is exactly the contrary. I see a similar pattern in music from classical, jazz and rock with sophisticated compositions and the mastery of instruments to commercial pop and electronic music without any of these. Same from classical dances to twerk shitshow.</p>
<p>For home-schooling better determine the curriculum and skills to be obtained.</p>

        <p>Are any private schools seriously mandating masks this year? I know some public schools are, but part of the appeal of private schools is that they won’t do that crap  this year.</p>

        <p>They do because it's mandated by the government. So tables with 2 meters apart, masks, etc. It's just a question of time when they will ask kids to be injected with shit.</p>
