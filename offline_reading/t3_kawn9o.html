        <p>Yum, more argument facts.</p>
<p>I knew it was bullshit.</p>
<p>Why isn't this compulsive lying freaking the NPCs out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they are brainwashed into thinking we are all right wing neonazi trumpsters, conspiracy theorists, anti vaxxer (they are bad, remember), anti science (because anything officially issued is good and everything else should be SILENCED) painting us as horrible people. And the moderation here LISTENS to them and does its best to silence.</p>
<p><strong>when in reality, we are upset citizens first and foremost.</strong>  </p>
<p>I find it REALLY WEIRD that ALL mainstream subreddits and all region specific forums are pro lockdown and pro censorship.</p>

        <p>My wife is a nurse practitioner. She works at an ICU hospital, meaning every patient is an ICU patient. All three floors are ICU and all rooms are ICU. She has worked in the emergency room in past years and she has worked on ICU floors at traditional hospitals in past years. </p>
<p>She and I have talked about this particular topic on more than one occasion. ICUs being at full capacity is a pretty normal thing. In fact, hospitals don't mind having their ICUs at full capacity. They make hospitals a lot of money. My wife's facility is always at 100% capacity. Every room and every bed always has someone in them. How they have managed to make this such a big issue is astonishing.</p>
<p>Hospitals, emergency rooms and ICUs being at 100% capacity is not some big abnormality. Emergency rooms have been diverting to other emergency rooms, because they were full, well before covid existed. Hospitals have had people laying on beds, in hallways, until a room opened up, well before covid existed. And, ICUs being at full is nothing new. The only thing that is new is, the media doing stories on it.</p>

        <p>Well it's Newsom's new criteria for lockdown. Lockdown if they're at more than 85% occupancy.</p>

        <p>In all fairness about every other year or maybe every third we get headlines from ICU doctors and hospital administrators that they "fear they will be overwhelmed by the unprecedented flu season".   Last time was 2018, but who can remember back that far?</p>
