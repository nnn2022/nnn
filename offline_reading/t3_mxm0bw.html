        <p>From the source:</p>
<p>&rt;Beri's family have paid tribute after she died of a suspected heart attack days after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine. </p>
<p>&rt;Beri's mother Lesley Evans, 76, told MailOnline: ‘I don’t even know what to say – I am so angry that this has happened to my beloved girl.</p>
<p>&rt;Lesley added: ‘Covid-19 has turned all of our lives upside down in a way that we never imagined, and now it’s safe to say that we won’t even be able to say goodbye to our daughter.                </p>
<p>&rt;’I am just so furious that they keep pushing this vaccine out there when people are at risk due to unknown underlying conditions. Beri was healthy and living a life full of love and adventure.' </p>

        <p>What was suspicious about the heart attack?  Did they think that they were less likely to get a heart attack after the vaccine?  People get heart attacks thats normal, before and after getting vaccinated.</p>
