        <p>What I'm curious about is, what is the defining factor for someone such as ourselves to look at something like a vaccine passport, and can tell immediately where this will lead, but there are people out there that completely back it up. I know people with master degrees that agree with these passports. What is the difference in the people that can connect the dots better than others? Another example are the fact checkers that have popped up in the last year. We are giving people/corporations control to say what is or isn't true. It seems obvious to me that this power given to them will be used against the population to control the flow of information and truth. Though one could say that the truth has continuously been hidden from the population for longer than we could imagine. 
My question lies. How can some see through the veil with ease. While others can't connect the dots?</p>
