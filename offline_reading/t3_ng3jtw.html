    <strong>They Can't Cure Cancer But They Can Cure Covid?</strong>
    <p><p>Well, "cure" is a strong word for it but are you seriously fucking telling me that within a couple of months not one but a couple of vaccines are developed to combat this fucking thing - a uNpReCeDeNTeD nOvEL vIrUs which still hasn't even been isolated - when scientists are still scratching their fucking heads on how to develop a cure for cancer? Something which kills far more fucking people by the way and has been around for decades.</p>
<p>Get the fuck outta here. You're really gonna turn around and tell me that "tHeY pOoLeD tOGeTheR tO sAvE mAnKiNd FrOM CoViD!" How in the FUCK do you see these people as benevolent and well-intentioned? If they were able to craft this fucking shit in months then they should pull their fucking fingers out their asses and get on developing a cure or vaccine or whatever the fuck for cancer or Parkinsons or any of the other fucking life threatening diseases and viruses out there. </p>
<p>THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT COVID OR YOU OR GRANDMA OR ANY OF THE FUCKING SHIT THEY HAVE BEEN PEDDLING FOR THE PAST YEAR. WAKE FUCKING UP!</p></p>

        <p>They don't want a cure for cancer. They are not looking for a cure for cancer. </p>
<p>Cures were never the business model of western allopathic medicine. A life long subscription of drugs is what pays off. This is why all medicines are for "Treatment of", not "Cure of".</p>
<p>FYI, cancer is the final stage of toxification, when the body can no longer get rid of/correct a toxemia/imbalance, and creates an overgrowth to encapsule the toxification. All cancer drugs, like most drugs, are just symptom suppressors, unable to remove the cause of cancer, and in fact all cause cancer themselves.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The idea that they could have vaccines for COVID, while so many other diseases still dont have cures makes no sense st all.   </p>
<p>Are we supposed to believe they developed these vaccines so quickly, <em>exactly as they predicted</em>?</p>
<p>And are we supposed to believe the cases are actually going down everywhere, because of the vaccine, <em>exactly as they predicted</em>?</p>
<p>Does not pass the smell test </p>

        <p>Ok from what I understand cancer is a disease that is a lot trickier than a virus. Cancer is your own cells going haywire after protocols to stop it fail. The drugs that are out there either manage the symptoms or try to kill the cancer cells whilst also killing normal cells because so far we haven't found a way to only target cancer cells AFAIK. Also basically all of the world started concentrating on finding a vaccine for COVID since it affected everyone, so all the resources got pooled towards that. If the same resources got invested into cancer, the progress would be a lot faster, but since it doesn't affect everyone, there is no incentive to pour all those resources into it.</p>

<p>This is the part I get hung up on. An astronomical amount of people die of cancer every year. They should pool all their resources into it. They've had plenty of years prior to this "pandemic" to do so. How can they care about this but at the same time callously disregard all of the people that have died or will die from cancer?</p>

        <p>From what I think: Cancer is a thing that's been around for a long time, and it doesn't affect us in the way that COVID did. Cancer is not contagious and didn't force us into lockdowns and cause a whole lot of problems. Also, cancer isn't the only deadly thing; the resources that are invested into "curing" diseases are very spread out; some people research Parkinson's, some Alzheimers etc. So to pool EVERYTHING into cancer would seriously diminish research into other diseases. Also, getting everyone on the same page would be hard; how would you convince them? Also, scientists tend to research what they are interested in. A neurologist is probably more interested in Alzheimer's research than in cancer research, for example. I do understand your frustration, though,</p>

        <p>The virus has not been isolated, it has been modeled in silico, and partly based on the SARS genome, which has also not been isolated properly. It's like photoshop, but then with genetic code. All artist's impression. Give another artist the controls and he'll come up with a different sequence.</p>
<p>Isolation means separation from everything else, pure, clean, uncontaminated. They can't do this.</p>

        <p>Viruses cannot replicate without host, so they are usually isolated in a cell line. There's no point in separating the virus alone.</p>
<p>Your Photoshop analogy is misleading. If I have a horse and send you a JPEG picture of this horse, you don't have the horse. But if I have a JPEG file and send it to you, your copy is indistinguishable from mine. A virus is just an arrangement of bases, like JPEG is a collection of bits.</p>

        <p>As long as the cell lines are treated with all kinds of chemicals that induce exosomes and have cell debris, then you cannot isolate viruses. </p>
<p>That's the point. If they cannot do it, then say they cannot. They need to find better technology to do it. Or just accept that viruses ARE our own exosomes, and that Bechamp was right, not Pasteur the fraud.</p>

        <p>conveniently forgot about the heavy metals?</p>
<p>"distinct condition" in 1789 is already false information. 
any form of childhood paralysis was labeled polio. around 1955 the disease was decimated by better diagnosis into several distinct conditions.</p>

        <p>Can I take a break from the discussion to acknowledge the sweet face-mask on your Reddit avatar? AWESOME, BRO!</p>
<p>The point of my post, which you've entirely missed, is that stuff like cancer (which is far more deadly than Covid) isn't being prioritized when it kills God knows how many people a year, yet something as benign as Covid is suddenly top priority and they're able to come up with a solution in a couple months? Smells fishy to me. And I am well aware cancer is different than a virus, it's deadlier for one thing.</p>

        <p>Sorry dude I was admiring your masked avatar.</p>
<p>&rt;I definitely didn’t miss your point, I’m literally trying to explain it <br>
to you in the best way possible. Why is COVID a priority? because COVID <br>
spreads. Basically, COVID has killed about as many people in the US as <br>
cancer has in 2020, which saying one is more important than the other is<br>
 completely irrelevant. But the fact that COVID spreads as fast as it <br>
does is the complete reason we are in quarantine and why we are <br>
scrambling for the vaccine in the first place. The Black Plague? No <br>
quarantine. Infected 30% to 60% of the entire human population. COVID? <br>
Quarantine + vaccine. 0.021 percent of the human population. Obviously, <br>
it’s important to note that there are other factors in both situations, <br>
but you get the idea.</p>
<p>How many of those who died WITH Covid had cancer I wonder? I bet they were counted as Covid cases, considering the overwhelming majority of Covid cases had FOUR comorbidities.</p>
<p>You're really comparing the BLACK PLAGUE with Covid? LMFAO. The two aren't even in the same league. </p>
<p>All the quarantine bullshit barely helped, otherwise people wouldn't have caught the fucking thing and it wouldn't have spread. I know people who followed all the fucking rules and barely left the house and still managed to somehow get the thing (and guess what, they described it as "being like the flu").</p>

        <p>How am I being a conspiracy theorist? They have literally admitted to labelling deaths as Covid deaths if they had it in their system, regardless of whatever else they were dying from.</p>
<p>The black plague spread during a time where people lived in filth and squalor. Quite different to todays living standards.</p>
<p>You're the entitled asshole, thinking we should shut down everything and give up a year of our lives because you're scared of a virus with a 99.9% survival rate.</p>
