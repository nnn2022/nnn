    <strong>I was an enabler</strong>
    <p><p>I have to admit, for many months I believed all the lies and fearmongering. For months I restricted my life because of a disease with little to no danger to me. But enough is enough, when you start to see new contradictions and new reasons to be scared every week, you know something is wrong.</p>
<p>I stopped restricting my life. I do as I used to do before, no fear, I walk around freely breathing fresh air. I meet the friends and family that want to see me. </p>
<p>That's all you have to do. Try to reason with your friends and close family.</p>
<p>I mean, most of them are lost. My grandma even required masks on Christmas, and I wore them the minimum time I could. </p>
<p>But It's not over. They took a lot from other people, I am very lucky to not have been very affected, but I ache with all the people that have been severely affected. You just have to live life. Leave your house and take a walk, no mask. Look at all the people , scared for their life, while you breathe the fresh air. You are sane, you are healthy, and they can't take that from you. Just don't obey the rules.</p></p>

        <p>I imagine lots of people were concerned considering the fake videos from China showing people dying in the street.</p>
<p>I was super concerned back in February and March, but as more data came out, I stopped worrying. Its pretty normal to fear the unknown and how it will effect yourself and loved ones. One of the earliest outbreaks was at the Microsoft campus in the building my wife worked and her boss was refusing to let her work from home despite her job allowing for it.</p>

        <p>While the real survival rate is still unknown and there is a range of estimates, we can be very confident that it's closer to 99.9% than to 99%</p>

        <p>7m; aka one tenth of the people who would die in a  normal year anyway, and almost all of them people who had pre-existing conditions such that they were likely to have died within the next few years anyway. If you think our behaviours for this thing are justified, then you think we should behave this way for the flu and every other contagious disease...and to hell with that idea, by the way. </p>

        <p>Congrats on leaving the cult of fear and manipulation behind you and enjoy</p>
<p>I can't say 'I've been there' because even before the lockdowns began I was one of the people very concerned about what was to come - you probably looked at people like me and thought we were insane/attacked us but that's ok... it's where you are <em>now</em> that matters</p>
<p>I'm seeing what I thought were hopeless cases finally seeing through it - I had a family member back in April needed an ingredient for something and was trying to source where to get it (shortages) and I mentioned I had a brand new box they could come and get - they refused because 'I have to protect my family at all costs' - fair enough but I'm pretty much housebound atm and don't see anyone which they well know - so they decided to go to the supermarket where hundreds of people are, because the Gov said thats 'ok' 🤦🏻‍♀️</p>
<p>Well, they are now firmly against the measures and the propaganda</p>
<p>Once again, well done...breathe freely, smile, and be happy 😊</p>

        <p>I mean, I was always a skeptic but didnt pay it much attention, just did as they told me on the TV and all will be fine... I told myself, it is what it is, just 2 weeks to flatten the curve. There's no other option, this is so new and dangerous... but as the months progressed I knew that there was another option and started to see the holes in the narrative... meanwhile , It's been 8 months. 
I breathe fresh air, get out when I want and just live life... the ones that choose to restrict themselves, I pay no attention to them really.</p>

        <p>In the beginning I was scared! I mean in March and April. Didn't go to the cafetrria at my workplace etc. But I was done by the end of the summer. Only few patients in hospitals. No disaster, no friends and relatives getting sick and dying, actually no sign of covid anywhere except the headlines. I never wore the mask. In my country of 5,5 million there are 221 people hospitalized because of covid and today we were told by our ministry of social affairs and health and government they are renewing the strategy and from now on they will use restrictions even when we are at "base level", which means when there are only few infections (&lt; 10/100000 in 2 weeks). I can't understand it. WHY? We are doing fine, we have  30 patients in the ICU in the whole country, the infection rate is going down, we have started giving vaccines..And now you say desp7te of all that you will continue with this shit! This is so crazy! So unbelievable!</p>

        <p>Yep, 30 people of 5,5 million in the ICU and numbers going down and we are told we will lock down harder. And longer. </p>
<p>This is the price we pay for our governments desire to be the government coping best with coronavirus. We are told we should be proud and happy because of the good publicity and because we don't have a total lockdown, I mean we don't have curfew etc. (we have 17,64 people per sq kilometer (0,39 sq miles) so it's not hard to keep 2m distance here...Like anybody important would actually give a shit what is happening here and what are the names of our skilled politicians..</p>

        <p>I didn't wear the mask for long, I always used an excuse to take it off and at one point no one was wearing one. I drop signs and hints to the family once in a while, if they want to wake up they will. If I were to do that to everyone, I would be alone. I just let them live, and they let me live my own life.

        <p>It takes guts to accept you were wrong. It was about August/September when I jumped ship. Unfortunately people have really picked their hill to die on. It’s hard to change your stance once you’ve been admonishing people on social media since March. What upsets me so much about all this is how divisive it all is. </p>

        <p>The pandemic hysterica got me for the first 3 months. I watched the news constantly, and had to take ativan daily because of the actual panic attacks I was having. Now I've been going out every single day since June, no precautions, and my depression is gone and I'm no longer an anxious mess. It's truly sad what the media has been able to do to people</p>

        <p>The George Floyd riots were the breaking point for me. Hot damn, I've never seen virtue signalers and COVID authoritarians turn on their logic and outlook that quickly and shamelessly. There was not a single shred of self-awareness to be found, and it made my blood boil even more when public health experts said protests were acceptable</p>

        <p>Yeah I worked for an urgent care in metro Detroit and even the PAs were so over the masks and it's all coming from management... higher-up bullshit. I wore masks (not N95 although "required") to please them but shit I convinced a MA to push my flu shot down the sink and sign off for me. I'm going to be cautious around my elders but I'm not going to miss a holiday seeing them. Theres ~360 days until next Christmas and theres no guarantee she will be around for it. I'm not sitting around waiting to make more memories to please people that wouldn't care when my grandma passed or what of if it isnt "covid"</p>

        <p>I went through the same thing for the first month. After breaking down to my boyfriend, telling him I was scared, he told me how he felt about all of this and then I got to thinking. Snapping out of the fear fest has been liberating to say the least.</p>

        <p>Congratulations. I went through something similar. It was about late April, early May when I realized this was all a scam.  (I mean, yes, there is a virus,  but it's not what they say it is.)  The propaganda they put out was pretty slick.  I'd even seen the YouTubers in China "investigating" and freaked.  (Like Communist China would ever actually allow anything they didn't want to be uploaded there.) Oh, and there was some editorial in WaPo that was supposedly an account of what was going on in Italy that had really gotten to me.  And then, the next week the National Guard erected a mobile FEMA hospital a block away from my work - I saw it on the news and feared I'd end up there.  (That FEMA hospital was never used.)</p>
<p>The plus is, this whole mess brought me back to my faith.  It was the first week of May Archbishop Vigano and a bunch of cardinals and clergy, doctors,  lawyers, and journalists, etc signed and published that appeal that verified it was all a scam.  I also realized then there were still some good shepherds left in the Church.  So, yeah.</p>

        <p>So you admit masks and social distancing stop the virus from spreading. And perhaps you should blame the so called "leaders" at that outbreak of the virus who let landlords and employers screw people out of jobs and homes. Also, i have yet to meet one of you "NoNewNormal" losers who cared about the poor and mentally ill before the pandemic</p>

        <p>Lol what, do you think the government can fix lack of tourism and businesses being closed? You're the only one that wants to restrict the rights of the workers and working class. No man that wants to work and contribute to society should be prevented from doing so. Too much government intervention i guess.</p>
