    <strong>THE CHAINS OF CONFORMITY ARE CHAINING US DOWN!!!</strong>
    <p><p>This is outrageous , the government is playing chess with your mind people </p>
<p>I really wish these mask sheeple can see what‚Äôs going on </p>
<p>They are trying to establish a new order ,  compulsory mask, compulsory curfew , you aren‚Äôt allowed to go anywhere they don‚Äôt want you to!! It‚Äôs not even about security but control </p>
<p>We literally can‚Äôt go to Walmart to buy food unless we fall in to their lies </p>
<p>We have to keep fighting the good fight , this is the civil movement of our generation</p></p>

        <p>I walked into a local chain restaurant to pick up my takeout and told them I was there to pick up for Name.</p>
<p>He says "okay, uh, you're actually not allowed in here without a mask but we have a pickup window on the side of you want to go out and wait"</p>
<p>I would have just left if I hadn't already paid online. So they had me standing outside like a dumbass at a take out window that's meant for cars to drive up to. It was absurd. We won't be giving them another penny.</p>

        <p>They're honestly a big herd of running sheep üêë in those covid hysteria groups where all they do is act mildly "edgy" about being a mask wearing slave to big daddy government. Most of them have never had a critical thought in their entire life, just got fed quick "info" from the government and devoted their lives to saying we're stupid because "DaDy wOuldN't LiE".  Oh and they must be fun at parties...nothing like joining a social group where all you do is endlessly froth at the mouth about bacteria you can't even see like an 82 year old grandma üëµ those guys must have some serious testosterone üí™.....*note the sarcasm</p>
