    <strong>Depressed about mask mandate again</strong>
    <p><p>Hey, everyone. I just saw that, because of the CDC‚Äôs new recommendation that everyone wear masks regardless of vaccine status, the governor of the great state of Nevada is re-instituting mask mandates in problem counties, including Clark County (Las Vegas), where I live. This goes into effect at midnight on my birthday, and I‚Äôm just super bummed and wanted to vent to an understanding community. </p>
<p>I was all about it at first: down with lockdowns and masks and sanitizing everything I bought the second I got home from the store. I know some, maybe many, of you saw through it from the very beginning, but I was naive, trusting. But life slowly started returning to some semblance of normal‚Äînot ‚Äúnew normal,‚Äù but actual normal, where you could dine in restaurants and drink at bars and eventually even walk into a Target and look at other people‚Äôs faces and have them look at yours. I didn‚Äôt get a vaccine, and I didn‚Äôt wear a mask, and I didn‚Äôt get sick (honestly, I think I had COVID way back in January 2020, before the official narrative allows that it was here in the US). And life‚Äôs been fine. I haven‚Äôt been scared. I‚Äôve been a little harassed by some family members (some moreso than others), and I‚Äôve been a little miffed about some events that I‚Äôd wanted to go to that required proof of vaccination. But overall, I was okay. </p>
<p>Now? Maybe it‚Äôs because my mental health‚Äôs been a bit of a state lately, but this news is just extra depressing. I‚Äôm tired of this. I want what so many of the pro-vax people want: to let life go back to normal and let whatever happens happen to those of us who chose not to get the vaccine. We can‚Äôt keep living like this forever. </p>
<p>If you made it this far, thanks for listening.</p></p>

        <p>Come on man, this virus is just so incredibly dangerous.  So dangerous in fact that even though it didn't work before, we are going to try wearing masks again.  But, it's not <em>that</em> dangerous, so we're going to wait a couple of days to do it.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm bummed about it too. I really hope they don‚Äôt bring back the mask mandates where I live, but I feel for everyone who lives where they are reinstating them. It‚Äôs such bullshit and makes no sense scientifically to think you can protect yourself/others from an airborne virus with a piece of cloth. AHHHHH!!!</p>
<p>anyhow, happy early birthday friend. try to make the most of your special day!! sending you love ü•≥</p>

        <p>Right? Masks give some people the comforting illusion that something is being done about this super scary virus. It doesn‚Äôt even matter if there‚Äôs no science to back it up. It‚Äôs security theater. </p>
<p>Anyway, thanks so much! I will certainly try.</p>

        <p>FAUCI: Well, the rationale, Ari, is that we're really dealing with a different virus because when the original CDC recommendations were made that if you were fully vaccinated, you don't need to wear a mask indoor was when we had the alpha variant dominant and the delta variant being about 1- or 2% or so of the viruses in the country. Now the delta variant is totally dominant. It's well over 80-, 85%. And in some sections of the country, it's close to or above 90%. This variant is much more capable of transmitting from people to people. And we know now...</p>
<p>SHAPIRO: Even vaccinated people.</p>
<p>FAUCI: Even - well, yes, that's the point. I mean, that's the critical new information; that even though breakthrough infections among vaccinated people are rare - they still comprise a very small fraction of the infections that occur - is that when people who are vaccinated do get a breakthrough infection, we know now as a fact that they are capable of transmitting the infection to someone else. And given that that's the case, now when we're talking about vaccinated people being indoors in settings where you don't know what the status is, particularly in an area, as you mentioned correctly, that has a high degree of protection, the recommendation is that you wear a mask even indoors, even if you're vaccinated.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>I personally enjoy the lack of specifics and needing to adjust based on rare events</p>

        <p>My personal perspective which I've formed throughout all the emerging studies, data, and evidence, is that masks aren't all that effective unless they're n95's that are properly fitted. Even then there's some studies that say constant mask wearing is harmful, which I'm inclined to believe because I myself have received ppe training. So add in the lack of specifics I'm definitely brushing this off as part of their agenda. Add in the notion that the Delta variant (if it even exists) is far less fatal based on the data and on previous viral evolutions. Fauci himself also stated there's no such thing as asymptomatic transmission. Considering all of that, this discourse from Fauci is completely baseless. It just shows how propoganda works and not much else.</p>
