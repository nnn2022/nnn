    <strong>Smoke air quality dichotomy with the whole “outdoors = safe” covid propaganda</strong>
    <p><p>Long time lurker first time poster. This week has been one of the worst weeks for me of this lockdown. I’m barely holding it together. </p>
<p>With this covid hysteria, it’s all been outdoors = safe (unless it’s an anti lockdown protest of course). But now where I’m at it’s literally toxic to go outside. The air quality monitors broke the other day because the readings were so high the auto-qa rejected them. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, for restaurants technically legally you have to be in the same household to eat inside. Otherwise outdoor dining only. Besides restaurants, pretty much every indoor activity is still banned. I can go to the gym though now (as of a few weeks ago) if I wear a mask the entire time, even required while running or lifting weights. This is despite the fact that WHO recommends against mask wearing during strenuous exercise. </p>
<p>I’ve been trying to deal with the lockdown garbage by doing the activities that are allowed (and counting my blessings that it’s not Australia level lockdown yet here in US), doing things like outdoor dining or mini golf or walking in parks, but now these are all closed because of “hazardous” rated air quality. </p>
<p>So now I’ve been stuck inside for a week without being able to even go on a walk (which is one of the only government approved SAFE ™️ activities). I tried going on a quick walk a few days ago but I have asthma and was coughing up a storm so had to turn back. Literally you can’t see more than a mile here because of the smoke. </p>
<p>I feel like I’m on house arrest despite not being charged with any crime. All the fun of life has been taken away. Instead it’s just working non stop. Previous years when the smoke got bad (though never this bad) I would escape by going to the movies, bars, concerts, bowling, or other fun indoor activities. </p>
<p>Now I feel like a prisoner in my own home. My landlord who lives in the house does not allow any guests because of his irrational covid fears so I can’t have friends over. Two of my three closest friends are in the same boat (roommate or landlord won’t allow inside visitation because of covid fear). I wish I could move but economically can’t as my employer will cut pay based on cost of living and I have family obligations here. I just feel trapped. If this reaches a year I think I’ll just take my life. </p>
<p>But you know what! Smoke inhalation and wildfire deaths are at least not covid deaths! Who cares if grandma and granddaughter and fcking everyone is suicidal, better dying of suicide than a disease with a 99%+ survival rate!!  </p>
<p>Meanwhile the govt hasn’t recommended vitamin d or exercise and diet to reduce death? But I have to sacrifice my quality of life for some WALL-E level obese old people who have maybe a year left tops? I just cant come to terms with this logic. I’ve seriously lost it. Sorry for venting friends. I’m drunk (one of the countless people with YEARS of sobriety who relapsed after months of isolated forced lockdown, or course in person AA is cancelled because of lockdown) and sht posting my rage. This seems like one of the few rational places left out there.</p></p>

        <p>I’m in Oregon and it’s been my worst week, too. I’m actually extremely surprised at how it affected my mental health so quickly. Nothing seems real, it feels like war, huddled in bomb shelters. Trapped inside with the news, which is awful. </p>
<p>It’s supposed to start clearing this week, if you’re on the west coast. I am hoping my sanity comes back!</p>

        <p>Definitely. Not being able to tell the time from the smoke blocking the sun makes it even more disorienting. I hope you hang in there :) I’ll be praying for rain.</p>

        <p>It has started clearing, a little, in SoCal.  Hopefully that means things up north are starting to cool down?</p>

        <p>The smoke is unbearable. It’s as bad as ever. But temps have dropped and the smell is gone. The fires are better (yay!). The air is not.</p>
<p>But Friday it’s supposed to rain. Glad you’re seeing some relief.</p>

        <p>Thats how I felt all summer when it was 110 degrees outside. Too hot to do anything outside. Any inside activity is banned or unbearable from the masks.</p>

        <p>I feel you.  This is actually <em>worse</em> than when we had "shelter-in-place" going on, because we can't even exercise outdoors.  The one thing I'm grateful for is that the fires will probably be out by the end of the month, and then things will go back to "tolerable" for me.  For many, though, cold weather is coming that prevents them from going outdoors for many months.  I really feel for them.  How will people get through a winter like this?</p>

        <p>I just want to say even though I’m on the east coast I feel exactly the same way because even going outside is awful because every two seconds I have to see the damn masks and I get angry all over again.  I also miss my outlets, going to a movie, a coffee shop, the gym, just wandering around in shops. All. Unbearable. I mean, it’s not a police state (yet) but I feel like it’s quickly headed that way.</p>
