    <strong>I'm really struggling to maintain positivity</strong>
    <p><p>I dont consider myself left or right (political labels dehumanise us). I just don't understand why so called progressives or 'liberals' who have been campaigning against the wealth gap, pushing the 'my body, my choice' argument and denigrating the media for the last 20 years all of a sudden have become footsoldiers for the agenda who buy everything on Amazon and want to force experimental vaccines on anyone that dares ask any questions. And why people considering themselves conservative or right wing genuinely believe trump or Boris Johnson are anything more than the same old pedo shills.</p>
<p>At first I was hopeful that people are smart enough to pick this bullshit apart, but now I have none. Even my own family members are telling me I can't attend weddings etc if I don't get the vaccine. </p>
<p>Please someone help me out of this hole, I don't like where it ends.</p></p>

        <p>There's no discrepancy: statists on your wealth are statists on your health as well. The underlying problem on all sides is people who do not criticise the state. That includes its intellectuals and contractors.</p>

        <p>I don’t have any answers but I have the same questions. It’s really sad to watch. I thought the people I knew genuinely believed in those things but they are all for crushing small businesses.
 and forcing unwanted things on people.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't know where we go from here. The numbers on subs like this give me a boost but in reality we are peanuts compared to those who are buying the narrative. The same people calling for equality, freedom and non violent solutions are literally calling for anyone who doesn't tow the line to be rounded up and shot.</p>
<p>The thing that bothers me the most is the weakness. People wearing 2 masks layered over each other, the people wearing masks outside, the people going out of their way to harrass and shame complete strangers for not behaving the way they do. How weak and emotionally unstable must these people be to melt down over these things. I don't wear a mask for a medical reason (I have epilepsy and improper breathing induces seizures. I wouldn't wear one anyway) and the amount of busybodies that have went out of their way to high horse me because I'm not obviously visually disabled is staggering. </p>
<p>I'm finding it really difficult to understand how people can take media reports as gospel all of a sudden</p>

<p>This is a marathon, not a sprint. Critics don't need to convince most people to see things our way now. Critics need to maintain a core of independent knowledge (pro- <em>or</em> anti-lockdown: as long as it's capable of critical analysis, it'll do...) until rising costs and discrepancies force them to seek out alternative explanations on their own. We are rising damp, not fire.</p>

        <p>The world has become overly politicized. The reality is none of our problems will be solved by voting or some political party. </p>
<p>The best thing to do is take more control back of your life so that you can distance yourself from the political. </p>
<p>For example, try to move away from the cities, buy some land and start building a more self reliant lifestyle. </p>
<p>It won't happen overnight but in a few years you can be a place where you don't even care what the government does because you are not reliant on them. </p>
<p>Self-reliance preserves liberty.</p>
