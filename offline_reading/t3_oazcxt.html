    <strong>Prof. John Ioaniddis scientific review on the HORRIBLE EFFECTS OF LOCKDOWNS</strong>

<p>As the title says this is a talk recently given by Standford Prof. John Ioaniddis on the negative effects of lockdown and the world's need to stop focusing on the pandemic that affects .1% of the worlds population and begin looking at the 99.9% of the worlds health and other diseases that have been ignored as a consequence of panic.</p>
<p>There are many incredible points in this lecture. </p>
<p>-One of them being the incredible opportunity that we had to completely rid the tobacco industry through extreme covid measures. But this was not even attempted.</p>
<p>-The lack of Randomised Trials for the promotion of preventive health measures (LOCKDOWNS) </p>
<p>-The idea that the are two waves affecting this crisis. One is the covid pandemic and the other wave is the panic that leads to madness and draconian measures without measuring the effects that lockdowns can have in terms of - mental health - losing crucial appointments (cancer screening/operations) - loss of education - loss of social life for people who are not vulnerable to disease - </p>
<p>Basically from what I understand once you turn on the machine ( the funding and preventive measures, the testing) the machine cannot be turned off leading to chaos, panic, fear which as a consequence has driven 500 million people into poverty, 150 million to starvation, and we have no idea what the future effects of these measures will be.</p></p>

        <p>Something as simple as banning cigarette sales, or taxing $2000 per carton would have prevented many people from ending up where they usually do after smoking cigarettes...</p>
<p>In the hospital, on oxygen tanks, in the ICU and on ventilators as they slowly asphyxiate to death due to their own stupidity and bad habits.</p>
<p>Hospitals overwhelmed? Why? Because ICUs were already filled with smokers and other people with perfectly preventable (or able to be diminished) conditions.</p>
<p>We all know while Edna's Bakery was shut down for months so she couldn't make a living, while 'essential services' - bs junk food and cigarette-selling 7-11s, Macs and gas stations were still open selling cigarettes and 'essential' liquor stores were open - because it makes the government money.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 'what a dreamboat' disgusting man Justin Trudeau says "I care about you, I'm with you through all of this, we're doing ALL WE CAN to get back to normal"...</p>

        <p>Dr. IOANIDDIS did another video a while ago where he talked about a study he did near Stanford. The study was done with 3,000~ participants, and the basic premise was he asked folks "have you had covid?" And then he tested them for antibodies that they would only have if they had already caught covid.... 3/10 people SAID they had xovid, 9/10 HAD these antibodies...</p>
