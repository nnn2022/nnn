    <strong>Anybody else doubting their own reason?</strong>
    <p><p>I consider myself a rational person. I trust science, not in the sense that I "believe" in it, but that I know there are some base principles of logic on which everything is built upon. I don't need to study years and years of medicine, chemistry or biology to know that the experts in those fields have little to no chance of being wrong, because of those base principles. I also trust the expertise of those around me and know that without it, society could not function. I trust the engineers who built the place I live in, I trust that lawmakers probably have good reasons for passing what they are passing (in general). We need to do these things because we don't have the time to learn or decide on our own. Yet sometimes I just get this chill, a suspicion, and I don't know if it's good intuitive thinking or I'm being irrational. </p>
<p>I remember when we all thought our phones were listening to our conversations, when it's actually just algorithms and our own biases. If we've googled for a washing machine and fridge, then the algorithm says I'll probably be interested in an AC unit, it's not listening on me talking about getting an AC.</p>
<p>I also am from a former communist country (though I was born after it was abolished), so I know that it's possible for a majority to just be silent to abuse. I have read old school manuals containing propaganda. I get dystopic vibes from everything around me now. </p>
<p>For a few days I've just stopped and doubted my own sanity. I really don't want to see myself turn into some conspiracist, an anti-vaxxer or even a useful idiot. I don't know what's real anymore, I don't know what's a real threat and what is just my own anxiety. On one hand, so many experts swear the vaccine is safe and I know that all medicine has side effects and people have medical allergies anyway (me included). On the other hand, I can't even wrap my mind around the sums of money going into producing them, the masks, the disinfectants and all of those. Then there's the social media censorship, the people wanting Parler down, the others saying it's owned by dubious russians, others saying the US election was stolen. There's the history of medicine, of hundreds of years of people not knowing about bacteria or viruses; administering cocaine or heroin as medicine. I feel like I'm a protagonist in my own mind of some movie like A Beautiful Mind, trying to make sense of it all. </p>
<p>You?</p></p>

        <p>Every time I doubt my position yet another news story comes out from the Doomer Media which just confirms my original position.</p>
<p>In fact, I think the only direction we're "wrong", is we aren't being cynical enough.</p>
<p>Vaccine Passports will be a thing.  They won't call it that, but it will be that.  </p>
<p>They will offer benefits and advantages to everyone who complies, restrictions for those who don't.  </p>
<p>There will be more adverse reactions to this vaccine, but they will continue to stubbornly deny it. </p>
<p>Everyone who supported Trump or questioned the lockdowns will continue being pushed to the fringes of society despite their empty calls for "unity".  </p>
<p>For them "unity" means "everyone agrees with us, and if they don't they should be 're-educated'."</p>
<p>We're dealing with dishonest people here.</p>

<p>Speaking of doomer media, somebody smugglingly linked me a news article saying that 30% of covid patients who were hospitalised had returned later with internal issues, while the covid patients who were not hospitalised didn't. The  official conclusion was that those who had "severe" covid had developed internal problems from it. Like .... no? The common element in here is the hospital? Perhaps they got another infection or they were weak to begin with?? How could this pass off as science? </p>
<p>At least I'm happy that commenters call out bullshit in /r/science</p>

        <p>Look up "iatrogenic disease".</p>
<p>This means death due to medical error.</p>
<p>A John Hopkins Study in 2017 claims 250,000 people die in the United States due to medical error.  Other reports claim it is more like 440,000, a <em>year</em>.  </p>
<p>That's more than covid for everyone keeping score at home.</p>
<p>It is the third leading cause of death in the United States.  But you never hear of it.</p>
<p>The US are drugging their citizens with pharmaceutical medication.  This weakens their immune system, and they develop chronic illness like obesity, diabetes, heart disease.</p>
<p>Then they go to the hospital, but instead of fixing the underlying issues, they go for a quick fix (more pharmaceutical medication, or surgery).</p>
<p>Then these people die.</p>
<p>On paper, this will show up as death by X/Y/Z, but really it's just poor overall health due to lifestyle choices, poor health education, and bad medical advice which focuses on symptoms rather than underlying issues.</p>
<p>Why are so many people dying of a minor respiratory illness like covid?  See above.</p>
<p>Here's the source for the stats above.  It is a very interesting read.  </p>

        <p>I periodically question whether the conclusions I have reached are correct, are sensible, are backed by data.  It's exactly what one should do.  It's VERY easy to be swayed by loud voices, persuasive voices, communal inertia, confirmation bias, observation bias, and a thousand other things.  Our brains are amazing, and do amazing things, but science and rational objective thought are not what they're built for, and it requires constant vigilance to even approach objectivity.</p>
<p>I do still believe that covid would be a nonissue for the world, a flu season at best, if the coverage and insane testing/reporting criteria weren't in place.</p>
<p>Whether this constitutes malicious actors undermining science and controlling the narrative or just a lot of scared idiots is still unclear.  To think of the sheer control and influence it would take to persuade/bribe/coerce enough world/state leaders to buy in is terrifying, and if that's what we're up against we might as well cash out now.  Knowing that a VERY similar agenda got some, but not enough momentum in ~2010 with swine flu makes it feel more planned than accidental, but we simply don't have any way to know.  Conspiracy theories all sound like conspiracy, believing our elected officials to be THAT incompetent or plainly corrupt still seems like a stretch.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I'm not inclined to believe this is actually an attempt at a great reset, forced communism, or anything else.  This is mass public support from people in wealthy western countries that have never known real hardship, never had to overcome actual adversity, invent hardships to show how hard it's all been (reminiscent of: "How I Survived an Hour With a Sprained Finger") suddenly find something even slightly scary and lose their damn minds over it.  The wealthier and more detached from actual hardship, the more terrified they are (conversely, the people who do physical work, construction, don't know where their next month's rent is coming from are the least worried here).   </p>
<p>Get these screaming banshees verbally attacking everyone online or in person and more mature folk that don't want to fight, just live their lives, and you suddenly have a mob that silences even expert dissent.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think about this all the time, mostly trying to figure out how it impacts myself, my family, my job, and what I should be doing to protect those things.</p>

<p>I personally think it's just herd mentality and people pleasing. That country locked down? Okay, we'll do it too. The people are upset that things aren't enforced? Alright, let's enforce the shit out of the rules. </p>
<p>I just get this feeling that if nobody locked down or imposed masks or anything, the media would have done the complete opposite of what it is doing now. They'd say that governments aren't responsable, that covid is deadlier than we think, and I think that I would probably have believed that! </p>

        <p>What is common about all of our anxieties is that they are being caused by people controlling our lives. Most of this you can blame on government, which acted disgracefully this last year. But, another part we have to blame on ourselves. Those outside of government exerting control over us right now are private corporations. Corporations that we have allowed ourselves to become dependent on. Those who are awake to what is going on need to develop themselves as individuals and become self-sufficient, lest we become cattle.</p>

        <p>I've been I doubt about my reason for a long time. Mainly because there have been so many things I believed that turned out to be utter bullshit, then the beliefs I replaced them with also turned out to be bullshit. And during my undergrad I wrote a lot of papers arguing positions I totally didn't agree with, leaving me with the impression that both sides can be argued just as well, with loads of evidence backing them both. Frankly the only thing I see as undoubtedly true is math (why I got into engineering actually). Everything else I just go with my gut, but keep an open mind.</p>
<p>However, looking at what's going on now, it's so obvious there's major fuckery afoot. Whether the numbers are accurate or not, whether our governments are acting out of benevolence or malevolence, our lives and societies are being destroyed, and our rights and freedoms are being erased.  There is no arguing with that, and I have no doubts that it is the right thing to do to resist it.</p>

        <p>I think you can be both a person who believes in science and a person who is skeptical. Im a doctor and have received both of my COVID vaccines. I also think lockdowns are harmful to many facets of society and I dont see a reason to need to wear a mask everytime I set foot outside my house. A big problem is that life is too polarized nowadays.</p>

        <p>Keep questioning and looking for answers. Youre being pumped full of propaganda and they want us to feel uncertain and crazy...so we can turn to them for answers.</p>
<p>Science itself isn't bad, they aren't giving us the science. Vaccines are amazing, when they aren't rushed and forced (which is coming).</p>
<p>Not believing the narrative just because they say to believe them doesn't make you an idiot, human beings are allowed to <em>think</em> and to question and to form their own opinions (such as bodily autonomy and <em>not</em> getting a vaccine or <em>not</em> being afraid EVEN IF THE VIRUS IS SO DEADLY WE SHOULD ALL BE TERRIFIED) and so on. </p>
<p>You aren't crazy.</p>

        <p>You know that an auto mechanic has more knowledge of cars than you, yet you still, have suspicions of the mechanic trying to take advantage of you for profit. Science in its purest form is unbiased search for truth. Humans, though, are not pure. It’s really a simple concept.</p>
