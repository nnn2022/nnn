    <strong>Brave new world, I finally see! The jump in safety issues in VAERS are real! Here's why they're a good thing.</strong>
    <p><p>The vaccines unsafe means they're working! Get more jabs! The unvaxxed that are CAUSING the vaxxed to get sick by getting sick and spreading the disease to the people that were vaccinated against the disease.</p>
<p>We should monitor all people that are getting the vaccine, and if anyone doesn't get side effects, they should be considered unvaxxed until they get enough jabs to get side effects.</p>
<p>Also, FYI, the vaxxed that did get side effects months ago are becoming unvaxxed by the minute by not getting extra jabs.</p>
<p>The worst people, though, are people taking ivermectin prophylactically because it obviously doesn't work, since it shows small benefit in a few studies when used as late treatment, the prophylaxis studies are way too positive, and it's a horse dewormer! Their right should be taken away more swiftly and severely than everyone else's.</p>
