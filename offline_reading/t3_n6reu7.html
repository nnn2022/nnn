    <strong>rant // how can some people be so dummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmb?</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry. This really is a bit of a rant.</p>
<p>I don't know if it is just some people are really stooopid, just really lazzzy, or what... I know this is some really powerful mind control - and I admit the (sick/evil) ppl that thought out this plan, even though it is quite sick/horrifying/etc/etc, actually did quite a clever job with the plan. Just the way they've managed to manipulate a lot of human pysche's, get them petrified and obedient and believing what they see/hear on t.v./radio without using their brain, and then "pit" two classes against each other, and using name calling/labelling while they are at it... (i.e., labeling someone who actually likes breathing as "OMFG! ANTIMAKSER!")... or someone who knows about this thing called an 'immune system' as 'OMFG! ANITVAXXER!'.... or what...</p>
<p>and I "know" the message of "fear" has been used to literally (mentally) beat some people into brainwashed submission so they just don't use their brain...</p>
<p>but sometimes you are just like WHATTTTT-tha_FFFFFFFFF___...</p>
<p>Like. Here is close to a REAL conversation:</p>
<p><strong>REAL sample discussion between someone with a brain and *some* nurses AND "doctors", and then of course armchair joes, or some "smart" people.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>regular person using brain:</em></strong> hi, masks are bad because you can't breathe, you suffocate, they don't do jacksh_t against an imaginary virus to usher in communismas you live in fear, you get bacterial infections, you breathe in deadly particles like graphene/cnts, nanoparticles too for mind control/transhumanism, etc. The injections are bad because of ppl dying, ppl suffering lifelong illnesses, part of a goal to killppl, etc, etc. <em>[&amp; tons and tons of official proof provided, bmj, nejm, un, fdc, cdc, including "official" sources that essentially write articles saying "haha, oops, our bad, we screwed up by 94% becoz we just LOVE that #6! but hehe, just ignore this article, 'member the 6 feet away, 6 foot testing stick, and repeated #6 mantra!"]</em></p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/"doctors", or armchair joes:</em></strong> la la la la la la la la la i can't hear you la la la la la la la la what did you say?</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain</em></strong><em>:</em> what?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/"doctors", or armchair joes:</em></strong> OMFG! conspiracy theorist! tinfoil hat wearer! OMFG OMFG OMFG! EEK!</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> huh? what specifically do you disagree with?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors", or armchair joes:</em></strong> i'm a NURSE/DOCTOR/ARMCHAIR JOE! so THERE!</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> okay, that's nice - so what specifically do you disagree with?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors/, or armchair joes:</em></strong> la la la la la la la la la i can't hear you la la la la EEEEEEEEEK! EEEEEEEEEEEEk!</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> what are you doing? are you DUMB?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors, or armchair joes:</em></strong> I'm a NURSE/DOCTORS! and i know you can DIEEEEEEEE! DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! you need TWENTY THOUSANDS MASKS ON YOUR FACE! and more needles than a pimped out drug dealer! and this silly thing called money? who needs that? magical RAIN dance makes it RAIN RAIN RAIN money!</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> um, what? huh? why?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors, or armchair joes:</em></strong> cuz king fauci SAID so! and he would not LIEEEEEEE! if you could DIEEEEEE! EEEK! and... t.v. sez so! DONTCHEW WATCH TEH NEWs?!?!?! there are now FIFTEEN BILLION CASES! EEEEEEEEEEEEEK! time to do the magical RAIN MONEY DANCE! OOOH! stimulus check coming! OOH MAGICAL RAIN DANCE WORKING!</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> huh? that doesn't even make sense. there aren't even 15 billion people on earth. and wtf are you talking about your rain dance, don't you realize the more money you print, the poorer you get because the price of things go up?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors, or armchair joes:</em></strong> gasp! EEK! you saying that sprayed particles in the air making it TWO HUNDRED BILLION CASES! WE NEED MORE MASKS WITH SOCKS AND NYLON STOCKINGS ON YOUR HEAD! EEEK! OOOH! MAGICAL RAIN MONEY DANCE MAKING MONEY RAIN RAIN RAIN! EEEEEEEEEK!</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> what? that makes no sense. anyways, getting injected with A CONCOCTION that CREATES THE VIRUS INSIDE of you so you DIE makes you sick is pretty dumb. do you not realize you've been manipulated into BEGGING to get injected, so you can die?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors, or armchair joes:</em></strong> EEK! you said vaxEEEN! you must be an ANITVAXXER! OMFG! omfg, time to stuff mouth with more nylon stockings less magical unicorn particles get out</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> wait a sec... why are you suffocating yourself, are you sick?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors, or armchair joes:</em></strong>  EEEK! no, but im a NURSE/DOCTOR! so i KNOW better!</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> how do you know, what?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors, or armchair joes:</em></strong>  I KNOW! becoz mah doctor told me sew!</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> okay, and who told your doctor?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors, or armchair joes:</em></strong>  his doctor told him, and his doctor's doctor told him, and a long line of doctors and nurses told 'em so! The head doctor was busy managing his mask/vax making company counting his billions, so couldn't come to the phone, but he left a memo saying it 'twas so. so THERE! we KNOW! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK! the VIRUS! its COMING! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEk!</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> wtf are you talking about? did you actually read any documents or use any brain cells?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors, or armchair joes:</em></strong>  EWWWWWW! are youa DOCOTR? what sckool did YOU graduate from? EWWWWWWWWW! im a NURSE/DOCTOR! EEEEEEEEEEEEEK! t.v. said so, don't you watch the CASE COUNTS? OMFG! case counts are now THREE TRILLION! OMFG! THREE TRILLION CASES! OMFG! case counts up AGAIN! EEEEEEEEEEEK! FIVE QUADRILLION CASE COUNTS! they are SKYROCKETING!! EEEEEEEEEEEEK! need fifty thousand more masks on face! EEEEEEEEEEEEK! people are DYINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> what? the ppl 'dying' are those getting injected with a substance that MAKES THE VIRUS INSIDE OF THEM, or suffocating themselves with masks so they can't breathe, are you dumb? I thought you said you were a nurse/doctor?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors, or armchair joes:</em></strong>  EEEEEEEEEEEK! ANTIVAXXER! ANTIMASKER! EEEEEEEEEEEEEK! anti MONEY RAIN DANCE MAKER! EW EW EW! must spin self around like top six times and do magical money rain dance! PHEW! magical money rain is falling again! PHEW! can feel magical money coming!</p>
<p><strong><em>regular person with a brain:</em></strong> okay, do you atually have ANY kind of coherent argument, or are you just going to keep saying "EEK! im a nurse/doctor/armchair joe", and keep spinning yourself around like a top to try and get this 'magical money' you talk about?</p>
<p><strong><em>some nurses/doctors, or armchair joes:</em></strong>  EEEK! you said MAGIC MONEY! don't offend magical money rain dance maker!

        <p>This post is too hard to read. I reached the part where you said masks contain nanoparticles for mind control and that's where you lost me.</p>
