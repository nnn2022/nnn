    <strong>My Friend Told Me Yesterday Her Periods Are 9 Days On 9 Days Off 9 Days On Again Since She Took The Experimental mRNA Shots And I'm Feeling Sad For Her</strong>
    <p><p>I tried to talk a friend of mine into waiting to get the clot shots because "I want to travel and my job might require it some time down the line". I gave her facts and resources, which seemed to have an effect, and told her I care about her health and I hoped she would be safe and wait a while. She agreed to think about it. The very day after that conversation she got the shot.</p>
<p>So yesterday she told me she's been having 9 day periods every 9 days ever since she got the shot. Never had them before, always had a regular cycle.</p>
<p>Now she has 9 days bleeding, 9 days not, 9 days bleeding again. She prefaced it with "You're going to say 'I told you so'', then told me of her abnormal periods.</p>
<p>I didn't want to say "I told you so", frankly I wanted to cry. I just told her how sorry I am to hear that, and told her she's not alone. That hundreds of thousands of women have been censored off of fakebook, twitter, reddit etc. who have been experiencing the same thing- menstrual irregularities that never happened until they were injected with whatever that stuff is. It really helped her to realize she's not alone- and I'm angry that she had to go for so many weeks feeling like she was the only one.</p>
<p>All I could say besides validating that she's not alone was "I'm so sorry you're going through that." She said, "Oh that's OK, I just try not to think about it." Which I suppose is her way of trying to protect herself from her terror about what she consented to without really thinking it through. She changed the subject and I let it stay changed because I learned a long time ago that sometimes people need a certain level of denial when they are facing very scary things, and I think it's not really my place to push her into talking about something that scary when she can not undo what has been done to her.</p>
<p>I just keep feeling so sad about it. It's the opposite feeling of the smugness I'm seeing from those who want to put us down for being skeptical. I want to lift her up and I just can't, besides being there for her and being her friend. I'm just so sad about it and I needed to vent. If you're coping with similar feelings please share.</p></p>

        <p>Oh my god, no!!!!! Exactly what B_Garibaldi said, something is not ok. Additionally, if she doesn't have an OBGYN, now would be a good time to call around and try to possibly get in with one. They'll most likely be booked up for a while but it's something to get moving on. </p>
<p>I would also suggest she start religiously taking notes, when it started, color, etc. to give her provider when she's able to see one.</p>

        <p>She has an OB/GYN, and agreed to make an appointment asap. Not sure if she'll do it though given her track record of telling me she'd think over the shot then not following through. I talk with her pretty regularly so I will be asking about her appointment.</p>
<p>That's a good suggestion about the notes! I'll pass it on to her. Thank you.</p>

        <p>This big of a change in her cycle is worth going in for asap. 
Our cycles are a way of our body letting us know when something is off and 9 days on 9 off is a long way off a "normal" cycle.   ESPECIALLY because it has changed from what was previously normal for her. </p>
<p>It may not even be from the vax but it could still be something and what if god forbid its cancer. Time may be of the essence. </p>
<p>I hope everything turns out okay.</p>

        <p>Thank you! I hope it turns out okay too. I agree the menstrual cycle is a good measure of whether things are humming along nicely or whether they're off. That's why I'm so alarmed about hearing this. I truly hope she goes in and gets an evaluation soon.</p>

        <p>I’ve heard so many of these stories first hand now. My post menopausal MIL had heavy irregular bleeding after her jab but wouldn’t admit it was because of that. </p>
<p>I also saw a doctor on Instagram claiming that all sorts of things can affect your period, like illness, stress etc, and I got really annoyed that medical professionals are normalising things that are very serious and very scary for women, because it means they might not get it checked. You should definitely tell your friend to phone her doctor/gyno because that could lead definitely lead to anaemia and also be a sign of something more serious.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean about that instadoctor, the gaslighting is incredible about this. Sorry your postmenopausal MIL had heavy bleeding! And denial.</p>
<p>I definitely asked her to go in to get checked, even though I'm sad to ask her to go back to the very profession that likely harmed her. I'm hoping it's something they can treat or at least they can help prevent anemia.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty solidly against this vaccine for anyone under 65. And certainly against the mandates. And it's a huge freaking deal they haven't done fertility studies on this, and really no child bearing aged woman should do this for that reason. </p>
<p>BUT: lots of things cause ladies' periods to go crazy. And they can return to normal with fertility unaffected. So don't give up hope for your friend. She may be okay. Definitely be there for her, though, she's lucky to have you.</p>

        <p>Thank you! I feel solidly against this injection for anyone until we have several more years' worth of safety data, but definitely for women in their childbearing years. I'm hoping too that it's something other than the injection that has caused her cycle to change. Thanks for saying she's lucky to have me- I feel like there's so little I can actually do, and it's nice to hear you say that.</p>

        <p>Ikr? Ovulation is monthly, not weekly! She told me last year she didn't really want kids. If she changes her mind and if this has actually compromised her fertility, there are many wonderful kids in the world who need foster homes or adoption.  I'm personally just going to not bring up the kid issue right now with her; going to wait and see what her OB/GYN says.</p>

        <p>I feel ya. Two of my friends lost their babies a few days apart less than a week after they got the shot together. Neither acknowledged it was the shot that did it of course, and I don't want to be the asshole that points that out but its a pretty weird coincidence if you ask me. I sent them so much literature and suggested they wait but they were confident. One was almost in her third trimester too. I feel awful for them and their families.</p>

        <p>One of the doctors that treated me was really transparent and caring.
He didn’t doubt for a minute that the vaccine caused all my issues.
He said I’m not the only one suffering with the same issues. He said he’s mainly seen it in young males so far.
Originally when i got my blood clot they took a blood sample as well treating it with anticoagulant.
When the doctor had a private minute with me he basically said that the so call spiked proteins that formed around my blood plates got stuck on each other.
Basically meaning the spike proteins spikes are literally causing them to get stuck on one another.
This doctor I had treat me said he’s fed up with the lies and it deeply concerned.
He almost mentioned that on my chart they aren’t even allowed to mention it’s possibly linked to the vaccine because he could risk his job.
So far he’s said that all these hospitals are being censored and the patience charts are actually being sent off to signed off on by someone higher up so the data can be manipulated and skewed.</p>
<p>As for my Mrs we are still unsure. More tests at the hospital today.</p>

But it starting to seem it’s increasingly common for women to be having issues with their lady bits.
I havent had any issues with my male organs per say but I did suffer a blood clot in my leg and myocarditis from my vaccine.</p>

        <p>I understand how you feel. One of my very best friends (despite me encouraging her to just wait for more data) did the exact same thing. </p>
<p>She thought I was going to be mad at her so she didn’t tell me for a couple weeks. That is what made me feel terrible. </p>
<p>I told her exactly how I feel -  that I would never be mad at her for making a decision she was comfortable with about her own health. That I will always support her decisions and I hope she will do the same for me. And that I hope we are in agreement that no one should be ever be forced or bullied into a vaccination or medical procedure by the government or their employer. So we agreed on that point which I appreciate. </p>
<p>She hasn’t had any side effects that I know of, but I also haven’t asked. </p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with everything you stated. You did the right thing and are a good friend ♥️ You were there for her in a positive way and I don’t think you could have handled it any better. 
I hope your friend is ok and it’s not anything serious.</p>

        <p>Thank you, your comment said things I needed to hear and didn't even know I needed to hear. Much appreciated. And sorry you too have had a friend hide information from you. In my friend's case it has nothing to do with me and everything to do with her fear of anger in general. I am guessing from the kindness of your comment that your friend's reluctance to tell you had nothing to do with you either. I'm happy to hear she has a friend as good as you, and I hope she's OK too. Thanks again for your words, they mean a lot to me.</p>

        <p>I agree completely, part of the psyop is to try to divide us and I'm not having any of it. I keep focusing on the love and trying to stay there instead of letting some psychopaths' bullying cause me to judge or hate the people I care about. Even when it's hard and weird to stay in relationship with the people I care most about, I'm trying not to let all this garbage come between us. Some lesser friendships have fallen away, to be honest, but that's inevitable I think when we go through changes like we have these past 17 months.</p>
<p>You and your friend coming to an agreement about how bullying is wrong makes me happy, and I'm glad you and she have been able to stay close through this storm.</p>

        <p>please encourage her to tell her story and be an activist against this vaccine. The more voices there are, the harder they will be to censor until they cannot ignore the evidence anymore.  Expressing issues in private is only the start.  She needs to go public, call up local newspapers or stations.  she has to try.</p>

        <p>We have had a stories of women sharing their irregular menstrual cycle stories. There have been posts of women having weird stuff coming out.</p>
<p>I am stupid when it comes to female anatomy, and I'm no doctor, but if I am not mistaken, huge red clumps are not part of the monthly regimen unless the menstrual cycle has been compromised by a third party (re: inoculation) vector, disease or genetic predesposition.</p>
<p>Regarding your friend, I hate to say it, but you should have said, "I told you so!" And in addition, you should not feel sad. I say this because they knew what they were getting into. She knew there would be problems. Why? Because you forewarned her, but she went and took the inoculation any ways!</p>
<p>This is akin to telling a person, please do not put your hand on the hot stove. If you put your hand on the stove, you're going to get burned and your skin is going to probably going to get infected and it is going to hurt for a while. However, that person doesn't listen to you, they do it any way and their hand gets burned badly. They start crying, bitching and moaning how their hand hurts, scarred and now infected but the only thing you can say is, "I told you so!"</p>

        <p>I feel sad, but I don't feel like saying "I told you so" because she's already afraid and hurting. I see no point in heaping self-righteous hurtful words on top of what she's already going through.</p>
<p>I understand your perspective about the hot stove and I think you were trying to help me not feel bad, so I thank you. </p>
<p>It's just that I think she <em>didn't</em> really know what she was getting into- no one from the media, the political sphere, the medical establishment, or big pharma is warning people about this very common effect of the shots. And I don't feel any regret or guilt or anything, because I know I did what I could to warn her of what I could, including toning it down to "please wait until we have more data" instead of screaming NOOOO at her like I felt like doing :)</p>

        <p>red clumps can be part of it.</p>
<p>but sudden irregularity is unusual. could be for a lot of reasons! </p>
<p>thing is after your teen hormones settle down, you learn how your body normally reacts. some women stay irregular. most don't. </p>
<p>there are a lot of hormones involved in menstruation, and a lot of regular fluctuations to keep it all working as it ought to.</p>
<p>for example some hormonal level changes signal the body to begin building up uterine lining, others to begin preparing an ovum for potential fertilization, and still other changes that tell the body "no pregnancy, shut er down, discard the uterine lining" (which is menstruation).</p>
<p>so for that process to start up again in post-menopausal women is, in my amateur opinion, alarming.</p>
<p>or for hormone levels to be so affected that a woman is menstruating every 18 days instead of every 28ish.</p>
<p>big changes. should be investigated and not disregarded as "myyyyysterious feeeemales", which is what i worry will happen.</p>

        <p>I agree, I think women's reproductive health is pretty darn important and isn't taken seriously enough by the Rockefeller-corrupted allopathic "hEaLtH" system. I mean, they're just chicks, right? (Obviously being sarcastic on the "just chicks" thing). I'm heartened to see how many commenters here are taking it as seriously as I am, thank you for your comment.</p>

The fact she gets out of bed on a given day is a triumph, and besides actually getting out of bed she functions remarkably well in society. It is not her fault that she's been subjected to nonstop daily propaganda by people whose job it is to try to hide the truth from her, and not her fault that she caved.</p>
