    <strong>Someone who doesn’t agree with your subs overarching ideas</strong>
    <p><p>First of all I really don’t want this to become some trash heap of a comment section, as someone who doesn’t exactly believe what the majority of what this sub believes I just was a civil discussion.</p>
<p>I have struggled through this past year or so of covid as much as any of us have and generally just want to understand where some of you might be coming from. For some context I am a 23 year old male in college who recently received the first dose of a Pfizer vaccine(I know, the horror). </p>
<p>Call me naive or anything you’d like but I trust science and what the doctors have been saying through the most of this shithole. I’ve worn a mask, will continue to wear a mask and just hope for the the best as many of you do too. My problem with this sub is that I feel like so many of you are just going against what someone like me sees as the right thing to do. Wear a mask, social distance, do what I can to hopefully allow myself and other to go back to normal. I’m not a doctor, scientist or anything of the sort so I have no solution to this issue and I’m not sure anyone does!</p>
<p>I’ve been in this subreddit as a lurker for about a month or so now because I like to see what people who might not think like me are thinking. I’ll be honest most of the posts get a chuckle or head shake from me but I don’t look down on anyone for how they might think. The thing is I just don’t get how so many of you feel like the world is out to get you. Don’t get me wrong, I assume everyone is an asshole until proven otherwise but I just don’t get how everything about going back to how things were before can be spun to negatively. </p>
<p>The main thing that got me to post this was a post I’ll link here: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mhb23f/whoa_a_mask_that_works/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</p>
<p>I get the jokes around the vaccine, but a microchip really? We carry our phones with us all the time and that’s more of a microchip than what they could put in us! Sure I don’t necessarily want to be tracked or anything but I’m not doing anything illegal so what do I have to be worried about! I don’t want to carry around an ID to say I was vaccinated or anything but if it means I can do what I want I’m okay with that so so what? </p>
<p>I know I rambled a lot here but I really just want to understand I have a discussion about what our world is now with people who might not see it how I do so call me dumb or whatever I just hope you know I don’t judge you on how you chose to live your life and I hope you don’t judge me on how I live mine but maybe try and help me understand.</p></p>

        <p>When I was 23 years old I was naive.  The government doesn’t give a shit about you.  Nobody cares if you die tomorrow except your family and friends.  The politicians and deep state scientists and doctors are doing what they are doing and saying what they are saying not to save lives but for their own careers.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, this world is about three things: money, power, and control.</p>
<p>I live in NYC.  Soon I won’t be able to go to Madison Square Garden without a vaccine passport saying I got the vaccine.  Why do you think this is?</p>

        <p>Life is the farthest thing from normal right now and if you think it's going to go back to normal without a fight you are not living in reality. They are not going to suddenly say okay everybody take the masks off and go back to normal we're finished with this! This is going down the same road as what happened after 9/11. You still have to take your shoes off in the airport and follow guidelines that were set up 20 years ago as a temporary measure. Are you okay with wearing masks forever because that's where we're headed with this. With being locked down every time someone has a sniffle? Because that's where we're headed with this. With being required to take injections every 6 months for at least the next decade of your life to keep your passport up-to-date? Because that's where we're headed with this. They are now using the term permanent pandemic. This should terrify you. They are expecting us to live as if as if this is a permanent State at this point. This disease has become endemic. There are many endemic diseases that exist. There's no such thing as a permanent pandemic but this is the world they are creating for us now. Think about their words and how they create new terminology to make this stuff acceptable.</p>

        <p>I think you need to lurk around quite a bit longer to understand our mindset here. Only a handful of us even talk about microchips in the vaccine, I for one don’t believe that at all. Let me ask you why you trust the government and the science and doctors that have been preaching to you. Really? How have they proven they are trustworthy? By shutting down and silencing the scientists, leaders, and doctors that disagree with them???</p>

        <p>It’s for sure easier for scientist etc to just push the barrier I’ve or COVID along as opposed to arguing against them it. I don’t think there exactly trustworthy but I trust them because I don’t have a better idea of what’s going on as compared to someone who has dedicated there life to this kind of thing. I tend to believe that at a certain extent they can’t all be lying about it right?</p>

        <p>You're missing the point.  Only some scientists and experts have been allowed to have a voice.  Many scientists, doctors, other experts have been silenced and professionally punished if they present a viewpoint that questions the narrative at all.  A component of science is the ability to debate and test alternative hypotheses.  That isn't happening.  What is being pushed is not science, it's politics and big business disguised as science.  </p>
<p>Point and case: the World Health Organization changed a well established definition of herd immunity in November 2020, right before vaccines were unleashed.  The previous definition acknowledged that it could be achieved both through a certain threshold of the population getting a virus and/or a vaccine.  This definition was changed to exclude natural immunity (immunity acquired from getting the virus), and stated that vaccines are the only way to reach herd immunity.  So now we have a situation where you have misleading information about immunity and the population is led to believe that the only way forward is by taking these vaccines, which are still experimental and <em>authorized for emergency use only</em>, which is a whole different beast than actually being thoroughly tested and FDA <em>approved</em>.  Meanwhile, vaccine makers are being granted immunity from lawsuit if anyone experiences an adverse effect (and many people have, these injuries and deaths are documented in the VAERS database).</p>
<p>But beyond all of that... no one here cares if you choose to get the vaccine or wear a mask.  That's your choice.  What we all want the ability to make decisions for ourselves - assess our own level of risk and act accordingly.  Unfortunately, we are quickly approaching a world where medical autonomy no longer exists; privacy, including and especially medical privacy, is a thing of the past, and big tech/business/government/pharma dictates our lives.  They've already uprooted small business, destroyed cities, destroyed lives, and destroyed the only good elements of healthcare we had going in this country.  Lockdowns will undoubtedly lead to more life years lost than what has been or would have been lost to the virus.</p>

        <p>&rt; no one here cares if you .... wear a mask.</p>
<p>Sorry, gotta disagree here.  There's a reason why masks were prohibited in certain places before.  There's also the issue of mask zealots forcing their beliefs on their children which will likely lead to (even more) psychological trauma.  Also, masks hinder communication and they help turn a society into one in which people are suspicious of each other.  At this point in time I too am almost ready to say "fuck it, wear a mask if you want, just leave me alone", but that's what the easy way out looks like right now, sadly.  I'm standing on firm ground here:  If you are wearing a mask you are either sick and should have stayed home, or you are wearing one due to a reason people wore them before.  We <em>should</em> be returning to the idea that when someone walks into a bank, convenience store etc. with their face covered up it's a cause of alarm.</p>

        <p>“If it means I can do what I want I’m okay with that so so what?”</p>
<p>A woman <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-york-city-waitress-fired-after-not-getting-covid-19-n1258155">lost her job</a> for refusing vaccination because she was trying to get pregnant. To say that “everyone is compatible with this vaccine” is pretty asinine, and mandating it for everyone is just reckless. Should women trying to get pregnant not be able to travel? Should they be forcibly vaccinated? </p>
<p>There are valid reasons for people to wait on the vaccine. I share the concerns of the <a href="https://www.today.com/video/theranos-whistleblower-shares-concerns-over-rush-for-coronavirus-vaccine-89477189872">Theranos whistleblower</a> over the rush to market and lack of longitudinal studies on a new technology; this is not your everyday vaccine, and those of us with pre-existing conditions have right to be concerned with the methodology.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have rights.</p>
<p>As far as what could have been done - we should have actually quarantined at the very beginning of the pandemic. The CDC <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/2/12-0312_article">has learned a lot about the success of quarantines </a>, and the premise of it just makes sense - in order to stop the spread you have to stop it at its source. Historically this means isolating EVERYONE re-entering the country, not just people from certain nations. There are a few nations who have done this with success, such as Tonga (a country with zero COVID cases) but it has had effects on the tourism industry.</p>
<p>As for the masks, everyone talks about physical exposure, but there isn’t enough discussion about the right amount of exposure for herd immunity. Yes, masks limit airflow, but is zero amount of contact with Covid-19 the goal? This is where immunologists seem to disagree.</p>
<p>If you want to wear a mask, that’s your choice. It’s the government mandates that people take issue with.</p>

        <p>Also, the world kind of is out to get some of us.</p>
<p>Many of us have lost our businesses.  Many of us have lost our jobs.  We've lost our dreams, our hopes, our futures.  Our plans have been completely uprooted.  </p>
<p>Think about what your plan is.  Think about that thing you love most in the world.  <strong>Now rip that away.</strong> You can never do that again.  And not because you <em>can't</em>.  Because people like you are preventing us.  You are directly standing in the way of our <em>raison d'être</em>.</p>
<p>You didn't lose everything.  You didn't have things derailed.  How can you stand there and wag your finger at people who have lost everything while you yourself have lost nothing?</p>
<p>The boat is sinking, and you're in a life boat pointing down at all of us drowning in the water to "just stop complaining".  </p>
<p>For the first two months, I was understanding.</p>
<p>Two months after that, I was patient.</p>
<p>Two months after that I watched as everyone suddenly and violently changed their own rules which destroyed our lives, and then went on to justify this in an outrageous display of tremendous hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Two months after that, I wept uncontrollably for about a month straight.</p>
<p>You've taken everything away from hundreds of millions of people, and you <em>still</em> don't understand why people are pissed off??  Seriously??  Have you even thought about it, even once??</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure no one actually thinks that the vaccines contain any kind of chip or tracking technology. I am convinced that was made up to make us look crazy. You are right, our phones already do that. There is a possibility that in the future they will release actually microchip implants with the vaccines passport info on. Look at the chips people have been getting in Sweden over the last few years. It could also easily be linked to Neuralink too.</p>

        <p>Dude the thing is...it's been over a year now. People are sick, tired, broke and losing patience with lockdowns. You have a brain man, you gotta use it don't just ride with the so called "experts". </p>
<p>A vaccine so good for a virus with a 99.9% survival rate will never ever make sense no matter how you slice it. </p>
<p>Just think, the wealthiest 1% could eradicate child poverty in a few days but instead they're more concerned with "covid" infact all we hear and see now is fear and propaganda everywhere on billboards, TV, and the internet.</p>
<p>This virus came out the blue, there's so much conspiracy around it because it literally came out of nowhere so people are sceptical, and desperately trying to intimidate 7.8 billion people to inject themselves with a "new" vaccine sounds like a sick ploy to me, honestly sounds like population control under the carpet.</p>
<p>This whole thing stinks...Wal-Mart is open but Gyms are closed...seriously why punish the gyms for Wal-Mart's sins??? If they open Wal-Mart &amp; Costco then covid-19 will spread anyway! It's an invisible respiratory virus my guy...and even than how many people have to lose jobs, commit suicide, get locked down a whole year in to all this! We're still back at step zero! Even Albert Einstein told us that doing the same damn thing over &amp; over leads is WRONG. </p>
<p>If people like you don't wake up we'll just be having this EXACT discussion next Summer. I swear to god.</p>

<p>Most Germans in the 1930s did not believe in Nazism, but they “tried to abide by the rules and regulations that businesses are setting and getting by to do what i want at the same time”.</p>
<p>We aren’t yet frying “science deniers” and “anti maskers” in ovens but we are demonizing, vilifying, ostracizing them/us.  Just like was done to the Jews.</p>

        <p>I have a few comments that go semi indepth as to why I and many others disagree with mask mandates, and in general believe covid is overblown. </p>
<p>First, some numbers. </p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex">CDC mortality data</a> , people ages 18-29 account for .36% of all covid deaths, and people ages 30-39 account for 1.05% of all covid deaths. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/jpFNp0Y">These percentages were calculated by taking the values highlighted in blue, and dividing by the circled value at the bottom</a>. With this knowledge in mind, I would argue that it makes sense for the government to give its population the choice to decide whether or not a mask is needed for them, whether they should stay at home, or whether they should isolate in an underground bunker wrapped in bubblewrap. Those at risk are welcome to stay at home if they do not want to get vaccinated, or they can receive the vaccine free of charge in every single state in the United States. There's an argument to be made that I ought to take the vaccine for the immunocompromised, to which I would direct you to the CDC's very own ACIP. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/immunocompetence.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>"All inactivated vaccines can be administered safely to persons with altered immunocompetence, whether the vaccine is a killed whole-organism or a recombinant, subunit, split-virus, toxoid, polysaccharide, or polysaccharide protein-conjugate vaccine."</p>
<p>&rt;I get the jokes around the vaccine, but a microchip really? We carry our phones with us all the time and that’s more of a microchip than what they could put in us! Sure I don’t necessarily want to be tracked or anything but I’m not doing anything illegal so what do I have to be worried about! I don’t want to carry around an ID to say I was vaccinated or anything but if it means I can do what I want I’m okay with that so so what?</p>
<p>Because the U.S. government has a history of using it's population as science experiments (tuskegee experiments, smallpox blankets) as well as using emergency authorizations during times of crisis to enact policy detrimental to the population. A good example of this is the patriot act, hastily enacted post 9/11 in a scared, docile America, allowing for decades of illegal surveillance of U.S. citizens in the name of fighting the war on terror. </p>
<p>If there's anything you want clarification on feel free to ask, I could write a whole lot more but for the sake of keeping it brief i'll leave it at that. You appear to be genuinely interested in hearing other peoples' opinions which I appreciate, so I hope I could shed some light on our perspective.</p>

        <p>Not everyone here may be on the same page, but most are at least in the same book. You say you trust the science. The problem with this statement, and the problem most people on this sub can see is that results can be paid for. The two main examples I like to use is coca cola and the science behind sugar, and the tobacco industry with nicotine and the dangers of smoking. 
The contradiction with the science behind covid is that independent doctors and scientists that were bringing their professional opinions and knowledge from the field to the table were being censored because it didn't follow whatever the MSM agenda was. All while the MSM and government officials were telling us to trust doctors and scientists, but only the ones they deemed acceptable. </p>
<p>There is also a problem with civil liberties. The US is a country founded in individual freedom and liberty. Instead of telling people of age and/or with preexisting conditions that they may have to take certain measures (distancing and masks) to help prevent them from catching this virus. The government instead decided it was ok to limit everyone's free will and movement. Which goes against some of our basic freedoms. The constitution does not take a sick day. And it is unacceptable to use a virus not only to limit liberties but to extend the powers of the government. </p>
<p>What you are seeing on this sub is people that see a dangerous door being opened that could very possibly lead to an even greater police state run by an even more tyrannical government then we already have. </p>
<p>Any mindless obedience without question is only ushering in the downfall of liberty and free will. </p>
<p>All I ask is for you as a young individual. Is to ask as many questions as you can. Come to your own conclusions using a little research and critical thinking. Don't be blindly obedient</p>

        <p>I tend to ramble so I will keep it fairly short. There is a lot I could say but the vaccine passport they are trying to implement is nothing short of medical apartheid. It is creating a caste system, a two tiered society. The vaccinated and the unvaccinated. There are many people who I have chosen not to or cannot take this vaccine for various reasons. Do you think it's fair to exclude them from society? To make them second-class citizens? Because that's exactly what's happening in Israel right now. I am in New York and it's beginning to happen here. I can no longer go to a concert or sporting event. Do you think that's fair? What did I do to deserve this? I didn't comply with what the government wants me to do, I refused medical procedure.</p>
<p>I think you need need to really try and think of the big picture. This is about far more than a virus and vaccine. If you think it's going to stop with this you're being very short-sighted. It will snow ball with other things being added to this platform. This is setting us up for complete control, your government will be able to opt you in and out of society if you aren't complying or behaving as they want you to. It's not just about being vaccinated and wearing masks etc. It seemed like that in the beginning but a year in now it's obvious it's about much more. A few years ago I would have said exactly what you're saying, I'm not doing anything wrong, I'm not doing anything illegal I have nothing to fear. Well guess what? We are at a point now where something you did three years ago can become illegal and they can go back to that time and punish you for it. Look at the way people are being canceled for things they said 10 years ago on Twitter. They're losing their jobs, losing their livelihoods. People are even losing their jobs if they stand up for someone else, we are at a point where it's guilt by association. You need to look at the total picture here.</p>
<p>Damn I just can't keep it short with this lol</p>

        <p>I believe Covid is quite bad (especially now, as variants are causing records for cases, hospitalizations and deaths in late March of year 2, with the “dark winter” behind us) and that wearing masks in enclosed public places and getting vaccinated clearly help the situation, but lockdowns are harmful as hell and shift all the responsibility for the pandemic to innocent citizens worldwide. All of the harmful aspects of lockdowns are real, and nearly as bad as the virus itself. </p>
<p>I try to take a middle way with all this, particularly as I’ve come to believe that Covid is a gain of function experiment leaked by accident from a lab in Wuhan. I bet there’s quite a lot of crossover between those who are fighting the “new normal” concept and those who buy into the lab-leak theory actually, somehow.</p>

        <p>I don’t know about that microchip nonsense, but my issue is twofold:</p>
<p>1.) We’re on day, what, 382? Of 15 days to slow the spread? </p>
<p>2). Mask mandates and lockdowns <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/us-coronavirus-deaths-by-state-july-1.html">don’t</a> <a href="https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/info-2020/states-mask-mandates-coronavirus.html">work</a>. Period. No matter what you do: mandate, lockdown, or stay open, it doesn’t matter at all where you end up on that list. </p>
<p>Wear a mask if you want, stay home if you’re at a higher risk. But don’t tell me that I have to as well.</p>

        <p>More reasonable line of thought for you to ponder : the virus is real but is being overblown to push a globalist agenda. It's about power and money (always have been), once you have a fully compliant society, your power over it is total. </p>
<p>A bit more food for thought : the feeling you get from power and gaining more power is comparable to drugs and shares the same mechanisms. A lot of people make the wrong assumption that people ruling us are reasonable people.</p>

        <p>All the so called 'science', 'all the experts', and 'all the studies' can't deny the following undisputed facts:</p>
<p>The pore size of fabric masks is 200 microns.</p>
<p>Droplets over 100 microns fall to the ground in seconds.</p>
<p>The pores in the lungs filter down to 2-10 microns.</p>
<p>The contagious viral droplets are 1-5 microns in size, the majority of them will easily go through the fabric masks.</p>
<p>While mask usage went up over 75%(probably more like 95%), the number of covid cases exploded.</p>
<p>If you are able to verify these facts, then the next step is to think logically.   If you do, then you can conclude that the mask is blocking droplets that would fall to the floor in seconds.  These large droplets fall by gravity and it would be virtually impossible for them to travel the way air does, and make it to someone else's lungs.</p>
<p>The mask with 200 micron pores is completely ineffective at blocking the less than 10 micron contagious particles that float in the air for hours.  T</p>
<p>The mask is breeding pathogens and collecting filth for you to inhale over and over again.</p>
<p>The mask is dehumanizing and creating a climate of fear.</p>

        <p>So you are okay with living in a two-tiered society? You are okay with people don't that do not want to be injected with an experimental vaccine being excluded from society? What about pregnant women? Do you think they should be excluded from society if they don't take a vaccine while pregnant? If you really think this is okay you are going to have a very rude awakening one day.</p>
