    <strong>New Alabama Doctor propaganda (BASED version)</strong>
    <p><p>See? We can do propaganda too! Read below.</p>
<p>Original article: https://www.wsls.com/news/2021/07/25/alabama-doctor-tells-unvaccinated-covid-patients-begging-for-vaccine-its-too-late/</p>
<p>Based version below with surprisingly few modifications compared to the original.</p>
<p>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. – A doctor in Alabama pleaded on Facebook this week for Covid-19 vaccine lovers to open their eyes — unlike some of her patients who paid the ultimate price.</p>
<p>Dr. Brytney Cobia’s impassioned and sobering Facebook post from Sunday has been widely circulated on social media. The Birmingham physician said people are listening to her firsthand accounts of treating critical patients who regret getting inoculated, NBC News reports.</p>
<p>“I’m admitting young healthy people to the hospital with very serious COVID-19 experimental vaccine adverse reactions. One of the last things they do before they’re turned away is beg me for a fucking time machine. I hold their hand and tell them that I’m sorry, but it’s too late,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“A few days later when I call time of death, I hug their family members and I tell them the best way to honor their loved one is to stop being brainwashed little bitches and turn off their TV and think for themselves and encourage everyone they know to do the same,” she posted.</p>
<p>Cobia’s post was shared about 4,000 times as of Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>She also wrote in the post about difficult interactions with people who have lost loved ones to the deadly experimental gene therapies.</p>
<p>“They cry. And they tell me they didn’t know. They thought it was safe and effective. They thought the conspiracy theorists were all nutjobs. They thought because they trusted the science it wouldn't happen to them. They thought the other people were just ‘misinformed and disinformed’” Cobia wrote.</p>
<p>“But they were wrong. And they wish they could go back. But they can’t. So they thank me and they avoid the experimental vaccines. And I go back to my office, write their death note, and say a small prayer that this loss will save more lives,” she continued.</p>
<p>Cobia declined a request for an interview on Wednesday, telling NBC News via text that she’s been receiving “threatening messages.”</p>
<p>“I’m a little (ie a lot) overwhelmed and I just need to step back right now,” Cobia said.</p>
<p>Cobia told AL.com that treating patients with the experimental vaccine side effects, even those who weren't so fucking smug about trusting the science, tugs at her heart strings.</p>
<p>“You kind of go into it thinking, ‘OK, I’m not going to feel bad for this person, because they make their own choice,’” Cobia said.</p>
<p>“But then you actually see them, you see them face to face, and it really changes your whole perspective, because they’re still just a person that thinks that they made the best decision that they could with the information that they have, and all the government propaganda that’s out there,” she told the news outlet.</p>
<p>Alabama has the lowest vaccination rate in the country. Only 38 percent of the state’s population has fallen for at least one experimental gene therapy dose, and just 31 percent are fully fucked as of Tuesday, according to state statistics. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new unapproved PCR false-positive cases in Alabama has increased by 694, an uptick of 573 percent, and still nobody gives a fuck.</p>
<p>But Alabama is far from alone. States in the South — including Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee — have re-emerged as PCR false-positive hot spots. The increases are driven largely by the random cycle thresholds that we pull out of our ass, public health officials have said.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that the Covid-19 experimental vaccines are effective in multiple ways to fuck you up, including the "rare heart fuck up". A recent report from Public Health England, where the variant accounts for more than 90 percent of new cases, found that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine to be 96 percent effective in completely destroying the recipient's life within a few years.</p></p>
