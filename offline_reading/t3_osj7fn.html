    <strong>It's like people have forgotten what the rules of life are</strong>
    <p><p>Long time lurker, first time poster.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm happy to have found this sub and to see I'm not alone in my views. I've been frustrated for several months about society. I'm frustrated that the internal alarm bells of most people aren't going off. I'm a very pessimistic person by nature, and I already held views of "most people are sheep", but I never would have thought something like what we're experiencing now is possible.</p>
<p>One common thing I've come to notice, and this may sound pretty philosophical, is that people seemingly have become more disconnected from nature. In the 100.000+ years that humans or human-like lifeforms have existed, there have ALWAYS been viruses. People get sick, yes. They always will. But that is why you have an immune system. And of course, some people will die because their immune system fails to protect them whilst others will survive. People have become so disconnected from nature, it's just insane to see. We need to come into contact with viruses, we need to make our hands dirty from time to time and so forth.</p>
<p>I just don't understand how people think living in a sterile environment and blindly taking pills/vaccines is healthy. I've not been vaccinated for COVID-19 and I'm not planning to either. But I have received vaccines in the past, like for polio. I also had COVID-19 and when I got it, I was happy. I was happy because I knew I was going to be just fine and my body would create antibodies against the virus. But it's insane to see how some people are just... so disconnected from the basic rules of life.</p></p>

        <p>On the removal from nature. It's baffling. </p>
<p>I also had the kung-flu not long ago and the messaging is telling me that doesn't matter one bit and I need a vaccine in order to be let back into society.</p>
<p>There is no logic. There are no studies provided that even hint that vaccine-induced immunity is better or longer lasting than natural immunity. There is no attempt to differentiate who may ACTUALLY need the experimental pseudo-vaccine beyond vague, obfuscating language designed to make everyone think they will die or be permanently disabled by NOT taking it. </p>
<p>The immune system is becoming some kind of fucking folklore and I can't get my head around it. </p>
<p>When I was in school. they did the little pre-test thing for TB inoculation and I was naturally immune - I didn't then get the fucking vaccine anyway to make my classmates feel safer.</p>

        <p>I was surprised too, the first time I heard (long, long before covid came along) some people actually believe natural immunity created by exposure is a barbaric and backwards way of life, they believe we are such advanced creatures our bodies can just depend on drugs to never have to create natural resistance, that exposing ourselves to nature is beneath us at this point in civilization.</p>

        <p>Literally disconnected from nature. I recently discovered earthing/ grounding. Apparently our health depends on out body touching the ground without shoes. Another "scientific Innovation" that has now cost people their health. </p>
<p>For an introduction to earthing/ grounding you can find "The Earthing Movie" documentary on YouTube.</p>

        <p>Thank you! Honestly, earthing needs to catch on really fast right now, because it helps prevent blood clots, which we know is going to be a huge problem with all the vaxxed people. I really think this is something that can help. It might not fix it completely, but it help significantly.</p>

        <p>Whatâ€™s weird this time is that the virus is not natural. It probably came from scientists in the Wuhan lab who took an animal coronavirus and altered it to infect humans (gain of function).</p>

        <p>People have seemed to have forgotten that the very ill and elderly die all the time. That life itself is full of risk and danger. </p>
<p>People are trying to create this bizzare utopia/dystopia that is somehow free of risk, or even the slightest discomfort in which it is somehow a human right to never get sick or die, or offended.</p>

        <p>I've lived in a rural location all of my life, I loved playing in the mud, ate worms (lol), didn't always wear appropriate clothing in the winter, never bothered to stay out of the rain and I've never had a bad illness.</p>
<p>My wife's family are city people and her sisters children are always ill with something or other. The bad air and a lack of exposure to nature and dirty shit have put them at a real disadvantage imo.</p>
<p>Btw. Welcome to the sub; if you're a member of r/pics, r/aww, r/offmychest or a few others, expect your ban messages any time now lmao.</p>
