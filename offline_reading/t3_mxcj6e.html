    <strong>Anyone recall how scary MSM made covid look in the earliest stages?</strong>
    <p><p>This was after China had announced covid was spreading there and all of that. Soon after (around March 2020) my family had begun to quarantine because we were genuinely scared. MSM would show videos and articles of Chinese citizens passing out in the middle of the street or screaming in the hospital in the early stages. We didn't think at first it would get to the US, but it did eventually, thats when we got super scared.  My step dad was the only one in my family who went to work because he couldn't afford to loose his job. Yet, during his time there someone got sick from covid, but no one else got it. This is a big deal because MSM said it spread very rapidly throughout the air. This lady was working at his job and she was pretty sick, but she couldn't afford to not be working. The company would not grant paid leave unless that person tested positive for covid and tests were not widely available yet. (This woman did get tested soon after and was positive) No one wore masks on a large scale (at least here at the time) and the workers in that area have to be close together since they work on a production line. So this lady later tests positive and she is showing symptoms, and guess what? the 10 other people who stood next to her with no protection who breathed in the same air particles as her for 12 hours never got sick. Yes, I suppose the argument could have been they were all asymptomatic, but it proved to us that it wasn't as deadly and horrible as the media has showed to us. After that, my family was no longer living in fear. As time progressed, people weren't dying in the middle of the street due to covid, and people weren't screaming in agony because they had it.</p>
<p>I think the start of the pandemic often gets swept under the rug, but I think it just proves that MSM was initially instilling fear into our heads from the very beginning. Maybe people forgot about since there's just so much corruption in every aspect and there's so much to talk about. I honestly think that someone intentionally "made" this virus, but it didn't turn out to be as deadly as they intended it to be. That's why MSM was telling us to be terrified of it, but it ended up not being deadly. My opinion of the origin of covid dives more into the "conspiracy theory" though, I'll admit. I still think it's important to at least take into consideration, because if it happens to be true, then we need to find who's responsible and they need to be held accountable.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PS: No, I'm not implying that Chinese or Asian people are to blame for this. There are innocent people in China that had nothing to do with covid's origins and they suffered from the very beginning of it all. I can't tell you who is to blame for it, and humanity might never find out. It's very sad, the reality of it all. I can't give all the answers, nor can I give much "evidence", but I know deep down that there is something not right about it.</p>
<p>Edit: I apologize about when I said we "quarantined", we did for the most part, besides when we needed food, but we were really over paranoid and even sanitized all of our groceries. My step dad did work (he didn't work in the same production line as the lady I mention that got covid, he does more of a desk job for the company) but he did everything he could to stay away from people. Later for us to find out it was all unnecessary!!</p></p>

        <p>I know!! Everyone still treats it as if it’s the most dangerous thing on earth. People aren’t dropping dead in the middle of the street. I think part of the reason it was so bad in China was because they’re government has absolute control over the media so basically they can put any idea into they’re heads that they want. It’s all very sad.</p>

        <p>Oh I was full doomer at the beginning. No one really knew much about the virus, and people were dropping like flies...Italy, New York, “leaked videos” of doctors in China crying at the overload of patients. For the first few weeks we stopped visiting family. I’d get extremely angry with friends/family who kept doubting the severity of the virus and criticizing masks and quarantine. FWIW, I never supported government mandates, but I was disappointed that my community couldn’t voluntarily unify over what was supposed to be a temporary, relatively inconvenient effort to slow the spread until the virus was understood and perhaps a cure was found (Also, remember when it was always <em>slow</em> the spread, not <em>stop</em> it?) </p>
<p>Over time, my patience with the lockdowns was gradually weakening, and after a few months when we identified the vulnerable population and even some promising cures, I lost interest in keeping up the charade completely. By then I’d known multiple friends/family who tested positive, and others with all the classic symptoms who tested negative. Everyone said it was a bad cold and they all got over it within 2 weeks. I knew a man in his 80’s who was on dialysis in the hospital who tested positive...he’s still truckin along to this day, as healthy as a horse now. </p>
<p>I’ve been doing a lot of reading on Vit D, how there’s “No cold/flu season, just low Vit D season”....COVID hit at the tail end of low Vit D season, when everyone’s D levels were probably at their lowest. Perhaps that could explain a lot of the mass deaths around that time. Now that more people are aware of getting sick and probably paying more attention to supplementing their immune system, we’re not seeing the same numbers we saw a year ago. I also suspect that COVID has naturally weakened itself by now. We’re definitely out of the woods now, we know who’s at risk and how they can protect <em>themselves</em>, and things are only getting better. I’m 100% over COVID regulations.</p>

        <p>"No cold/flu season, just low vitamin d season"</p>
<p>Dr Ryan Cole? I watched some of his videos along with Dr Pierre Kory, looked into these dudes backgrounds, political affiliations and you know what? I've found no reason for these dudes to be dishonest or biased about anything they've been saying. Ever since I watched Dr Coles videos I've started supplementing VD3 along with zinc and Magnesium and honestly I've been feeling overall better, I've been doing it for about 2 months and I no longer feel the need for a mid day nap and I wake up feeling much more rested. </p>
<p>Dr Cole is spot on when he emphasizes how most people are immunosuppresed. That's what's really killing people, (the extremely low only died from covid deaths) weak ass immune systems.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t sure what his name was, but that seems right. He wasn’t the first doctor I heard talk about how important Vit D is, but that “low Vit D season” thing stuck with me. When I watched Dr. Cole’s lecture, I didn’t doubt a single figure he was presenting because I personally know me and all my family have had the lab tests confirming we’re Vit D deficient, so everything he was saying aligned with my personal experience. I know my family is a small sample, but I completely believe most of the population is immunosuppressed as well.</p>
<p>Even back when COVID first hit, my husband got a respiratory infection which the local doctor suspected might be COVID...he stressed the importance of Vit C, D, and zinc, to help him recover regardless of what the illness was. </p>
<p>I’ll definitely need to get into the habit of supplementing my vitamins...remembering is the hardest part, lol. Any suggestions for vitamin brands?</p>

        <p>Honestly I don't really have much advice on particular brands. I can tell you what I use tho.</p>
<p>Nutrabio ZMA- Vitamin B6, Magnesium and zinc in one pill. Take 3 daily before bed.</p>
<p>Then nature wise vitamin D3 10,000ui daily. Theyre inexpensive and do the job well for me. </p>
<p>And if it matters to you, Nutrabio ZMA is vegan based. All plant pills, gluten free, non gmo and lactose free.</p>
