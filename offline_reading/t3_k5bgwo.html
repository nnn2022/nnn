    <strong>A little rant ü•¥</strong>
    <p><p>I don‚Äôt understand the cognitive dissonance anymore.</p>
<p>Just saw a post in an ‚Äúam I the Karen‚Äù Reddit where some dumbass is UPSET THAT A DUDE WITH NO MASK BREATHED ON THE CARD READER/KEYPAD and then ASKS THE WORKER TO WIPE IT DOWN FOR THEM. First of all, how is that not ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù behavior without the extra BS of this plandemic? And they were going out for BEER. Dude, if you‚Äôre that worried, stay home. Or bring your own wipes. Honestly, people are so stupid that I can‚Äôt handle it anymore.</p>
<p>People are literally mad that other people have the audacity to breathe clean, fresh air.......</p></p>

        <p>LOL. I have used hand sanitizer only a handful of times the past couple of months. I go out in public, restaurants, bars, etc.  Still haven't gotten covid from touching any potentially dirty surfaces. People have turned into neurotic, hypochondriacs this year. I simply wash my hands after I use the washroom and that seems to be working just fine for me. Is everyone else's immune system that fragile?</p>
<p>I bet this person's phone has infinitely more germs on it than any surface at some ATM or card reader nowadays.</p>

        <p>For real! I‚Äôm so glad that common sense has been working well for you lol (that sounded a lot more sarcastic than I meant, sorry!). While we‚Äôre usually homebodies, we‚Äôve mourned the loss of things like dine-in services and the basic humanity of even being able to see someone else‚Äôs facial expression. My kids have received death threats and I have been kicked out of places for not wearing a mask (I have my own health/trauma issues for not doing so). All over something that most people, if they caught it, would recover from...</p>

        <p>i have hand sanitizer in my bag all the time just in case, but i also have a larger bottle of lotion for my poor dry hands! i too prefer to just wash my hands after i use the restroom or before/after a meal. common sense, really. but now people will always see that i have lotion and ask if they can use a bit, and of course the answer is yes, because their poor hands are so red and dry and cracked. yes, hand sanitizer is great, but people are way over going it. </p>
<p>i feel like a read an article a few years ago that kids born since 2000 and the rise of hand sanitizer actually have weaker immune systems than other age groups because they simply aren't allowed to take their immune system out for a try and give it a challenge. i mean... how else do we build immunity? kids are supposed to be gross snotty germ factories. they're supposed to put stuff in their mouths that doesn't belong there. they're building their immunity. all adults have been there and done that. what a disservice we're doing to our children! </p>
<p>my immune system has actually never been better. i can only say that i've been trying to take all my vitamins, get enough sleep, take longer walks, and eat a balanced-ish diet with plenty of water (8-10 glasses/day). i dare say my red wine intake is only making me stronger. </p>
<p>i'm an "essential employee" and we've been back in our office in-person, full time since June, and none of us have gotten sick. many of us ride public transit and we all get out of the office with other pods during the day. and we're all still going to restaurants, the gym, etc. we probably have been exposed to way more germs and viruses and bacteria than the average person since this spring and we're probably the only people challenging our immune systems at this time. </p>
<p>we all got super sick from last Thanksgiving through March 2020 and now just assume we all had covid-19 and spread it to each other, and now we're immune. that's what happens in an office after all. </p>
<p>these people are starting to seriously worry me. we can't live in an anti-viral bubble forever. this obsessive anxious behavior isn't healthy and i don't know how to help them dial it back.</p>

        <p>I actually don‚Äôt mind the free hand sanitizer everywhere. Not because I‚Äôm scared of covid, I just like having clean hands especially after touching things like gas pumps. I wish we could just have hand sanitizer readily available without any of the other bullshit.</p>
<p>Pro tip, that stuff is great for getting grease off your hands if you have to do something unexpected with your car.</p>

        <p>Totally understandable. I'm not opposed to using hand sanitizer if I feel I need it. Winter where I am can get very cold and dry. And unfortunately, hand sanitizer really helps dry my hands out and cracks the skin when it's cold out. Oh well, just the joys of living through Canadian winters.</p>
