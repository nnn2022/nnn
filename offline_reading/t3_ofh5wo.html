        <p>This is baaaad. Remember those pictures of a certain eastern European authoritarian leader, in which over the years, more and more people were edited out of the pictures?
Dr. Malone was an amazing asset to have in a toolbox of arguments to convince friends and family.
Now they'll just say 'hurr durr, I looked up the wiki snippet on google and that's very deep research which concludes he isn't the inventor of anything'.</p>

<p>“A lie can travel around the world and back again while the truth is lacing up its boots.”</p>
<p>—Mark Twain.</p>
<p>Robert Malone and I have been married for 42 years. Through ups and downs, good and bad, we have always been partners. Is this unique? No. Many people find a life partner; work and play together as a team. What maybe unique is our commitment to working together for the betterment of society. I am very lucky. Robert is brilliant. More than brilliant – he is someone that can take facts and use them to see into the future. Pattern recognition. This draws me like a butterfly to a flame.  As a life partner, I am vigilant in my protection of Robert – both of his reputation, his health and as a person. It is with that sense of needing to help shield him that I write this letter. Our careers are as independent researchers; we don’t have the luxury of an academic institution. Our consulting business and our philanthropic research relies on our support of each other.</p>
<p>As a young scientist, Robert saw into the future. He saw the future of RNA as a drug in 1987. Early in 1988, he foresaw the future of the use of mRNA for vaccination. He did this in the worst of situations. As a graduate student, without support of his thesis advisor and being in an abusive work/student environment. </p>
<p>(If you want the whole, terrible story and history of the discoveries, I suggest you read my piece linked here). </p>
<p>But this letter is not about that period so much as now. But a little back history is needed.</p>
<p>Robert is the inventor of mRNA vaccination. The documentation is clear. In 1986, while at the Salk Institute/UC San Diego as a MD (Northwestern)/PhD (Salk/UCSD) student, he worked with RNA for his dissertation. Early on this included structure and modeling analysis, but it soon expanded beyond that. In 1987, he invented naked and lipid mediated RNA transfection. in-vitro (1987) and in-vivo (1988) lipid mediated mRNA transfection were developed at the Salk/UCSD. But the situation in lab was not healthy, when the harassment got to the point, where Robert literally was diagnosed with severe PTSD from abuse at the hands of his thesis advisor and institutional attorneys, he knew he had to abandon his PhD and go back to Northwestern to finish his medical degree. His thesis advisor was the now infamous Dr. Inder Verma. Dr. Verma’s behavior abusing women and employees is now legendary and documented in both the scientific and lay press.</p>
<p>Robert left the university knowing that what he had invented would change the world someday. That he has never doubted.</p>
<p>Patent disclosures and a patent application were written and eventually filed on 3/21/89 for these technologies by the Salk. This included not only RNA transfection (RNA as a drug), but also technologies to stabilize the RNA and to increase production. Once it became clear that he would be leaving the Salk/UCSD, he stopped filing disclosures. So, he held on to the idea about RNA vaccination until he left the Salk. I have journal entries and he spoke with others about these ideas, so there is some documentation regarding this timeline. This resulted in the paper:</p>
<p>Cationic liposome-mediated RNA transfection RW Malone, PL Felgner, IM Verma. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) 86 (16), 6077-6081</p>
<p>When he left, he brought his research, reagents, DNA constructs, RNA constructs, and all the knowledge of these systems, including the use of the luciferase reporter gene assay for these technologies, which only he had, and ported them all into a small company called Vical. He didn’t really have any other option financially. It wasn’t ideal. But big promises were made by his supervisor about freedom to continue his research uninterrupted, which was critical to him. He knew that he had to go back and finish medical school, this was just an interim gig to support us and to prove that his discoveries worked, while I finished my BA. For Robert, the only thing that mattered was the science. Not the money, not the fame. It was about saving the world.</p>
<p>Long story short, as the only employee at Vical working in gene therapy, he sat down and disclosed all of his ideas for gene therapy and maybe more importantly, for mRNA vaccination almost as soon as he started at Vical. His supervisor at the time, Dr. Felgner, then over-signed the disclosures on top of Robert’s signature. Then, because Vical did not have vivisection facilities, a collaboration was set up with the University of Wisconsin to do the animal studies. Robert sent reagents, DNA, RNA and instructions to the researcher (Dr. Jon Wolff) there via Fedex and animals were injected. The rest is history.</p>
<p>Direct gene transfer into mouse muscle in vivo. Wolff JA, Malone RW, et al. Science. 1990;247(4949 Pt 1):1465-8.</p>
<p>Robert then wrote more patent disclosures, which included RNA vaccination and stabilization. Vical set up talks with the Salk to license Robert’s technology. These patents all have a priority date of 3/21/1989. Important because this is also the date that the Salk filed their patent. Showing that the Salk and Vical were working together in this. At that point, Robert was assured that Vical would license the Salk patent – as this was prior art. </p>
<p>As Robert’s supervisor soon took credit for much of his inventions, it was almost immediately clear that this short-term solution was just that. In August 1989, Robert went back to Northwestern to finish up medical school. He continued to support/consult for Vical without pay. He helped design the animal studies to prove that polynucleotide (DNA/RNA) worked in animal models. These experiments were conducted in 1989 and 1990 and there is documented data.  You still have that tool sir.. don't worry.. linkedin is the source 😂😂</p>

        <p>I’ve seen people using this to discredit Dr. Malone and calling him “disgruntled” because he is essentially being written out of history, and is not being acknowledged and praised for his life’s work. They claim that if it was his name on this mRNA vaccines that he wouldn’t be speaking out. L O L</p>

        <p>There is active debate asking for sources on naming him "the inventor of mRNA" as he seems to just have been a co-author on some papers on the potential of RNA in the 90s. The people who are trying to get his name on Wikipedia as the "inventor of mRNA" seem to be the ones with the agenda, as there is no academic source that confirms he was some major contributor to the technology, more so than others in the field at that time.</p>

        <p>Really you haven't a clue what you are talking about.</p>
<p>Honestly it's not you're fault. </p>
<p>https://sgtreport.com/2021/06/who-is-robert-malone/</p>
<p>Here's an agenda for you !</p>
<p>PANDEMIC MEDIA PROPAGANDA</p>
<p>Vaccinations - Can you really sell people anything?</p>
<p>This headline from the Guardian is one of those cases where I wonder how stupid they think we are. It reads: </p>
<p>"Why most people dying of covid in England who were vaccinated".</p>
<p>And here it comes:
"Don't think about this as a bad thing. It's just what you'd expect from an effective but not perfect vaccine."</p>
<p>A verbal "After Eight." Or brain fart. So if it's not a bad sign, then people dying from vaccination is a good thing. I also have a hard time reconciling the words "effective" and "not perfect" here. Unless you judge effectiveness by the deaths so far. </p>
<p>It took two people to write this nonsense. Apparently, the author Dream Team works together more often. David Spiegelhalter and Anthony Masters. Sounds like two characters from a dime novel. The experts published an article 3 months ago with the headline:</p>
<p>"Don't Fear AstraZeneca Vaccine, Risks Are Minimal".</p>
<p>So so. Minimal. To describe the possible death as minimal risk, that I would already equate to negligent homicide. How many reports of deaths after vaccination with AstraZeneca have been seen? And the same whistles are now telling people that it is a good thing when people die from vaccination. </p>
<p>These two unfunny comedians stand as an example of quite a few such experts. We have them everywhere. Who force us to wear an unnecessary face diaper. And want to urge us to vaccinate. Against all odds.</p>
<p>"The vaccine is safe." It is not, if more people die from it than without vaccination. There is also no guarantee of immunity after vaccination. </p>
<p>Even if people don't die from vaccination, there are also quite a few "side effects" that drastically change lives. There is not a single real argument why people should get vaccinated. </p>
<p>Can governments and the media be accused of anything other than malicious intent? Yet there are true mask fetishists. In England there is a woman running around distributing Jewish curses to mask refusers. And it was even once read that it is anti-Semitic not to get vaccinated. Since the vaccine manufacturers are almost all Jewish. One shows a special talent to point out things to the people, which they would not have become aware of by themselves. </p>
<p>If people live in fear of a "virus", then it is their decision whether they want to be vaccinated. Despite all the circumstances. I have no problem with that. However, I do have a big problem with people who attack us for not wanting to be vaccinated. </p>
<p>These people are truly zombies. There is no better description. ⚡️</p>

This included not only RNA transfection (RNA as a drug), but also technologies to stabilize the RNA and to increase production. Once it became clear that he would be leaving the Salk/UCSD, he stopped filing disclosures. So, he held on to the idea about RNA vaccination until he left the Salk. I have journal entries and he spoke with others about these ideas, so there is some documentation regarding this timeline. This resulted in the paper:</p>
<p>Cationic liposome-mediated RNA transfection RW Malone, PL Felgner, IM Verma. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) 86 (16), 6077-6081</p>
<p>When he left, he brought his research, reagents, DNA constructs, RNA constructs, and all the knowledge of these systems, including the use of the luciferase reporter gene assay for these technologies, which only he had, and ported them all into a small company called Vical. He didn’t really have any other option financially. It wasn’t ideal. But big promises were made by his supervisor about freedom to continue his research uninterrupted, which was critical to him. He knew that he had to go back and finish medical school, this was just an interim gig to support us and to prove that his discoveries worked, while I finished my BA. For Robert, the only thing that mattered was the science. Not the money, not the fame. It was about saving the world.</p>
<p>Long story short, as the only employee at Vical working in gene therapy, he sat down and disclosed all of his ideas for gene therapy and maybe more importantly, for mRNA vaccination almost as soon as he started at Vical. His supervisor at the time, Dr. Felgner, then over-signed the disclosures on top of Robert’s signature. Then, because Vical did not have vivisection facilities, a collaboration was set up with the University of Wisconsin to do the animal studies. Robert sent reagents, DNA, RNA and instructions to the researcher (Dr. Jon Wolff) there via Fedex and animals were injected. The rest is history.</p>
<p>Direct gene transfer into mouse muscle in vivo. Wolff JA, Malone RW, et al. Science. 1990;247(4949 Pt 1):1465-8.</p>
<p>Robert then wrote more patent disclosures, which included RNA vaccination and stabilization. Vical set up talks with the Salk to license Robert’s technology. These patents all have a priority date of 3/21/1989. Important because this is also the date that the Salk filed their patent. Showing that the Salk and Vical were working together in this. At that point, Robert was assured that Vical would license the Salk patent – as this was prior art. </p>
<p>As Robert’s supervisor soon took credit for much of his inventions, it was almost immediately clear that this short-term solution was just that. In August 1989, Robert went back to Northwestern to finish up medical school. He continued to support/consult for Vical without pay. He helped design the animal studies to prove that polynucleotide (DNA/RNA) worked in animal models. These experiments were conducted in 1989 and 1990 and there is documented data.</p>
