    <strong>COVID NUREMBERG TRIAL ADVANCING IN EUROPE</strong>
    <p><p>Link at end</p>
<p>May 1, 2021</p>
<p>The New Nuremberg Trials 2021</p>
<p>A team of more than 1,000 lawyers and 10,000 medical experts lead by Dr. Reiner Fullmich [a leading German lawyer and member of the German Corona Investigative Committee, who specializes in prosecuting fraudulent corporations] has begun legal proceedings over the CDC, WHO, and Bill Gates-allied World Economic Forum’s ‘Davos Group‘, for crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>Fullmich and his team indict the faulty PCR test and the order for doctors to label any comorbidity death as a COVID death as fraud.</p>
<p>According to the prosecution, the PCR test was never designed to detect pathogens and is 100% faulty. The unacceptable tests invalidate more than 90% of the alleged COVID infections.</p>
<p>In addition to the flawed tests, and fraudulent death certificates, the “experimental” vaccine violates Article 32 of the Geneva Convention. Under Article 32 of the 1949 Geneva Convention IV, “mutilation and medical or scientific experiments not necessitated by the medical treatment of a protected person” are prohibited. According to Article 147, conducting biological experiments on protected persons is a grave breach of the Convention.</p>
<p>The COVID Nuremberg trail is needed because the “experimental” vaccines violate all 10 of the Nuremburg Codes according to the litigators. These violations carry the death penalty for those violating these International Laws Fullmich’s advocates claim.</p>
<p>The “vaccine” fails to meet the following five requirements to be considered a vaccine, and is by definition a medical “experiment” and trial:</p>
<p>The Pfizer and Moderna Vaccines do NOT Provide immunity to the virus
This is a “leaky” gene-therapy that does not provide immunity to COVID. The vaccine is claimed to reduce symptoms. Yet skeptics claim that double-vaccinated people represent 60% of the patients requiring ER or ICU care.</p>
<p>Does NOT Protect recipients from getting the virus
Opponents argue, this gene-therapy does not provide immunity and double-vaccinated people can still catch and spread the virus.</p>
<p>Does NOT Reduce deaths from the virus infection
This gene-therapy does not reduce deaths from the infection. Double-Vaccinated infected with COVID have also died.</p>
<p>Does NOT Reduce circulation of the virus
This gene-therapy still permits the spread of the virus as it offers zero immunity to the virus.</p>
<p>Does NOT Reduce transmission of the virus
This gene-therapy still permits the transmission of the virus as it offers zero immunity to the virus.</p>
<p>The following violations of the Nuremberg Code are being alleged:</p>
<p>Nuremburg Code #1: Voluntary Consent is Essential</p>
<p>No person should be forced to take a medical experiment without informed consent. Many media, political and non-medical persons are telling people to take the shot, it’s safe and offer no information as to the adverse effects or dangers of this gene-therapy. Countries are using lockdowns, duress and threats to force people to take this vaccine or be prohibited to participate in free society under the mandate of a Vaccine Passport or Green Pass. During the Nuremberg trail, even the media was prosecuted and members were put to death for lying to the public amongst many of the doctors and Nazis found guilty of Crimes Against Humanity.</p>
<p>Nuremburg Code #2: Yield Fruitful Results Unprocurable By Other Means</p>
<p>As listed above, the gene-therapy does not meet the criteria of a vaccine and does not offer immunity to the virus. There are other medical treatments and remedies that yield fruitful results against COVID such as Ivermectin, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, chlorophyll, Zinc, OxySilverTM, and stress reduction that boosts immune systems against flu and colds.</p>
<p>Nuremburg Code #3: Base Experiments on Results of Animal Experimentation and Natural History of Disease</p>
<p>This gene-therapy skipped animal testing and went straight to human trials. In its mRNA vaccine research, Phizer used a candidate study on mRNA with rhesus macaques monkeys using BNT162b2 mRNA. In that study all the monkeys developed pulmonary inflammation, but the researchers considered the risk low as these were young healthy monkeys from the age of 2-4.</p>
<p>The International Court of Law has allegedly accepted a claim for 80% of the recipients having pulmonary inflammation from being injected with this gene-therapy. Despite this alarming development Pfizer proceeded to develop their mRNA “genetic therapy” for COVID without animal testing.</p>
<p>Nuremburg Code #4: Avoid All Unnecessary Suffering and Injury</p>
<p>Since the rollout of the U.S. experiment, the CDC VAERS reporting system cited more than 4,000 deaths and 50,000 vaccine injuries. In the EU more than 7,000 deaths and 365,000 vaccine injuries have been reported. This is a grievous violation of this code.</p>
<p>Nuremburg Code #5: No Experiment to be Conducted if There’s Reason to Think Injury or Death Will Occur</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned deaths and side effects, this “gene-therapy” is injurious and must be banned. Past research on mRNA vaccines also shows risks that have been ignored.</p>
<p>A 2002 study on SARS/Coronavirus spike proteins showed they cause inflammation, immunopathology, blood clots and impede Angiotensin 2 expression. The experimental vaccines force the body to produce this spike-protein imposing all these risks and much more.</p>
<p>Nuremburg Code #6: Risk Should Never Exceed the Benefit</p>
<p>COVID-19 has a 98-99% recovery rate. The vaccine deaths and adverse side-effects recklessly compete against this high natural recovery rate.</p>
<p>The use of “leaky” vaccines were banned for agricultural use by the US and EU due to the Marek Chicken study that shows ‘hot-viruses’ and variants emerge making the disease potentially even more deadly.</p>
<p>Yet, this science has been ignored despite similar implications in humans. The CDC and WHO knows these risks, including the likelihood of new deadlier variants emerging from these vaccinations.</p>
<p>Nuremburg Code #7: Preparation Must Be Made Against Even Remote Possibility of Injury, Disability or Death</p>
<p>There were no preparations made by Pfizer, Moderna or its backers. This gene-therapy was approved under an Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) only. That skipped animal and human trials, and permitted the dangerous vaccines to be forced on misinformed citizens.</p>
<p>Nuremburg Code #8: Experiment Must Be Conducted by Scientifically Qualified Persons</p>
<p>Politicians, media, and Hollywood actors claimed that these vaccines were “safe and effective,” but they were not qualified to judge.</p>
<p>Propaganda is not medical science.</p>
<p>Many retail outlets, such as Walmart, and even drive-through vaccine centers, are not qualified to administer experimental medical gene-therapies to the uninformed public.</p>
<p>Nuremburg Code #9: Anyone Must Have the Freedom to Bring the Experiment to an End At Any Time</p>
<p>Despite the outcry from more than 85,000 doctors, nurses, virologists, and epidemiologist, the experiment is not ending.</p>
<p>In fact, more attempts to change laws to force vaccine compliance are being pushed, and younger people are increasingly being targeted. Experimental ‘update’ shots are planned for every 6 months without any recourse to the deaths and injuries already caused.</p>
<p>Hopefully this new Nuremberg Trial will put an end to this crime against humanity.</p>
<p>Nuremburg Code #10: The Scientist Must Bring the Experiment to an End At Any Time if There’s Probable Cause of it Resulting in Injury or Death</p>
<p>It is clear in the statistical reporting data that this experiment is resulting in deaths and injuries. Yet all the politicians, drug companies, and so-called “experts,” are not making any attempt to stop this gene-therapy experiment from inflicting more harm on misinformed people.</p>
<p>What can you do to help put an end to this crime against humanity? Share this information. Make your politicians, media, doctors, nurses informed that if they are complicit in this crime. They too are subject to the laws set forth in the Geneva Convention and Nuremburg code and can be tried, found guilty, and even put to death.</p>
<p>Legal proceedings are moving forward. Evidence has been collected, and a large growing body of experts are sounding alarms.</p>
<p>Visit the COVID Committee website at: [link to corona-ausschuss.de and if you have been affected by this crime. Report your “adverse event” the people involved, and as many details as you can recall, to the following website:</p>

<p>Crimes against humanity affect us all. They are damaging you, your children, your parents, your grandparents, your community, your country, and your future.</p>

        <p>Dr Fuellmich himself is a better resource than this oft reposted text.</p>
<p>He is indeed working on this cause, but his assertion is 80-100 lawyers. Watch the interview and the news updates on his site for more accurate information.</p>
