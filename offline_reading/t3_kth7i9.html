    <strong>There’s always hope!</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone. Don’t take the black pill. Take the white pill. I’m not saying don’t complain or grieve the serious losses our society is facing. But understand humanity still has it better than the generations before us. If you are interested in the case for the “white pill” check out Michael Malice (also shout out to Dave Smith, but he’s more politically focused than malice). Malice has a very unique take on politics and explains why we should not lose hope, both in general and in consideration of the lockdowns and evil mandates. He is good at making you feel good about how vulnerable the ruling class is. The book he is writing right now is called “The White Pill”. Check him out, it took me a minute to get used to him, but he’s got a lot of political wisdom. He expresses his views clearly, but also has guests on his shows ranging from pretty far right to pretty far left and is good at building bridges. </p>
<p>It’s very encouraging seeing some sanity in this sub on Reddit of all places.</p>
<p>I’m a Christian so I don’t agree with everything he says, but politically he has a great understanding. Also Jesus loves all of you! Wish everyone the best.</p>
<p>Edit: someone had requested, so here is a link to a very recent interview. Yes he is dressed like that with a certain haircut on purpose. https://youtu.be/uykM3NhJbso</p></p>

        <p>Amen to this, and I'm not even religious. The most morally and mentally corrupt people are the ones who have the loudest voices on TV and in the streets, so pay no heed to their chants. Remember that the good people of our species are far stronger than the weak by a landslide. </p>
<p>Even if this ends up lasting generations, remember that chaos comes and goes and humanity will ultimately come out stronger in the end, with our people leading the way :)</p>
