    <strong>A parody of The Sneeches by Dr. Seuss</strong>
    <p><p>I am the author of this parody, with no apologies to Dr. Seuss. </p>
<pre><code>A parody of the "The Sneetches"-By Dr. Seuss

Now, the Face-Masked Sneetches feared the new SARs.
The Plain-Faced Sneetches had none upon thars.
Those masks weren’t so thick. The virus is so small.
You might think such a thing wouldn’t stop COVID at all.

But, because they wore masks, the Faced-Masked Sneetches could snitter
Would brag, “We’re the best kind of Sneetch on Facebook and Twitter.”
With their snoots smothered, they would sniff and they’d snort
“We’ll have nothing to do with the Plain-Faced sort!”
And, whenever they met some, in the Walmart they were walking,
They’d hike over to them and give them a good talking.

Due to the lockdown no children could play ball,
Could a Face-Masked play a game? Not even at all.
They only could play ego games on Twitter over the mask,
And if you are ever seen not wearing one, they take you to task.

When the Plain Faced Sneetches had frankfurter roasts
Or picnics or parties or marshmallow toasts,
It produced howls of outrage from the Face-Masked Sneetches.
They made them dine out alone in cold, and closed down their beaches.
They kept them away from each other. Never let them come near.
And that’s how they plotted to treat them year after year.

Then ONE day, it seems while the Plain-Faced Sneetches
Were moping and doping alone longing for beaches.
Just sitting there wishing this would end like SARS,
A stranger zipped up in the strangest of cars!

“My friends”, he announced in a voice high and clean,
“My name is Billy Henry Gates, trust me I’m not mean.
And I’ve heard of Your troubles. I’ve heard you’re unhappy.
But I can fix that, I’m the Jab-You-Up Chappie

I’ve come here to help you.
I have what you need.
And my prices are low. And I work with great speed.
But whatever immunity and safety is not one hundred per cent guaranteed!”

Then, quickly, Billy Henry Gates with a sinister gleam
Put together a very peculiar scheme.
And he said, “You want this to disappear like SARS and be a free Sneetch?
My friends, this can be solved with a little government overreach!”

“Just give me your tax money and its all above board!”
So they were forced inside their homes, Then the Big Pharma machine roared.
And it klonked. And it bonked. And it jerked. And it berked.
But who knows if the vaccine will actually work?

When the Face-Masked Sneetches popped out, they had the Jab!
They actually did, but a number of them felt very bad!
Indeed, some of them were doing quite lousy,
A couple of them even got Bell’s Palsy.

Then they yelled at the ones who had masks at the start,
“We’re still the best Sneetches and they are next to the worst.
But now, how in the world will we know”, they all frowned,
“If which kind is what, or the other way round?”

Then up came Fauci with a very sly wink.
And he said, “Things are not quite as bad as you think.
So you don’t know who’s who. That is perfectly true.
But come with me, friends. Do you know what I’ll do?
I’ll make you, again, the best Sneetches.
And all it will cost you is less breathing eaches.”

“Single masks are no longer in style”, said Fauci on TV.
“What you need is to do increase your masking routine.
This wondrous contraption will make the virus disappear like SARS
And you won’t look like Sneetches that have a single mask on thars.”
That propaganda was working very precisely
The Face-Masked Sneetches added another mask, quite nicely

Then, with snoots twice buried in cloth, they paraded about.
And with muffled beaks and they let out a shout,
“We know who is who! Now there Isn’t a doubt.
The best kind of Sneetches are Sneetches with a two mask amount!”

Then, of course, those with one mask got all frightfully mad.
To not be wearing two mask was frightfully bad.
Then, of course, old Fauci on the TV,
invited THEM into his three mask routine.

Then, of course from THEN on, as you probably guess,
Things really got into a horrible mess.

All the rest of that day, the opposition was barren,
The Jab-You-Up Chappie kept Jabbing up Sneetch Karens.
In again! Out again! In again! Out again!  
Another mask layer, they added again and again!

Changing their masks every minute or two. They kept paying money.
They kept running through until the Plain nor the Face-masks knew
Whether this one was vaxxed once or that one was vaxxed two. Or which one
Was vaxxed will spread the Wu-flu.

Then, when every last cent of their money was spent,
The Jab-You-Up Chappie implemented the Great Reset.
And he laughed as he drove In his electric car alone up the beach,
“They never will learn. No. You can’t Teach a Sneetch!”

In order to leave their humble abode,
Each Sneetch had to produce the proper QR code.
Deprived of all money they had to become frugal,
Their thoughts and movements controlled by Google.

The streets of their cities were patrolled by Antifa thugs.
Living in pods, they were forced to eat bugs.

Their world in tatters, they became slaves.
Some Sneetches wondered, why they weren’t more brave.
They watched too much TV. They weren’t up for the task,
to know their oppression started with the mask.

They accepted it without question.  They gave their consent.
No one would protest, now their tale is one of lament.

        <p>Hehe.  This is wonderful.</p>
<p>I've thought so many times about the Sneetches this past year.  It's such a good analogy for the world right now.</p>
