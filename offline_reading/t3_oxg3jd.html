        <p>&rt;Like most of the military, Myers had chosen to get vaccinated - but was exposed just a day after getting his first dose in January, not enough time for it to take effect.</p>
<p>&rt;"He was really excited to be doing his part for society and for his family. He wouldn’t have imagined three weeks later he would die alone in a hospital," his sister, Amber Mattson, wrote on a Facebook post, imploring people to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Came down with symptoms after getting the shot, the narrative twisted this story into him getting it 'too late'.</p>

        <p>All the other subs that posted this article have literally every comment ALL for this. Everyone is saying “about time” and that we signed our rights away when we enlisted….blah blah bullshit. They’re  Saying we get all these other vaccines already and it’s not a big deal. As much as I’d not want to get an anthrax vaccine, if I deployed to a place that I needed it for…. I’d take it just because people have been getting it for years and you don’t hear of anyone getting to F’ed up way later. I wouldn’t want to cause an unnecessary issue with my command over something like that. This one though…….. I’m honestly already looking for apartments in the event that I need to sign a lease in the coming months when I get kicked out for not getting it. There is no way in actual hell I’ll take it. I’m in a weird place right now with all of this. It should be an honor to serve and defend our freedom but I just feel like there is no point and I don’t feel that honor anymore. It makes me sad to even admit that. I feel like for every 100 active duty members who don’t want it, 80 or more will be bullied into giving in because it’s their livelihood. I feel like I need to trust my gut on this stuff and the universe will sort itself out for me in the end. I have the worst feeling that years from now something big will come from all of this and maybe just maybe these evil leaders who pushed all of this will admit that it was a mistake to force it on everyone. Why anyone would do something irreversible to their body that literally NO ONE knows what potential harm could come years down the road is absolutely beyond me. A job isn’t even a good enough validation. Any job that bullies me into a choice like that is not for me. I don’t even care what my consequences are for refusing this vaccine with the military. People say court martial is possible….. looks like I’ll really be showin out when I leave haha all because I chose my health and wellness that will affect me every second of everyday for the rest of my life.</p>
