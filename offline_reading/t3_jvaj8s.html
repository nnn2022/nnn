        <p>Germany, the UK, Australia and Canada are "about the same" as before? üëΩ it's good to see Freedom House acknowledging this situation is being misused for political purposes, but it's disappointing to see them showing more forgiveness towards the traditionally "democratic" nations and echoing the narrative of blaming the Trump administration for the situation in America. </p>
<p>It's also sad to see them downplaying the severe emotional and economic toll the authoritarian measures themselves have taken, and the way individual freedom was essentially taken hostage by governments all around the world (and used as a way to vilify anyone who disagrees).</p>
<p>"Free" is a category that doesn't exist anymore in real life.</p>

        <p>Yes, this paints an unrealistically rosy picture of USA affairs too. no account for disruption in legislative meeting, but in my state the legislature has not convened since the start of the plandemic!</p>
<p>It is important to make the correlation between the loss of real freedoms in western democracies and how that translates in places already challenged by corrupt government:</p>
<p>From the piece: </p>
<p>" In another, Zimbabwe, ‚ÄúCOVID-19 has also been used to arrest, abduct,  rape, assault, and intimidate human rights activists, opposition party  leaders/supporters, civil society leaders, journalists, and other  dissenting voices on ‚Äòallegations of violating lockdown conditions.‚Äô‚Äù </p>
<p>When people wave the lockdown wand it shouldn't only matter what happens in your own neighborhood.</p>
