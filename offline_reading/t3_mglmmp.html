        <p>People have died and they always will. The US death rate didn’t change from 2019-2020. 2020 death date was on par with the previous year. Also the average Infected fatality age is higher than the national average age of death. </p>
<p>I’m not going to get the vaccine because it’s not tested nor is it approved by the FDA. I’m a licensed EMT and I still have no desire to get it. I had several family members and close family friends die with COVID. Except they all had either heart disease, cancer of some sort, or were really fucking old. </p>
<p>Fuck off. My body my choice. Less than 1% of people will die of COVID. Way less than 1% actually. And I don’t think we should all put our lives on hold for that small amount. I think those people should put their lives on hold for themselves. </p>
<p>P.S. If English is your first language, you should focus on that and mind your own business, if it’s not your first language you’re doing pretty good.</p>

        <p>Same argument, other direction:</p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mgkvzo/usa_teen_deaths_rise_20_from_april_2020/</p>
<p>Look how many kids died from the impacts of lockdowns (since nearly none died from covid).  Next time you see some family who no longer has their teenager, tell them how important it is to have kids at home instead of at school, how their sacrifice is so important so the elderly in nursing homes can live an extra month or two.  (Because the majority of the deaths are in nursing homes and 85+.)  I'm sure they'll all agree their children's mental anguish and suicide was a fair trade.</p>

        <p>Kids should not be in or around masks.  They're unhealthy to wear, bad for brain development not seeing others' expressions and word formation, and of course, there's no evidence they do anything at all to impact disease spread.</p>

        <p>I would happily go talk to the families of people who have died, and tell them that their older, chronically ill relatives led lives that hopefully, they were proud of, and that those lives were filled with so many connections and achievements that they can be proud of, to say that person was in their family. As they grieve, I would hope that they memorialize this person as the person would want to be remembered, and can access support in their community to help them do that. That person wasn’t just a statistic that died from a virus or sickness, they were someone who likely lived a lot of amazing years and leaves behind the legacy of their extended families and whoever else they were to their community. </p>
<p>In many of these cases, it’s possible that dying of “covid” was the end of a battle with previous illness and regardless of spiritual beliefs or anything like that- it’s a fact that the person is no longer suffering, and these families can take comfort in that. Death will happen to all of us. It’s the life that you lived and leave behind that matters- not how you die or when. </p>
<p>Even if the person died younger or “wasn’t sick”- I would hope that their families can value the lives that they had- just like we do for all tragic and sudden losses. No family who loses a loved one would focus specifically on how they died, erasing all they were before. families of Victims of violent crime, for example, might spend the rest of their lives fighting for new laws or for the perpetrators to never be released- but very few will refer to their loved one as only ever a victim of someone’s actions- they will always be a person who was lost unexpectedly, but was all the things they were in life before that. </p>
<p>If you think about the best qualities that someone who you have lost had- it’s very likely that sacrificing others for themselves, isn’t one of them. None of the elderly people who died of Covid were sitting up at their house, happy to see people’s lives destroyed to keep them alive for just a few more years. People with life limiting disabilities for the most part, understand that their lives and lifespans may be limited- and don’t let it stop them from trying to live it to the fullest. Someone with a severe disabling condition who would have had to stay inside with no exceptions for the past year, wouldn’t be thrilled to watch others suffer and die of suicide and addictions “for them”. </p>
<p>If you believe people who are at risk are that vindictive and frankly, evil, your view of the world is just so fucked up.</p>

        <p>You can memorialize the people who died by wearing a mask and getting a vaccine. No other countries had a outbreak like america and that is because when the government told them to go home and stay there for 2 weeks they did it and they where done. We would not have to memorialize them if the government was actually good at doing there job and the citizens can out down there life for a little bit for the good of everyone. And if we did that like england we would have been done with lockdown months ago.</p>

        <p>i don’t even disagree with this, I would absolutely do this if we knew the vaccines and masks were effective. </p>
<p>But, even the CDC themselves say that masks won’t prevent 100% spread in real-life circumstances, and even if you have the vaccine, you can still transmit the virus and be infected, at massive risk to yourself due to side effects. </p>
<p>So no, the best way to honour people is recognize that we need to save the ones who are still alive.</p>

        <p>You so got a point masks are not 100% I fell like there should be a way to stop the spread a d not shut down. But I fell like there will be a major dip In cases once the vaccine really gets distributed.</p>
