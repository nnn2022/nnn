        <p>It is hard. Yes, covid sucks. And probably a bit more then a bad flu season. There is no need to deny the harsh truth of working in icu. It is important though to fight for our freedom to take whatever risk.. and protect our bodily integrity.</p>

        <p>That’s what I was thinking. Kind of expected in an ICU anyway. It sucks that some people are dealing with the worst of it, but we can’t continue living life like this. Everyone needs to be a little more cautious and not let their guard down. The security theater with masks aren’t helping at all.</p>

        <p>Thing is that top comment has all the buzzwords.  The “ frontlines” type of speaking. In each of these stories there’s always someone who is thinking it’s “ fake” and giving some new horror story and acting like it’ll happen to everyone </p>
<p>I’m not skeptical this is happening but then again I’m sure this understaffing etc happens during bad flu seasons</p>

        <p>And much of the staffing problems are the fault of covid protocols that are forcing healthy people to quarantine.</p>

        <p>always a great idea to question your skepticism.
i recommend to check r/nursing for front line experiences and ask questions</p>

        <p>Thank you! My sister is a nurse and was sent to the COVID floor in NJ in the beginning of the pandemic so I was getting firsthand experiences. I just question a lot because of how hypocritical many of these health professionals are. I’m not denying that some places are getting hit hard, but we can’t say it’s like this across the country. I have a lot to say but need to go for right now! </p>
<p>Thanks, will be following nursing subreddit now :)</p>

        <p>interesting. maybe you can discuss this with her:</p>
<p>as i jnderstand, the main problem in the hospitals seems to be understaffing. why? </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>staff tests positive and has to stay home (with the validity of the tests being questionable)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loads of security theater stresses staff out and makes them leave. special covid units for any patient that tests positive (with the validity of the tests being questionable), and staff having to wear special clothes, change masks and clothes every few minutes, having to tube-in patients more than ever before - &rt; the tubing being questionable regarding effective and many patients dieing. stressful!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more patients than ever. is that true? or are the 2 points above a reason for that? = restructuring the hospitals because of covid</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>if the hospitals (and the whole planet basically) would treat covid just EXACTLY as pneumonia and flu,what would be different?</p>
<ul>
<li>there still would be in-tubing patients, but far less i assume. only the incredibly extreme cases.</li>
<li>staff would be less stressed, no security theater, no forced staff quarantines (no tests) = no understaffing</li>
<li>hospitals and icus would be structured normally, also resulting in a total of more beds generally, compared to actual situation now.</li>
</ul>
<p>remember
-&rt; even if treating covid exactly like a flu, some hospitals will be overrun and staff will be stressed as fuck in certain parts of certain countries. it ALWAYS has been like that.</p>
<p>i would like health care workers and doctors opinion on these points</p>
