    <strong>[Documentary Film] Follow the Science: On Lockdowns and Liberty</strong>
    <p><p>"In recent episodes I have called on documentary filmmakers to embark on the ultimate anti-Fauci project: a documentary covering COVID and the absurd response. And although it should include the charts that tell the story, it should also tell real stories — human-interest stories of people who were devastated by the lockdowns. Well, I’m happy to report that a group of talented filmmakers will be doing precisely that, and in today’s episode one of them joins us to lay out his vision."</p>
<p>From The Tom Woods Show Episode 1885: <a href="http://tomwoods.com/ep-1885-join-us-for-the-ultimate-anti-fauci-project/">http://tomwoods.com/ep-1885-join-us-for-the-ultimate-anti-fauci-project/</a>  </p>

<p>2020 was an unprecedented year in human history. The advent of SARS-CoV-2 was a catalyst for deep societal division and turmoil, government action unparalleled in the modern liberal world, and the severe disruption of long-accepted norms of human interaction and commerce.</p>
<p>Some of the most profound divisions resulted from divergent interpretations of the data, conflicting beliefs about how risk should be handled on a social level, and contradictory understandings of the appropriate role of governmental institutions in solving crises. These rifts were exacerbated by the politicization of what should have been a purely scientific matter.</p>
<p>The mainstream narrative, professed by the vast majority of politicians and media personalities, largely accepted  – without question –  that disruptive <strong>lockdowns and mask mandates</strong> were critical tools for solving the crisis of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Those who challenged this conventional wisdom were often mocked, bullied and de-platformed. Those who suggested that there might be better solutions or who warned of dire consequences, potentially even more severe than the virus itself, were shunned and accused of being irrational and heartless.</p>
<p><strong><em>Follow the Science: On Lockdowns and Liberty</em></strong> examines this tension between the mainstream narrative and those challenging it, dives deeply into the data, and tells the stories of lives disrupted and damaged by the sweeping choices that were made, focusing largely on the American landscape.</p>
<p><strong>This project will have two phases:</strong> PHASE ONE will be a 20-30 minute documentary that will focus largely on the data and the personal stories and will likely be released in the Fall of 2021. PHASE TWO will be a feature-length documentary that will build on the material from the shorter version and will spend more time analyzing the causes of the deep division and the implications for the future.  This second-phase, full-length documentary should be released sometime in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>We need your help to get the first phase of this project made!</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who recognizes that the truth of the pandemic situation may be more nuanced than we have been led to believe by our politicians and pundits will want to support this endeavor.</li>
<li>Anyone who values a truly scientific, data-driven approach to understanding the pandemic and is skeptical that the public officials have sufficient answers to cavalierly and severely disrupt the lives of individuals around the globe will find this documentary worthy of their donation.</li>
<li>Anyone who understands that the underpinnings of civilization itself are being threatened, both through the unprecedented use of government force and the suppression of heterodox viewpoints, will want to get behind this project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our mission is to get this perspective out into the world in a highly engaging and persuasive format in order to prevent these kinds of invasive and divisive approaches from ever being implemented again.</p></p>

        <p>You asked people to find evidence to support your conclusions? That’s not how it works. You’re supposed to gather the evidence and then draw conclusions. Asking people to find evidence to debunk Fauci is literally asking for biased input. </p>
<p>The term ‘grifting’ comes to mind. There’s plenty of anti science propaganda out there already.</p>

        <p>Will this still be relevant when it’s fully released? By 2022 most people will be vaccinated with probably over half the population having received their second dose. The future of COVID-19 is uncertain but it’s likely that sometime in 2022, things will be mostly back to normal with some minor precautions and hopefully all governments being on-guard for outbreaks.</p>

        <p>Vaccines have cured diseases before, why not COVID? This may seem non-relevant but you’re saying that even if COVID is mostly gone, the government will keep the safety measures up and somehow eventually try to take away our rights and control us. That’s not believable to most people without enough solid evidence besides mask mandates and lockdowns to prevent the spread of a dangerous disease. Quick reminder that I am not trying to criticize anyone, I’m just trying to understand the people here.</p>

        <p>3/4 of the worlds Polio cases are now vaccine strain lol. Mainstream sources. Hygiene, modern plumbing, and refrigeration are the overwhelming forces behind reduced disease proliferation. Oh, and for bonus points, look up the "Cutter Incident." 465,000+ people were given live polio virus with the initial rollout. Not to mention retroviruses in the form of SV-40 monkey virus. Have fun!</p>

        <p>We've considered that, and while we don't necessarily think that everything will return to normal, we do feel that it's important to show what happened, what was done, what worked, and what didn't work so that we can avoid making the same mistakes in future (inevitable) pandemics.</p>
<p>To this end, the feature will have a little bit of a retrospective tone to it. A historical look at what happened.</p>

        <p>I agree, as I said the future of COVID is uncertain and I think that as long as this documentary is not that biased and doesn’t use spread misinformation, I think it is a good idea.</p>
