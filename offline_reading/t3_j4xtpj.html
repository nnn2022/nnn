        <p>My brother committed suicide yesterday due to the lockdown situation. He lived in Toronto, and I live in the USA, so I will probably never get to say goodbye or get any kind of closure. We weren't close, and now we will never be. It just breaks my heart to know that he spent his last moments cold, alone, and probably believing every word of the media fearmongering with no end in sight. </p>
<p>What ever happened to "even one death is too many"? The damage has already been done, and there is no bringing back the lives that have already been lost around the world. These restrictions are a global violation of human rights and anyone who advocates for them to continue for even one more moment should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

        <p>After spending my childhood being hyper controlled by abusive parents now I have to waste my adulthood being hyper controlled by the government. It’s very depressing. The world feels like a giant mental hospital. I don’t mean that as in the world is crazy I mean people are treating people like you treat people in mental hospitals.</p>

        <p>I've been the opposite of you. I had a free and relatively good childhood. Sure, I had my ups and downs because of teenager problems, school was boring etc. But most of the time I just lived normally and my family was nice.</p>
<p>Nowadays there's a very controlling society and going from a free daily life to a restrictive daily life is a huge change in my life. It's like for a wealthy free man to become poor and imprisoned. People who used to think "do whatever float your boat, girl" became "have you remembered putting on your mask?"</p>

        <p>I am sick this week-terrible head cold and I’m miserable. I don’t get sick often at all, and I’m convinced this is because of all their stupid security theater bs-wiping down everything one could possibly touch in stores/restaurants/everyone staying away from each other etc. I want the damn germs so I can continue to have a healthy immune system that builds resistance to them, but no instead I get the everything has been disinfected and we have fancy air sanitizers and you have to stay 6ft apart in the checkout line or somebody yells at you shit and end up sick as a dog. Very annoyed right now.  Funny thing is, I had covid earlier this year and the cold I have now is 100x worse. </p>
<p>Also, my uncle wears a mask everywhere he goes, I mean even in the car, and he has the same awful cold this week. Masks sure do work don’t they! /s</p>

        <p>Right? I may had only gotten a C in biology class that one term but even I know that you need exposure to germs in order for your immune system to work properly 
And i dont believe in masks either

        <p>Just tried to watch the “amazing” speech by Biden and I couldn’t get through the whole thing. He started talking about “another 200k deaths by next year if we don’t wear masks” and I just about had an aneurism. Please don’t vote for this man. Vote for Mickey Mouse if you can’t stand Trump but for the love of God don’t vote Democrat this year.</p>

        <p>I hear you on that, totally. At least a lot of restaurants and bars haven't cared that I left my mask off, when talking to servers and remaining seated at my table. For the record if you don't know, Gov. Pritzker in Illinois imposed that rule in August. Yes, such a silly rule was imposed that if you talk to your server while sitting at your table, you have to put your mask on. I don't agree with that, especially since usually I don't talk to people and stare directly in their eye, and stare a little indirectly at them.</p>

        <p>This has been itching my mind since yesterday, so here it is...</p>
<p>I'm in Europe and while it's not as bad as it is in the USA (afaik, with how the US handles this) but it's getting worse and I feel shitty over it.</p>
<p>I originally had hopes that it'd die down a bit after summer as the numbers showed that this virus isn't so bad after all, yet it's as though we've learned <em>nothing</em> and I hate that realization, because it makes me feel like there's no rationality or even empathy to any of this, meaning that I can't expect leaders (and a lot of people) to be sane and reasonable... they'll likely stretch this <em>forever.</em></p>
<p>At my work we have <em>laughable</em> measures, one of them being having to wear a mask when you walk for any reason. Because I don't believe in it, think it's ridiculous and really not helping anyone at all, I hate it, and it feels kind of humiliating. I hate being forced to wear that ridiculous, gross, ugly, uncomfortable piece of fabric with a ''use'' that I don't believe in. I hate having every movement controlled by others.</p>
<p>And they want to leave the window open as much as possible while the heating is broken... yeah. It's freezing and I can't work like that.</p>
<p>I'm also getting fed up with my friends. They're <em>zero</em> risk and don't work with fragile elderly or anything... yet they want to meet up in the most impractical and difficult ways because of these rules. Fun is forbidden now, and we can only meet outside.... one wants us to picnic in the cold. Maybe we could turn it into an autumn picnic with hot pumpkin soup or something but I just hate the reason for it. I could somewhat tolerate this nonsense during the spring, but now that it's <em>obviously</em> ridiculous and pointless? And it's getting colder? I feel like clawing my eyes out it's so pointless and needlessly difficult.</p>
<p>I'm so fed up with this bullshit and I hate how I'm <em>forced</em> to do things that I really don't believe in. I don't even live in a country where measures are particularly bad, but I still want to vent a bit... and I hate having the idea of even stricter measures hanging over my head. (and this stupid stuff of ''be grateful that your work is still open!'' No. Cut it out. ) (they're threatening with even more restrictions)</p>

        <p>&rt;I'm in Europe and while it's not as bad as it is in the USA (afaik, with how the US handles this) but it's getting worse and I feel shitty over it.</p>
<p>This really depends on where you are in the US. It's like two different countries here. Places like Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, South Dakota are doing great and are pretty close to normal. But if you're in California...well good luck with that.</p>

        <p>Speaking of strict lockdown measures and Europe, I remember reading one of the European countries (maybe France?) back in like March or April required people going to something as little as a grocery store (or ____ other essential business) to download a pdf note, fill it out, and show it to any cops who might question you over that. If you didn't show that to an asking officer, you could be fined a certain amount of money. Honestly, screw rules like that, and government shouldn't be intervening in the personal lives of what individuals do when they are out.</p>

        <p>Yesterday, my father ranted a bit about "those maskless idiots".</p>
<p>My dad has never a day in his life fully supported himself, not because he can't afford to, but because he doesn't want to. He never learned to cook until his girlfriend of 19 years passed away, meaning he <em>had</em> to do the cooking. When I had a car accident, he never expressed concern for my well-being, but was utterly devastated about the car being totaled. Then, he had an absolute fit because I was not ready to drive again right away, and that I wouldn't immediately buy another car (despite I legit couldn't afford to).</p>
<p>My point with this little vent is it's both funny and irritating to hear someone whose priorities have never been in good order (and this does extend to my childhood - Dad made it clear he did not want to be a father) rant about people not wearing masks.</p>
<p>Similarly, he asked me why I didn't post anything on Facebook about my late grandmother's birthday. I don't use Facebook often, so I don't post much. I don't think I need Facebook to remember my grandma.</p>

        <p>I know how you feel. I believed in "flatten the curve" and all the rest at first. It is so hard to realize you have been lied to. I don't know exactly what you mean by "can't take it anymore" but I just want to tell you to please stay with us. We are fighting for you and need each other too much.</p>
<p>I know how hopeless it looks, but don't give in to the despair. Just remember how much humanity has already been stripped away and resolve to not give them another inch. Unlike the fear mongers, we really are in this together. We may feel alone, but we give each other the strength to rise against. If you ever feel small and outnumbered, keep in mind that it is the empty barrel that makes the most noise.</p>
<p>I know reddit is but a small corner of the internet, but I have gotten so much support here it is unreal. Don't be afraid to check in here if you need to talk. Stay strong.</p>

        <p>I know how it is. Just remember that they are the vocal minority. They wouldn't be trying to censor us if they were winning. Think of all the ridiculous conspiracy theories out there and how the media reacts. Nobody bans flat eathers, fake moon landings, Elvis sightings, etc. Those are either ignored or brought out and laughed at. We are being censored because the media is afraid the tide is turning. We may not be able to drown them out, but we can turn the tide one drop at a time until we become a flood that can't be stopped.</p>

        <p>I feel like I’m going to break any day now. I’m medically exempt so I don’t have to wear a mask but work still forces me to wear a face shield and I have issues with that as well. I feel like I’m constantly going to have a panic attack and always on the brink of tears. If anyone says anything to me I can barely respond. I feel like it’s inhumane to live like this. I don’t think theres anything more I can do about it, I already fought not to wear a mask, and I can’t afford to lose my job and I feel like anywhere else would be worse.  I already brought in a doctors note for face coverings after fighting my doctor for it and possibly losing my doctor, and they won’t accept exemptions for face shields. If anyone has any advice on what else I may be able to do, or ways you guys calm yourself down when facing mask anxiety, I’d highly appreciate it.</p>

        <p>First, thank you for fighting for these things.  It is, like you say, inhumane for them to force these things on you, whether or not they argue it is 'legal'. </p>
<p>You said you feel like other jobs would be worse.  I would encourage you to continue to look for such jobs, even if it's only a few minutes each day.  In about a week I will be mask free at my jobs and at the stores I go to, but at first I thought I couldn't find anything either.  I am in a state with a mask mandate, though not the worst mandate for sure.  Are you open to considering jobs that involve driving or online jobs?  I don't know your situation, but that was how I started my search.  </p>
<p>I would also consider moving to a less restricted area, even if it's something you have to work towards and that wouldn't happen right away.  But I know that is not possible for everyone either.</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to respond, this is solid advice.</p>
<p>My cars pretty new so I don’t really want the ware and tear on it, but I’m heavily considering delivery. Online jobs would be an option too. I haven’t worn a mask to any stores since the mandate in my province/ city and it hasn’t been too much of an issue. I get looks and the odd comment, but thats about it. </p>
<p>Good to hear you will no longer gave to wear a mask for work!</p>

<p>If you're forced to wear one, try customizing the way it fits. I get overwhelmed by mine too but making it comfortable made it less intolerable. Easier to push through anxiety alone than anxiety plus an irritated face, I guess.</p>

        <p>I understand it’s uncomfortable reading but please take a look at r/Suicidewatch and r/depression and see how many people are citing Covid/lockdown as a reason for wanting to kill themselves or self-harm. Calling people wusses and selfish pricks for feeling like this is really not helpful. We do care about others here it’s just that we believe that the second-order effects of this policy are far more harmful than the virus itself.</p>

        <p>Someone is going through my post history to quote things I said yesterday lol</p>
<p>Keeps saying I want to kill my mother because I don't wear a mask, nevermind that <em>she</em> doesn't want me to, and would rather see her loved ones' unmasked faces. Says they would wear a mask to protect their mother whether she wants them to or not because her health is more important than her own wishes. Case in point: these people really don't care about whether or not the at-risk actually want protected. They care more about blindly extending the lives of the elderly and infirm than actually making those lives worth living.</p>
<p>And of course I'm un-American for having such a perspective, the only reason I oppose mask mandates is to "own the libs" even though I'm lib-center lol</p>
<p>EDIT: Person just asked me if I would let my mom kill someone if she thought it would be best for her.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Now they just asked me if I would let my mom molest me. I let my mom make her own medical decisions based on her own risk tolerance and personal priorities, I would only consider wearing a mask to protect her if she explicitly wanted me to, so naturally I'm an anti-science nutter who would let her go on a killing spree and sexually assault me because mommy knows best. These people think <em>we're</em> nutters?</p>

        <p>Had the best eye appt yesterday, my husband and I were in the exam room with back to back appointments, and the optometrist came in the room and asked how it was going as glasses wearers with having to wear masks inside places (state order), and both of us said it was a pain, and they said we could take it off while we were in the exam room as long as we were ok with them not wearing theirs either. It was like time-traveling back to 2019 lol.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As I was getting up to switch chairs with my husband for his exam, the optometrist started reaching for the cleaning bottle to wipe stuff down, and my husband asked, "Would you have cleaned that pre-March for related patients?" Optometrist said nope, put the bottle back down, and moved on with his exam. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The whole time they were doing the exam, they were chatting with us about how silly the orders were and how all the restrictions were doing was just delaying the inevitable and we should just rip off the bandaid and get on with life.</p>

        <p>Lol, no they didn’t. If you have a licensed physician, of any sort, tell you something like this, then you probably shouldn’t go back to them. This is the biggest “ooo look at this made up story that coincides with my selfish beliefs” post I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. If you can, share a cab ride with the president, or one of his many aides I’m sure you support. Thanks</p>

        <p>I know plenty of them. Some are even family who worked on Covid patients.</p>
<p>They know this is bullshit and is killing hundreds of thousands more than the virus would from lack of medical care for basic things. Killing so many children in the 2nd and 3rd world, or even here, from missed vaccinations. Killing 75m+ at least in starvation. But it's okay, sit in your basement, Redditor.</p>

        <p>That's cute, but I am far too poor to have house with a basement. Nor do I hide in my home. I go do what i need to, avoid large crowds, am not opposed to wearing a mask. It really is not a big deal in my opinion. People have the right to stay home and avoid medical care as they see fit. People have a right not to use a service that asks customers to wear masks as they see fit. I really dont see an issue there. And i highly doubt theres a credible source for those numbers.</p>

        <p>I don't understand how we're still in a state of emergency. My state has 0-2 deaths a day. And you guessed it, most are from the nursing home (often hospice) What really baffles me is that still, too many, people are buying into this crap. Buisnesses are closing like crazy and  lots of people could care less about it. It really kills me watching the state that I love, die like this. We have a very fragile economy and it is going to take decades for it to recover.</p>

        <p>My local newspaper writes a nearly-daily article reporting zero new cases. How is this news? The neighboring County (where no one follows restrictions or wears masks) has had 13 people die, all in hospice care homes. I think after six months of this, we can conclude that the majority of people are safe from covid, but suffering from closures and we should focus on those most at risk (either from dying or losing everything).</p>

        <p>Friends and family is telling me that if they was me, they wouldn't go out hanging out with other friends and participate in recreational activities. They're extremely afraid of the virus. They're nagging about mask wearing and so on. I'm tired of the fear. I'm not the typical lockdown skeptic. First when I heard about the virus I thought it was just another flu. When my country had a lockdown I partly supported it for the first few months (March, April, May). But after that I wasn't so sure about it anymore and now we've come to September I'm for opening again. Not only school and work, but also restaurants, entertainments etc. I think the virus is real and bad, but I don't think it's worth gambling with people's well being or mental health long term. After all these months I think it's not sustainable anymore and doctors have become better at treating the virus. Yes, the virus may be worse than flu to some people - but it doesn't equal ebola. A lockdown lasting longer than it has now and it's benefits won't out weight the consequences. I'm not mostly worried about the economics, but I'm mostly worried about people's mental health, well being, the deadly affect of depression/anxiety etc. I think the lockdown will affect the privileged upper class negatively too, not only the poor, the disabled etc. It will affect everyone.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm for normal hand washing (after bathroom breaks, before/after eating etc.), staying at home when sick, coughing in the elbow etc. I still don't think all of the restriction is worth it. If commoners wears masks there would be a short supply for medical professional and most people use them wrong, so they're ineffective. Our commoners doesn't have the same training as medical professions does. In addition it makes communication more difficult for deaf, autistic and people with auditory processing disorders. Let's not forget claustrophobic, anxious and PTSD people. Yes, I'm wearing a mask to avoid getting in trouble. It doesn't mean I believe they're as effective. In the beginning I didn't know how ineffective they're, but now I've. Therefor I went from an OK-masker (not same as pro-mask. Pro-mask are for punishment by law, OK-masker for recommendation - but optional) to leaning slightly to anti-m (thinking they're ineffective and ableist).</p>
<p>It really frustrates me when people says "I hope you either dies or stay two weeks on the ventilator because of you couldn't handle the discomfort of a piece of cloth". None have said that in real life to me, but I've seen the memes online.</p>

And the best part is they think they will still be rich after shutting down the economy. Just keep kicking that can down the road...</p>

        <p>To be fair, they may also have more goods stocked up - food, water, medicine, ammo, toilet paper, etc - to pay for security. But in general, I agree. Many people like to say "only the rich will survive this" but that gives then way too much credit.</p>

        <p>Good to know I'm not the only one! The breaking point for me was when I went from normal hearing to not being able to understand what a word people says when wearing masks. Friends of me has pre-COVID19 times commented how great my hearing is. But perfect hearing doesn't help if I can't understand a shit. Maybe it's people mumbling, maybe it's my autism or maybe it's something else - I don't know. I doubt it's common to just go "deaf" overnight. At home I hears people normally.</p>
<p>I just became really upset and started doubting the whole thing after seeing the restrictions does more harm to the general population than the virus itself. I'm not saying the virus isn't bad. Restrictions just aren't the right way to go.</p>

        <p>Florida has dropped all restrictions I believe. I'd recommend waiting until an arbitrary date like November 3rd to determine whether this will last though. The Machiavellian games will be over by then, after that they will either get rid of trump and the bailouts to "save the economy" or be screwed because it was for nothing. God I hope they lose just as a payback for all the countless lives they have ruined.</p>

        <p>You know, I didn't think it would come to this, but... apparently the Virginia health commissioner has declared he will force vaccinations throughout the state.  I don't know how they plan to do that shit.  I don't go to public school.  I'm a grown man.  What, are they going to ask for your papers before they let you enter Walmart?  But my point is, unchecked executive authority is very, very dangerous.</p>

        <p>It isn't about whether or not someone supports vaccines. It's about MANDATORY vaccination. They are attempting to even dictate now what goes on inside our own bodies. This is about autonomy, liberty, and civil rights at this point - not about vaccines.</p>

        <p>I don't know if it's just all the stress from the months that's been manifesting that's coming out or what... But this has just been a shit week for me. I got in a heated conversation with my dad on Wednesday where I opened up to him about some serious feelings i've had since I was little... Long story so i'll save you the details, but it had to do with feeling inadequate and forgotten when compared to my mentally handicapped brother while growing up and being blatantly disrespected by some family members... And he just basically told me to get over it and tried to shame me for expressing how I felt. And i've been bitter about that conversation ever since.</p>
<p>Then earlier tonight the news was airing another doomer segment about how irresponsible university parties are... A few months ago the news in Canada had a moronic doctor on that spent his entire time on-camera boasting about how "there's blatant cultural differences between Canadians and Americans in response to this virus"... Basically in Layman's terms this doctor was saying Americans are morons and Canadians are super responsible... The usual biased bullshit that Canadian news spouts to make people feel prideful even if it's untrue. So on tonight's broadcast when they showed the university parties I sarcastically said "yeah look at those cultural differences at work" (alluding to that doctor) and my doomer American hating dad decided to go toe to toe with me and make excuses that "oh they're young idiots that's the difference". Man, he's really becoming such a stereotypical old curmudgeon as he gets into his senior ages it's depressing to see.</p>
<p>We ended up arguing for a minute and he as usual just dismissed me and everything I was saying... And now I just have this fuzz in my head and feel physically tired. Like, this week has just been shit and I think i'm just mentally exhausted... And there's no respite in sight since this pandemic bullshit is everywhere so I can't even escape anywhere to just be by myself and not surrounded by negativity and stress. I'm so over it. I just wish I could, like, teleport to some hot springs retreat in the mountains far away from everyone and just be by myself for a while with other like minded people. Because this doomer society bullshit and my dad's blatant idiocy is just draining the shit out of me. Fuck this year.</p>

        <p>Good points! I feel the same. I'm fed up with these restrictions and it's affecting my mental health negatively. This was supposed to be the year where I decided to forget problems I had earlier in my life, move on and have fun. Although good thing still happens in my life, it could be even greater if it wasn't for the COVID19 bs. Often I bottle up and doesn't express my honest opinions because of I don't want to deal with the pro-lockdown people. The majority of people I know are pro-lockdown and pro-mask. Even earlier anti-lockdown have become pro-lockdown. So, I think thumb up for you who've balls to confront your fams and friends.</p>

        <p>Yeah my dad is SUPER pro-lockdown and pro-mask and he's a total media puppet... So it's getting progressively harder and harder to bite my tongue around him since he's so far gone off the deep end. </p>
<p>I get you. I too was going to do some fun things this year. I was planning to sign up to be a background actor to finally do something interesting, gain on-camera experience and make some money. But nope, another year of sitting on the couch watching life go by. So lame.</p>

<p>"I can understand this suck. It's really boring for the young people, but it ain't over yet. We've to hold on till the vaccine comes"</p>
<p>"We don't know when the vaccine come. Maybe next summer? Hold on and hope for the best"</p>
<p>"Have you remembered wearing your mask?"</p>
<p>"Remember wearing you mask"</p>
<p>"You do wear mask, right?"</p>
<p>"You've to remember masking up" - said my 'former anti-lockdown' friend who've now changed his mind because of his gf.</p>
<p>FYI, I wear mask to avoid getting in trouble with people in society. That doesn't mean I think they're working. In the beginning I thought the COVID19 was just another flu, then I thought the lockdown was necessary for the three first month and then my skepticism started again. I've now started bringing with me pen and paper, so if a masked individual want to talk to me they better write things down because of I can't hear when people wears masks. Either they've to touch my pen/paper, bring some with them or not talk to me.</p>

        <p>Was out skateboarding and forgot to bring a drink. There’s a leisure centre next to the skate park so I tried to go in and buy one from the vending machine. There’s a masked staff member on the door who will not let me in to buy a drink from the machine. </p>
<p>What I wished I’d done is lie and say I was diabetic and in serious trouble if I didn’t get a sugary drink. I think I’d have heard a dial-up tone emanating from this woman’s head. </p>

        <p>Someone told me I belong on a terrorist watch list for "killing people" because I take issue with the increasing human population of 7 billion vs the decreasing shark population of 1 billion. They compared my belief that 1 million dead out of 7 billion is chump change - mind you, these are mostly deaths of those already dying, via harvesting effect - to supporting the Holocaust and nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Sorry, but those who died from COVID are only 0.01% to 0.02% of the human population, and many would've died next year from the flu, pneumococcal pneumonia, or a heart attack. Half a million sharks are 0.05% of their population. You want science? There's your fucking science. All this talk of "compassion" and "selfishness" is moral posturing, an emotional argument to compensate for a lack of understanding.</p>

<p>I honestly had to laugh when it came out that he got the coof because that means either A.  Further proof that all these draconian measures don't work for shit or B. He wasn't following his own rules forced upon us. I would not be so vile as to wish death upon him, but I would not shed a tear on the very slim chance he did kick the bucket .</p>
<p>I have read suggestions to talk with business owners and getting their viewpoints on this because I absolutely am ready to cut off any compliant morons at this point. Think you're going to go into next year still forcing people to wear masks? Too bad,guess Jeff Bezos is going to get a lot richer. May make grocery shopping a pain, but usually I put the thing on to get past any staff at the door the just let it hang while I'm inside.</p>
<p>I am quite glad for this sub and others like it because I know for sure that I am not alone in my thoughts about Covid and living in this hell has only increased my severe misanthropy. If only we could escape the inevitable consequences of the shutdown and point and laugh at the worthless sheep as they get what they deserve.</p>

        <p>I remember a few weeks ago, seeing a picture on another sub that showed one of the land crossings had a lot of traffic waiting to enter into the US. I think the pic was somewhere south of California, but not 100% sure which border crossing it was for sure. That picture made me think the total closure of the US/Mexico land border, may no longer be in effect. And that you could cross, even for nonessential/leisure travel. I'd google to figure out the fine print, but I'm starting to think that maybe nonessential/leisure travel might be possible for now, unlike what I worried (where it wasn't possible).</p>
<p>Note the land border closure is still in effect for US/Canada, sadly. I've heard some reports that if you take a flight into Canada(which btw you still can do, but flights only go into a few airports), that they require those going up there for leisure travel to self-quarantine for 2 weeks. Honestly, screw that.</p>

        <p>I just finished talking with another coworker who is an Engineer. These people are supposed to be smart, and I would think, logical. Nope. He believes the narrative, hook, line and sinker. He believes 'science'. This is the second one I've had a similar conversation with. I explained how someone who is told they're dying of cancer will be marked as Corona death if they catch the virus. He brushed it off. My province doesn't even have 300 deaths, yet he believes we have saved 10s of thousands due to the measures. He believes the virus is killing the economy, not government overreach. Fuck these people. I hope they get sick from the mandatory vax when it rears its ugly head.</p>

        <p>So I just found out that Broadway is closed until at least June of 2021. As a theatre student and a lover of musicals, this breaks my heart. I get so much joy watching and performing in live theater productions, it's one of the things that makes me truly happy. I don’t even know if my school is doing our spring production. If they cancel that or do some half ass "ViRtUaL" bullshit, I would be devastated. I don’t want to watch virtual theatre shows, I want to see it in person. I've always wanted to see Wicked on Broadway, but I don’t know if that'll ever happen because of the "nEw NoRmAl." Of course, all my friends are like "eww covid" and probably blaming people that don't wear masks and cower in their homes like sheep. I don’t understand this, it's so unfair. I've always wanted to be an actress, now I don't think I'll get to do that.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry. It always amazes me the amount of things that continue to be ruined so long after the virus was discovered.</p>
<p>I will never understand how people can call others selfish for being upset over the loss of "trivial" and "non-essential" things while demanding that everything that brings people happiness be destroyed. I see so many post where people are upset over others having parties, going on vacation, or just trying to do anything that's enjoyable at all, saying that if we had just stayed home (it's not that hard, don't you know /s), everything would be OK. Why can't they just stay home if it's so easy and leave those of us who are actually trying to work and live alone?</p>

        <p>Well, my area is officially enforcing tyranny again. We had a COMPLETELY EXPECTED slight spike from schools being back in session, so the government is panicking and closing down <em>everything</em> instead. As one would, right? So ridiculous.</p>
<p>And so far it's only in the big cities, but I know it'll only take a slight further surge for them to extend it everywhere else. So i'll be out of my gym again for a few months i'm sure.</p>
<p>And then I had to bite my tongue at hearing my doomer 'glued to the news' dad talk about how "they need to apply restrictions when the cases go up". Easy for you to say when all you do is work in your home office and watch the news. Ugh.</p>
<p>So done with this shit. So so so done. The biggest takeaway from this pandemic is going to be how stupid people are.</p>

        <p>Worldwide class action lawsuit</p>
<p>https://rense.com/general96/international-class-action-lawsuits-against-corona-pcr-test-manufacturers.php</p>
<p>https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=155716</p>
<p>AND THIS brings me to a video that I ran this week that went viral of German lawyer, Reiner Fuellmich who's been a member of the bar in both Germany and California for 26 years and who discusses the findings of the International Corona Investigative Committee that was formed on July 10, 2020 by lawyers, doctors, and scientists and who jointly reached the conclusion that COVID-19 may be the greatest crime against humanity in history.</p>
<p>Dr Fuellmich, who has successfully litigated against Deutsche Bank and Volkswagen lays out a legal case of Crimes Against Humanity for enforcing lockdowns based on the fraudulent use of PCR test results - which, as we just noted, do not prove the existence of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>He says, "As more and more independent studies and expert statements show, under the rules of Civil Tort law, all those who have been harmed by these PCR test-induced lockdowns are entitled to receive full compensation for their losses."</p>
<p>Due to the preponderance of evidence, the government will be held responsible for the damages it inflicted upon the population and the crimes committed by various health authorities and the WHO must be legally qualified as actual crimes against humanity, as defined in Section 7 of the International Criminal Code and he suggests that the path forward to compensatory damages and to political consequences is through the Class Action lawsuit.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the many, many US Federal and state laws that are being violated by these COVID actions on the part of local governments, such as Title 18 US Code §1038 about false information and hoaxes, where you go to prison if you provide false information or misleading information relating to biological hazards, with a maximum penalty of life in prison if these frauds result in death - which they have!</p>

        <p>TPTB, hell bent on the big reset, will stop at nothing to push forward the New World agenda. They'll look at this lawsuit sort of like Monsanto regarded the lawsuit against them. Sure they were sued, and had to pay up. But it was just a minor inconvenience. Roundup is still on the shelves,  and Monsanto continues to operate like nothing happened. I wish a class action lawsuit would work, but sadly have my doubts.</p>

        <p>My state COVID sub posted this link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305377</p>
<p>It's basically a study claiming that people who oppose lockdown rules don't have empathy, and of course the comments are having a ball with it.</p>
<p>Painting the other side as crazy so that no one is even allowed to entertain ideas not given my mainstream media. Propaganda at it's finest.</p>

        <p>FYI, this is the first weekly chat post that originates from /u/NoNewNormalBot.  This is an account that I set up specifically to auto-post the weekly chat thread.  It has moderator access for posts and flair in order to post the chat.  It exists so that it's got the OP designation rather than a human user so that, should anything happen to it with brigading or what have you, it affects a dedicated account rather than my real Reddit account.</p>
