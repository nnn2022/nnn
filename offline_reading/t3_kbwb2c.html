        <p>So what's the theory here? Masks work for the flu but not for covid? Doesn't seem likely to me. Could it be that children are the primary carriers of the flu and with schools shutdown it's spreading less? Any other ideas?</p>

        <p>No, they are testing for it if your CoVid-19 test does not come back positive and you do not have symptoms of CoVid-19.</p>
<p>The problem is with these inaccurate PCR tests, nearly everyone DOES come back positive.</p>

        <p>Well that's the thing, they never really did test for flu unless you were hospitalised or went to your GP unexpectedly and they were trying to rule out possible causes.</p>
<p>Even if you did test positive then there is not much they can really do other than hospital care and give antiviral drugs which may or may not be effective.</p>
<p>If you were old and knackered and probably going to die at some point in the near future anyway then they wouldn't even bother testing and just say it was viral pneumonia/hospital acquired pneumonia.</p>
<p>The average person who gets flu symptoms realises that they suddenly feel awful and if they are sensible will just stay at home for 4/5 days to recover until they start to feel a bit better without bothering to get tested.</p>
<p>But for Covid they are testing literally anything that moves regardless or whether someone has symptoms or not. It's ridiculous. </p>
<p>I honestly wonder what the results would be if they started testing millions of asymptomatic people for Influenza?</p>

        <p>Keep thinking, you may get there. If some symptomatic people are being refused tests this year, that would have been tested lats year, but the overall test count isn't that different, who are we testing now that we weren't testing last year?</p>
<p>Traditionally, we only test people who are sick. Now with covid, we test people who aren't sick, pretending pcr is a primary diagnostic tool. So if we're focusing on testing the wrong people, the pos% will change. That's certainly part of the change. Is it all of it? You don't know, because you don't know who they're testing. You reach conclusions that match your narrative because you think that's how science works.</p>
<p>If you don't have the data, you can't reach a conclusion. Now try asking why you don't have the data. See if that gets you somewhere.</p>

        <p>I've drawn no conclusion as to why the flu is less prevalent this year, but it seems illogical to assume that it is because we can't see it in the data. I don't think any of the experts think that its because its just as bad, we just aren't testing for it.</p>
<p>It's still possible it picks up significantly in the coming months, but based on what we have seen from the southern hemisphere's flu season it seems like it will likely just be way down this year. It may take us a long time to understand why, if we ever figure it out.</p>

        <p>We have completely reinvented disease diagnosis, counting, and reporting, skewing everything to covid. Cases had never before been diagnosed solely via pcr, antibody presence, nor "probably" having it as observed by a remote doctor listening to symptoms that could describe a dozen different maladies. We never counted deaths by this "caused, contributed to, or believed to have contributed to, even in the absence of an actual test" silliness as directed by the who and cdc.</p>
<p>To assume this intentional misinformation doesn't extend to other facets of medicine seems naive at best. Since the measures taken to control the spread of covid have had no success, the idea that they magically control the flu is absurd.</p>
<p>With such drastically different stats, the first assumption is bad data, not miraculous departure from baseline.</p>

        <p>Your assumption is that the measures didnt contain the spread. It seems clear it would have been far worse far faster if there had been no measures. Whether you agree that we should have taken any measures, its absurd to assume the virus was unimpeded by our measures taken.</p>

        <p>Look at Georgia. Florida. Sweden. Same spread, different measures. There are South American countries with far more or less stringent lockdowns that also didn't show the results you would need to justify it.</p>
<p>There is NO DATA to suggest these measures have any effect. None. Its why the big mask study got recalled, cold season happened and everyone got colds. Since every study prior to this year suggested respiratory viruses weren't controllable in this fashion, lockdowns nor masks were recommended, to assume all this was in error is your erroneous conclusion.</p>

        <p>And the numerous countries that brought community transmission to 0? They all beilieve they did it through lockdowns, are you suggesting they just got lucky?</p>
<p>There are so many factors, why different places with different measures might see similar spread, but frankly i have no idea how you compare florida, georgia and sweden. Even if their overall numbers were similar (they arent really, ohio and Illinois are more comparable) they have had different spikes at different times all year. Shocking that sweden was spiking and then imposed lockdown measures and now it isnt.</p>

        <p>Numerous?  One, I think, NZ.</p>
<p>And yes, if, again per CDC literature, you catch a disease fast enough, as determined by the rate at which is spreads and the porous nature of the borders, and lock down hard enough, you can stop it.  Covid was moving for ~5 months in the US and Europe before people tried to do anything.</p>
<p>Even then, you have millions of "essential workers" and their dependent care to worry about so you can live your life at home with delivered food and packages.  If they're all still moving around, colds still spread.</p>
<p>Again, there is no historic data that a widespread cold can be impacted by a lockdown, and no evidence that anything but seasonal affects are at play here.  Seasons vary with latitude.  You also need to watch the actual timing of lockdowns vs transmission.  Much of Europe has a habit of locking down right as the virus is already peaking.  Given the 1-2 week lag in case detection, a lockdown that shows results too quickly isn't what is responsible for limiting the spread.  Read up on herd effects, much data here.</p>
<p>You'll also have very poor luck comparing "overall numbers" from state to state or country to country. The data quality and disparities in reporting are so poor that even an order of magnitude comparison is challenging at best.  covidtrackingproject has some guidelines on how different US states are reporting, how they are handling duplicates, hiding negative tests, combining antibody tests with pcr, etc.  Unless you make some attempt to clean that data, all you can look at are seasonal trends, and the trend is, when cold season hits (see historical data) colds go up.</p>

        <p>China, thailand, vietnam (possibly cambodia and laos though im skeptical), taiwan, more recently singapore has now gone several weeks without local transmission after a heavy lockdown. </p>
<p>Im in thailand and they are starting to have a leak through the pourous border with myanmar, but we have basically been virus free since late april. Lockdown started around the end of march, started reopening in june after a full month of 0 local transmission.</p>
<p>The key seems to be that the purpose of the lockdown must be eradication. Flattening the curve is/was always a stupid goal. At this point though with vaccines deploying almost noone should bother with lockdowns anymore.</p>

        <p>China let it leak out every port in to other countries, but also contained it to one region.  Trusting China's data on this is iffy at best.</p>
<p>Case numbers on worldometer for Thailand and Taiwan (didn't bother with the rest) never stayed at 0 for more than a few days, and now are going back up.  So, you still have vulnerable populations with no immunities and can't afford to reopen borders!  Months and months locked down in some of these countries where only the smallest, most remote, most easily isolated ever had a prayer of reducing it to 0 internally, and they still can't be exposed to the outside world because they are without protection.</p>
<p>Eradication is a joke unless you intend to isolate forever.  New cold and flu strains pop up from time to time, and most end up endemic, because eradication simply isn't possible, and once they make the rounds of the severely compromised, they're not that serious any more.</p>
<p>You simply lack an understanding of the biology involved here, the ease in which these things spread, and the compassion for those impacted by these insane lockdowns, to think this route is in any way effective or superior to allowing the milder of these diseases to run their courses while protecting those who are sick as best we can, knowing some who are in nursing homes are going to succumb to nearly anything that comes along, covid or another cold, a flu, pneumonia, whatever, and that's okay.  At least they can do so with caring family at their side.  Crippling and starving populations, depriving children, giving governments authoritarian powers in line with, well, china and nazi germany in order to fight this is nothing but ignorance of the repercussions.</p>

        <p>Worldometers includes, as do all of these countries in their numbers, people repatriating on flights that are sent into quarantine for two weeks immediately upon arrival. They aren't like trump afraid that those numbers will make them look bad to be included. </p>
<p>I have friends in china, both here and there have been enjoying being back to pretty much normal for most of the year. Vietnam enjoyed about 100 days virus free then had a fresh outbreak and contained it a second time.</p>
<p>My only point was the lockdowns definitely can curb the virus. You are right that it isn't necessarily the best strategy, all these countries have been self isolated for the most part nearly all year, but time will tell which strategy had more drastic effects on the economy. </p>
<p>Overall it's just about over though, this conversation is pretty much over because vaccines are now being deployed across the world. Hopefully they target the most vulnerable the soonest so we can start not having our hospitals full of old dying people, but I'm not optimistic for the US at least. </p>
<p>I have a friend who is a senior financial analyst who has been deemed "an essential worker" first in line for the vaccine. Like wtf lol</p>

        <p>Thats not quite right according to the CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm</p>
<p>As you will see, those with Alzheimer and dementia see a large uptick (the elderly), those with certain heart conditions and those with diabetes (obese) are dying at a greater rate.</p>
<p>More people are dying than usual. The data I share does not support your statement. Do you have a source to back your statement that I could review?</p>
<p>However, I did run the numbers specifically for CA. The total excess death count will be around 33k for the year for CA. So, for a 0.0835% (that's not 8%, thats 0.08%) increase in expected deaths, we have nuked our economy and society. Madness.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask subdued a population?</p>
<p>I would have figured it was more of a marginal cost/benefit decision as far as "its cheap and accessible, and even though it won't do alot of good, it will help a tiny bit". Essentially, let the people deal with it so leadership does not have to pay to protect the masses but make them feel safer. Because there was a time in the past that the virus was unknown. We did not know for certain what it was and what it would do. We do now, but back in Feb/Mar we did not.</p>
<p>Then couple that with the idea of busy work. That is, give people the illusion of safety and DOING something for that "safety".</p>
<p>All of that sounds far more probable than some kind of great reset.</p>

        <p>I guess the first test they run is the PCR on SARS-Cov-2.</p>
<p>First of all, the inventor of this test said you can't use it to diagnose people. Our government actually acknowledged that, but still uses it to count "infections" because it's the "worldwide golden standard". The peer review to use the test for checking on SARS-CoV-2 was finished 2 days after the first paper on it was released. Very suspicious. </p>
<p>Secondly SARS-CoV-2 hasn't been isolated even today. So how can they test on it, if they haven't even proven this virus exists and haven't got it's real RNA sequence?</p>
<p>But anyway, I guess after they ran this unscientific test, which they now only run looking for 1 instead of 3 targets like they did before, and upped the limit Ct value from 30 to 35, and if it turns out positive, they won't bother checking for flu anymore and just say you have SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>"16,396 tests for influenza were performed at reporting laboratories, which is 2.6 times the average for this week over the past six seasons (Figure 3a). The percentage of tests positive for influenza in week 49 was 0.04%, compared to 13.0% during the past six seasons (Figure 3b)."</p>
<p>But we do like 40k tests per day for COVID19 in Ontario alone. Probably over 700k COVID tests per week across all of canada.</p>
<p>"In week 49, seven laboratory detections of influenza were reported." That's 7 cases after testing 16000 people. https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/fluwatch/2020-2021/week-49-november-29-december-5-2020.html</p>

        <p>The 496 flu cases from this year compared to the over 15,000 last year means flu activity has fallen by 97%</p>
<p>It i important to note that every year, far more people contract the influenza virus than are confirmed to have it by the CDC. For the 2019-2020 season, even though the CDC had confirmed just over 15,000 cases of the flu by Week 49, it had also estimated “1.7 million flu illnesses, 16,000 hospitalizations, and 910 flu-related deaths” by the same point in early December 2019.</p>
<p>According to the report, so far for the 2020-2021 flu season, only 496 people have tested positive for the influenza virus since September 27, 2020. That number is out of the 232,452 cumulative tests which have been performed, leaving the current percent of tests that come back positive at only 0.2%.</p>
<p>In the Southern Hemisphere, April through July constitutes the peak flu season for the countries in that half of the globe. According to NBC News, “Data from Australia, Chile and South Africa shows a tiny fraction of influenza cases from April to July… In those three regions, there were just 51 influenza positive specimens among 83,307 tests for a positivity rate of 0.06 percent.”
“In contrast, the positive rate in those regions during the same time period in years prior was close to 14 percent,” NBC News reports.</p>

        <p>It's because they don't care.  I've heard that from doctors, basically the treatment is the same based on the symptoms regardless if the test comes back positive.  The test is a waste of money.</p>

        <p>Every year past they've run hundreds of thousands of tests, and would do so upon request. It was popular among my friends after the pax with swine (I think) flu outbreak. Everyone got tested to know if they had that one instead of other flus. No, I don't know why.  They even tested my wife for flu which she was really sick last December. </p>
<p>But now people are having those requests actively refused. This does appear to be a distinct departure.</p>

        <p>I saw this at r/Coronavirus.</p>
<p>My god... What I saw at there made me loose faith in humanity once more. </p>
<p>Some people want restrictions to stay after covid forever wow!</p>
<p>Some suggested to mask animals.</p>
<p>How about Sweden didn't have masks and lockdowns? Why aren't all dead? Total deaths this year still in the media than the last 10 years. Please some one explain.</p>
<p>There's a pandemic and apparently this year it was the least people getting sick. Interesting</p>
<p>Some people suggested that there is no flu because of masks and lockdown, but Sweden didn't have any of that and they also didn't have the flu.</p>
<p>So... Many people are saying that they didn't get sick this year, could that be attributed also to the air being much more clean than previous years? North Italy is one of the worst places for respiratorie diseases and it is due air pollution. </p>
<p>Some people showed common sense proposing that Covid is actually the flu, it does make sense since the numbers correspond, and the PCR test depending on the number of cycles could give positive to any respiratorie illness even if is months old. </p>
<p>What it does supriced me the most is that I didn't seem to find anyone that mentions the "Scientific" reason of why there's no flu and that's that Covid killed the flu, they both need a host and they fought for the host and Covid won... </p>

        <p>There probably <em>are</em> plenty of flu cases.  They either have yet to be counted or are being severely under-reported due to lack of testing.  I can't imagine medical professionals are prioritizing flu case counts right now.  I do note that the <em>death counts</em> attributed to flu, "with or without COVID or pneumonia" for 2020 number 6,877 currently (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">source</a>).  So, we've definitely seen more than 496 cases.  Let's not look for a conspiracy here; I don't believe you'll find one other than the possible prioritization of COVID testing over flu.  </p>
<p>Personally, I would avoid articles in "Focus on the Family", as it's a fundie Christian publication rife with heavy biases.</p>

        <p>&rt;I know what flu season is, dumbass. You don't need to give a source. Flu season is at it's absolute peak in February. The CDC doesn't start reporting flu cases instantly, just like how we don't have final case/death counts for COVID-19 yet.</p>

        <p>I agree with you that there will likely be far more flu cases reported....assuming they continue to test diligently for the flu.  I am simply disagreeing with you over your assertion that we aren't in flu season yet.  Even if February is the peak, flu season begins in the fall, typcially, in the US.</p>
