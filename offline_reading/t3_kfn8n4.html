    <strong>Third UK lockdown inevitable</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/will-there-be-third-lockdown-coronavirus-downing-street-b355716.html">Downing Street refuses to rule out third lockdown in England as London covid cases soar | Evening Standard</a></p>
<p>People complied with the first lockdown. It seemed like a temporary, reasonable response to a crisis that Boris - a lifelong libertarian - was gutted at having to take. Then came the betrayal of the 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme and all kinds of arbitrary, pro-corporate, rules-for-thee hypocrisy. No-one followed the second lockdown.</p>
<p>Then came the 'tiers' (a.k.a. bespoke lockdowns). No-one can tell you what the tier restrictions are, but they can tell you which shops are ignoring them! Now there's this: a third lockdown. They will do it as the furlough money is already penciled in, so the denials are just theatre. But no-one will care.</p></p>

        <p>This will do nothing. Much like the last one all itâ€™ll do is make the economy worse and cause more unemployment and closed businesses</p>

        <p>I believe this is the actual reason case numbers are rising now (apart from testing more): Many people have realised it's just security theatre, and they pay lip service to it while flaunting the regulations as soon nobody's watching.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, governments are desperate to get the spread under control, not to save lives, but to save their own political hides. Because if the virus manages to spread far enough that we attain herd immunity before the vaccine rolls out, then people will realise it's all rubbish, and the lockdowns and the vaccine weren't even necessary.</p>
