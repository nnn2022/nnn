        <p>Yes. It's not just one or two things. You surround someone in a blanket and essentially have that blanket threaten to smoother them if they don't embrace it.</p>
<p>The whole goal is to make people feel "cozy" about their decisions. Once they're committed to an ideology that makes them feel like the good guy, they'll shut out anything that says otherwise.</p>

        <p>I can speak from someone who was swept away in all this.</p>
<p>It was Trump.</p>
<p>Initially, I was indifferent, but I slowly started to get under the impression he was bad. Then anything he said was bad. Anything he did was bad.</p>
<p>So when he went counter to the media, I took the media's side. It wasn't a huge aspect in my life, just thought everyone thought he was an idiot and went about my day. Didn't think anything of it. Never looked into it.</p>
<p>It wasn't until earlier this year that personal events lead me to question things. When I got incredibly harsh feedback from lefty friends and reddit for questioning things, I started to see I was on the wrong side. </p>
<p>The truth- the right side of history- doesn't need censorship. </p>
<p>Some people just want to live their lives and don't care. They're indifferent. I was like that. They want life to just go on and don't care about how. </p>
<p>I am now radicalized. I intend to do bursts of activism I never thought myself capable of.</p>
<p>It truly was like waking up. I started caring about things because I actually cared, not because I was told to care.</p>
