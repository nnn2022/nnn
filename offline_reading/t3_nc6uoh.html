    <strong>Wait, are these new CDC mask guidelines really a good thing?</strong>
    <p><p>States might have eventually just lifted mask mandates for everyone but now with these new guidelines it gives them permission to “segregate” vaccinated and not vaccinated, to have someone checking peoples vaccinated status at certain public places, and keeping kids masked indefinitely since it will be a while before they get vaccinated </p>
<p>We may have just traded one villain for another</p></p>

        <p>Nah imo a lot of people like us will openly not mask and don't care, and eventually they'll going to be start asking, "if you are vaccinated or not."  And somehow I can bet you, there will be so much confusion that they'll pull back these stupid "guidelines" they made and make the vaccine passport mandatory as to differentiate people regarding who's vaccinated and who's not. Thus achieving their goal for more control.</p>
<p>Everyone must remember CDC doesn't give a F about any of us. This is all about control and it's a old petty game they are playing.</p>

        <p>This new mask guidelines were a terrible thing. Mask mandates were about to be lifted for everybody (both vaccinated and unvaccinated) in all states. Once freaking Gavin Newsom lifted his mask mandate, other Democratic governors would be left with no choice but to follow him.</p>
<p>This new CDC guidance were made in order to ensure that mask guidelines weren't lifted for unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>See this thread, as well as an identical thread I created on Lockdown Critical Left.</p>

        <p>I definitely think this is not a clean win for us. They knew what they were doing by issuing this guidance without answering the obvious question of how to deal with unvaccinated people. I think this will increase the demand for and acceptance of vaccine passports by the vaccinated people who are terrified despite being vaccinated and the businesses who may listen to those scared voices and try to appease them. In many parts of the country, those voices are loudest.</p>
