    <strong>Something that I've found interesting re: vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>New to this sub! I've been lurking for some time but decided to join because I wanted to share something from my personal experience that I've found really interesting in the past couple of months.</p>
<p>Some background: I'm in my late 20s, pregnant with my first baby and in good health. I live in a blue state that has been pretty restrictive with lockdowns. I became eligible for the vaccine in...late March, I think?</p>
<p>Since I'm nearing the end of my pregnancy, I've had more frequent doctor appointments - I believe I've had 3-4 since becoming eligible for the vaccine, and each time I've met with a different provider in my OB's office (this is common practice for them as they want you to be comfortable with all of the doctors and because they're so busy with appointments right now). </p>
<p>I kind of figured once the vaccine opened up to my demographic, I would get asked about it at every appointment - have you gotten your COVID vaccine, are you planning on getting your COVID vaccine, etc. </p>
<p><strong><em>So far, not a single provider has brought up the vaccine to me or suggested I get it.</em></strong> </p>
<p>I've had friends and family members ask me if I've gotten it or if I plan to get it, but not a single MEDICAL PROVIDER has asked me about it or encouraged me to get it. </p>
<p>It just makes me wonder, if the vaccines are SoOooO safe (and believe me, I've seen the articles and social media posts and everything else about how "safe" they are in pregnancy and for breastfeeding mothers), why aren't any of my doctors telling me to get it?</p>
<p>Idk. Maybe that's not that interesting, but it's just a thought that's been circling around in my head for a bit and I'm wondering what others thoughts are or if anyone else has had a similar experience?</p></p>

        <p>I'm being treated for infertility right now, in and out of appointments/blood tests/ultrasounds and so far, no one who has treated me has brought it up either. I'm pleasantly surprised so far but hopefully I will be mentally prepared for it when it does happen.</p>

        <p>I'm glad you doctors aren't pushing it onto you.  At the least if you are almost done with your pregnancy and have survived covid thus far, you're probably good for the last month or so.</p>
<p>Even in general so many medicines are warned of during pregnancy, and your body is already in a weird place for deciding to let another person grow in you.  Might as well just let it focus on that and mitigate your risks in other way.</p>

        <p>Completely agree that if I haven't gotten the virus in the last year+, I'll probably be set for the next few weeks. Even if I got the vaccine and the worst side effect was a fever (which is fairly common, from what I understand), that's not something that I really want to put my body and my baby through if I don't absolutely need to.</p>

        <p>The recommendation from ACOG is that the vaccines shouldn't be withheld from pregnant women that want them, which is notably different language from recommending it.  I'm glad they aren't pushing it on you.</p>
<p>The ACOG also says:
<em>Pregnant patients who decline vaccination should be supported in their decision. Regardless of their decision to receive or not receive the vaccine, these conversations provide an opportunity to remind patients about the importance of other prevention measures such as hand washing, physical distancing, and wearing a mask</em></p>

        <p>I actually just asked the other day about masking because I literally cannot imagine laboring in a mask. </p>
<p>Where I‚Äôm delivering, they‚Äôll COVID test me when I come into deliver and not require a mask during labor. The doctor I spoke with said some people wear them after labor depending on who‚Äôs in and out of the room, but they don‚Äôt require them. I was very relieved.</p>
