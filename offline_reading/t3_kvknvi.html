    <strong>Here's how I protest</strong>
    <p><p>Just wanted to get this out there in the hopes that it catches on. I know it's not much, but to me preventing my body and mind from becoming soft and squishy is a small act of rebellion against the powers that be that would rather we sit on our asses and consume Netflix/products all day. </p>
<p>Go for jogs a few times a week. Eat real food. I'm talking unprocessed meat, fresh vegetables, nothing frozen unless it's also unprocessed. Read books ffs, get in touch with your spirituality and human psychology. Find some set of moral principles and make that your religion, even if it isn't one. Help people out, even if they don't necessarily follow your set of ideals. Get a VPN, they're cheap. Use a browser that doesn't collect your data. Browse social media from within that browser. Grow a garden if you can. Give people shit from that garden if you have extra. Be accepting, remember that you can disagree idealogically with someone and still be their friend. </p>
<p>That's how we dig ourselves out of this disaster. If enough people just revert back to a more wholesome existence, we win. Plain and simple. When you go for your runs or hit the gym or whatever, when you opt for chicken thighs and broccoli instead of Papa John's, take pride in the fact that they want you fat, flabby and stupid, but you're not having none of that.</p></p>

        <p>Yes this. I recently even found an in-person ‚Äúhippy‚Äù (thats what my husband calls it) school for my daughter. She learns core subjects, but also gets her hands dirty in the garden, takes care of animals twice a week, learns about hydroponics, art, fun but wholesome things that  actually mean something. It‚Äôs been great.</p>

        <p>Yes. Its been abundantly clear to me recently how the kids do truly get indoctrinated. My kids had about 6 weeks of hybrid school this year. They would literally put their masks on in the car on the way to school. </p>
<p>I started to see that they are taught to behave. To respect authority. To memorize. To fall in line. And, while my daughter still has to mask at her ‚Äúhippy‚Äù school...it‚Äôs much different. It‚Äôs more about learning to think for yourself, think outside the box, be creative. </p>
<p>I will say that it‚Äôs an expensive private school. I never would be able to afford it. BUT I randomly met a woman who told me about all of the scholarships and financial aid available. Just want to throw that out there for anyone reading. Definitely worth a try. There is more funding out there then we realize. Just have to look. </p>
<p>And if you don‚Äôt know where to look, try to find connections who do. There are people who know the tricks and tips. It‚Äôs really helpful.</p>

        <p>This is pristine advice. This entire time not a single "TV Doctor" in the media championed anything for our immune systems, being healthy etc.</p>
<p>You are now considered either Symptomatic or Asymptomatic according to them.</p>
<p>Most Covid patients have a lack of Vitamin D, coincidentally, you can get most of that from the sun. You can't get very much if you're LOCKED DOWN. it's almost like they did it on purpose eh?</p>
<p>I personally do Keto, but I'm not a "Keto Vegan" where I tell everyone I'm "doing keto" every 5 minutes. High Fat, High Protein, your body burns fat instead of carbs when you're in Ketosis. The weight melts off your body.</p>

        <p>Excellent. It's a meme at this point but we can 100% come out of this as stronger people. Nothing special but here are some of the habits I've cultivated. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I get free ebooks from my library's app. I suggest Understanding Media by Marshall McLuhan. He talks about how "the medium is the message" and other concepts that'll really make sense of our current media situation, even though the book is from the 60s. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stretching for obvious reasons due to our new couch locked lives, but also to explore where the anger and tension is stored in the body. Check out the book "The Body Keeps Score" for more info. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always keeping in mind how social media is affecting the mood. It works on many subconscious levels and it can take a while to noticed the brain being washed.    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminate alcohol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get a spreadsheet going or a budget app and really dig in to where your money is going and where you're headed. I know it doesn't sound fun but it'll change your life. Read the book "Total Money Makeover", it changed my life forever. Nobody wants to hear this but you can start to pay off debt and save and build much, much more savings than you ever thought possible. Even if you're unemployed it's important to learn these skills. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're a dude begin to cultivate and solidify in your life what it means to be a good man, check out the book, "The Way of the Superior Man", it's extremely corny in some parts but some of the main concepts are helpful. We are a generation of men raised by women, we've forgotten or never seen how to express our masculine side. It's an art, and there are different stages of growth  -  maybe started as an out of control jerk, to overcompensating and becoming a nice guy pushover, to finally learning to balance all that energy!</p>
</li>

        <p>Hell yeah. I‚Äôve been about 90% consistent in terms of diet (vertical diet by Stan Efferding) and exercise (weight training) for about 3 months now. My rationale is ‚Äúbuy low.‚Äù Everyone else is out here moping ‚Äúwaaa I was gonna do x, y, z...but then the pandemic blah blah‚Äù shut up. Excuses...all of them! The market for level headed, able bodied, employed young men is at an all time low and it‚Äôs your time to capitalize!</p>

        <p>Love Stan Efferdings work, I've been a long time Ray Peat fan but found most people's dietary advice based on his recommendations too dogmatic and out of alignment with my fitness training goals. The Vertical diet is one of the best diets I've ever done.</p>

        <p>Yep. This is where I'm at. Using positive affirmations/mantras.  Checking myself for time waste. Seeking meaningful non covid conversation, refusing the narrative and rejecting social media programming. Focusing on my skill building. Preparing my worst case scenario emergency stash. This is how we continue flourishing, rather than diminishing from all the restrictions, influence and societal disparity we see around us.</p>

        <p>Absolutely this is the best way to protest.  I highly recommend finding local farmers to get all your meat.  It's a great way to build community and get fresh locally sourced meat that is extremely nutritious.  Same thing for fruits and veggies when possible.  Local farming is under attack and it's on the list of things TPTB want to eradicate.  </p>
<p>I also recommend the book "Perfect Health Diet."  It's an excellent book that speaks to what our diet should ideally look like and why it should be that way with tons of testimonials and evidence.  It examines what our Paleoithic ancestors consumed and why their diet is still optimal for today.  It also goes into fasting and a lot of the ideas and science of its importance.  This way you're killing two birds with one stone by reading and working on a good diet.</p>
<p>Many of us are aware that the modern, western diet is a vector for disease and poor health.  Empty carbohydrates with little nutrition that just make you feel hungry always and pack on the pounds.  Obviously, a poor diet results in a higher chance of contracting viruses and a higher chance of having more severe symptoms.  If we can live our lives without fear and maintain community, we can lead by example to show that health isn't determined by doctors, vaccines, pharma, and big agriculture.  It is controlled by the individual.</p>
