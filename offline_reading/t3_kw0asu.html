    <strong>Realization on covid injection.</strong>
    <p><p>There's a lot that doesn't make sense right now and I think I pieced something together about how this treatment won't be effective.
Let's say I get their injection and I catch SARS cov 2.
My body will have reduced symptoms, let's say I have a headache and a runny nose. What are the chances that I have no idea I'm infected because symptoms are not severe or non existing, won't I just spread it even more because I'm oblivious to the situation?
Also let's say I do have symptoms that alarm me, well currently people are told to stay at home in that case. Therefore I would quarantine myself and not spread the illness, I'm speaking in regards to treated and untreated individuals here.
If we mask all the symptoms with this injection those people will have no idea if they are spreading this virus.</p></p>

        <p>This is why I cant for the life of me understand why they want to vaccinated healthcare workers first. 
Surely theyre going to go around with a false sense of security, with reduced symptoms if infected. Then going around the vulnerable for other things and just spreading the virus unknowingly.</p>

        <p>Honestly... I think they did this for two reasons.  One so that healthcare workers can stay at work and call off less.  Two because those workers would protest if we gave it out to random Joe off the street first.</p>

        <p>Maybe the overall idea is to get everyone infected. They have concluded little to no asymptomatic transfer, so maybe the only way for them to get the transfer is by having the vaccinated get everyone else sick. Not to mention the side effects of the "vaccine" seem to happen with more frequency than Covid actually having serious complications in younger people as well. Maybe they truly want the reset, the depopulation.</p>

        <p>Overall, the risk of asymptomatic transmission is pretty low (somewhere in the 1/200 - 1/325 contacts, depending on the study). Not nonexistent, but it's not that big of a risk.</p>

        <p>You are correct in saying that the Covid-19 vaccine will lessen your symptoms of the disease and hopefully stop you from being hospitalized. But it's possible that you could still carry the virus and be contagious to others. There has not been enough testing by the companies to know if the shedding of the virus is less with the vaccine or not.. So those who get the vaccine should still be wearing masks and practicing physical distancing according to the manufacturers and CDC guidelines (US here).</p>
<p>This is why it is so important for the vaccine to be given to those who truly need this protection of "lessened symptoms" such as the elderly.  It is also being rolled out to those frontline workers who are interested so that they can stay employed the entire time without being all that sick.  As with most new viruses over the years (think especially of those causing a pandemic) it takes time for the virus to become part of daily life without being a big deal.  The vaccination is part of this but so is herd immunity which unfortunately just takes times and means most of us will have to get the disease at least once in order to finally make this go away.</p>

        <p>I’m fine with all of that as long as ALL of the restrictions, especially Masks, go away for good. And soon. No pretending it is taking years. It only took 18 months for the spanish flu to be done, and that’s without a vaccine.</p>

        <p>I don't even care about the masks.  Putting some piece of paper or cloth on my face really doesn't effect my day all that much.  Honest its about as restrictive as having to wear sneakers because it's winter.</p>
<p>But everything being shut down, trying to homeschool my kids while working fulltime, watching all these small town businesses close their doors for good or going through hell at work due to government guidelines I could do without.  And I'm one of the lucky people who has had steady employment.  I can't even imagine being on the other side of things and losing a job and then sitting at home for 10 months.</p>
<p>I understood the initial shutdown.  Let's shut the country down for two weeks and let the hospitals prepare.  I don't think it was necessary but I at least understood that we didn't know what else to do.  So okay... two weeks and the hospitals converted rooms and were prepared for influx.  At this time they should have started training staff to take care of these patients (like hiring aids).  And then.... things just never really reopened... ever.  Don't get me wrong, I work in healthcare.  I understand basic virology and I'm not someone who things this doesn't exist but what the hell are we doing?  Honestly.</p>

        <p>Absolutely agree with you so much. Especially about the initial two weeks. </p>
<p>The reason masks bother me so much is because I cannot see smiles or facial expressions anymore, that disturbs me greatly, people appear not human at all to me, and I’ve noticed that those who wear masks avoid eye contact. Also I have a slight hearing loss in one ear and understand people better if I can lip read. I can’t understand anyone who’s wearing a mask unless they shout at me.</p>

        <p>&rt; low symptoms, wouldn't I spread it unknowingly</p>
<p>Yes! This is a valid concern. Until we have vaccinated everybody, those who are vaccinated yet can still be carriers may spread it unknowingly. That's why people should continue to wear masks while the vaccinations happen. Once everyone is vaccinated, no one will have to wear masks anymore.</p>

Not everyone is going to take the injection. It's not even recommended that everyone take it. 
You honestly think mask mandates will disappear after they reach their planned threshold?</p>

<p>Yes, but as you note, not everyone is willing to get the vaccine. I guess we could end up in a situation where not enough people get it and we end up having to put up with wearing masks and social distancing for a long time. :( That would suck.</p>

<p>I'm not sure where you got this figure, but as of October 2020, only 10% of the world's population had contracted COVID:</p>
<p>https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/health/who-coronavirus-world-population-intl/index.html</p>
<p>That isn't a majority.</p>
<p>If you're instead referring to the idea of people having antibodies after contracting COVID, the idea being that the majority of those who've contracted COVID so far have this immunity, this is false. Contracting COVID doesn't provide immunity:</p>
<p>https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19</p>
<p>&rt;There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.</p>
