        <p>They are two island countries essentially living under a giant dome.  The rest of the world either can’t have a dome because our economies don’t exist in a single nation vaccuum or are not  willing to do what it takes to have a dome (eg. stop citizens from travelling).  The only way for the rest of the world to live like they are living in Aus/NZ  is to let the virus burn through everything and accept the consequences.   People who think there won’t be consequences don’t understand that the 99.9% survival rate is when we have access to doctors.  It’s 95% survival without doctors which is the whole problem.  </p>
<p>We either have to accept the 5% death rate to live free if our hospitals can’t handle the surge or we have to deal with the hardship of keeping death to .1%.  That’s what we have been faced with. </p>
<p>Cue arguments that the death rate isn’t 5% without proper healthcare...</p>

        <p>The 5% death rate due to no access to doctors sounds like a bigger problem for developing countries than developed ones. There’s no reason for America to remain shut down because the virus could decimate the population of Iran or Venezuela</p>

        <p>Maybe America could treat everyone who needed hospital Covid intervention by implementing field hospitals in stadiums like in the movies. But who is staffing the extra beds? I could see success if it was  just a surge in one city and all resources go there.   That’s not what this is though.  This would be all cities and towns needing more hospital beds than the current system currently has at the same time.  This would be deciding who lives and dies at the door to the hospital including car accidents and heart attacks and things that have nothing to do with Covid. </p>
<p>If all restrictions are relaxed we would certainly find out how well it would go pretty damn fast. </p>
<p>So if you want that to happen you are betting on the hospitals not getting overwhelmed.  It would be great if you are right.</p>

        <p>My understanding is that staffing is the big reason we never went around building field hospitals to deal with the pandemic. You can’t train doctors and nurses overnight.</p>

        <p>It isn't 5% without proper healthcare.</p>
<p>REmember: 99.8%+ survival rate and MOST (99.5%+) people with CoVid-19 are NOT going to hospitals, NOT seeing doctors, etc.</p>
<p>Basically doctors are worthless with CoVid-19 because they keep on putting you on ventilators even though 8.5 out of 10 people with CoVId-19 who are put on ventilators D I E ! Compared that to 8.5 out of 10 people with CoVid-19 in hospitals SURVIVING when ventilators are not used.</p>

        <p>This isn’t going to go on forever.  In 6 months from now people who want to be vaccinated in developed countries will hopefully have had access to get vaccinated and that should change the situation.  Or maybe not many people will want to get vaccinated.  There could be a variant that burns through regardless of what we do and that will change things. I don’t propose anything around what percentage of death of infected people is good enough to remove all restrictions.  I am just watching the world around me and taking each day as it comes.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately here in Melbourne, Australia, things aren’t remotely back to normal. About 99.99999% of people still wear masks everywhere, small business have gone bankrupt and still are, small to large businesses are suffering because we get everything from overseas so even the small businesses that are open like mine are still suffering, restrictions are in place everywhere and the large businesses are absolute nazis when it comes to restrictions, our constitution states that travel from state to state is absolutely free and in no way can be restricted yet our government has hard locked the state borders. I could go on but I promise you that it is a total sh*tshow here</p>

        <p>I couldn’t care less. If Everyone stayed out of everyone’s business, there’d be no problems. 
And as far as masks go, if people want to wear one, it’s because they genuinely believe they work so how could I possibly infect them if they have one on? You know, it’s common sense. And I agree with you.... the second we take choice away from someone is the second they become a slave and not a person</p>

        <p>They barely protect other people either. It sounds pretty basic but look up videos of people vaping through masks and you can see where all their breath goes. It goes everywhere! It’s sort of like the principle of the path of least resistance.... if your breath can’t go forward, it blasts out all around the sides because it’s the path of least resistance.</p>

        <p>Well yeah, they aren't 100% effective either way, but I believe the principle is that they stop the relatively larger water droplets exhaled by people, that are the actual carriers of the virus particles.</p>

        <p>I’m fucking over the world praising how Australia is back to normal and praising how well we’ve done. I’m a bloody Aussie through and through and I’m disgusted with how much this country has turned to shit! We’re so far from normal here in Melbourne that I’ve told my sister not to move here from NSW because of the shit show going on here</p>

        <p>Someone downvoted you already. How funny. I see this shit when people go against the "narratives" the idiots here have woven like "AUS is back to normal" and "All the Italians are protesting now" even in spite of people from those countries claiming the contrary. This place is becoming just as much of a hive of misinformation and sensationalism as other subs. It's a shame, really.</p>

        <p>Slight misinformation - yes. But to a degree. A lot of the misinformation MAY be from new users coming to our side of the fence and are still learning. And a fair few comments seem like misinformation but like the above “if Australia and New Zealand can get back to normal...” I’ll give it the benefit of the doubt because we hear it all the time in the media and at a glance it doesn’t seem to be a sinister motive stating it... but.... my thinking is that the media is sensationalising our lockdowns here in Australia and across the water in New Zealand so the politicians can hard lockdown their own countries and say “hey, it worked for the Aussies”. The biggest issue in this sub is when it fades away from legitimate factual scientific and medical research articles, statistics, expert videos etc into the realm of opinions and discussions formed by each person in a way it seems they’re stating facts and truth when in fact they are just opinions. Things are already hard to decipher as to what’s real, conspiracy or media hype so yeah, the sub is straying into what appears to be misinformation and sensationalism based on the way people comment. Sorry if I repeated or rambled.... it’s 1am here and I just did a big work week</p>

<p>If the regulars on here still trust the media on matters like Australia being back to 100% normal, then they are idiots, plain and simple. Sorry, guys, it's the hard truth. Use your "critical thinking skills" and realize that those countries are nowhere near "normal". The fact they still have their borders closed is a fucking huge red flag in and of itself.</p>
<p>To comment further on what you've stated...</p>
<p>I think much of the problem with this sub is many people are delusional, and seem to have this train of thought that "(insert thing) happened and therefore we are going back to normal!" or "(insert thing) indicates we're being saved because (insert other thing) is going on in (insert location)! The tide's turning!". They're clinging to false hope and perpetuating stories they made up in their head to justify that normal is returning within whatever allotted amount of time they say. It's been happening since April 2020. I even see the same exact regulars pushing their own goalposts further and further down the road. They just don't want to act in order to save themselves, and also don't want to accept that matters are way worse than they want to admit.</p>
