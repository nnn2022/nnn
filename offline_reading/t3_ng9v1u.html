        <p>If this was not a sub for science denial you guys missed the mark. Almost every person posting and upcoming on this board is pushing the same talking points about 'gene therapy' with no idea how any of it works.</p>
<p>Want to learn how the vaccines work? Look it up from the CDC and other health organizations, where literally thousands of doctors and scientists pool their information and skills to keep us safe.</p>
<p>I don't mask up or get a vaccine for myself. I do for my family members that are immune compromised, and even your family members that are immune compromised.</p>
<p>I practice safety for others, I hope you all have a change of heart and try it too.</p>

<p>This is completely false. The vaccines have been through rigorous testing.</p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577</p>
<p>"A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6)."</p>
<p>And now for the part where you go "that's not what I was saying" and move the goalposts to "I was saying they haven't been tested over a long term." Go ahead and make that point and I'll rebut it by talking about the well-documented long term effects of covid.</p>

        <p>My students have all taken their AP test. Other students haven't taken their tests yet. Since some people haven't finished their tests, I guess I should tell my students they haven't been tested.</p>
<p>My point is that in just this study over 44k people were tested. Notice the past tense. Just because the drugs continue to be studied does not mean their safety hasn't already undergone intense research.</p>

        <p>About what? I forgot already. Are you a science denier and a vaccine injury denier? Yes. Well that is where you are wrong. Denying science is wrong. Sorry I don't have a citation. Do you think being a science denier is cool or something. Sorry. I genuinely do not care about you or this conversation. Science deniers do not interest me except for me to feel disgust and revulsions for them. If you are a science denier that is all on you and you are doing it alone. I will not be joining you in your science denial or helping you with it. Science denial is disgusting and if we were having this discussion face to face I would legitimately punch you right in the nose for your disgusting science denial. I fucking hate science deniers. You are a science denier and a vaccine injury denier right. Sorry. I wouldn't punch you. I would try to explain to you why science is right and your shouldn't be a science denier.</p>
