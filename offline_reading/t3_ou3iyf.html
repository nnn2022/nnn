    <strong>Is there a racist component to these mandates?</strong>
    <p><p>I've read a lot about the racist nature of minimum wage laws, and of the drug war.  I find it difficult to believe this could still be happening today, but African-Americans have the lowest vaccine rates.  If someone wanted to target them, limit their movement, etc. the mandates would certainly accomplish that.  Thoughts?</p>

        <p>Listen, I don’t buy into that white man bad bullshit. I don’t think the United States is racist at all. However, the black community has had a really rough past and I think that maybe they’re just smart enough to not take it. Maybe they have some type of survival-based suspicion that tells them not to put this into their system.</p>

        <p>As long as their are racists in office and in powers of authority America will take the rap of being racist. What you have is individuals who represent the US government displaying their personal prejudices. That being said i don't think their is a racial element to this at the moment.</p>

        <p>I think the black population is a head of the curve here for distrust in the government. I don't think there is a racial agenda here, I just think the black community is smart to be hesitant. Dumb white liberals rush in to suck the cock of their government.</p>
<p>I will add that there is a racial component to this but only tangentially. Because the black community has more melanin in their skin they have, as a consequence, less vitamin d. And those with low vitamin d in their systems can be affected by covid more seriously so it would be recommended to make sure your vitamin d levels are up.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm inclined to agree that since they haven't been fucked over as bad as blacks, they don't see the danger, just blind trust.</p>

        <p>I do not believe there is any racist ideology behind the mandates. Pretty sure they just really want EVERYONE to get the clot shot... I think a lot of what is causing the low vaccination rates among the African American communities in the US has a lot to do with the distrust for the government. Tuskegee experiments anybody?</p>
