    <strong>Spent significant money in the underground covid economy today. Feels good to help people out.</strong>
    <p><p>I just spent significant money in the underground CA covid economy today.   It feels really good to help people out, and it's even better to see how many people really think the lockdown hysteria is overkill and are willing to continue with normal transactions, even if on the down-low.</p>
<p>Also, the Newsom recall is getting close!    Download, sign, mail back in the official petition at https://recallgavin2020.com   If you can share with your friends that would also help.    Signature deadline is March 2021.</p></p>
