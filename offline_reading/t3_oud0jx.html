    <strong>To my fellow Canadians... This is important!</strong>
    <p><p>RE: Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations (Interim Order Respecting the Importation, Sale and Advertising of Drugs for Use in Relation to COVID-19)</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Canadian government has amended the Food and Drug Regulations awarding manufacturers of COVID related drugs "flexibilities" circumventing standard regulatory process, which in turn will allow them to be defacto approved by Health Canada. This will give the government justification to mandate vaccines and, possibly, implement vaccine passports.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Before I get started, here's some quick background info courtesy of Heath Canada:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>"The COVID-19 pandemic posed an immediate and significant risk to the health and safety of Canadians. To address the associated public health need in Canada, the Minister of Health made a number of interim orders to expedite and facilitate access to drugs, medical devices and foods for a special dietary purpose. The Minister used the power granted under section 30.1 of the Food and Drugs Act to make these interim orders.</em></p>
<p><em>The ISAD IO came into effect on September 16, 2020, and provided:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>an optional, expedited authorization pathway for the importation, sale and advertising of drugs to be used in relation to COVID-19</em></li>
<li><em>modified requirements for drug establishment licence (DEL) applications for those drugs</em></li>
<li><em>the introduction of a mechanism for the placement of COVID-19 drugs in Canadian facilities prior to the authorization to sell in Canada (pre-positioning)"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ok cool...you're probably wondering why I'm posting something we all know already...that these vaccines (just like in the USA  with their Emergency Use Authorization) are currently being distributed under an interim order to import, sell and advertise drugs during COVID-19 (known as ISAD IO).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here's the part you may not know about:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>"The ISAD IO ends 1 year after it came into effect. After this time, drugs authorized through the ISAD IO would no longer have been legally permitted to be sold in Canada, unless transition measures were implemented.</em></p>
<p><em>The ISAD IO provided a temporary emergency authorization for COVID-19 drugs to address the pandemic. The authorization was not a notice of compliance. In order for drugs to receive an NOC, a submission needs to be made under Division 8 of the Food and Drug Regulations."</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So what does this mean?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This means that effective September 16, 2021, the vaccines would "no longer have been legally permitted to be sold in Canada" because they were not issued a Notice of Compliance (NOC), essentially Health Canada's seal of approval.</p>
<p>Some requirements were waived to fast track COVID related drugs in light of the pandemic, exempting them from standard regulatory process under the Food and Drug Regulations.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, here's where things gets interesting. To address this, they have implemented "transition measures".</p>
<p>What are the "transition measures" you ask?</p>
<p>They have made an amendment to the Food and Drug Regulations to exempt all COVID related drugs from the standard regulatory process by awarding them some "flexibilities".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lets take a look at one such flexibility:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>exemption from the requirements for “detailed reports of the tests made to establish the safety” and “substantial evidence of the clinical effectiveness” of the new drug under paragraphs C.08.002(2)(g) and (h) if the applicant is able to provide sufficient evidence that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks, taking into account uncertainties as well as the public health need related to COVID-19 (subsection C.08.002(2.1));</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now I don't know about you, but I think this is <strong>INSANE</strong>.</p>
<p>The manufacturer are <strong>NOT</strong> required to provide “detailed reports of the tests made to establish the safety” and “substantial evidence of the clinical effectiveness” so long as they are able to provide sufficient evidence that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks.</p>
<p><strong>LET ME REPEAT THAT</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOT required to provide detailed reports of the tests made to establish the safety</strong></p>
<p><strong>and</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOT required to provide substantial evidence of the clinical effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What they are doing is changing the regulations to cater to the needs of the manufacturers and get these vaccines to market as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>If I am interpreting this correctly, the vaccines will essentially be defacto Health Canada approved on September 16, 2021.</p>
<p>If they do become Health Canada approved, the government will use this as justification to mandate vaccines and then roll out the vaccine passports.</p>
<p>This manipulation of regulatory processes in favor of Big Pharma needs to end immediately!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

        <p>Thank you for this.  I suppose that this will mean they will jump straight to vaxxing children.  Like they gave it to pregnant women before testing was even underway, and told people to mix and match against manufacturers recommendations.</p>
<p>I am ready to lose my job, pulling my kid out of school will be harder.</p>

        <p>Excellent work bringing this to our attention. I weep for our nation. This is such a terrible path we are headed down.</p>
<p>I do wonder however if the "approval" by Health Canada negates the no liability clause for the pharmaceutical companies. Since it's no longer emergency use and it's "tested" there would be liability right? If not the pharmaceutical companies than Health Canada?</p>
