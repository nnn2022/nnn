    <strong>New Policy at Notre Dame - a sign of things to come?</strong>
    <p><p>I had to drop everything to post this here. This is outrageous.</p>
<p>I had previously made this account as a one-off to post about the conditions at my school and look for support/advice from others who may in the same situation.</p>
<p>But anyway, Notre Dame just had a big game last weekend. I had missed a randomly assigned COVID test so I couldn't go even though I had tickets. A lot of people broke the rules (obviously) and so Notre Dame's campus president (read: authoritarian dictator) decided to send out an email in response (after already sending out an email with plenty of changes before the game). Of note are the following elements (bold has been added by me):</p>
<p>&rt;1. <strong>Because we are now even more concerned about the potential for contagion in your home communities as you prepare to travel home at the end of the semester, the University will place a registration hold on the record of any student who fails to appear for testing when asked to do so.</strong> A registration hold would mean that you are unable to matriculate or register for classes next semester or receive a transcript. This is a change from an earlier communication from Erin Hoffmann Harding and Mike Seamon which stated that those who failed to appear would lose priority status for registration. <br>
&rt;
&rt;2. <strong>Furthermore, you may not leave the South Bend area until you receive the results of your exit test.</strong> Again, should we discover that you have left the area, we will place a registration hold on your record.<br>
&rt;
&rt;3. <strong>There will be zero tolerance for any gatherings that do not comport with our health and safety guidelines, on or off campus.</strong> Those found responsible for hosting such gatherings will face severe sanctions.</p>
<p>Do with all of that what you will.</p>
<p>Additionally, this was located near the end:</p>
<p>&rt;We recognize that such steps may require some to adjust plans and schedules, but these obligations are critical for your health, as well as the health of our campus, our local community, and the communities to which you will travel for break. <strong>The grave circumstances of this pandemic compel us to take these exceptional measures.</strong></p>
<p>I worry that Notre Dame is only the beginning. We led the way at the beginning of the semester, and I feel we are once again leading the way to even worse conditions.</p></p>

        <p>Best plan is to get multiple separate copies of your transcript mailed to you and keep them sealed in their original envelopes. You can use these to apply for transfer to less strict schools. Do this <em>before</em> they call you in for any tests. Vote with your dollar. Put hard-earned money somewhere better.</p>

        <p>Even if I had the money to sue, their rules are vague enough that they have an easy out. On their list of “behaviors inconsistent with the university’s expectations for membership in this community” are things such as:</p>
<p>-“actions which seemingly affect only the individual(s) involved but which may have a negative or disruptive impact on the University community and/or concern a student’s personal and academic growth”</p>
<p>-“failure to follow the directive of a University official aimed at protecting life, health or safety, or necessary for the good order and proper functioning of the University community.”</p>
<p>There’s much more than this, but these are the general ideas. And because they’re a private university, the only way to stop this is for the extremely wealthy alumni to stop donating.</p>

        <p>I’m so glad all of this shit didn’t happen when I was still in college. I would have been so angry and yet surrounded by liberals who agreed with it. I didn’t fully recognize how liberal they all were because I just focused on studying and getting my degree. I wasn’t part of the social scene. Looking back at it all, I was so naive and had no real idea what I was surrounded by and how outnumbered I truly was by students and professors.</p>

        <p>I was in college 15 years ago, and I really struggle to imagine any of the students would have complied with this kind of thing back then. It blows my mind to see college age people being so complacent now. Even though I went to an art school, I feel like the attitude of the general 18-22 set back then was so very “fuck the man”, that there is no way this would’ve been able to happen. </p>
<p>Of course, just 15 years ago, we weren’t under the constant surveillance of our peers but still.</p>

        <p>I was in college only 7 years ago, so I'm in the millennial group and they would have totally gone along with lockdowns and masks back then as much as they're doing right now. The level of virtual signal hasn't changed one bit, only become even more entrenched in their psyche.</p>

        <p>No one wants to fuck their neighbor by making them sick. No one wants to be a shitty person. If I knew I were sick, there’s no way I would do something to endanger any one else. I just don’t need to be forced to pretend that I don’t understand my own body. I know to cover my mouth if I cough or sneeze. I don’t need a piece of cloth to help me out with that. I also don’t need to be forced to make myself faceless and invisible. </p>

<p>President wasn’t socially distancing and got covid. Tell him to get bent. They are just worried about the bad PR. Typical ND. More worried about their place in the world than the wellbeing of their students. Make sure to let him know that wealthy donors will no longer be contributing to their fund if they continue to act like this.</p>
<p>Just curious how many students have tested positive at this point? And how many people have died since school started back up?</p>

        <p>I didn’t storm the field. Like I said my ticket was voided for missing a covid test.</p>
<p>According to their website (as of 9:50am on Nov 9), there have been a total of 1,355 positive cases, with 208 of them active now. None of them have resulted in deaths (the only student deaths reported this semester were from a serious car accident).</p>
<p>They have performed a total of 68,706 tests on students and staff with a 4.4% positivity rate (and, again, a 0% death rate). This rate is actually much lower across campus since daily tests are given to those already tested positive, and tests are required of suspected students.</p>

        <p>Sorry for the delayed response. I'll just give a summary of all their testing.</p>
<p>Here is a direct link to all the data they've made public: <a href="https://here.nd.edu/our-approach/dashboard/">ND COVID Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year they sent out nasal swab tests to everyone's personal address, which had to be negative for them to be allowed back on campus. These were not reported on the dashboard, which was still in the works at the time.</p>
<p>After that point they began performing primarily diagnostic tests for anyone who had been exposed to COVID or displayed symptoms. These were determined based on seating arrangements in classes, which were made permanent soon after the beginning of the semester, as well as daily health checks, which gave students a green, yellow, or red pass (yellow passes were recommended tests, red passes were required tests).</p>
<p>After a surge in cases due to a weekend of parties off campus, they shut down campus and reevaluated. They then began ramping up testing to include randomized surveillance tests in addition to diagnostic tests. Overall positivity rates were still decreasing or plateauing during the warm weather even as testing increased. They also added saliva tests in order to get more funding in mid-September.</p>
<p><strong>At this point in time, each day (excluding weekends) sees about 1500 tests, which is over 10% of the student body each day (likely over 15%, since grad students are mostly off campus this semester).</strong></p>
<p>I personally am selected for a test about every other week, sometimes more. </p>
<p>Point is, there are not a significant number of students testing positive for COVID. The number of students on that field with symptomatic COVID was likely 0, which leaves only asymptomatic students.</p>
<p>Notre Dame is really playing up the cases and the severity by quite a bit.</p>

        <p>Wow that’s really crazy. I’m so sorry you have to deal with all that nonsense. The most important thing is that students stay away from the elderly. That’s how we prevent deaths. Not with assigned seating or random testing of asymptomatic college kids. </p>
