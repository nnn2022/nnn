        <p>This. That’s the fucking problem with arguing against this shit.
There are a ton of things you can use as a simile for this but it’s like someone putting an alarm system on their house and getting that sticker on their window or sign in their yard that says “we have an alarm!”. If they never get robbed then they can claim that the alarm system was well worth it. If they do they can say they did everything they could and not feel regret.
It’s tiresome.</p>

        <p>ok so i was going through the list of cognitive biases as opposed to logical fallacies to see which it was and look at this lol </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases</p>
<p>The Cult of Doomerism(The Cult of <em>Error</em>) </p>
<p>availability cascade - A self-reinforcing process in which a collective belief gains more and more plausibility through its increasing repetition in public discourse (or "repeat something long enough and it will become true"). (msm is mind control)</p>
<p>bandwagon effect - The tendency to do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same. Related to groupthink and herd behavior.</p>
<p>cheerleader effect - The tendency for people to appear more attractive in a group than in isolation.(lock us down daddy, suffering is freedom!) </p>
<p>courtesy bias - The tendency to give an opinion that is more socially correct than one's true opinion, so as to avoid offending anyone. (i hate wearing a mask and know it’s useless but i gotta get paid/laid y’know)</p>
<p>defense attribution hypothesis - Attributing more blame to a harm-doer as the outcome becomes more severe or as personal or situational similarity to the victim increases (anti maskers should be shot on sight!) </p>
<p>egocentric bias - Occurs when people claim more responsibility for themselves for the results of a joint action than an outside observer would credit them with. (general doomerism) </p>
<p>false consensus effect - The tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which others agree with them. </p>
<p>false uniqueness bias - The tendency of people to see their projects and themselves as more singular than they actually are. (i’m speshul bc i cover my disgusting face holes for my globalist slave masters :3) </p>
<p>group attribution error - The biased belief that the characteristics of an individual group member are reflective of the group as a whole or the tendency to assume that group decision outcomes reflect the preferences of group members, even when information is available that clearly suggests otherwise. (the only good anti masker is a dead one obv.) </p>
<p>groupthink - zero critical evaluation </p>
<p><strong>halo effect</strong> - The tendency for a person's positive or negative traits to "spill over" from one personality area to another in others' perceptions of them (see also physical attractiveness stereotype). (see bill gates, trudeau, obama etc..) </p>
<p>hostile attribution bias - The "hostile attribution bias" is the tendency to interpret others' behaviors as having hostile intent, even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign. (grandma killers!!!)</p>
<p><strong>illusion of asymmetric insight</strong> - People perceive their knowledge of their peers to surpass their peers' knowledge of them. (science is science, unless i don’t agree with it) </p>
<p>illusion of transparency - The tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others, and to overestimate how well they understand others' personal mental states. (we see you doomers ;))</p>
<p>just-world hypothesis - The tendency for people to want to believe that the world is fundamentally just, causing them to rationalize an otherwise inexplicable injustice as deserved by the victim(s). &lt;—- the great new normal world reset </p>
<p>naïve cynicism - Expecting more egocentric bias in others than in oneself. (anti maskers are so selfish!! freedom is slavery!!) </p>
<p>puritanical bias - Refers to the tendency to attribute cause of an undesirable outcome or wrongdoing by an individual to a moral deficiency or lack of self-control rather than taking into account the impact of broader societal determinants(the great reset is a conspiracy theory, no one wants to take your freedoms neocon... acab!! just arrest and execute all science deniers pls &lt;3) </p>
<p>social comparison bias - The tendency, when making decisions, to favour potential candidates who don't compete with one's own particular strengths. (<em>this is why propagandists are designed to be perceived as non-threatening and weak because that is the average mind controlled human’s base line</em>)</p>
<p>i hope this was interesting</p>

<p>this is why it's always Gates or Fauci or some other testosterone-free limp-wristed adult virgin playing hype man but what gets wild is when they inculcate a couple generations in sequence via this feckless archecuck and the peasants start emulating that as their like romantic ideal hero figure, and the non-threatening salesman has to be made even softer to keep relative with the buyers.  if that makes any sense.</p>

        <p>I'm not surprised, people often don't make an effort to search out the data and come up with their own conclusions as they are busy or have limited interest.  They get bombarded with government warnings and msm case counts.</p>
<p>Another interesting example is that Florida, which has not had significant lockdown measures for some time like many other states should be experiencing significant case counts; however, they aren't even in the top ten states as far as cases per capita.</p>

<p>The first link in this comment (second on OP’s slide) appears to show—in the table’s third column—that there were 12% more deaths overall due to COVID-related causes than were expected based on average deaths in previous years (2017-2019).</p>
<p>I also can’t find the projected number of deaths by 31 Dec used on OP’s slide in either of the links. Is that somewhere on the CDC website? Or did he just project it by multiplying the average number of deaths per day himself?</p>

<p>I can't speak to the "expected" deaths. It's possible that they expected the life expectancy to go up, and a failure to realize that is being attributed to covid. Maybe it's based on where we're at in the year, expecting a non-uniform death rate (Christmas season is peak suicide season).</p>
<p>But scaling 2020's 11 months of data, we would expect 
2,814,052 total deaths.</p>

        <p>CDC’s website briefly explains how they calculated expected deaths (per week) in the footnotes:</p>
<p>&rt; Percent of expected deaths is the number of deaths for all causes for this week in 2020 compared to the average number across the same week in 2017–2019.</p>
<p>So what they’re saying is that they’re seeing on average 12% more deaths per week in 2020–due to all causes, not just COVID—than we had in 2017-2019. I do wonder if they’re controlling for population changes in that, but assume they’re smart enough to do so. </p>
<p>So why would the CDC claim that there have been 12% more deaths this year than expected, when it looks like the current death totals appear roughly the same as—or even lower than—previous years’?</p>
<p>Because the total is currently incomplete and underreported.
- Death data lags in being received, entered, and analyzed by around 2 months (CDC repeats this twice in the footnotes), so deaths in 2020 from at least September on are currently underreported.
- Deaths are not evenly spread across every week of the year. As you mentioned, there’s a spike of suicides (among other deaths, like accidents and poverty-related deaths) around the holidays and in winter—so it’s not fully accurate to just multiply today’s average by the number of days left and add that to the current yearly total to estimate a complete yearly total. We’re missing a decent chunk of deaths that will bump up the average, since we haven’t hit December yet.</p>
<p>TL;DR we won’t realistically be able to tell how big COVID’s impact was on death rates in 2020 until at least February 2021, when most of the data is entered and accounted for.</p>

        <p>I say there’s no pandemic because the numbers say that.  It’s just fake.  Same amount of people are dying as the last 3 years.  80% of people don’t even have symptoms who test positive.  Over 90% of deaths are people who are in LTC.  </p>
<p>I say not to take the vaccine because it is DNA altering technology and completely unnecessary.  I don’t know the shady purpose of it, but it definitely isn’t ethical.  </p>
<p>5g is a technology that can be used for mass surveillance as well as a crowd control/ pinpoint electromagnetic weapon.  It also can cause many health and environmental issues without it being concentrated.  It’s basically a crime against humanity.</p>
<p>Edit.  I’m not a wackadoodle.  I have done a lot of research into this.  Most of the things that get put up on this are censored.

        <p>It's up to you whether or not to take the vaccine. The Moderna one is a new type of vaccine, but it's not unethical, nor is it DNA-altering. You're misinformed by conspiracy theorists who don't understand what it is. But it's your body and your choice.</p>
<p>You're wrong about 5G. The mass surveillance point is valid, but is not specific to 5G. You're well and truly surveilled already. The rest of what you said about it is nonsense.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what you think that first link says. It doesn't say that it alters your DNA. It produces an immune response without a sample of the live virus.</p>
<p>Directed energy weapons are real, but they have nothing to do with 5G.</p>

        <p>When people mention 5G and covid together, basically what they are saying is that 5G may cause a toxic environment that affects many things, including people’s immune system. 
Immune system compromised by environment = higher likelihood of getting sick from anything, including covid.</p>

        <p>That's a ridiculous association to make, then. By that logic, it be equally correct to say that McDonald's causes COVID. Or not getting enough sleep. Or stress.</p>
<p>Maybe you've just seen people saying that toxic environment thing, but I've seen people say, verbatim, that "COVID is caused by 5G." Those people are crazy.</p>

        <p>Sociologists are going to be studying this era and writing books about it for some time.</p>
<p>I can't see how historians can look back on this and think we were acting in our own best interests by fining people for leaving their homes, telling people how many guests they can have over on their own property on a holiday, arresting people for not wearing masks to an outdoor religious event while turning a blind eye to tens of thousands of criminals rioting and destroying others personal property for months...</p>
<p>All because of a worse-than-normal flu season.</p>

        <p>If you look at the second link posted there (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm), there's the following footnote:</p>
<p>"Data during this period are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death."</p>
<p>There's therefore 1-8 weeks of deaths (~54,000-424,000 deaths) missing in the 2020 data, and when all is said and done we're on track for a bad year.</p>
<p>You can also take a look at the "percent of expected deaths" column, which shows us 10-20% above normal most weeks.</p>

        <p>I also don't think that you can just look at a raw number. You have to look at multiple years of data and determine a standard deviation. We can't realistically expect the exact same number of people to die every year.</p>

        <p>Me too, but in a few months these 2020 numbers will be fully finalized and we'll be able to point to it and go "look. You can't ignore this.", and it will be numbers who historians will always have to contend with. With all of the truth in front of you in this way, it's impossible for historians to look at this any other way</p>

        <p>A few of the biggest factors that people do not take into account when talking about the total number of deaths include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The number of deaths will be increased disproportionately due to the number of baby boomers who are dying, and will continue to die over the next 15 years or so. The reason I say "increased disproportionately" is because the average age of the American has gotten older as the boomer generation has gotten older, less people are having as many children so the average age increases pretty significantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of suicides has apparently increased pretty dramatically in 2020, I believe this is primarily due to lockdowns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of deaths due to individuals not being able to receive elective procedures is pretty substantial, I've heard the number to be around 85k this year.</p>

<p>Somehow, while dealing with this insanely deadly pandemic, the average life expectancy in the US has actually risen by 0.08%, the same increase as between 2018 and 2019, and better than the 0.03% increase between the two years before those.</p>
<p>So really, how much death ARE we spreading?</p>

        <p>Here's what I have. Updating my numbers as much as I can. Missing Death Data from January 2020, the CDC web page linked below started counting in Feb 2020 and also deaths lag by 3 weeks apparently. Hopefully a journalist or newsource will publish the total overall deaths for 2020.</p>

        <p>Early lockdown - not many cars on highways in Seattle area. Persisted for a few weeks at least, month+?</p>
<p>Presumably similar in other places. Historical flu death zone is Nov/Dec-March.</p>

        <p>Does anyone have the population statistics as well? I saw an article saying that that 2020 will have an excess of deaths due to covid but im thinking those "excess deaths" should also be adjusted to population for a better comparison.</p>

        <p>That's good news. Obviously in 2018 we did not have COVID killing people, so I'm going to assume that reductions in car accidents or some other uniquely 2020 difference has balanced it out. It also seems that suicides aren't tipping the scales in 2020, which is also  good news.</p>
<p>If anybody has more info on the actual causes of death, I'd be interested to see it.</p>

        <p>Are you going to look at the fact that death rates have been dropping year over year. According to those numbers you have, there will not be a drop from 2018 to 2020 once 2020 ends. </p>
<p>&rt; Between 2017 and 2018, death rates decreased 5.1% for age group 15–24 (from 74.0 deaths per 100,000 population in 2017 to 70.2 in 2018), 3.0% for age group 25–34 (132.8 to 128.8), 1.4% for age group 45–54 (401.5 to 395.9), 0.4% for age group 65–74 (1,790.9 to 1,783.3), 1.9% for age group 75–84 (4,472.6 to 4,386.1), and 0.9% for age group 85 and over (13,573.6 to 13,450.7) (Figure 3).</p>
<p>Do the math and you’ll see that the expected death rate we should have in 2020 should be LESS than 2018. But I guess you didn’t bother with that math, did you?</p>

        <p>College educated millennials. But I’d also say this is representative of many liberals as well. Lockdowns aren’t going to curb the virus because we don’t live in a country like China that is going to enforce it and track you. People will gather indoors instead of at outdoor dining places. </p>
<p>The biggest thing we can do now is try to interact with our friends and loved ones in well ventilated areas, preferably outside. And wear a mask when in a congregated place or indoors (except for inside your own house). It’s such easy guidelines yet we have a large portion of our population who can’t be arsed to wear a piece of cloth over their face. </p>
