    <strong>I'm a JNJ vaccine trial volunteer. Here's my letter to the head of my clinic explaining why I'm probably going to drop out.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi Dr. _____</p>
<p>I am a volunteer in the Ensemble study. </p>
<p>There has been very little communication from the study as of late. While I have not contracted COVID, nor have the many, many people I socialize with, I find myself less and less interested in supporting for-profit research by the day. Do I get a booster or not? Are these vaccines designed to stop transmission or simply symptomatic covid? If transmission occurs and no one gets sick, who cares? </p>
<p>Public health "experts" like Dr. Tom Frieden seem to believe that permanent indoor masking should be normalized. If that is to be the case, then I see little benefit in continuing to participate in the trial. I signed up because masks, distancing, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions have sucked the joy out of life. They have led to friends overdosing, loved ones becoming obese, and depression on a massive scale in my social circle. Jobs have been lost, dreams have been shattered, and pharma companies like J&amp;J and research clinics like yours seem to be making a lot of money. So what exactly do you still need me for? I thought I was contributing to the end of the pandemic, but instead I feel like a lab rat.</p>
<p>The promise was that these vaccines would bring life back to normal, and frankly, it seems that scientists and public health experts are totally okay living in a permanently masked, technocratic dystopia where we are simply to "trust the experts" without any right to ask "at what cost to our communities?" I would like to see better communication from you, Ensemble, and J&amp;J. I would like to see a goal established to <em>end the pandemic</em> and let people gather again without any restrictions or mandates. I would like to see transparency with your FDA approval process. </p>
<p>Months of silence are no longer acceptable, especially when you have "experts" salivating on television and social media about keeping people masked and distanced until the end of time. If there is no optimism for a "back to normal," then I don't see much point in continuing to contribute to this study.</p>
<p>Please let me know how J&amp;J plans to make this right for us.</p></p>
