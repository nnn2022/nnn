    <strong>How we can win conversations</strong>
    <p><p>When speaking with others, focus on No New Normal. It’s pointless to debate things like PCR tests, statistics, vaccines, man made v natural, whether it even exists or not, etc.
It’s a quagmire, would take too long, and we don’t know what’s real or not either. What we do know, and what we might get them to agree with, is that we can’t let this event fundamentally change society world wide forever. That’s insane and the people that do are the real extremists!</p></p>

        <p>I've found people just seem to not care. So long as they can avoid any personal inconvenience, they'll just play along with anything. "Oh, I've got to take a 5th booster shot of the experimental vaccine?, that's fine, don't want them to stop me going on holiday" "Masks are back to being a legal requirement, I don't want to cause anyone any offence so I'll make sure I'm carrying 3 of them, otherwise I'll have to work from home".</p>
<p>Insanity.</p>

        <p>There's no one-size-fits-all way to convince people. You need to find out what their weakness   is - the part of the mainstream narrative they are least sure of - and push against that.</p>
<p>Even then, you can't expect to persuade people right away. You can, however, create a seed of doubt that will grow as governments ramp up the New Abnormal.</p>

        <p>Need to put ourselves in a position for constructive debates somehow distinguishing from hardcore conspiracy theorists (even if some of those might be true, but one step at a time).</p>
<p>Someone posted just recently this <a href="https://doctors4covidethics.org/letter-to-physicians-four-new-scientific-discoveries-crucial-to-the-safety-and-efficacy-of-covid-19-vaccines/">nice article</a>, could be a good start to discuss it within a local community (at least I'll try).</p>

        <p>We need more discussions like this.</p>
<p>Is it better to hold on to one fact hammer that one true fact all the time?</p>
<p>Is it better to gently lead them in to a corner using their own logic?  This seems a valuable approach because they will try to squirm and project on to anything else but keeping them against the wall in a corner forces a thought to emerge.</p>
<p>I do know you have to treat them with respect and value them because the reason they are latching on to these totalitarian covert narcissist tactics is because their identity is hollow, they stand on quicksand, and have nothing of value to build or create.  Helping them create their own identity (apart from the MSM as well as even apart from your own) is extremely valuable.  You don't want them just blindly following what you say either.  You want them standing on their own.  Encourage this.</p>
<p>I'd love to talk more tactics.  I do feel like we forget all the stuff we know (and that they don't know) and we give up too easily.</p>

        <p>Most people, even if they believe all this virus stuff, don’t want to live in a totalitarian society. So by focusing on that aspect and pointing out that we are on the cusp of fundamental and permanent changes, we can find common ground.</p>

        <p>What seems to work for me is to ask a question and continue to show real statistics and valuable information. The majority claims that all we know comes from facebook posts and such and is not reliable information and linked to conspiracy theories.  </p>
<p>When a person asks for the reason why I'm not vaccinated, yet I have replied the following.</p>
<p>I start with a let's forget this Covid situation all together for a moment now, pretend this never happened and we're just sitting here having a discussion and ask them:<br>
You see an advertisement in a newspaper drafting for volunteers to test a new medication based on DNA technologies without payment, would you reply to this and do it?<br>
I've not had one single person reply with a yes to this question, they all don't want to do this.<br>
Than I confront them with the fact that this is exactly what's going on as the current mRNA vaccines are still in clinical trials.</p>
<p>Moderna goes until October 27, 2022:</p>
<p>source: <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04470427">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04470427</a></p>
<p>and Pfizer even longer until May 2, 2023:</p>
<p>source: <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This wakes them up a little bit already, but just a little bit.</p>
<p>Than I confront them with the reason how these companies were able to put these untested vaccines on the market so quickly:</p>
<p>Since 2005 we have had Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine as therapy treatments against respiratory diseases (like SARS v1 in that time) which were used with success.</p>
<p>source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1232869/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1232869/</a></p>
<p>The FDA has a rule in their Emergency Use Authorization which states the following:</p>
<p>quote: "FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives."</p>
<p>source: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained</a></p>
<p>What happened on the 15th of June 2020:</p>
<p>FDA Revokes Emergency Use Authorization for Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p>source: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-revokes-emergency-use-authorization-chloroquine-and">https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-revokes-emergency-use-authorization-chloroquine-and</a></p>
<p>Which allowed for mRNA vaccines to become Emergency Authorized.</p>
<p>This will seed even more doubt about these organizations as to why, we don't know exactly why but it suspicious at the very least.</p>
<p>Now it's time to continue with showing official statistics regarding vaccine adverse effects and I explain them VAERS with a link from the official CDC website:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vaers/index.html</a></p>
<p>followed by showing them the numbers on this VAERS website:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data/">https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data/</a></p>
<p>Remarks will follow that these are still low numbers compared to the amount of vaccines already put in people's bodies and I agree. But in any normal clinical trial, when it comes to death numbers over 5 the clinical trial is stopped by any means and the substance tested is going back to the drawing board, which is NOT the case right now as they're even making it obliged in some regions of the world.</p>
<p>On which I continue with a peer reviewed report on the effectiveness of the current PCR tests, in which they found that also normal influenza and even other viruses are marked as false positives but do end up in the statistics.</p>
<p>source: <a href="https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/">https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/</a></p>
<p>Followed by the official announcement from the CDC to start using different tests to distinguish influenza and covid from each other.</p>
<p>source: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2021/07-21-2021-lab-alert-Changes_CDC_RT-PCR_SARS-CoV-2_Testing_1.html">https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2021/07-21-2021-lab-alert-Changes_CDC_RT-PCR_SARS-CoV-2_Testing_1.html</a></p>
<p>And I end with stating that I have not shown any facebook post or conspiracy theory at all, but just official links to FDA and CDC websites and that for me this is enough to continue to think critically. I'm not anti-vaxx, but these mRNA "vaccines" are not vaccins at all but by the looks of it money and power making machines.</p>
