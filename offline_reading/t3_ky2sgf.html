    <strong>Why they don't care about our happiness.</strong>
    <p><p>(bulk of this is adapted, if you recognize it, good for you!)</p>
<p>There is a reason why whenever we are approached and engaged with here by those who disagree are so overwhelmingly trolls or disingenuous in there discussions.</p>
<p>To them it's like asking a cow that's in a tiny stall with no sunlight, no grass, no fresh air, no capacity to mate, or raise its own offspring.  It's like asking that cow if you could speak cow "well why are you unhappy?"</p>
<p>That cow is going to say "Its because I'm in a stall.  Because I'm being fed disgusting stuff.  Because I'm being kept in a constant state of pregnancy so I can produce milk.  Because I have no freedom, no fresh air, no healthy food, no mate, no family.  I'm a meat machine of milk and murder."</p>
<p>Well what are they going to say?  "Well you know I'm going to give you some tips on how to adjust to this situation."</p>
<p>And the cow is going to say "A: I can't. and B: I don't want to adjust I want this situation to change."</p>
<p>So if there is some animal going crazy in a zoo or some bear in some crazy ass Russian circus who dances and is whipped and starved.  And you say to the bear or you say to the animal in the zoo: "Well why are you unhappy?"</p>
<p>They'll say "Well I'm not in my natural element.  I'm controlled, I'm caged, I'm exploited.  I'm kept from all the natural cycles of life that bring me any kind of meaningful happiness."</p>
<p>And all they can say is: "Well let me help you adjust I'm going to give you some tips and tricks on how to adjust."</p>
<p>So doomers or society won't really start to ask why we are unhappy.  Because if society really starts to listen as to why we are unhappy well society is going to have to make some pretty significant changes that will put it in conflict with some pretty significant forces.  Like the state as a whole, the education system, the CDC, the WHO.</p>
<p>So society and the doomers are just like: "I don't wanna ask, I don't wanna know" because there is a whole machine in place against us.  Because if they genuinely start to ask why the people like us are unhappy the answer they will come to is "well...they're in lockdown."  "Why do we put people in lockdown?"  "For profit."  "So we can get federal money to bail out pension programs and hospitals can get bonuses for each treated covid case.  So that companies like Amazon can gain staggering wealth above all the little business that are getting stomped out."</p>
<p>"But why are people unhappy in a lockdown?  Cause they're in a lockdown!"  And telling us to adjust to being in a lockdown and telling us it's our fault we are unhappy and all we need are a couple of tweaks.  It comes out of the fact that the system is pretty horrific and nobody knows how to change it.  And changing it would be brutal.  Even trying to change it would be brutal.</p>
<p>Trying to plumb the depth of why we are unhappy would be pretty blackpilling for them.</p></p>
