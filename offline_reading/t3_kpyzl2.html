        <p>Just a heads up, that graph is meaningless. I'm not saying you're wrong. This could be an overblown scam and you're right! But don't use that graph as a talking point. You can't compare the AVERAGE of 3 years of data, against one year of actual month by month numbers. It doesn't mean anything, those are two different things. Again, not saying you're wrong, that graphic is just stupid, and possibly being used to subconsciously display a point the creator wanted to try and get across.</p>

        <p>Why can't you?  That average provides a decent baseline.  They do the exact same thing when calculating excess deaths.  They average 5 years to provide a baseline.</p>
<p>Also you are mistaken those aren't month by month numbers.  They are daily.  The average is also daily.</p>

        <p>&rt;says daily, how would I know that</p>
<p>Because it fluxuates.  If it were just one big average it wouldnt move.  That's obvious to anyone that has looked at more than one chart in their life.</p>
<p>&rt;If you added the average of 2020 into that red line, it would most likely look the same. </p>
<p>No it wouldn't.  It would be a straight line.</p>

        <p>Assuming that you were directly involved in this, can you give some advice on how to go about submitting a freedom of information request for anyone else that wants to submit their own request?
Although I'm sure that there will be differences, I think that there will probably be many similarities between countries and jurisdictions which would transfer over.</p>

<p>Again, I'm not saying you're wrong, or the government is right. I'm just saying it's stupid to compare:</p>
<p>How many oranges are in my fridge right now on Jan 4, compared to the past two Jan 4ths averaged together. </p>
<p>I could have had 28 oranges on Jan 4, 2018. And none
 on Jan 4, 2019. The average of those years is 14. </p>

<p>What does the 13 compared to 14 prove? Why wasn't it the average of 2010-2019 in that graph? Why did they pick 2017-2019? It's a stupid graph.</p>

        <p>This is not stupid at all.  It's done all the time in stats.  It's about establishing a baseline.  Maybe they should have gone back 5 years.  I'm not sure of the reason why they only requested 3 years.  But having a baseline is not some wild manipulative thing they are doing.</p>
<p>Look at any mortality chart and they have done the same thing.</p>

        <p>You're not sure of the reason why they only went back 3 years? Well that's the problem. That's why I'm saying it's a stupid graph. Why isn't the reason they choose only 3 years made clear? Did the person making the graph have access to years further back and choose to only use those years because it proved a point. Data can be easily manipulated to show anything. Any graph, or statistic that presents data, grouped together for no apparent reason, is suspect.</p>

<p>The BMJ only went back 3 years.  You should write them.  Tell them they are stupid.</p>
<p>For this graph above they got the data from a FOI request.  Perhaps that may have been the limiting factor, perhaps they only wanted 3 years for their baseline.</p>

        <p>The BMJ didn't write it....somebody submitted it....yes that/those person(s) are using poor sample sizes. The an BMJ is just a journal...it's like if I said you were Reddit...</p>
<p>But I don't wanna keep digging a tunnel further away. That stupid graph selected 3 years to average and then compare to 1 single year. That's dumb. Unless they explain why they chose to display data that way, then it's dumb. And showing me other examples of data displayed the same way...is STILL dumb, so don't waste you're time searching them. If you wanna say that " it's a  time tested, valid used method of proving a hypothesis" when then gimme the proof that it's valid, because other literal examples mean nothing. </p>

        <p>Months are not sample sizes.  </p>
<p>Thinking about it they probably used 2017-2018 because that was an especially bad year for hospitalizations.  Even so, they didn't lockdown that year and destroy the economy for years to come.  Which is the point of the comparison.</p>

        <p>Please provide proof that 2017- 2018 (sic) were "an especially bad year for hospitalizations.?</p>
<p>Also, there you go, you just said that the point of that graph was to show there is no need for a lockdown. Why? ...Where do you see that? All you see is one line higher than another line. Which year specifically are you comparing this year to? You can't because that red line is and AVERAGE. All those other years definitely looked all "up and down" like the black line. You could have day by day, and month by month compared the data together and probably seen that hospitals are always randomly busy as fuck sometimes and then not busy other times. What does bed usage have to do with needing a lockdown anyway? If we're tested positive, aren't we supposed to quarantine at home? Not in a hospital bed? </p>
<p>THAT GRAPH IS COMPARING A RANDOM SELECTION OF YEARS, AVERAGED TOGETHER, AND THEN COMPARING THEM TO ONE YEAR ONLY. IT IS A BAD DISPLAY OF DATA, AND ALL OTHER EXAMPLES OF IT ARE ALSO POOR DISPLAYS OF DATA. </p>
<p>Do you know why it's a poor display of data? Because the two of us can actually argue over it....a fact should be a fact....and yet here we are arguing over the validity of a form of data representation. </p>
<p>The years to average together were cherry picked and selected together, with no reason given....end of story....bad graph....don't use it.</p>

        <p>Regardless, they could have just shown 2017-2018, a particularly bad year and it would have had the same.effect.  The point is hospitalizations are not extraordinary and even low compared to another bad year.  And the idea that they are destroyong people's lives to save the hospitals takes a hit.</p>
<p>Personally I think you are overreacting.</p>

        <p>You're not showing a graph about this "particularly bad year" though. That's just something you're saying. </p>
<p>Also hospital beds...doesn't equal people infected and in quarantine at home. </p>
<p>There are many virus variables that affect how serious of a threat it is treated. Like if it's contagious before symptoms, or after symptoms. Or if it is air borne or not. How long it's contagious for. And whether treatment exists. It may not seem like it to you, because people aren't turning into zombies around you, but there is an actual reason the world is trying hard to deal with a problem, while also trying to keep as many people with a means to survive, it's hard to do both. I'm sorry you're going through a hard time right now. I hope it ends for you soon, it sucks we were born in this time.</p>

        <p>A lot of people are incapable of understanding trade-offs. The only thing they know how to do is laser focus on a single metric while completely ignoring everything else. That's why the number one line you will always hear from doomers is "But look at the death count!" as if that is the magic bullet that can't be argued against. Once you do present a counter argument, they short circuit and start resorting to ad hominems as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>As Henry Hazlitt once wrote:</p>
<p>"The bad economist sees only what immediately strikes the eye; the good economist also looks beyond. The bad economist sees only the direct consequences of a proposed course; the good economist looks also at the longer and indirect consequences. The bad economist sees only what the effect of a given policy has been or will be on one particular group; the good economist inquires also what the effect of the policy will be on all groups...</p>
<p><em>The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups."</em></p>

        <p>130 million <em>additional</em> people likely starving last year due to global trade and supply chains being ground to a halt by senseless lockdowns and restrictions, according to the UN.</p>
<p>That's a single second-order consequence. Then you have all the increased suicides, self-harm, homicides, abuse, poverty, unemployment, hunger, overdoses, deaths of despair, loneliness, depression and dementia, especially in the isolated elderly, who people claim to be doing all this for, etc. etc., the true costs of which won't fully play out or be known for years to come.</p>

        <p>So if lockdown forced you into poverty (like it has to around 150 million people worldwide) that's somehow your fault? If lockdown caused you to miss check ups and treatments so your cancer is no longer treatable and you only have a few months left, that's also your fault? If lockdowns have forcibly isolated you in essentially solitary confinement away from all of your loved ones for months on end, you are weak for feeling depressed or even suicidal because of that? Or people who can't escape domestic abuse? The list is endless.</p>
