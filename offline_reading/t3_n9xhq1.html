    <strong>I think it's extremely contradictory Bill Gates talks about overpopulation/climate being a problem, and then he wants to save as many lives as possible through supporting this new type of vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>You think the world will have a population crisis, but you want to save lives? He doesn't have to be vocal about it either, non of the elites have to, they could just keep quiet and not make a vaccine or push for one in the news and let the masses die. But they are vocal. They're acting like they want to save everyone. Which is why you shouldn't want to take the vaccine or their advice, it's so much more than that... <strong>Think about your own personal experience, it doesn't match the "covid is so deadly" narrative. If they wanted healthy citizens, they would advocate for exercise, diet, and vitamin D. But nah, INJECTIONS AND MASKS. Not a peep of natural health.</strong></p>
<p>Shouldn't the population be anti-natalist if they care about the world environment? Anyone can have as many kids as they want... I suppose more people for them keeps the matrix system operating.</p></p>
