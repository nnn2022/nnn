        <p>Well, agreed that the coronavirus period has been difficult for many small businesses. </p>
<p>And it sucks that you have suffered because of the lockdown, agreed.   </p>
<p>But you're waaaaay off on the basis that the lockdown was for naught. And yes, this is a situation where the government should've helped out.   </p>
<p>However, freedom of commerce... as you call it, still exists. People buy stuff all the time. But just online during the lockdown period.   </p>
<p>But your whole anwsers strays from the point of this dumbass meme rather fast. Your rights and freedoms haven't been attacked or taken away, you've just ended in a shitty situation and you need to blame someone/something.</p>

        <p>oh, so freedom of commerce only applies to Amazon? </p>
<p>and no, I'm not waaaay off. I'm not off at all. Normally, when there's a deadly virus going around, they quarantine the sick people. This time they just quarantined everyone based on the lie of "asymptomatic spread" which was total bullshit and only perpetuated by false positives from the use of overcycled PCR tests.</p>

        <p>What exactly is freedom of commerce? Freedom to sell stuff? You still have that, but there were restrictions. Are you going to say that if you're house is on fire and the fireman doesn't let you run in there, then your freedoms are being restricted again? <br>
If a lifeguard saves you at the beach, is he restricting your freedom to sit underwater without breathing?</p>
<p>Okay. So you don't understand how coronavirus works, that explains it. </p>
<p>You call it a lie. Great, prove it. Prove it to the millions of medical workers all across the world. This is the most fun part. Americans and yeah, I dare guess you are one, think that America is the only country in the world. Asymptomatic spread was confirmed by doctors all across the planet. But sure, you and your youtube videos and that one crackpot doctor you found are the ones that are correct. Cause yeah, that's how things work.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna do this only once, cause since I'm obviously getting downvoted a shitton, I have to wait after every reply and I really can't be arsed. There are too many of you unintelligent people here for me to be able to reply to all.   </p>
<p>I can't find the original source where I found the things I said in my post, so I had to do the hard job of googling "common flu and coronavirus comparison". Which probably is something none of you geniuses have done, because the government and big brother and illuminati and the jews are going to find a way to lie to you. <br>
The very first reply was from American CDC: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm</a>  </p>
<p>I'll copy some statements: </p>
<p>1) "COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu."</p>
<p>2) "Compared to flu, COVID-19 can cause more serious illnesses in some people. COVID-19 can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer."  </p>
<p>Oh, but the angry monkey reading this right now is shaking his fist. CDC IS FULL OF LIES! <br>
Well let's check another source: <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-similarities-and-differences-with-influenza">https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-similarities-and-differences-with-influenza</a><br>
1) "Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. "</p>
<p>2) "While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection."</p>
<p>3) "Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care."  </p>
<p>Oh, but the monkey is going again: "Bah, WHO is under the claw of CHAIIIIIINAA (HAIL TRUMP)". So let's try more... how about from UK: <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health/coronavirus-symptoms-cold-flu-or-coronavirus">https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health/coronavirus-symptoms-cold-flu-or-coronavirus</a></p>
<p>1) "On average, it takes 5 days for coronavirus symptoms to appear, but can take up to 10 days."..."Flu symptoms tend to come on very suddenly, and make you feel too ill to carry out normal activities."</p>
<p>This one doesn't seem to have many more things. But still a comparison. It's almost as if other countries don't have to deal with same amount of bullshittery.</p>
<p>But heck, I found another... Ireland this time. <a href="https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/symptoms/overview/">https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/symptoms/overview/</a></p>
<p>Oh and I even found an Estonian one that's in english:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.terviseamet.ee/en/what-covid-19">https://www.terviseamet.ee/en/what-covid-19</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So... you know.. go debunk the healthcare systems of 4 countries. Have fun.</p>

<p>Your first quote already uses the word "seems" Not is, but seems...</p>
<p>The third link claims that you can only differentiate the two by using a PCR Test. Which as we all know by now are virtually useless....</p>

        <p>Guns, actually. All of this authoritarian bullshit along with the riots has more or less defeated the anti-2A argument by putting all of its folly on blast.</p>
<p>There's a reason we're seeing so many pro-2A moves on the local level from so many different locations.</p>

        <p>Well, when the pandemic started I admit, quite a few governments overreacted. Mostly cause the illness was still rather unknown and really really really stupid people weren't taking it seriously.   </p>
<p>And when it comes to parties. IT WAS ABOUT ALL PARTIES. You think social distancing should happen only with strangers? That if you know a person well enough, viruses won't bother. That's... dumb. If during a pandemic idiots can't keep from partying for a bit, then probably government has to step it. It's not a nice step, but whatcha gonna do when idiots wanna spread a deadly illness.</p>

        <p>Who said anything about parties, i just want some dinner at night with many family members.</p>
<p>I don't give a fuck about the governments or others opinion.</p>
<p>And you cant blame the youth for not taking it seriously, they are young and need to party, they dont give a damn about your granny. I would be too if i were a teen right now. Because oh no a big scary virus is gonna kill everyone xD everybody with common sense knows that's not really gonna happen. </p>
<p>Dont be an OCD authoritarian controlfreak asshole, let people spread it if they want too. U cant stop viruses anyway. Its not a sci-fi movie.</p>
