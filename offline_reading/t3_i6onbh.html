        <p>Excellent article. Sums it all up so well. If only I could share this on social media and change a few minds... but the attacks i inevitably suffer only steer the sheep further into their narrow minded beliefs.</p>

        <p>I may have but not sure. I'm going to search for them now tho! Omg if the world would only listen.. 
And good for you for sharing! I'm starting to think I need new friends..who are more open minded like us. And then I might have a chance at helping to wake them up. The network I have now will NEVER change their beliefs. ðŸ˜¥</p>

        <p>Honestly, I am lucky I have a friend, several actually, who thinks like us. I donâ€™t know how I would cope if I didnâ€™t have these friends. The article I shared was about teens not being able to cope with the lockdown so they were self harming. I made a good heading.  Havenâ€™t had many comments (1!), as most ignore anything outside the MSM narrative but itâ€™s a start. This is funny, although not really. I got a message from a friend, basically a doomer. It was a video about wearing masks. I asked him, what is this. He said oh itâ€™s just a funny video. Ok. So I sent him the article by the Danish infectious disease experts. Saying masks are basically useless. Guess what he said??  Why are you sending me right wing propaganda!!!! Seriously. My friend was with me and she was stunned. I wonâ€™t tell you what she said. She is a Brit like me, lived in the US since the nineties. I arrived here in 2000. So we support each other. But I tell you. I am kind of terrified for my future. I had a bad day today. We have a major fire close by so that hadnâ€™t helped but still. It all just got to me today and I broke down in tears. Donâ€™t give up. I think there are more like us who stay silent for fear of being pandemic shamed but seek them out.!!</p>

        <p>Oh wow I'm so sorry you had such a shit day. And crying is a good release. I break down regularly now- ive never even been much of a cryer until now. And your friend calling an article propaganda is not surprising but just SO infuriating. My father is now calling me a conspiracy theorist- he basically has learned that term bc of covid and (what I call) the logical side/voice. There are now messgages out there saying anything that doesn't agree with doom is conspiracy. I've never considered myself into conspiracy at all but now bc we want some of the other experts who simply have a different perspective based on data to be even considered, we are lumped in with tinfoil hats. It angers me every day. Not only do i not have any friends who are skeptics, my partner (who thankfully is a skeptic) is just so sick of my endless ranting about it all. And she's right. It must be so draining for her. She doesn't feel so stressed by the worlds view. She thinks it'll all just eventually go away. I want to believe that but my fear just keeps me from having faith. So I come here to read and inform myself and in the hopes of seeing a glimmer of a turning point. But it's like chasing the dragon- you never get there. My goal now is to find some like minded friends I can see in person. I wish you well and so hope that today is a better day for you!!!</p>

        <p>Thank you. I had some success yesterday with a few people who finally came out of hiding and have agreed with stuff I have said!  Itâ€™s ridiculous how happy that makes me feel!  Itâ€™s a small victory but I will take anything at this point. I really canâ€™t imagine having a parent who didnâ€™t t agree with me on this!  An btw, I hate the expression conspiracy theorist. Itâ€™s meant as a derogatory term. Look, there are some who are a bit nuts..you know like flat earthers and Holocaust deniers, but there are extremes in every situation. Thank the lord your partner is not a doomer. I tell you. Relationships are going to end over all this. I wish I could be more relaxed about all this but I canâ€™t. This the most significant occurrence in my lifetime, imho.  I take it incredibly seriously. With consequences of course. I have to say once you start saying a few â€˜ controversial â€˜ things you might be surprised. Start simple. Donâ€™t go anywhere near masks!  But definitely start talking about lockdowns!!  Good luck!</p>

        <p>Your small victories are even giving me some hope! It's SO hard to stay hopeful but talking online (which is all I have right now) with pple like you is enough encouragement to want to take some small digestable steps. And I agree, keeping it simple is the best way. Thanks for your kind words and exchange :)</p>
