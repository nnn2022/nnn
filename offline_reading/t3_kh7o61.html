    <strong>Bourgeois v. Peters - "We cannot simply suspend or restrict civil liberties until the War on Terror is over, because the War on Terror is unlikely ever to be truly over."</strong>
    <p><p>"We ... reject the notion that the Department of Homeland Security's threat advisory level somehow justifies these searches. Although the threat level was "elevated" at the time of the protest, "[t]o date, the threat level has stood at yellow (elevated) for the majority of its time in existence. It has been raised to orange (high) six times." Given that we have been on "yellow alert" for over two and a half years now, we cannot consider this a particularly exceptional condition that warrants curtailment of constitutional rights. We cannot simply suspend or restrict civil liberties until the War on Terror is over, because the War on Terror is unlikely ever to be truly over. September 11, 2001, already a day of immeasurable tragedy, cannot be the day liberty perished in this country. Furthermore, a system that gave the federal government the power to determine the range of constitutionally permissible searches simply by raising or lowering the nation's threat advisory system would allow the restrictions of the Fourth Amendment to be circumvented too easily. Consequently, the "elevated" alert status does not aid the City's case."  </p>

        <p>"This argument is troubling.   While the threat of terrorism is omnipresent, we cannot use it as the basis for restricting the scope of the Fourth Amendment's protections in any large gathering of people."   </p>
<p>"The City's position would effectively eviscerate the Fourth Amendment.   It is quite possible that both protestors and passersby would be safer if the City were permitted to engage in mass, warrantless, suspicionless searches.   Indeed, it is quite possible that our nation would be safer if police were permitted to stop and search anyone they wanted, at any time, for no reason at all.   Cf. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (requiring that police demonstrate individualized suspicion that a suspect is armed before frisking him).   Nevertheless, the Fourth Amendment embodies a value judgment by the Framers that prevents us from gradually trading ever-increasing amounts of freedom and privacy for additional security.   It establishes searches based on evidence-rather than potentially effective, broad, prophylactic dragnets-as the constitutional norm."  </p>
<p>"The City's search policy also violates the First Amendment in five ways.   First, it is a burden on free speech and association imposed through the exercise of a government official's unbridled discretion;  restrictions on First Amendment rights may not be left to an executive agent's uncabined judgment...."     </p>
<p>"The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that burdens on First Amendment rights imposed by executive officials are invalid “in the absence of narrowly drawn, reasonable and definite standards for the officials to follow․  [A restriction is invalid when] [n]o standards appear anywhere;  no narrowly drawn limitations;  no circumscribing of this absolute power.”  Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, 271, 71 S.Ct. 325, 327, 95 L.Ed. 267 (1951)."</p>

        <p>Same argument applies to Coronavirus. It is unlikely that the CoVid-19 troublesome to people with extremely low Vitamin D levels strain will disappear anytime soon.</p>
<p>We would do better to simply send everyone in the United States a years supply of D3 5000 IU capsules and have done with this.</p>
<p>More and more doctors are saying that the vast majority of those who are dying from this virus, even from the cytokine storm and multi-organ failure, are dying due to severely low levels of Vit. D which prevents them from properly fighting off CoVid-19.</p>
