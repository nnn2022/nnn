    <strong>Had a pleasant reaction at the register today.</strong>
    <p><p>I had to run to the local hardware supply for a few small things this afternoon. This particular business has had a sign outside it's door for months about requiring face coverings. They had somebody outside enforcing things until last summer, when just the sign became a constant.</p>
<p>So today, I was going about my usual anti-masking venture in store, went to check out with the clerk, and  she told me that it was very refreshing to see a smile on somebody's face for a change. I told her "Well it was my own little protest" and she said if she could protest, that she would too..</p>

        <p>I barely wore my mask at work today. I think I get away with it because I'm in the warehouse side of things on a Hi-Lo. Yet my work area abuts part of the production floor. I'm not <em>invisible</em>. None of the production drivers seemed to give a shit to see me maskless. One or two seemed entertained by my grinning</p>

        <p>Yesterday was the first time i saw someone going into a store without a mask on and I was about to put a mask on but when I saw him go in without a mask I felt comfortable going in without a mask too so I thought fuck it I'm not wearing a mask and I was walking without a mask nobody said anything and the guy that went in without a mask first started greeting me.</p>
<p>I was kinda nervous at first because of the reactions I could expect from mask wearers but they didn't even dare to say anything.</p>

        <p>Yeah not all people working in retail agree with it most are working while wearing it because they have no choice for their already low weekly earnings that just barely justify putting up with it for a shift. I've been seeing more normal people here lately, it's like we went over that one year milestone and now everyone has had it and it should gradually get better as the initial people start those waves. No one lashing out at the normal people, I think only a couple times from a distance I got a rude comment.</p>

        <p>Oh you're in the UK, I'm in the US.I think here only bigger stores get threats of fines if they don't go along with it and it's the business itself that gets them. I've seen smaller places that never did anything and they're still fine to this day but they're just tiny convenience stores and the gas stations also don't tend to do much besides the plexiglass.</p>
