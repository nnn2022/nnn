    <strong>How dangerous is the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Hello there, and sorry if I wrote things odd cause english is not my first language</p>
<p>I am not part of this subreddit, and usually considered being on the other side of this spectrum, cause covid deniers, etc, usually are nuts to me. And nope i legit dont wanna cause beef here. I was very wary of covid cause I have Asthma, tbh I still am and prolly the fear will never go away cause simple colds already knock me out. Besides that tho, the way this virus appeared was always sceptical to me.</p>
<p>Thing is, I don't wanna live in a echo chamber, and wanna stay informed while staying critical. I never trusted both sides of the spectrum completely.</p>
<p>I ended up here now after reading up on changed DNA genetics, is that true? I have a bit of a hard time with finding articles and stuff. Reading about it makes me afraid tho? My family is currently all preparing for getting vaccinated, but before I wanna do anything I wanna read up stuff from both sides. Cause i am afraid of side effects.</p>
<p>Anyways, I appreciate everything!</p></p>

        <p>I would say the truthful answer is, no one knows. The vaccines have not been around long enough for us to know what are the long term side effects.</p>
<p>As for the short term side effects, we are already seeing the reports of either blood clots or heart related problems (in a small minority of cases). If you are young, with no pre-existing conditions and living a healthy lifestyle, the risks of the vaccine will probably exceed the risks of getting COVID. </p>
<p>If you still feel that you’re at risk because of your asthma, and feel that you must get vaccinated, then do so. However before you do, understand what different types of vaccines there are, and what are the associated risks.</p>

        <p>You should discuss your personal risk factors with your doctor.  Personally, I think the vaccine only makes sense if your over 40 or 50 or you have a risk health condition.</p>

        <p>From Pfizer/Biontech, it seems that the issues are more toward heart problems rather than blood clots. </p>
<p>As for something safe, it seems the vaccines from China are based on traditional technology (that is, the vaccines are based on the inactivated virus). However, it seems that from all the available vaccines, these vaccines offer the less protection.</p>
<p>Personally, if I had to get vaccinated, I would try to go for a vaccine which is based on the inactivated virus. However, I already know that these vaccines are not available everywhere (for example, they are not yet approved in the EU). </p>
<p>Regardless of whether you get the vaccine, I would say that the best treatment against corona is healthy habits. Try to go outside and get some sun (it seems vitamin D plays a role against Corona). Eat healthy and ensure you are getting enough vitamins. Get plenty of rest, and exercise regularly.</p>

        <p>The short answer? Ridiculously dangerous</p>
<p>The long answer?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system could be counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are often reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to this, <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/thousands-of-women-report-hemorrhaging-reproductive-dysfunction-miscarriage-after-corona-shots">the numbers with regard to fertility changes in women</a> strongly suggest that the vaccine has a negative impact on fertility and on pregnancy, which is congruent with <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/05/04/pfizer-confirms-covid-vaccine-shedding-leading-to-menstrual-cycle-disruption-is-possible/">what vaccine companies already knew was possible, even prior to release</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">large study</a> of the “safety and efficacy” of the vaccine has a huge hole in it—they merely vaccinated participants and then hoped and prayed they would come into contact with the wild virus by chance. But there is no guarantee of exposure—far from it—so there is no actual test of safety OR efficacy, when you consider that most lab animals in previous coronavirus vaccine trials (which were systematically exposed to the virus they were vaccinated against) died of ADE, especially if they seemed to develop perfect antibodies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://id.elsevier.com/ACW/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com%2Faction%2FconsumeSsoCookie%3FredirectUri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.thelancet.com%252Faction%252FconsumeSharedSessionAction%253FI2KBRCK%253D1%2526JSESSIONID%253DaaaxMgxF_jwLS9MicyuOx%2526MAID%253DnwtDnnX6yA6uoIcAtieLwQ%25253D%25253D%2526SERVER%253DWZ6myaEXBLF%25252B9vQ18y9JMw%25253D%25253D%2526ORIGIN%253D844971718%2526RD%253DRD%2526exp%253D75icYvzOgUVEevYEfIgkYg%2525253D%2525253D%26code%3Dnull"><em>largest</em> study</a> of the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines also has a glaring problem with it—it does not account for the incongruent testing of vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. The hospitalization rate of the unvaccinated is higher simply because the COVID test for a vaccinated versus an unvaccinated person is different. The one for the unvaccinated uses an <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/Ct_Fact_Sheet.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value between 35 and 40</a>, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">even Fauci admits produces a useless result, that is, a 40-90% false positive rate</a>. The one the vaccinated are given, on the other hand, uses a much more reasonable <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value less than or equal to 28</a>. What this means is that many unvaccinated people are actually being misdiagnosed when they go to the hospital, whereas far fewer vaccinated people are.</p>

        <p>The thing about DNA changes is that nobody knows, not even the creators of the vaccine and the creators of the methodology behind it what effects can this type of vaccine have on our body and DNA in the long term. And only that for me is frightening.</p>
<p>There are some studies suggesting MRNA can change the genome and if so, then, also can the vaccine. But there are no proofs of the vaccine doing that yet.</p>
<p>Even virus change our genome when they infect us, not all the time but they can and have changed it.</p>
<p>I don't mind my DNA changing because of a natural virus, that's just nature and no one was responsible, but if a virus might be artificial or a vaccine makes those changes then I am fully against it. Humans are starting to mess around with very dangerous stuff with still very limited knowledge. It's like playing with shark when you only saw codfish all your life.</p>

        <p>You are saying you have health issues thats why you are afraid of both covid and the vaccine. Just think logically. If your health is that bad and covid is such a scary disease, you would’ve gotten it already when the numbers were up and rising. Scientists are already talking that the covid death rate among vaccinated people is higher than non-vaccinated ones (0,1% on average for non-vaccinated and 0,6 for vaccinated) so why tempt your fate?</p>

        <p>The short answer is that nobody knows yet and that's why we're skeptical. </p>
<p>The long answer is that we're skeptical because of the way people are treated differently. Why were protesters not allowed to express their frustration with the shutdown--but BLM is allowed to block highways for weeks?</p>
<p>Do your own research. Think critically.</p>

        <p>I suggest researching the Spike protein it’s toxic and it’s what the vaccine is causing to replicate in the vacinnated person uncontrolled. That’s what’s causing the heat problems and spontaneous abortions. </p>
<p>Please take a hook at The Highwire and The Defender for science about “vaccines”.</p>

        <p>Not to scare you. But being 100 with you, you are the experiment. We have no clue what the long term effects are gonna be. This thing skipped all animal tests because they kept dying off, no liability if you get hurt or even die, multiple extremely severe side effects, etc,. More reasons if you want but those enough should tell you this isn't something safe. Criminal history of the manufacturers too.</p>

        <p>OP, go onto r/covidvaccinated and r/shingles and have a look at all the people having really terrible side effects and then think to yourself "I've been through the worst of it without dying, so has my family, am I really going to risk taking something that clearly has a great deal of side effects for a virus I haven't heen harmed by at all" then decide for yourself. Best advice I can give you.</p>
