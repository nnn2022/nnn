        <p>Have you ever wondered what happened to those men who signed the Declaration of Independence?</p>
<p>Five signers were captured by the British as traitors, and tortured before they died. Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned. Two lost their sons in the Revolutionary Army, another had two sons captured. Nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds or the hardships of the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>What kind of men were they? Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists. Eleven were merchants, nine were farmers and large plantation owners, men of means, well educated. But they signed the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penalty would be death if they were captured.</p>
<p>They signed and they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.</p>
<p>Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter and trader, saw his ships swept from the seas by the British navy. He sold his home and properties to pay his debts, and died in rags.</p>
<p>Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move his family almost constantly. He served in the Congress without pay, and his family was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from him, and poverty was his reward.</p>
<p>Vandals or soldiers or both, looted the properties of Ellery, Clymer, Hall, Walton, Gwinnett, Heyward, Ruttledge, and Middleton.
At the Battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson Jr., noted that the British General Cornwallis, had taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters. The owner quietly urged General George Washington to open fire, which was done. The home was destroyed, and Nelson died bankrupt.</p>
<p>Francis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed. The enemy jailed his wife, and she died within a few months.</p>
<p>John Hart was driven from his wife’s bedside as she was dying. Their 13 children fled for their lives. His fields and his grist mill were laid waste. For more than a year he lived in forests and caves, returning home after the war to find his wife dead, his children vanished. A few weeks later he died from exhaustion and a broken heart.</p>
<p>Norris and Livingston suffered similar fates.</p>
<p>Such were the stories and sacrifices of the American Revolution. These were not wild-eyed, rabble-rousing ruffians. There were soft-spoken men of means and education. They had security, but they valued liberty more. Standing tall, straight, and unwavering, they pledged: “For the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of the Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.”
They gave us an independent America. Can we keep it?</p>
<p>---Note: some of the information abovechas been questioned by some scholars. There are definitely some inaccuracies. Yet it is accurate enough and I always find it inspiring. Hardships will come during any attempt to alter the status quo.</p>

        <p>Not really, no. I wasn’t able to see my family because of them being on the other side of the country and in the hospital, but it wasn’t really a choice.

        <p>Take a look at r/lockdownskepticism then. Our argument is pretty well fleshed out but this sub is kind of just where we discuss amongst ourselves, tbh. I agree it can be a bit conspiracy-heavy but some of them don't feel like a stretch with what's going on right now.</p>

        <p>Thanks, and you're welcome! There are quite a lot of scientific articles on there, as well as information on the second order effects, and the sub actively avoids conspiracy theories so we don't scare away people looking for information. If you're looking for information on anything specific I'd be happy to link you articles I've saved over the last months too!</p>
<p>Also, apologies I sent you the wrong link. It's r/lockdownskepticism with a k.</p>

        <p>I agree that some things on here are like that, but other stuff is actually intelligent?  </p>
<p>Also, have you checked out r/lockdownskepticsism?  They're a bit less "conspiracyish."</p>

        <p>This is the most recent twitter-zombie buzzword.  Used predominantly by suburban and urbanite Yankees who spent their entire life up until this year trashing "southerners" for the way they talk, and only ever used "y'all" in condescending or mocking contexts until their favorite social media "activists" started using it.  Typically 👏 accompanied 👏 by 👏 this 👏 bullshit 👏.  Bonus points if they write "ya'll" because they don't understand how contractions are supposed to work.</p>
