    <strong>Vaccine enforcement looms closer with each day</strong>
    <p><p>Unless you're one of the lucky few who live in a state that actively opposes tyranny (notwithstanding the best efforts of many), the pressure will mount at a frightening rate now. While venues checking maskless for vaccinations isn't enforceable at the moment (though I've already seen a fair share of propaganda suggesting otherwise to people) they are turning the screws. People will be bullied for 'hindering' parties, weddings, cruises and other gatherings, demonized at their workplaces ('we all have to wear a mask because of you') and ostracized in other ways. No shortage of owned lackeys to fan the flames in-person (just as those who work to manipulate opinion online). And once vaccination rates have reached critical mass, or once there is another 'surge' or two, they will begin enforcing proof of vaccine in order not to smother your face.</p></p>

        <p>Peer pressure is 100% in full effect in eastern Canada, if you did not have the vaccine yet, or even have a scheduled date for the jab, you are tagged as a crazy lunatic.</p>

        <p>That’s the reason for recent guidelines published with number for vaccinated people which is just a bit above what various polls show people uptake will be.
To make sure they aren’t met and you can target crowd anger toward those without vaccine.
Shit, it straight from USSR book about kulaks</p>

        <p>I am in NYC. I have been called so many names this year I am over it. You can call me whatever you want it doesn't make it true. People here are are mentally unstable lunatics. They are terrified of everything. They exhaust me and I have no desire to spend time with people this crazy. I couldn't be around them at this point we would have nothing to discuss if they truly think I am a monster for not getting an experimental vaccine.</p>

        <p>Yeah I don't know. If it's private businesses enforcing these, vaccinated and un vaccinated people need to join forces to pressure these businesses to not discriminate on health choices.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I really don't want the government butting in and making things worse.</p>

        <p>It's the private businesses (the thing it's again coordinated by Bill Gates &amp; "CO.") <strong>and they are trying to influence the Biden Administration into accepting this! They already send a paper to White House 2 months ago. No news about it.</strong></p>

        <p>They are already moving towards implementing an electronic "health pass" and gues who's behind it again? You're right, Bill Gates.</p>
<p>When the pandemic started and figure it out it's Bill Gates &amp; CO. behind it, some seen the connection of the pandemic and his ID2020 - Of course whoever said that at that time it's was "crazy" "conspiracy theorist".</p>
<p>This year, guess what Digital Pass pops-up? </p>
<p>The Good Health Pass. Wow, what a miracle? </p>
<p>And who own Good Health Pass? ID2020 owns it. The global electronic ID project own it. And who owns ID2020? Bill Gates &amp; Rockfeler.</p>
<p><strong>This open letter was send two months ago by</strong> <strong><em>Good Health Pass</em></strong> <strong>to the</strong> <strong><em>White House.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/news/"><strong>https://www.goodhealthpass.org/news/</strong></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Open Letter to the White House</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>On March 15, the Good Health Pass Collaborative sent a letter to White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator</strong>, Jeff Zients <em>urging the Biden administration</em> <strong><em>to establish official guidance for the development and deployment of digital health passes for travel and other use cases.</em></strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The letter offers the Collaborative’s full support and collaboration to ensure that digital health passes achieve their desired objectives – and that they do so while simultaneously protecting civil liberties and promoting health equity.</p>
