    <strong>From a high school senior - I am at my limit</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone, I posted a few weeks ago here and wanted to update. Currently my wack school district in southern NJ flipped suddenly to all-virtual schooling until October 23. Which they "anticipate" will begin the hybrid schedule. I shouldn't even have to say how much of a clown move this is. Their reasoning was to "prepare our teachers and staff for the hybrid environment". So I have to suffer because no one was working this summer and couldn't get it together. Their virtual "learning" has me awake at 7:30 AM and in front of the computer 4 hours a day. Cameras are mandatory to be marked present. No actual learning. Just get assigned Google classroom work on top of being made to sit in "class". I'm fed up. I have no choice and no way out. My family can't afford any kind of alternative. </p>
<p>I'm in the top 10 in my class, taking AP courses, set to graduate with my seal of biliteracy, spent 4 years in indoor and outdoor color guard. Guess what matters now? None of it. No competitions or championships that I spent 4 years working towards. No acknowledgement or fun. I'd bet everything I've saved that this is going to be permanent and I won't get to walk at graduation, have a prom, or have to endure some bullshit "virtual" event. Imagine having your loved one die and someone sending you a cardboard cutout of them and telling you "look! It's all better now! Stop being sad!" Because it's how it feels. It's a complete mockery. Everything I planned for and wanted is trashed so a few teachers can cry online about not being "safe".</p>
<p>Who cares what I'm losing anyway? Who cares about me or my life? If they lost me they wouldn't care. My own mom and brother said I was "bitching" too much about being depressed and that I should just act mature. Everyone I talk to tells me to just suck it up, to get through it. But I can't do it. I'm at my breaking point. I am not strong enough to just let this go by and not affect me and put on a show. There's no way out. Nothing's going to change. In 9 months time where will I be? In front of a screen again. In my bedroom again. Everything that could have been wasted. Nothing to look forward to but pointless wage work for the rest of my life. Maybe I'm not meant to be happy. Maybe I'm not meant to have the things I want and work for. Because every day is more restrictions, more taken away, more missed out on.</p>
<p>It's too much for me. I need some kind of change or way out or agency. Something's got to give. I have been trapped for 6 months and probably for much longer. How much more do I have to miss out on? How much more are they going to take? There's no reason to continue. Nothing to look forward to when there's no definite end date to my suffering. Why do I have to keep going when it hurts too much to be here?</p></p>

        <p>There's no way around it, that sucks.</p>
<p>But, if it makes you feel better, as someone who you will probably think is an Old, I will tell you this:</p>
<p>Anyone who says the best years of your life is now is lying.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a wage slave if you don't choose to. When you're an adult you don't have to give a shit about what your parents think unless you choose to. You have, if you make the choice, decades of travel, of meeting people, of experiencing life and the world and all its richness ahead of you. You could teach English in Japan. You can go on an expedition. You could study university in Malaysia. You could ride a motorcycle around the world. You could move to France and go native. All you have to do is just get though this bit and then you're free. Really. I promise.</p>

        <p>OP: this is advice is true! Especially because you are lucid, bright, and driven. The world is more your oyster than you‚Äôve been led to believe. And you don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs permission to grab what you want in life.</p>
<p>All of this is massively unfair and there‚Äôs no way around it and there‚Äôs no apologizing for it and you shouldn‚Äôt be made to feel you need to hide your grief.</p>
<p>But after you cry it out, look for the silver lining. You have a chance to break the spell early. You do NOT have to march on to (virtual üôÑ) college and then graduate into wage-slavery. See the world, find yourself! </p>
<p>And I say this especially, as a former National Merit Scholar and AP Scholar and college scholarship recipient blah blah blah: consider owning your own business. After or even in lieu of college. They tend to tell the most gifted kids that their gifted-ness means they should just go to an extra fancy college right out of high school. That is NOT your only option. Take a beat and look inside your heart. I wish I had. </p>
<p>Also: start investing in real estate as soon as you can. üòÅ</p>

<p>Isn't that the truth! School, from elementary through college, was an awkward time all around. I don't wax nostalgic over that time in my life. I'm glad that it's over and done. My best years are right now, in my late thirties. Things have continuously improved in my life for the most part, though there have been ups and downs along the way. What a depressing notion to think that once you get out of school, you've passed your peak, and it's all downhill from there to the grave.</p>

        <p>I totally sympathize with you. I graduated high school in June, ranked top 5 in my class. My twin brother was valedictorian, and had to give a pathetic virtual speech. My final tennis season was cancelled. </p>
<p>I thought that college this fall would be better. It wasn‚Äôt, my school tested everyone and locked down the campus. College tennis cancelled. I made the hard choice to defer admission for a year. I‚Äôm tired of this, and I wasn‚Äôt going to let my college force me into debt for that kind of freshman experience. The only way I could resist those restrictions is to not give them my money this year. I had planned on getting lots of hours at my job I‚Äôve had for almost a year. Then the business closed permanently 2 weeks ago because of the lockdown economy! So this whole ordeal has been tough on me and countless other high school and college aged students.</p>
<p>Try to do things you enjoy. I had a great summer hanging out with my high school friends. Playing   tennis, golfing with my dad. Now several of my high school friends are being sent home by their colleges. We‚Äôre going to try to work at the same place, and hang out whenever possible. We‚Äôre making sure everyone we know who‚Äôs fed up with the lockdown is registered to vote. Shop at any businesses near you that is anti-mask. My family buys almost all our groceries at a small family market without masks, for example.</p>
<p>Be vocal about your beliefs. Don‚Äôt be bullied into silence, and letting the mob continue this nonsense lockdown. The only way we‚Äôre getting our lives back is by fighting for it. Do all you can to vote out mayors/governors who are pro-lockdown. Disobey the rules &amp; guidelines whenever you can. That‚Äôs about all we can do. If you ever want to just vent about the world our leaders are leaving for people like us, message me. I totally understand what you‚Äôre saying.</p>

<p>Well said. I feel really badly for the people who are freshmen in college right now, because their freshman experience was ruined before it ever started because of coronavirus-related security theater. I can't blame anyone for deciding to put off their education for a year until this all blows over. I might have done the same.</p>

<p>No offense, but I'm sure that's easy for him to do since you are anti-lockdown/New Normal. Many parents probably aren't allowing their kids to go meet friends or have any sort fun outside their homes. It's probably very bad. </p>
<p>If I was a teen, and had to be under lockdown with my parents today, they would not let me go out at all (I know this for a fact due to their current reactions to the virus). If I attempted to run away, they'd probably beat me up most likely. And with the way things are going, with domestic abuse cases going under the radar or being dismissed by police, I'd have no recourse.</p>

        <p>Yes, that‚Äôs true. In fact, my kids all think I‚Äôm wrong about this and terribly cold hearted about the people who died or could die. I‚Äôm trying to educate them about the many ways the economy affects our quality of life. The conversation always ends in them shaking their heads and walking away. </p>

<p>I'm sorry. The adults fucked this up by reverting to children and letting Mommy and Daddy in the state house take away everything to keep us "safe".</p>
<p>Keep going. We were a tiny minority but we are growing in numbers each day. People are out there fighting to restore your rights and restore some sanity to this world.  We will prevail.</p>

        <p>It probably doesn‚Äôt mean much, but this stranger cares. I am older than you, but I feel so sorry for the young people missing out on their lives due to this bullshit. You are not alone and you are not crazy. If you can at all, start looking at colleges in states with no or few restrictions and keep that as a goal to work towards. Your grades will be your ticket out.  If you can, try and hold on a little longer. Get with friends in person, do what you need to protect your mental health.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry you're going through this. I wish I could give you some advice or words of encouragement, but I'm not sure there is anything I can say that won't feel like an empty platitude. Things are bad right now, and we don't know what the future is going to hold. Matters could improve, or they will worsen. I think the fall and winter will be where things come to a head, personally. For now, just hang in there, and feel free to come vent here if you need to.</p>

        <p>I really understand the hollowness of it; the part about losing a loved one and having them be replaced with a cardboard cutout of them really stuck with me. You are heading down a dark path in life and need to get off.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is get out and meet people, especially any friends you have, if at all possible. Make that your first priority. Second, that high school program is making you miserable so you need to get that out of your life. Proper homeschooling doesn't need to cost much money so I'm not sure what you mean by not being able to afford any alternative, but in any case there are other options.</p>
<p>You should look into a regular early graduation, taking the GED, or simply enrolling in a university or community college directly. As evidenced by all the people who have skipped high school on their way to college, if you have a college degree (even an associate's degree from a community college) no one really cares if you have a high school diploma. I'm not sure if that is an option for you, but if you haven't looked into it already you really should; someone as high-achieving as you could easily clear the academic hurdles needed to graduate early.</p>
<p>Third, getting to an environment that is less restricted, like another state, would probably help your mood a lot, even if it's only for a short time. Try to find some way of getting to a more "old normal" area.</p>

        <p>I care about your loss. Deeply.</p>
<p>I lost my small business in the economic collapse of 2008 and after attempting suicide a doctor said "at least you're young enough to start over, I had another business owner in here for the same thing last night except he's already in his 60s" - I was 28, almost $1,000,000 in suddenly unpayable debt and lost my house and marriage in the process. </p>
<p>Yes, a lot of people had it worse, but I worked so hard on that business and suddenly, through no fault of my own, 90% of my customers couldn't afford my services anymore and I couldn't bear to lay off my employees until I had burned through all of my savings. </p>
<p>Just because it's 'just your senior year' and 'everyone is suffering' doesn't mean this isn't an incredible injustice to you and that it isn't affecting you deeply.</p>
<p>I would like to make a suggestion you might not want to take, but my personal life experience leads me to believe is good advice: look into taking your GED ASAP. You're being robbed of your senior year and you are obviously a more than capable young person, and despite what your public school teachers have told you your entire life, you CAN still get into excellent colleges with "just a GED" - especially these days. Hell, making such a rational choice might even show how much more mature you are than most of your peers that will surely waste this year of completely worthless 'schooling' just going thorough the motions because that's what they thought they were supposed to do.</p>
<p>Hang in there. Things DO get better.</p>

        <p>I would definitely try to graduate early except for my color guard. I still want to at least try to participate because I can't afford to do independent guard. Also my parents aren't going to let me deviate at all from the 4 years high school, 4 years college path. 
Things aren't getting better. They get worse every single day. I barely have energy to do anything but cry and I can't drive yet.</p>

        <p>This guy who lost his business just gave you the best advice in this thread!!!! Get your GED and get college paid for. Don't spend a single dollar of financed debt on college education in this country until this scam is repealed. The very people in government saying " sorry, boo hoo, just the way it is" are the same people that made education debt non dischargeable in bankruptcy.</p>

        <p>The agony you are experiencing is partly due to thinking critically and independently already from a young age despite being among the generation most saturated by media which is largely pro-lockdown. The current situation is no doubt going to be tough but you have to use your gift of actually being able to think for yourself because it will be powerful as you get older. Take the time you need now to grieve for the current loss of opportunities without any embarrassment. It's OK to be upset. It's undoubtedly true the younger generation was absolutely shafted by world leaders' idiocy and corruption. But your trajectory is forward and your abilities are present so you'll be able to continue to where you want to be in time, with the benefit of real perspective. If you can meet friends or socialize with people who are thinking along the same lines, that would be of great benefit as well.</p>

        <p>In high school your friends are largely predetermined by who your family is close to and the people in your classes. Once you get into college or the "real world" you get to choose people with interests closer to you and not just out of convenience. You will get more support as time goes on.</p>
<p>I am pessimistic on the virus hysteria but it will end. Even the "normies" will get past this BS eventually, maybe even right after the election (no matter who wins). At 18 having lived through only 1 major recession it can be hard to have any hope long term. But it will get better and in fact over time it may bring out some positives you couldn't see in the moment. Stay strong, and keep posting here if it helps.</p>

        <p>If I were still in school, I‚Äôd be even more pissed than I am now. So I feel for you guys a lot. That said, nobody is enjoying any of this except the idiot doomers. So you are not alone. I‚Äôm living my life as normally as I possibly can (aka I don‚Äôt wear a mask unless there‚Äôs serious risk of fine etc. In my area, there are no fines, and only my ballet studio is acting like mask dictators.)  I‚Äôve been meeting up with friends and family this entire time and going to any place that is open (even theme parks). AKA try to live as normal as possible. There are some things you still have control of. Take full advantage of it. Living as normally as possible is my way of defying the government and enjoying my freedoms, since I have no idea when the government will choose to rip away more freedoms. Enjoy it while you‚Äôve got it. See if you can get involved in any local maskless protests or groups. I know they‚Äôre not everywhere, but I‚Äôve been doing this and it‚Äôs extremely cathartic.</p>
<p>&rt; Nothing to look forward to but pointless wage work for the rest of my life. </p>
<p>Not true. Focus on education so you can get a good job. Once you‚Äôve got a good job, you‚Äôll have money to do things. I started figure skating and ballet 4 years ago at age 26 and still going strong. It‚Äôs a very serious hobby. 2 hours of skating and 2 hours of ballet class every single day. I‚Äôve jumped up several levels very, very quickly and already at the Intermediate level. I plan to go as high as possible, which takes like 10 years of training on average. You could also travel the world. I did that the first couple years out of college. There‚Äôs tons of stuff to do as an adult. It isn‚Äôt just work, eat, sleep, marry, kids, retire, etc. But having a good education for a good job is critical to being able to afford any dream goals you have.</p>

        <p>You say you're not strong enough but your post actually shows that you have amazing intellectual strength to challenge the fucked up things that are going on in the world right now, even when everyone else is saying the opposite. Don't lose hope and fall into despair because we can easily turn this thing around, all it takes is the will to do so. With every passing day more people are waking up to how this "cure" is worse than the disease, and before long there will be so many people protesting that they will have no choice but to give us our freedom back.

        <p>&rt;Tiger, one day you will come to a fork in the road and you‚Äôre going to have to make a decision about which direction you want to go. If you go that way you can be somebody. You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends. But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments. Or you can go that way and you can do something ‚Äî something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won‚Äôt have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference. To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That‚Äôs when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?</p>
<p>-Colonel John Boyd</p>
<p>Fight with the army that you have.  Not the one that you want.</p>
<p>You have to create a reason to fight and to do what is right.  There is no "waiting for something worth waiting for."  It doesn't ever show up.</p>
<p>You have to make things matter because the journey and the fight are the way forward and they never end.</p>
<p>Learn to love the struggle.</p>
<p>I would suggest reading or picking up the audiobooks for Ryan Holiday's Ego is the Enemy and Silence is the Key, and then reading Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin.  </p>
<p>If you can take the points in those books to heart at this early stage of your life, you will have an huge advantage no matter what comes your way.</p>
<p>And people will respect you for it.</p>
<p>Be a warrior.  Take the first step and your path will open itself up to you as travel it.</p>

<p>It took this SCAMdemic for me to make some serious headway on two prototype toys I originally designed to amuse my son - that turns out might have a business/commercial path in light of the number of his friends and parents who have asked for it.</p>

        <p>Turn your camera on. "Show Up". Then spend every single motherfucking waking minute undermining the narrative. Blow up the communications with your teachers, administrators, local government, and state government and tell them they can all GET FUCKED. They are behaving criminally. Nowhere does it say you can't out together a class action lawsuits with your fellow classmates and sue these motherfuckers out. Fuck 'em, they wanna play adult games they better be ready for adult consequences. Call it your senior thesis and get admitted to law school after this is all over. You'll be miles ahead of everyone who just accepted the narrative.</p>

        <p>I can tell just from how you type you're an intelligent young person. Just being able to see beyond what's going on now puts your leagues above those who enjoy being told what to do.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that once the school year really starts and everyone sees how crappy it is, there will be protests at schools. Maybe I'm too optimistic but I can see there being extreme backlash,especially aimed towards teachers. They, for some reason, assume they are not essential, but everyone else is. Its actually pathetic and really shines a light on who we choose to leave our kids with everyday.</p>

        <p>I offer you this ... </p>
<p>Learn (what you are interested in) for its OWN sake - not because your teachers want you to. Dont focus on trying to get A's and B's, just focus on UNDERSTANDING (and applying) the material. </p>
<p>Truth is, the ones who focus on grades and performance usually end up working for the ones who coasted by on C's and D's but had a passion FOR SOMETHING and the werewithal to put to put effort behind it. </p>
<p>A little off track:</p>
<p>I remember when my 6 year old got a notice from a teacher about not paying attention when she was doing addition and subtraction problems in class. At home he complained that the teacher was boring. So I took out a piece of paper and wrote down 2 x 3 digit numbers and asked him to add it. Then 2 x 5 digit numbers and asked him to subtract it. </p>
<p>He got it right - so I told him - you are ok and dismissed him - and he went back to riding his scooter </p>
<p>Back to the topic</p>
<p>Find something to occupy your time and you will be less depressed because you wont focus or care about the current state of affairs. Do you like to paint?, Draw? Design and Assemble 3d parts? Puzzles, Read ? Video Games, etc etc </p>
<p>Try to get good at something ... and time will fly by. If it can be monetized - you will reap the rewards later</p>
