        <p>There are some good people that don’t believe evil is out there. They are not being given the necessary information to make informed decisions. I’m sure many of us have spent hours tracking down information because we are habitual truth seekers. But, there are innocent, gullible people out there that believe this is safe. I genuinely feel for them. This mother was smart enough to recognize that she made a poor choice. There are many out there still in denial and would “do it again.” I’m glad she sees that it was a mistake and let’s people know.</p>

        <p>I know! The ones that have horrific symptoms and still believe in The Science or are pushing it on everyone (especially healthy children!!) are the ones that really get under my skin. But, I genuinely feel for those that, due to censorship and 24/7 propaganda, made an ill informed decision</p>

        <p>It’s not her fault. Every trusted scientific institution and authority is urging people to get it, and most are too trusting not to. The media is also complicit (doubt you’ll see this story  on the nightly news.) A lot of ordinary people just don’t know because they aren’t allowed to know. .</p>

        <p>While I get your point, I beg to differ. It’s been clear from the start that this whole thing is a sham to anyone with half a brain. We’re over a year into it and anyone who is still buying this garbage is choosing to do so.</p>

        <p>Oh, don’t get me wrong, I do get your point as well. I have little to no sympathy for the obnoxious cultists who try to shame and bully people into complying...but that said, I think you’re underestimating how genuinely stupid a lot of people are. Like my uncle. A goodhearted guy, but he gets all of his news from the MSM, and sincerely believes it. If CNN told him the sky was green, he’d believe it. CNN told him to get the shot, so he ran out and got it. He ain’t too swift, but he’s also not faking it. He genuinely buys into every bit of what they tell him. Before the vaccine came out he was basically in hiding for months, wouldn’t leave his house. I think you’d be surprised at how many people are just actual sheep.</p>

        <p>Because the MSM aren't telling people that. </p>
<p>There are millions of people who think that this virus kills 3%+ of people who become infected. They have no idea that there is virtually no risk at all for young adults and children who do not have medical issues.</p>
<p>You have to put yourself in their heads. The mother thought that her son was at huge risk of dying from COVID-19. The government, pharmaceutical companies and the media are to blame. Not the parents.</p>

        <p>This is my opinion as well. If all you do is read the newspaper or watch TV, you would be convinced the "experts" and doctors knew it was 100% safe and tested. It doesn't quite meet the threshold for ignorance.</p>
<p>Think of how many family members you have who have fallen for online scams, or find shitty info when researching something else like hobby equipment or recipes. I know a lot who don't even do research, they just buy whatever the first thing they see is, even if it's easy to find reviews which prove it's trash.</p>
<p>Those are the same type of people. They don't know how to find discussions and contrasting information.</p>

        <p>Our trust networks are so deteriorated, it's unfortunate but you can't blame a single individual - it's a systemic issue - and we're all built differently, and on different paths in different environments that will expose us to different decision making and reasoning skills and experiences. Many of us have lost trust with institutions - and historically the church was the major institution that provided narrative and guidance. Now many people are blindly trusting institutions that don't deserve our trust, especially because there's no individual trusted individual who has gained our trust through critical thinking - but people like Fauci who have financial interest in the field they work in, and likewise was willing to lie to everyone saying masks don't work; you should lose credibility instantly there regardless of what your plausible deniability excuse for lying is. So then we're left trying to figure out as individuals, as best as we're able to critically think and navigate this complex world, and with limited time, with peer pressure and influences from biased and manipulated media - that has essentially replaced the trust network and meritocracy/hierarchy of competence - the people that we give our attention to are heavily selected for us by people with varying biases and often ulterior motives - even as simple as personal gain by being seen and paid for as an expert; and then we have the masses of "influencers" who can be bought by advertisers - shallow, cheap attention channel for manipulating the masses in more "native advertising" fashion - like product placements in movies but even more subtle and familiar due to the parasocial relationship many of us have with the majority of people we follow (but don't genuinely or intimately interact with) online via different mediums whether live streaming, video, etc.</p>

        <p>Gotta have a little bit, man.  The average Normie has little to no critical thinking skills, and for a very long time, the people on TV were somewhat trustworthy.  Not everyone has woken up to the media BS yet.</p>
