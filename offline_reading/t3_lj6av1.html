    <strong>Why do Australians let their government fuck them so hard?</strong>
    <p><p>Austrailians, your government has been commended for such overreach and overreaction, it's crazy to see people using your country as a positive example. Australia is getting fucked in the ass harder than almost any western country.</p>
<p>Your provinces get completely shutdown over a couple cases. It's summer down under, things should be open. Is this not a major violation of your rights?</p>
<p>Even once Covid becomes a thing of the past your government has set a precedent. They can prevent all travel, arrest you for 'misinformation', put you on house arrest.</p>
<p>I will never look at Australia the same way. Punishing a whole population over a few sick people is insane.</p></p>

        <p>Mate, I live here in Melbourne Victoria and our government fucking us so hard is a goddamn understatement. </p>
<p>The problem is that our police are absolute vile, violent filth. One underage girl got choked out without warning by one cop and I’ve seen many others out in chokeholds, crash tackled, face slammed into concrete, car windows smashed and people dragged out and choked etc. the majority of people want to stand up and a fair fee try but the police here are seriously that violent, ignorant and uncaring. </p>
<p>So America has a bill of rights entrenched in their constitution. Australia doesn’t. However, our constitution does provide that all the laws of the UK apply here and they do have a bill of rights but even if you explain that to a cop, you’re still getting assaulted and thrown in jail. </p>
<p>Not to mention that our federal law overrides state law as per our constitution and there is a bio security law that overrides our state public health law but the cops don’t care, they’ll still crash tackle you and drag you into the back of their divvy van. </p>
<p>America is taught all about their rights and constitution at young ages but we’re not. I’m 24 and never even knew we had a constitution until last year. Our government wants us to be ignorant and not know our rights or the law so they can continue getting away this this shit. And anyone that does stand up and use their rights and the constitution gets labelled all over the media as violent conspiracy theorists. It’s truly authoritarian dystopia here</p>

        <p>But but but... we're the greatest country in the world. Didn't you hear we changed it from "young and free" to "one and enslaved"? Gotta protect old people's feelings from being hurt by the idea that they aren't young anymore.</p>
<p>We have values, mate! The ones that REALLY matter. Dontcha know?</p>
<p>Anyway, joking aside, I more or less agree with everything you said, but it's not just our cops that are shit. Our people are shit. They don't merely not know their rights (of which they legally have few), but they are themselves garbage people without virtues or values. They're more riled up about the closure of bars and brothels than about the abuse of human rights of the average person. Most Australians support the authoritarian lockdowns and in generally are for tyranny so long as it is woke. It's not even that hard to find #StandWithDan trashbags who will act as vile in real life as they do on reddit. And the people who disagree are weak and pathetic. Even the most fringe elements of Australian dissent meekly ask that Dan Andrews voluntarily resign as if the man would do anything to punish himself and as if retiring with his pension is an acceptable punishment for his many gross acts of treason.</p>
<p>Australia sucks because Australians suck. It's a very rare Australian who is worth their weight. And the ones that are would be best served to just leave as soon as they can. I know that's what I plan to do.</p>

        <p>Tell me about it. You can literally stand there and show our cops the law, written on paper and they just ignore it and arrest you anyway. This one bloke recently was asked why he wasn’t wearing a mask and he said he has a medical exemption. They didn’t care. Straight away three cops tackled him down, one had him in a headlock and then he spent the next 22 hours in lockup. 
Australia, in particular the state of Victoria, have the most corrupt and violent cops I’ve ever seen</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, brother. When I saw that one woman in I think it was Melbourne filming the cops coming to her home to arrest her for <em>writing a Facebook post</em> about an anti-lockdown rally, I couldn't believe it. This is supposed to be an advanced Western country? With a tradition of English common law?</p>

        <p>Oh yeah her. A bit north in Victoria in Bendigo or Ballarat (can’t remember which one) and she was pleading with them to not do it in front of her children and offered to remove a post that wasn’t even dangerous or threatening. </p>
<p>Edit - added: it was a post telling people there was a protest and it was under the same lockdown stage as the BLM protest which was gigantic here and was allowed by the police and government to go ahead. </p>
<p>Yeah common law means shit here. Cops only operate off legislation and only legislation that makes money. They ignore laws that don’t make money. The magistrates court also doesn’t care, they just want to make money off people as well. The only way to get justice here is at the federal high court and people just don’t know the laws and their rights well enough to make it there. We pretty much live in a dictatorship run with violent thugs that spend every day extorting money out of people and assaulting them</p>

        <p>Yeah, isolated cases of misconduct among &rt;99% of interactions which go peacefully don't lead a person who isn't delusional into believing the vitriolic nonsense you wrote about police.  Please see a health professional to discuss your delusions, or they will simply get worse.</p>

        <p>Going off your own principle, it’s okay for me to murder someone because it’s an “isolated case”. </p>
<p>I live here in Melbourne and have seen first hand that Victoria police are complete scum. You have a 1 day old account with a clearly randomly entered username so you’re clearly a troll. </p>
<p>Victoria police are known nation wide for being scum of the earth human beings. They’re corrupt to the core. They assault and brutalise innocent people yet the bikies here get free range to sell ice to 14 year old boys without interference from the scumbag police officers. </p>
<p>I can tell you now that if you believe Victoria police aren’t all trash, you’re the deluded one.</p>

        <p>I mean.. americans have "unalienable rights" in their constitution, and yet I can't help but notice they have been seriously alienated.</p>
<p>Right to bare arms? In some states- Nah, lets ban this this and this, permits for that, and if we don't like you then no permit. Right to assemble? Nah pandemic closures all over, you can't assemble there.</p>

        <p>This is the wrong question to ask.</p>
<p>Yes, ANZAC did the reverse Gallipoli and just bent right over and took it up the ass like a choir boy. But we* are only better as a matter of degree, not substance. We just insisted that he kiss us first.</p>

        <p>From covid? Probably better than some for now. Of course, flattening the curve doesn't mean getting rid of the potential cases and deaths, just extending them over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Factor in the increased suicide death toll, mental health crisis, and the destruction of the economy, and you'll be feeling the effects of lockdowns for years. I hope its worth it for you to support that, but it isn't for me.</p>
