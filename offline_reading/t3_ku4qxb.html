    <strong>Lockdown Alternatives</strong>
    <p><p>This is a long one, so brace yourself haha!</p>
<p>I've been noticing the support for lockdown scepticism has been dying recently (or at least it seems to be dying on platforms like Twitter), so I thought I would make a post here and hopefully start a discussion about the alternatives to lockdown. I will lay out my position, but I'm really interested to know what everyone else's ideas are; since the number one attack people use against us is "well what would you do if not lock down", I thought it could be useful to have a discussion about more liberal, viable alternatives.</p>
<p>Also, everything I say below is from a UK perspective, but I imagine it should apply on a state-level in the US, and should apply across Europe.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>My Position</strong></p>
<p>So, the position I have maintained since September 2020 is that we should be protecting those who face a considerable risk of dying from COVID-19 (I will call those people "the vulnerable" or "vulnerable"), but we should be allowing the healthy to live life as normal as possible. I understand measures should be taken in care homes and other facilities, like hospitals, which house people who may be vulnerable and those who work in such facilities should take the necesarry precautions to protect their patients until the vaccine has been offered to all those who are vulnerable. The measures I have set out above should, of course, all be voluntary. If someone who is vulnerable deems it necesarry to see family and risk catching the virus then they should absolutely be empowered to do so.</p>
<p>In terms of testing, I firmly believe the UK's test and trace system has failed miserably, and the German testing system (which was incredibly effective by comparison) proves that mass testing does not make a huge difference since Germany has needed successive lockdowns (note, when I say a lockdown is "needed", I use the word "needed" very lightly). Instead of testing the masses, which is a huge waste of money, we should be spending a fraction of that money rolling out rapid antigen tests to front line workers (and maybe the vulnerable if they want it) so they can be tested daily. I specify rapid antigen because it is more accurate for detecting <em>infectious</em> people, rather than all those who are shedding the virus (which is not a signifier of infectiousness) like PCR does. That and results can be obtained within minutes rather than within days, making it much more effective at detecting pre-symptomatic people; who have a higher chance of spreading the virus than fully asymptomatic people.</p>
<p>Schools and universities should resume face-to-face teaching immediately and students should be allowed to have their freedom back. I honestly think allowing students to spread it amongst themselves at university would be beneficial. Most students live away from home when they are attending university, so they would not become a vector for transmission to vulnerable/elderly relatives. Allowing students to spread it among themselves while they attend university would boost herd immunity and reduce the need for a vaccine (not like non-vulnerable people need it anyway but whatever, it would make herd immunity come about faster).</p>
<p>The main counter-argument I face to this is the following-If we allow the virus to spread uncontrolled (as in among the healthy population) then the prevelence of the virus would be so high that there would be no way of protecting those who are vulnerable. I don't see this as a slam-dunk argument in favour of lockdowns because of the testing idea I suggested. If those who work with the vulnerable are tested on an incredibly regular basis, there should be very little chance of the virus spreading to the vulnerable, despite the level of prevelence in the wider community. I don't seem to be able to convince anyone of this though.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>UK's 3rd Lockdown</strong></p>
<p>Finally, although this doesn't make up much of my argument, I want to talk about the supposed justification for the UK's 3rd lockdown. I feel like this is what has turned a lot of people away from lockdown scepticism because a lot of people now believe there is no other way. This is, of course, the UK's NHS being "in crisis", seeing more patients now than at the peak in April.</p>
<p>Now of course this is a cause for concern but I think it would be sensible to believe that the NHS has prepared for this, and that was one of the main reasons we went into the first lockdown in March, to give the health services time to build capacity. Hundreds of thousands of retired and final-year (student) clinicians were made available to the NHS in March and the Nighingale hospitals were constructed.</p>
<p>So, my counter argument to this is that the NHS sees usage increase into the high 80s and 90s of percentages during the winter every year, and we see headlines like "NHS in crisis" every year. The NHS was nowhere near being overwhelmed in March/April 2021, and is currently seeing about average usage for this time of year. Taking London, one of the hotspots for COVID-19 at the moment, the NHS usage is <a href="https://data.spectator.co.uk/city/nhs">currently at 87.75%, compared to the average (at this time of year); 88.71%</a>. I agree, this percentage is rising very quickly, but here's an idea. All those who present themselves to hospital with symptoms of COVID-19 should be moved straight to the Nightingales if possible, and even if not it should have minimal effect since most population centres in the UK have a Nightingale nearby. Staff should be taken from some normal hospitals to the Nightingales to support this effort, using the extra staff who have returned from retirement in the normal hospitals to treat non-COVID-19 patients since they may be more vulnerable to it. This way, transmission within hospitals (which I believe, currently, is the place where 25% of all infections occur) should be reduced significantly since the vast majority of  COVID-19 patients are being treated outside of hospital where they could infect patients free of the virus.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to touch on the point that comparisons between 2020/21 and 2019 are invalid because beds have been removed to promote social distancing. Surely, if this is the case, then each staff member in hospital has less patients to look after since there are less beds on each ward; making the argument of "the problem isn't capacity, it's staffing" argument less valid (making it completley invalid when we let those hundreds of thoudands returning/new clinicians serve). And since there will be a higher staff-to-patient ratio, it would only be sensible to move some staff away from the normal hospitals into the Nightingales to treat COVID-19 patients, again, reducing the spread in hospitals.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, this has been a long one, but I wanted to make a comprehensive list of all my arguments and counter-arguments from those who debate me. I would really like to hear your thoughts on this issue, what do you all think is the alternative to lockdown; I think this may be able to help a lot of people join the scepticism movement and hopefully persuade others to join too, since as I said, the main argument used against people of our opinion is "what would you do instead?"</p>
<p>Please, feel free to debunk any of the points I have made in this post, I want to debate people about this as I think it will be helpful to our cause if we can kind of play devil's advocate with each other as it will make for better, more convincing debates with lockdown enthusiasts in future.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read and I look forward to reading everyone's suggestions. Also feel free to cross-post this into other communities and share with freinds &amp; family, if you think that might be helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks again :)</p></p>
