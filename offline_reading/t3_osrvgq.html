    <strong>“We don’t want to overwhelm the hospitals”</strong>
    <p><p>Sounds reasonable enough. Obviously it will be blamed on the unvaccinated, but that’s not looking at the bigger picture. The United States has about 330 million people. How many hospital beds? 919,000. </p>
<p>In 1975 back when the population was about 216 million, there were 1.5 million hospital beds.</p>
<p>How many prison cells are in the U.S you ask? 2.6 million. </p>
<p>We live in a country that can accommodate almost 3 times as many prisoners than sick people who need a hospital bed but it’s our fault the hospitals get overwhelmed. </p>

        <p>Those the same hospitals that had all the dancing nurses on youtube and tik tok during the "first wave" when they were supposed to be jam packed?  The same ones with the empty halls, rooms, beds and parking lots?</p>
<p>More likely this is a result of employees fleeing the healthcare biz due to forced vaccinations.</p>

        <p>EXCELLENT POINT. This non-problem “problem” aggravates me.</p>
<p>If my local ICU has 4 beds, the local media writes panicky stories with headlines like “Cases surging, local emergency ward at capacity!!!” And it’s 4 fucking beds. </p>
<p>In Washington State we had a flurry of construction trying to get field hospitals online. They went unused. We towed hospital ships to a harbor in New York that went unused.</p>
<p>I would expect hospital capacity over the course of 1.5 years to evolve in order to mirror the supposed severity of this supposedly lethal virus. But apparently I’m the kooky one? I don’t fucking get this world anymore and I am done trying to justify inaction or blatant lies.</p>

        <p>While I would certainly agree that we did not and are not overwhelming our hospitals in a majority of areas I think that you are leaving out a key consideration. Medical advances have left most treatments as outpatient and that is why there are now fewer beds.</p>

        <p>Yeah if you didn't notice, that was always a lie. They shut up about it right away as soon as they could start blaming people who don't get the Covid vaccines.</p>

        <p>Its quite funny when you suggest "JUST BUILD MORE HOSPITALS" as an alternative to restrictions.</p>
<p>The mental gymnastics people will apply trying to argue this is not a solution / impossible / a bad idea - its Olympics medal winning sometimes.</p>
