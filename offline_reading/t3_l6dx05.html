    <strong>PSA: If you have to constantly remind people that there's a global pandemic, then maybe it's not as severe as you'd like to think</strong>
    <p><p>That's all, carry on.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I guess I should elaborate instead of just making hyperbolic statements.</p>
<p>We all remember the panic shopping. Back in March when things first closed down, my entire neighborhood was dead quiet. I would go for drives and there would be zero traffic, I would go for walks and hardly see anybody. It was actually silent at night for long stretches. </p>
<p>That's the sign of a population that's afraid and trying to take precautions. Because we did have something to be afraid of, something unknown and potentially deadly was rearing its head. </p>
<p>But if you look at the world now, in many places if you take away the masks you wouldn't even notice a change for many things.</p>
<p>And that's why people aren't complying with measures. Because instinctively we recognize that the fear has been exaggerated. Even you doomers are living life more like normal than you'd like to believe, and you're not as afraid and careful as you'd like everybody to think you are. Nature and instinct is a hard to thing to overcome, and no amount of reddit posts will change that.</p></p>

        <p>People like to tell us that things have changed because we have new information. Well it goes both ways. We now know how mundane the virus is and a lot of people have adjusted their behavior accordingly. This is why people are becoming restless.</p>

        <p>Nah now that we know this virus is harmless to most people it’s time to panic. Back in March when it could’ve been Ebola 2.0 (I mean we really didn’t know for a SHORT period of time how deadly it was) no one panicked. Refused to impose travel bans you name it.</p>

        <p>Yea, right around the 20th suddenly it isn't a big deal anymore. CNN removed their death counter that was playing on every broadcast, democrat mayors and governors who previously advocated shutdowns and lockdowns are now saying we need to "open back up" soon, and various other things.

        <p>I mean I'm not surprised. In the beginning a lot of people followed the instructions out of an abundance of caution and because in general, it made sense. "We don't know enough about this virus so we don't want it raging out of control before we have a chance to figure it out." Ok fair enough. Not to mention it had a clear target and timeline - a few weeks to slow down the curve and to protect our health systems. </p>
<p>But then it kept going on, the targets were lost or moved, or changed so often that people couldn't keep up. The rules made less and less sense and seemed to contradict any kind of logic or common sense. </p>
<p>If you're in any kind of leadership position, and you keep coming up with rules that don't make sense while your employees/customers are losing the plot, the worst thing you can do is continue to double down. If you actually wanted to succeed, you would take a step back and evaluate if the rules you are placing actually makes sense. But that hasn't happened. Somehow, instead of better and smarter new rules, we're just throwing more and more of the same onto the pile.</p>

        <p>Yep you got it. Ironically enough it's the cornerstone of science. You're supposed to be skeptical so that you don't end up in these situations where you thought you were infallible. </p>
<p>The other beauty about science is through continued critique we can come up with better and better ways of addressing problems. Which is why we never actually moved past the idea of lockdown - how can we develop a better method if we're not allowed to critique the existing one?</p>

        <p>It's funny to watch people blab on about science but not actually be thinking in a scientific way. The way of thinking is more religious, often bordering on a cult mentality. You can't question it, because dissent is evil. Science is the very process born from asking questions, so without dissent there is no science. Dissent has led to some of our most wonderful discoveries. As someone once said "Science is more a way of thinking than it is a body of knowledge" and that rings true. We failed to allow dissent, and here we are still in lockdowns because we never considered that there might be a better way.</p>

        <p>What's really really scary is that science was able to give us so much of the comfort of our current life exactly because we had allowed it to largely do its business uninterrupted. </p>
<p>However, the events of the last year have started to corrupt the impartiality of the scientific process, and the way that it's trending it doesn't seem like it may be able to withstand it. </p>
<p>And if we corrupt science and turn it into another cult or dogma, we are in for some very dark ages ahead of us.</p>

        <p>That's an...interesting way to interpret it. I wasn't trying to get at anything related to religion, as it is a different way of thinking entirely. Questioning science with religious questions is not the same as questioning science with scientific questions. All I meant was that whether or not these questions are right, they should be asked and explored anyway instead of pushed down, especially when the science on the restrictions is conflicting as it is.</p>

        <p>&rt;Questioning science with religious questions is not the same as questioning science with scientific questions. </p>
<p>Creationists push the secular "theory" of intelligent design, something that (while having no actual proof, no matter how much they insist there is) they are adamant is a legitimate, scientific, and explicitly non-religious alternative to the theory of biological evolution. <a href="https://ncse.ngo/alabama-retains-its-evolution-disclaimer">To this day Alabama schools place disclaimer stickers on biology textbooks.</a></p>
<p>&rt;All I meant was that whether or not these questions are right, they should be asked and explored anyway instead of pushed down, especially when the science on the restrictions is conflicting as it is.</p>
<p>Again this is exactly what <a href="https://intelligentdesign.org/">groups pushing intelligent design argue.</a> "Why is only the accepted scientific "dogma" given credence when we have experts and research for our side too! Both viewpoints should be given equal attention!" Your post parallels other groups arguments claiming that their scientific inquiry is being being pushed down or suppressed in favor of the mainstream scientific consensus (in their opinion, for possibly nefarious reasons), when in reality they have no merit, and if they did then their viewpoint would be accepted as valid.</p>

        <p>The science on the restrictions is not set in stone as we do not have conclusive evidence that they are effective. We are making big decisions that negatively affect a lot of people based on what's largely assumptions. When science is coming up supporting both sides of the argument with no clear direction on who's right, why is only one side acknowledged? This isn't some outlier theory, it's a genuine question on why we're going along with shaky science as if it's proven without a doubt. You can compare it to religious theories all you like, but it's just another way to shut down an argument without discussion.</p>

        <p>If creationists can prove their theories, they have every right to put them forth. It would probably be good for society to have debate between creationists and evolutionists in schools. Kids who were born indoctrinated in a religion would get to see that creationist theory has A LOT of holes in it. When you force people to only look at one scientific theory this can cause people to feel distrustful, like they're having a narrative forced upon them.</p>

        <p>I am all for giving alternative scientific explanations the time of day. We are dismissive of intelligent design theories because of the very weak support they can find in facts or logic, not because they are dangerous or immoral. </p>
<p>Lockdown skepticism is being dismissed on moral grounds, not on scientific ones. We have the science on our side, but it's difficult to convince the public, when the mainstream media has embraced a pseudo-scientific and moralistic approach to the problem.</p>

        <p>Storytime</p>
<p>I was in a health foods store with my two boys today and I was giving my 1 1/2 year old some raspberries so keep him chill and in yh cart while I shop. This super young worker guy comes up to me and says "I'm not sure you're aware, but those raspberries could possibly have been touched by someone yesterday and now you're feeding them to your child and that's how <em>the virus</em> is transmitted. It's not against our store policy, but in case you're unaware...that's how <em>the virus</em> is transmitted" then he turned in his heel and GTFO'd super quick because I'm sure I was staring a hole through his soul with the scowl I had on my face.</p>
<p>Oh really? There's a virus? Maybe someone touched these berries? Oh wow, thanks teenage kid for telling me about this, I had no idea that's how things work!!</p>
<p>A few unwashed raspberries ain't gonna bother me. My kids eat dirt, gum from tables, bugs, gross food found under the couch, etc. This is how they get immune systems. UGH. I wanted to lecture him, but my kids were there so I just said "uh yeah, I'm aware" and walked away seethingly angry. Apparently the teenaged grocer at sprouts is an expert in virology!!</p>

        <p>Good on you. Basic health measures are fine, but it has to be within reason. When I was a kid we went to the forest and picked raspberries from the bush. Unfortunately, it's likely this teenager was coddled by his parents and his teachers throughout his whole life, and has grown up to be a fearful weak person. Not to mention, they are entitled to their opinions, but they really should have no business telling random strangers what to do.</p>

        <p>Seriously! My kids eat much worse things. I just couldn't believe he thought it was a good idea to come tell me how much of a terrible person I am for giving my kid some raspberries...I bet he wouldn't bat an eye at someone giving their baby a bottle of coke or candy. That's much worse.</p>
<p>I feel like as a worker, he doesn't get to tell me his arbitrary opinions. You don't do up to a random stranger and just say that to them. I mean, I guess people do do that lol. It's just not ok.</p>

        <p>You speak to a larger point too. We do so many terrible things to ourselves and to people around us. For example, we know obesity is one of the leading causes of health issues in north america. We're all extremely well informed about this, and we know that parents can often pass on their bad choices to their kids, leading to childhood obesity. But you wouldn't have an employee walk up to you and berate you for buying your kids 2l bottles of Coke and nothing but bags of chips! Even though that's much more well known to cause awful awful problems. And to be honest, I would likewise argue that no store employee has any business telling that parent what to do. But somehow we don't offer the same kind of leeway to the other side.</p>

        <p>Exactly! This is exactly my point. It's so frustrating. I wish I had gotten his name and told his manager because I wonder what other garbage he tells people. Now, if my kid was doing something dangerous then yes, please tell me. If they are breaking rules, cool just let me know. But not for this. Never for this..</p>

        <p>It's all about balance. Nobody is saying you should let your child live and filth all the time, but it's also important to recognize that our bodies have evolved to handle some level of nature around us, and if we try to ignore it we actually end up weakening our body's natural defenses.</p>

        <p>Totally. I'm beginning to conclude that modern journalists and news people have a mental disorder, or at least serious personality flaws. Basically it's like a major case of gossip and attention seeking. As if they absolutely need to be seen and heard and be the ones telling the story... like the ass at family gatherings who needs to run the conversation.</p>

        <p>Was just thinking about this as I drove to get groceries and noticed traffic not at all different from a pre-covid Wednesday evening on a busy street. Nobody is sticking to lockdown orders, nor thinks this is very serious, I thought. And my thought was further validated when I drove past the toboggan hill and it was packed. I mean, packed. I had hope for humanity in that moment. It was glorious to see all those unafraid parents and kids, none of them in masks. Glorious.</p>

<p>Is there a risk with covid? Yes, of course. Should we take precautions? Absolutely. Should we completely rip out our way of life, impose never before seen restrictions, and literally cause people to kill themselves as a result of those restrictions, all to attempt to stop this virus? God no. </p>
<p>The fervor with which we are told that a calamity is happening just doesn't match the reality of what we see.</p>

        <p>We don't have to remind people not to drink and drive right? Not to smoke right? To not use drugs right? To practice safe sex right? To buckle up right? To use good trigger discipline right? Surely we just say it once and everyone everywhere will always remember it and never commit such heinous acts</p>

        <p>You've got a couple of interesting examples there. What's interesting is the examples you used actually elicit very different responses from people. </p>
<p>We all agree that drinking and driving is bad and should be punished. But we don't exactly say the same for smoking. We also don't say the same for using drugs. Safe sex? Depends on who you ask, but we certainly don't make it a crime. </p>
<p>So are you saying that drinking and driving, doing drugs, not practicing safe sex, not buckling up, and not using gun safety are all on the same level?</p>
<p>This is important because many people equate "not wearing a mask" with the level of hatred we give to some who drinks and drives, whereas we don't harass smokers or drug users and call them murderers.</p>
<p>Why don't you pick some good examples that can actually be compared even to each other, before you start comparing them to my point.</p>

        <p>People need reminding that there is a very real pandemic occurring. This is because the percentage of people who are not complying with social distancing measures is too large. If people took social distancing more serious, then we would see few new cases. I no longer keep current with epidemiology, though this is a decent article on this: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19393-6">article</a></p>

<p>Also: any policy that relies on 100% compliance is destined to fail. We have pretty strict no-murder laws, but weirdly enough, murders still happen.</p>

        <p>An ad hominem is not a valid form of argument, does not support a conclusion. </p>
<p>While 100% compliance would certainly be effective -- I'll invite you to argue otherwise -- it is not, necessarily, necessary. Well-tuned models, backed by observed data, indicate that at least 80% compliance with non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures will significantly decrease the rate of infection of Covid-19. I shared a link to one such model earlier in this thread. Further, the same models indicate that compliance less than 70% result in the controlled spread we are witnessing. Whence, it is reasonable to assume that the least effective NPI compliance percentage is between 70% and 80%.</p>
<p>Finally, while this may hurt my argument, you're a fucking moron.</p>

        <p>Funny how everyone says to do that but somehow we don't have any media managing to get footage of these overwhelmed icus. Not even the governments who say they are overwhelmed have any visible proof. Should be easy to come by. </p>
<p>And then their own statistics say that ICUs are about at normal levels for standard influenza season, which is to say they are running at peak, just like they do every year. </p>
<p>Besides I'd be happy to do that, if I was allowed to. Interesting how a woman tried to do that in the UK and got a visit from the cops for it. It was also interesting how she didn't really see any evidence of being overwhelmed. </p>
<p>Finally, I was at a hospital recently. More nurses there than patients. None of them seem too stressed either, they were chatting, cracking jokes, and behaving like normal people do. </p>
<p>Very interesting all this.</p>

        <p>None personally. But I don't pretend to know them (or be one) on the internet for brownie points. All I'm arguing from is my own observations, logic, and common sense. Whether you are agree or disagree is totally up to you, and I respect your choice either way. </p>
<p>I'm sure there must be a way to independently verify the claims of the hospitals though. Otherwise, they could be making up all kinds of things about the state they're in and we would never know! Or if not then we're just going on the honor system, which then we will have to concede is extremely susceptible to bias.</p>

        <p>Figured. I happen to be married to a physician who has seen innumerable people die from COVID. And we have dozens of friends who will need trauma treatment for all of the needless increased deaths from COVID they’ve seen over the past year. So when someone who has no idea what that’s like tries to lecture to them about the “hoax” it’s incredibly offensive since we’ve been terrified for the whole year about him bringing home this illness and killing us both.</p>

        <p>Funny how all the nurses and doctors I know say differently. I wonder who I should listen to- people who experience it firsthand or some guy on the internet who is bitter about being told what to do. Keep deluding yourself and others though.</p>

        <p>Look, you're free to do what you want to do, and you're free to believe who you want to believe. Something tells me you don't actually know any nurses or doctors in real life though. You must be thinking of Twitter. </p>
<p>But I'll tell you this, if you think something doesn't add up, then you're not really being honest with yourself. </p>
<p>Where I am, all of last spring we were told hospitals were on the verge of collapse. They never collapsed. Then came the summer when every day we had warnings about the system being on the verge of collapse. It never collapsed. Then came the fall, when cases steadily started rising. 100, 200, 300. Each new increase was supposed to collapse the system. I stopped counting what the peak was but I think it was around 6,000? Yeah the system was going to collapse. </p>
<p>Somehow it never did though? How weird that is. </p>
<p>And I'll go back to simple proof. Show me photo evidence or video evidence of overwhelmed hospitals and patients being kicked out. And if you won't, I'll have to go by the government's numbers which indicate that hospitals are just fine and within seasonal level.</p>

        <p>yah, thats not how it works. when people purposefully try to ignore that there is a pandemic it doesn't just suddenly make the pandemic go away</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>historically speaking all it has done is lead to MORE DEATHS. but hey guess what? no one cares about you choosing to be ignorant, if you choose that you would rather die rather adhere to basic safety standards thats you risking your own life, but with covid the stupid people around you do make the difference when spreading it.</p>

        <p>I don't think you have a single source for that, at all. The argument doesn't even make logical sense but okay. </p>
<p>I think you missed the entire point. People will naturally preserve themselves when they're in danger, it's in our DNA to do some. We saw people behave this way at the beginning of the outbreak when we didn't know what was going on. The fact that people are now blatantly ignoring things shows you that we don't see the danger anymore. And let's be honest, most of us don't see any danger in it, not even you. </p>
<p>And who said I don't believe in following basic safety measures? Basic safety measures is exactly what I've been following as long as I've been smart enough to do so. I wash my hands, I cover my mouth when I sneeze or cough, I keep my distance from people if I'm not feeling well, I stay at home when needed.</p>
<p>What you're talking about isn't basic. You're talking about extreme. </p>
<p>And at least if the extreme had some effect you could argue that it's somehow worth it, but apparently that's not the case. All you have to do is look at data from different states and different countries - they all follow the same trends assuming they are in the same hemisphere, suggesting seasonal impact. </p>
<p>Not to mention the death trends haven't even really been impacted due to this super deadly virus, that one with a 99% + survival rate (if we're being generous, it's actually way more than that).</p>

        <p>&rt; If you choose that you would rather die...</p>
<p>Yeah, so I had covid, my boss and coworkers had it, my parents, siblings, and all their kids had it, my girlfriend had it, my friend and his parents all had it... Huh, none of us died. We just had a fever and coughed for a week. And then got on with our lives. Maybe no one is "risking death" unless they have a serious underlying condition. Maybe the fact that places like the UK are counting any deaths (regardless of cause of death) in their covid statistics, as long as the victim tested positive in the last 28 days, are severely exaggerating how afraid everyone should be.</p>
