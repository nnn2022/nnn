        <p>Love how the second person doesn’t even live in NY and can’t possibly comprehend how much damage the city is suffering. “I have no idea what you’re talking about but will happily take this time to lecture you on something you are currently experiencing and I am not” is becoming a recurring theme lately. </p>
<p>As someone who usually lives in NYC, your tourism dollars <em>are</em> needed but I wouldn’t spend my hard earned money there at all right now. The city is dangerous and depressing. Save your money and go sit on the beaches of Florida and reward a state that for the most part has had great policies will all the covid stuff (minus the county mask mandates and bar closures recently but for the most part they’ve been better than most places) where you can actually enjoy your trip. Or take a chance and try Mexico because god knows it may be just as safe as NYC right now.    /s.....kind of</p>

        <p>People are trying to justify that NYC isn’t dead but it’s so terrible. Last week I parked literally right near Times Square, you never ever found parking a block away from there   It was dead   People are saying “it’s New York in its natural element”.  LMAO no way. NYC was never meant to be like this hence “the city that never sleeps”.  The rich are fleeing, so the tax revenue will decrease. Now the little middle class that’s left in NYC will have to pay for it It’s disturbing seeing what’s happening in my home city.   Apocalyptic vibes</p>

        <p>Yes. Exactly this. I was there a couple weeks ago, intended on staying but I just couldn’t. Got on the first flight I could back to my parents’ because I couldn’t be there. I walked up 3rd at midnight on a Saturday and saw nobody-no cars, no people-it was eerie. The homeless are getting very aggressive, crime is up, there’s nothing enjoyable to do, and there’s nobody there. The people that left due to covid are now staying away due to violence-my coworkers who are long time New Yorkers are even hesitant to come into the city right now. Businesses are dropping left and right, mass vacancies in apartments. I love the people who try to sugarcoat it and say it has a wonderful energy right now because that’s just insane-it feels like a dead city. It may recover but I think it will be many many years.</p>

        <p>Yea it’s going to take years. I was telling my fiancé that our kids will likely see NYC the way we saw it now and growing up    I think at least 5 years for it to be back.  I remember it changing a little after 9/11 but this will be worse imo.  There will be less and less small businesses in that city. It’s devastating</p>

        <p>I was 24 when 9/11 happened.  In terms of lasting impact on society and the economy, 9/11 was <em>nothing</em> compared to this.  Back then everyone was flipping out because of increased security <em>at airports.</em>  Seriously, people were livid about having to take off their shoes and belt and run them through an x-ray machine.  Meanwhile the rest of civic life more or less returned to normal within a matter of weeks.  The new normal we're experiencing now would have been unthinkable back then.  Enough people would have simply said "fuck you" to force the government to back down.</p>

        <p>Yea downtown was certainly messed up for a while but it recovered.  And the extra airport security is no big deal other than more time. Like no one forces you to fly on a plane and everything.  Airport security was always a thing so whatever. This is just pure insanity</p>

<p>Agreed. What I really find disturbing though is that no seems all that bothered by it. Everyone just seems OK that the state government destroyed NYC. They think it's justified.</p>

        <p>I posted a rant on my Instagram last week after Newsom announced his completely absurd reopening guidelines that’ll keep any meaningful reopening in LA county from happening for a long time and got all kinds of nasty replies from people I know and work with. Literally got responses saying the entire country should be shut down “till we stop the spread of the virus”. </p>
<p>I didn’t even mention anything about masks or anything else “more controversial”, merely that it’s insane that so many businesses are still not allowed to open even with precautions and that Newsom and Garcetti are destroying the state and city. People have gone completely mentally insane over this. And it’s just hilarious that we are the ones being called crazy.</p>

        <p>It's political derangement and political tribalism at this point. It will not end until newsom gets his vaccine from the person he hates so much (President Trump) and his ungreatful butt will never thank the President. Newsoms tribalists do not care that the city is dead or the county is dead. </p>
<p>Federal intervention is the only way and to do so is via the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 because his reopening plan is basically discriminatory against Hispanic and black areas of the state!</p>

        <p>Not the state government, I was referring more to the department of labor and such releasing these stats. </p>
<p>I do know the homeless shelters/public housing are closed/unavailable, I wasn’t trying to debate that, moreso just stating that I’m seeing increased homelessness/poverty etc being an issue now. I‘m not sure of the correlation of that to after the vaccine release. </p>

<p>-Everything remotely fun or enjoyable has been closed and/or put out of business forever, there is nothing to do but wander around and look forlornly at all the things I can't do. </p>
<p>-I can't even do the above without a stupid diaper on my face.</p>

        <p>To be fair, we really aren’t tracked or surveilled here. At least, not well. I’ve been in multiple flights to “forbidden” states and nobody has tried to contact trace me. They’ve mostly been focusing on the small outbreaks from weddings and other big social events that have been cropping up. Which honestly makes more sense anyway. Not that I agree with the contact tracing for a disease that barely kills people and which has better treatment (which translates to less people dying), but it’s not really a police state like Victoria in Australia.</p>

        <p>The problem with visiting NYC right now is if you're visiting from most other states, you are supposed to quarantine for 14 days. My understanding is that they make you fill out a form at the airport where you're supposed put the contact info of the place you're staying at, or else if you are driving in, they have random checkpoints set up at roads and bridges into the city where they make you fill out the same form. I am not sure how much they actually check this though and how much is the honor system? Can anyone with NY connections (city or state) please advise? I actually would love to visit NY (state, possibly also city) near future if there is a way to get around this stupid crap.</p>

        <p>I have a friend who has traveled by plane several times in the last couple months and she said all that happened was she got a call a few days after returning to NYC, but it was merely a prerecorded message checking to make sure she was quarantining and gave a number to call if she needed anything. That’s it.</p>

        <p>It’s super easy to avoid filling out the form for contact tracing on the plane. And even if they make you, it’s also super easy to put information that would make it difficult for them to find you (i.e goof voice number, using nicknames instead of legal name, etc).</p>
<p>As for the checkpoint thing, they don’t have that many officers stationed at those checkpoints so they end up checking maybe 10 cars an hour (out of thousands that pass by). Your odds are insanely good for avoiding the 14 day quarantine hassle.</p>
