        <p>I did not detect much science here, in the sense that it's a bunch of "well maybe we don't know..." while summarizing a few scientific concepts incorrectly and cherry-picking statistics.  For example, he mentions "DNA amplification" in PCR testing.  In theory he's right that that's how PCR tests work, but covid-19 is an RNA virus.  That's a very significant fact, by the way, because that means they're capable of horizontal gene transfer which allows mutations to spread through viral cells very quickly.</p>
<p>Honestly this is just gaslighting.  There are funeral pyres in the street in India and mass graves outside of new york city, so one bar graph *without a frikkin source* claiming that there haven't been an unusual number of deaths in 2020 is dishonest and unreasonable.</p>
