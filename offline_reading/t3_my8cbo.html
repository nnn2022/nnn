    <strong>Vaccinated people seem to be spreading the virus among unvaccinated people and making it more deadly. India had no COVID-19 problem until they began vaccinating people.</strong>
    <p><p>If you look at India, you will see that for a year now, COVID-19 has been no serious problem. The virus has been circulating in this country of more than one billion people for more than a year. Large slums have seen more than half of people develop antibodies. The death toll was remarkably low.</p>
<p>But now, we see that India has a sudden surge in deaths. They went from a hundred deaths per day on average in march, to 2000 deaths per day on average right now. The capital city, New Delhi, is facing a flood of deaths. And importantly, those people being affected now are mostly young people:</p>
<p>&rt;Data show that 48 per cent of Covid-19 positive patients in Mumbai between January and March were below the age of 40, and 65 per cent of newly hospitalised patients in Delhi are under the age of 45, according to the Chief Minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal. In the city of Bengaluru, under 40s made up 58 per cent of infections in early April, compared to 46 per cent at the same time last year, according to figures from Covid19India.org. </p>
<p>You can check for yourself how rapidly this surge in deaths in India took place. You can check the data here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.covid19india.org/">https://www.covid19india.org/</a></p>
<p>There is no COVID-19 crisis in India, until they start vaccinating people. That's when there's a surge in cases. We know that vaccinated people have an increased risk of being infected until some time after receiving the second shot.</p>
<p>And of course, we know that a very respected and accomplished scientist warned us exactly of this scenario. Geert Vanden Bossche warned:</p>
<p>&rt;As mass vaccinaton campaigns have started in the vulnerable populaton, not only vaccinated subjects but also not yet vaccinated younger age groups will become a breeding ground for new infectous variants. There can be no doubt that contnued mass vaccinaton campaigns will enable new, more infectous viral variants to become increasingly dominant and ultmately result in a dramatc incline in new cases despite enhanced vaccine coverage rates. There can be no doubt either that this situaton will soon lead to complete resistance of circulatng variants to the current vaccines. </p>
<p>This is the same problem we seem to have had with Marek's disease in chickens. Marek's disease was originally relatively mild, but when we started vaccinating poultry, the virus evolved and became deadlier.</p>
<p>From 2015:<br>
<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6247/461">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6247/461</a></p>
<p>&rt;Vaccines have saved millions of human lives, but according to evolutionary biologist Andrew Read they sometimes may also cause pathogens to turn deadlier. Read first put forward the theory 15 years ago. Now, in a new paper, he presents evidence that that is what happened with the virus causing Marek's disease, an infectious disease in chickens. Read acknowledges that the effect has never been seen with human vaccines, but he argues that future vaccines that prevent disease rather than infection could have the same effect. Other researchers say that no general conclusions should be drawn from the paper. Even if he turns out to be right, the study offers no support whatsoever for those who oppose vaccination, Read stresses. If "leaky" vaccines are proven safe and effective, they should be used, he says, but perhaps with closer monitoring and additional measures to reduce transmission, such as bed nets for malaria. </p>
<p>The vaccine is injected into your bloodstream and you subsequently develop an immune response in your blood. That protects you from symptoms. However, the virus generally spreads through our upper respiratory tracts.</p>
<p>What we see with PCR tests is that some people have a very high viral load, without suffering symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1385309985148710915">https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1385309985148710915</a></p>
<p>From another study, on tuberculosis:</p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/186/2/290/836015">https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/186/2/290/836015</a></p>
<p>&rt;Of importance, we have shown previously that the upper respiratory tract is in a compartment of the immune system separate from that stimulated by systemic immunization [6], and, although systemic (circulating) immunity can prevent pulmonary infection and disease, it provides little protection against upper respiratory infection [3, 7].  </p>
<p>If we're vaccinating people in a manner that develops systemic immunity, without developing immunity in the separate upper respiratory tract, then it's possible that you create a situation where the virus can continue to replicate in the upper respiratory tract, turning someone into a danger to other people, without suffering from the virus themselves.</p>
<p>I don't claim to know exactly what is happening, but what is happening in India looks very worrisome to me. How do people think it is possible that India spends a year without suffering any severe COVID-19 pandemic, but now that the vaccine has been introduced, there is a sudden surge in deaths among younger people?</p>
<p>If you start vaccinating people in droves and you subsequently see the number of deaths from the disease you're vaccinating them against increase twenty-fold from one month to the next, you're supposed to ask yourself what's going on.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to be a seasonal thing. Neighboring Pakistan is lagging behind much further with vaccinating, they see no sudden surge in COVID-19 deaths.</p>
<p>India was supposed to be developing herd immunity. In February, they found that 56% of people in New Delhi had antibodies. They did not suffer a lot of deaths from COVID-19 in New Delhi. They began vaccinating people in New Delhi and suddenly in april they began seeing a massive surge in deaths, they're now forced to engage in mass cremations of people.</p>
<p>Important to note, the virus doesn't need to mutate to become more deadly. The initial dose largely determines how severe your infection will be. If you are infected with a bigger initial dose, your immune system has less time to play catchup with the virus, so the virus can overwhelm your immune system.</p>
<p>If it's true that vaccinated people sometimes develop extremely high levels of the virus in their upper respiratory tract, then that would also likely translate into a very high initial dose spread to other people. As a consequence, the virus would become deadlier, without having to suffer genetic mutations, simply because its initial dose increases.</p>
<p>My point is, we're using an untested vaccine that received emergency approval. Normally it takes around a decade to develop a new vaccine for a disease. This time, we decided to take a risk and cut corners. What we now see in India is that a population had come close to developing herd immunity, with very few deaths. After the vaccine was administered to people, they suddenly began having a surge in deaths.</p>
<p>This vaccination campaign has been very irresponsible, particularly in a country like India, where the virus was never a real problem to begin with.  In India, diarrhea kills 100,000 children every year.  They had fewer COVID-19 deaths in 2020 than they had children die from diarrhea. This virus was never a serious problem for India until they began vaccinating people, but now it has turned into a serious problem.</p></p>

        <p>India was doing well with the virus.</p>
<p>Then, they started vaccinating in January.</p>
<p>Now, their numbers are skyrocketing.  </p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>I've shown this to multiple people, and they say, "well that's because of the variants!!  See!?  We need to lockdown more and get the vaccine faster!!  Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!"</p>
<p>I can't believe how naive people are.  </p>
<p>I suggest, "well, maybe the variants came <em>because</em> of mass vaccinations.  Similar to, oh, exactly as Dr. Vanden Bossche was describing three months when you called him a 'Conspiracy Theorist'."</p>
<p>This is usually the part when six people jump in on the conversation and derail it with personal insults and memes.  Anything to not allow the point to be made.</p>
<p>These people are insane.  This needs to stop.  Do not trust these people for a second.  We are being lied to.</p>
<p>Most importantly: Never forget what they have done to us and to our society.  Never forget.</p>

<p>Tangential to the main point, but don’t phrase it like this. India suffered less from the virus because they have a much younger population, more people employed in outdoor physical labour, and a 5% obesity rate as opposed to the United States’ 36%. The death rate of an endemic respiratory virus isn’t a matter of success or failure.</p>

        <p>I’m not arguing against your main point about the vaccine - I really don’t know enough about it to say. I’m saying that India wasn’t doing “well” or “poorly” beforehand, any more than any country was, because the prevalence of a respiratory infection isn’t a moral thing. It’s based on demographic factors within the population, not decisions made by the state.</p>
<p>Although on that note: all the data suggests that the brutal, Partition-esque government “response” did nothing but harm, for reasons other than the virus itself.</p>

        <p>One interesting thing I heard about India early on, and why numbers were so low despite millions living in slum conditions in impossible settings to social distance:</p>
<p>Their diet.  They have curcumin in many of their dishes in turmeric.  This is also an anti-oxidant which helps maintain the immune system, and helps with Vitamin D absorption.</p>
<p>Indians don't have a Vitamin D deficiency problem like we do here in North America.  They also don't have an obesity/diabetes 'epidemic'.</p>
<p>These factors almost certainly helped to keep case counts low in the beginning.</p>

        <p>Easing of restrictions and complacency could be a big factor. I think there were also large festivals recently - so high density gatherings.</p>
<p>This accelerates spread, which overwhelms hospitals. As soon as your hospitals are overrun - you lost control. This is what we now see. People who need immediate help through ventilators - can't get it because the country doesn't have any more. Or hospitals run out of oxygen for the ventilators. People die very fast when they can't breathe.  </p>
<p>With strict measures, hospitals could keep some control.<br>
Ease these measures in a high-pop-density country like India and you get this. Imagine what an Indian train looks like during the week. Now add to this a virus that spreads so easily.  </p>
<p>This is what China would be if they didn't have gestapo-tier measures in place and society trained to obey directions.</p>

        <p>Phased easing. Which made things worse and worse - gradually. Crowded festivals was the spark.  </p>
<p>If vaccines were causing spikes, we would see this globally but what we see is countries that have eased restrictions being hit while those that kept restrictions in place - did not have a spike.  </p>
<p>Look at Ireland or UK for example. UK especially - crazy amount of vaccines (60% of pop is vacc'd) where is the spike?</p>

        <p>I think the vaccines created the variants like Geert says, but the vaccinations in India aren't causing the virus to spread more. </p>
<p>If this was true, why aren't cases going up in the UK or Israel? Most countries in the world are involved in the mass vaccination campaign. Cases are rising in some countries, like India... but they're falling in other countries. So if you think the vaccines are causing cases to skyrocket in India, then why aren't cases skyrocketing in every country that is vaccinating?</p>

        <p>I'm not sure the vaccines are causing more cases.  But then, if we're using the same logic, we don't know if they are preventing them either.</p>
<p>My guess is the general overall health of a population has more to do with cases and deaths than anything to do with vaccines.  Things like nutrition (the aforementioned curcumin) and lack of obesity are big (pardon the pun) clues.  </p>
<p>My guess is this was why the reason for the relatively low case counts in India in the beginning.  The vaccines causing more virulent strains the reason for why it is killing people now.  They haven't prevented the crisis, they are actually creating it.</p>

<p>My guess to your question would be many people in the US and UK had already gotten it and had developed some kind of immunity.  They were already on their descent when the vaccine was introduced.</p>
<p>I don't think the vaccine produces infection.  But mass vaccinations may lead the virus to mutate into more virulent strains.  For almost a year with this virus we didn't hear anything about different strains.  Since we've started vaccinating, we keep getting new strains.</p>

<p>Because only 1.6% of India has been vaccinated. These sorts of numbers are exactly why countries have taken significant steps to stop full blown healthcare system collapse. India is the new case point on why doing nothing isn't a viable option.</p>

        <p>The 2nd and 3rd waves in pandemics have always been the worst. The death toll from the Spanish Flu didn't peak until a year after it started, the first wave in 1917 was much, much smaller than 1918. It's coming into winter in India which has historically been the worst season for pandemics and transmissible illnesses in general. This pattern is right in line with previous pandemics. This time last year India also had widespread lockdowns and travel restrictions which didn't happen this year which would have helped control the spread.</p>

        <p>&rt;In Canada in 2018 we had 18,000 deaths classified as "chronic respiratory disease".</p>
<p>Chronic respiratory disease isn't <em>a</em> disease. It's a class of disease. Asthma is a type of lower chronic respiratory disease, for example. Or COPD. </p>
<p>In 2018 and 2019, and the decade previous, ~12,000 people died of CRD's. The number is pretty stable. The total death numbers fluctuate a bit more, around the 250-280k mark, which makes CRD's approximately 3-5% of total deaths per year. 
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310078201</p>
<p>In December, 2020 in Quebec there were 1465 deaths in total. 4% of that is around 58 CRD related deaths. The number of CRD deaths was 55, well within what would be expected on a standard bell curve distribution. During the same month there were 215 covid deaths completely unrelated to those CRD diseases which were still counted.</p>
<p>Ontario, 2395 total deaths. 50 CRD deaths, 115 covid deaths.</p>
<p>British Columbia, 915 total deaths, 20 CRD deaths, 95 covid 19 deaths.</p>
<p>https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310081001</p>
<p>The stats don't back up what you say at all. CRD death counts are still well within previous years and covid deaths are counted completely separately. There is no sign of this absence of CRD deaths that you allege. Believe it or not, people would notice that. You just have no idea what you're talking about.</p>

        <p>Because those deaths are counted as both now.  Remember how 94% of deaths attributed to covid had on average 2.4 co-morbidities?  Those are just the same people counted in two different categories.</p>

<p>No they aren't lmao. They're clearly separate stats, I just linked them. Just because you keep saying something doesn't mean it's true. These are causes of death, not comorbidities. The "stats" you're talking about don't exist, you're literally just making shit up you fucking ignoramus, You have zero understanding of what you're even talking about. Go get an education you dumb fuck. Or, at least, stop lying about shit when you clearly have zero idea what any of these words mean</p>

<p>We're looking at the same stats.  I understand what you are suggesting.  You don't seem to realize one person could count in both categories.  Or that a person could count in one category one year, and a different category in another, depending on the definition of that death for that year.</p>

        <p>It’s almost as if people’s behavior has an effect on the spread of the virus, and people in India were behaving in a way that contains COVID!!</p>
<p>If the vaccine made people more infectious, then Israel would be awash in the virus, but they aren’t. India on the other hand has not vaccinated much of its population (see https://www.thehindu.com/data/covid-19-vaccination-rate-falls-sharply-in-mid-april-in-india/article34401369.ece)</p>

        <p>Yes, that's my point. This is an experiment, and you can't reach the conclusions with the data as of now. If you take the data as of now, vax show reduced rates. But, this is not taking in account the change in weather, the lack of social gatherings....etc. when variables are accounted for, then you can deduce whether the surge in inda is due to vax or not.</p>

        <p>I wasn't saying it necessarily is related to the vaccine; although that is certainly a suspicious, and bang on the money what Dr. Vanden Bossche hypothesized.  </p>
<p>But also, have vaccines lowered rates?  I was reading just this past week cases in the United States are as high as ever.  That was in CNN of all places.</p>
<p>https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/20/health/us-coronavirus-tuesday/index.html</p>
<p>They blame this on people not following the rules without any data on that hypothesis, which is complete speculation.  It could as easily be due to vaccines.</p>
<p>All I'm saying is, we're vaccinating, and numbers are going up.  Ontario is a great example.  About 4 million people have been vaccinated in Ontario, a province of nearly 15M.  We've been ramping it up since January.  But now we're getting the highest case totals and hospitalizations ever.  </p>
<p>One would think if the vaccine worked, numbers would be going <em>down</em> as we eliminate more vectors of transmission.  But if fact, the exact opposite seems to be happening.  </p>
<p>Again, the only explanation I've heard is "people aren't following the rules".  But we all know that's total bs.</p>

        <p>You can get all the data you need within a certain error margin from any reporting organization. </p>
<p>The one I am referring to is the testing by state found as an API. Link below

<p>And I dont 'believe' the data, or 'trust the science', those don't make sense in science. Science is being skeptical and asking questions. As a scientists, I see supporting data, and then I can draw conclusions.</p>

        <p>I’m going to go out in a limb here and say, the companies making vaccines did not give the best doses to India. If there even is a “best dose” lol, considering this is all experimental to begin with my guess is the first batch went to third world countries to “see what would happen”</p>
<p>I have semi Indian heritage, i know it’s a land of long health where the elders live over 100 by eating natural foods not processed shit. Giving Indians western medicine, when so much of their medicine is bound in nature will weaken them and make them more susceptible to the virus for sure.</p>

        <p>Yeah, no shit they weren't. But the people who conducted those experiments lied and said they were. There's no reason to believe medical ethics has magically improved in the past 50 years. Which brings me to Bill Gates, why the hell should I believe an avowed proponent of eugenics, a man who built his fortune by being a cutthroat monopolist, has no ulterior motives in his 'humanitarian' foundations?</p>

        <p>Yeah, medical ethics has improved so much medical professionals are pushing puberty blocking drugs on children because they might be 'confused' about what gender they are. John Money would be proud.</p>
<p>As for source on Gates' eugenics ties, his father was literally a member of a eugenics advocacy group. He's also gone on record saying he believes the world is overpopulated. Now, I'm not saying he's setting up clinivs in Africa to overtly poison them, but he has made statements on how changes in living standards will result in a reduced birthrate. You'll have to forgive me if I don't buy into the supposed benevolence of his deeds.</p>

        <p>I mean, some places are overpopulated and just because somebody's dad was part of a group doesn't mean they are. Plenty of peoples dads were in the KKK, doesn't mean they are racist themselves.   </p>
<p>And no doctor is pushing hormones on kids. Thats just not a thing. It sounds like something conservative media made up to make people scared of trans people.</p>
<p>Kids getting hormones to conform with their brain chemicals is a touchy subject we haven't really fully explored yet. But no doctor is doing what you say they are. Its just complete fabrication</p>

        <p>This is an important point to keep in mind when we are discussing "the vaccine." There isn't just one vaccine. There are several, and they work in differing ways. Different countries and regions have access to different ones. It looks like India has Sputnik V, Covishield, and Covaxin.</p>

        <p>I have a hunch, and I make it clear that it is a HUNCH, not to be "sourced" or "cited" just mere gut instinct. Well, really, it's a twofold hunch.</p>
<p>I think one of two scenarios is most likely: </p>
<p>Scenario 1 is where the vaccines ARE actually fully, completely effective, but just not for what we know as COVID19. They had to have known that only about 1/4 of the population would willingly get it... so develop a really incredibly deadly and terrible geoengineered disease (some flesh eating shit or something), then preemptively vaccinate your minority obedient population BEFORE you release it, because once it is released it would be game over FAST.</p>
<p>Scenario 2 is slightly less conspiracy theory-ish sounding in my opinion at least. It's where the vaccine is just what they say it is: something that doesn't stop you from contracting or spreading the disease, but mostly stops you from suffering any symptoms. In that case, I see those vaccinated people becoming incubators for much more aggressive mutations which would be even more deadly to unvaccinated people. If a virus is mutating to give someone <em>with</em> protection symptoms still, it follows that it would give even deadlier/more severe symptoms to the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>All of this flies in the face of what I have always known/believed about all previous vaccines. They have always been poison concoctions full of neurotoxins and just generally gross poisonous shit. Aluminum, mercury, pigs blood, dead baby tissue, the list goes on... why would they suddenly make a vaccine with the purpose of NOT being poisonous if that is the case?</p>
<p>Well, it feels to me like they are really trying to do an "all in" end game push here. These are unprecedented times, and if they CAN succeed in killing off most of the population as they have been saying they would like to for decades, then it won't matter whether or not they were "right" or "moral"... fact is they would be the only ones alive, so they feel they would not have the need to feel any remorse.</p>

        <p>My only question is are the "elite" really getting the vaccine too? If the vaccine actually ends up killing off people and making the disease more deadly to the unvaccinated then how can they be sure they wont catch the more deadly version? Is this why they still want the vaccinated to wear masks?</p>

        <p>Your one person tho. And I believe the vaccine will respond well to Covid but its other viruses that it hasn't been programmed to respond too. And Bill Gates said more viruses are coming. If every person died off in the first month of the vaccine it would be too obvious.  The ones dying right away most likely had health problems to begin with.</p>

        <p>I think that Gates means that pandemics will always be with us and that they might become more frequent in a world undergoing climate change. As in, perhaps more than about once per century as we’ve been seeing.</p>

        <p>Also, there are untold numbers of those of us who contracted Covid-19, got through it, and developed an immune response. We contribute to the "herd" immunity society seeks, but, unfortunately, society has recently been advised by the WHO et al. that we still need to get vaxxed.  That directive goes against millennia of basic immunological truth: After recovering from disease, the body retains immune memory of it. T-cells will once again activate to enable antibodies to replicate in response to exposure to Covid-19 again. We are immune. The Covid-recovered are being ignored. We are leading the way to herd immunity, but the powers-that-be do not want to admit it.</p>

<li>
<p>Missing killer-anti-bodies -&rt; inflammation <br>
For the vax to work it needs to program the immune system to make
two types of anti-bodies. First it makes the marker-anti-bodies, and secondly the killer-anti-bodies. If the victim only has the first anti-bodies the immune system will detect the virus and also ignore it. Because it assumes that the killer-anti-bodies are present. This can give huge inflammation, before which the virus has a lot of opportunity to spread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No T-cell immunity -&rt; more spreading<br>
T-cells attack the virus when it enters the lungs. So it can prevent the disease from spreading into the body, and outside into the air. The vax stops the T-cells from working, because it only uses antibody protection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vax during disease -&rt; More variations<br>
If the vax is in a body that is still sick and still producing viruses, 
the viruses have more chance to mutate to a variant that can
avoid the anti-bodies. And the vax makes it harder for the immune
system to spot variants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vax is now the disease.<br>
The side-effects are very similar to the disease (or worse), but
big pharma claims that it is the disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vax makes people sick and/or superspreaders<br>
The vax makes the immune system focus completely on anti-bodies. 
The anti--bodies can cause inflammation, and not even protect the
groups that it is supposed to protect (like it does not work above 80).
Also the virus might not even be defeated completely with anti-bodies 
as it may lurk in the lungs or nose and such. Turning vaxed people
into super-spreaders.</p>

        <p>One of the guys I know, his father, fully vaccinated had low oxygen and 104 fever and cov+. He is confused. People are dropping left right and centre. Something triggered, something went off. They have had massive political and religious gatherings, no one reported Covid or Covid spike in those areas.</p>

        <p>It's because the shot produces fully functional spike proteins in your body at the level of a massive covid infection (as opposed to if you catch it naturally and it has to ramp up, giving your body the chance to fight it when it's still mustering force.)</p>
<p>The spike protein itself was responsible for a lot of organ damage in the lungs, digestive system, brain, nose and other places with ACE2 receptors, because it bound with them and messed them up.</p>
<p>That's still happening when you take the shot.  There's no reason why it wouldn't.  You are just missing the effects of the covid viruse caused by the other proteins, but you are getting an immense infection from the spike protein and they were a huge player themselves in the symptoms of what we know as the virus.</p>

        <p>One thing I am noticing is the symptoms of the vaccinated seem to match a lot of the Covid cases, spike proteins screw you up with covid and also screw them up from shot. </p>
<p>The spike proteins I believe are going to kill all these people. Their bodies are probably still all producing them.</p>
<p>of course they could be lying about India. Anyone from there to tell us how many people are dying of Covid?</p>

        <p>I know that people seem to be falling sick as a close friend's family is in the hospital. Their doctor advised them to get themselves admitted asap. </p>
<p>It's still the tier1 cities that are worst affected. Bigger hospitals, larger Middle class population. 
An angle that is not covered here is that healthcare industry is no angel here. Just a bed in a shitty hospital can cost you $200 per day. </p>
<p>I know how much money a few of them made last year taking advantage of this and one could assume they are just trying to fill their pockets.</p>

        <p>The Salk Institute just came out with a study that does not look good for the vaccination drive. It found Covid-19 to be a circulatory disease, not a respiratory disease, and it studied just the spikes themselves which proved to be capable of a lot of damage to the human body. What are they injecting people with?... a template for the body to create spike proteins ... <a href="https://www.salk.edu/news-release/the-novel-coronavirus-spike-protein-plays-additional-key-role-in-illness/">https://www.salk.edu/news-release/the-novel-coronavirus-spike-protein-plays-additional-key-role-in-illness/</a></p>

        <p>Same thing happened in Cambodia and Qatar, where cases were low to zero, and exploded shortly after vaccinations started in earnest.</p>
<p>Now it can be noted that countries that vaccinated a lot, like Israel and the UK, saw cases drop heavily. Singapore, which started vaccinating but has next to no local cases, saw no increase at all.</p>
<p>Either way this is just the beginning. Either the vaccines work, in which case Covid should be over soon. Or more likely it turns out the vaccines just causes the virus to mutate into a more contagious version that overcomes the vaccine (as Israel says is the cases for the South African variant), and those vaccinated will be infected within months.</p>
<p>On top of that there are the risks of the vaccine itself, which is to say horrible long term side effects (genetic damage, birth defects in newborn children, cancer, death...).</p>
<p>So mask up and social distance from those vaccinated, refuse them service and jobs until we can be sure these experimental injections are safe. They are killing grandma with their selfish behavior.</p>

        <p>The vaccines in India are different from the ones in Singapore and Israel. </p>
<p>Singapore and Israel took the gene therapy Pfizer Moderna crap. They will get ill later, not now. Some will drop dead but most will be fine in the short run. </p>
<p>India took the AztraZeneca one and a local one called Covaxin pumped full of a super high dose of toxic aluminium, which will just make them sick like Covid right away. High fever immune overreaction.</p>

        <p>Sorry, but the numbers coming out of India are almost as useless as from China. There's some 200 - 300 million people living in slums and shanty towns, not to mention thousands on the streets. Nobody are going to do statistics or verify who dies of what.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the infrastructure for the middle class is not exactly prosperous and well organized either. If you think the US health system is marred with irregular reporting, turn that up a ten-fold.</p>
<p>There's absolutely no way any of their statistics about infection rates, death rates have anything to do with reality. To the point where it's meaningless to discuss or analyze it, just as referencing anything about covid coming out China was just pure nonsense and fiction.</p>

        <p>There is no more evidence for this than there is for masks or lockdowns working. PCR is fraudulent and generates useless junk data.</p>

<p>About 25 people in my close-knit community, including me, caught it in December-January of 2021 and did just fine. Two of them had pre-existing comorbidities and had to go to the hospital for a few days.</p>
<p>The rest of us were up and running in about three days. For me, it was like a flu I had gotten two years ago, only Covid was much more mild than that flu. It was more of an annoyance with a bad headache and a low-grade fever with some scratch in my throat for a few weeks afterward. No breathing issues at all.</p>
<p>You could get a blood draw to find out if you actually have been exposed. The specimen would show antibodies and/or T-cells for Covid-19.</p>

        <p>Actually the AstraZeneca vaccine used in India was manufactured in India itself and India also donated these vaccines to several other countries like Nepal etc. The vaccine may have been halted in some European countries but if I'm not wrong the majority of the vaccinated UK population has received the same vaccine</p>

        <p>Honestly, this is a very interesting point of view which may very well be true to the sudden surge in India. However, I'm curious as to why the same hasn't happened in USA, Israel and the UK who have vaccinated much more of their population than India?</p>

        <p>They probably have different batches. They have put in alot of effort to get all ethnicities to take the vaccine knowing all wont. I think they have certain percentages in each country they are planning to keep alive.</p>

        <p>Holy shit, I was reading about the theory on one of the conspiracy subs of pretty much the exact same thing with Mareks disease and chicken. If it was possible in the past, who is to say that it wouldn't be now? All the vaccinated people will be able to travel again and spread it worldwide. If that's the case, then it is a true evil masterplan. Just more and more confirmation bias. </p>
<p>OP, what do you suggest the unvaccinated should do if their friends/family members are vaccinated if that's ultimately the case?</p>

        <p>I agree with your suggestion. It is hard to say if it's true or not, I believe only with time and closer observation we would be able to know. I have also been hearing from a lot of ER nurses that lots of patients coming in with covid into the hospitals are the ones that have already got vaccinated, so by the numbers of covid cases or deaths it's really hard to say if those are more the people that have gotten the vaccine or haven't or maybe just a combination of both.</p>

        <p>There are a whole lot of unvaccinated who are also Covid-recovered. They should be fine. It is an all-over immune response, not just a response to the spike protein. That should at least take care of the Covid-recovered-non-vaccinated. I would say, in any case, do not treat your family/friends any differently after they've been vaxxed. Love them. They are your family.</p>

        <p>No, you have it wrong. India locked down, which all that does is push the burden of the disease on the poor. That is why the slums had 50% infected. deaths were low because those in Indian slums are not at all high risk of coronavirus. The richer, older population in India started getting coronavirus recently, all at the same time, which lockdowns were intended to protect against. Which is why we are seeing the insane spike we’re seeing in India. </p>

        <p>I don't get it. They are reporting 50% positive test rates in some parts of India. I don't trust the tests at all, but let's assume they're right. Even if they're only testing people with symptoms, let's say 30% are positive in a given population. That would mean, within 3 weeks or so, the virus would completely run out of hosts to infect.

        <p>From what I have heard from friends and family in Michigan, there are a lot of milder cases among young people, and the life-threatening cases that I have personally heard about are slightly overweight men in their 50s who were unvaccinated, and unvaccinated pregnant women.</p>

        <p>yeah Michigan is a nightmare and I think the vaccines aren't working too and ADE [google Bossche] has already set in. I am noticing on the Covid vaccine boards the people on them are talking about having been sick for more than a month and those posts are far more common with life altering levels of illness.</p>

        <p>A good post mate. I suppose you start to see the reality of choices unfold when you have the hindsight to see all that’s happened.</p>
<ul>
<li>mass vaccinations and alter the potential for a higher death toll, accepting it won’t be a perfect process and will likely need annual vaccination </li>
<li>accept the virus as it is and accept an initial high death toll, perhaps greatly increasing variant and mutations, or even drug resistance? Basically, leaving it up to chance.</li>
</ul>
<p>History will look back on the decision and might not favour the outcome, but will almost certainly not favour inaction and luck.</p>

        <p>So, I would be careful about making any assumptions this early.</p>
<p>India has around 28,000 deaths per day on average, right now covid is apparently causing around 10% of that.</p>
<p>The US has around 7700 deaths per day, and at peak covid was said to be causing around 50% of that number per day.</p>
<p>I suspect you are right and the vaccination graph for India looks a lot like the death graph and the fact that 48% are beneath the age of 40 - compared to Canada where less than 1% of the deaths are below the age of 40 - all point to you being correct.</p>

        <p>I'm sure the spike has absolutely nothing to do with Modi telling people corona won't come to the places that vote for him and hosting public rallies combined with religious holidays which include throwing feces at each other and bathing in the same water that they dump their dead in. No no no, it has to be the vaccine lol</p>

        <p>Indian here, to simply put people in India got cocky and have stopped wearing masks when going to public places. Since we were doing so well in terms of mortality rate and infected cases per day, people decided to pretend that the pandemic has magically disappeared. I've had people laugh at me on the street because I was wearing a mask and gloves while going to buy groceries. Up until now people above the age of 60 were allowed to get vaccinated it's only since the past 15 days that the people above the age of 45. The government recently announced that the age group above 18 years will be getting the vaccination from 1st of May. Let me tell you something about this age group, the majority of India's population is compromised of this age group. Not to mention the youth has their head stuck so far up their asses that they are completely refusing to take any precautionary measures and do as they please. </p>
<p>I see kids playing without their masks, people going to malls in order to not miss out on end of season sales. Visiting soical gatherings despite being a "little" under the weather. Using chiffon scarf as a mask because the N95 masks aren't pretty enough 🙄. Not changing their clothes once they've come from outside. Convincing others that covid is fake. All of these and many more of such stupid reasons have led us to where we stand now. The government had to impose a total lockdown again just to keep people in their homes. My neighborhood is very safe and on normal days we don't need any patrolling but now there is police patrolling 4 times and day so that they can keep people of the streets. Bottom line is, its not because of any political reasons or because the vaccinated crowd is transmitting it to other people. The spike in cases you see is only because people have become extremely careless.</p>

        <p>As per the official data only 14,19,11,223 vaccine doses administered as on 26-April. Even in this there is no clarity on first or second dose. </p>
<p>This is just 10% when compared to the massive 140+ crore population. </p>
<p>Can this 10% infect the remaining 90%, I don't think so. </p>
<p>Whatever it is just stay at home and follow all precautions to stay alive. </p>

        <p>I was wondering what you all were thinking about all of the tragic deaths and overwhelmed medical facilities in India.  I really should have known that it would be blamed on vaccination in a country that has vaccinated a tiny percentage of its over 1 billion people.  It couldn't possibly be the change in behavior, large gatherings, and power of exponential growth.</p>
