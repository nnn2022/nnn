    <strong>Really lost my respect for doctors and healthcare workers.</strong>
    <p><p>Recent events, especially this whole meme virus really and doctor's responses to it have made me lose respect for them. Blatantly lying about mask being effective when they know they aren't. Not giving clarity about vaccines. Saying you need vaccines on one hand and then saying you can still get the meme virus and spread it even if you're vaccinated.</p>
<p>Update : So a couple of responses from healthcare workers. I understand many of them don't believe this bs. My rant is mostly targeted at the one's who are actively participating in this and propagating it. Especially the celebrity doctors who come on news channels and talk shows.</p></p>

        <p>Yep.  There are a lot that know it's bullshit that aren't speaking up either.  Yes they are protecting their jobs but confidence in what they say will take a major hit</p>

        <p>"Healthcare worker" here, I am a retail pharmacist - I was the last in my store to wear masks until it became a mandate, whenever someone asked me about the vaccine I told the truth - that I know nothing because we have been told nothing... given no official information as frontline healthcare about the vaccines.</p>
<p>I am the only staff member here still who refuses to get the vaccine. They all know my concerns yet they would rather bury their heads in the sand and hope that things can go to normal so they can travel and go on holidays again...
Meanwhile I have not seen my girlfriend for a year because she is in another country and I am still refusing the vaccine, even if it will eventually allow me to travel.</p>
<p>Last week I officially quit because I no longer wanted to be in this oppressive retail environment...</p>
<p>However it is not that easy for everyone... some have bills, rent, kids to pay for etc... as long as society remains enslaved to money, there will always be a majority of people who are simply loyal to their paycheck, the same reason the police enforce these draconian measures... simply because they need their monthly pay.</p>
<p>But I agree they should not be spreading fasle information and just stay quiet if they aren't going to speak out.</p>

        <p>Not all healthcare workers believe this bs. I'm a caregiver at an assisted living facility. A while back my boss sent out a group text asking who wanted the covid shot. After one maybe and seven no's including me she said to stop texting and send a private email instead. I think she was trying to peer pressure us into taking it but that backfired hard. Sure that's not a big sample size but still zero yes replies is telling.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah for sure. Just saying a lot of the little pee-ons are still good. They are just being crushed down into oblivion by the head honchos. It was a while ago so my numbers are probably off but I think something like 60% of healthcare workers are refusing the covid shot.</p>

        <p>Like scientists, they have expended every bit of goodwill and professional "capital" they had from me.</p>
<p>When you realize a lot of them are products of the diversity/affirmative action culture as well, your opinion will start to shift.   No longer does the cream rise to the top, we have to get different colors and genders in there to make sure the cream is a good cross-sectional representation of the population, not that they're the most qualified to do the job.</p>
<p>Hell, even the decent good ones are just going off of what gets pushed down to them.  They aren't doing research, they're clinicians who don't have time to validate every bit of "science" that gets passed onto them.</p>
<p>And if you think the CDC (with the grabbler director talking about the pandemic of racism roflmao) is going to be a competent watchdog, you're sadly mistaken.</p>

        <p>My mom, who just recovered from Covid a couple months ago, was told by her doctor that immunity may only last 3 months so was told to get the vaccine. She's didn't ask any questions regarding why the doctor thought immunity lasted such a short amount of time and why the vaccine should last any longer, or if she's supposed to get the vaccine every 3 months. </p>
<p>She got the J&amp;J vaccine but so far no issues, at least.</p>

        <p>Don't forget, many coroners and other healthcare professionals were speaking out about calling deaths "covid deaths" last April/May. And then in June, the US passed a Bill providing more money if they write "covid" and suddenly, they stopped speaking out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, folks who are attracted to high-paying jobs are often attracted to high-pay. These are the same folks who the pharmaceutical companies pay to get their patients hooked on pills and something like 83% of over 65 year olds are on 5 or more types per day, regardless of any harm that brings.</p>

        <p>It's not all of them, I know of several people who quit medical careers/jobs because they refused to falsify documents by citing COVID as the C.O.D of Death Certificates in cases it was not, but was being required to be claimed as it was for financial purposes.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve been saying the past year that one of the seriously unfortunate outcomes of all of this is going to be a deepening distrust in the medical community. Particularly those that have had medical procedures delayed- surgeries, cancer treatments, etc. </p>
<p>And itâ€™s really unfortunate because as people here have mentioned, itâ€™s not all healthcare workers. But what do you do when any attempt at speaking out means your instantly cancelled and potentially without a job? Itâ€™s fine to say, do it anyway, do whatâ€™s right but people still need to put food on the table and a lot are also paying down the debt of their schooling to begin with.</p>

        <p>Same. I'm incredibly "pro-science" (whatever that used to mean), but these fuckers have tossed the scientific method out the window.</p>
<p>Science <em>requires</em> debate and dissent. Good scientific ideas and principles need to be tested over and over again, and must be able to be challenged and falsified. What we have now is a hivemind producing manufactured, forced consensus.</p>
<p>This isn't science anymore. I trust science, but I've lost all faith in people who call themselves scientists.</p>

        <p>the underlying problem is the corruption of the people who offer themselves up to being elected as law makers ... they seem fascinated by the chemical and pharmaceutical industry ... also the whole ... fight the illness concept ... fight against bacteria and virus ... fight fight fight using sharp chemicals, toxic cocktails ...</p>
<p>while all the while there has been a natural healing approach what has a soft and embracing attitude towards the microbeings, the bacteria and the virus ... an approach what declares bacteria and virus not to be the enemy but on the contrary appreciates the bacteria and viruses to come and live inside of us, enrich our microfauna, heighten the diversity of the populations of microbeings what live inside our guts and effect all our cellular microcosmos</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>its most sad to watch how this preference for the ... fighting the bacteria ... fighting the virus ... attitude has lead to the majority of people feeling okay to coerce everyone into having to pay taxes for public healthcare what then again moves a high percentage of these coerced contributions towards the producers of pharmaceutical medications</p>
<p>for me its a nightmare to think that the money what I have to pay towards so called insurance against sickness ( krankenkassen are these insurance companies called in switzerland ) every month gets abused to force a vaccine onto a child or a mentally challenged person</p>
<p>the sollution for all this I see in that we the people take responsibility for our level of fitness ... that we stop blaming others for how well or unwell we feel, how fit or unfit our mental/emotional/physical body condition Is at this very moment but use our energy to get better ... to change our diets, move better, choose healthier more loving relationships with whomever we can enjoy an open exchange of sympathy emotions</p>
<p>no doctor, no nurse is responsible for how healthy I am</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>this attack on everyones freedom of movement, freedom of assembly and body autonomy ( when I am not allowed to move my body outside in the fresh air, it can have possibly a negative effect on my health ) ... what is still happening ... has been ongoing since march 2020 on a global scale ... was enabled also by so many people not doing their own inner cleaning up ... but them relying on hospitals, surgical and pharmaceutical quick fixes for what they could have possibly healed themselves when really truly given some saving ones own life effort into it</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but of course this health challenge is being abused ... the caring for each others health ... flattening the curve ... was and is a false flag</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>an intentionally deceiving pretending to trick us into being tested how long we accept how much abuse ... how long we let ourselves being ... stop and go ... wait ... now go ... now slow down again .... now move faster ...etc...</p>
<p>but how could we possibly get away from these people we have elected ourselves into office ?</p>
<p>how could we possibly make these governement office positions disappear but instead allow everyone to decide for itself what to do to heal itself, where to move at what time, with whom to assemble in what size of parties ...</p>
<p>its actually quite simple</p>
<p>by shifting all law making powers to the local community, by allowing the local community, all permanent residents of this village, this town, this city-district to create all the rules and laws what people would be willing to obey and live with ... within the circle of equals ... within the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adults who live here and now In this local community as permanent residents</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>by renewing the very basic contract of our human society, the contract what lies at the foundation of most every regional and nation state</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>by renewing the regional and nation state constitutions, using eventually some concepts like:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</p>

        <p>My wife almost died because we have lost faith in the medical community. She was having some medical issues and she didn't want to go to the hospital, she figured she'd just wait it out at home.</p>
<p>Fortunately we were driving near the hospital when the pain became unbearable for her and we decided to go to the emergency room. She was close to dying in the emergency room, had we been at home there would have been nothing I could have done and I would have lost her.  </p>
<p>Going to the hospital is almost a guaranteed one way ticket to a 2 week quarantine so it was definitely the last place we would want to go.</p>
