    <strong>How much of this masking policy is stemmed from political correctness and wokeism?</strong>
    <p><p>The left keeps pushing political correctness and pronoun 10 gender bullshit now it’s considered murder if you don’t wear a mask. What happen to facts before feelings?</p></p>

        <p>I'd say that vast majority of it stems from some weird ass political concepts. After all, if it was about facts, politicians in the US would probably notice that it simply does not work. They have a perfect example in Italy where I live. Enforcement masking for a year now and virtually no change. Even with severe travel restrictions and half the business in the country shut down, they still call it a crisis, so....</p>

        <p>Yep.  The majority of compliance to these rules is simply in defiance of Donald Trump.  He is gone now.  I expect the rules to relax, but it’s going to take more time, for many more businesses and individuals to feel economic impact negatively, before the pressure to go back to normal wins out.  Unless......</p>
<p>.....this truly is now a dark government ideology that is being carried out.  By that, I mean the consortium of big tech and government is ready to move in a totalitarian method, silencing Americans into submission.  I STILL believe this is tied to the past 4 years rhetoric, in retaliation of the presidency of Donald Trump.  Yes, I believe that what you see today, is a result of democrat voting blocks like large cities and blue states, and large money donors, retaliating because of 2016-2019, losing the power of the White House, after sitting there for 8 years, expecting their New Normal to overtake America forever. They witnessed, in 2016, that much of America still did not want socialized medicine, and many other more controversial ideals that were attacked during the 2008-2016 presidency of Obama.  The amount of mass shootings during that time, the mandate of required health insurance, all were results from that time, or staged in such a way to take away individual CHOICE.</p>
<p>The 2020 events have now rolled over into 2021.  Trump did more to take down the left’s ideas of control, than that period did to further anyone else’s ideals or well-being.  </p>
<p>This post should NOT BE construed as an approval of Donald Trump.  It should be construed as a disapproval of the removal of individual Liberty in America.</p>

        <p>Good points.</p>
<p>Corona quickly became Biden's sole platform on top of the reason he won the primary was, he was the best chance to beat Trump and reverse the divisive executive orders.</p>
<p>Once corona was politicized so heavily because of the election, it's not easy for people who are partisan to let it go.  It has its own momentum so even if Newsom who "believes in Science" wants to end lockdowns, they feel betrayed because.
Also, TBH I think there are also tons of people who were recently inducted to being in the WFH class and the idea of being sent back to work sounds terrible so even if they aren't aware of it consciously, it affects their position on lockdowns.  I know at least two people IRL who will also admit they don't want it to end for their own selfish reasons.  I respect that more than someone who pretends to be virtuous about it though.</p>

        <p>Also cancel culture set us up perfectly for this. Don’t like something the mainstream is pushing? (Stay home-save lives, mask up, don’t have or attend big parties.) You better stay silent otherwise we’ll figure out where you work and complain to your boss and get you fired.</p>

        <p>I’m also convinced that masking in the US is a multi factor tool. 1. Politicians knew mandates would basically divide the US straight down the middle 50/50. 2. In order to gauge vaccine compliance. How enraged (or not) would the public become would give them a good idea on how many people would go get vaccinated. 3. Very few people like wearing a mask so if we tell them we can get back to normal quicker and stop wearing them if you get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Except numerous of us are now pointing out that the 'vaccine' is actually an experimental gene therapy that would not have gotten approved under normal circumstances and you would have to be a fool to get it at this point because of the history of problems with gene therapies in lab animals up until and including 2019.</p>

        <p>People who have gotten the vaccine are being scolded that they still have to wear masks and that the vaccine isn't a free pass to "do what you want." So the vaccine is not going to get us back to normal quicker.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I realize that and it's utterly ridiculous. The people in my community are blind and think as soon as the vaccine gets rolled out to our area, that they're good to go. They're gonna be pissed when they're told otherwise.</p>

        <p>The media in the US is mostly left wing and the media profits more by selling fearful stories so a lot of leftists believe it's a deadly virus because they already trust the media they watch and want to do whatever they can to protect themselves even if the supposed protective measures  that experts are recommending aren't helpful in reality. I'd say the left wing concept that pro-mask/pro-lockdown leftists in the US are using the most to implement mask mandates and lockdowns isn't wokeism or political correctness but rather the concept of equality. The idea that some people can live their lives freely while other people who are at risk should take precautions in their minds is perceived as unfair so we must all equally suffer by reducing everyone's quality of life indefinitely because that is the fair thing to do.</p>
