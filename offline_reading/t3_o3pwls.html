    <strong>Don't Be Afraid to Lead By Example</strong>
    <p><p>Had (what I thought was going to be) a pretty wild moment at the grocery store today. I'm in West LA - doomer ground zero - and I walked into the Ralph's today without my mask. I am not exaggerating when I say I was the only person in a <em>very</em> crowded grocery store that wasn't wearing one.</p>
<p>As I was checking out, I see a man with a mask on approach me. "Hey, man!" he says. Okay, I know where this is going. I wave him off and grab my bags and begin to head out the door.</p>
<p>He predictably follows behind me. "Hey, dude, hey, come here!" I reach for my back pocket and FUCK....I forgot to grab my pepper spray when I left. Okay, well, here we go. I turn around, ready for a confrontation but putting on my call center voice from yesteryear and I say "Hey, what can I do for you?"</p>
<p>He walks right up to me, maybe 2 feet away tops. I brace myself. He pulls down his mask and smiles at me.</p>
<p>"Hey man, it's me, Billy!"</p>
<p>Billy!!!! He is a homeless man that stayed on the corner of where my office is (I still don't have to go in, so I haven't seen him in over a year). He's in the state he's in because he's an alcoholic, but he's an extremely friendly dude that everyone in the area gets along with. He hangs around the grocery store for most of the day, they don't mind, like I said he's always very friendly and never has a confrontation.</p>
<p>First thing he says to me: "I cannot tell you how much it means to me to actually see a friendly face."</p>
<p>He said I was the first person without a mask he'd seen all day (I did catch two myself going in, not sure if they put the mask on once they were inside). He said that as soon as he saw me (and some of this might just be recognizing a familiar person's face) that he felt a huge weight lifted off his shoulders, like this completely inhumane way of living is psychologically damaging or something!</p>
<p>Anyway, we talked for a long while, Billy is super awake, and even <em>he himself</em> said that if this virus was the deadly thing they say it is, it would have ravaged his community already. He doesn't know a single soul who even got sick the past year and a half. He knows it's a scam too.</p>
<p>But no matter what we talked about, he just kept coming back to <em>how good it made him feel</em> to see someone just living their life like a normal human person.</p>
<p>I know it's a bit scary when you're SUPER out-numbered and everyone is acting like brainwashed cowards, but just <em>hold strong.</em> Don't be afraid to set the example!</p>
<p>Oh, and just in case, never forget your pepper spray. :)</p></p>

        <p>Billy is a really good dude who just can't get off the drink. It's a good thing he's a super friendly drunk! Everyone who isn't terrified of homeless people just being homeless actually really likes Billy. I was super happy to see him too.</p>

        <p>I've been doing this all along. I've always been the only one w/o a mask, but never cared what people thought. I just knew I would never wear one but went about my business never understanding the mass compliance. No one hassled me, no one ever asked me to leave. Sometimes I'd be asked if I needed one. "No, thank you."</p>
<p>ETA: In fact, clerks were always very, very friendly toward me and I think it's because they enjoyed seeing a face and communicating freely with me.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’m in the Bay Area and I already had a guy start loudly asking the employees what they thought about unmasked people “not caring about others” when I walked by him. What unmasked people, I was the only unmasked person in the store he obviously meant me lol. I just don’t care anymore as long as they don’t touch me</p>

        <p>I would have had the same initial reaction as you. I’m glad you got to reconnect with Billy! </p>
<p>I went to Target and Nob Hill today. I had gone to Target on Wednesday and was 1 of 2 people not wearing a mask. Today about 70% there were masked up. Every employee had a mask on too. Nob Hill on the other hand, has a larger client base of older people and white people so about 40% weren’t masked up and I saw multiple unmasked employees. And unfortunately they STILL have the 2nd entrance/exit barricades! The doors and windows are covered in red paper and there’s cases of soda blocking the doors. WTF man???? Why????</p>

        <p>You under-appreciate the power of though and the subconscious affect it has on your reality. Especially for the broader social setting, the way you orient your thoughts will project outward into the aether in ways that reciprocate back to you. You reap what you sow is a ancient parable that symbolizes this. It starts with the simple idea of having a weapon in your back pocket.</p>
<p>Intelligence comes in nullifying aggression, not orienting the self towards it.</p>

        <p>Well, as someone who's studied history <em>and</em> sociology, I'm gonna go ahead and go with shit we know to be true over old school mysticism. Sorry!</p>
<p>I know where this is going and I'm not getting caught unprepared. I sincerely hope you wake up and choose to do the same.</p>
<p>I believe we are both perfectly capable of living normal lives and having normal interactions while still maintaining preparedness.</p>

        <p>I know people here in California that have been physically assaulted over the masks, and being a woman...yeah, I’m gonna be careful. These people are batshit crazy and people outside these areas just never seem to grasp the sense of danger from them no matter how many times we try to explain this. They can and will attack people.</p>
<p>Edit: holy shit you sound like the kumbaya guy in beavis and butthead lol. Hope no one ever pulls a knife on you or anything because that “positive energy” is not going to stop them</p>

        <p>I'm only making an observation and reminding OP to always reflect on his actions. Self reflection is a critical part of raising your awareness, and it's easy to fall into bias loops. I only bring it up because this is in fact a conspiracy sub where i assume everyone is well aware of the Ordo Ab Chao philosophy of those who guide the political theater and narrative around covid. Anchor on that and take it with you. I can't give a more relevant takeaway from this thread </p>
<p>Stay vigilant.</p>

        <p>OP is a woman. You have two ears and one mouth, listen (although I suppose you do have ten fingers). Life is different for women. When a man is tagging behind us yelling "hey hey hey", it's not always a good thing and that's also why we carry pepper spray more than men. As you said... It's easy to fall into bias loops and your bias is your perspective of contexts being a man.</p>
