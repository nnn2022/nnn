        <p>My life was destroyed through lockdowns. I’m not going to indulge in pedantic arguments about how mild it all was. Horrific things were unnecessarily forced on society which made life miserable for many except the elite WFH laptop class and made many want to kill them selves just like a prison. No it wasn’t a literally jail cell I at least being in prison could argue I deserved to be there for committing a crime.</p>

        <p>So, you weren't forced into anything. You were just told, "Do 'A', then you get to do 'B'." Your freedom was no different than it was before, you just chose to do 'A'. You can't choose for others, as others can't choose for you. Once you let that happen, then you've lost your freedom. You are always free, just the ones who want to control you will give you choices you don't like. So, rather than accept your choices, make your own.</p>

        <p>It's about Freedom, correct? Well, the Current Normal (or Old Normal), they were still exercising Control, just in a different way. Just because you don't like the New Slave Owner, doesn't mean you should want to go back to the Old Slave Owner. First, do no harm, then you may do what you will. If anyone opposes, then they are the one doing harm.</p>

        <p>I dont mean to come off as harsh though i have to say that that perspective is an incorrect understanding of my personal experience and relationship with law and morality within the USA.</p>
<p>Instead try viewing it this way, if viewing it from my shoes is what you're trying to do, </p>
<p>youre in an unspoken contract</p>
<p>A symbiotic relationship with another enity</p>
<p>To make visualizing this easier I'll say that you and I are the birds that clean the teeth of crocodiles.</p>
<p>It's an unspoken agreement that as long as the croc doesn't try to eat us we'll do it a service and pic its teeth clean. </p>
<p>In turn we get an easy meal and it avoids the many issues that would come in the event that it hadn't had its teeth cleaned.</p>
<p>If the croc decides that it rather eat the birds </p>
<p>The birds have the reflexes and ability to zoom away and find other easy sources of food.</p>
<p>Neither is slave nor master. Two entities with autonomy and freedom to decide how they will go about life. Be it to the mutual benefit of themselves and those around them or the detriment of others for the gain of themselves or in the worst case, to the detriment of themselves.</p>
<p>Such is nature. It's all risk vs reward and whether the reward is worth the risk is up to each individual. All that can be said after the fact is that each individual lives with what they've done like it or not. </p>
<p>Now back to reality.</p>
<p>government and law are very powerful and very compelling entities within whatever society one lives in. </p>
<p>However they need symbiotic relationships with the people they effect. Otherwise humans either rebel, leave, or simply ignore/nullify their influence.</p>
<p>The term "nonewnorm", for me personally, is to say that if I find the current symbiotic arrangement to be unbalanced in such a way that I suffer rather than thrive within the relationship, I reserve the right to find a better more mutually gratifying solution. </p>
<p>Such is to avoid the trope of slaves and masters and promote the practice of true symbiosis with government, law, and society.</p>
<p>Again, for me it's not a question of old and new but rather what is working and what isn't for mutual gain between myself as an individual and the systems I navigate.</p>

        <p>What I 'm trying to relate to you is that you are being played with a "good cop, bad cop" routine. The New Normal is the "bad cop", and you don't like "bad cop", so you'll cooperate with "good cop" (the Old Normal). Either way, they want to get something out of you, because they're on the same team.</p>

        <p>I understand that's what you're saying </p>
<p>To put what my response to that into metaphor: you're looking at it as though we're playing checkers while we're actually playing chess. </p>
<p>Youre stuck in primitive rules of master and slave, "us versus them", oppressor versus oppressed</p>
<p>while I'm seated at the negotiation table. </p>
<p>You think youre trapped in a room with no doors, no bars, nor are you shackled, chained, or leashed.</p>
<p>You've the mindset of a cornered critter while you sit alone in an empty space.</p>
<p>There are indeed ill wishers and wrong doers</p>
<p>Preemptively flinching before you're stricken will not save you. </p>
<p>Careful calculation along with a thoughtful and a collected response helps you to meet an obstacle as it presents itself thus affording you adaptability. </p>
<p>Should the obstacle adjust to meet you as well </p>
<p>You won't be caught unaware. </p>
<p>I've never set it in my mind that this was about new or old normal. I stated that many times now.</p>
<p>There is no good cop nor is there a bad cop.</p>
<p>The only factors I've ever presented and negotiated with are my personal needs, expectations, and terms. </p>
<p>This has been the case sense the moment I set out into the world on my own. It's how I was raised to approach all facets of life. </p>
<p>The terms I set will be just that. You assume I'm given my terms by someone else when this is simply untrue.</p>
<p>I've yet to compromise and as such I've taken on responsibility for those decisions. However I've not lacked for it. I've resources to compensate, connections to pull from, and other avenues to give me the things that negotiations with government, law, and general society haven't been able to secure me.</p>
<p>Such is life and nature. We take on risks we deem worth the perral. We take on risks and responsibilities we think we can handle. </p>
<p>Why should I be at the mercy of anyone? In your opinion. </p>
<p>Why should I, who has access to medicine, security, food, water, and other frivolous goods and means of production limit myself to the options proposed by some other who's influence is only felt when actively acknowledged?</p>
<p>I've broken no laws, I've harmed no one, I have a plethora avenues to secure my needs and desires.</p>
<p>It is only when im approached and demanded to change my views on my own existence as an African American within this country to suit the goals of someone else that I take pause.</p>
<p>To that I say no. I have nothing to gain from it. In fact I'd do so at a deep and personal detriment. It would sully relationships and taint the mutual benefits of myself and my community.  The very community that allows me to thrive so efficiently. </p>
<p>Why should I agree to stricter gun laws and procedures where I live when here there's no warrant or outcry for such measures? </p>
<p>Time is a valuable and non-renewable commodity. You want me to waste it even further on the insecurities of a territory thousands of miles away from here? </p>
<p>I choose not to. Too much of a loss without gain. 
It would be to my detriment. If someone somewhere else would like to do that then so be it but leave me out of it. </p>
<p>These are the sorts of decisions I have to address. I have to assess whether or not something is worth my compliance, tolerance, or acceptance.</p>
<p>And if not then I go on about my personal business.</p>
<p>You act a though people didn't smoke weed when it was illegal. It still is in some state and yet they still enjoy it.</p>
<p>the risk and reward are based on the individual. Whether they award their compliance, tolerance, or acceptance is up to them whether they realize it or not.</p>
<p>I realize this. </p>
<p>And that's why your response to my statement is a bit off.</p>

        <p>I've long been arguing that overpopulation, ecological decline and the way that society is run in general needs a massive overhaul. The "Old Normal" was shit really if we're talking post 2001. Come to think of it, it wasn't great pre-2001 either really but at least we still had freedom of speech and we didn't have judgemental arseholes all over social media.  </p>
<p>The problem isn't in identifying issues. The problem is that the solutions that the world's richest are offering will make the vast majority of people serfs, effectively. The "New Normal" espoused by the media is basically digital slavery. If you think that's a worthy solution to the world's ills then you need your head examining.</p>

        <p>It wasn't so great, but our "betters" allowed us serfs some semblance of liberty, at least.</p>
<p>Now, they've just done away with the pretense of the "free" world completely.</p>
