    <strong>Left leaning or anti-gunners who are on this sub, do you still support gun control?</strong>
    <p><p>Ever since I got into politics years ago I‚Äôve discussed gun control with peers, right wingers and left wingers all over the internet, in my family, and really anywhere else I‚Äôve had a political discussion with irl. In the end we‚Äôd find common ground somewhere and we‚Äôd both look at history and governments stripping people of the right to defend yourself, however most of the time the anti-gunner would say something along the lines of ‚Äúthat wouldn‚Äôt happen here‚Äù (usually referencing either US, Canada, or Western Europe) well now look at Canada. </p>
<p>Back when Trudeau put the gun laws into effect after the mass shooting I started to get into discussions with Canadians; I couldn‚Äôt understand why he was banning certain guns that wouldn‚Äôt have even stopped or mitigated the mass shooting in the first place, but it makes sense... it‚Äôs the boiling the frog method, slowly over time (2 years I believe) you must not have possession of ‚Äúx‚Äù guns or you will be punished. </p>
<p>Canadians, do you not see what‚Äôs coming? The government doesn‚Äôt fear you, they view you as subjects and w/o a defense against an authoritarian government you <em>are</em> subjects. I don‚Äôt care if you are anti gun, I understand why people are anti gun as they don‚Äôt like seeing shootings but now you need to understand why there are pro gun people; we don‚Äôt like to see big powerful governments pushing around defenseless citizens. </p>
<p>Stand up for yourselves. I‚Äôm not Canadian myself but if this were to happen in the States (currently our government still fears us thankfully) I‚Äôll die before I give up my 2nd amendment. Make it known you don‚Äôt trust your government and you don‚Äôt wish to give them this much power.</p></p>

        <p>So I'm a left leaning Englishman. Not modern left I hasten to add.</p>
<p>More Tony Benn kinda left.

<p>Now I've ways been against gun ownership, traditionally aghast at gun deaths etc... Stateside. We had a famous school shooting at dunblane that was very informative in my growing years in informing that position. It resulted in a handgun ban in the UK.</p>
<p>Now, as I've learnt to see more clearly, and of course witnessed with growing discomfort the direction the world is heading towards with the <em>pandemic</em> being used as a vehicle towards a totalitarian, authoritarian medicalised state, with many disturbing similarities to pre war2 Germany.

<p>I find myself getting these last year's, increasingly so the need and wisdom for the right to bear arms. To be able to protect against enemies foreign and domestic. Obviously the largest threat these days being our own governments and the vested interests that effectively own them.</p>
<p>So my position has changed over the years, the states and the constitution had it right all along. </p>
<p>And to add to that, is easy to observe the strange number of mass shootings increasing in time with this adminstration and the related calls once again to remove such an essential right. (A conspiracy one could say).</p>

        <p>We've just eased out of our third lockdown. So looking up in the short term.</p>
<p>However the horrendously high compliance amoung the general population with mrna vaccines, lockdowns, facemasks etc... The governments narrative already shifting towards lockdowns being the golden bullet as opposed to vaccines, and the likelihood of the unvaccinated and young being blamed for the surge in deaths after summer... Is not giving me much hope all in all, outside of an act of God that is. </p>
<p>Generally, we as a people have an incredibly passive/subservient mindset in relation to established authority... comes from generations of peasantry/landowners/royalty/class etc... Dating right back to the Romans I reckon üòï</p>
<p>But it's lovely and sunny right now, trying to do the right thing, day by day and not look too far ahead (and thus get disheartened)</p>

        <p>I'm in the UK too (Scotland specifically) and I agree with the compliance issues you've seen. People here just seem to do what they're told. It's unnerving to see people just go along with what ever seemingly arbitrary rules are put in place. </p>
<p>I should also say the lockdown is very different in Scotland and, unlike England, doesn't actually have an end date in place for leaving lockdown/rules etc.</p>

        <p>I used to be a bit left on guns, then more moderate, but what actually opened my eyes to the importance of gun rights was the riots. Seeing business owners standing outside of their shops with shotguns and AR-15s drove the point home for me. We need guns for when governments become too oppressive <em>and</em> for when they become too weak</p>

        <p>You pretend "it can't happen in America" but it can &amp; has. Gun bans? Sure! Read about Chicago &amp; DC. They got some privileges restored (not rights, you don't have to buy permission for rights) by the Supreme Court, not a gunfight. </p>
<p>Remember hurricane Katrina?</p>
<p>Remember Clinton's 'assault weapon' ban? Ended through sunsetting, not a gunfight. </p>
<p>Maybe you mean Covid lockdowns? But then you'd have to admit many States did, some still are &amp; none ended by gunfight. </p>

        <p>Tl;Dr: I fully support gun control, but gun control doesn't mean a blanket ban of guns. </p>
<p>Let me preface my answer by quickly explaining the situation if my country. </p>
<p>I live in Switzerland, a tiny country in Europe. In a way our situation is similar to the US, in that that we have a shit ton of guns. Compared to our neighbours that is. Our gun culture is also heavily ingrained into our countrys culture, so that we have annual shooting festivals and if you want, you can meet up with your mates at a shooting range on a weekly basis to train. There are even such weekly courses where you learn to shoot as a child. Learned how handle and maintain a rifle when I was 10 myself.</p>
<p>In short, we like our guns a lot ha!</p>
<p>However, here is where Switzerland and the US begin to diverge. Switzerland has very strict and onerous gun control laws, such as (depending on the weapon you want the permit for) background checks, psychological assessments, firearm safety course and so on. For many weapons you mustn't store their ammunition at your home(you store it at your local shooting range), guns have to be kept in a safe, they have to be trackable (by number) and so on. 
Additionally, your right to a gun may be taken away if you commit certain criminal offences. </p>
<p>Where does this lead us? Well, I've sufficient access to guns, I can be sure that most everyone who owns a gun around me isn't an unstable moron and we've had a single mass shooting (in the american sense) in the past 50 years I believe. </p>
<p>There are many things that I left out, such as the military service which means that a respectable portion of our population is trained to handle a rifle. Or that certain fully automatic weapons are banned because there is no common sense reason to own one here. But this is the gist of things here. </p>
<p>Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of our system here, I don't see our gun control laws as a nuisance, but rather a feature. Sure they are strict, but they also ensure the safety of me and others, while enabling me to pass the respect towards guns on to my eventual children in a save manner.</p>
