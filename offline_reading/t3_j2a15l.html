    <strong>Can someone explain how the UK mask exemption works</strong>
    <p><p>So from what i understand people are so supposed to take you at your word, they cant ask for specific medical information and such. I go back to college tomorrow but i have no idea how to explain it someone. I emailed the college and all they said was they  are following the advice and guidance of Public Health England regarding face coverings. Do i just show up and say 'sorry but i cannot wear a face mask , i have a disability that prevents me from wearing one'. I've seen videos on here of cops not accepting that excuse and arresting them</p>
<p>To any brigade folk today i have a genuine disability that makes speaking difficult due  to people can’t see im struggling to speak, and the mask reduces airflow so speech is less loud and causes anxiety and panic attacks</p></p>

        <p>I think you can just download something that says you're exempt. You could always call your GP and ask them. 
Even the receptionists at the surgery should know so you shouldn't need to speak directly to a doctor.</p>
<p>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own</p>
<p>If you scroll down that page a wee bit, there are images you can download to your phone that you can show others to show that you're exempt. Or you can print one off if you prefer a physical copy.</p>

        <p>I do have a question regarding that. If you can't wear a mask due to greatly decreased lung capacity or whatever. Shouldn't you be one of the few people who should actually be concerned about all this? Like even if you conceded that it isn't a big deal (which I don't but arguments sake) wouldn't you be the exact person that it might affect? Or are you advocating that people just lie to fit their agenda?</p>

        <p>Your right to force me to wear a mask to prevent you from *potentially* catching a virus from me with a 99.9+% survival rate for most people ENDS where my right to my body and freedom of expression begins. That simple. Same goes for quarantining healthy people. Businesses can always turn people away if they want (i.e. no shirt, no shoes, no service). Nothing had to be changed to enable them to do that.   </p>
<p>But government mask mandates are where we must draw the line if we want to truly be a free society. If we're happy tumbling down to the ant heap of totalitarianism, then sure mandate masks, but understand you're giving up much, much more than your right to show your face.</p>

<p>Comparing drunk driving to not wearing a mask or not staying locked up in your house is laughable. Humans have been living unmasked and more or less free to associate for 200,000 years. It's asking a lot more of people to entirely deny their nature indefinitely &amp; without recourse.</p>
<p>Gambling, drugs, and prostitution should all be legal as well. There should be protections to prevent people from being tricked or exploited (as with anything -- making false claims on products/services is illegal &amp; always has been), but otherwise, consenting, informed adults can do what they'd like as far as I'm concerned.</p>

        <p>The thing is,  i'm not a sociopath.  I dont want to infect older people in my family or area.  Especially when wearing a mask is like such a meniscule thing. </p>
<p>Also,  you can have long lasting problems due to corona without immediately dying.<br>
You know what also is denying human nature? Not Murdering people from other groups.  Seems like something i still want to be a thing.  </p>

        <p>I'm also not a sociopath (though it is a weird thing to say).</p>
<p>I don't want to infect older people either. We should provide information to them about the best ways to mitigate their own risk, like remaining home during outbreak spikes. There are many solutions we could employ, as Sweden did (although they, as NY state, had some early failings with Nursing homes), that rely on few to little mandates or draconian shutdowns.</p>
<p>There are double the amount of people starving this year due to supply chain disruptions caused by these authoritarian lockdowns. If you force people not to work, many starve. Over 50 million people are facing food scarcity in the US alone, worldwide it is hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>9 million people die from starvation a year on average. If, in one year, we have doubled the amount of people who are "starving", it stands to reason that we might see a doubling of deaths (potentially 18 million, though organizations like the World Food Programme are estimating 30 million DEATHS, not cases of starvation, DEATHS). No one, even in the height of covid hysteria, ever predicted 9 million (let alone 18-30 million) people would die from the virus. There continues to be no one making that claim, as it is ridiculous.</p>
<p>The shutdowns and mandates may seem compassionate at face value, but they are causing infinitely more harm &amp; death than they are saving lives. I'll provide some reading for you to better support these arguments below:</p>
<p>Edit: (Just to be clear, 1 million people have died so far from CV. We're talking about 18-30 million deaths from starvation this year, a 100-230% increase compared to last year. Numbers do not lie. Trust the science, the lockdowns were wrong).</p>

        <p>Now we change the goalpost,  the economic impact and policies surely are questionable and what i expect to be discussed. </p>
<p>I just don't see the point in being such whussies about wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Sweden however has currently 5 times the amount of corona death cases than for example germany (per 1m people). So i am not sure if swedens approach was appropriate,  but that'll have to be determined after the second wave,  which should happen before christmas in germany.  </p>
<p>And be very careful with "numbers dont lie", sure they don't lie,  but it is very easy to lie with them. For example your bloomberg article shows the failure of the social system of the US more so than the failure of some lockdown decisions and i really honestly hope american citizen will notice that and demand change to it,  instead of calling it evil socialism.  </p>
<p>I definetely have not accounted for the poverty in developing nations (outside of india),  which i should have.</p>

        <p>It's not about "being a whussie" about wearing a mask. I wear them all the time. I just don't think the government should be in the business of forcing people to, or forcing them to stay in their home. It's an infringement on our civil liberties if the government is the one enforcing it, and a slippery slope towards authoritarianism or totalitarianism. "Give them an inch they'll take a mile". Owners of private property and businesses are free to discriminate against people for not using masks or social distancing if they so choose, and can request the government's help (i.e. the police) to remove people who are not complying, as they have always been able to do.</p>
<p>These issues are not limited to the united states, they are happening in all nations that have instituted lockdowns worldwide. The article I shared from bloomberg was more to illustrate that the starvation is not just a third-world problem but also a Western one (although, most people facing food scarcity in the US will not starve, the chances of that are very low). Regardless, the impact food scarcity &amp; economic regression can have on long term health, especially for children, is undeniable, just as the coronavirus after effects are.</p>
<p>The larger point is that our carrying capacity as a species is heavily dependent, at least currently, on the economy being open and international trade being as fluid as possible. When we cut ourselves off from each other, we were damning millions to die from starvation. Many knew it and ignored it. One of the articles I posted was from Apirl &amp; made it crystal clear. Unicef, Oxfam, the WHO all released reports related to this, but they fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>If sweden's approach wasn't appropriate, the other EU nations wouldn't be copying them. Most all of them are trying to avoid shutdowns due to the reasons I've illustrated above. Top down solutions are indiscriminate and heavy handed, most people would have complied if they were asked to instead of forced (as they are doing now)</p>
