    <strong>Ok but can someone tell me why are vaccines dangerous and why won't you wear a mask xD?</strong>
    <p><p>Don't use arguments like "iTs StEaLinG OuR frEeDom AnD" How much freedom is taken away from you by wearing a mask lmao? How sensitive are you?
Don't use arguments in the comments that distract from my question, answer directly.</p></p>

        <p>Sure thing! </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">large study</a> of the “safety and efficacy” of the vaccine has a huge hole in it—they merely vaccinated participants and then hoped and prayed they would come into contact with the wild virus by chance. But there is no guarantee of exposure—far from it—so there is no actual test of safety OR efficacy, when you consider that most lab animals in previous coronavirus vaccine trials (which were systematically exposed to the virus they were vaccinated against) died of ADE, especially if they seemed to develop perfect antibodies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://id.elsevier.com/ACW/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com%2Faction%2FconsumeSsoCookie%3FredirectUri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.thelancet.com%252Faction%252FconsumeSharedSessionAction%253FI2KBRCK%253D1%2526JSESSIONID%253DaaaxMgxF_jwLS9MicyuOx%2526MAID%253DnwtDnnX6yA6uoIcAtieLwQ%25253D%25253D%2526SERVER%253DWZ6myaEXBLF%25252B9vQ18y9JMw%25253D%25253D%2526ORIGIN%253D844971718%2526RD%253DRD%2526exp%253D75icYvzOgUVEevYEfIgkYg%2525253D%2525253D%26code%3Dnull"><em>largest</em> study</a> of the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines also has a glaring problem with it—it does not account for the incongruent testing of vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. The hospitalization rate of the unvaccinated is higher simply because the COVID test for a vaccinated versus an unvaccinated person is different. The one for the unvaccinated uses an <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/Ct_Fact_Sheet.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value between 35 and 40</a>, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">even Fauci admits produces a useless result, that is, a 40-90% false positive rate</a>. The one the vaccinated are given, on the other hand, uses a much more reasonable <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value less than or equal to 28</a>. What this means is that many unvaccinated people are actually being misdiagnosed when they go to the hospital, whereas far fewer vaccinated people are.</p>
<p>Here is a list of studies showing masks don’t work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>

<p>This is clearly the sign of a weak minded individual who has a weak argument.  I suggest you don't let yourself be controlled so easily by your emotions, take a deep breath, and go for a walk.</p>

        <p>The vaccine, as we all know, is approved for emergency use. It does not have full approval.</p>
<p>The previous attempts at a coronavirus vaccine are the current one’s “family history”—meaning they show what happened when scientists tried to create vaccines for past coronaviruses. This reveals the unique problems the scientists faced when developing coronavirus vaccines in particular, which they would need to solve in order to formulate a safe vaccine for public distribution.</p>
<p>However, as seen in my previous comment, there is absolutely zero evidence they addressed a single one of the past problems, casting severe doubt on the vaccine’s safety.</p>

        <p>Sorry to be pedantic, but many people are confusing the word "approved" with the word "authorization" and they shouldn't be.  Per the FDA's website:  </p>
<p>"In certain types of emergencies, the FDA can issue an emergency use authorization, or EUA, to provide more timely access to critical medical products (including medicines and tests) that may help during the emergency when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternative options.</p>
<p>The EUA process is different than FDA approval, clearance, or licensing because the EUA standard may permit authorization based on significantly less data than would be required for approval, clearance, or licensing by the FDA"</p>
<p>So, and again sorry to be pedantic,  the FDA has <strong>not</strong> approved the vaccine for emergency use.  They <strong>issued</strong> an Emergency Use Authorization.  I believe it's an important enough of a distinction that we should strive to keep the language clear.</p>

        <p>I don't think you can ask people to answer a question, but then tell them that they're not allowed to answer by using the answer!</p>
<p>Fundamentally, your freedom is being reduced by the imposition of wearing a mask, and most people that oppose them do so due to a combination of this and, rightly, believing that they do nothing meaningful to protect anyone's health.</p>
<p>In addition, I personally don't wear them because they're not comfortable and I don't want to wear them. </p>
<p>I work from home, I did before Covid, I haven't been on public transport or in a workplace, I haven't mixed with many people at all, so the chances of me contracting any virus are slim to zero. I'm damned if I'm going to wear a mask, which doesn't protect me anyway, against a virus that I haven't contracted, that won't do me any harm if I do somehow contract it.</p>
<p>If people want to voluntarily impede their own breathing, act like sheep, and look like idiots, be my guest. I don't want to do any of those things.</p>

        <p>These "vaccines" are still in a trial phase that will not end for another two years, there is absolutely no knowing what long term effects these will have on people, its like a tobacco manufacturer saying smoking doesn't cause cancer because you had a cigarette yesterday and haven't got it yet.. there is a reason they take 5 - 10 years to develop not 6 months</p>
<p>But the short term data has shown tens of thousands dying and millions of adverse reactions from paralysis to blindness</p>
<p>every previous mRNA trial was ended because of the impacts on the animal subjects</p>
<p>you do realise you are genetically modyfing your own cells to produce a pathogen, thats something that cant be undone and there are over 30 trillion cells in the human body. actually the "science" doesnt even know how many there are so how can they know what will and will not be impacted</p>
