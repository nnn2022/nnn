    <strong>Chatty older people</strong>
    <p><p>Weird observation: has anyone else noticed older  people chatting you the hell up in public? Post office, grocery store, hardware store. Striking up conversation and just being the chattiest Cathys you can imagine...</p>
<p>I think they are really lonely. I’m deeply concerned about older people who are living independently (alone) but missing church, volunteering, social time with their friends and visits from their family. My heart is aching for them.</p>
<p>I try to make the most robust conversation I can. I weirdly want to ask them if they want a friend or visitor, but that feels strange.</p></p>

        <p>As a single older person I can confirm that I've really suffered this year and after being anti social for most of my life, nowadays I'm happy to chat with just about anybody. 
Older people are just young people who've survived a lot of bs.</p>

        <p>I think single people of all ages are suffering and it’s unforgivable what has been done to them. Being single is not a crime. So why are we condemning those who live alone to solitary confinement? My governor is one of the ones saying Thanksgiving should not “mix households.” And apparently there are fines attached to this now.</p>
<p>I was single for my entire 20s and estranged from family. God bless the friends who treated me like family every holiday. God bless friendship in general - friends are the family you choose. How dare the government interfere with something as intimate and vital as our social lives. Or expect single people to eat a TV dinner at home alone with the lights off on thanksgiving.</p>

        <p>You're right and I've noticed that I've been reaching out to a lot of younger people online who sounded really desperate. Helping to support someone else helps me too because it reminds me of my own strength.</p>
<p>I've spent long periods of my life being single because I find it hard to be in intimate relationships for too long. The last girlfriend I had was about 10 years ago but (miraculously) I've just met someone new who I totally clicked with so I'm really happy about that. This thing we're living through suddenly seems a lot less overwhelming when you start feeling some love in your life.</p>

        <p>Yes! The are totally lonely cause their family won’t visit them anymore. It turns out human beings have a deep need for social interaction. They didn’t account for this in the Neil Ferguson model, treating humans simply as disease vectors.</p>
