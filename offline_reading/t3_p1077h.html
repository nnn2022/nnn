    <p><p>It’s possible to live a normal life without vaccines.  Cue the Reddit hate telling me that they hope my kids die from measles.  (Happens anytime I mention not being vaccinated)</p></p>

        <p>Hell yes you can live a normal life. You'll live a better life actually. They want you to feel bad but don't. With all the data available, if they still think vaccines are safe, then they are ignorant.</p>

        <p>My wife and I got all of ours as children, but having looked into vaccines ourselves, we really want to avoid them for our children. Our biggest concern is tetanus because if the child contracts it, the symptoms don't show until the damage is already done. How did you navigate diseases that don't show early symptoms that you can treat?</p>

        <p>The only time I've ever heard of someone getting the tetanus vaccine is after they've stepped on a nail or cut themselves with rusty tin. You can usually tell pretty fast if a kid has cut themselves deep enough to need it. I stepped on a tack in a treehouse as a kid and screamed bloody murder for like an hour but it didn't draw blood and never had to get the shot.</p>

        <p>Anybody who wishes children to die has other underlying issues other than their own biased opinion. Those kinds of people are so broken that they probably showed signs of instability before covid measures. Ever since the pandemic, they went full tilt. </p>
<p>I know it’s hard to take things personally sometimes, but those people are just seriously mentally devolved. If you look at their eyes, you can see they have lost something in their head. Seriously</p>

        <p>Personally I'm not an antivaxxer and if I ever have kids I would probably give them the required vaxs for school, but I'll be damned if they get a Hep B at 2 days old, or go in at two months and get five injections at once. They have six years before they need the required vaccines and there is no reason for them to get multiples in one day before they are even a year old, and no child needs Hep B at all. My parents had me get all the required shots but they definitely didn't follow the recommended schedule for them, and I never had measles or mumps or any other childhood disease despite not getting the allegedly ideal dosage schedule.</p>

        <p>I work with new borns and mothers and the differences I see with the parents who go the rout of 6/10 vaccines at a time vs people who spread it out is quite obvious. Breastfeeding success, sleep, and overall stress are the acute symptoms. But clearly the baby is very stressed out and uncomfortable for 6/10 days after they get their shots. Really sad. Because I want to help but you really can’t tell someone they did the wrong thing for their child.</p>

        <p>lol l've had vaccines but not the one for measles. Haven't managed to contract it even though l was around people who had it when l was a kid.Though l've had mumps and chicken pox but still here and no long term effects. </p>
<p>l'm not against vaccines if they have a high efficacy and they're supposed to prevent a serious disease but there's an obsession with them already. Like vaccines for chicken pox,the flu, HPV and the rona</p>

        <p>I’m very curious if your children are creative? A friend of mine didn’t want to vaccinate his child and his ex-partner did it behind his back and he said that she lost a lot of creative abilities. Couldn’t draw how she could before and her imagination was different. 
I’m very fascinated by this. Anyone have any stories like this?

        <p>The world needs more of this kind of testimony. My son has never had a vaccine and he is incredibly healthy. Literally every other kid he knows gets sick, he doesn’t. More than half of his class has a learning disorder, he’s a straight A student. Almost all of his friends have allergies, he doesn’t. He is also bigger, stronger, faster, than 99% of them and it isn’t because he got some crazy good genetics.</p>

        <p>Kinda assuming you're a troll....but....</p>
<p>No, we don't want anyone to catch or die from any of these diseases.  That said, the only reason you and your kids are relatively safe from them is from a combination of herd immunity and blind luck.</p>
<p>Not all the diseases for which you can be inoculated are human transmissible.  Look up lockjaw and please go get at least your tetanus shot!</p>
<p>Vaccines are an incredible invention and have been saving millions or billions of lives for hundreds of years.  Dismissing them all is simple ignorance.</p>
<p>Accepting them all is, of course, just as ignorant.</p>

        <p>Why would you assume I’m a troll?   I’ve mentioned that I’m not vaccinated on previous accounts and someone always tells me they hope my family dies.  </p>
<p>In my state I have to write the Secretary of State to get a religious exemption form so my kids can go to school.  I’m not an antivaxxer like most.  I had an older sibling react badly to a vaccine so I’ve seen what they can do to people.   Not everyone obviously, but I’ll take my chances with the disease than the risk of the vaccine.</p>

        <p>A friend from high school messaged me after she saw a Facebook post I made about not being vaccinated.  She said her two month old baby cried for 48 hours straight after getting her shots.  The mom knew immediately that her formerly perfectly healthy baby girl was injured by the shots.  A few months later and her daughter was diagnosed with autism.  She also said that after the vaccine her daughter stopped smiling.  They eventually found out that she had something like 1000 times the normal levels of aluminum in her system so they started chelation therapy.  She began to slowly recover after that but I’m not sure how it ended because I deleted my faceberg.</p>
<p>Edit:  I found out how it ended.  I had one of my buddies message her on fb to get an update.  Mind you I haven’t talked to her in probably 5 years.  https://files.catbox.moe/dnhei3.jpeg</p>

        <p>Glad to hear they stopped giving them. It really is tragic that metal adjuvants like aluminum and mercury in tons of “traditional” vaccines can cause autism, and auto immune diseases, etc. people really don’t even know what an adjuvant is but there’s no reason we need heavy metals crossing our blood brain barrier, ESPECIALLY as healthy pure babies. It’s so fucked up, survival of the fittest, glad their baby is doing better!</p>

        <p>This is the same logic that has caused the insane fear of covid.  Emotional, personal stories weigh disproportionately on our minds, but they don't convey the actual risk we should be considering.   Yes, vaccines can harm people, but so can the diseases you're not protected against.  I have family experience with polio, and it's life-altering.</p>
<p>Until you weight the actual chances of negative vaccine impacts against the risk of catching a disease and having a severe case, you're not making a sound decision.</p>
<p>This should realistically be done by vaccine.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, any hepatitis shots are worth getting.  Tetanus, polio certainly.  Flu is low risk low reward.  HPV is an interesting discussion.  Measles, mumps, croup, chickenpox are rare and not terribly dangerous, they just suck.  Historically smallpox vaccines were VERY dangerous, but still less dangerous than the disease, so it was worth the tradeoff in most cases.</p>
<p>I do assume that anyone who comes in with a lengthy "all vaccines bad!" post is just a troll trying to discredit the community.  By and large most of us support well tested vaccines, because actual analysis has shown that on balance they do FAR more good than harm. by many orders of magnitude.</p>

        <p>This isn't an anti-vaccine subreddit.  It's a subreddit against the new normal and all its trappings.  One aspect of that is a dangerous experimental drug being forced on people, similar to what was done 10 years ago with a different not-very-scary disease and rushed vaccine.</p>
<p>Being against one vaccine doesn't imply we are against all vaccine any more than being for or against one medication applies to the rest, or one red governor to the rest, or masks for one purpose (i still wear a p100 when spraying my yard and an scba when running inside burning buildings!) to the rest, etc.</p>

        <p>I was thinking about the label "unvaccinated."  For me and I think most of nnn that term is a misnomer. 
I don't like that position being conflated.  I hate lockjaw.  I use vaccines.  (Actual vaccines.  SOME of them.)</p>
<p>I believe in personal autonomy.  I'd fight for the right of refusal.  Particularly because if any person can compel physical compliance = ownership. </p>

        <p>This is a correct answer, but I am sure you will be downvoted for it.</p>
<p>The reason a large number of people can go without vax and never catch these diseases is because an even larger number of people got them.  It's called herd immunity.  You are not going to get it if no one around you has it. </p>
<p>As someone who grew up before most of the childhood inoculations, I highly suggest taking these.  I never got an MMR vaccine.  I DID get Mumps, Measles, and Rubella.  (and chicken pox, strep throat, mononucleosis, and later shingles) It's not fun.</p>
