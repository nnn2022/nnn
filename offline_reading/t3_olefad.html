        <p>Now couple that with the social/political unrests and demonization of race and political beliefs by political actors. And the silencing/censorship from voicing opinions and concerns by said political actors.</p>
<p>Mass shootings, terrorism, and general violence are a result of mental instability, depression, and oppression. As it stands, all the right things are aligned for it.</p>

        <p>I think this guy is just pushing a book and trying to take advantage of people to sell it. His studies are very questionable. </p>
<p>He did not even look at coronavirus lockdown studies at all. He never looked at timelines of infection vs timelines of lockdowns. He did not look at places where lockdown was used vs places where it was not.</p>
<p>He references Sweden as a comparison but does not mention that  Sweden  has several times the number of confirmed cases and deaths than <br>
all neighboring Scandinavian countries with similar demographics <br>
combined.  Because they all had lockdowns. </p>
<p>Also, his claim that Sweden did not have lockdowns is only partially true. From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>""In December 2020 both King Carl XVI Gustaf and Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven admitted they felt that Sweden's COVID-19 strategy had been a failure due to the large number of deaths.[10]<br>
Following agency advice, the government has passed legislation limiting freedom of assembly<br>
 by temporarily banning gatherings of over 50 individuals, banning <br>
people from visiting nursing homes, and physically closing secondary <br>
schools and universities.</p>
