        <p>During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, social distancing measures were introduced, such as closing schools, theaters, and places of worship, limiting public transportation, and banning mass gatherings. In some places, such as Japan, wearing face masks became common.</p>

        <p>And the current quarantine and shutdown have saved millions of lives. Estimates show that between 900,000 and 2.7 million lives have been saved in the U.S. alone, and that estimate was from July. The shutdown of the public places was the quarantine. Cities with stronger quarantine policies in place had lower death rates compared to more relaxed cities. Philadelphia had relaxed laws, and there were 748 deaths per 100,000. St. Louis had stronger rules, and they had 358 deaths per 100,000.</p>

        <p>They can only reference the 1918 flu because no one is alive to say that it wasn’t true. They can say whatever the fuck they want in the history books, literally rewrite news articles about it if they wanted. Sure show me some old timey fuckin picture of people in black and white wearing the same style masks as we are today 😂 what a joke, I have a medical book from 1910 and they literally thought that drinking some alcohol, dumping alcohol on wounds, and stitching up a gash with some animal hairs was the best medical advice. (Along with so much worse, like giving your child a mixture of alcohol when they’ve got a cold or something small, maybe take a bath in some salt and lye) So tell me how they had the same measures implemented? And if they did, how can it be the best thing to do if A)it obviously didn’t help in the 1918 flu and B)we really haven’t advanced in 102 years? Hilarious.</p>

        <p>I’m just saying it’s sad that we haven’t somehow advanced past 102 year old medicine. (That didn’t prove to work) When it comes to masks, because we’ve changed literally almost every other aspect of medicine, also what we deem as healthy. That’s just my observation.</p>

        <p>Fair enough. Mask technology has barely improved over recent years, but recent research has proven that they help slow transmissions of the disease. Its really the best we can do until a safe vaccine is made.</p>

        <p>Vaccines have the highest chance of working compared to anything else we have now. The numbers depend on the disease, some have been completely eradicated by vaccines and some vaccines only work 50% of the time. Its just our best shot. Also, this vaccine will be rushed out, so there will be less testing. If you get it, I would recommend not doing it right away in case there are side effects.</p>

        <p>Safety precautions are fake and gay. This is a fake and gay dystopia. It all started with people being fake and gay because they wanted to be safe and protected from being raped by Chimps thousands of years ago. Humanity is fake and gay and it always was. Nothing wrong with living in an unsafe way buddy...they should teach this in school but then they wouldnt be able to make you buy safety. We all end up dead no matter how much you think your safety measure makes a difference life will always find a way to fuck you in another way you didnt see coming.</p>

        <p>No i dont think there is anything wrong with being gay. But i find "fake and gay" funny as a figure of speech because it is so ridiculous on so many levels.</p>

        <p>I would love to hear the “decades” of “safety precautions” you’re referencing.  Because that would be...washing your hands, staying home when your sick, and cleaning surfaces.  There has been plenty of research on masks (so many people think this is the <strong><em>first time</em></strong> we’ve ever considered masking society due to deadly diseases), and (<em>shocking</em>) any research done before 2020 that I could find was either inconclusive or the conclusion that we should <strong>not</strong> wear masks because of the additional harm they can have (i.e. if you touch the mask and you have a virus or bacteria on your hands, it is now attached to that mask...and presumably you). </p>
<p>I have yet to see someone on this subreddit question washing your hands, staying home when sick, and cleaning surfaces...</p>
