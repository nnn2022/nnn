        <p>Well the flu has all but disappeared and covid has arrived in roughly the same numbers, we never did mass testing for flu so we will never be certain. I heard a great quote that “covid is flu with a better PR team”, which seems about right.</p>
<p>You look at the faked whooping cough “pandemic” of 2003 (so they have form for such things) and things like event 201 combined with such things as who funds John Hopkins and the BBC and WHO, governments working directly with GAVI and that they have openly talked about depopulation through vaccination as a long term agenda and things like the Georgia guidestones (Rockefeller) also stating mass depopulation it is not beyond reality that in combination with the media, owned governments, a PCR test that can be manipulated to give you exactly the results you desire from it, mass testing of a healthy population (never done before) and you are bound to find a casedemic as they are numbers never been exposed to the public before and they look frightening until you realise that the numbers are exactly in line with a normal flu season which is why there is around average deaths over the past 10 years. </p>
<p>The timing is convenient to get Biden in office (don’t let a good crisis go to waste and just coincidence of course that all the previous sars/murs/swine flu/bird flu all occur in election years)) and Fauci has got form for creating and testing new and more contagious coronavirus (this was deemed too dangerous and unethical by Obama so operations were moved to wuhan which fauci funded), Wuhan lab just another coincidence though.</p>
<p>It can be summed up even easier than all this. Just look at who profits from this “crisis” and there is your answer.</p>
<p>Whilst we are distracted by scotch eggs and clapping for captain Tom we are inprisoned by a fascist dictatorship with no end in sight where the only answer for a mild flu like virus is to remove all human rights, deliberately destroy the economy for generations, vaccinate with an experimental concoction, end all socialisation, implement more mass surveillance and control (ID cards/ vaccine passports) destroy families, let old people die alone without family, stop kids going to school  and for what.</p>
<p>This is a war on humanity and it is terrifying that people still thing this is “for our safety”. We are told it is so strict as we are “following the science” but when science states that PCR tests are fraudulent and not fit for purpose and that lockdowns don’t work and marks are useless suddenly we are not the following THE science but following THEIR “science” where questions are not allowed and cult like obedience is demanded.</p>
<p>We might have always been slaves to the system  but never subjects of philanthropists wet dreams of vaccines and depopulation. </p>
<p>We have sleepwalked into this tyranny and they are taking full advantage of it. They move the goalposts every two minutes and they have a behavioural insights team that is purely designed purely to manipulate the population into compliance, and hello to 77th brigade!!! </p>
<p>They are not even talking about a return to normal anymore, that is it. It is over. All empires collapse eventually. All those dystopian films you have seen over the years (anyone seen songbird recently?) and it has not been a secret, the only surprise is how easy it is to control a planet through fear. But what we should truly be fearful of is what is coming next, 1 million down 6 Billion to go.</p>

        <p>Hysteria pure and simple.</p>
<p>As an example, Australia had mask mandates and lockdowns and look where they are now. New South Wales has had 18 days of zero cases of community transmission and they are effectively back to normal. Other than wearing masks on public transport, all the businesses are open and people are going out to restaurants and bars. No totalitarian government over-reach, just a rational response to an emergency situation.</p>
<p>You have never had pure unfettered freedom. All societies place rules on what you can and can't do - from stealing to speeding to fighting and guess what, you go to jail if your transgressions are big enough. This is a foundational aspect of the social contract.</p>
<p>And to say that it's under any justification is patently absurd. This is the worst pandemic in living memory and yet people complain that things aren't like normal because, guess what, the whole world is not like normal and to pretend otherwise is criminally negligent.</p>
<p>Your whinging disgusts me. There are front line medical workers putting their lives on the line and ignorant morons either want to stick their head in the sand or use it to justify their conspiracy fantasies.</p>

        <p>You need me to explain something as basic as something being highly infectious and having a high mortality being worse than something that is only one of those and not the other? That's a fairly low bar even for this subreddit.</p>
<p>How about you start here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557974/ and read the very first paragraph "The effects of influenza on a population are attributable to the clinical severity of illness and the number of persons infected, which can vary greatly between seasons or pandemics."</p>
<p>Do you now agree with my statement?</p>
