    <strong>New York Times admits Corona is getting its Mutant powers from the bodies of the Vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/01/us/covid-santa-monica-icu.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage">NY Times article</a></p>
<p>Heres the part of particular interest. </p>
<p>"While vaccinated people appear to be getting far less sick from infections, the superior powers of the Delta variant are allowing the virus to proliferate in their systems and to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/health/cdc-vaccinated-delta.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage"> </a>spread, lethally, to the unvaccinated."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Im just a regular Joe. But this scamdemic has accidentally tipped Big Pharma's hand. Using our internet degrees, we all pretty much realize there were no reported mutations until the vaccines came out. Then they introduce a new vax tech with mRNA tomfoolery, and now several variants. We're going to see the L Loki variant pretty soon. Sorry, I need my sense of humor when talking about things Im deadly fucking serious about. </p>
<p>It appears the vaccine is literally the cause of these mutations IN THE BODIES OF THE VACCINATED. The vaccine will be the end of many more of us. The mRNA vaccine may bring about a TRUE pandemic with the death toll hitting every family, and 50% or more of your family going down within this decade if the variants are allowed to run wild. Their answer to this is likely going to be new booster shots. I think we can just imagine the holy hell that will cause. We already know what the leaky spike proteins are doing. </p>
<p>Im honestly confused why certain vaccines really do work, and are one and done, and yet vaccines like the flu shot and now Corona are chasing its tail, always a year behind. If we use the flu as a model, could it be that the flu shot has kept the flu alive all these decades? If we stop the flu shots, will it lose its ability to mutate in the vaccinated and keep going? If we stop the corona vaccine, will Corona stop mutating?</p>
<p>What Im about to say is deadly fucking serious, and the course of action is ONLY to be taken when certain countrywide conditions are met. Big Pharma may NEVER admit their vaccines are the reason viruses like Corona can mutate. If they continue their booster shot plan and keep a new shot going every year, they may literally kill 75% of the global population that once lived healthy in 2019. </p>
<p>IF American (and any other country that reads this and wants to do the same) society LITERALLY falls apart because of the mass deaths hitting everyone, and IF the scientists and Big Pharma dont come to their senses and stop the vaccines on their own, then the Militia must reform and take aggressive action against the vaccine. Those who are still remaining, if the country has fallen apart, and its literal pandemonium in the streets because of out of control variants, you must DESTROY vaccine production and destroy EVERY supply of it like a fucking Revenuer looking for alcohol. That means armed invasions of hospitals, clinics, and store pharmacies, forcing them to hand over the vaccines for destruction. That means armed invasions of vaccine manufacturing plants. You dont need to kill anyone in these locations, a show of force will be enough, and if you overwhelm local law enforcement, if its even still functioning in that month, there will be little resistance. If it takes burning down vaccine manufacturing plants, so be it. </p>
<p>Im not calling for this action any time soon. Because you know, terrorism charges and all that. Youll know the day you need to rise up and act. When that day comes, society will likely have already devolved into literal Civil War, with one side killing each other, blaming them for the variants. While the scared and angry are out killing each other, groups of smart people need to carry out these strikes against the vaccine and its spike protein super power giving ability if the government is still trying to distribute that shit, and all you have noticed is the variants are just running wild and deadlier year after year. I may not be around to start this contingency plan myself. Who knows if the virus gets me too, I havnt had it yet. Read this, remember it. Use your common sense.  </p>
<p>The government has shown they are NOT looking out for our health. We have the evidence the vaccine is making things worse right before our eyes. Theyre already admitting it, even in liberal rags, yet enforcing the vax left and right to work jobs and travel. If the governments wont save us, and stays on the Big pharma payroll making things progressively worse year after year with this particular virus, then this strike plan against the vaccine production must be taken.   </p>
<p>For now we can only cross our fingers, hope Big Pharma and Big Science comes to its fucking senses and fixes the shit they unleashed on the world, and hopefully our natural immunity saves most of us, and the mRNA spike protein powered super variants arent enough to kill 50% or more of us in a true pandemic. Ive always said I'll play nice and maintain my perfect spotless criminal record until shit gets really real. When each of us notice 50% or more of our family and friends going down to Corona, Shit is officially Real then. That is the day you act to Save Humanity.</p></p>

        <p>I've been hearing that the vaccinated are just going to help create a version that is heavily resistant towards vaccine technology. </p>
<p>Of course big pharma seems to be wanting to move into a booster shot industry that can also aid in the rise of vaccine passports/digital id's, social credit type system with top down control over movement and resource management.</p>

        <p>If you criticize the government in any why they will bar you from receiving that year's booster. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They will not kill you, but they will turn their back on you as you die to the super-mutant that they created.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I believe the reason is that this vaccine is not a sterilizing vaccine like some others. All it really seems to do is suppress symptoms in the recipient which makes them ideal super spreaders, ironically. Now they get infected and have no symptoms at all, had been given permission to go without masks and attend certain events and such, and are undoubtedly the reason for the mutation and creation of variants.</p>
