        <p>In the first 5 minutes of this video they discuss how in Florida the hospitals have stopped routinely asking patients if they've been vaccinated. Have even shredded past forms where people replied that they had been. This is how they're able to lie and state that everyone in there with Covid are unvaxed.  https://rumble.com/vk71s6-novavax-safe-alternative-to-pfizer-moderna-expert-reveals-dark-reality..html</p>

        <p>I live in the Smokey Mountains region of East Tennessee. We shutdown in April 2020 and reopened in May 2020. We were threatened and terrorized by almost everyone, I was banned from a sub and received death threats in messages, as I felt the shutdown was harmful to our immigrant community and small businesses. We have not seen the massive death and destruction predicted by the doomsday cult, vice versa, we have seen an influx of western and northern refugees relocating to the volunteer state... Because we volunteer, we are free to have choices. When the Confederacy tried to force East Tennessee to give conscripts to the Confederate army, East Tennessee resisted and a hostile army occupied Knoxville, which led to the city begging President Lincoln for liberation. This is also why Lincoln chose Johnson as his Vice from Greeneville. Many East Tennesseans volunteered for the Union army, to liberate their beloved people from an unjust tyranny. I hope we will always be soldiers in the war against authority and illegal laws being imposed on vulnerable people. We are mountain people and we should always rely on ourselves, rather than a government which claimed DDT and Agent Orange were safe, a government which filmed testing nuclear devices on patriots during WW2. East Tennessee is alive and thriving, bring your business and money here, where you can volunteer to live!</p>

        <p>I have been in the smokey mountains the past week on vacation doing literally every indoor and crowded outdoor event-and let me tell you. it's crowded! Barely any masks, it's so awesome. I feel like the pandemic never happened almost ( although I know people here were impacted too by forced closures). But yes, amazing place! Would feel very safe here if war broke out as people seem like they'd fight back.</p>
