        <p>It's so fucked up that it seems the only/ or strongest way to break through the brainwashing of the vaccinated is for them to personally experience the fucked up side effects of these experimental vaccines... I wish that they could wake up before their life is severely threatened and altered forever by these unapproved fda experimental jabs. How do they not realize they are the guinea pigs?</p>

        <p>That's an unfortunate truth :/ </p>
<p>What do you think it would/will take for the vaccinated to break free of their brainwashing? Or other phrased, what will it take for the brainwashing to break?</p>

        <p>Issue with most people on the left is that they are evil deep down.. and I don't say that lightly.. but they truly are.. they lack the basic ability to care about othe..</p>
<p>Unless something personally affects them they simply do not care.. they may ask this with phony "compassion"™</p>
<p>But really outside of the virtue signaling the only actual policies they push where were designed to benefit themselves and no one else. I think it was even George Orwell the Socialist who said that the average socialist is not motivated out of a sympathy for the poor but rather of a hatred for the rich..</p>
<p>That the average truly poor person is not usually a socialist. It's usually the middle class looking to get a leg up on the upper class</p>
<p>A liberal is a selfish person that only cares about things that affect him. They do not care that people were struggling throughout the country due to their own necessary lock down. But when it came time for their BLM parties or to go out drinking suddenly it doesn't matter..</p>
<p>I've seen them in person.. the same people that will scream at you on the internet for not wearing a mask at the grocery store and I see them in person going to parties and dancing at bars without any such masking..</p>
<p>You have to recognize that these are not normal people</p>
<p>Giving them the largest benefit of the doubt you can possibly give you would still have to say that they're essentially just children and the mistake that a lot of people made was letting the inmates run the asylum.</p>

        <p>I was a liberal in my 20's and you are right. I'm ashamed to admit all of this, but I hated things just because they were based in tradition and religion. I always said I hated people who were patriotic. And I only defended actions that were basically deviant. I thought that pleasure in the present was more important than the future and that short term happiness was real happiness. I made a transition into libertarianism because they believed that people should not get in trouble for partaking in drug use (I still believe that). But what I didn't expect is that I would learn about morality too. And as I matured, I realized the way I lived was a lie that created more suffering than happiness. I can see my old self in some of these people so I know exactly what they are about. The only difference is that I may have been able to call myself a "rebel" in that time period. They cannot. They are the dominant force and they aren't rebelling against anything. The government is on their side, corporations, celebs. Even the head of the Catholic Church. They are, as Sam Tripoli would say, Raging on behalf of the machine.</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing your perspective/insights!!</p>
<p>I don't like to throw around the label "evil" lightly as well, and I have been trying to give the Left some benefit of the doubt.
. But this reconfirmed a lot of the thoughts I've been contemplating. Thank you.</p>

        <p>Many people who take the vaccine who will have some sort or severe reaction will still insist that they are happy that they took it, because they are safe from covid, or that whatever the symptoms they have, it beats having long-covid...like WTF? I would be terrified of any adverse reaction for my long term health, but people are such imbeciles, they believe something that is meant to be medicinal making you feel bad is good.</p>

<p>Don't underestimate the pure manipulative behavior of the medical establishment.  You can bet every single doctor who saw this woman took time to reinforce the idea that even though she's suffering madly,  getting the vaccine was the right thing to do...  not because they believe that,  but because they know they fucked this womans life up and they want to assuage their own guilt over it...  and medical ethics basically don't exist anymore.</p>

        <p>Anyone stupid enough to be injected with this garbage will suffer the consequences of it sooner or later. One obvious point needs to be made here though. These brainwashed morons will blame everyone who is awake for any damage that occurs. All of us who know this is a giant scam will either be blamed for refusing to take the poison ourselves, or blamed for supposedly not doing enough to warn the sheep not to take the shit. In a couple months when you can't buy groceries without a "vaccine passport", make sure you remember who is responsible for this endless tyranny. The sheep will need to be made an example of, one way or another.</p>

        <p>&rt; Covid's death rate is literally 1,000 times as high as that. </p>
<p>At the start of the pandemic before we knew there were treatments?  Sure.  We have treatments,  we know they work,  yet we're still not using them.  That figure is artificially inflated by sheer medical incompetence.  There's a good chance that <em>with proper treatment</em> COVID will be more survivable than the vaccine.</p>

<p>There is literally no evidence to back up that claim, and it is provably false. The death rate is still hovering around 1-2% even with the best medicine. At no point has the covid fatality rate ever approached being as low as .0017%</p>

        <p>That's fine, I can't 'make' you believe something you don't want to believe, but even if you don't, your statement is still completely unsubstantiated. The vaccine IS 'proper treatment' of Covid. Unless there's some magical other new drug out there that is for some reason less scary than the vaccine even though it's certainly had the same amount of time and data behind it?</p>

        <p>Lol y’all are hilarious, I agree. However it would be interesting to see who made the picture, I guess someone who was with her at the incident and took or went with them to the hospital. Mystery solved?</p>

        <p>I've had a nurse hit a nerve giving me an IM shot. I wasn't able to lift my arm for two weeks and the bruising was so nasty. I was a waitress at the time and had to hold the trays by my hip. I called them when I realized something was wrong and was told repeatedly that it was NOT the shot. Not the nerve pain and not the bruising. I will never get over that and it happened at least 20 yrs ago.</p>

        <p>It is a very serious virus for just some. We know some of who the some are, but not all. But we also know that there are extremely effective treatments that if given early in the progression, are 100% effective. There is no need to die from this virus unless you wait until it's too late, which was the early fatal advice. Or your government prevents you from using the proven effective treatments.</p>

        <p>Every vaccine and every drug has its side effects. Everything from painkillers to contraceptive pills have side effects, often more common and worse than with the relatively new covid-vaccines. They barely get talked about, since they’re used across the world every day. Thrombosis, which some people experienced after taking the AstraZeneca-vaccine, appears in roughly 1 out of 250 000 cases, while it appears in as many as 1 out of 1000 cases of people using contraceptive pills. https://theconversation.com/blood-clot-risks-comparing-the-astrazeneca-vaccine-and-the-contraceptive-pill-158652 . This was simply an example to show that yes, side effects are a very real risk of covid-vaccines, however, they’re in no way new to covid-vaccines, and this post makes it seem like side effects with drugs or vaccines are unheard of.</p>
