    <strong>this is not a pandemic, this is class war.</strong>
    <p><p>a kilogram of Anthrax is enough to topple a large city in under a week, in addition to this we know what Anthrax does to a human, how it kills one and we have footage of people suffering from Anthrax. same goes for any other actually dangerous disease. but with Corona none of these things are true, the "pandemic" has gone on for two years already and the cities are mostly running just fine, of course people have to stay inside and that does damage the economy but they still have electricity, they still have sewage and emergency services. if corona was actually dangerous we would have already seen some The Division style apocalypse where Washington DC goes silent and stays abandoned for several months with only some bandits and wild animals roaming around the streets.</p>
<p>but what has happened is class war, the billionaires have been looting the economy as much as they can (even Bezos trying to go to space on his shitty dildo rocket). if this disease would have been actually dangerous the system would have collapsed and the likes of Bezos and Gates would have disappeared from the image a long time ago. when people started losing their jobs they should have been offered relief on things like rent, food and utilities. but there was nothing, working class was just expected to manage in the economic turmoil while the billionaires are indulging in the state's money.</p>
<p>people really need to wake up to this shit because even a million vaccines will not fix this situation (it's likely that most of it is just saline anyways), the billionaires will continue to loot the economy and hoard wealth for their frivolous little projects until the actual end of the world if we the working class wont do anything about it.</p></p>

        <p>that fact that all the doctors and nurses aren't dead is the giveaway</p>
<p>as for 'classes' there are only 2. owners and slaves. there are 2 types of slaves, overseers are one and you are the other</p>
<p>the billionaire's frivolous little project is the formal and open enslavement of mankind, where the slaves enslave  themselves and are happy because  the greater good</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>this is what jezzies wrapping up the counter-reformation looks like</p>

        <p>Sadly, itâ€™s worse than that. When people began losing their jobs, the government stepped in and shut down the economy, effectively FORCING people into joblessness. The government pushed everyone into desperation on purpose!</p>

        <p>Anthrax was used to phase out postal system and push digital communications, while fear-mongering senders could lace the post with anthrax. Covid is now used in the same way, to phase out cash and push digital systems and surveillance. We've been fooled, twice.</p>

        <p>Our planet is not doing so well. Population directly equates to how rapidly it gets worse, and my deduction is this deterioration we are seeing as of late has now gotten noticed... yeah I'm fully expecting 2021 has barely rolled its sleeves up</p>
