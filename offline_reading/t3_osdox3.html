    <strong>Will there ever be a tipping point?</strong>
    <p><p>It seems like everyone who cares about freedom of choice and being able to make your own decisions are losing ground day by day. All anyone ever does is get into pissing matches with each other online about which side they're entrenched in. Nobody is going to change their mind no matter how much your argue with them. Meanwhile personal freedoms are being stripped away day by day. Anyone who can think rationally for more than two seconds can see all these measures and laws are going to end up exactly the same as the Patriot Act. It will never go away. You have people going "Haha good" whenever someone dies these days. The whole my tribe versus yours is in full effect and those in power got exactly what they wanted. The ability to exploit fear to the absolute maximum and accelerate us all towards Chinese bugmen social credit score. Countries like France are trying to make it so you can't even go buy food unless you've done as you're told by the government. It took all of one month for media to make people go from "I'm vaccinated, I'm not worried about what those other idiots do", to "Get vaccinated or die you selfish pricks!". Businesses and peoples' livelihoods can be flipped on their head with no legislation beyond a mandate by those who don't even follow their own rules that they put in place.</p>
<p>What is the pushback? Some people complaining on facebook. Some funny memes? Will a large amount of people somehow make it stop or is the great reset pretty much assured at this point?</p></p>

        <p>Europe just had some crazy protests. The lawsuits have started as well. Most people will still be mostly peaceful until their back really is against the wall. At the rate we are going that might be a year from now.</p>

        <p>I've lost faith in protests and any form of bureaucratic litigation changing much. Just look what happened in Virginia when they passed draconian gun laws. A bunch of heavily armed people showed up to protest, were told to go home by police and then did just that. So I have even less hope for people whose only available tool to protest with is a sign with words painted on it. It's akin to shouting "I don't like this, please stop!". Why would they stop unless physically forced to which never happens.</p>

        <p>I think theres 3 possible breaking points that could happen in America:</p>
<ol>
<li>They try to take away our guns</li>
<li>They mandate the vaccine</li>
<li>Vaccine passports are introduced</li>

        <p>I wish they'd try number 1, it'd be the only thing crazy enough to actually back people so far into a corner they'd actually have to take action. Those in power are smart enough to just slowly chip away at various pieces and restrict ammo. Numbers 2 and 3 I dont think anyone would do anything beyond complain and protest, then just accept their fate. It's already extremely close to those in America and actually happening in other first world countries, yet no major backlash beyond complaints.</p>
