    <strong>Will UK business owners be brave enough to open this Saturday? "The Great Reopening UK, Saturday, January 30"</strong>
    <p><p>In response to the great success achieved in Italy a few weeks back (where thousands of businesses successfully opened their doors in protest of the harsh lockdown restrictions), organisers in the UK are doing their best to drive awareness towards a nation-wide event set to happen this coming Saturday, entitled "The Great Reopening".  It's difficult to foresee whether or not business owners will have the courage to defy the government's rules considering the level of financial support being offered (not for everyone though), however I truly hope they do.  That being said, this will by no means be a one-off event, so regardless of the participation turn-out this Saturday, awareness is key moving forward. Over the past four days there has been a substantial amount of effort getting the word out in addition to collating legal documentation and templates for businesses to use (see legal notice). They can't fine everyone, as there is an insane backlog in the UK courts at the moment, apparently something like 500,000 cases, I gather. <a href="https://rifnote.com/2021/01/24/salon-owner-who-racked-up-17k-in-fines-for-flouting-covid-rules-insists-she-will-reopen-next-week/">Salon owner Sinead Quinn</a> in Bradford insists she will open this Saturday regardless of the Â£17,000 worth of fines she has been given by police over the last few moths, none of which she has paid. </p>
<p>If you are a business owner in the UK (or know someone who is) and would like to open your shop on Saturday please email to organiser: <a href="mailto:Thegreatreopening@protonmail.com">Thegreatreopening@protonmail.com</a> </p>
