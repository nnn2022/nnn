    <strong>Nurse tried to tell me fake COVID-19 death sob story to convince me to vaccinate</strong>
    <p><p>I was hospitalized this past week for pancreatitis and the nurses have to ask if we’ve been vaccinated or plan to. When I said no I haven’t and no I don’t plan to, my nurse went into this sob story about how when she was working on the COVID-19 unit in the hospital she witnessed some of the most heartbreaking things. She detailed a story about a 90- something year old gentleman who died after she had “just spoke to him” and he was “sitting up in a chair!” However, her narrative of a surprise covid death doesn’t add up when I considered these other facts of her story.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The gentleman’s age. I’m sorry but it’s never a shock when someone in their 90s dies, especially when they’ve contracted an illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She mentioned he chose to remove his oxygen after the doctor told him he had a “90-95%” chance of dying. This statement invalidates her claim of a surprise death. The man knew he was knocking at deaths door and chose to not further his pain. My uncle passed of COPD complications last summer and did something similar when he realized that he had no other options.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Someone who didn’t critically think would’ve bought into this BS and possibly vaccinated because of the guilt tripping and fear mongering. I’m so over the false propaganda.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. The second I sense any manipulation, I’m out. Maybe I’m too cynical for my own good, but out of spite if you try to insult my intelligence by emotionally manipulating me, I will never hear another word you say</p>

<p>Also 90 years old is a good long life. I don’t know why people act surprised when 90 year olds die. What did you think was going to happen?</p>

        <p>HiS liFe WaS CuT ShoRt BecAuSe oF CoviD. </p>
<p>My grandpa died 2 years years ago because he fell on a carpeted floor and hit his head. Didn’t do anything about it for a few days and then found out he had a brain hemorrhage. He was pretty healthy overall for his age and could have lived another 5 years who knows? But that’s the way it goes. Regardless he lived 91 fucking years. </p>
<p>Luckily this was before the lunacy of today. And I could be there during his last breath in hospice so he didn’t have to go out alone.</p>

        <p>Guy on my hockey team was justifying getting the vaccine because so many people around him are dead now from covid. Funny thing is, no one even was challenging him on getting it. He had to make up this reasoning to justify getting the vaccine. Funny thing is, I don't think he has lost many people due to covid... I kept my mouth shut on the issue, just incase.</p>

        <p>This is why they say it.  It can't be challenged for fear of insensitivity and guilt.  </p>
<p>To be clear, I only call these people out online.  Or, make sure to be super sensitive in real life.  "I'm so sorry for your loss.  Was it someone close to you?  How old?".  Kind of thing.</p>

        <p>Dude, when my aunt died in a car crash and COVID was written on the death certificate, it took me 3 months to be able to talk about it, from the shock. I haven't been able to write it anywhere on social media or anything, cause its too personal to me and one single attack or ignorant word would feel crushing, since I loved her very much. Only my closest friends know about it, I wrote it once here on this sub and reading a couple of dismissing comments was very hurtful, I didn't use reddit for a couple of months after that.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is, I don't absolutely think that someone who has lost close people around him is going to go "oh you know I've lost some friends too lol" that's when you know they're lying. I have a friend who's father died last year and yet he's not able to talk about it.</p>
<p>People who go on reddit/socials and go "my cousin died, now wear a mask" there's a 99.9% chance they're lying.</p>

        <p>actually, my cousin did die. and they did blame covid. I think they're full of shit tho, because she was pretty unhealthy and overweight to begin with. and the last time I Saw her she didnt look very good.</p>
<p>we were not close. and it does not bother me one bit to talk about it. I'm not changing my lifestyle based on a lie in a coroners report.</p>

<p>You clearly have no idea how normal human interaction works if to you 1 in 500 is a scary number of people to get sick and die. That's not a friends and family number or even a coworkers and business acquaintances number, it's a random person on your Facebook list number. You mean to tell me if you heard through the grapevine that Bill from grade 10 math class who you haven't spoken to in over a decade died you would fall apart and freak out? No you would not. Even if you're the kind of weirdo who cries at movies you would be like oh, ok, that sucks. And carry on with your day. You certainly wouldn't demand the whole world shut down so whatever Bill from grade 10 math died of can disappear.</p>
<p>Hence why it's commonplace for people in the real world to not know a single person who's been seriously sick let alone die, and why sensible people call bullshit when half of Reddit claims it's killed their whole family of marathon runners or whatever ridiculous lie the people who post on forums like this are in the habit of circulating.</p>
<p>Tldr the likelihood of "my entire family" dying of corona is slim to nil. It doesn't happen to "entire families" it happens to Bill from grade 10 math class, and almost exclusively the fattest and oldest Bills from grade 10 math class.</p>
<p>You and I and everyone else don't give a fuck about Bill from grade 10 math class. If he wasn't on your Facebook you wouldn't even remember he existed.</p>

        <p>Yep. I had an aunt pass away last year and it was diagnosed as a "Covid" death. Woman been I'll of something since the 90's. Told my parents about the March 23rd, 2020 NVSS memo re:diagnoses and tried to tell my parents not to believe Covid didn't kill her and they damn near tried to kill me for saying it.</p>
<p>Take note: this covid story, as fictional as it is, is a very emotional point amongst black people...because they're emotional about every damn thing. I was having an extremely difficult time trying to get them to at least acknowledge the inconsistencies and contradictions the very people they are listening to regarding this "disease" are saying. So I don't even bother anymore.</p>

        <p>All you wrote in your satire comment was basically "people are lying about the covid to make it sound like a crisis" and "vaccine bad". Since those things are definitely true, it's not surprising at all that a few voters bought into it.
Maybe you should find a different sub to troll?</p>

        <p>My 94, turning 95 this summer great aunt is driving my family crazy because she keeps avoiding vaccination appointments and it's low key hilarious. Due to her age she's been eligible since like early February and had multiple appointments people made for her that she cancelled or no showed. She's pretty tough and won't let others make that decision for her. I don't think I would want the vaccine at her age either, having outlived some of her children and all of her siblings by decades. Her younger brother, my grandfather, died in the 70s.</p>
<p>Its really almost never a surprise, or even necessarily a sad thing, when someone in their 90s passes away from natural causes. Nothing but respect to you for your choice and I hope that others respect them as well, and that you're doing alright with the pancreatitis</p>

        <p>Totally. Most of them are just followers too, so if you try to question them individually, they can only regurgitate talking points they heard on social media. Just like they’re teaching the kids in school... “display the thinking we tell you to, or you’re ostracized from the group.” As more people begin taking a non-traditional approach to education, I’m hoping the worst teachers will lose their jobs and go into something else.</p>

        <p>Remember, about 1 in 500 people in the US have died with (not from) covid. </p>
<p>So to know multiple people that died with (not from) covid, you have to multiply by 500 each additional person they claim to know that have died with (not from) covid. </p>
<p>So the chances of knowing 2 people who died with (not from) covid are 1/250,000. To know 3 would be 1/125,000,000.</p>

        <p>That’s not a correct use of that stat. </p>
<p>Deaths are concentrated in the elderly, and the elderly are often concentrated (nursing homes, Florida, etc). Anyone who interacts with these concentrated groups is far more likely to see covid deaths (and anyone who doesn’t is far less likely). </p>
<p>Same reasoning for working in healthcare: higher exposure to sick/old people means you’re more likely to see multiple covid deaths.</p>

        <p>How is this horrible use of statistics upvoted? </p>
<p>If you live in a small town of 2000 it's not unreasonable to know all of them, if not personally at least you know a friend or close relative of them. Among 2000 people chosen on random in the US there will be on average 4 covid fatalities (2000/500=4).</p>
<p>Just to exemplify how bad this person's math is:</p>
<p>People above 85 years of age total less than 2% of the US population. That's about 1 in 50. By PressureMediocre's logic, the chance of knowing 2 people above 85 is 1/2500. Knowing 3 is 1/125000, knowing 4 is 1/6250000. And knowing 5 people above 85 years of age should be 1 in 312 <strong>million</strong>. At most one person in the US should know 5 people aged 85 or older. Knowing 6 oldies is nigh on impossible.</p>

        <p>&rt;Someone has never taken a prob and stat class.</p>
<p>You've probably only taken an intro level class.</p>
<p>Because he is correct, your use of probability to calculate the probability of an individual knowing two COVID-19 positive individuals was pretty abysmal.</p>
<p>You treated it using the very basic multiplication of a set probability, which is an assumption which wouldn't fit real-world values in the least bit.</p>
<p>A better model would be something akin to a Poisson Regression model, which involves rates to calculate the odds of getting various counts.</p>

        <p>Good job not caving in. Nurses are quick to give a sob story or scold you for not conforming to their wishes. Had a nurse get angry at me when I was questioning her what type of dye they planned on using for an x-ray. It's like my body was her property and I shouldn't ask any questions. It's funny because people can ask what is in their food at a restaurant, but don't dare ask what they are going to inject you with.</p>

        <p>Good grief. And if anecdotes are the way they want to go, I have one too: my sister is in training to become a nurse. She <em>volunteered</em> to work on the COVID unit at her hospital because she's not afraid of it and wanted to know what was going on there. She said she actually liked it better than the other work because it was pretty chill and quiet since most people weren't allowed in. And then pretty soon after, they closed that COVID unit down because they weren't getting enough patients who needed it.</p>

        <p>I've been in and out of the hospital a ton this year, mostly for my dad and his kidney issues that started in January.</p>
<p>Nurses have gotten so fucking awful.  He was telling me how they totally ignored him.  Wouldn't get his paperwork when he was discharged, both times, made my sister wait in the parking lot for 2 hours because the nurse didn't feel like doing it.  They wouldn't clean his roommate, who shit himself horribly, then threw the blankets out in the trash and wouldn't get rid of the bag even though it stunk the whole room up.  They were bullshitting in the hall instead.</p>
<p>This is a high end hospital in Pittsburgh, we have amazing hospitals out here in general and my experience was always positive with the staff.  Until now.  There is this air of entitlement they have, and their jobs seem safe regardless of how much of a shit job they do.  Just the nurses though.  Doctors seem fine, as do the techs.  But the nurses suck some ass.</p>

        <p>Yes I did, like other commenters said in their experiences calling people out, she was left dumbfounded, speechless and gave me sub par care the rest of the night. I am considering reporting her, but the particular hospital I was at is big into vaccine propaganda, literally billboards all over town promoting it, so I feel a complaint to their patient relations department would be fruitless.</p>

        <p>I saw something on social media the other day, some woman's daughter is a nurse in a covid ward and supposedly comes home broken and exhausted, crying after every shift because she's seen so many people die. Just during her last shift 4 people died of covid in the hospital where she works. I thought wow, that's pretty bad, let me just see what's the situation like in this country. According to worldometers there's an average of 8 deaths per day in the whole country and that's been the case for a couple of weeks now. They also have more than 150 hospitals so how likely is it that in the past 24 hours 4 of the 8 people that died, died in that particular hospital?</p>
<p>It's a quite wealthy country so I'm sure that not only the hospitals there are amazing but also the staff is paid extremely well.</p>
<p>This woman is just some rando, not someone who feels like they need to lie because they have a lot of friends and followers. She can't be doing it for clicks but then again you never know.</p>
<p>So my question is, could the daughter be lying to her mother? Has she been encouraged to exaggerate the situation at her workplace or is she doing it for attention? Because that's borderline criminal. It's just extremely unlikely that out of 8, 10, 12 deaths or whatever, 4 would happen in one particular hospital. </p>
<p>Why are they doing this?</p>

        <p>My friend recently adopted a parrot because her grandmother “died of COVID”.</p>
<p>No, she was in the advanced stages of dementia and already in a nursing home and in the mid-90s... before COVID, these people had average life expectancies at this point of only several months.</p>
<p>It is absolutely heartbreaking to have family members pass away but it strikes me as if death and mortality is something that they have truly not contemplated deeply before COVID.</p>
<p>It’s like COVID has made people realise that people die and now rather than try and soak up every moment of life to make the journey worthwhile because it can end at any moment, they’re convinced if they just stay home and stay safe they can live forever?</p>
<p>Your death is guaranteed, make peace with it and live to the fullest. There’s no point living how we have done so for the last twelve months for the long term and I hope more understand this.</p>
