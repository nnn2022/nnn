    <strong>Does anyone notice that stores treat us like we’re children now?</strong>
    <p><p>We have to first of all obey the mask policy. Of you don’t even cover your notice they’ll harass you. </p>
<p>They make you wait in line to get in. </p>
<p>You make you stand on certain sports marked on the ground. It’s like you’re coming back from recess in elementary school in stand on your designated number. </p>
<p>They blare in the creepy loudspeaker voice please wear a mask and social distance. Very Orwellian. </p>
<p>They ask you what you’re looking for and make you only go to that section. </p>
<p>When returning a product to a store you have to follow an employee who follows a line on the ground to get the the spot. </p>
<p>They’ll make you stand diagonal in an elevator. </p>
<p>Remember guys we just need to two weeks to flatten the curve.</p></p>

<p>Instead of "Obey if you want to fly today", it's "Obey if you want to shop today".</p>

        <p>For sure. I was at an art supply store the other day. Attempted a mask-less shopping time, and it was all good until I got to the register. The little girl behind the register (and her plexiglass) wouldn’t even beckon me to her open register when I was next in line. I could tell why, so I pulled my bandana up, under my nose (because I’m not sick) and she gives me a shitty little, “that needs to go over your nose.” </p>
<p>The funniest part of it is that she still picked up the supplies I was buying (that mere moments before were in my hands) to scan them without even thinking about it! I don’t know if it was obvious to her but it was to me that she just saw her opportunity be a little c-word to someone she would probably never dare be a c-word to in regular life. And she got to feel powerful bossing someone around who she probably decided is a horrible person. </p>
<p>And the worst part of all of it, is that her attitude made ME have attitude to her and I NEVER have attitude with people. I am a very sensitive and kind person who now is thought of as a selfish bitch. It’s all so awful what this is doing to us as humans, it is truly soul crushing.</p>

        <p>I went shopping without a mask in LA once. I just didn’t have one. Everyone stared, people walked to avoid me like I had a gun and I heard crap being said about me. </p>
<p>When I went to go pay they wouldn’t serve Metz I offered to buy a mask and they said no. They held up the line to find me a mask. Took them awhile. They could’ve rung up me and 10 other single item people behind me. They then wasted another 5 mins scrubbing the counter holding up the line more. </p>
<p>I saw this has happened to other commenters as well.</p>

        <p>Yes, the residents of Los Angeles have gone 100% insane. They are confirmed afraid of faces and the lengths they will go to stop seeing a face are wild. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: sometimes I’m truly convinced that I died in March of 2020 and now I’m just a ghost living in some kind of bizzaro-world purgatory.</p>

        <p>I have friends in la who are super rich and they are afraid to leave their house. Some haven’t in 3 months not that they need too in their secluded estates. The haven’t had dinner with or hugged their parents since March.</p>
<p>One of my friends wants me to get tested so he can see me to watch football out an outdoor bar (he’s scared of indoor but doesn’t realize outdoor will jsut as crowded and 0 fucks given where I live) when I already have antibodies. I also don’t have rich person insurance so I can’t just go get a rapid inaccurate test when I want. </p>
<p>I legit know people who have been tested 20x. </p>
<p>It’s really turning early 20s kids into pussies.</p>

        <p>Many years ago I went to a shopping centre which had an automated voice playing on the loudspeaker near the escalators, saying "please mind your step" over and over on repeat. Small things like that paved the way for the current crisis - the store owners clearly thought this message was necessary or beneficial in some way (otherwise why spend the money to run it) and the customers probably just thought it was a harmless if not misguided attempt at looking out for their safety. Is the teeny tiny probability of somebody tripping on the escalator really worth the inconvenience of it all? This is not some high-tech large hadron collider teleportation device...it is a bog-standard escalator similar to the ones in every other big store on the planet. People don't need instructions blared at them! Of course, this just gets people accustomed to hearing and obeying automated directions (you're not really "obeying", everybody watches their step on the escalator, it's just common sense, but they make it seem like you're obeying).</p>

        <p>I'm tired of seeing all of the posters, masked people, policing people and ads everywhere. I fortunately don't have to deal with the annoying loudspeaker voices, which is an advantage of going "socially deaf". Much speech is incomprehensible for me, so I can just close my eyes if I'm tired of people's bs!</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's annoying. I don't get led to a section in my local stores, at least, and there are few social distancing announcements. The only ones I normally hear are half-hour reminders to the employees to go and wash their hands.</p>
