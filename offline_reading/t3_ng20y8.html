    <strong>What About Us Covid ‚ÄúSurvivors?‚Äù</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone noticed they don‚Äôt talk about us individuals who already had Covid and ‚Äúrecovered?‚Äù What freedoms do we get back? Do they think we‚Äôre all dead? I‚Äôm sitting here with antibodies wondering ‚Äúgee I wonder what I‚Äôm going to be allowed to do now...?‚Äù </p>
<p>It seems the options are vaxx or die at this point and I‚Äôm wondering if this means I can stop paying taxes since I‚Äôve been excluded from group. </p>
<p>But really, I‚Äôve been living an unvaxxed life since Jan 2020 and apparently have been dead since Jan 2021 when I lost my sense of taste for 4 weeks.</p></p>

        <p>All the online paid shills have friends and family who died of covid.</p>
<p>In reality, nobody knows anyone that really died of covid. My woman has thousands of facebook connections, literally nobody died covid, and for the first 6 months nobody even knew anyone with covid. Until they started the bs tests.</p>

        <p>Genuinely curious to know from people who have been told they had covid 19, but who also think this is a lot bigger than a virus and can see the absurdity, what makes you think it was a new virus you had and not a rebranded flu? You obviously know the flawed PCR, amplified cycles, no differentiating symptoms from other respiratory illness etc.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve had the flu ‚Äî&rt; fever, chills, fatigue, misery for like 2-3 days. </p>
<p>Covid ‚Äî&rt; lost sense of Taste, had small cough, 45 minute fever </p>
<p>So the biggest difference for me was with the flu, I felt actually ill and needed to be in bed. Covid was me still working (WFH since March 2020) and I couldn‚Äôt really find energy to do a home work out the first day but never lost any energy (like fatigue). </p>
<p>My husband got Covid and the only difference for him and the flu I described above was sense of taste loss and a cough. He was on his ass for a few days but that was it.</p>

        <p>I had it in March 2020. Hospitalized for 11 days, ICU for one day, no ventilator. Obviously I‚Äôm still alive, though there seems to be some residual heart damage (inverted T-wave).</p>
<p>Also, my hair stopped growing for six months, no fooling. That‚Äôs back to normal by now as well.</p>
<p>I earned those antibodies the hard way, damn it. Not getting stuck with anything.</p>

        <p>Thanks for clarifying. Absolutely not attempting to tell you what your body went through and I accept you felt they were 2 different types of illness but the symptoms all overlap i.e.  you could swap the words flu and covid in your description and it would still sound legitimate. 
There is nothing exclusive to covid. We know the pcr doesn't specifically test for covid so how do we know for sure its not the flu?</p>

        <p>We don‚Äôt. Honestly. It could have been Influenza type C for all I know. If I hadn‚Äôt lost my sense of taste, I‚Äôd have just assumed I had like a 24 hour cold/bug. </p>
<p>I never went and got a Covid test, but the whole ‚Äúsense of taste loss is the first sign!‚Äù made me assume. That and my husband DID have to get a PCR (so he could get out of work and not lose sick days) and it came back positive. My MiL brought it back to us from WI where she went for a funeral and her whole family up there masks religiously (so they say). </p>
<p>Oh and the 1.5 year old got it too. He had a fever (12 hours), a runny nose, a cough, and lost 0 energy...he got RSV about a week later and THAT was worse.</p>

        <p>I had it and I just felt weird? I thought I was coming down with a sinus infection one night when there was pressure on my sinuses and I felt run down. Next day I just felt kinda foggy but still had plenty of energy. I was going to work as a barista in a busy coffee shop for three days until suddenly I lost my sense of taste and smell. Went and got a swab test and lo and behold: covid positive. It was unlike any flu or cold I had ever had and it just felt so unnatural to be honest. All the symptoms were so localized, unlike with the flu or a cold where you feel kinda achy and tired everywhere. There was also no logical progression of the symptoms for me, like I felt okay and then all of a sudden my smell and taste were gone.</p>

        <p>That was my experience as well. I had it before there was any alarm about pandemic, late 2019. I worked a physical job, 5 10's a week for two weeks and never slowed down. I've had smoker's coughs worse.</p>

        <p>I had slight shortness of breath, fatigue (had to nap a couple of times a day) and dizziness. No fever.</p>
<p>The fatigue and dizziness lasted 3 days and I was out of breath when taking a walk, like when I used to smoke half a pack, for a total illness of 1 week.</p>
<p>Never had this combination of symptoms before, I always get body aches of the flu and sinus problems which did not happen here.</p>
<p>Overall it was milder and less annoying than any cold I ever had.</p>

        <p>I had a great aunt who died of COVID. She was 94, lived in a care home and most likely already had a weakened immune system due to a lack of exercise or outside exposure.</p>
<p>I've known others who have got really ill with it too, but to be honest I wonder if psychology comes into it. I had flu, maybe even COVID in December 2019 and felt really, really rough. If someone had that now the stress of "omg I'm going to die" might actually make the feeling of breathlessness worse.</p>

        <p>I doubt psychology comes into this. CoVid is... well... the only reasonable term is 'chaotic' in whom it sickens and kills. For every person with 4+ pre-existing conditions who gets it and gets severely ill, there is a person who no pre-existing conditions who gets it and gets severely ill.</p>
<p>It is crazy and I have never seen a virus act like this over the 40 years I have been alive on this planet.</p>

<p>and to confirm to non-believers like you, the PCR test was developed without any virus material. it's all pseudoscience, but you need to understand a bit what they are doing to see they are lying in our faces.</p>

        <p>I never made such a blanket statement (in fact I never even denied that it happened in Scotland - because it probably did). Just confirming that the one person I am connected to that died did not do so because of something non-covid related.</p>

        <p>That's the cause of my frustration. People I know being like "well I/my family member/our friend X got it and it was really bad for them!", well whooptie goddamn doo I guess? Sucks that they were an outlier, but you're bound to know at least one within the 6 degrees of separation. I havent gotten it, and the ones I know who have said it was basically an extra shitty cold. The numbers dont lie, this virus is far from "deadly" as the word it generally used. People are just dumb and think big numbers arent relative to other, much bigger numbers.</p>

        <p>I tested positive on Friday and I‚Äôve had a terrible headache for about two weeks now. I have no energy or appetite but I also have no temperature or lack of sense of smell or taste. I‚Äôve been pretty much asymptotic most of the time except for coughing and runny nose. I mean this does suck right now but I‚Äôve been worse from the regular flu...you said it lasted like 4 weeks though?

        <p>Start taking zinc, vitamin d, and vitamin c supplements. It lessens the time it takes for you to recover. I only lost my sense of smell for 4 days because my wife started stuffing me and the kids with vitamins once we all tested positive.</p>

        <p>Yup, natural immunity doesn‚Äôt sell vaccines. </p>
<p>‚ÄúYou can still get vaccinated even if you‚Äôve already recovered from Covid, so there‚Äôs literally no reason not to! Be a good little citizen and come get your sticker so society can accept you.‚Äù </p>
<p>This is what happens when adverse events aren‚Äôt taken seriously. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason to expose yourself to vaccine risks when you already have immunity. Not to mention, taking a vaccine with natural immunity increases the risk of ADE...immunity overload.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs coming. And the fearful populace (especially the terrified work from homers) are very happy about this. We have to speak up at every possible chance, and challenge these people. Almost all of them have not thought through the implications, and are literally just repeating the lines. We can‚Äôt let this happen. They‚Äôll keep saying ‚Äúwe always had vaccine passports lol‚Äù, but again, they‚Äôre just repeating the lines and not thinking. </p>
<p>I got my first shot and was given a little card. My prediction is that once people start getting the second shot, they will give out something a little more official, ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.</p>

        <p>Well to be honest, I'm surprised there hasn't been any blowback on the small samples of those surveyed who want vaccine passports. I'm a first generation Canadian so I would not have expected that type of reaction, but could be forgiven for misunderstanding this country. I think not of the Nazi Germany references that are often given, but on a simple populace control and surveillance level and that scares me. </p>
<p>My colleagues are talking about app development being the easiest to roll out and standardize and I'm the type of person who has been specifically avoiding the 'internet-of-things' and I think this would integrate much easier and have much more long-term implications than any kind of microchip implantation ideas I've seen float around.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm surprised, but also not surprised. For the vast majority of people, they don‚Äôt hear dissenting opinion. They read/listen to CBC, the star, and other ‚Äútrusted‚Äù news that only gives one opinion. It‚Äôs an example of the false consensus effect </p>
<p>Your Germany reference is pretty apt, but people shriek when you point it out. The fact is this: supporters of the nazis didn‚Äôt start down the slope wanting to do terrible things and to be one of the most murderous regimes in history. They were all nudged down the hill in the same manner: playing to greater moral good, unitary media, stifling of dissent, alienation/vilification of opposition (here, anyone who doesn‚Äôt want this regime is an ‚Äúantivaxxer who is contributing to KILLING PEOPLE).  Next is systemic discrimination of certain groups (can‚Äôt travel, go to the grocery store). </p>
<p>Like I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre going to put us into camps, but if should be wildly concerning that we are using the first 5 or so steps out of the genocide playbook. The people in Germany were led down a path where they earnestly believed that the problems in the country were because of the inferior races such as the Jews. They really believed this. In the same way the very afraid professional managerial class have been led to earnestly believe that anyone who questions lockdowns/vaccines are literally responsible for DEATH and destruction of the economy. If you honestly believe people are actively destroying your country, there‚Äôs no end to the cruelty you can subject them too. After all, in their mind, this is self defence. That is the exact logic used by the nazis, pol pot, Stalin, in Rwanda, and almost every other murderous regime in history</p>

        <p>I couldn't have said it better myself and I think to be more effective as a talking point it needs to be articulated in detail how they got to where they are. I know most humans have tweet-like attention spans right now, but I take for granted that most young people today are not being taught how these genocide or authoritarian movements emerged and how long they went unchecked to solve a perceived or created problem. I recently was teaching a group of teens who had never even heard of any of the atrocities you listed aside from the Nazis. They thought I was tricking them when we had a lesson on the Rwandan genocide.</p>

        <p>There are also people like me, who work in a "high risk" environment, who have not been sick or tested positive yet.  I work in a prison, that at one time, was listed as the most dangerous place in the country to work.  That is due to having close to 2500 inmates, and almost 1900 of them were positive for the rona at the same time.  Anyway, my point is, I've worked there through the whole plandemic, barely safeguarding myself.  I was actually hoping to get it, so I could have antibodies, but I'm cursed with an excellent immune system.  I only wore a bandana on my face when I was somewhere I would be seen by the powers that be, or if I knew I was on camera.  I had direct exposure at least 3 times, without a mask, and never got so much as the sniffles.  My wife is immunocompromised, and I have a toddler at home.  Neither one of them ever got sick either.  And we've lived our lives as normally as possible since the beginning.</p>

        <p>The WHO quietly released an article about this a week or so ago.. it states that as of the most recent studies, those who have recovered from Covid have at least as much immunity as those that have had the vaccine.   It angers me that this has been so widely ignored too. </p>

        <p>Thank you for this! I remember hearing whispers that natural immunity was a minimum of 6 months but could go as long as 8. And obviously variants would cause potential ‚Äúreinfection‚Äù but having the base B and T Cell memory would make thing quicker in terms of recovery/symptoms.</p>

        <p>Yeah, according to this it goes as long as 8 and probably even more. 8 months is the limit of the study so far. They mention at the end of the report that they will release new study findings in another 3 months.  I had to search for this, because literally NO major news source has made mention of it. It's so frustrating!</p>

        <p>Yes, but plenty of viruses can cause post-virus fatigue, so it isn't likely to be something unique, and tons of people claiming it never even had covid (had no antibodies after their "infection.")  So while it could be real, it could also be delusion.</p>

        <p>There's really not much medical literature to back this stuff up. Usually it's very vague and general symptoms like fatigue. Look up Chronic Lyme Disease, it's probably more of social contagion with psychosomatic symptoms.

        <p>A lot of these comments assume a defining feature of covid is loss of smell or taste. I'm old, and historically I've had lots of colds and flu over the years where you lose your sense of smell and taste. That's kind of a common feature of the flu. I remember complaining to my mom that food didn't taste right.</p>

        <p>I've had it twice and all I got was a skin disease so rare theres barely any research on it!!!!!!! I'm dealing with this shit for over a year NOW in numbers people taking the vaccine are getting the same skin problem?? If they so concerned about us why is no one bring this shit up!

        <p>That‚Äôs interesting. I knew kids get it and it‚Äôs usually gone in a few months. And that sometimes it was triggering Kawasaki type inflammation in them too. </p>
<p>I wonder if adults get it worse than kids (skin rash) and the only research is typically on children since they‚Äôre most prone to that rash as a child.</p>

        <p>In Germany they allow people recovered from COVID to have the same status as vaccinated people, but they only give you a few months from the time you were sick.  And of course this assumes you have documentation proving you recovered from COVID.</p>

        <p>If you mean spike protein production then it's not really the same thing plus your just assuming that the mrna vax will work exactly as it says on the packet.. I wonder if this industry has history of releasing faulty products to market and if they have protected them selves by removing all liability.. Hmmm</p>

        <p>wow wow wow</p>
<p>I do not assume the mRNA vaccines work like regular infections or Sinovac (a real vaccine). on the contrary.<br>
if you read my text above carefully you will notice that I outlined the absurd claims of the vaccine manufacturers that the vaccine is better than a real infection.  </p>
<p>recovering is a better protection!</p>
<p>the spike protein will only trigger a part of the immune system.<br>
a real vaccine or an infections is better.</p>
