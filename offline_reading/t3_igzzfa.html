    <strong>Rise in drug crime during coronavirus lockdown, figures show</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/uk-news/2020/08/26/rise-in-drug-crime-during-coronavirus-lockdown-figures-show/">https://www.expressandstar.com/news/uk-news/2020/08/26/rise-in-drug-crime-during-coronavirus-lockdown-figures-show/</a></p>
<p>“Drug crime rose by up to 44% during the coronavirus lockdown in England and Wales compared with the same period last year, official figures show.</p>
<p>According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), drug offences recorded by police rose by 22% in April to 16,570 and 44% in May to 20,687.</p>
<p>This is compared with 13,535 and 14,343 for the respective months in 2019.</p>
<p>The ONS report, published on Wednesday, put this down to “proactive police activity in pursuing these crimes during lockdown”.</p>
<p>It said the rises were driven largely by drugs possession offences, with “early indications” suggesting this was “particularly evident in London” where the Metropolitan Police had increased the number of drugs-related stop and searches it was carrying out during that time.”</p>

        <p>Well let’s see. A lot of hopelessness and job loss will sure make someone turn to drugs to escape it</p>

<p>Up to you to decide why drug offences may be on the rise, but I would strenuously argue it’s about a great deal more than pro-active policing. By every metric, UK citizens are struggling and suffering more now than at any other time in our history.</p>
