    <strong>Hospitals Overwhelmed partially due to Staffing Shortages</strong>
    <p><p>Just a personal anecdote here. One of my parents has worked the staffing office of a hospital/nursing home for about 25 years. They tell me all the time about how badly under staffed the nursing home and hospital is and how hard it is to get people hired. Even harder to get workers to to pick up extra shifts as overtime is not worth all the stress of the job. Workers are eager to leave immediately after their shift and refuse to stay when help is needed. Call outs are constant, and the ability for last minute coverage is gone since everyone hates coming to work. Many workers have completely changed profession to get away from the medical field all together because the stress is too high and pay too low. The hospital my parent works at doesn’t even deal with many Covid cases at all but they’re falling apart because of the lack of hands to help with all their patients dealing with their chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease, dementia, etc. </p>
<p>With vaccine mandates lurking around the corner in the medical field in the US I can see even more people leaving the field in droves, making it even harder to keep a fully staffed hospital and get care provided to the people who need it. This all proliferates and perpetuates overwhelmed medical facilities. What the mainstream narrative isn’t talking about is how many miserable workers left the industry and how many more don’t want to even care/want to be there right now. The facility in mind isn’t even overwhelmed with Covid cases. They never were, even though their main population is 80+ years of age. They’ve been pretty much Covid free for a couple of months as they’re no longer testing those who have had their vaccine….but everyone is utterly EXHAUSTED by the constant Covid protocol. All of these institutions are only destroying themselves.</p></p>

        <p>Yep. Hospital systems have been merging, cutting costs and stretching staff to the limit.</p>

        <p>Education had this same issue 20 years ago. Underpaid, overworked, four to six years of education needed to qualify (so, student debt in a low paying field).</p>
<p>There was a push to increase salaries across the board, healthcare and increased retirement benefits, lower teacher education requirements, and lower hiring standards, centralized curriculum control (hello New Math!)  It worked. </p>
<p>You no longer needed a four or six year degree in Education, any degree would work.  A 'teaching test' is what you needed to be certified, not student teaching, observations, hands-on training. Government funded Wage increases in public schools pulled faculty from colleges which were suddenly 'underpaid' compared to Public schools.  </p>
<p>It turned 'educated-Educators' in to higher paid babysitters relying on centralized and standardized curriculum. The 'great' teachers were left on the sidelines as the new wave of entitled 'teachers' took over and ingenuity, enthusiasm, disappeared.</p>
<p>Many people now see Educators as overpaid  and underqualified.</p>
<p>Give it a few years and the healthcare system will be wrecked as well.</p>

        <p>This is the plan. To make people sick with no medical help available.</p>
<p>Good luck to us all in the "New Normal".</p>

        <p>Let's also not forget, hospitals are government ran and have zero efficiency... They do not care if they get over ran, they'll wait for you to die in the lobby before they ever hustle</p>

        <p>Local hospital system is getting blasted by people reporting ER wait times of over 20 hours. They’re short staffed and are threatening mandatory vaccination. Many of the nurses are already looking elsewhere for employment that may get them away from direct patient care. The bad part is, I doubt the demand for vaccinated caretakers is coming from the patients. Instead, it’s coming from useless bureaucrats who don’t have a clue about the healthcare system.</p>
