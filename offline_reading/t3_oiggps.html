        <p>The Calgary Stampede is an annual event that has been held in our city for over 100 years. Daily pancake breakfasts are the norm, this particular one being held yesterday with our province's Premier, Jason Kenney, and Health Minister, Tyler Shandro. Some protesters in our City showed up to express their thoughts.</p>

        <p>Born and raised in Calgary, but haven't been back in 10 years. I can't believe Albertans are letting this happen, I've always been so proud to be Albertan. I'm having feels watching this. Never thought I'd miss those nasty burned-on-the-outside-raw-on-the-inside pancakes made by hung over cowboys</p>

        <p>The cities are awful, I don't think Edmonton has had more than 3 or 4 hundred out to their rallies, Calgary got up to a few thousand. People are just bending over with extremely high mask compliance. I would say there has been more rural and smaller town pushback. Hate to say it, but this province is unbelievably full of pussies. I think if people fall in line again when they bring restrictions and masks back this fall (I assume), then we are done for.</p>

        <p>I'm an Albertan and I'm ashamed of Jason Kenney. In a rare turn of events I share that disdain with the socialist/leftist minority in my province who have been saying he's Hitler 2.0 since his administration began.</p>
<p>While it's true Alberta has had one of the least restrictive lockdowns out of the several provinces, even 1 was too much. Kenney had a chance to become the Canadian DeSantis and instead tried pleasing everyone and ended up pleasing no one.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic he was on record saying he wasn't going to shut everything down because he "values the freedoms and liberties of Albertans." Months later while bringing in harsher measures, he criticized freedom protestors by publicly stating "now isn't the time for abstract political philosophies."</p>
<p>He's ensured his own party's destruction (It was a brand new party, an off-shoot of the 40+ years of mainline conservative party) in the next election, and quite possibly has secured the victory for the socialist-leaning new democrats (NDP). This NDP party was only ever in power for one term (before the current government), and they wracked up gigantic debts and made some bad calls.</p>

        <p>No one cares as long as they get their pancakes. Maybe the elite are right. We are mostly just cattle, content with some feed and entertainment.</p>
