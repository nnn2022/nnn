    <strong>The Netherlands going more and more down the drain</strong>
    <p><p>I havent been able to keep up with this sub much recently so most of my random ramblings may have been on here for ages. Forgive me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So... masks became compulsory in public buildings, everything shut down again, shops closed down, christmas could be celebrated with only 3 non-household members and NYE with only 2. Basically it's worse than the first lockdown in many many ways. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A few tricks I Learned: </p>
<p>Before this second lockdown i used to treat myself to a snack from mcdonalds once a week, but once they started demanding masks i decided to go to a local place where the staff wears their masks on their chin  and are just so over all this bullshit, and i walk in maskless and no one whines. The poor owner had just redone her whole cute little restaurant during the first lockdown and it looks so gorgeous but it's forced to be takeaway only. I doubt whether i will go back to the golden arches the way I've been treated there for going maskless. I kinda like my local place now cheaper and better quality stuff too. They now know me by name and order whereas the people at mcdonalds never even spoke to me, so yeah, my decision is made. </p>
<p>Same with grocery stores.  If i go into the big Jumbo or Albert Heijn here in the village they want me to wear a mask, but the smaller more local store is not only cheaper (though it doenst have the big brands like Ben&amp;jerrys  or CalvÃ© or Unox etc which is mildy sad but the ceaper ones are  decent enough as well as well as being... ya know... cheaper) but i also just walk in without a mask and while 80% of people there wear a mask as well as the staff no one has ever commented on me going maskless. Save for a few stares maybe. I just smile extra brightly like I have no clue why they are staring at me and move on with my grocery list.</p>
<p>Also I'm apparently "essential Personnel" at my current job so if they ask me why i'm on the street, which doesnt happen often but on occasion, i can just tell them to screw off basically. I pulled this trick with my friend once when a BOA asked my why we were traveling by public transport (which isnt forbidden but should only really be used by " essential personnel" and only for good reasons) and because we were sitting too close together. I just immediately claimed my friend an i were colleagues and were both essential and traveling home from work at the place i work at. Which wasnt true but that guy had no way of checking. And my friend was like "holy shit that worked..." </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All of which is nice. But...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Despite these workarounds life is still pretty shit and getting shitter. I hardly see my friends,  i cant remember the last time the girls and I went out for a good cocktail or drinks of any kind, apart from 3 of them i havent seen any of them for real since last march. I havent seen my extended family in months. I visted my grandparents maybe 6 times and havent seen my or aunts and uncles or cousins at all. My new years party fell through, and fireworks was basically banned, which is a huge tradition in my country like no other. Scouts had to stop again. My choirs 50 Year Jubilee was cancelled, and that can never come back so that is just heartbreaking. We moved it to next year but its not the same, it'll be 51 years by then. Scouts had to stop again and go online which is just not the point of scouting at all. Last year march I was in Egypt and my travel group decided then that even though we were being sent home way too early, we would meet each other again on the banks of the nile exactly one year later and finish the trip. But now my government is telling us not to travel until March so the agency wont let us travel. The national Scout Competitions were just cancelled again for 2021. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So yeah i see no improvement. Everyone is panicking due tot he UK version of the virus which is nonsense, just because more people get it doesnt mean it's that scary. Our cabinet just fell ( like the political one, not a wardrobe or sth) due to a massive massive scandal but they will probably be re-elected in march anyway due to the virus and because people are sheep and they've imprinted on their "leaders" and will follow them off a cliff now. It's all just symbolic and saving their own hides.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm behind the scenes somewhat and get a lot of information on actual cases of this virus and the number are definitely  way lower and the severity gets super overhyped. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I could rant on for pages and pages but I'm getting way too pissed off about this so called  "new Normal" so I'll call it a day. I just wanted to check in again after being absent for over 3 months.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you for this extensive description about life in the Netherlands. At the beginning of the plandemic it was a pretty cool country with one of the busiest airports in Europe, but I heard already it's going down rapidly. Stay strong and I hope one day all will get better. Greetings from Germany - our situation is equally bad here :/ Now they are talking about shutting down public transport and ordering everybody to work from home so that they economy finally crashes because unfortunately some companies are still alive by now</p>

        <p>I'm surprised Germany is going along with this! I haven't heard much about other countries or even states with in my own country.</p>

        <p>Minus the Nile, Unbox and other interesting names you mentioned, sounds like the U.S. only no one asks why we are outside, probably because there are so many homeless (I live in CaliforniaðŸ™„).</p>
