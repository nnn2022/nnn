    <strong>The vaccine debate and abortion are essentially the same moral dilemma</strong>
    <p><p>The crux of the pro-vaccine argument right now is: </p>
<p>&rt; "You young people need to take this risky, potentially life-destroying experimental drug for a virus that is no risk to you, in order to keep me safe and protect my generation's quality of life."</p>
<p>The vaccine and abortion issues are more similar than you realize.</p>
<p>The old are sacrificing the young. We live in a sick, diseased society where everything is upside down.</p></p>

        <p>my problem with this one is that many people are just saying it sarcastically to point out hypocrisy, but never actually accepted it themselves as justification for abortion in the first place. but it's true, my body my choice applies to both, bodily autonomy is the issue being debated for both.</p>
<p>the sanctity of bodily autonomy is the basis of many of my political and moral beliefs thus my view is consistent on both abortion and the vaccine. seeing people be inconsistent with their morals bothers me, like either anti vax choice / pro abortion choice, or pro vax choice / anti abortion choice. it shows they don't actually understand why they have those beliefs and have no actual convictions or integrity.</p>

        <p>But if you read OP, you can see that he is not inconsistent. Maybe you see that too in this case?</p>

        <p>Precisely. The reason I can be consistently pro-life yet also cry “my body my choice” in regards to vaccination, is because refusing a vaccine only results in the <em>potential</em> for <em>theoretical</em> and <em>unintended</em> harm to someone else, who likewise has autonomy over their own body in which they have the ability to take personal precautions against me/the virus. Unlike feticide, which deliberately and intentionally ends another life; one which also has the right to autonomy, and lacks the ability to defend or protect themself from my autonomous decision. </p>
<p>Pregnancy is a unique state of being. I don’t believe any other circumstance can really be related to it.</p>

        <p>No Boomer would stand for such a thing, and would never say a thing like that. If anything they've expressed their great dislike that everyone should shut their lives down on their account and 'they'll be fine".<br>

        <p>Not sure about that. I've been verbally assaulted multiple times just today by 60+ age people for "putting older people at risk" by not taking the vax.</p>
<p>It's fear. I get it. They've been told by the government that they will die if they catch COVID, so they will do anything for self-preservation, even if that means getting completely healthy young people to take a major health risk.</p>

        <p>Well you are telling the truth.</p>
<p>But every other age group with a Mask on has done exactly the same, and is well documented on many many videos about confrontations over the Mask.</p>
<p>It really depends who sees you first,  in my experience.</p>
<p>Put simple. No. Boomers don't want you to die.</p>

        <p>Go through with a pregnancy because it makes you feel better? Don’t forget we live in the western country with the highest maternal mortality rate. Other than death many permanent complications can arise during a seemingly low risk pregnancy and labor. </p>
<p>Sounds like you’ve got it backwards. You want o tell people what to do with their bodies despite potential risks. That’s between a patient and doctor and your feelings are totally irrelevant to anyone else’s life. Sounds like your logic is on the ‘let’s control other people’ side.</p>
