        <p>It is nice to know that there is someone else that has lived through the same things I have. What really gets to me is how I never believed it would be so simple for “them” to seize control and bring the country to it’s knees. I had way to much faith in the people of this country!</p>

        <p>Because patriots are good people. Even the founding fathers exhausted all legal means before resigning to suffer the hell that is war. 
The most concerning thing is the censorship directed by the White House. They swore to defend the constitution. Begs the question. Where are those patriots that believe in that oath? Why aren’t they defending the constitution from all enemies domestic?</p>

<p>This is why I believe this is the end, and there’s no victory for us- at least in the short term. If this is the end, the 7 year tribulation is <em>going</em> to happen, and you’d think an incredibly dangerous vaccine, fraudulent Covid tests, insane global medical segregation, countless doctors and families being silenced, the White House committing treason, Hunter Biden, the FBIs corruption, I could go on and on and on, but all this would’ve been enough for the patriots in our government to put a stop to this, yet they haven’t. </p>
<p>When are we going to realize that the Republican Party is also the enemy of the people? People in DC with far more access to intelligence than a bunch of us redditors should very well understand what’s going on globally, and I think they all do. How else would this continue? The plans for global government are there for literally every single politician to see and oppose, yet nothing is happening.</p>
<p>It’s quite literally the people versus the entire government at this point. We can only hope our local police will take our side.</p>

        <p>I was going to reply the same to the above post. As a young teenager a wise old man told me to “believe half of what you see, and none of what you read. “ I have never agreed blindly or completely with either party or any person.

        <p>I’m far from a Trump shill but hear me out, I’ve been thinking a lot about that and I’m just not sure if that’s the case. Here’s some reasons why it seems like he’s more than just controlled opposition:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The establishment staged a false flag terror attack mainly to get him removed from the internet (Jan 6)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He didn’t serve the interests of the NWO at all like recent republican presidents, except for Operation Warp speed which I just can’t see all the blame falling on Trump for. More like the people around him, then Trump being Trump tries to take all the credit for his amazing accomplishment </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media just didn’t treat him the same as other controlled opposition. They used cult tactics and psy op to make his name taboo, almost like he could NOTTTTTTT get re elected in order for this whole globalist plan to work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Election fraud. Still don’t fully know where I stand on this one, but from listening to Alex Jones (still haven’t confirmed for myself yet) sounds like there’s ample evidence in GA and AZ. If he was controlled opposition they wouldn’t cheat, they’d just let him win, let the left grow more resentful and violent and stir the pot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s a populist. I don’t think the NWO could’ve been rolled out if either Sanders or Trump became president, and they needed a totally compromised CCP agent in the White House for it to happen. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He just doesn’t serve the NWO’s interests. They were panicking and impeached him for shit half as bad as what Biden has openly admitted to. Think about if Trump threatened the country with F-15’s or nukes.... he’d be publicly hung for trying to become a dictator. The whole entire system was against him in a bizarre, overblown way</p>
</li>

        <p>He had Clinton's emails for two years and never released them. Had hunters since the start of the impeachment.</p>
<p>Trumpisms made rational people dismiss genuine things like the US supplying weapons to Syria. "Obama founded Isis."</p>
<p>His speeches were engineered  for maonstream sound bites.</p>
<p>List goes on but the emails say it all.</p>

        <p>Whatever it was, I am sure it had nothing to do with sacrificing children or drinking their blood, ala, adrenochrome, or Huma Abedin and Hillary wearing little kids faces like masks, people as upstanding as they are would never engage in such horrifying satanic rituals or anything...so yea, if you were thinking that happened, or was in the emails, just know it wasn't.  Neither was Obama and his ilk paying thousands of dollars for 'pizza' and other things.  That wasn't in there either.</p>
<p>In fact, it was mostly just cat videos.  Yea.  Cat videos.  Thats why they all got deleted.  Watched too many times, and someone accidentally hit delete when trying to forward to their friends.  Yep.  Thats totally it.</p>

        <p>He's a Jesuit, part of the Golden Dawn, poses as a Christian while his behavior suggests quite the opposite (whoring around, multiple marriages with "questionable" "women", holding a Bible upside down, saying that one should never have to ask G-d for forgiveness if one doesn't do anything bad..).</p>
<p>Do you wanna spend some time talking about his son-in-law ? The 666 Fifth Avenue-living, RFID chips-developing, false Middle-East peace-signing and overall just as disturbing as Obama.</p>
<p>If by now you don't get that Trump, the MAGA movement and Qanon are  major psyops, you will deserve everything that happens to you. And I'm not saying that in a "i hope you die" way, but good luck to you if you don't leave this cult.</p>

        <p>I think the real problem is that you actually believe(or have been peddled) the idea the Elohim 'unconditionally loves everyone'.  Yea, sure, in the sense that everyone is part of His creation, and He would like if everyone turned to and obeyed Him, but 'unconditionally loving' everyone?  There is so much wrong with that statement.</p>
<p>Do you love the car that leaves you stranded constantly?  Do you love the dog that bites you and ignores your commands?  Do you love the woman who cheats on you and ridicules you?  Is all that not 'conditional'?  With the whole world, for generations ad nauseum, pretty much giving Elohim the middle finger, why do you and other atheist/agnostic types expect Elohim to stop the atrocities that man perpetuates on himself?</p>
<p>Then there is the whole 'innocent people/children' argument, what did they do to deserve that?  That's like saying the wife that cheated on you, and you kicked out and cut off, had gotten pregnant by her lover, and now she is alone, and her child is born, and she is disenfranchised and treats the child like shit, but, according to this logic, you should have to not only step in and pay for said child, you should have to full on be a part of their life and love them like they were your own, not some bastard.  And since the father is a lowlife and doesn't care, you should 'unconditionally love' and care for that child, bc he is innocent.  And if you don't?  Well, people should say you are a shitty father who doesn't care.  That's the crock of responsibility that people try to pass off on Elohim.  Its absurd.</p>

        <p>That is true. If you repent and turn away from your sins you have to keep the commandments and stay away from sinning willfully. If you don't, after some time Yahuah will cut you off from His presence forever and there will be no afterlife.</p>
