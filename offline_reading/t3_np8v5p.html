    <strong>For the few of you that don't come here just for the memes...</strong>

<p>A 10y old, but excellent TED (actual TED, not TEDx-everything-goes garbage) talk from an epidemiologist, talking about bad science, bad data, bad arguments and some clever ways studies are skewed to show what whoever did them, wants to show.
It aged remarkably well, and it is very appropriate in the current climate (and by "current climate", I don't mean just COVID but also, well, akhem, actually climate, various *-isms, etc...)</p>
<p>It sounds technical and fancy, but it isn't, I promise. Its funny, and not too long. Its worth your time.</p>
<p>P.S. Sorry for misleading flair, I couldn't find a better suited one.</p>
<p>P.S.2. Pfizer's drug makes a cameo appearance around 11:20</p></p>
