    <strong>Respiratory Therapist here. Putting a paper together. Please ad input</strong>
    <p><p>In an attempt to gather the important facts regarding this circus, I have started a paper to help organize our debate...to help provide a coherent message to those that are trying to force this chemical in our bodies. Please feel free to add to this or give suggestions so I can revise. I plan to print this fucker at let it lay all over the hospital. I will likely get fired, but I will likely lose my job soon anyway, so...Anyway, here is what I have so far.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How Can This Be?</p>
<p>Masks? If the virus is airborne (cdc confirms this), then we know that surgical and cotton masks are of no use and are probably harmful. There are several current studies showing the harm they do to kids. Geographically, comparing masked states vs unmasked states, there is no meaningful difference and in fact, covid rates increased after mask mandates were put in place.</p>
<p>The government cares about saving lives? If they did, wouldn’t they make cigarettes illegal? Wouldn’t they reduce the speed limit to 45mph? Wouldn’t they advocate for healthy diets and lifestyles to prevent the hundreds of thousands of deaths each year from heart disease and diabetes? How much would that cost? Wouldn’t they recommend getting plenty of sunshine to increase our vitamin D levels if they wanted to help people fight covid? If the government is ok spending 6 trillion dollars to fight covid to save a million lives, wouldn’t spend the same amount to end world hunger? If they spent 6 trillion on world hunger, they’d save hundreds of millions/billions of lives. The math says they could end world hunger for 500 years with 6 trillion dollars. But yes, they care?</p>
<p>Vaccine? Force vaccinate an entire population for a disease with an absolute risk of death close to zero? The absolute risk of dying from covid in the USA is 0.01% and that is using the cdc data which is definitely inflated. Force vaccinate an entire population with a vaccine that is proving itself to be ineffective against new strains. A vaccine that definitely causes cardiomyopathy in young adults. A vaccine that has already caused at least 10,000 deaths per the VAERS reporting system. The injuries from the vaccine are already near 100,000. Force vaccinate an entire population with a vaccine that does not stop illness or transmission. Force vaccinate an entire population with a chemical with unknown side effects and without proper testing. Force vaccinate children who have a death rate of near zero. Force vaccinate people, saying that they must get the vaccine to protect those who cannot get it, but at the same time allowing no medical exemptions? A vaccine so effective it require a booster in less than a year? </p>
<p>12 of the 13 most vaccinated countries now have the highest rates of covid. </p>
<p>The head of the pathology department at the German University of Heidelberg, Peter Schirmacher, states that his department has performed autopsies on 40 individuals that died within 2 weeks of having received a Covid-vaccine. Schirmacher states that 30-40% of these deaths have been caused by the vaxx. He also states that he assumes the actual fatality rate of the vaxx could even be much higher. The autopsies are showing spike proteins in every organ of the body. The following is taken from an article in the Jerusalem Times regarding covid in Israel “Since the start of the coronavirus crisis, 6,452 Israelis have died of the disease. The deadliest month was January 2021, when 1,445 Israelis died. So far this month, 20 people have died of the virus, compared to nine people last month and 237 in July 2020. <strong><em>Fifteen of the 20 people who died this month were fully vaccinated.”</em></strong></p>
<p>PCR tests? The entire pandemic was driven by pcr testing. The pcr test was never designed to be a diagnostic tool. The inventor of the pcr test, Karry Mullis, had stated many times that the test can find literally anything if ran at a high enough cycle threshold. Studies have shown that when the test is ran at cycles greater than 18, you will get very high false positives. When ran at over 30, you will get an 80-90% inaccuracy rate. Karry Mullis invited Dr. Fauci to debate the topic, but Fauci declined. The CDC has revoked the emergency use authorization for the test due to it inaccuracy and has called it a class I recall, the most serious type of recall. The CDC has lowered the cycle threshold for testing vaccinated people to a threshold of no greater than 28. Why was it not reduced earlier if they knew this, which they admittedly did.</p>
<p>Has the virus been isolated? The answer lies in the difference between isolating a virus vs. sequencing it. They are not equal. Isolating shows the specific virus. Sequencing simply identifies unknown genetic material in a sample of genetic material. The virus behind COVID-19 was never isolated, all the proof is either very flimsy or downright false. Sequencing is how SARS-CoV-2 was born. A computer took some genetic material, found some unknown material in a sea of cross-contaminated genetic material, and created a computer model of the virus based on this unknown genetic material. Basing an entire pandemic on sequencing instead of isolation is shaky at best. This is how they find new "variants" as well. Anytime the computer returns a different sequence from its modeling, it's labeled a variant of the original sequenced virus. The problem is that genetic material, as stated above, is so cross-contaminated that it's easy for one computer model to differ from another. If the virus has never actually been isolated, doesn’t somebody have some explaining to do? Perhaps this is why the vaccines effectiveness if questionable?</p>
<p>Censorship? Science is never settled. It is a constant effort to prove itself and is never ending. Science is dependent on debate. Debate over covid is censored. When the pandemic started, the mainstream media stuck with the narrative that it was a wild virus. Anybody who tried to question that was censored, removed from social media platforms, attacked, called conspiracy nuts, and some even lost their jobs. The message from the media was “what does it matter? It’s here now and we have to deal with it” and the masses went along with this in a groupthink vacuum, all the while ignoring the importance of finding out where the most disruptive event in modern human history started. To think finding the origins of this pandemic is not important is incomprehensible, but that is what the masses did. Anybody who has a message different from that of the mainstream, is ridiculed, banned and censored.</p>
<p>Ivermectin? Remdesivir is currently the drug of choice to treat covid, even though there are no studies showing any efficacy. Remdesivir is a patented expensive medicine, costing nearly $500 per dose, whereas a complete course of Ivermectin has a cost of under $100. There are several studies showing Ivermectin is very effective at treating covid-19. Even the CDC’s own study showed a 13% decrease in disease mortality. Most studies show a 70-80% decrease in disease severity and hospitalization. Here is some verbiage from some studies found on trusted scientific publication websites….</p>
<p>” Meta-analyses based on 18 randomized controlled treatment trials of ivermectin in COVID-19 have found large, statistically significant reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral clearance. Furthermore, results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin. Finally, the many examples of ivermectin distribution campaigns leading to rapid population-wide decreases in morbidity and mortality indicate that an oral agent effective in all phases of COVID-19 has been identified</p>
<p>Therapeutic Advances: Meta-analysis of 15 trials found that ivermectin reduced risk of death compared with no ivermectin (average risk ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.19–0.73; n = 2438; I2 = 49%; moderate-certainty evidence). This result was confirmed in a trial sequential analysis using the same DerSimonian–Laird method that underpinned the unadjusted analysis. This was also robust against a trial sequential analysis using the Biggerstaff–Tweedie method. Low-certainty evidence found that ivermectin prophylaxis reduced COVID-19 infection by an average 86% (95% confidence interval 79%–91%). Secondary outcomes provided less certain evidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no benefit with ivermectin for “need for mechanical ventilation,” whereas effect estimates for “improvement” and “deterioration” clearly favored ivermectin use. Severe adverse events were rare among treatment trials and evidence of no difference was assessed as low certainty. Evidence on other secondary outcomes was very low certainty. Conclusions: Moderate-certainty evidence finds that large reductions in COVID-19 deaths are possible using ivermectin. Using ivermectin early in the clinical course may reduce numbers progressing to severe disease. The apparent safety and low cost suggest that ivermectin is likely to have a significant impact on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic globally"</p>
<p>” Findings Sixty-nine patients were enrolled (mean [SD] ages: ivermectin, 47.63 [22.20] years; control, 45.18 [23.11] years; P = 0.65). Eighteen patients (51.4%) in the ivermectin group and 18 (52.9%) in control group were male (P = 0.90). The mean durations of dyspnea were 2.6 (0.4) days in the ivermectin group and 3.8 (0.4) days in the control group (P = 0.048). Also, persistent cough lasted for 3.1 (0.4) days in the ivermectin group compared to 4.8 (0.4) days in control group (PP = 0.019). The mean durations of hospital stay were 7.1 (0.5) days versus 8.4 (0.6) days in the ivermectin and control groups, respectively (P = 0.016). Also, the frequency of lymphopenia decreased to 14.3% in the ivermectin group and did not change in the control group (P = 0.007). Implications: A single dose of ivermectin was well-tolerated in symptomatic patients with COVID-19, and important clinical features of COVID-19 were improved with ivermectin use, including dyspnea, cough, and lymphopenia. Further studies with larger sample sizes, different drug dosages, dosing intervals and durations, especially in different stages of the disease, may be useful in understanding the potential clinical benefits ivermectin.

        <p>Thanks this is good work. You might want to qualify that the cdc only removed the original RT pcr to replace it with other tests. However the recall does lead to questions relating to the original assays used which were all from different sequences and sources according to the fda. This is why the tests cannot be considered consistent.</p>
<p>If it isn't too much trouble can you post links to the mask studies on kids. That would be very useful in my school complaint ongoing.</p>

        <p>I'd appreciate if you could do that. Team effort here. Let's gather all we can under this one post and I will finish the paper. I only have so much time. If you could...</p>
<p>There are many studies out there regarding this. Many are out of germany I believe. Use duckduckgo and search for studies. There should be many</p>

        <p>Maybe a little, but nothing significant as far as the bacterial pneumonia. At least nothing remarkable at the moment. I could lie and say "yeah, tons of bacterial infx from the masks" but I am here to find the truth. I still know that masks are useless, at best, as I am a professional mask fit tester with thousands of dollars of equipment to play with. The virus is airborne, period. Surgical/cotton masks do not protect against airborne viruses, period. End of story as far as masks go. The story will continue with the negative effects as they come to light.</p>

        <p>Thanks man i really appreciate your response. Have you tested the co2 build up directly in front of the mask? I just have a little co2 tester but I'm getting readings of like 8,000 ppm when someone is wearing it. I think oshas limit is 5,000 ppm. Could this lead to hypoxia to increase cell death rate to increased rates of cancer? Other possible long term heath effects of breathing in this much co2? It would be awesome if you wanted to test this as I’m sure you have far more accurate equipment then lil ole me</p>

        <p>Great questions. I do not have those answers, but common sense says increasing co2 inhalation is not good. Decreasing o2 is not good. Increase resistance to flow is bad. Covering your humanity is dumb. Putting a mask on my kid is a crime and could be fatal if you try.</p>
