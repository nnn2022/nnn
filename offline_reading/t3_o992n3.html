    <strong>Serious question</strong>
    <p><p>If people have such an issue with the Spike Protein/ RNA from the vaccines; then do you have an issue with a virus that is covered in the very same spike protein and carries RNA that codes for it?</p></p>

        <p>The vaccine bypasses the defenses of your respiratory tract, and the vaccine products accumulate in organs that are only rarely exposed to the spike protein during an actual infection.
That's why the vaccine causes clots in the brain in people who wouldn't get them from the regular infection.</p>
<p>The main problem I have is that people are being fed misinformation and are being coerced by the MSM and their governments into getting an experimental biologic agent that has a higher risk of harm than the actual virus.</p>

        <p>So yes it does bypass mucosal immunity (initially some studies show that you do develop some level of mucosal immunity afterwards ), but your immune system does communicate with each other. Just because you get exposed in one part of the body doesn't mean another part has no clue what to do ( yay lymphatic and circulatory systems) The vast majority of the vaccine is taken up my professional APC (Antigen presenting cells )  and muscle tissue at the injection site.</p>

        <p>&rt;but your immune system does communicate with each other.</p>
<p>That's not the point.  The point is that the vaccine allows the spike to completely bypass a major immune barrier.  This allows the spike to immediately exert toxic effects on your internal organs before your immune system can even begin to mobilize.</p>
<p>&rt;The vast majority of the vaccine is taken up my professional APC (Antigen presenting cells ) and muscle tissue at the injection site.</p>
<p>Then how do you get spike protein in all major organs?  How do you get clotting and vascular endothelial damage in the brain?  How about myocaditis, menstrual changes, etc?
The adjuvants slow the elimination of the mRNA and the adenovirus shell slows elimination of the DNA in the vaccines.  That keeps the genetic material around long enough to distribute throughout the body.</p>
<p>If these were conventional vaccines, your statement would be correct, but it doesn't apply to the ones in question.</p>

        <p>Spike itself doesn't have toxic effects. With out it being attached to SARS CoV2 all it is a protein that our body can recognize as foreign/ non-self. Spikes sole job in covid infection is to bind to ACE 2, get cleaved by a surface protease, and cause the fusion of SARS CoV2 with the human cell with ACE 2. </p>
<p>The sort answer is you don't get spike in all major organs and even if you did you'd express it for a total of 24-48 hours at which point the mRNA is gone and your cells don't know how to make it anymore. </p>
<p>myocarditis is seen in a lot of infections/ immune responses it is still rare but not completely out of ordinary. I have yet to see any scientific proof of menstrual changes. </p>
<p>You have to remember a lot of these cases of people getting the vaccine and then developing something aren't directly from the vaccine. Most of these people would develop these things if the got the vaccine or not.</p>

        <p>Ye gods and little fishes, you are just full of bad info.  Educate yourself.  I'll get you started, but then I'm done.</p>
<p>&rt;Spike itself doesn't have toxic effects. With out it being attached to SARS CoV2</p>
<p>Wrong</p>
<p>https://scitechdaily.com/covid-19-is-a-vascular-disease-coronavirus-spike-protein-attacks-vascular-system-on-a-cellular-level/amp/</p>
<p>&rt;Spikes sole job in covid infection is to bind to ACE2</p>
<p>And when you bind a receptor, it activates that receptor.  This is the souce of blood clots and vascular damage.  What's more since the vax spike doesn't change form on binding, it can bind to multiple ACE2 receptors in succession.</p>
<p>&rt;The sort answer is you don't get spike in all major organs and even if you did you'd express it for a total of 24-48 hours at which point the mRNA is gone and your cells don't know how to make it anymore. </p>
<p>But there's no practical limit to how many spikes are made, and those spikes are much tougher than the mRNA.  Plus the mRNA can last longer than 48 hours within cells.  The blood tests don't detect that.  Only tissue biopsy will.</p>
<p>&rt;myocarditis is seen in a lot of infections/ immune responses</p>
<p>So, you admit it's possible with the vaccine.  That's a start.</p>
<p>&rt;You have to remember a lot of these cases of people getting the vaccine and then developing something aren't directly from the vaccine.</p>
<p>You mean the vaccine is incidental?  Like how about in 95% of deaths during this pandemic, Covid was incidental?  Glad you agree we need to change the Covid death count to follow the same rules as the vaccine deaths and deaths from literally every other respiratory infectious disease.</p>

        <p>I personally don't have an issue with the spike proteins, my issue is that the vaccine causes your white blood cells to destroy the cells that are hijacked to produce the spike proteins, and we have evidence to show that the vaccine does not just affect cells in the injection site but spreads systemically. I do not want a chemical compound that causes an autoimmune response to be coursing through my blood vessels to every part of my body. There are some tissues in your body that just do not regenerate if the cells are killed.</p>

        <p>So that's how our immune system works though when our cells get infected there is a whole class of Tcells that's job is to kill infected cells. The same thing you mentioned above would happen in COVID infection as well. We have pretty good data that shows a vast majority of the vaccine is picked up by professional Antigen presenting cells(APC) in which case the above pathway isn't used (MHC class 2 pathway for antigen presentation is used in this case). Next biggest class of cells in muscle tissue near the injection site. After that very little does get to the other tissues but nothing near the level of what the first two types of cells.</p>

        <p>The mRNA is transported by lipid nanoparticles, pretty much any cell can pick those up as the LNPs can cross phospholipid bilayers. I personally see no reason for myself to take the vaccine and accept those risks. You wouldn't tell a person who already had measles or chickenpox that they need to take a vaccine for those diseases before they can resume normal life. I just got over a head cold and had more symptoms from that than what my wife had for the two weeks she was stuck in the house with me after testing positive for COVID.</p>

        <p>Yes and those LNPS are easily taken up by APC not very easily taken up my normal cells. non APC don't just take up any lipid they find floating around.   </p>
<p>You would ask them to get a booster potentially thought, I  know that's the case for chickenpox unsure of measles, since it's very uncommon now with a vaccine</p>

        <p>Yes. I have an issue with it....</p>
<p>It was really shitty of China and elements of the u.s. government and every media major media company in the world for creating it / releasing it and downplaying it when it could have been contained. The charges for people involved should be no less than treason.</p>
<p>I was very afraid of it during and BEFORE the two weeks to flatten the curve.</p>
<p>I think the public could benefit from ivermectin being widely available for people who contract this very real illness.</p>
<p>However, now that it is endemic, we should no longer try to contain it by destroying the global economy, especially now that we know that younger populations have a very low risk, and an experimental gene therapy is available for those dumb enough to take it.</p>
<p>Any other questions?</p>

        <p>RNA carries information to genes and can literally turn them on and off. A quick look at the background of modeRNA will tell you that they specialized in gene therapy.</p>
<p>A quick Google search for RNA genetic therapies will give you tonnes of peer reviewed studies and articles on the subject.</p>
<p>Just make sure to start your search with "before:2020" - before the gaslighting began. 🙂</p>

        <p>&rt; In vitro–transcribed mRNA (IVT mRNA) is emerging as a new class of drug that has the potential to play a role in gene therapy that once was envisioned for DNA. Although first described as a therapeutic in 1992, IVT mRNA's immunogenicity prevented its development for protein replacement therapies.</p>
<p>&rt;Messenger RNA (mRNA) plays a vital role in translating the instructions in DNA into the proteins of life. </p>
<p>Hey, here's a great article from Harvard university about the role of RNA in GENE THERAPY!</p>
<p>https://hsci.harvard.edu/translation/what-are-drugs-4-gene-therapies</p>
<p>I'm not against gene therapy. I'm really not. With more research, who knows, we may be able to cure a bunch of diseases, maybe even cancer.</p>
<p>However, I don't want it forced on anybody. Not that much to ask....</p>

Been taking it for 3 months now, and it eliminated the fatique and chronic brain fog I was having.</p>

        <p>Honesty just curious I hear a lot of chat from camps saying it’s been isolated, purified, and demonstrated to be transmissible and others championing the ideas that nothing new exists, and people saying it’s an engineered bio weapon. I with a college roommate how works as a wildlife biologist who says it’s new and very real and has gone through the isolate, purify, demonstrate process like any new virus regularly does.</p>

<p>That is one of the isolates. Once this started transmitting and we didn't know what it was the first step was the sequence it to see what we were dealing with.</p>
<p>We know its a coronavirus (class of virus) and that it is similar enough to SARS 1 that we named it SARS CoV2. As of know we do not have a very good origin virus to compare it to in other animals. ( we have some pretty close matches but we are still missing a couple links to what we have now)</p>
