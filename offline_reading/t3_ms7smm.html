    <strong>Sucharit Bhakdi Predicted Clotting</strong>
    <p><p>I had been on the fence. About letting my family members do what they wish regarding the vaccine.</p>
<p>Then I discovered that this microbiologist/MD had predicted what we are currently seeing with the MRNA vaccines. Along with other colleagues and professionals in the field.</p>
<p><a href="https://doctors4covidethics.medium.com/urgent-open-letter-from-doctors-and-scientists-to-the-european-medicines-agency-regarding-covid-19-f6e17c311595">https://doctors4covidethics.medium.com/urgent-open-letter-from-doctors-and-scientists-to-the-european-medicines-agency-regarding-covid-19-f6e17c311595</a></p>
<p>They sent a letter.</p>
<p>And it was ignored.</p>
<p>They were all correct. And listening to the mechanism by which the vaccines work (and thus endanger the lining of our endothelial cells), I just can't see how anyone would recommend this vaccine to ANYONE but -possibly- the most absolute at risk patients. And even then, the vaccine may be worse than COVID-19 itself.</p>

<p>An up-to-date discussion with Mr. Bhadki.</p>

<p>How could anyone not fear MRNA, gene-based vaccines after knowing this?</p>
<p>I do not see how anyone could recommend getting the vaccine. Short-term risk AND long-term risk of heart attack and stroke due to damage to the endothelial cell layer.</p></p>

<p>Because they DON'T know this. The media tells them every day that the vaccine is safe and sucharit bhakdi is heavily "fact-checked" and a conspiracy theorist who doesn't know what he is saying.</p>

        <p>Excellent Post. In my country, Ireland, despite having earlier suspended AstraZeneca, they were still injecting it into people with special needs a week ago.</p>
<p>I hope, like you, that after so many months of lies more people will wake up to the dangers of these substances and refuse them. </p>
<p>The European Medicines Agency, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/512844-eu-approval-pressure-pfizer-covid-vaccine/">according to leaked emails</a>, was put under a huge amount of pressure by the European Commission to approve the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA drugs.</p>
<p>Mike Yeadon (former Pfizer VP) <a href="https://delingpole.podbean.com/e/dr-mike-yeadon-1617215402/">believes these mRNA injections are likely to cause thrombosis too</a>.</p>
