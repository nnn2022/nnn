    <p><p>If the flu was managed in the same way that CV was this year, without the flu vaccine (edit: I would reckon this even with a flu vaccine), the discrepancy between the CV and Flu IFRs would vanish. Remember, CV is a highly politicized,  and sensationalized virus in ways a disease was never before (HIV doesnt even come close), giving TOO many incentives to bake the numbers in every way possible. Also consider that people were getting tested if they had a reason to be tested such as having severe symptoms or being treated in ER. We had no way of counting the common colds and the asymptomatic, while in other countries the virus was more widespread among the vulnerable.</p>
<p>Now with the "rising" cases (just more testing), the IFR would reflect a lower number, based on better data and more reflective of reality.</p></p>

        <p>Funny how history proved right, Covid-19 IS just like the flu! Especially given the length of time, it seems to start looking more and more like the common flu.</p>
