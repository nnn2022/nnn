    <strong>The origins of covid</strong>
    <p><p>Are we allowed to talk about the origins of covid in this sub?</p>
<p>In the /r/LockdownSkepticism this link was posted,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/china-covid-lockdown-propaganda">https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/china-covid-lockdown-propaganda</a></p>
<p>“China’s Global Lockdown Propaganda Campaign”</p>
<p>So I replied there to a poster in this thread, but my post was deemed inappropriate, and a suggestion was made that I should try it in another sub.</p>
<p>So here’s the post that was deemed inappropriate,</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>(quote from another poster)</p>
<p>\&rt; I don't think this virus was made in a lab or released intentionally but I DO believe China is using the crises to its full advantage.</p>
<p>(my reply)</p>
<p>And I also think this virus wasn’t made in a lab. It was made in a think-tank, or perhaps better in a stink-tank.</p>
<p>But in any case, if the virus really wasn’t made in a lab, what do you say about Mr Bill Gates and associates rehearsing the whole thing back in October 2019? The Event 201, you remember?</p>
<p>His illustrious associates were of course the World Economic Forum, and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p>
<p>Were all these folks psychics, I want to know. A bunch of Edgar Cayces? Or maybe they were fooled by those sneaky Chinese bots ahead of time somehow.</p>
<p>------------ (end of post)</p>
<p>So what do folks think?</p></p>

        <p>So what was my error, where did I go too far in my skepticism? Any guesses?</p>
<p>After all, I didn’t really say anything that hasn’t been said before a thousand times on the Net.</p>
<p>Was the subversive thing to say that the virus was NOT made in a lab? I guess we’re now all supposed to embrace the conspiracy theory about the lab. Really... :-|</p>
<p>So it’s not so easy to put your finger on where did I go wrong.</p>
