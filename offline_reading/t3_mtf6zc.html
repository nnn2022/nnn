    <strong>Making a Reputation</strong>
    <p><p>I have been off social media since the beginning of January simply because I was tired the constant censorship. I joined reddit a couple weeks ago so I could openly discuss topics with others open mindedly, and it seems things got worse since. Appprently according to other Canadians the Charter of Rights  don't matter unless you are being affected directly. On Friday Ontario's Premiere attempted to the allow police to use arbitrary powers to arrest and fine anyone who left their homes either on foot or in personal vehicles. The entire province erupted into a civil rights argument following by the police refusing to enforce the new "authority" given to them. Everyone was happy, and the orders were reversed by the government. As soon as it was over yeasterday everyone was back to hating on protesters and saying they have no civil rights while blaming them for being disease spreaders. When discussed in other threads calling out the hypocrisy, I get banned from speaking about it and posting links to the related laws that protect Canadians rights. This is a crazy world we live in. What ever happened to freedom of speech for expressing a different opinion, and most importantly telling the truth?</p></p>

        <p>Another petition has started also.
It’s convenient for OHA that they “get too many emails” and will not respond to complaints. Then they redirect you to some “here’s how to get shots web page”</p>
