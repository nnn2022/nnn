    <strong>The vaccine is technically not a prophylactic or therapeutic. It can be considered a secondary prophylactic. Not a primary prophylactic. It really should be labeled as a pre-treatment for symptoms.</strong>
    <p><p>The COVID vaccine does not stop you from getting the virus. It doesn't stop you from spreading the virus. The only thing they have been able to some what prove is it might make symptoms less severe. You can not take the vaccine as a therapeutic. If we take what the caring and loving Dr from Alabama says to her patients. "It's too late for you to get the vaccine". So with that said. What other secondary prophylactics can we use that may work just as well as the vaccine. </p>
<p>How about exercising, getting sun, taking vitamins and eating healthy. If you were offered to do this instead of taking the vaccine it will probably work just as well. Maintaining a healthy life style doesn't stop the spread of the virus nor will it help you if try to start this if your showing symptoms of the virus. So it's not a cure or a therapeutic if started while already sick. But it will still provide the same type of protection the vaccine provides. </p>
<p>Wearing a mask and social distancing. Doing this weakens your immune system. Your immune system needs exercise as well. When you wear a mask and social distance your immune system is not getting the everyday normal exposure to viruses and bacteria. Which makes your immune response less reactive when it finally encounters these things. You are setting yourself up to get sicker from everyday viruses and bacteria which will put your immune system in a weaken state. So if you catch COVID it may make it worse for you. </p>
<p>Ivermectim and hydroxychloroquine is actually a secondary prophylactic and can be used as a therapeutic if caught early enough. These medicines have been available for years. They are extremely safe. They are cheap and can be mass produced. Seems like a better choice. </p>
<p>So why are they making a secondary prophylactic a mandatory pre-treatment? That barely has any benefits and a bunch of questionable short term side effects and unknown long term side effects. Why did they give emergency use for this pre-treatment and not recommend exercising, eating healthy, strengthening your immune system, taking vitamins, and known anti-virual prophylactics and therapeutics.</p></p>

        <p>Why? you ask. There is a fuck tonne more money to be made from ‘pre treating’ 99% of the population than there is from treating the less than one percent that are actually going to die. Plus side effects from the shitty gene therapy shot is bonus cash $$$ oh and don’t forget boosters too. Makes you wonder if they intentionally designed it to be the worst vaccine ever.</p>

        <p>Yes. Using the pandemic and the crooked pharmaceutical companies to launder trillions of tax payers dollars from covid relief to line everyone's pockets before they crash the economy and implement digital currency. While they shutdown your small business and when the rent and mortgage program stops. They are going to turnaround and buy your business and homes for pennies on the dollar. The fed is also pumping that worthless fiat into the stockmarket to keep it afloat to to hide all the super rich selling their stocks at premium prices. We will be left holding the bags and we will be blamed for the collapse.</p>

        <p>Therapy to me seems like a term used for treating after or during. Not before or preventing.</p>

        <p>It's kinda worrying that the constant fear propaganda is turning a lot of our own people to not only hate their fellow countrymen. But to wish death on them. Not only with covid. But anyone who is not 100% in line with their whole ideology. Strange times.</p>
