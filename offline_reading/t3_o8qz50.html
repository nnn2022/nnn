        <p>-- Emerged from an area across the street from a lab that works on gain-of-function Coronaviruses. </p>
<p>-- This lab has a history of leaks and bad protocol.</p>
<p>-- Three scientists from this lab went to the hospital in November 2019 and one spouse died.</p>
<p>-- The bats in question aren't even in Wuhan, they're hundreds of miles away. 
-- During a time when the bats were in hibernation</p>
<p>-- Virus coincidentally is human adapted, something previously known as impossible by evolutionary scientists</p>
<p>-- Happened naturally and not from a lab. ðŸ˜‚</p>

        <p>You do know that they have documented now that this virus was going around 4 years ago, right?</p>
<p>JHH in Baltimore just released a paper with evidence of that not a week ago.</p>
<p>Time to admit the truth: This virus didn't come from the Wuhan lab, it is a natural virus, it is from bats in some way.</p>
<p>I'm skeptical of it being from the wet markets however. The anti-carnivores ALWAYS like to blame the wet markets whenever there is a disease outbreak but every single time? It turns out that the wet markets are blameless.</p>
