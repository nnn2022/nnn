    <strong>I took my life for granted</strong>
    <p><p>I got home from college today and when my dad and brother came to pick me up they were wearing masks.  They wore masks the entire car ride home.  My mom wears a mask inside the house and in between bites of food at the dinner table.  She’s constantly on her phone looking at covid updates and is terrified of the virus.  What the fuck happened to my family from august to December?</p></p>

        <p>Four words, my friend: Trauma-based mind control.</p>
<p>Expose people to traumatic stimuli for long enough and consistently enough, they'll be ridiculously suggestible to whatever the fuck you want them to do, particularly if it's constantly reinforced. See, the mainstream narrative about the 'rona.</p>

        <p>Thanks, friend.</p>
<p>I appreciate it, but just judging from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ij6yu9/experiences_in_the_clownvid19_dystopia_or_a/">what I've seen</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jmdbaa/how_to_persuade_a_loved_one_to_see_that_the_rona/">already</a>, I kind of doubt she will.

        <p>Same thing happened to a friend of mine as well. He used to be by far the most freedom-loving American I knew and that was part of what made us such good friends. Then the rona kicked off and he constantly read about how “bad” covid is getting, and talked about it non-stop every day. Last time I talked to him he was going on about how people who don’t wear masks should be rounded up and shot, and how people are incredibly selfish for wanting a freedom as basic as being able to go outside. Complete polar opposite of who he used to be. </p>
<p>The weirdest thing to me is he seemed like the absolute last person I’d expect to fall for the corona meme like that. It’s like he went from having free and independent thought to complete and total compliance to the government (which he, as well as I, have always had a serious distrust for)</p>

        <p>Yeah, I had to make sure I wasn’t in some bizarre dream or some shit after that. It’s like something took over and he just isn’t himself at all anymore. Sorry to hear about your family though man, I couldn’t imagine that happening to mine. Propaganda and fearmongering is a helluva drug apparently.</p>
<p>On a separate note, I have always found it incredibly ironic that the crazy pro-maskers say they wear it because they “care about those around them” and want to “save lives”, but then instantly turn around and say people need to die because of a cloth (or lack thereof)</p>

<p>You don't know the half of it.
There's a real possibility that I may have to cut out my mom and brother for the most part, for my own safety since they believe everything the MSM/Reddit hivemind feeds them and are fully onboard with the new abnormal, no matter how totalitarian it gets.</p>

        <p>My heart goes out to you both, it's unforgivable what these people and their fearmongering has done to good folk, sometimes our closest family members.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of that could potentially snap someone like that out of it is some sort of profound spiritual experience, whether attained by personal meditation, the use of psychoactive compounds, or both in tandem. When people seek out or accidentally stumble upon the divine fire within every one of us, it can completely about-face entire personality paradigms (sometimes, truthfully, not always for the best). </p>
<p>This is based solely on personal anecdote, and I respect everyones' perspective and opinion on subjective matters such as these, so take of it what you will.</p>

        <p>I guess the narrative in the UK is more ‘you will be fine but you could kill an old person’ I think they realise 90% are wise to the fact it isn’t a danger to them so they go with the guilt angle...</p>
<p>At least there don’t seem to be any great numbers of young and middle aged people who genuinely believe they will be really ill/die. </p>

        <p>My mom is the same way. She's very close to canceling our Christmas because she is so terrified of her own children coming into the house and potentially getting her sick. At the bare minimum she will require all of us to wear masks in the house and she will sit in the room next to the living room as we eat and exchange gifts. My dad told me she is glued to the television and rarely ever leaves the house. She still opens mail with latex gloves on. Its insane for me to hear about it</p>

<p>Does she still sanitize all the packages and groceries coming into the house or insist upon so doing too? If so, she could very well be my mom's sister from another mister.</p>

        <p>Don’t know his mother, but this is absolutely a thing. In the county where I live we are under a mask ordinance that requires masks be kept on at all times inside restaurants except when actively taking a bite or sip of food. And they enforce the hell out of it, too. Needless to say I have stopped going out to eat. Not that it matters, actually. We just got news that in a  few days time we will be going to a new lockdown that bans all in person dining. Also, we are going shelter in place just in time for Christmas. I love how they announce these things days ahead of time. It’s such a dire emergency we have no choice to go the strictest lockdown possible, but we can afford to wait a few days (just until Christmas Eve, my, what a coincidence that Rona willing to hold off til then — too bad they couldn’t negotiate a deal where Rona waited until the day after Christmas or something). They announced these new measures last Friday, but they could somehow afford to wait a whole entire week. You can be arrested and face hefty fines and up to 1-year of jail time if you don’t abide by them. And they’ve been arresting and charging people already for getting caught sans mask in public...the local government actually releases regular updates along the lines of “27 people arrested and cited today for being caught in public violating the mask order” and so on. They are absolutely gleeful over the amount of arrests they’ve been making — it’s the only number they love more than announcing the daily total of new cases. </p>
<p>Only 2 places we are not required to mask up are in our private homes (although I’m sure that’s coming) and in government-owned buildings. Not sure what the justification is for the mayor’s office and the health department (among others) being exempted from any and all mask regulations but, hey, that’s apparently an important part of the overall safety plan so who am I to wonder? You’d think the local health department and the the mayor and his stuff would be top of the food chain when it comes to being offered and assured the highest of protections. So the fact that they’re willing to allow people to move about those facilities unmasked and exposing our highly important overloads to a possible run in with Covid...I give up.</p>

        <p>Man, no shit. My pre-doomer parents were like completely different people. Now they want Christmas on fucking Zoom. </p>
<p>I have never been a social person. I don't really have any friends. But at least I went to movies, went down to the bar on a Friday, walked around and went out to eat once in a while, hung out at the library. I always thought I was pathetic for how little I actually got out and did stuff. </p>
<p>Now my old life feels vibrant, exciting, and fast-paced by comparison...and I <em>hate</em> the people who took it from me. Just a fucking white hot ball of rancid, rotting rage in the bottom of my chest. I will never forgive and never forget, never fucking ever. 50 years from now I will remember what they took from me.</p>

<p>I showed this to someone on reddit and because it concluded that masks might help by as little as 0.3% rendering them ineffective, they decided to draw the conclusion that they work from something statistically insignificant. Too many people are statistically illiterate.</p>

        <p>You could lean towards masks and say that they would only save like 100-300k in the long run and that’s not worth ruining socioeconomics (or life/economy) (that could be math/calculus based probability) and you could also solve for the low-end based on current data.

        <p>Damn that’s sad. I’m really sorry. Just hope things happen in the next year or two that shines a light on the ways we’ve been manipulated in such a way where even the most traumatized and caught up in it will have to see it too. </p>
<p>Your post made me sad thinking about her. Living in fear is no way to live.</p>
<p>Keep givin her love and try to do something relaxed w her. May sound stupid but learn knitting together. I don’t even know how but for some reason I’m thinking this. She needs something to just calm her mind and you can be a calming presence to guide her in a way. If knitting sounds dumb maybe something else? </p>

        <p>I'm so sorry for you man.
Fortunately my mom still wants to have christmas and she doesn't wear a mask when she's around us.</p>
<p>And she starts to have a few questions. Just yesterday she asked: do you think they count the people who have flu as corona? It's just weird that there's no more flu. </p>
<p>So I still have some hope, albeit not a lot.
My family only does the virtue signalling but indoors they just have friends over, hug others, and my mom and dad even went on vacation. Outside they are scared of the virus though.</p>

        <p>My father, one of the smartest people I know, who works in the medical field wears a mask while driving even with the same family he lives with. I asked him why and he just looked depressed and just kind of ignored it. Hell, they even threatened to kick me out and not see them if I don't take that vaccine. </p>
<p>I should also add, CNN or any MSM blasts in any room of the house. Both repeat what's told to them, try challenging that opinion would cause them to get hysterical. This proved alone even the smartest people can be fooled into believing anything when you adapt to their habits  (wake up, tv, internet).</p>

        <p>I feel ya. My aunt is a typical example of this. She has brain tumor signs but is afraid to go to the hospital. She shakes from fear every time she needs to go shopping. She's in a constant state of panic. Yeah she is one of the people who'd probably tell you to wear a mask but I know it's a fear response, she's terrified. I've tried to get to her on various occasions but she is too afraid. I'm beyond pissed about this fear terrorism. You can't turn anywhere anymore without being bombarded. And unfortunately...it works on a large amount of people.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that your family feels the need to behave this way. It's hard to argue with frightened people, cause fear isn't always rational, as we've seen this year. Just remember that this isn't their fault. The fear mongering from politicians and the media has been intense. In some countries there have even been leaked documents confirming this, cause otherwise people won't comply. It's sickening to read about it. </p>
<p>Have you tried printing out facts and statistics to convince your family in a respectful manner that they don't need to worry unless they're already very sick and/or obese?</p>

        <p>Not just governments and people in power but damn internet and social media. This never could have happened 30 years ago. We didn’t have the infrastructure to stay home forever.  But thanks to the “wonders of technology “ and high speed internet we can get everything we “need” with a phone or a computer. Ffs. I should have been burning 30 years earlier. Fuck this internet and tech allowing the bitchs in power to pull this.</p>

        <p>Does she wash her hands before and after touching the mask? Does she wear it for no longer than 6 hours and then dispose of it in a safe manner? </p>
<p>If she's not doing these things there's no point in wearing one, it is doing more harm than good.</p>
