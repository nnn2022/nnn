    <strong>Wake up United Kingdom.</strong>
    <p><p>It's only a bad cold or flu,</p>
<p>It's only a mask, two metres, floor marking, one way system, temporary protective screen, and until we flatten the curve, </p>
<p>It's only to protect the NHS and save lives, non-essential workers are not important right now,</p>
<p>It's only applying to churches, bars, restaurants, gyms, salons, care homes, schools, weddings, funerals, gatherings, travelling,</p>
<p><strong>Ok, it's going to be three more months of lockdown, and young people are solely to blame.</strong> </p>
<p>It's only an app for tracing those who might be at risk and to protect others you might have been in contact with because you didn't follow the rules,</p>
<p>It's only a couple of times a week to make sure children are not infected and so they don't kill their Grandparents, </p>
<p>It's only for fact checking nothing to do with censorship and it's only necessary because of you spreading misinformation,</p>
<p>It's only a short circuit breaker to prevent the need for another lockdown,</p>
<p><strong>Ok, you can do what you want at Christmas but it will be your fault that we need another lockdown.</strong></p>
<p>It's only another lockdown until the cases go back down which you caused by celebrating Christmas,</p>
<p>It's only until we meet the requirements of the roadmap which will end in June and I am graciously referring to it as Freedom Day,</p>
<p>It's only until we get a vaccine and vaccinate those who are vulnerable,</p>
<p>It's only until we vaccinate people over 50 and adults at risk, </p>
<p><strong>Ok, it's going to be four more weeks. Because young people are not having vaccines fast enough so go "grab a jab" and stop being selfish.</strong></p>
<p>It's only until we vaccinate everyone over 18,</p>
<p>It's only an app for travelling abroad, or to go to any sporting event or concert, </p>
<p>It's only scientific fact provided by experts,</p>
<p>It's only mandatory for certain people,</p>
<p><strong>Ok, we are going to lift the restrictions, but only for those who remain vaccinated, and some restrictions will remain in place for everyone with no exceptions.</strong></p>
<p>It's only until we vaccinate all adults,</p>
<p>It's only until we complete trials on vaccinating children, </p>
<p>It's only until we have vaccinated children so they can go back to school,</p>
<p>It's only until we give everyone a third dose to protect them this winter,</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's only the law, and by now it's too late.</p></p>
