    <strong>Are the Doomers actually afraid, or do they just not want to go back to work/work at home forever?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m not saying every unemployed person is a Doomer. I’ve just seen a lot of them admitting that they don’t want the pandemic to end because they don’t want to go back to their jobs, have to socialize with others in person, shake hands, etc. I’ve also seen the ones who work from home bragging about how they spend their whole work day drinking or smoking pot. </p>
<p>I can’t say I blame them too much, they’re making an extra $300 a week being unemployed. I’d probably be making more on UI if I weren’t working with that extra $300. I’d also go insane if I had to sit inside doing nothing and not seeing other people for over a year though. It seems like the UI keeps getting extended as well. Although it’ll suck for them when the UI runs out and they’re all applying for the same jobs and get one.</p></p>

        <p>They’re brainwashed by mainstream media. What Russians call useful idiots. Some of them like being able to wear sweatpants at work for those who work at home. And with fast food delivery they don’t have to leave the house for food. Even the more wholesome “meal delivery” service just makes it easier. With celebrity endorsements those services just sell themselves. Meanwhile the celebrities eat higher quality versions of the food they advertise </p>
<p>They can order everything online and that makes Amazon richer. </p>
<p>Some of them don’t care about seeing people because sometimes they were shut ins before who thought going to work was enough past the comfort zone. But not everyone finds fulfillment in watching Netflix at night. Some people actually want to have gone out and experience life and have real adventures. The adventure outside is always more than the greatest television series or video game. Who’s to say that there’s not a way to literally go to another dimension where you can use magic or have super powers? If people just sit around all day at home they will never find out if they can. That’s a wild point yes however it does speak to the possibility of what you are able to find by being out in the world and experiencing life. </p>
<p>Some of them also use this to feel accomplished or to shame others.</p>

        <p>All these people( i know a few) are failing to realise that all these free money is going to stop at some moment. Only then they will feel de full force of this so called pandemic.
 No one around me grasps the term “inflation”
 Back in ‘89 when my country was “saved” from comunism we got this bitter reality.</p>
<p>The same ammount that bought my parents a 3 bed flat, 3 years later would be the price of a VCR . 
 People have no fucking understanding of anything these days and that is going to hit like a bus.</p>

        <p>My gf isn't skeptical like me but she doesn't seem particularly afraid, she just doesn't want to go back into the office.  Her coworkers however seem legit afraid but I wonder if there is a subliminal aversion to going back into the office that's the driving factor.</p>

        <p>They do not want to go back to work. I've been working from home for a bit and I can definitely see the appeal (no commuting, working in your PJs, getting more done around the house, etc) but I cannot imagine anyone doing this forever. We will all end up looking and acting like the people in Wall-e with so much lack of activity.</p>
