    <strong>Example Number 27,339 of covid insanity</strong>
    <p><p>Always browsed but decided to add my own example. </p>
<p>I was raised to always question things and have thought this was insane from the beginning. I’ve never really talked to people about it except family, and even that is getting hard. </p>
<p>I never really thought I’d see the covidiot logic much because I’m a loner and don’t talk to people but this just makes me want to bang my head against a wall. </p>
<p>If anyone is unfamiliar Grindr is a gay hookup app used mainly to have hookups with strangers. Of course lots of people love flaunting their vaccine status.</p>
<p>They are worried about catching a cold. While having bareback sex with strangers. And gay men on average have many, many, sexual partners. Not to debate morality it’s just a statement. </p>
<p>I can’t believe that logic. </p>
<p>And I don’t care what gay men say, I am one myself, just assume that those who say they practice safe sex most of the time don’t. They say that to look good.</p></p>

        <p>It also doesn't make sense to allow illegal immigrants in to the country with No Covid vaccination or testing required for entry.</p>
<p>The same as people smoking and screeching about health and thinking of others.</p>
<p>As soon as you apply ANY logic to the Covidiotd mantra the mantra falls apart.</p>
