    <strong>NNN posts quietly deleted off Fauxbook</strong>
    <p><p>Today I was debating someone about the failed mRNA animal trials on Facebook. Side note- I've virtually been off of FB for over a year now, but keep it for messenger and just to keep in touch with friends without scrolling or posting, but I just had the urge to look today to see what the normies were saying.</p>
<p>The woman asked for references for what happened in the animal trials, and I provided her 4 links, the last one which was a link to a thread here. The post went up, no warnings or anything else. I went back about an hour later and my response was gone. I replied again, same links, same thing.. Came back and response was gone.</p>
<p>Then I decided to remove the link to this subreddit.. Funny enough, it's still up. I remember in the past, you'd either get a message when you post something saying certain websites were not allowed, or you would later have it removed with a message sent to you or a misinformation warning plastered on the information you provide.</p>
<p>Now they've taken it another step.. They remove it with no warning with the hopes that you just don't notice. The censorship goes under the radar, no one gets the information your providing, while most people don't even notice they are being censored. </p>
<p>The tactics are getting more extreme and ridiculous. It definitely makes it apparent that, even if I'm pulled to on the rare occasion, I will not be sharing information like this on Facebook. It's kinda sad, because that means they get exactly what they want.</p></p>
