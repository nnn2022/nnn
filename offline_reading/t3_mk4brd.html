    <strong>PLANDEMIC and other conspiracies</strong>
    <p><p>2010, The Rockefeller Foundation releases a document titled "OPERATION LOCKSTEP," which is a fictional outline of the way a virus can be used to establish authoritarian rule. History has shown us that oftentimes guilty people and psychopaths will write fictional stories, novels, and books in order to plan for something in the future, or to document something previously having happened without getting in trouble. Serial Killers write about their ventures in a fictional way, oftentimes in a novel of theirs, in order not to arouse suspicion when captured by law enforcement, in order to have either planned killings, murders, muggings, or to document crimes. Hitler wrote Mein Kampf as part fictional with his fantasies about racial purification, years before enacting genocide and fulfilling his fictional fantasies. There is also another one of these "fictional" documentations of what is to happen, called THE SPARS PANDEMIC, 2025-2028; A FUTURISTIC SCENARIO TO FACILITATE MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURE COMMUNICATION.  Both these documents have uncanny similarities with the modern day COVID outbreak, and absolutely eerie. It is so specific and accurate to the point of "predicting" certain power outages. I will link both of these for you to read.  Bill Gates and Fauci have been financing the laboratories in Wuhan, China, for a very long time too, the very same labs that likely "leaked" the virus. About one month before the first case of Coronavirus, the WEF ran a simulation called "EVENT 201," which simulated a virus just like covid germinating from Wuhan, China. It was depicted as fictious. They also switched off all the comments on the video about event 201 once people started catching covid. They simulated it in order to plan it. Just a little later we get the WEF selling us the Great Reset. </p>
<p>here is the spars pandemic "fictional scenario"-<a href="https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=jicrcr">https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=jicrcr</a></p>
<p>here is the rockefeller foundation "fictional scenario"- <a href="http://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf">http://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf</a></p>
<p>Event 201 is easy to research and find. You can go to youtube and see it on the WEF youtube channel as a matter of fact.</p>
<p>I also encourage you all to do research on AGENDA 21 and AGENDA 2030. </p>
<p>Im not saying anything, but this COULD, there is a POSSIBILITY, that this is a plandemic.</p></p>

        <p>Makes sense to me, if the EU said "we aren't doing this" and opted out of the tyranny, the UK didn't agree.  Now you can't legally flee to the rest of the EU.  You're stuck under their rule.  The causal nexus is there, and I don't believe in coincidence.</p>
