    <strong>"The Rockefeller Playbook" and Operation Lockstep -&gt; The document which factcheck and media claims that "it does not exist" or "it`s got nothing to do with the current pandemic".</strong>
    <p><p>This was published in 2010, and got taken down from their website. The Lock Down scenario contained within, refers to a future pandemic which is extremly similar with what we`re facing now (except the pseudo virus part). Some snipets from the document and the link to it:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"However, a few countries did fare better—China in particular. The Chinese government’s quick imposition and enforcement of mandatory quarantine for all citizens, as well as its instant and near-hermetic sealing off of all borders, saved millions of lives, stopping the spread of the virus far earlier than in other countries and enabling a swifter post-pandemic recovery."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"During the pandemic, national leaders around the world flexed their authority and imposed airtight rules and restrictions, from the mandatory wearing of face masks to body-temperature checks at the entries to communal spaces like train stations and supermarkets. Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"In order to protect themselves from the spread of increasingly global problems—from pandemics and transnational terrorism to environmental crises and rising poverty—leaders around the world took a firmer grip on power."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Interesting how it mentions "envoirmental crises" as the next step to come, since we can see that media (the CNN undercover interview), Greta, Billy, Biden and others, already started to give us a hint that this will be the next mass control weapon. So this will get real very soon i guess. Anway,  enjoy your read ! (page 18 if you want to skip)</p>
