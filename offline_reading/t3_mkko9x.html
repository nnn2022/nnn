    <strong>Who is benefiting from this 'pandemic' and why did almost all the countries fall for them?</strong>
    <p><p>Side question: Who is controlling the World Health Organization (WHO)?</p>
<p>I don't see how corona disease is a pandemic. Health effects are not severe for majority of the population. Only people with low immunity, old people, too young kids etc are the ones who may face sever discomfort. Some cases are even asymptomatic. Disease is only something like common cold.</p>
<p>I don't see how lockdowns help. As for masks, I don't really care. It's only a minor inconvenience. I'm ok with the rule of wearing masks, even though I personally don't want to wear it. But lockdowns don't do shit. Put people indoors for certain number of days. Later tell them, the curve is going down, the risk has gone down, that they can go out. It's safe. Doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>How did almost all countries, except maybe a handful of them fall for this pandemic shit? I mean, who started it? Is it China? So many countries are against China, but they too ended up calling this disease a pandemic. How come? Why almost all countries put in lockdown?</p>
<p>Are pharma companies behind this? If so, which one? Which one is big enough to control practically all the countries? Or is it that they all worked together? I don't believe that too. How did all of them come together and make this master plan? How is such a big plan, if such a plan exists in the first place, such a big secret? Are governments too involved? Don't take me for a conspiracy theorist. Just random thoughts about the pandemic trying to find out what the key issue is.</p>
<p>The side question: Who controls WHO? The press meets of WHO feels like a so-bad-it's-good kind of horror movie scenes. Tedros Adhanos, or whatever the name of that guy is, comes in says shit like, "The pandemic is here to stay. The disease is a serious one." etc etc. Which leader or which country would say such things? If you are a leader would you want your followers to lose hope and feel sad and dejected even if you personally know you are losing the battle? Or would you rather say some encouraging words, hiding how bad the problem is, and give some motivation to your people? WHO acts as the spokesperson for whom?</p>
<p>If you replace the word "covid, corona, pandemic" etc from the press meets of WHO and replace it with words like, "zombie virus, zombie apocalypse" etc, you can use it as footage for some zombie movie. It'll look so grounded and dark.</p></p>

        <p>The WHO is run by the UN, which was set up by the international Z-word banking cartel with the goal of installing a one-world socialist technocracy, the "New World Order". They've never wavered from that mission.</p>

        <p>I'd say it can be partially blamed on the unlisted names of billionaries of Forbes (yes, them), ignorant masses, copycat governments and their followers. I think it started organically but as soon as the first lockdowns started I bet some big people put money on it to keep it going as hard as possible. Some goverments also put incentives to list as much as possible the numbers of deaths and cases, making frauding these number a profitable thing for hospitals or more local goverments. As always, follow the money and see who is benefiting from all of this.</p>

        <p>How does so many billionaires benefit from these lockdowns? Doesn't lockdowns mean lower sales of most commodities in general? Apart from essential stuff like food, water, healthcare stuff, etc, doesn't the large chunk of other stuff like gasoline, entertainment items (be it movies or merchandise), clothes, cosmetic products etc go down during the lockdowns? How are they making some profit during times like these. Of course the pharma companies and people like Jeff Bezos got richer.
In my limited knowledge, I'd say pharma companies and companies selling hygiene products are the ones who got richer.</p>

<p>U.S. government was the number one contributor to W.H.O. followed by <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2020-05-29/gates-foundation-donations-to-who-nearly-match-those-from-us-government">Gates Foundation Donations to WHO Nearly Match Those From U.S. Government | US News</a>, so I would start there. </p>
<p>From that, look at the pharmaceutical companies, to Silicon Valley companies. It is my belief that the conspiracy goes very deep, especially into our government all the way down to the churches. In other words, the folks running the asylum have their hands into almost everything. The question is who are these people behind the scenes, and what are their true motivations. Once you understand the motivation, then you can see who is benefiting.</p>
<p>My bets are on:</p>
<ul>
<li>governments</li>
<li>big pharma</li>
<li>gates/soros</li>
<li>the u.n.</li>
<li>technocrats</li>
</ul>
<p>It all leads to the "passport" and will lead to our slavery.</p>
