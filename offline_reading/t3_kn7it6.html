    <strong>UK govt. refusing to release scientific advisors' conflicts of interest</strong>
    <p><p>According to none other than the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4716">British Medical Journal</a>, which has nonetheless found:</p>
<p>&rt;By July the UK government had signed a coronavirus vaccine deal for an undisclosed sum with GlaxoSmithKline, securing 60 million doses of an <strong>untested treatment that was still being developed.</strong> <strong>In September, media outlets reported that Vallance had £600 000 (€661 000; $800 000) worth of shares in the company.</strong> The government responded to say that,<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4716#ref-8"><strong>8</strong></a> while he heads the government’s Vaccine Taskforce, Vallance “has no input into contractual and commercial decisions on vaccine procurement, which are taken by ministers following a robust cross government approvals regime.”</p>
<p>Untested treatment in development, bought for an 'undisclosed sum' (likely several thousand million) to enrich one unelected advisor.</p>
<p>&rt;Days later, the <em>Daily Mail</em> broke another story, this time focusing on Bell. On top of his role with the Vaccine Taskforce, Bell also headed the National Covid Testing Scientific Advisory Panel and chaired the government’s new test approvals group. But the <em>Mail</em> discovered something <em>The BMJ</em> had first reported in 2012<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4716#ref-9"><strong>9</strong></a>—that <strong>Bell had substantial financial interests, now amounting to £773 000 worth of shares, in pharma company Roche, which had sold the government £13.5m of antibody tests in May. Following the deal, Bell appeared on</strong> <strong><em>Channel 4 News</em></strong> <strong>and Radio 4’s</strong> <strong><em>Today</em></strong>**, calling the tests a major step forward. Yet Public Health England found the tests unreliable.</p>
<p>Sickening, isn't it? I defy any doomer to defend this level of transparent corruption. 'Following the science,' is it?</p></p>
