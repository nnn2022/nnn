        <p>Because Trump dared to make the bold and accurate statement that the treatment could not be worse than the disease when referring to lockdowns. So if you agree with him you are an uneducated racist murderer</p>

<p>I used to always roll my eyes when my Republican friends and family would say that CNN and network news outlets were blatantly biased and suppressed alternative points of view, regardless of their merit. Now that I'm suddenly on the "Republican" side of an issue, I have newfound empathy.</p>
<p>Any reasonable, informed human knows that "children are reasonably immune" is shorthand for (a) children are less likely to get the disease, (b) vastly less likely to have a serious course, and (c) less likely to pass it on.</p>

        <p>I mean all mainstream media is incredibly controlled and self-censored. Even the alternative media is to a degree. It’s all about restricting and maintaining the Overton window of the public. It’s not there to report and provide you with objective facts so that you can use your critical faculties to come to your own conclusions. It’s there to introduce concepts to you, manipulate you, brainwash you and manufacture consent so that they can do whatever they want with you and everyone else. </p>
<p>Independent media tends to work hard to bring you the stories that never make it to the mainstream because they’re too contrarian, expose too much or rather show the lies and hypocrisies of corporations and governments. </p>
<p>As we all know, once the 24 hour news cycle is up, it’s as if it never exists or never happened. Most people don’t remember what they were told last week. </p>
<p>I saw someone ask, “to people who are mask zealots, if the government were to ban masks and make it illegal for people to wear one, would they resist and keep wearing masks or would yield to their masters?”</p>

        <p>I said this in a similar thread: many people have a stupid tendency to, instead of judging a person my their statements, judging statements by the person who uttered them. It's a dangerous mode of thought. And it cuts both ways: it makes them easy to manipulate by those they like, too.</p>

        <p>I was trying to get friend last night to tell me exactly how he expects the US economy to stay afloat with virtually nobody allowed to work.  Do you think the government can just keep printing money and mailing it to people?</p>
<p>Would answer, he just said, "so you fine with people dying?  You don't care?  You want them to die?"</p>
<p>Missing the point of old people and immuno-compromised people dying vs.  The Downfall of Western Civilization.</p>
<p>The truth is they hate America and are rooting for the downfall of western civilization.</p>

        <p>That's actually a theory as to why the US has had so many Covid deaths relative to many other countries that also went through a legitimate Covid wave (as opposed to countries like NZ that have delayed it). It certainly seems more correlative than the lockdown measures.</p>

        <p>Or not having proper kitchens. A lot of lower priced rentals (at least in my state) will say "kitchenette" in a listing, when what that really means is a microwave and a sink. Not to mention that since the 1950s and the rise of convenience food, many people stopped teaching their kids to cook. There are many people who don't even know how to make something as simple as pasta, because they grew up in households that "cooked" by dumping canned food into a pot and heating it up, or baking cake or bread from prepackaged mixes etc. And now you can replace heating things up from cans with heating up microwave dinners.</p>

        <p>I am skeptical about certain aspects of the lockdown/coronavirus but the Trump supporters and racist dog whistles among other questionable things I see in these skeptic subs are really gross and I want nothing to do with that. So yeah I would love a subreddit geared more towards skeptical leftists.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I am pro-choice, pro-LGBT rights, pro-BLM, pro-immigration, pro-eating-the-rich/universal basic income etc., I believe in restorative justice over punishment, I believe in anthropogenic climate change, and while I can certainly appreciate finding some commonalities with people who I don't agree with much, I'm cringing at all the other stuff most lockdown skeptics are into.</p>

        <p>Because things are so black and white to some people as far as political affiliations, that they think if you disagree with them on anything, you must not be a part of their political party. Its the most immature, unintelligent way of seeing the world and I can’t believe how many are that small brained. It’s really impressive how many people are truly that stupid.</p>

Again I do not think our country is really very nature as individuals. We cannot handle anything different being said to us without getting angry and demanding the person to go away or the thought to be deleted or banned.  Very very bad</p>

        <p>It wouldn’t have been like this with any other president IMO. We can disagree about whether he deserves the scorn but he’s been antagonizing the other side the whole time. A president is supposed to rise above the fray especially during crisis. Obama, Clinton, and Bush would’ve pissed off half the country but we wouldn’t be arguing about reopening schools.</p>

        <p>I’m not blaming him alone. We wouldn’t be this partisan if he wasn’t president. If he made a good faith effort to unite people when he was elected, or even in early 2020, I think he could’ve come out the other side looking like the good guy. Even if the death count was the same. </p>
<p>Obama or Bush wouldn’t get into petty feuds with people during a pandemic - or ever. They wouldn’t mock people for being scared (though I agree the media is fear mongering). </p>
<p>They had to put politics aside for a few months and the ball was in Trump’s court. He had a window when he could’ve become a leader. Remember when Omar praised him, and him and Cuomo were saying nice things? That lasted like a week. I honestly think democrats were more willing to put the bullshit aside - as were most republicans. Not everyone but the ones with the biggest platforms were acting in good faith. On both sides, and the cabinet. Trump just can’t help himself.</p>

<li>I don’t think we’d be as polarized with any other president. That’s right. I don’t think Clinton would be attacking people on Twitter in April. If he was the CEO of any company, he’d be fired for the shitshow he’s escalated. He should know that more than anyone. </li>
</ol>
<p>Bush did it after 9/11 when he was extremely unpopular. Obama didn’t have a crisis of that or this magnitude but he’s definitely not the petty type. I think if shit really hit the fan, he would’ve called a truce. </p>
<p>I don’t think reopening schools would be a partisan issue. I think there’d be way more room between lockdown everything and take reasonable precautions in discussions. </p>
<p>There are Democrats who hate Trump so much they want him to call a national lockdown for fucks sake. He shouldn’t be pushing their buttons. They’re just gonna say it louder, and too many people are already complacent. They’re conditioned to want to be protected at all costs. I was skeptical from the beginning but I wonder if i would’ve remained if I didn’t get covid and recover. I hope so. </p>
<p>Maybe I’ve lost it. Every comment turns into an essay.</p>

        <p>I think all this effort to "unite" everyone nowadays is part if the problem. We're animals with small mammal brains that can only really care about a few dozen or maybe a few hundred people at most. Expecting thousands, millions, billions to unite toward a common goal is just folly. Maybe the best course of action would be the peaceful-as-possible division of large nations into smaller decentralized communities of shared interest. Same for large corporations, break them into smaller businesses that have genuine vested interest in the wellbeing of their communities. Though that still probably won't stop the social cycle of liberty and tyranny. Civilizations rise and fall, just like the tide.</p>

        <p>Do you feel Obama or bush would have reopened schools? </p>
<p>I do not like trump but I feel his allowing the states to govern themselves was probably for the best. His handling of the initial part with ventilators and PPE was bad but Fauci shares blame for his lies and deception and also tbh ventilators I’m glad we had as little of them as possible because I am sure we’d have more dead if they had more vents in March</p>
<p>Edit: I don’t think the house or senate are rising any better then he is either and that is on both sides.</p>

        <p>I don’t think they would’ve antagonized people during a pandemic, no. </p>
<p>A lot of people hated Obama but he didn’t take it personally and lash out when he needed to unite. I mean we did get through a few pandemic scares without melting down during Obama and Bush’s terms.</p>
<p>I think there was a short window when the crisis first blew up that he could’ve won over moderates with his response but then he just went back to his usual bullshit. There were like 3 days when he was being cordial with Democrats and then it was back to trolling.</p>

        <p>I actually think you make a good point that is probably true; a President Ted Cruz, for example, while he would be loathed by his opponents wouldn't be quite as polarizing, since Trump seems to have a unique ability to provoke his opponents. In fact this very characteristic is what attracted many voters to him in the first place in the 2016 primaries.</p>
<p>I wouldn't take it too far, though. Much of the social unrest that is often associated with the Trump era actually dates to the aftermath of Barack Obama's re-election, called by some the "Great Awokening" (even before that, as early as 2009 there were concerted attempts to brand the Tea Party movement as racist), and norms of civility were eroding in favor of petty, naked partisanship a long time before Trump started his campaign. So a different Republican President wouldn't be so polarizing, but the partisanship would still likely have worsened, just to a lesser degree. I wouldn't be entirely surprised to see them still arguing over opening schools in this hypothetical other timeline.</p>

        <p>You're simply dead wrong. Any of the other Republican candidates would have been demonized to the exact same extent. The DNC has claimed every election <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-democrats-accept-another-trump-victory-11594405793">they've lost since '68 except for 2 landslides as illegitimate</a>. Trump didn't break the DNC's brain, Obama did. After America elected a very left leaning black man they convinced themselves that the Republicans would never win again, the Trump won. They forgot that America's politics constantly swing from one side to the other, only rarely do we get back to back presidents from the same party.</p>
<p>If Cruz had won we would be talking about Cruz Derangement Syndrome instead of Trump Derangement Syndrome</p>

        <p>I don’t know how true it is but I’ve read that Obama didn’t watch political news because it distracted from the mission. Assuming that’s true, that’s how presidents should act. Trump gets caught up in these daily micro scandals that are 100% preventable.</p>
<p>I know the media took it out of context but when Trump lashed out at a reporter for accusing him of something and then asking what he’d say to Americans who are afraid. If he just said what Pence did when asked the same question, he’d have won the day: “Don’t be afraid. Be vigilant.” That’s it. Then stop talking. Trump would then just say, “You know who’s really afraid, Biden.” </p>
<p>I think even his most hardcore supporters have to admit that he’s been at the very best not helpful during most of the crisis.</p>

It took about a year to realize that most panels are crap, they barely last 5 years, and they wouldn't be economically viable without subsidies. I try and explain this to people. Give them alternative options (that would save just as much energy) but nah, I'm a trump supporter. Like F you man.</p>

        <p>The ones they manufactured 20 years ago. But they were half as efficient. Solar is kinda crap. Though it has its uses. Unless you're off the grid and using it in small applications, in which case I recommend a hybrid system. The less panels and batteries the better. More points of failure= more waste. Low energy consumption is key. Ideally all 12v appliances and lights. If you are on grid stick to the grid and live like your off grid. Also if it's temperate where you live get a heat pump.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's a weird feeling.  I'm a flaming leftist, but I am on the anti-lockdown side.  But there is no way in hell that I would support Republican policies, because despite that we may agree on this one thing, their politics are disgusting otherwise.</p>

        <p>I hope this fiasco opens you up to the notion that most conservative policies are not inherently disgusting, despite how the media frames them. In my experience, the left and the right both generally have good intentions but disagree about how to achieve what's best for the average person.</p>

        <p>I agree with that, and there are some of each on each side of the aisle. Although lately it seems Democrats are embracing the authoritarian aspect more and more. It would be nice if the Republicans would counter by moving more libertarian.</p>

        <p>Right? I remember feeling like I was gonna fall off the face of the planet when practically overnight in March the whole love of lockdown swept across well over 99% of the people I know, a great many of whom are the most left wing, anarchist, hippy dippy, holistic healing, living Earth, community feelings types of people. I felt absolutely stunned that they all sucked up to this sort of authoritarian regime while throwing out nuance, whole health, liberty, most other basic needs and reasons for living in the first place. And I *knew* this horseshit wasn't going to last just a few weeks, when we knew from early on who the most vulnerable people were and that we could have just provided resources and guidance on properly protecting them instead of demonizing absolutely everyone. Sigh...  </p>
<p>And yes, it's bizarre finding solace on this one issue among people who are also forced birthers and transphobes and poor bashers... enh, I'll take support where I can get it, but glad you spoke up!</p>

        <p>Honestly, if Biden wins I think a lot of the irrational political bullshit surrounding the virus will dissipate. As others in this thread have pointed out ORANGE MAN BAD!!! is animating much of this. Republicans freaking out about the deficit and government spending abruptly stopped once it was Trump doing the spending. It will be the same thing with Democrats and the virus. (I hope ...)</p>
<p>My hope is that by inaguration day if Biden wins we'll be well on our way to herd immunity. Texas and Florida are making pretty good progress in that direction.</p>

        <p>It's pathetic.  I am a vocal anti-masker on local subs for my country and the sheer amount of hatred and venom I get is ridiculous.  I've been called a misogynist, racist, "alt-right" and any number of other things that have nothing to do with my opposition to mandatory masks and excessive lockdown measures.</p>
<p>People just suck and are quick to resort to lazy mud-slinging rather than actual debate.  I doesn't help that the subs in question are infested with left-wing nitwits, of course.</p>

        <p>What I don't understand is if Trump and the Republicans - who have a majority in the Senate but not the House right now - are so awful, wouldn't that just <em>strengthen</em> the argument for not giving the government even an inch more power? And for nerfing the power it already seized?</p>
<p>The House could be in Republican control in 2021. Any state with a Democrat governor might not have one after their next election - well, some are practically safe, but not all. Cities change mayors. Anybody who doesn't like the ideals of the Republicans (or Democrats) should be very wary of letting the government take control of their life.</p>

        <p>Well, item number one:  Trump doesn't have dementia.  I feel bad for poor Joe.  He's just a puppet for the DNC.</p>
<p>Also, I'm a big fan of Trump just because he's upsetting the apple cart.  Career politicians don't know what to do with him.  That's awesome.  I voted for him in 2016 and I'll fucking do it again.</p>

        <p>Same reason I voted for him last time, pro-life, more pro-2A than not, wants to bring manufacturing back and wants to pull us out of endless wars even if he's being hindered by members of his own party in the Senate. </p>
<p>He passed meaningful legislation that let me keep more of my money, is trying to cut the cost of drugs and wants to re-open our economy quickly so we can get back to work instead of entertaining endless lockdowns.</p>

All you have to do in order to discredit someone is to associate them with racism or far right extremism.

        <p>Because the standard mainstream way of "arguing" against someone these days is to associate them with an "undesirable group", cast the group as evil, and then give them guilt by association. And since said group is malicious, they never even have to give your argument any credence, because you're stupid/destructive/problematic/want to genocide minorities or whatever other garbage they come up with.</p>

        <p>I'm anti lockdown and I've been accused of this daily since I've become one ( I was pro-lockdown initially).</p>
<p>I'm not even from US nor I'm right wing lol . I'm a left wing European.</p>
<p>I've also had ad hominem attacks for being in lockdownskeptics sub and commenting here occasionally, been called "ignorant, uneducated, anti-science nutcase".  Even though I'm actually a scientist.</p>
<p>I've been called "anti-vax" because I said I'm skeptical of rushed vaccines. The fact that I get my shots every year for various reasons doesn't mean anything and apparently I should just accept them without questions and never question anything.</p>

<p>Literally, it's just an insult that does nothing except inform you that the person saying it is a moron. Think about how many times you get called a racist by these lunatics. Are you a racist? Now think about how many other people and how many other things get called racist by the same people. What's the reasonable conclusion?</p>

        <p>They made it happen with that one day where “right wing Trumpsters” were protesting in cities, especially in Denver, where the main photo-op was staged. Remember, the good-looking “medical worker” with nothing better to do than stand with his arms crossed blocking the traffic of the rabid, drooling Trump Supporters demanding “freedom” with their poorly written signs. Shot professionally from many angles.  The “medical worker” wasn’t really doing much work that day, neither was the equally photogenic female “medical worker” accompanying him.  That’s because they were from a casting agency. That actually was their work for the day. </p>
<p>Almost everybody fell for this staged propaganda event and from that point forward, if you questioned the bullshit you were automatically a gun-toting, racist, low-IQ Trump supporter who was out to “kill someone’s grandma” with your SELFISH SELFISH attitudes. </p>

        <p>The guilt-by-association thing, I think is correct, dating back to when there were a few attempts at lockdown protests primarily in Michigan and California back in late March/April.  Some real folks with real unsavory opinions, and also some Trump supporters (I'm not associating support of Trump with any isms, anti-vaxxers, conspiracy nuts, etc.), showed up and tried to turn the protests into microphones for their causes instead of actually protesting the lockdowns, and whether or not those folks were in the very small minority, the media focused on them.  We do have some of such people within the umbrella of being anti-restrictions, we just have to watch out so that they don't hijack it to make it all political or morph it into something it really shouldn't be, because the more they're allowed to do that, the more the media will respond by focusing on that association.</p>

        <p>I guess because Trump initially opposed masks and lockdowns, plus dark-skinned people are more at risk because they tend to have lower vitamin D levels. I can't count the times I've been called a racist homophobic Trump supporter who hates poor people and old people. No, I'm a lower-class bisexual polygynous female decentralist who supports elder rights and believes elections are a suggestion box for slaves. I am mostly white though.</p>

        <p>It's straight up divide and conquer, just like the entire political false dichotomy with the left/right paradigm. Same as labeling people conspiracy theorists. Same as labeling people anti-vaxxers. Etc etc. It's all the same thing, usually pushed forward by the same people / institutions. </p>
<p>We can overcome it by coming together, ignoring those lame attempts at making us fight amongst one another, and openly discuss the facts, science, data, statistics, history, everything.</p>

        <p>It's easier to "other-ize" people in order to justify acting awful to them.  People on Reddit live in bubbles and only see the Trump supporters as the rabid fanatics at rallies.</p>
<p>They probably don't know many people who don't think like them so they have never gotten a chance to have a real conversation.  On Reddit, people argue against the consensus get downvoted and people see the massive negative scores and don't even try to hear them since the tribe has already spoken.  </p>
<p>Downvoting comments has the toxic effect of silencing different viewpoints.</p>

        <p>Remember the surprise people got in 2016 when Trump was elected? Everyone KNEW Hilary would win despite her being a shitty candidate who cared more about cartoon frogs than actually TELLING us what her policies would be and how they would help. Meanwhile, the labeling began on open Trump supporters. Because it was a movement we've never seen. He was bashing the media, but the media was in question for some shady things already (if you remember that there was a movement called Gamergate in 2014 that some in the gaming press STILL can't let die despite them believing some bad actors meant all were harassers...seems to be the main weapon they got is to label who calls you out). </p>
<p>So many Trump supporters said they would be voting for Hillary because they didn't want the media coming after them. Polls lied to all of us because of it.</p>
<p>So now it's 2020. They don't want that same thing happening again. They want to find those closet Trumpers by trying to associate them with other things (hence the Cancel Culture phenomenon). Of course, the BLM movement in recent months with all the cancelling of historical figures because of them not being perfect people, and now this. This is all despite them having a better candidate in Biden than they ever did with Hillary (and let's be clear that Biden isn't the perfect candidate, either), and people know now to not stay home and think that it's all in the bag, and we know Trump is a damned dumpster fire now. Trump sucks as president and we know that he only wanted it to further his business dealings. It will be a miracle if he is reelected.</p>
<p>Problem is, these people who are dealing with cancel culture are leaving the door open for a miracle to occur. Part of what GOT Trump elected WAS the labeling and the hysteria. Many who were on the liberal and left side felt betrayed because there was less and less room for nuance in the discussions that were taking place. They felt the alternative was better off at that moment because of how their side, who they thought they had a place in, was acting. They were ailenating their loyal constituents by welcoming more authoritarianism and militant practices. But when Trump got elected, the authoritarians and militants only doubled down on the rhetoric, never once stopping to think that they were the reason so many had enough of the authoritarian left, or that those in the right wing cannot stand how the MAGA movement is pissing off the right wing who were trying to find ways to connect with minority groups after they got wiped away in 2012.</p>
<p>Alas, here we are. It's all labeling over something that shouldn't be a political argument but a medical one, over science that can never be concrete enough. It's paranoia over them losing to Trump again because they don't know who people are REALLY voting for in November.</p>

        <p>The simple answer is because it's much easier to attack someone's character than it is to attack their ideas. In order to attack someone's ideas, you must first listen to and understand their ideas, then you must refute those ideas and prove how they are wrong, which is often very hard to do because ideas are often multifaceted and not always capable of relying on objective truth. </p>
<p>With the lockdowns, pro-lockdowners would have to understand <em>why</em> we are skeptical of these methods. It's not because we "want people to die" or because we value money over lives. In fact, we are against the lockdowns because we believe that they will cause even more people to die, which we don't want, and we understand that money is an essential part of living, regardless of whether you're rich or poor. People in poverty generally have lower life expectancies, as well as poor access to healthcare, education, and safe housing. For those reasons, lockdown skeptics want to reopen the economy so we have less people at risk of living in poverty. Pro-lockdowners would have to read the scientific studies that we have read. The studies that said that the IFR of Covid 19 is closer to the IFR of the flu instead of the 4% it was initially projected to be. The studies that prove that lockdowns don't work at preventing viral spread because it is literally impossible to quarantine everybody without significant and/or deadly repercussions. The studies questioning the effectiveness of masks. The reports of rising rates of suicide, drug addiction/overdoses, domestic violence, child abuse, mental illness, physical illnesses going undetected and untreated, ect. They would have to read all of that and still try to come up with their own list of reasons as to why the lockdown worked. They can't do that because the evidence is stacked against them. People absolutely hate being wrong, but they especially hate being wrong when lives are on the line. They don't want to acknowledge that they supported policies and politicians who made the response to the pandemic much more deadly than the disease itself. That would create cognitive dissonance and probably some intense feelings of guilt (assuming they're not a complete sociopath). Instead, they double down on their stance because denial is more convenient than learning something new and growing from it, no matter how discomforting that growth may be. </p>
<p>So instead, since they can't attack our ideas, they decide to attack our character. They call us Nazis, fascists, racists, and science deniers since it's a low bar insult. Most people hate those types of people so by lumping us in with them, it paints this picture of "those people=bad, us=good". They also call us Trump supporters and "conservatards" because Republicans just so happen to be more open about being anti-lockdown and there is a false assumption that all conservatives support Donald Trump, even though there are plenty of conservatives out there who flat out hate him. It doesn't help that some people were also showing up to anti-lockdown protests carrying Nazi flags and wearing alt-right symbols, but for all we know, those could have been pro-lockdowners doing that shit on purpose to make us look bad (which happens more than you think). Obviously, the pro-lockdown media, will specifically pick those types of people to show since they fit the "bad" narrative more than the thousands of other normal, reasonable people attending the protests. </p>
<p>That's really all it comes down to. They have no arguement, so they resort to petty insults and personal attacks. I wouldn't pay much attention to the people labeling us. I've honestly started to tune them out because I just don't care anymore. I know I'm not a Nazi or alt right or a Trump supporter because that's the truth. I'm not about to lose sleep over some loser on reddit calling me any of those things. They're wrong, and they probably know they're wrong so they have to attack others to make themselves feel better.</p>
