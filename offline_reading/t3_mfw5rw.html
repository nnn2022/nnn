<p>What an unbelievably immature, selfish way of looking at the world.</p>
<p>The silliest part about it too, is these people believe they are doing the right thing.  </p>
<p>Imagine "enjoying" the suffering of others, schadenfreude, but then also believing you are a good person.</p>

        <p>Disturbing that people think this way. One of my extroverted colleagues just checked herself into an in-patient mental health facility because of the compiling stress from the lockdowns. She will be taking an extended leave of 4-6 weeks to manage her crisis. Thankfully, our company is compassionate and she will have a job when she comes back to us. Others aren’t so lucky. </p>

        <p>&rt; how unprepared our government is, and how corrupt or stupid some government officials truly are.</p>
<p>But also lets put all of our trust in the government and follow everything they say.</p>
<p>&rt; how everything is affecting people’s including Mental health issues that haven’t been addressed</p>
<p>But you will continue to deny that lockdowns have any impact on the mental wellness of individuals because ThE ViRuS WiLl KiLl GrAnDma. Lockdowns have caused (presently) unknown levels of self harm, suicide, depression, or other negative mental consequences. Social development for youth was stunted by a year of watching a computer screen for school instead of being in a classroom. Jobs were lost. Relationships were ruined. People looking to date have probably had a hell of a year when everything is reduced to online dating apps or zoom dates. Work flow changed drastically to blur home and work environments.</p>
<p>&rt; which then causes people following social media to become depressed,</p>
<p>Get off social media and you won't care about FOMO. Social media is only showing the exciting parts of people's lives. Nobody posts (ok a few weirdos do) their day to day. Social media is designed to make you depressed.</p>
<p>&rt; extroverts are suffering a little bit because they need social situations to validate their life, such as going to bars, dance clubs, festivals, concerts, etc. posting it on social media</p>
<p>Extroverts need those things because they're wired for positive feedback from group encounters. They don't <em>need</em> to post it on social media. They choose to. You choose to follow them and pretend that it matters. </p>
<p>I'm extroverted, I don't use social media, it's a waste. I still need those groups and other people to reflect off of and maintain a daily energy through interaction.</p>
<p>&rt; I mean the small percentage where that’s their ONLY personality trait.</p>
<p>And the OP there seems to think that being introverted is <em>their</em> only personality trait. How dare people be excited about what they do.</p>
<p>&rt; We appreciate what we have more</p>
<p>If you needed a global "pandemic" with political lockdowns and regulations to appreciate what you have, you're a shallow, materialistic individual who probably doesn't value money, time, or experiences. The kind of person to complain over the smallest thing because it's a mild inconvenience or cry that they don't have the right color apple watch. Normal people appreciate what they have no matter the time. They set goals, live within their means, and buy / do things with purpose.</p>
<p>&rt; I just like being at home where I’m comfortable</p>
<p>This is the only one I'm fine with on this list. If home is where you want to be I don't care. Get a job that lets you work from home. I like being at home and having some time away from home finding new experiences and learning new things. Being home all the time gets boring.</p>
<p>&rt; People getting creative and constructive at home</p>
<p>This isn't a new thing. People find inspiration from all sorts of things. Being part of a business / digital marketing program at my university means I need to find inspiration for work. This isn't always at home. But this claim is stupid when it's always existed, you just care about it now.</p>
<p>&rt; Tiger King</p>
<p>Was overrated. Reality TV is a cancer. Probably the most controversial opinion I have in this post. Read a book instead.</p>
<p>IMO the greatest fault of the "first world" is allowing noncontributors or detractors like this to survive in society. We'd be better off without people like this because they for sure don't have progress in mind. They'd rather we all stay indoors and be coddled by the government. Pathetic.</p>
