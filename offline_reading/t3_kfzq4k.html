    <strong>The talk of vaccine barcodes and etc.</strong>
    <p><p>We are born with so many things thrust upon us. </p>
<p>Licenses, taxation, ID cards, regulations, etc.</p>
<p>All these things were out there by people before us and have become to ingrained in society that we’ve had no say in what we actually want and don’t want to participate in. So ingrained to the point that even saying you’d like it gone is considered silly, naive, or heartless.</p>
<p>People that came before me decided that it is alright for my income to be taxed. People that came before me decided that I needed a license to drive my own car on streets I pay for from taxes they also decided I owe.</p>
<p>But we, for once, can decide what we and our future children DON’T have to deal with and that is vaccination ID.</p>
<p>Once it is here it will be permanent because no politician can ever run on repealing something or that because they will be called murderers.</p>
<p>Want to abolish welfare? You hate the poor.</p>
<p>Want to abolish social security? You hate the old.</p>
<p>Reduce airport security? You support terrorism.</p>
<p>Abolish vaccination ID? You don’t care about public health.</p>
<p>Like anything else the government gets. Once it’s here. It stays. And we need to not let it happen or else in thirty years one of our kids is going to be standing I. Line to get his or her vaccination card thinking “why did the people before me agree to this bullshit?”</p></p>
