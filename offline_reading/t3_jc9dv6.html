        <p>My boyfriend’s barbershop was closed down so he said fuck it, and got a job preparing grocery pickup and delivery orders at our local grocery chain. Around 50% of the people he worked with were over the age of 60 (working class people supplementing their “retirement” income). The people picking up groceries or having them delivered were usually young.</p>
<p>There’s nothing quite like sitting at home feeling smug about “saving the elderly” while the elderly stock shelves and do your grocery shopping for you.</p>

        <p>This right there should be proof enough that this is a huge <strong>SCAM</strong>. I was a huge speaker for doing more against this virus back in January but not in my wildest imaginations would I have thought that lockdowns and masks were the answer</p>
<p><strong>Before this virus evolved to a pandemic I would have thought these measures were used</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>January To February</em></strong></p>
<p><em>- Shutting down travel to and from China and any country that doesn't</em><br>
<em>- Much better contact tracing at airports</em><br>
<em>- Makeshift Tent Testing Camps and Medical Places (Most of the early spread was doctors without equipment putting coronavirus patients into hospitals with other people)</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Then when spread is everywhere</em></strong></p>
<p><em>- Paid leave for everyone at risk</em><br>
<em>- Unpaid leave for everyone scared of the new virus</em><br>
<em>- Mass spreading events for young people if Immunity is a thing it's the same as flu for them</em><br>
<em>- Heavy fines for workplaces demanding sick employees to return to work places</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Instead they gave us</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>- Lockdowns</em><br>
<em>- Social Distancing</em><br>
<em>- Brad at 22 WFH in his comfortable business</em> <br>
<em>- Jacob at 67 with Diabetes visit grocery job everyday  because he CHOOSE BAD EMPLOYMENT</em>  </p>
<p><strong>The mistakes I made in my political beliefs</strong></p>
<p>The mistake I made was that I weren't critical in the start in March. I agreed we needed to know more, I agreed we needed to prevent hospitals from overflowing.</p>
<p>In May I believed Scientists, Experts and Politicians should have faced Nuremberg Trials style prison for downplaying the virus. But even back then I knew that our governments could abuse their new dictatorship goods.</p>
<p>Now I believe the opposite. The Scientist, Experts were right. This is simply just a flu for most people. Some articles even claim that the flu is more dangerous for the young.</p>
<p>Our politicians need to be imprisoned for this.</p>

        <p>Or they could have just had the same reaction as they did for H1N1...because by April it was clear that this virus had a very similar IFR. Your suggestions are good for back when it was January/February and this virus was thought to be much deadlier than it actually is. Once the Diamond Princess and subsequent studies revealed what this virus really is...then it became an absolute crime to continue fear mongering and brainwashing the public to be deathly afraid of this.</p>

<p>Absolutely. The lockdowns are a crime against humanity. And yes, I mean that in the literal sense. </p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity">Crimes against humanity</a> are certain acts that are purposely committed as part of a <strong>widespread or systematic attack, directed against any civilians, in time of war or peace.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;War crimes, murder, massacres, <em>dehumanization</em>, genocide, ethnic cleansing, <em>deportations</em>, <em>unethical human experimentation</em>, <strong>extrajudicial punishments</strong> including summary executions, use of weapons of mass destruction, <em>state terrorism</em> or state sponsoring of terrorism, death squads, <em>kidnappings and forced disappearances</em>, use of child soldiers, <strong>unjust imprisonment</strong>, enslavement, torture, rape, <strong>political repression, racial discrimination, religious persecution</strong> and other <strong>human rights abuses</strong> may reach the threshold of crimes against humanity if they are part of a <strong>widespread or systematic practice.</strong></p>

        <p>There’s a grocery chain where I live that has a lot of employees in their 60s and up. My understanding is that they’re good to their employees, but it gives you an idea of how pathetic it is that so many people in my age group (30s) whine and cower at home where the people who they care about “saving” have kept on trucking. My grandfather never stopped grocery shopping and he’s damn near 90.</p>

        <p>Because many grocery chains offer benefit packages and decent wages (better than minimum wage at least) for low skilled work they have become popular workplaces for older people who still need to supplement their income. A ton of people who work at the store near me are 60+.</p>

        <p>Should've been encouraging the young (&lt;40 like myself) to get the virus, hole up for two weeks, and then get out there and provide for the elderly while we wait on a vaccine for them. By now around 8 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered in the US. Imagine if we could choose the least at-risk people to have those 8 million cases instead of people in nursing homes bearing the brunt of the disease burden.</p>

        <p>I was just watching a GMA clip the other day about a young blonde woman in her 20s who was a runner. She got COVID at her dietitian job in a nursing home. Now she’s saying she has trouble walking and needs her husband to help her and she has convulsions on the floor as a result of her “long haul COVID.” They showed her in a special “post COVID clinic” being helped between rooms. Then in the interview she’s sitting at six feet or whatever from the reporter with no masks on either of them chatting totally normally about how scared she is she’ll never be normal again. </p>
<p>I know a woman who claims she has “brain fog” post COVID, and she’s also in the 30something woman demographic and has played up her diagnosis for social media likes.</p>

        <p>No. They're sick. The thing is, people suffered from these same symptoms before this year. The difference was that the world didn't shut down because of them. And they didn't ask the world to shut down for them.</p>

        <p>There could never be a "true" lockdown. A shit-ton of people would starve to death after the grocery stores were cleaned out, there would be no cops to enforce the lockdowns (because they would be... you know... <strong>locked down</strong>), vital maintenance tasks on the power grid would fall by the wayside and mass power outages would happen, dogs would sexually assault cats, it would rain diet cola and pickle brine... and that's just the second week.</p>

        <p>I get what this is trying to say, but "middle class" is not a real class, atleast not in the marxist sense. "Middle class" workers are working class too. They absolutely do not own nor control the means of production. This tweet is misdirecting legitimate anger and grievances away from the bourgeoisie and instead localizes it as a working class vs working class situation. This serves the bourgeoisie. Especially when you see who actually profited off covid, people like Bezos and other bourgeois scum who have increased their wealth by disgustingly absurd levels in the past several months. Not to mention that framing people who, yes, had the "privilege" to be wage slaves on demand at home "hid", is moralizing and idealist af, and is a disservice to labour organizing in these sectors: "work at home" working class people got exploited as fuck throughout lockdown, with more hours clocked in (but no overtime pay), work on demand situations being imposed regardless of normal hours, along with breaches of privacy that largely were mitigated during "normal times" thanks to labour protections. They faced their own struggles, and faced a new ordering of wage labour that is rather concerning. Depicting them as lucky is pushing aside the real breaches in labour rights that have and are occuring and will most certainly entrench themselves post-covid. The situation of women and feminized people's in that subcategory is particularly concerning, especially considering the rise of domestic violence, unwaged domestic labour, etc.</p>
<p>Also, I can guarantee you that frontline precarious workers that had to work in person very much wish to "hide" too. Because this shit is scary. Frontline workers absolutely must be understood as the most heavily impacted section of the working class, that I can, and I imagine anyone on the left, fundamentally agree with. But the root of it is capital, not other working class people who aren't frontline.</p>

        <p>I've seen plenty of middle-class people who never bought into the fear (myself included, I suppose) while there's working-class people who continue to cower in fear while doing their job. For instance, there's so many times I've witnessed or encountered someone at their job who've berated me or others for not engaging in security theater along with them. </p>
<p>Let's not generalize everyone in certain groups as being pro-lockdown. I see way too many people here put all the blame on the work from home crowd when there's plenty of them, including in this fucking sub and at LDS, who belong to that group but also support our cause. Stop fucking alienating and shaming our allies and potential allies, okay?</p>

<p>No you're right, literally every expert, country, and scientist is wrong</p>
<p>It really isn't that difficult of logic,</p>
<p>" The flu kills x number of people every year "</p>
<p>And every year we don't quarantine, shut down business and trade</p>
<p>So if we did, we'd have a comparison to covid-19</p>
<p>And if we did nothing about covid19, the deaths would be dramatically higher than they are with us doing not enough</p>

        <p>This is one of the least official things I've ever read</p>
<p>&rt;The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health – leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice.</p>
<p>So, a lack of healthcare provided. That makes sense in the USA, where we don't have universal healthcare, and people already doing get cancer screenings, mental health care, and many parents are actively anti vaccination (this sub didn't have an opinion on vaccines would it?)</p>
<p>Keeping kids out of school if a grave injustice!</p>
<p>Yes, good thing we have mobile learning and also, you know, still better than covid?</p>
<p>That website has nothing to say that actually compares a full blown epidemic with no safety measures, and what we've done.</p>
<p>Literally none.</p>
<p>Yes, lockdown has negative effects.</p>
<p>No shit geniuses </p>
<p>But covid19 has worse effects.</p>
<p>Wow I destroyed the entire argument of this sub.</p>
<p>Keep posting bad websites that try to look professional though</p>

        <p>Who's to say the lockdowns even helped? It's likely it slowed the spread of the disease and gave hospitals time to prepare, but the intervention could be causing these waves of infections we are seeing now, when it's likely infected people may have just gotten over their illness and returned to normal life, giving lasting immunity to the population. Protecting the vulnerable is important, but there are many ways to achieve that goal. It's more an argument of public policy rather than an argument AgAiNsT ScIeNcE</p>

        <p>"who's to say the lockdowns even helped"</p>
<p>Well, every piece of evidence?</p>
<p>Have you looked at the infection rate curve of european countries vs the usa? And when they implemented strict lockdown? </p>
<p>News flash: they didn't want to either. But they made it through the first wave by doing it, and are starting the second wave now and considering a harsh lockdown again.</p>
<p>We never even stopped the trajectory of the first wave</p>
<p>It's not that complicated. The lockdown worked there because it was complete. Look at new Zealand. Vietnam. Italy. Just go ahead and pull up numbers per capita (because yes they're smaller countries buy that's why you compare pet capita....)</p>
<p>The lockdown didn't work here because it wasn't even close to complete. I'm sure the little we did helped some....</p>
<p>In fact, "who can say" is the CDC that estimated how many more dead with no actions, and how many that died could've been prevented with stronger actions.</p>
<p>Start with a search for the cdc website "excess deaths associated with covid19"</p>
<p>I'm guessing you don't care about any of this?</p>
<p>Edit Oh also they've confirmed there's no lasting immunity.</p>
<p>You can catch it twice.</p>
<p>Meaning "just everyone get it quickly" is beyond stupid.</p>
<p>And yes, even with that, we needed to pace the hospitals, they couldn't even keep up with what happened under lockdown, so there's no way they'd keep up if we didn't.</p>

        <p>Few people here believe COVID is a hoax, but global pandemic =/= deadly plague. You're right, the rona isn't like the flu. More like a cold. Colds kill the elderly and immunocompromised every year. 1 million sounds like a lot, but roughly 60 million die every year. Another few million is a drop in the bucket. Most who die from COVID would've died within a few years anyway from the flu, pneumococcal pneumonia, or a heart attack. COVID just got to them first.</p>
<p>Go on, tell me how the death of an elderly or immunocompromised individual is just as tragic, unnecessary, and preventable as the death of a young otherwise-healthy individual who had their whole future ahead of them. Tell me how the number of years lived is more important than quality of life, and milking every last year out of grandma or morbidly obese AIDS-stricken Aunt Sally is more compassionate than allowing people of all ages to determine their own risk tolerance, take precautions of their own accord, and perhaps come to terms with mortality. Tell me how - after eons of birth and death since life first emerged from the primordial soup - no one should die ever again and humanity will defeat death once and for all with Science!</p>
<p>Tell me how I'm so selfish because I support bodily autonomy, medical freedom, personal privacy, and voluntary association for all. Tell me this is all about mUh RiGhTs, nevermind the visitation rights of nursing home residents or Little Timmy's right to live and learn even if it means a few dying people die a few years sooner. Or don't, because this conversation is a waste of time and energy. This whole COVID debate perfectly illustrates how millions of humans were never really meant to agree with or give a fuck about each other.</p>
