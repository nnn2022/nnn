    <strong>Retail stores finally open after 2 months, but you can't use changing rooms.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm livid.</p>
<p>After a 'huge' spike in cases (3200), 'non-essential' shops were forced to close. Well for the first time I learned just how 'non-essential' these services were.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>I had only 3 outfits for summer because 2 of my tank tops tore and stretched out by the end of last summer.</li>
<li>I have 0 comfortable work outfits for summer because my only light-weight trousers tore from wear and tear just recently.</li>
<li>I have only 1 comfortable bra that doesn't cause me pain. That's right. I've been suffering from back pain for a while and even visited a doctor about it, and only recently saw that it was my non-sports bras causing me the pain.</li>
<li>I only had 1 good pair of light-weight summer shoes</li>
</ul>
<p>Summer is almost here and I'm desperate for clothes. Ordered 2 shorts online and estimated my size with my measurements as best I could. Still 1 shorts ended up a size too big for me and I couldn't return it. So money down the drain.</p>
<p>And then shops open. And I get delighted and so happy and relieved. And then I walk in, and they tell me changing rooms are closed and I can't even try on a hoodie.</p>
<p>Despite these ridiculous regulations the stores are almost as full as Black Friday. Apparently a lot of people can afford to gamble away their money on something that might not fit them.</p>
<p>I am forced to buy something anyway because I'm desperate, but it's a bitch. I cannot just 'estimate' my size, especially for bras, you saw how great that turned out online. Even if I take something home that doesn't fit me and can exchange it, come on everyone's had that one article of clothing where they needed 3-4 try-ons in the changing room to find their size.</p>
<p>Fuck the covid regulations. All people care about now is death by covid or with covid. All other human pain and suffering is completely irrelevant to them. My suicidal depression is irrelevant. My isolation is irrelevant. My slashed opportunities as a young adult living in a competitive world are irrelevant. My back pain caused by the fact that I'm unable to buy a proper bra is irrelevant. Heck one year I had all my underwear rip up in the same month because they were a cheap pack. What if that happened during lockdown? Am I supposed to endure the dehumanizing and unhygienic act of having to wear another person's underwear because of someone supposedly dying of covid who I have nothing to do with?</p>
<p>The most infuriating thing is that most of the covid cases now come from working environments since all the elderly homes have been vaccinated.</p></p>

        <p>I saw someone on twitter say they go to the store, buy 5 things, then go to the restroom at the mall/shop and try everything on with the goal of returning 3-5 of the things they just bought.  </p>
<p>Only slightly more time consuming than changing rooms, particularly if you have room on a credit card for charges and refunds.</p>

        <p>I know right, it's total bullshit. They won't even let you try a coat on in a charity shop. I've wasted a lot of money on clothes which don't fit me in the last year.</p>
