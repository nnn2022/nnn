        <p>I am worried so many feel they need to take a vaccine for a virus which for the majority is not lethal or even symptomatic just because the government has lied to them. There is zero critical thinking. Everyone I know, many of whom despise the UK Conservatives have taken them at their word on this one issue and it makes zero sense to me. </p>
<p>From everything I've experienced in the last year I feel COVID-19 is no major threat to me. I am young, have no underlying health conditions, and have been working very closely with the public throughout the whole time this virus has been active and I have had no symptoms and have known only two people tested positive, one of whom was asymptomatic. I am terrified I will be coerced to take a vaccine which I do not need, because a government which has spent the last year lying to its citizens tells me I have to, and I am even more terrified that not a single person I know understands my fear. I genuinely do not know what I will do if aspects of society like travel or even going to the pub require some sort of vaccine-based pass. I will not take a vaccine I do not need and I don't know what will happen if society suddenly decides I am a problem.</p>

        <p>I have a few questions to help me understand better;</p>
<p>Do you belive taking the vaccine because the government wants you to is an inherently bad thing? </p>
<p>Also im confused about your thinking, if you are in a low-risk category why does that now exempt you from being a possible spreader? Like you said, you are in close contact with the public, and that definitely includes higher risk individuals who are potentially unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Do you think you would get the vaccine if you were in a higher risk category?</p>

        <p>I'm concerned about the hypocrisy of people I know who have spent years having an anti-establishment outlook, especially on Conservative governments, only to fold the moment the right propaganda is given to them. This would be their perfect chance to actually question a genuinely big decision like a vaccination being pushed on the population and they have figured it's easier just to bite their tongues and take it. I think it is perfectly acceptable to question politicians forcing something into our lives especially when they insist it's for our own good and openly attacking anyone who disagrees. </p>
<p>Asymptomatic spread has been debunked over and over again and you are much more likely to spread an illness if you are openly showing symptoms, which if I were I wouldn't be at work in the first place. Regarding vulnerable people who I encounter at work, unfortunately I am not responsible for the decisions of others and I cannot be held accountable for others health. If they have chosen to come in close contact with other members of the public then they have accepted a certain level of risk which now includes the possibility of catching COVID-19. This is a fact of life and we should not put the world on hold for the sake of a tiny minority. Not to mention the fact that there is something unsettling and deeply inhumane in treating others as potential spreaders first, humans second. </p>
<p>I'd like to say I would not take the vaccine if I were in a higher risk category but honestly I would not know unless I were in that position. Right now I do not believe it has been tested enough for the long term effects and its the first vaccine of its kind which should make anyone a little skeptical. I cannot begrudge anyone taking it if offered since we have all been battered with propaganda for the last year and I can understand doing anything to have life back to normal again, but for me my right to say no to something that can potentially cause great harm to my body is much more important than being able to go down the pub.</p>

        <p>Getting the vaccine does not necessarily prevent you from potentially getting and spreading COVID. The same sense of bodily autonomy that guides my pro-choice beliefs also guides my wariness of getting a vaccine with little to no concrete evidence of protection for myself and others. As the above person commented, I’m a healthy young person. I have literally no reason for getting the vaccine if I can still spread to others afterward. </p>
<p>Protecting the high risk is a supposed focus, but at the end of the day getting the vaccine doesn’t contribute to that.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is new, novel, unproven, and follows the same design that has been unable to pass animal testing in the past. We skipped the animal safety trials this time. Honestly, I expect the likelihood of side effects to be fairly small, but given the disease it aims to prevent is so incredibly mild, its not worth even that small risk. I've also watches several friends get the vaccine and get wiped out for a couple days with each shot. None of my colds in the last 6mo have been anywhere like that severe. I'd rather have a cold than the vaccine.</p>

        <p>If I’m expected to inject something in to my one and only body that I have to live my one and only life I want to know that what I’m injecting has been rigorously tested over many years and scrutinised by a whole host of medical professionals. Then and only then will I entertain the thought of having the jab (it’s not a vaccine and we need to start calling it what it is, you know since they all complain about misinformation so much they should start by correcting their own information)</p>

        <p>It feels rushed, companies were literally racing to release one first, and I've read a few things about how it's the first of it's kind. I am seeing more and more information on deaths from it, though it seems it happens in people who are not healthy, which is ironic as they are the ones being given the vaccine first. So many people are reporting feeling deadly sick for days after the second dose and I do not want to experience that, and people already in poor health should not have to either. I also fear long term unknown health effects 1, 5, 10 years from now being that it is such a new type. I am not anti vax, but I am anti new and barely tested vax. I am very healthy, I'm not going to jeopardize that and end up regretting it years later if I'm suffering. I legitimately believe years from now history books will talk about COVID and the failure of the rush to get the population vaccinated and the damage it caused.</p>

        <p>Just flip through the history book... non-consensual or coerced experimental medical treatments always lead to crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>Maybe the first shot is okay, maybe the second shot is okay, but it would never end. Next plandemic you might not be so lucky, and now we're okay with experimenting on humans, and the eugenicists will flock to the position. Maybe a special type will be given to children, one whose effects like fertility won't be seen for another decade.</p>
