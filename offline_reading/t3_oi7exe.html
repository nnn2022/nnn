        <p>There is an article published in 2016 which explains all of this. Here are my notes and copy/pastes from it:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2016 Sept 13</p>
<p><strong>Ego, ambition, and turmoil: Inside one of biotech’s most secretive startups</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/13/moderna-therapeutics-biotech-mrna/">https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/13/moderna-therapeutics-biotech-mrna/</a></p>
<p><strong>Moderna "has smashed fundraising records and teamed up with pharmaceutical giants as it pursues a radical plan to revolutionize medicine by transforming human cells into drug factories."</strong></p>
<p>As he pursued a complex and risky strategy for drug development, Bancel built a culture of recrimination at Moderna, former employees said. Failed experiments have been met with reprimands and even on-the-spot firings. They recalled abusive emails, dressings down at company meetings, exceedingly long hours, and unexplained terminations.</p>
<p>At least a dozen highly placed executives have quit in the past four years, including heads of finance, technology, manufacturing, and science. In just the past 12 months, respected leaders of Moderna’s cancer and rare disease programs both resigned, even though the company’s remarkable fundraising had put ample resources at their disposal. Each had been at the company less than 18 months, and the positions have yet to be filled.</p>
<p>Lower-ranking employees, meanwhile, said they’ve been disappointed and confused by Moderna’s pivot to less ambitious — and less transformative — treatments. Moderna has pushed off projects meant to upend the drug industry to focus first on the less daunting (and most likely, far less lucrative) field of vaccines — though it is years behind competitors in that arena.</p>
<p>Moderna’s technology promised to subvert the whole field, creating therapeutic proteins inside the body instead of in manufacturing plants. The key: harnessing messenger RNA, or mRNA.</p>
<p>It’s highly risky. Big pharma companies had tried similar work and abandoned it because it’s exceedingly hard to get RNA into cells without triggering nasty side effects.</p>
<p>With mRNA, “you can just turn the crank and get a lot of products going into development,” Bancel explained, flashing a smile as though he himself was bemused by the idea’s simplicity.</p>
<p>Outsiders and competitors, looking only at Moderna’s public statements, have noted a shift in strategy that might signal undisclosed setbacks.</p>
<p>From the start, Moderna heralded its ability to produce proteins within cells, which could open up a world of therapeutic targets unreachable by conventional drugs. The most revolutionary treatments, which could challenge the multibillion-dollar market for protein therapy, would involve repeated doses of mRNA over many years, so a patient’s body continued to produce proteins to keep disease at bay.</p>
<p>But Moderna’s first human trials aren’t so ambitious, focusing instead on the crowded field of vaccines, where the company has only been working since 2014.</p>

<p>First are the two vaccine trials for undisclosed infectious diseases. <strong>Coming next is a one-time treatment for heart failure, developed in partnership with AstraZeneca, followed by another experimental vaccine, for Zika virus, which several other pharma companies are also working to develop. And after that, Moderna is planning a human trial of a personalized cancer vaccine using mRNA, something it just came up with last year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The choice to prioritize vaccines came as a disappointment to many in the company, according to a former manager. The plan had been to radically disrupt the biotech industry, the manager said, so “why would you start with a clinical program that has very limited upside and lots of competition?”</strong></p>
<p>The answer could be the challenge of ensuring drug safety, outsiders said.</p>
<p>Delivery — actually getting RNA into cells — has long bedeviled the whole field. On their own, RNA molecules have a hard time reaching their targets. They work better if they’re wrapped up in a delivery mechanism, such as nanoparticles made of lipids. But those nanoparticles can lead to dangerous side effects, especially if a patient has to take repeated doses over months or years.</p>
<p><strong>Novartis abandoned the related realm of RNA interference over concerns about toxicity, as did Merck and Roche.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moderna said it prioritized vaccines because they presented the fastest path to human trials, not because of setbacks with other projects.</strong></p>

        <p>The purpose of the virus is to sell the vaccine.</p>
<p>Vaccines do NOT get developed this quickly. These vaccines were developed ahead of time, waiting for the virus to be intentionally spread, so they could overturn society and Build Back Better.</p>

        <p>Moderna has never before brought a product to market, despite repeated tries.</p>
<p>Pfizer has paid Industry record fines for CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR, including publishing false data regarding drug safety during trials.</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson have just been convicted fir selling Baby Powder that they KNEW was contaminated with Asbestos.</p>
<p>Not a long time ago. In this decade.</p>
<p>We have known that Asbestos was a dangerous carcinogen since the 70s, and have been actively removing it from buildings for decades at enormous cost...
But Johnson &amp; Johnson said "No problem. We'll just get the nations Mothers to shake it liberally into the air around their babies."</p>
<p>THESE are the people you are telling me to trust my health to, when you say "Get The Vaccine."</p>
<p>You are participating in a Clinical Trial that does not end until Dec 2022 (Jan '23 for one of em)</p>
<p>You are taking an experimental drug produced by companies that</p>
<p>1) Have No Experience.</p>
<p>2) Have Lied In Previous Clinical Trails.</p>
<p>3) Released and Sold product they KNEW to be dangerous in order to protect profits.</p>
