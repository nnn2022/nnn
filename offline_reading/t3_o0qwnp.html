    <strong>How to talk to friends and family about NOT getting the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Talked to one of my friends in NYC last night; I'd say she's sort of in between on a lot of issues-- she resisted the lockdowns and masks, but has been grudgingly accepting vaccine proof requirements to resume her old activities.  She asked what my deal is with not wanting the vaccine, and what are the circumstances in which I would take it (she asked very politely, btw).  Here's how I explained it:</p>
<ol>
<li>The overwhelming majority of deaths were among people who were at the end of life or had problems with obesity, diabetes, etc.  Every time a COVID death is listed as a "young person with no pre-existing conditions", they're actually saying, "young person with morbid obesity, but we're not counting obesity as a medical condition because it's politically correct to say that being grossly overweight is healthy".</li>
<li>I'm not 80-something, I'm 30-something.</li>
<li>Even the MSM has said the COVID vaccines only reduce the severity of symptoms</li>
<li>But again, the symptoms were most severe to begin with in grossly overweight patients.</li>
<li>I'm not in the best shape of my life, but my waist to height ratio isn't terrible.  It's in the range of normal (I use waist to height, not BMI, to account for muscle density)</li>
<li>I can get myself into even better shape with intermittent fasting, a healthy diet, and exercise</li>
<li>While COVID vaccines come with numerous side effects and unknown factors, losing weight comes with huge *benefits* in addition to reducing COVID symptoms and very few risks.  To the extent that fasting has risks, I know how to handle them-- I don't know how to handle injection side effects.  Better the enemy you know than the enemy you don't know!</li>
<li>I know I CAN lose weight because I did it before and would have stayed that way if I hadn't had my life ruined for 15 months.  The strategies in "The Obesity Code" work.  I'm following the science here.</li>
<li>Maybe when I'm close to 80 I'll take it.  By then the benefits will outweigh the risks and I'll have lots of long-term data.  </li>
</ol>
<p>She also pointed out that I used to get sick easily, and that's when I talked about stress, sleep, and air quality.</p>
<p>Her response: "Yes, that is very valid!"</p>
<p>Real friends will respect and defend your bodily autonomy.  If you say you want to drop a few inches instead of getting the jabs, they'll support you!  And if you repeat these ideas to someone who's on the fence, they might get on the fitness bandwagon, too.</p></p>

        <p>That makes sense, she sounds like a good friend. I’ve only been pressured by 2 people about it, everyone else who I’m friends with who got the vax is like “I got it so I’m good, I’ll hang out with anyone now”, or just don’t even ask or bring it up at all.</p>

        <p>“I got it so I’m good” is exactly how it should be. If you’re that scared of COVID and want to isolate until a vaccine, by all means do it. Just don’t force me to do that. Then get it and you shouldn’t have anything to worry about</p>

        <p>I’m also in my 30s and here in NYC and have not taken the vaccine. Literally everyone around me that’s taken the vaccine (mom, dad, brother several family friends) has had an adverse reaction to the vaccine. Unfortunately my job is making it very difficult to work there without a vaccine (not impossible, but I would likely need to wear a mask indefinitely and limit in-person communication with people), so I suspect I’ll likely be somewhere in Texas in a few months.</p>
