    <strong>More censorship ranting</strong>
    <p><p>It's a scary precedent this censorship stuff. If we silence other people's opinion or source of information you only get one source. And you can't question that source or else you become silenced too. So what is the point of questioning things at that point? It doesn't exactly promote free thought. Might as well not think at all or question anything.</p>
<p>And now a society is created where people can be fooled into believing anything. They won't think for themselves. We can't discuss different ideas. Maybe find common ground with people you disagree with. Or get a better understanding of someone else's viewpoint. Or be able to reflect upon your views more critically. Or maybe even change your mind altogether. You aren't an individual with your own thoughts. You're programmed. </p>
<p>It's a bit dramatic but if we let people have their way normalizing censorship, how far will they take it? And it is normalized to an extent.  And how long would it take for big tech companies to get exactly what they want if they gain more power and influence?  Could we live in a future like envisioned in 1984?</p>
<p>I wish those who promote censorship would have the forethought to think of potential consequences like this. If Donald Trump can be silenced then so can anyone. No one is safe. Who knows when the "correct" narrative will change. Media will shape the narrative however they want. Whatever is in their own best interest.</p></p>

        <p>I agree, time to break up big tech and their unfettered power. Don’t really care about Trump tho, he’s getting impeached and I’m sure Twitter is worried about their liability even and losing Section 220 protection.</p>

        <p>Trump being impeached means nothing.</p>
<p>Impeachment is nothing more than an accusation.  He was already impeached once, the senate has to vote to remove him.</p>
