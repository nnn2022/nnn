    <strong>Why do people think dying at 80 is some tragedy</strong>
    <p><p>Have people not heard of the average life expectancy.<br>
I’ve seen countless people say “ I want to spend every year I can with my grandparents “  but surely by 80 anything could get you.  You could fall over and not get up , die from a stroke, dementia, a cold. <br>
It really seems like people just can’t accept death at old ages. Tomorrow isn’t guaranteed yet we only want to preserve life not live it</p>
<p>I’d rather be dead by 50 and have lived an enjoyable life then be 80 and stuck in a nursing home kept alive by meds and barely able to do anything.</p></p>

        <p>People are just sensitive about death.</p>
<p>My paternal grandfather lived a long life, dying peacefully in his sleep at 97 years old. Yet most of my relatives freaked out about his death, and wished he had lived longer. I was the only one who didn't freak out... I was close to my grandfather, and I missed him, but I figured it was his time, and at least he didn't suffer. My relatives labeled me as "heartless" because I didn't fall to my knees and cried over his death.</p>

        <p>I lost my grandpa in April (not COVID related) and my family seemed surprised that I didn’t grieve much. It’s sad that he’s gone, but he was 96 with severe dementia. He had a long, fulfilling life.</p>

        <p>My grandma (86 now) died a few years ago, probably pneumococcal pneumonia compounded with COPD and general willingness to die. All her siblings, half her children, and a grandchild went before her. She was ready to go. I miss her dearly, and it took awhile for that sinking feeling to fade away, but she was one of my best friends. This friendship included many long deep conversations about life and death. Even at a very young age, I understood and respected her wishes even if I disagreed.</p>
<p>She didn't want me to visit her in the hospital, didn't want me to cry. I kept the former promise, but not the latter, probably to her disappointment. My brother was close to grandma, but not quite as close. They didn't have those long deep conversations. When I didn't go to the hospital, when I wasn't so distraught as he was, he said some very cruel things and we haven't spoken since. While he understands now, he was so close to being another poor soul going histrionic over COVID. The people we deal with are people like how my brother once was. We can't help them, we can only hope they wake up soon enough.</p>

        <p>Yes it’s something nobody wants to acknowledge that the fatality rate for human life in general is 100%...it’s just a matter of when. There are some 80 year olds that are lucky to be healthy and have many years left but statistically it’s awful for most people. I have no interest in rearchitecting my life for the sole purpose of living as long as humanly possible. People aren’t really living longer they are just being “kept alive” longer with modern medicine imo.</p>

        <p>One of the side effects of a less religious society is that people fear death because they don't have any hope for an afterlife/heaven/seeing the dead again. And also because many religious people find comfort in a higher power instead of believing they themselves control everything. I am religious so I am biased, and I know that not every nonreligious person feels that way.</p>
<p>But I find it interesting that the most doomerish of people are my woke, left, atheist, YOLO-touting friends who now suddenly have to contend with their mortality.</p>

        <p>You've a good point and I'm agree. Most pro lockdown and pro-mask people are atheists and left-leaning, while most skeptical are religious and conservative. I only knows about a few exceptions. I know about a Christian leftist who's scared.</p>
<p>Personally I'm an atheist, left-leaning and lockdown skeptical. I'm also a mask skeptical. I don't believe in any afterlives or objective meaning with life. I think people should be allowed to have fun and meet each others. The restriction is negative for our mental health and well being. We don't live forever I think and limiting the fun we've in the limited time we've doesn't help anybody. I'd rather live a shorter and funnier life than a long and depressing one.</p>

<p>I'm the same way. It's odd to me that people who are atheists don't seem to realize that if this really is their one shot at life, why would they want to spend it locked up, living like a prisoner? Time is truly our only nonrenewable resource.</p>

        <p>Atheist here. When I die, no angels will cry. I’m not a special mother fucker. No one is looking down from above to protect me and I will not be rewarded in my next life for obeying my holy masters and social norms.</p>
<p>I’m over myself and I’m just trying to actually live my short life while I’m around. Anything can take me at any time because no one is looking down from above to protect me.</p>
<p>Life is not holy or sacred and I should be allowed to end it when the time is right. If I’m 80+ and my quality of life is in serious decline, the last thing I want is to be tranquilized and stuck in my room because someone thinks they have a right to tell me how to live. Maybe I just want to pop a pill and end it. I find religious leaders despise the idea of suicide but who are they to judge? It’s no different than this covid safetyism nonsense.</p>

        <p>I agree with your observations, but I think those atheists who fear death are just misguided. Like them, I see my time to be limited, so I want to make the best of it. </p>
<p>I see my life as a curve drawn across the years, going up when I enjoy life, and going down when I don't. My total life value is the integral below that curve. Should the curve sink below zero, I start losing out on cumulative life quality. That's when I am sure I will want to cut my losses.</p>

        <p>That’s probably the most insightful way I’ve ever seen that presented.<br>
I’ve always found people like Richard Dawkins (those who I suppose you could call “evangelical atheists”) odd, because they seem to be operating under the assumption that at some point they will be proved “right.”  When by definition, part of being an atheist is the willingness to accept that you will literally NEVER know if you are.  Hence I almost view Dawkins as more aligned with the subset of atheism that is essentially “God is not real, and I hate him!”</p>

        <p>I've heard it also explained that death is a much more scary abstract concept since life expectancy is way up, and most deaths occur in hospitals/facilities instead of the home now, so people are simply less exposed to the concept.</p>

        <p>The expected lifespan in Europe is at 83.5 or something like that. Dying at 80 is, in my opinion, no tragedy. </p>
<p>The real tragedy is when you never lived life. 
A lot of people live in the past or in the future never in the present. They say things like "i cant do that because of..." or "if i only had that then i would..."
If they would live in the moment with all their senses then probably they would realise that there is nothing to be afraid of or that nothing they purchase will solve their problem or make them happy.</p>
<p>Most people die at the age of 25 and get burried at 80...</p>

        <p>There you are right! It won't stop until we say no!
If we surrender and accept it, it will be a easy game for those who love this rona thing...(silicone Valley, WEF and big pharma)
We need to talk to as much people as we can and bring good energy to those around us. We also need to help them question the narrative. </p>
<p>Last week i was at a family gathering. The first one since march. At first people were hesitant to greet or hug each other. I went in with a big fucking smile and huged and kissed everyone. The energy changed immediately and everyone felt comfortable. </p>
<p>Here is a quote from the Wall in Berlin;</p>
<p>'Many small people who in many small places do many small things that can alter the face of the world'</p>
<p>The wall of Berlin also fell after 30 years! People all over east an west germany fought for freedom and succeeded. And if we are brave enough we can create a better world for our children.</p>

        <p>The problem is that everything, at least in the US is set up for the health care system to get your money. The best value for your dollar is to save it into retirement accounts which you can't touch until you're at least 59, and then some absurd percentage is spent on your last few years. I'd much rather be able to enjoy my money now, but the growth on that money to provide in retirement is too great to turn down. I told my ex-girlfriend if we got to retirement and I came some with some terminal disease or ailment, that I would rather kill myself and let her and our potential kids get that money, than the corrupt-as-fuck health care industry.</p>

        <p>Yep, life expectancy is going up, population is going up. Average age of covid death above average age of death.</p>
<p>Millennials were already set to be the first generation to be outlived their parents, and bring life expectancy down. SO, we are expected to care about people who have lived longer than we can ever reasonably expect to. Not only that, but we're expected to give up the financial, relational and cultural hopes they took for granted, AND pay for the triple-lock pension guarantees of the Boomers who took our opportunities, meaning we will have to work later into life with less chance of decent pensions too. The generation yet unborn gets it worse as they'll have to pay for great-grandparents who died of old age before they even came into the world.</p>
<p>People can't tolerate death, that's why we spend every moment distracting from the inevitability. It's telling these people don't seem to care about the conditions these elderly people are living in, nor the vast array of other ailments that kill them eventually.</p>
<p>Many of the people supporting lockdown may not realise until on their deathbeds that not only were they screwed worse than the generations they tried to save, but that they did it to themselves. It is a colossal act of self harm.</p>

        <p>this is all strictly anecdotal, of course, but i'm 36 y/o and i've done a complete 180 on life expectancy since March 2020. i'm absolutely fine dying at the age of 80.</p>
<p>background: i watched my paternal grandmother live with and succumb to alcohol-induced dementia and Alzheimer's at the age of 86. we took care of her for the last 20 years of her life after my grandfather left her, and the last 10 years weren't pretty. alzheimer's is an awful way to die, and it's genetic, so i'm vaguely terrified. (my paternal grandfather passed away at the age of 88 from leukemia, it was honestly very sudden and quiet peaceful. his death was the only "good" death - no pain, no suffering, no long drawn out tortured good byes. the one kindness he did for us in 20 years, smh.)</p>
<p>my maternal grandmother passed away from colon cancer at the age of 79 after a rapid three year decline. when she turned 70 y/o, she said she wanted to be "old so that everyone would take care of her." well, she got her wish and it was sad to watch, especially as my grandfather poured everything into taking care of her. my grandfather is now 86 with dementia, and lives in a nursing home in upstate NY. we don't know when we will get to see him again, and it's heartbreaking (and he's in a nice nursing home). he says that he misses her fiercely and loves her and wants to be with her again every day. now that's true fucking love.</p>
<p>my great aunt died in 1989 at the age of 90 and she lived independently until the day she died. i had a great great uncle who lived to be 101 and was driving around Florida until one year before he passed away. what can i say? Italians have some good genes, must be all of the red wine and olive oil. (or in the case of my great aunt, cigarettes and rye.)</p>
<p>where am i going with this, you ask? well, before March i would have said that i wanted to live to be 100, that i would live forever (hatefully, lol).</p>
<p>but i've watched my grandmothers die, i've held their hands, i've changed their sheets. i'm watching my grandfather wither away from afar right now. i'm too young to know this much about nursing homes and funerals and veteran's benefits.</p>
<p>i have seen what age does to the body and the mind. i've seen what happens to our brains after the body gives up. i've seen what happens to the body after the mind throws in the towel.</p>
<p>humans are weak and frail and vulnerable - we always have been and we always will be. we can only do so much to stave off death. there's a reason we all used to die young, why we were so susceptible to any number of disease, felled by war - life is meant to be shorter.</p>
<p>yes, i am young and healthy and vibrant now, i have a good immune system now - but that will only last so long. i'm trying to take care of myself now to make it easier on my body in the future, but we're all carbon-based organisms, and eventually, our bodies will disintegrate, and there's nothing we can do to stop the decline.</p>
<p>all of the vaccines in the world, all of the medical treatments we have now, hospitals, food, running water, electricity, the absence of war/famine/plague - none of that can stop the march of death. it makes life more pleasant on this planet, it makes life easier - it can't stop death. we can prolong life, but only for so long.</p>
<p>i now believe that humans were never really designed to live past 80 y/o. it just seems to me that's when most people burn out and pass away. yes, there are always exceptions to the rule, but by and large, the inevitable decline comes, and most of us are ready to go around 80. </p>
<p>i do not want to die old and decrepit and alone and without my wits, i do not want to be in a home, hooked up to a machine and tubes, and pumped full of any number of pain-numbing, life-extending drugs. when it's my time to go, it's my time to go. that's why i have a rock-solid advanced medical directive with an explicit do-not-resuscitate order - i want to go quietly and peacefully and painlessly, a death with dignity, if possible. i'd like to be old in my bed, with the people i love - my family, my future kids, my friends - and i want them to celebrate life. not even my life, just life in general - because it goes on and on and on. </p>
<p>i don't want to live in a world without the people i love the most - my husband, my parents, my brother, my friends, my pets - they will all go to. what will happen to me when my husband is gone? what if i can't imagine being here without him? it makes me cry to think about it. i've said good bye to grandparents, i'm ready to say good bye to my parents when the time comes - i don't know how i will feel if my brother or husband go first.</p>
<p>i suppose i will have to accept it because death is a natural, normal, healthy part of life. time only goes one way - no, not that way, you're not going that way - come this way with us. no good to live in the past.</p>
<p>i want to live now - freely, fully, vibrantly, colorfully - with my friends and family and neighbors and colleagues. life is for the living, and i won't really be living after a certain point now will i. what kind of life are we living now? a crappy one. </p>
<p>i don't want to live forever, it must be lonely and boring.</p>
<p>our mothers give us life and when we take our first breath, they give us death. life is for the living, not worrying about death or prolonging it. i'm not saying that we should al be stupid or reckless or careless, but i can't worry about something that hasn't happened yet and i can't stop anyway.</p>
<p>in the immortal words of Frank Reynolds, "well, i don't know how many years on this earth i got left. i'm gonna get real weird with it." same, Frank - same.</p>

        <p>I think it's due to the shrinking percentage of the population that is religious. Most young people are secular humanists and haven't made peace with the fact that they're going to die. Because of this they are terrified of death. I'm the past most people were more familiar with the realities of our mortality and it was accepted.</p>

        <p>In the past, the elderly typically lived with their family until they died, wakes and body prep were done in people's homes, and depending on where and when you were, half of children didn't live to reach adulthood. They were way more familiar with mortality than our sanitized society where people get traumatized if you serve them a grilled fish with it's head still attached.</p>

        <p>Ohh wait till you hear about what goes on in my area. It's pretty puzzling. The older the coronavirus victim is the ANGRIER people get. People actually got FURIOUS at a 98 year old dying and her family INSISTED she had NO underlying health conditions.</p>

        <p>I can't explain it as anything other than a symptom of a society that's become allergic to disease and death. Popping pills at any feeling of pain, not wanting our kids to get one scrape or cold, looking to blame hospital staff for the death of an elderly relative.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of people for some reason are unable to accept risk of death at any moment as a fact of life. They are willing to do literally anything, including giving up their freedoms and essentially giving up any enjoyment or purpose in life, because of some false illusion that they or anyone can escape death. And they don’t understand that prolonging life is not always best or even desirable for many people. </p>
<p>I honestly believe this might have something to do with the divide between urban and rural areas on how they are treating the virus as well. I grew up on a farm and was very familiar with death at a very early age. I saw many animals die, and many of my older relatives chose to live on their own at home until the moment of their death, even though they may have lived longer had they gone to an assisted living facility. They didn’t want to give up any freedoms to prolong the inevitable. I also had some very young friends die in car or farming accidents, and no one changed their lifestyles because of it. I once lost 3 classmates and a cousin all within 6 months of each other when I was in high school. That year wasn’t typical by any means, but it also wasn’t anything life altering. It was a hard year but it was just what happens sometimes. </p>
<p>On the other hand, people in cities are not anywhere near as familiar with death, so it’s some big scary thing. It’s lost on them that it happens to everyone, can happen at any time and for any reason, and isn’t something to live in fear of.</p>

        <p>Yes, we’re afraid of death. That’s why Medicare is as fucked up as it is - we spend the majority of the budget on the last 6 months of life. Why can’t we just let the 89 year old cancer patient go quietly? It’s because everyone’s so afraid of seeing their parents die they’ll do <em>anything</em> to prevent that, and prevent themselves from feeling that pain.</p>
<p>My mother died when I was 24. She was starting to show signs of Alzheimer’s, was massively depressed, drank too much because she was depressed, and couldn’t walk around much because she had a bum knee. Do I miss my mother, and do I still cry about the fact that she died? Of course. But I’m so glad that she wasn’t subject losing her mind slowly - I couldn’t have handled that. And am I glad that my dad re-married and my stepmom is a few years younger, and healthy, and keeps him active? 💯</p>

        <p>People in rich western societies live extremely sheltered lives. Death and suffering are shielded  from their eyes and hushed up, instead of being a normal part of life that everyone will have to face someday. They have no religious or philosophical framework to process it, because the cultural attitude is that good little consumers don't need to worry their pretty little heads over unpleasant things like that. When they're faced with the thought that someone might die for real and not be brought back next season like a TV character, they panic and meltdown.</p>

        <p>The psychology of mortality itself is a big philosophical can of worms. People have had a strange relationship with mortality since the dawn of time. We fear it yet are fascinated by it.</p>
<p>This is a speculation, but I also wonder whether grievance over Covid depends on knowing very old people. If your beloved grandma is alive at 95, you have an emotional attachment to the concept of “killing grandma.” If you have no such loving relative, like myself, chances are that you would be interpreting this much differently. </p>
<p>You can be the most rational person in the world; but the moment strong emotions hit, logic goes out of the window. That’s why it is important to stay calm during tough situations.</p>
<p>I also wonder this question for the folks endorsing the “killing grandma” mentality:</p>
<p>What’s more tragic: an innocent 18 year old getting life in prison or an innocent 80 year old getting life in prison?</p>

        <p>Also at some point life becomes unbearable. My grandpa died of pneumonia in 2014 (yeah it was a thing before covid) and he was very sick. He had Alzheimer's, unable to speak, on oxygen, bed bound and had to be taken care of 24/7. I don't really remember how old was he, I was pretty young but I guess over 85.
That's the situation for many old folks, maybe not so tragic but still not good. At some point life is not really worth living. Not saying they should not be treated but if it isn't effective then fine, death comes inevitably and it was a thing before covid</p>

        <p>my granfather passed away at 94, it was a relief, his mind was gone just waiting for the body. my g grandmother died at 99, opposite problem. body gave out mind was still here and miserable (couldn't see, couldn't bathe herself, no quality of life and she remarked often she was ready to die). one has to go first and the other can hang on for years, better to get something like the flu and go relatively quick, i'm positive of that at this point</p>

        <p>Because it is. If you're close with someone, you'll probably always miss them when they're gone, regardless of age. But that doesn't make the death of the young to pave way for the birth of the new any less natural or necessary.</p>
