    <strong>I'm not against employer or government mandated vaccines JUST because I don't trust the vaccine. PART 2</strong>
    <p><p>I thought about this today, at work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we allow employers to start mandating medical procedures, they're not going to stop at "just once", see yesterdays post: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/p0yzw7/im_not_against_employer_or_government_mandated/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to employers nefarious reasoning for mandating certain medical procedures (thinking into the future here), how long is it going to take for Moderna or Pfizer to start sending sales reps around to employers, asking them to mandate this or that? Offering "incentives" (cash) to help close the deal? </p>

<p>Fight it with everything you have, every day. We can't let this happen.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely right. Who in his right mind would even for one second think these mandates are NOT the beginning of the end!!!! How on earth could any leader or decision maker even mention this option? Beyond believe! </p>
<p>If this is one day over, all participants in this madness have to get voted out, economically shunned and legally prosecuted. </p>
<p>This is madness. </p>
<p>Stop and sacrifice!  For your own and your children freedom's sake.</p>
