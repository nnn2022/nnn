    <p><p>We released a video 2 weeks ago entitled Human Rights Violation. It currently has some benefits.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Tamil Nadu Postal Department had left a written statement that its employees must be vaccinated. An indictment was filed with the Human Rights Commission. The post office withdrew from the end of compulsory vaccination. Sources are included in the record.</li>
<li>Sri Ramachandra University has issued a written statement that students must be vaccinated. A medical college student has complained to the Human Rights Commission that he had sent three emails to the college administration without receiving a reply. The college administration called the woman and gave her a vaccine exemption. Thereby retaining his rights.</li>
<li>For someone who worked in a private company, because the vaccine was imposed. He complained to the Human Rights Commission and was acquitted.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not a debate about whether the vaccine is good or bad. It is our  personal right to decide which medicine to have. Watch our video to know more.
