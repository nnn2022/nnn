Branch Covidean: one who implicitly believes all official information as if it was unquestionable holy writ, even if it comes from persons and organisations that they know to be otherwise questionable and which can be shown to have been involved in previous corruption, fraud, misconduct or malfeasance.
The Branch Covidean will also follow all ritual practices to the letter and in fact will exceed advice through actions like masking outdoors, or even alone in the car, and excessive handwashing or application of antibacterial gels.
The Branch Covidean will also attack as heresy any scientific opinion contrary to their beliefs, however eminent the source, without even reading and considering it and will denounce anyone who shares this material as a 'Covidiot' or 'denier' or 'conspiracy theorist' and demands that they be punished like a heretic in the Middle Ages by exclusion, silencing and even by wishing death on them - though they claim that their goal is the preservation of life.
The Branch Covidean is able to turn a blind eye to death and suffering caused by lockdowns because they are 'saving lives'. In fact no other cause of death but Covid-19 matters to a Branch Covidean.
The Branch Covidean is prepared to accept or ignore any erosion of civil liberty or human rights provided that it is couched in the language of 'controlling the virus' and 'saving lives': they are also prepared to ignore the re-engineering of the economy under the same reasoning.
The Branch Covidean has essentially replaced any spiritual, social, rational, scientific, ethical or legal values with adherence to the orthodoxy of a corporatist public/private biosecurity state that it invests with the power and infallibility of a medieval papacy.
