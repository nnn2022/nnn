        <p>I completely agree. My entire family, while they agree with us that this is bullshit, also think I'm extreme for being so staunchly of the same mind as you regarding masks and vax. I will not. I refuse to for the sake of my sanity, and I refuse to be complicit in what I see as a plot against my children. </p>
<p>I think it's strange and frightening that standing up for one's beliefs would be considered "extreme". I can't make sense of it. 
It tells me that my parents would have no problem (and likely did in some way or another) compromising my future for the sake of comfort. I will not do that to my kids. Unfortunately, each day that goes by, it becomes more and more apparent that my choices will be reduced to fleeing or fighting before too long. </p>
<p>I'm terribly sorry to hear that you're stuck so far from home in such a dystopic hell. To a lesser degree, I understand your struggle; my family lives in Chicago, my wife's family in Minnesota, and we have no friends here in Colorado.  We also have very little ability to see them in person, and that's hard enough from 1000 miles away, let alone half a world away. 
My thoughts are with you.</p>

        <p>In my view (hope), you shouldn't get too worked up on the "mandatory" vaccine thing.</p>
<p>Wait a few months and see how it develops. I predict, that it won't be possible to give a vaccine to everybody, even if they wanted to. It's just a big show for the media and press to have something to write about, for the politicians etc. to distinguish themselves and for part of the public to have something to "think" about and keep distracted etc.And then think of the costs etc.</p>
<p>And if it goes like I expect (hope) it will, then the vaccines won't do shit anyway (reinfections, no immunity, many mutations etc.) and they will come up with a story, why they have to develop another one that really helps and so on indefinitely.</p>

        <p>if it makes you feel any better, i am a healthcare worker at a large academic hospital and the vaccine will be optional (likely because it was approved on an emergency basis and its long term side effects have not been studied). i predict it will be voluntary for the rest of the population too. that being said, it looks like Australia is insane and you may not be able to visit if you are unvaccinated which is terrible. hang in there!</p>

        <p>Australia in general has become incredibly passive towards oppressive government and conformist in nature. I consider myself fortunate to have shaken the programming.</p>

        <p>They want you to feel this way. To feel hopeless and to just give in. But here's what the planners don't want you to know: they can't <em>force</em> you to do anything. They can only scare you into doing it to yourself. They can make your life difficult, not allowing you to go into shops or get on commercial flights. BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A WAY AROUND THEIR RULES. Always.</p>
<p>You have to decide now if you're willing to suffer through those inconveniences. Once you make that decision, that you will figure things out no matter what, only then you will start to feel better. Then you can start preparing immediately for what is to come.</p>
