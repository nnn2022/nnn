    <strong>Doctors Aren't Literal Gods</strong>
    <p><p>Where is the disconnect with the pro-lockdown covid cult crowd that doctors can and do make mistakes? That doctors can and are bought off (thinking of the many court cases where a doctor was paid to say, actually, X disease a corporation brought to a town via say fracking did <em>not</em> cause cancer in 890 of its residents, etc)</p>
<p>Specifically, I have read lengthy posts, often from pro-lockdown leftists, about how the medical system disproportionately fails women. Where does this critical thinking go? Why does the medical system fail women, refuse to listen to women, forcibly sterilize women, etc,  <em>except for the vaccine</em>? So many women talk about this ruining their cycles and liberals just <em>shrug</em> about it? </p>
<p>It makes my head hurt that they can go from acknowledging that <em>anyone</em> in a position of authority (doctors, police, politicians, etc) can and do abuse their authority, but except about covid. When it comes to covid, doctors and nurses are worshipped like a cult and apparently <em>fuck</em> those women who dared speak about how ONCE AGAIN, a medical procedure is wide scale harming women? Now they don't give a single fuck?</p>
<p>I remember once, when I was 17, a male doctor froze off my hymen claiming it was a genital wart (before I'd even had sex). This horrified a female gynecologist I met with later on for a PAP smear and all my friends agreed it was horrific that the doctor could be so arrogantly stupid.</p>
<p>But now? That same type of doctor is worshipped by them. No questioning their authority! He could freeze off everyone's hymens if only it would stop covid!</p>
<p>I'm so sick of it. So many "you're all idiot conspiracy theorists" from the same people who can't stay consistent to their views for more than a single fucking news cycle (ACAB, never call the police as they are murderers!, except for during covid, please mr policeman arrest my neighbor for seeing her mom)</p></p>

        <p>A family member of mine has recently published a book on the long and continuing history of misdiagnosed symptoms in women. Believe it or not, the review in today’s Guardian echoes some of the things you’ve said almost to the letter:
https://amp.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/07/unwell-women-by-elinor-cleghorn-review-battle-for-the-female-body</p>
<p>Although her research is pre-Covid, there’s yet again a dangerous historical precedent for what we’re seeing. One of the reasons I’m so convinced of my position on the subject. I only hope that one day it’ll all come to light.</p>

        <p>Thank you, yes. Women are treated horrifically in medicine and covid is no different. I'm just frustrated that what I thought was progressing in acknowledging this, was just a fad to my liberal friends.  Unsurprisingly, once again, women are meaningless to the world at large</p>

        <p>I believe it. Everybody I know that used OBGYNs had terrible pregnancy outcomes. I even knew a couple who lost their firstborn child to stillbirth in the hospital. </p>
<p>We did homebirths and it worked out great. The midwifery model is just superior in every way, from my experience, and much more respectful toward mothers.</p>

        <p>I had midwives while I was there, I was just having some liver issues (something about bilesalts I honestly don't remember) and they wanted me to be induced-  but I remember they acted WEIRD about it, you know? We were with the doctors and the midwives had very right lips, the nurses were insisting my baby would DIE if I went home (I would likely give birth before the tests concluded I had the bilesalts issue)  and the midwives said do what you need to do, always just glaring at the nurses. It was really strange. I panicked and decided to stay, get induced. By day three the doctor literally said "we can't wait forever. Other people need the room" and I had Picotin or whatever it was called. Then I pushed for four hours, and I wasn't tired, and I wasn't allowed to keep pushing. The doctors tried to force me to have a csection after a half hour. Literally four of them can in. My midwives helped me here and said I had a right to push if I wanted to.</p>
<p>But then by four hours yup, I'm forced into a csection. I didn't have anyone with me besides my panicked, drugs/surgery/hospital loooving mother so my options were limited. Ha. But it gets worse. So the epidural doesn't work. Doesn't work again. Then a spinal tap doesn't work. My back is a black checkerboard at this point. So they opt to put me under and the anesthesiologist man didn't even look at me, I remember actually shrieking at him to STOP before starting it because I needed a minute. The midwife that stayed with me was mad too. He acted like I literally did not exist. They invited nursing students in (I gave permission as I assumed they would be decent) and discussed me and my body so disgustingly I was horrified. I was NOT a person.</p>
<p>Anyways, no one told my mother what was happening. Apparently walked past her for the better part of an hour, when she was supposed to be allowed in the room in barely five minutes. My midwife left during the surgery for something and was startled and brought her back right as my baby was removed </p>
<p>Also, for being an unwed mother and crying, mid labor and heavy drugs that I "never wanted this" (about the PAIN) I had to see a social worker, while coming off anesthesia, but thankfully both my midwife and my mother lost their minds that the hospital was so... insane.  I had a good job, had a degree, had no criminal history, had good support for the baby etc but hooooo boy the nurses jumped at the chance to call CPS.</p>
<p>Also, the social worker put in my file I used heavy drugs because I TOLD HER THEY GAVE ME PAIN MEDS. I actually had to have this fixed a few months later, the next worker (who legally had to check up on me) told me and said she was gonna change it, since I had my own very clean home and the baby was clearly very happy and fat.</p>
<p>Jesusssss hospitals are a nightmare.</p>

<p>Before all this, if you were a woman complaining of "diffuse symptoms" like muscle aches, neurological issues, pain, fatigue, etc, it was a 100% shot that you'd be called a mental patient and just told to take some Prozac and pull yourself together. No matter what.</p>

        <p>Doctors are basically body-mechanics. Some are good at their jobs, some are bad, but unless they actually have a PhD and/or work in research they aren't automatically "scientists" like everyone wants to claim. I never had anything as physically awful happen to me but I have had multiple doctors accuse me of lying or blame me for experiencing side-effects when I mention my experiences with particular medications. As if horrible, life-altering side-effects are fun or something. </p>
<p>I think the desire to believe doctors are omnipotent comes from a desire to feel safe. In a perfect world we would go to a doctor with an aliment, they would get it right 100% of the time, and we would walk away cured. Scared of Covid? Here's a vaccine so you can be assured you won't get sick! But of course that isn't how life works. The human body is incredibly complicated, reactions vary widely from person to person, and there is still a lot we don't understand. Most people would rather have a false sense of security than even acknowledge the unknown.</p>
