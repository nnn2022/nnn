    <strong>Are people aware of viable, proven to be safe and effective alternative treatments to a vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>There is at least one drug already in existence which has proven time and time again to both treat these symptoms and prevent illness from even happening if taken retroactively.</p>
<p>Most discussions i've seen seem to revolve around should someone take the vaccine or not, as if it's the only option available.</p>
<p>Do people not know of a Nobel prize winning drug which has been in existence for maybe 60 years with an amazing track record for safety? Also, it's incredibly inexpensive to produce and purchase so we don't have to spend the entire public purse leaving the population collectively poorer when basic public services are already stretched thin.</p>
<p>God knows that the main news outlets only focus on promoting the jab so maybe people are largely unaware of the options.</p></p>

        <p>This is really the key point.  If, just for example, a treatment of HCQ, zinc, and an antibiotic all approved for general use,  were to be approved as a treatment, the emergency authorization for (all) vaccines in the US would be revoked. </p>
<p>So it ain't gonna happen.</p>

        <p>Everyone who can read is aware of ivermectin by now, but like u/Bobanich pointed out, if it was officially approved as treatment for covid, emergency use authorities for vaccines would need to be rovoked, and since contracts for the vaccines were already signed.... Even if the authorities wanted to do the right thing, there's still the matter of admitting that they just tossed gazillions for nothing, which is something they'll never do.</p>

        <p>It's way more insidious than that.</p>
<p>I really don't believe this is just about companies profiting. There's something in that vaccine that's meant to harm the population. This is why they've been pushing it so hard since the beginning. Yes, since the very beginning, they've been saying the vaccine is the "only way" even though there's no reason for them to have said that way back in March 2020.</p>

        <p>Maybe you're right, but I'm thinking that if I was to plan something like that, I'd probably add something to people's water supply instead. Seems cheaper and much easier to execute</p>

        <p>Adding "something to people's water supply" won't alter DNA like this vaccine seems to. There's a reason they've chosen this method.</p>
<p>Oh, and the government has put "something to people's water supply" before, by the way. They've even plainly admitted to it in some cases.</p>

        <p>Actually, you could absolutely do that this way. Nature was doing that since like forever. Where do you think that 8% of viral dna in your own genome comes from? Also, not all of the vaccines on the market are mRNA, so there's that. And... Like you've said, they did add stuff to water before, they know how to do that, so why jump trough all the extra hoops now? ;)</p>

        <p>There's a reason they've chosen this method. Period.</p>
<p>They might seem stupid, but these monsters are anything but. If they could enact their plans by poisoning food and water, then they would have (and have in other cases). There's a reason they need people to inject this shit into their veins, we just don't know the reason yet.</p>

        <p>Thank you for dropping links, this is exactly the kind of information which is being suppressed.</p>
<p>I've heard of a world spanning collection of medical professionals who have collated so much data on these things. Literally the last thing needed is the Health Organisations who hold authority to look at the information. Information the public has access to. And approve it's use.</p>
<p>For whatever reason this is not being done.</p>

        <p><em>It goes beyond that, as apparently the FDA EUA (to promote synthetic "vaccines") is sticking around soley to protect children under 12 years old, as other treatments have been approved...</em></p>
<p><strong>The FDA EUA is literally useless since Nov 2020 when they declared Remdesivir an approved treatment for Covid:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remdesivir is an FDA-approved</strong> (and sold under the brand name <strong>Veklury</strong>) intravenous antiviral drug for use in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kilograms (about 88 pounds) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.</p>

        <p>How about you just take the vaccine which has been proven to work instead of some other weird method or treatment which has been proven to be useless against covid. And approved treatments for covid only make it less severe. They don’t prevent you from catching it in the first place and spreading it to others</p>

        <p>Well put it this way, what is the best way to protect YOURSELF from severe covid? Well even though some people can get covid after getting the vaccine, it’s never bad enough to require hospitalization. And with treatments, you already have to be in the hospital to get them, so it’s always worse when you have to get a treatment. And if you’re worried about getting blood clots from the AZ vaccine, I’ll let you know that the odds of that happening are somewhere between 1 in 100,000 and one in a million. For reference, your odds of getting stuck by lightning are about 1 in 500,000. So make your pick</p>

        <p>The best way to protect myself is to promote a healthy bodily system. Not just "Oh I feel fine, i'm healthy!" I mean actual health.</p>
<p>This protects those around me also, if I do contract an illness my body is equipped to deal with it effectively meaning any illness will not be active long enough to be contagious. Leaving my body with effective antibodies should I come across the illness again.</p>
<p>On top of that there are tried, tested, effective treatments to support my immune system.</p>
<p>Then we also have the fact that vaccines only work if the particular strain in the jab is what you happen to catch.</p>
<p>What's your plan? Get jabbed whenever you are told to and hope the magical mystery cocktail swimming around your system doesn't do you any mischief?</p>
