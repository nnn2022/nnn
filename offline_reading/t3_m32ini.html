    <strong>Its really ironic how we are always blamed for the "pandemic" never going away, yet every single person I know who is against the new normal never got sick, and everyone I know who worships masks and lockdown are the ones that got covid ?</strong>
    <p><p>seriously I just thought about it, and all the people I know who are so supportive of the masks and lockdown always posts about either they or someone in their circle caught the virus, and all of my friends who are against lockdowns and the mask mandate actually never got sick. YET doomers are always so quick to blame US for the pandemic never going away..  It seems that only doomers are actually getting sick. Those idiots never cease to amuse me.. what a bunch of idiots.</p></p>

        <p>Now the thing is, the doomers will say "because the masks protect others, so of course the people not wearing masks were fine, and of course the people wearing masks got sick!  The people not wearing masks were selfish and caused this!"</p>
<p>Except to believe that narrative, you have to believe anti-maskers didn't spend time with other anti-maskers.</p>

        <p>Does nobody remember just a month ago when everyone was going to die because of the Super Bowl celebrations?</p>
<p>What happened with that?  How come there isn't a big surge?  Why aren't all the heathens now dying??</p>
<p>Of course, the observant and inquisitive mind will ask this question.  But Doomers are obviously neither observant, nor inquisitive.  They will have erased their criticisms in their own minds.</p>

        <p>The types of people that sloth around watching 24/7 news coverage likely to be vulnerable population (elderly, diabetic, hi-blood pressure, etc).</p>
<p>Those same types are also likely to go to places where sick people go, in order to get false-positive Covid test, thus exposing them to higher concentrations of Covid.</p>
<p>They also tend to have a low understanding of science, so even though they follow mask mandates and social distancing, all of their other daily habits are unsanitary.</p>
<p>Anti-maskers tend to be younger, fitter (hikers, joggers, gym-goers), more scientifically educated (have been habitually sanitary in daily life before and during Covid).</p>
<p>Also, since anti-maskers tend to be more active, they’ve strengthened their immune systems by exposing themselves to nature and socializing.</p>

        <p>Amen! The maskers wear their mask wrong and touch it/play with it 99% of the time. I have friends in med school that don't even know how to properly wear a mask. They get bacterial pneumonia and it gets called covid. Also anti maskers are far less likely to even go test themselves, so the majority of positive tests are from people who trust the narrative.</p>

        <p>Only they take them seriously if they were tested.  Lots of them are hypochondriacs.   I know someone who is a hypochondriac (was before covid, yet weirdly never became a doomer) and he thought he had it several times, never tested positive.</p>

        <p>I've wondered if "covid 19" is nothing more than a psyop on a global scale. How come only the people who believe in it catch it? </p>
<p>Keep in mind the thing that we generally call "covid 19" is actually nothing more than a collection of symptoms.  It's not a virus, the virus is called sars coronavirus, but we dont talk about that.</p>
<p>The people who obsess and ruminate on the symptoms eventually end up manifesting them in their reality. As someone else said, it's the law of attraction. They are so infatuated with getting it that they actually develop it.</p>
<p>What if this whole pandemic is nothing more than psychological warfare? This is kind of out there as far as conspiracy theories go but to some degree it fits the alternative narrative that's being pushed these days. </p>
<p>We have popular docu-films like "The Secret" on Netflix which focus on the law of attraction and the minds ability to influence and manifest intentions in the real world. In this case the doomers and ruminators are manifesting their intentions to get sick.</p>
