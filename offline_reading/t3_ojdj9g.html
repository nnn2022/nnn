    <strong>Serious discussion on Sinovac.</strong>
    <p><p>In one of my earlier posts I had mentioned that Malaysia has chosen Pfizer, AZ and SinoVac for the vaccination program which began nearly 5 months ago.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Short introduction.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>SinoVac differs from Pfizer and AZ that it is not mRNA, but produced using traditional method of deactivated virus, with the C-19 pathogen is killed or weakened, hence no longer able to reproduce and infect. But AFAIK the spike-protein on the surface of the virus is still present. So, spike-protein, stimulate "immune response" and all that.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is Sinovac safe?</strong></p>
<p>In Malaysia, among the Chinese community (which I belong to), while pro-vax sentiment is quite high (thanks to the 24/7 media campaign), many are quite skeptical to the Pfizer and AZ vaccines and they are (surprisingly) aware of the adverse events overseas via social media. Which leads them to believe that the Sinovac jab is safer, because after all, it is <em>not mRNA</em>, and you know, Chinese-made. Even some of my relatives are enthusiastic. "Ethnic nationalism" may have played a part. Not to mention most Chinese-language media here are sympathetic to the CCP.</p>
<p>That aside, is SinoVac really safe?</p>
<p>Knowing our government, they are being opaque and has so far refused to release any data on adverse reactions and even deaths (for all vax brands). So there's no official data like VAERS here. To date most of us only rely on a private Telegram group (<a href="https://t.me/aeficovidvax"><code>t.me/aeficovidvax</code></a>) to collect such cases. So far I got 57 deaths, mostly Pfizer. For SinoVac I got 5 or 6 cases. Heart attacks, strokes, the same symptoms of Pfizer and AZ. In fact, based on the cases I collected, SinoVac may have caused more deaths than AZ thus far.</p>
<p><strong>3. Philippines.</strong></p>
<p>Our neighbour the Philippines also chose SinoVac, along AZ, Pfizer, and the Russians' Sputnik-V.</p>
<p>According to FDA Philippines (<a href="https://www.fda.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Reports-of-Suspected-Adverse-Reaction-to-COVID-19-Vaccines-as-of-04-July-2021.pdf">1</a>), serious adverse reactions include fatal cases. To date they have received 1,073 cases of serious adverse reactions.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/b1xnpr26mya71.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eb70b3939ff53afad984c012c550e7af633cd77</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/409jwzt7mya71.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35ec13eeece912c8918f5e5fb79f36bd479717fa</p>
<p>Source:</p>
<p>Of the 1,073 serious cases, 520 (nearly half) of cases are from CoronaVac (SinoVac).</p>
<p>FDA Philippines also stated that there are 382 fatal cases.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/496imq1jmya71.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47eccc1164e747e8372a027609cadda6b321e7ae</p>
<p>No breakdown by vaccine brand was given. But one can make a rough estimate based on the number of serious cases: 382 * (520/1073) = 185 cases.</p>
<p><strong>4. Hong Kong.</strong></p>
<p>SinoVac is also used in HK along Pfizer Comirnaty. To date 4.5 million doses were issued (<a href="https://www.covidvaccine.gov.hk/en/">2</a>), with 2,052 adverse event reports received for SinoVac.</p>
<p>82 deaths were reported thus far (<a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/effectiveness-of-chinese-vaccines-questioned-while-sinovac-biotech-profits-soar_3852449.html">3</a>, <a href="https://www.thestandnews.com/society/%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E%E6%9C%AC%E6%9C%88%E5%A2%9E-4-%E4%BA%BA%E6%89%93%E9%87%9D%E5%BE%8C%E6%AD%BB%E4%BA%A1-%E5%85%A9%E4%BA%BA%E6%89%93%E7%A7%91%E8%88%88%E5%BE%8C-14-%E6%97%A5%E5%85%A7%E9%9B%A2%E4%B8%96-%E8%A1%9E%E7%94%9F%E7%BD%B2%E6%8C%87%E6%B2%92%E6%9C%89%E8%AD%89%E6%93%9A%E8%88%87%E7%96%AB%E8%8B%97%E6%9C%89%E9%97%9C">4</a>, <a href="https://www.drugoffice.gov.hk/eps/do/tc/doc/Safety_Monitoring_of_COVID-19_Vaccines_in_Hong_Kong.pdf">5</a>). It is not exactly known how many cases are associated with SinoVac and how many cases are associated with Pfizer.</p>
<p><strong>5. The CCP's claim.</strong></p>
<p><em>The Epoch Times</em> (<a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/effectiveness-of-chinese-vaccines-questioned-while-sinovac-biotech-profits-soar_3852449.html">3</a>) reported that by May 1st, 265 million doses were issued in China, and of which, 31,400 adverse reactions including 188 "serious cases" were reported. No fatal cases were mentioned.</p>
<p>31,000 adverse reports, and less than 200 serious cases out of 265 million doses? Personally I think that's a statistical improbability.</p>
<p>Comparing with Hong Kong's reporting rate, one should get 122,000 adverse event reports from the mainland</p>
<p><strong>6. Conclusion.</strong></p>
<p>Is SinoVac really "safe" because it is non-mRNA? I'm afraid not. There is a serious lack of data and transparency to allow informed consent</p></p>

        <p>AZ uses adenovirus, like J&amp;J’s. From my understanding, adenovirus and mRNA are both trojans to get into cells and elicit the creation of spike proteins, which the immune system then responds to. Therefore, both methods are essentially the same function, and produce the same end results. </p>
<p>Adenovirus and mRNA essentially create a “synthetic virus” (so to speak) while it seems Sinovac uses the actual virus. All of these vaccines need to induce spike protein creation in order for the immune system to create applicable antibodies. </p>
<p>Until we understand what function of mRNA/adenovirus vaccines are causing severe adverse events, we definitely aren’t be able to say “non-mRNA vaccines are safer”. </p>
<p>I believe most, if not all C-19 vaccines still use adjuvants, which have been identified as a contributor to severe AE. Sinovac most certainly has these as well. On the surface, that’s my biggest concern which already has scientific backup: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7046028/</p>

<p>Personally I think the spike proteins are also to blame. The difference is that the spike proteins are readily available in SinoVac, while Pfizer and AZ only have the genetic "recipe" that the body needs to utilize to produce the spike proteins.</p>
<p>But, yes, I do not dismiss the role of the chemical additives. God knows what those additives are</p>

        <p>I think the conclusion you come to about sinovac being unsafe is a bit misleading. As has been reported previously about Pfizer and other vaccines, attributing adverse reactions to the vaccine is difficult when inoculating the old, frail, and at-risk. Not only may they be far more likely to experience adverse reactions, but separating an adverse reaction from an event that they would have suffered regardless is very difficult.</p>
<p>The data that is available shows a very low percent of adverse reactions. If we then assume that some proportion of those reactions are events that are unrelated to the vaccine but get reported anyway, then we have a even lower likelihood of adverse reactions expected.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, the risk presented by any of the major vaccines today is statistically insignificant in the general population.</p>

        <p>1.</p>
<p>(Sinovac) the issue is lack of data, possibility of under-reporting. </p>
<p>my point is, data from China does not seem to be proportional with HK and Philippines.</p>
<p>So I do not understand why so many people in my country are so quick to tout that SV is absolutely safe when it is mathematically impossible to be so.</p>
<p>Comparing with Pfizer, at least there is plenty of data and incidents, and we can be confident to state that it is hazardous. For SV, the scant data makes us even more uneasy, so to speak</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>(Applies to all vax brands) it is statistically insignificant in the general population FOR NOW, but we do not know for sure what will happen 6 to 36 months from now. Some adverse reactions show up immediately, some in a few days, some may take years to manifest.</p>
<p>If one compares to other vaccines (BCG, tetanus, polio etc), never has a "vaccine" caused so many casualties in such a short duration (less than 1 year)</p>

        <p>Well, in my personal opinion, Sinovac is unlikely to produce more serious side effects than AZ or mRNA vaccines; however, the biggest problem is that it seems like it offers very little protection against delta variant which is soon to be dominant in Malaysia. So it might be that the current vaccination efforts will be just a waste of resources and time.</p>
