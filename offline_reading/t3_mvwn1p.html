    <strong>Masks in school</strong>
    <p><p>(Part 1 of 2)I feel itâ€™s complete bullshit that we have to wear masks at all. This subreddit already knows that masks do absolutely nothing, so why even wear it? Thatâ€™s why I finally decided to stop listening to the government, and take back my freedom. Iâ€™m in hawaii as a 9th grader, in a sheep state where people comply because they are pussies. Anyways my whole point is that even tho one of my teachers thinks we should get vaccinated, and another wears 2 masks like an idiot, I am not like them, and have stopped wearing the mask completely. Nobody is gonna trample on my freedom anymore, not even the security guards there nor cameras. Since taking it off, I havenâ€™t gotten asked to put it on or nothing, people havenâ€™t said anything so far. This just proves that if we all stand up for ourselves, our freedoms will be back. Thank you for reading this, have a great day and hereâ€™s a cupcake <em>gives cupcake</em></p></p>

        <p>Aloha from Maui, keep doing what you're doing. Hopefully your parents can respect you for standing up for what you think is right. The sheeple on Maui are mindless bitches and the Clownifornians that come here are too. The only time I can't get away without one is on a plane but I fly frequently,  take it off the secind I'm off the plane, refuse to sign anything, refuse to test, and do not quarantine. They are lieing to all the scared little bitches, as a US citizen and resident of the state you have the Constitutional right to travel freely. 14 trips in the past year, I don't even have to make a scene at the airport anymore because they don't want others to know. My kid has never worn a mask and will never get the jab, you shouldn't either. Keep fighting back bro!</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for the support :)
My mom doesnâ€™t support me and will probably force me to take the vaccine, so Iâ€™ll ether run away in hawaii (Iâ€™m on Oahu) or in Florida. For real tho they donâ€™t know that they are being played so hard by the government. Good job on standing up to the people in the airport, fuck their stupid complyments. DAMNN you got everyoneâ€™s respect for standing up to them. Just like u said, itâ€™s the 4th amendment in the constituency to not question our health, so all we have to say is we have a medical condition but donâ€™t have to say anything. If I ever get to Maui, can we go into stores unmasked and see how many we can get kicked out of ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Thank you so much for being an amazing parent to your kid, youâ€™ve done a great job on teaching them the truth! I will keep trying but like I said I need to run away if they enforce it on me.</p>

        <p>Costco and Wholefoods are for the super Nazi's, the rest just ask and I say okay but turn around and don't. I've put money on the counter and told them to keep the change as I walked out with a cart full of shit but that was early on. It's the sheeple that try to ssy shit and I enjoy telling them to eat a dick they're NOBODY AND HAVE NO AUTHORITY.</p>
<p>I hate to say it but the pressure to get the jab is only going to get worse and they'll even try to blame you not getting it on the continued bullshit but it's the compliant sheeple blaming everyone except the people making decisions that are keeping this bullshit going. There has never been, nor will there ever be a cure for the common cold and that's what this was and they are literally just replacing the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Ask your parents why all the homeless are still okay, I'm sure you still recognize the same ones in your area just like you still recognize everyone at the grocery store that's been in contact with everyone but they're still okay too. I bet they won't even try to answer.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™ll try not to support Costco, sucks that no local business is here to support us for our freedom. Lmaoo glad u donâ€™t take shit from them and true they are just a regular person, they have the same amount of power as we do. </p>
<p>For real tho I saw in r/politics about how they are blaming it on us, we havenâ€™t done anything. At least we are smart enough to not take the mark of the beast. Yeah, thereâ€™s a holy ointment thatâ€™s in the Bible that cures stuff. The flu is the same thing as covid, people are getting worked up for nothing. Why do people support it while itâ€™s slowly killing them? Exactly since people just comply we are stuck in this forever loop. The jab will be enforced soon enough, which is why we should probably do something quick. Do you believe the new world order is real? 
Because if u believe with me, we need to get tf out of Hawaii and go to a place where people like us canâ€™t be bothered.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll try to ask them. possibly theyâ€™ll be stunned and canâ€™t answer but I feel theyâ€™ll still reject my opinion or make up some bull crap. Iâ€™ll tell my teachers this and show them a video of how the masks donâ€™t work too. Hopefully theyâ€™ll be stunned like u said tho</p>

        <p>Public school is for the mindless peasants. Homeschool your children, people!!! In most states, itâ€™s easy to initiate the homeschool process.</p>
