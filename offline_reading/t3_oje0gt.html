    <strong>I want to be wrong so bad</strong>
    <p><p>I want to be wrong in the way that I feel about the covid jabs. Wrong in believing that a significant number of people experience deathly or physically incapacitating side effects. That believing in something else happening; such as a hidden agenda is bollocks. That it is entirely stupid to not get jabbed because I could be helping the “greater good” and then maybe I would be able to travel again and see my parents / other family abroad once more.</p>
<p>I desperately want to be wrong so I can get the jab and move on with my life.</p>
<p>But deep down. No matter how much I try to consider. My gut / intuition keeps telling me something is completely off. It rings the loudest I have ever felt before. </p>
<p>And it says no.</p>
<p>I don’t care about how people perceive me as, for not taking the vax.</p>
<p>I will struggle when everything else in life can possibly be open, but I can’t go against my gut.</p></p>

        <p>I feel this. We have to stay strong. They don’t want everyone vaccinated for safety, that I’m sure about.  I don’t understand the plan, but I know I don’t want to be a part of it all.  I’m with you, keep listening to your gut.</p>

        <p>I am leaning more and more toward population control. In a few years there will be miscarriages all over the place and the new 'conspiracy nutjobs' will be linking it to the jab. Calling it.</p>

        <p>I agree with /u/Sindawe, he is 110% correct! If your gut is telling you something is wrong, then something is wrong. Don't ignore it until it passes your litmus test that it is just something else, or a mistake. But do NOT ignore your sixth sense, it was put there for a reason and to ignore it, you do so at your own peril.</p>
<p>Remember, you own your body. You are its steward, manager and tenant, you must maintain it even at the expense of being ridiculed or ostracized because you chose bodily autonomy over drinking the Kool-Aid (RE: Jim Jones).</p>
<p>The moment I felt something was wrong regarding the "pandemic" and researched, and found others like myself doubting that something is not right because of our sixth sense, we turned out to be right, and here we are.</p>

        <p>Dunno! But mark my words. And I don’t mind being proved wrong, because my warnings to folk are for the right reasons.</p>
<p>Maybe not a great answer. There are WAY TOO MANY red flags going on, having looked into Trilateral Commission, Great Reset etc etc. The coercion should be enough for anyone to smell a rat tbh!</p>

        <p>The fact they’re coercing us to take a vaccine made by a company with a 2.3 billion fraud settlement when the who have known vaccine confidence would always be a problem.... says it all.

        <p>Many people want to be wrong, but you can’t deny the truth. I had COVID, and I was sick for three days. Yes, three days. The fever kicked my ass, but I was fine at the second half of day two, felt great at three. People unknowingly blind parallel panicked into the arms of tyranny. I fear for my family members that have fallen for the lie, and offered their arm to the needle. I have a grandmother in law that was quick to take it, and she hasn’t had any adverse reaction, but I’m waiting on the long term side effects. My wife is not taking it, nor her children, and neither am I. Life will go on, vaccine or not, and people only have as much power as you give them over you. Keep your chin up, and do what you deem is best for you. No one can look down on you for taking care of yourself, and your loved ones the best way you know how. Always remain critical of the system, and if you need something to keep your suspicion level at maximum look into the Tuskegee Alabama Syphilis experiments. They claimed the experiment would only last six months, it truly lasted forty years. Keep that in the back of your mind.</p>

This all started may 24 as of now my tremors are pretty well gone not sure if its from the medication or not I only seem to start to   tremor when I'm to physically active. My muscle have twitching still my muscles are quite weak I feel like my legs are going to give out constantly my arms also feel weak. My legs and arms burn and have sharp pain that feels like it's in my bones. Tingling all over. Drooling sluring hard to swallow memory loss  I can be mid conversation and completely forget what I was talking about. I still have random jerks here n there. So far mri ct bloodwork all normal. Evp showed optic neuritis but I've been checked by a specialist and reg eye dr numerous times they say its fine and my eye feels fine now. Believe it or not I'm better than I was but I'm still very unwell. The muscle weakness has basically become constant and it wasn't before it would come n go.</p>

        <p>I had my emg n nerve test done 3 weeks ago haven't heard anything yet from neurologist. It's really frustrating to go from playing baseball and running around with my kids n dogs to basically I need to sit down every 3 mins. I barely make it through standing at the sink to wash a few dishes I hang on the edge of the counter</p>

        <p>Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."</p>
<p>"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are <strong>etc.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c</strong>, and <strong>et cet.</strong> The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. </p>

        <p>Exactly the same. And I’m a rather rational person. I like playing the devils lawyer, as I find it a very good way of separating crap from real. However, this time, I can’t put my finger on exactly what it is, but I just feel it. Like feeling cold or hot - you don’t need to check the room temperature to know how you feel. Weird. But impossible to ignore. I just want time to go by so I finally understand if something’s very wrong or I’m actually just crazy</p>

        <p>That's the best part about this sub, no one WANTS to be right. We all have the same perception of the events unfolding and we all unilaterally hope we're dead wrong, and we're willing to have discussions about it. Compare that with the other side who blindly believes they're right and won't tolerate any contradicting attitudes. (ie. All the bans on pro-vaccine subs for dissenting information)</p>

        <p>Yep. I realised this a while ago (or maybe it was revealed to me), after a period of being very down about the upcoming reality of the uninjected getting persecuted; that it will only get worse for those who submit to the injection, and they will come to bitterly regret it.</p>

<p>I don't believe this is going to be a massive depopulation. But the evidence is out there that it's killing and injuring people. They cannot argue that it's "safe" anymore, only "safer than covid" which is quite debatable. We are not sure on long-term effects of either.</p>

        <p>the Depopulation won't be from the jab directly, (meaning their intention is not to kill you with the jab). It will be from more long term stuff, like a massive drop in the birth rates in a few years.</p>

        <p>If in a year or two from now, there’s no major side effects nor massive birth rate decline i can probably admit i was wrong about being skeptical about the vax.. still wont take it because i already had corona.  </p>
<p>As long as there’s not lingering health issues it’s probably a good thing for most people over 50.  The pressure mounting to get it is whats scary now imo.  </p>
<p>Part of science is to question, to be skeptical.</p>

        <p>This is similar to how I feel... The vaccine risk may be warranted for some if the injuries don't turn out too high... But I will give it another couple years before deciding, I have lots of time before I am over 60 years old so the covid risk is very small to me.</p>

        <p>I agree.  It's not just the data showing the vaccine to be risky and covid overblown; it's also a gut feeling of distrust.</p>
<p>Those in government and media pushing the vaccines now have done a lot to earn our mistrust over the last couple years, lying to our faces about events we can clearly see otherwise ("fiery but peaceful" comes to mind) and essentially nothing honest nor trustworthy in at least a decade.</p>
<p>New drug trials typically take 3-4 years to study long-term effects.  That's how long I'm waiting to decide.  By then covid should be a complete non-issue even to the doomers, so there's a good chance I won't end up taking it at all, but either way it will be a more informed decision.</p>

        <p>I struggle with my gut feeling too.  Something is telling me the whole thing: virus and vaccination feels wrong.  And because I go against the  "new normal" I get judged by my peers, many of who fear being around me...like I'm a leper.  I refuse to get vaccinated.  Never got the flu or pneumonia shot and have been fine.  My biggest fear is that there will be mandatory vaccination.  God help anyone who tries to force me to get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>This shit was obvious from very early on. If everyone that takes the shot dies, it'll be paradise. If everyone that doesn't take the shot dies, hell on Earth.  Either way I would rather die than take the shot. I've made peace with my choice and no longer am anxious.</p>

        <p>I have the same feeling. I took the vax though, so I'm just hoping my decision was correct as I can't "un-vaccinate" myself. The reason I took one initially was because I felt like it would make my life easier now that I was supposedly protected.</p>

<p>"A total of 23 male patients (22 currently serving in the military and 1 retiree; median [range] age, 25 [20-51] years) presented with acute onset of marked chest pain within 4 days after receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. All military members were previously healthy with a high level of fitness. Seven received the BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine and 16 received the mRNA-1273 vaccine. A total of 20 patients had symptom onset following the second dose of an appropriately spaced 2-dose series. All patients had significantly elevated cardiac troponin levels. Among 8 patients who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging within the acute phase of illness, all had findings consistent with the clinical diagnosis of myocarditis. "</p>
