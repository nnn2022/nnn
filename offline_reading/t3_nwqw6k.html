    <strong>Anyone forced to take vaccines notice a decrease in intelligence?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi. As the title says, I have a liberal mother who forced me to take the vaccine. I’m looking for like-minded people to share my experience with looking for insight. I’m only looking for concrete proof, however. I’m not about to spout off some random theory.</p>
<p>I have been tested multiple times for autism as I have a large case of social ineptitude that my mother worries about, throughout my childhood. They said the same thing I thought: I’m just socially inept, I don’t have any other problems.</p>
<p>However, after my recent vaccine appointment I’ve noticed I trail off far more often, and can’t stay on track. Because of this, out of self-interest I got tested again and they said I met criteria on multiple levels for high-functioning autism. I can only assume this is because of common daydreaming and an absence of thoughts.</p>
<p>I have no other reasons in my life to be stressed, as my career has been normal and fine. But the only reason I can think of, is the government trying to numb our minds? The people selling these vaccines could be using it to force their own social change.</p></p>

        <p>As an outsider here, I have noticed some of my vaxxed friends are struggling more mentally. I have to explain things more than I did before, or they are struggling when met with a challenge. A LOT of talk of migraines and headaches coming from them as well. I don’t know what they have going on, so I didn’t want to assume anything, but I have noticed changes.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it seems like things definitely add up to only one reason…if the mRNA is as safe as they claim, there should be nothing to do with the head. It should only change the immune system. I mean things like this have happened before so I would chalk it up to placebo effect, but that is a rare case. How come a lot of people I come across have a story about their friend becoming more “zoned out” (as I’ve heard often described) at times after getting the vaccine? I mean I can’t say officially, but we all know the only reason it’d be this way is the government dumbing people down to accept whatever “new normal” they want.</p>

        <p>I think it has something to do with spike proteins slowly filling the brain and other bodily organs. Also one could wonder about the spiritual here, if the vaxx cuts one off from God or the Source, wouldn't you see the effects of that? Hope this doesn't sound crazy, I may want to go talk to some Christians, even though I am an ex-Christian fundamentalist, but they seem "unplugged" to me.</p>

        <p>I have been very weary of the mRNAs being considered safe after every previous attempt to make such a thing. It always started out looking promising, then unexpected things happened after a few months and they had to stop working on it. It’s never made it out of animal testing before, so I was worried when they bypassed that step. Doesn’t mean it’s the same with this attempt, but it’s why I am holding off. They just don’t know. Also I know this sounds weird, but maybe doing a Keto diet for a few weeks could help?</p>

        <p>Oh you see constant talk of headaches and migraines on Covid Vaccinated and other places. Some have migraines lasting for weeks and days which sounds like hell on earth to me and one of many reasons I'm not lining up. I think the mental effects are very subtle right now. I feel like I can't go too deep or complex with people in general but that could pile up pretty fast.</p>

        <p>I haven't talked about this here, because I thought people would think I am crazy but I have noticed that people I know who took the vaxx seem "slower". I have written posts here that their skin color looks different and I see a glazing on the eyes. I am on the autistic spectrum and have a skill in that I can see patterns and detect subtle differences. People are not the same and it goes beyond PTSD burn out and lock down depressions. There's tons of posts about fatigue and brain fog. I see the symptoms as very akin to chronic fatigue via the autoimmune track, but I wonder about prions. Where are all those spike proteins going? That's what I ask. Also how did your mother "force" you. I don't understand young people today, I would have been fist fighting myway out of the jabbing chair. Why didn't you say no. I would have told you on here time in a youth shelter would be better than having your health permanently ruined even if your mother threatened homelessness on you.</p>

        <p>My mom’s in the medical field and I’m pretty go with the flow so I only offered minor critique at first. I didn’t realize it would be so devastating at the time. But I’ve also noticed something too, it’s like a lot of people are just suddenly okay with being distracted. Not like it was ever rude, but I noticed it happens to a lot of vaccined people way more often.</p>

        <p>You probably didn't know yet, yeah I feel for people on that alone. It took me some time to research and I failed to warn one friend strongly enough when new to looking into it. I am noticing it among the vaccinated too, just distracted. They don't have as much verve to them, there is a muting to them.</p>

        <p>I see energy (believe me or not I don’t care) and I’ve noticed with other vaccines that kids look ‘duller’ after routine shots.  Maybe it’s temporary but it’s like their halo is gone. After I saw that on my son I quit vaccinating him.</p>
<p>My kids know how I feel and I could tell you the day my gran babe was vaccinated because I could see the difference in her energy.  They didn’t tell me but I could see it. </p>
<p>Of course I can’t tell people this (other than a few who also are in tune) so when you say you see things on people I totally believe you.</p>

        <p>Hey I believe you. I support some vaccines, but think all medicine has side effects and probably knocks people down a bit. You may think I am nuts too, but I more feel then see things, and have had people consider me "intuitive" in secular circles--I am not a physical medium or anything like that as far as I know, but have known things that surprised people,  or "discerning" in past Christian circles. With the vaxxed, my mind is reading them as "Grey". Some New Agers who believe in auras, probably would say the aura has been removed or blurred out. I may try and find a spiritual group even of Christians and others to talk about this stuff with. I think we are to be compassionate to all souls, vaxxed or not of course.</p>

        <p>Covid vaccene is known to cause vascular issues. Vascular issues can affect all parts of the body as it reduces blood flow. Still lots to be learned about the effects and if cognitive decline is one of them as its hard to measure unless it's a steep decline and lots of external factors can contribute to it. However anecdotally I have noticed something a bit "off" with a few friends being able to grasp complex tasks that have received the vaccene in the recent past. Simple linear algebra tasks are taking them forever to grasp and making lots of mistakes that they didn't make before. I'm assumimg it's just the result of lack of social situations making their minds numb but you never know. The Netflix and chill life will numb your mind we are not designed for social isolation</p>

        <p>I know it's hard to figure out what are cognitive effects from social isolation. I woke up this morning thinking, I have nothing to dream about, which is weird, like the lack of stimulation is bothering me, but I am doing art work and writing so brain is being put to use. Cognitive decline can be gradual, people won't even notice at first but if you are picking up things with friends and more, that's a concern. I have noticed people seem like they are checking out and seem more "robotic" like no emotions. There again that could PTSD stuff but I don't know. If they can't do algebra that is seriously concerning, if they could do it before, we are talking some Flowers for Algernon shit right there. I used to have disturbing thoughts about that book, that were life long. :/</p>

        <p>Older guy that builds transmissions at the shop I work at has gotten increasingly slower and fucks up more often now.

        <p>Well it can effect the neurological system.  We know a person with pretty severe GB type of symptoms from the ‘vaccine’. He’s undergoing PT and other treatments and told us his MD said 1/39000 are experiencing this, many more severe, said something about 30 year olds being in nursing homes relearning to walk etc.</p>

        <p>These past couple years I have heard people talking about brain fog so much. I'm really not clear on what it encompasses exactly but apparently lots of people have it🤷‍♀️ Initially I heard it in regards to people who had been living in homes with mold and then it moved onto "long term covid" effects and vaccines.</p>

        <p>I’ve had many health problems since I was a teenager - major digestive issues, severe depression, poor circulation, etc. Brain fog started a few years ago. I’ve always been very intelligent and have a successful career but I noticed that I was having a hard time focusing, I was making a LOT of stupid mistakes at work and my memory was terrible. I would have to ask people to explain things to me dozens of times because I couldn’t remember. One time I found a friend’s wedding invitation on top of my fridge and I panicked because I couldn’t remember if I had attended or not. Anyway, I was a mess and terrified. Luckily I discovered “earthing” and my health problems are all slowly but steadily improving. I highly recommend that anyone struggling starts to electrically connect to the earth, as crazy as it sounds. Mother Earth will heal you.</p>
