    <strong>the Single Deadliest Plague in Human History, and yet......</strong>
    <p><p>$286 Billion on a $900 Billion bill that's handcuffed to a $1.4 Trillion dollar spending package. </p>
<p>Why are we sending billions of American tax dollars abroad when we have our own people out of work from lockdowns, our own crumbling infrastructure, our own homeless veterans, our own issues with drug and substance abuse?</p>
<p>They didn't even fix the water in Flint until... ever....it's still fucked up. Since 2014. That like 7 generations of iphone. Rust belt cities are falling apart. Parts of Appalachia are like a 3rd world country. Did fentanyl dissappear with the lockdowns?  </p>
<p>But we can stuff a relief bill - a bill to combat a global crisis; a crisis that's dominated every  single facet of America life for a year - with billions of American tax dollars appropriated to foriegn countries and special interests.</p>
<p>As we supposedly begin to near the end of our corona fueled nightmare, we're now being told that the next big issue after the pandemic, after they reopen the economy, is the looming mental health crisis facing millions of Americans who lost jobs, lost contact with loved ones, who face depression or drug use or alcoholism. Elderly in assisted living who aren't allowed to see their loved ones for what might be their last Christmas. Where's the money coming from to address that?  </p>
<p>How does any of this make sense?  </p>
<p>What has Congress been doing since March? What have these hospitals been doing all this time, that we "need" to be locked down again?   </p>
<p>We see spikes in flu and cold hospitalizations this time every year, but when given 9 months to nationally prepare we all of a sudden are "running out of beds across the country".  </p>
<p>Except flu cases are down 90% because we're social distancing. Except it only stopped the flu not coronavirus space aids.  </p>
<p>Maybe if people would have  #just.worn.a.mask.sweaty.full.stop    </p>
<p>They'd have you believe bodies are piling up in the streets because rabid anti-masker Raider Gangs are running rampant through the wastelands, coughing on grandma and having family Christmas dinners    </p>
<p>Guys, it's literally Mad Max meets The Walking Dead meets Contagion!    </p>
<p>Give me a break   </p>
<p>We're told everyday that this is the single biggest issue facing our country.     </p>
<p>We were told that we needed to kill our economy just to keep our morgues from being overwhelmed.    </p>
<p>We were told all of this, but yet we have enough time to budget billions in aid to foriegn countries but not enough time to address our domestic issues? Like, if we don't get that money out to the Sudanese ASAP, then we'll never be able to help vets or small businesses?  </p>
<p>Covid didn't make that other stuff disapear. And the lockdowns made a lot of it worse.    </p>
<p>If things are so dire, how are we taking the time in the midst of this "crisis" to carve out a slice of the pie for all these other places and special interests halfway across the world when we have our own problems here? If covid is such a pressing issue why did we have to tie relief to all this other pork?  </p>
<p>I guess they think that $600 of our own tax dollars to combat an issue THE GOVERNMENT caused is better than nothing. They're all but telling us that we better take our hush money and be damn grateful for it too.  </p>
<p>Why was it so critical for the gov't to force some guy with two mortages to close his company for a year, to stave off a virus with a 99% survival rate, but when the time comes to help him out, our priority is sending his tax dollars across the ocean? Fuck him, Pakistan need election reform and gender equality right now!  </p>
<p>500 people can crowd into a walmart or target but the family restaurant down the block can't seat more than 10 people inside or serve after 10pm.  </p>
<p>But don't worry mom &amp; pop, Egypt is getting a billion dollars.</p></p>

        <p>Ask the people who keep voting Democrat.  They held onto the bill and refused to sign it for months until they got every spending option they wanted.  I'd be very interested to hear how the democratic voters who are out of work would defend this.</p>

        <p>They only complain.  About Trump.  Everything comes back to Trump, and that’s all they’ve done is complain about him since November of ‘16.  Because he wasn’t their glorious Obama, who was out of time, and their chosen successor, Clinton, could not be elected.</p>
<p>Always Trump.  It’s all his fault /s</p>

        <p>Exacrly what i thought when I saw all that money going to all these random countries. Im sure Americans are SO happy that places like Egypt, Pakistan, and Israel are getting THEIR money while they are struggling. But hey they get 600 back!</p>

        <p>No. It makes NO sense. Any of it. </p>
<p>What would you do if you were running a corporation that you could bail from with a golden parachute right before it goes bankrupt? Spend corporate money like a drunken sailor, of course. No ramifications to worry about if you don't have to pay it back. </p>

        <p>I'm guessing they held us hostage so they can get as many special interest payoffs as they could, while giving the American people peanuts. We don't need to build woman's and latino museums  or finance arabian gender studies. Bullshit like that has to be congress somehow funnelling money into their own pockets.</p>
