    <strong>Anyone else instructed to ‚Äúnot talk about this‚Äù?</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôve have been told over and over that I‚Äôm wrong about this from everyone I know: there is no conspiracy, the vaccines will open things up, we all need masks on everywhere, it‚Äôs too deadly and scary out there, etc.</p>
<p>I have also been told I better not talk about C19 with others. </p>
<p>They shut me down declaring that I‚Äôm wrong, misinformed and I‚Äôm part of the problem because I hate mask mandates.</p>
<p>So since I‚Äôm of a different mindset, I am just expected to keep my mouth shut on anything and everything Covid.  Every issue from CDC changing rules, hypocrisy, death of small business, wrongful arrests, to suicides - I am expected to avoid talking about it all.</p>
<p>As this scamdemic keeps pressing on, I keep on thinking and finding out more.
I want to talk about this to others, express myself, point out problems, ask why they think as they do.
But I can‚Äôt.</p>
<p>Am I allowed to want to drop people that want me to be silent?</p></p>

<p>Absolutely you are, and for your own sanity, you might have to</p>
<p>Back at the beginning I was sharing my opinion and articles, research and video with others - I had members of my family 'don't want to hear this' so I would ease off a bit</p>
<p>It got to the point I felt so down even trying that I eased off, but somewhere between then and now <em>something</em> has clicked for most of them... I'm not arrogant enough to think it was all my doing but I know some of the seeds I set bore some fruit</p>
<p>I'm at the point now where I find it almost physically painful trying to reason with those who just are stuck in the msm hivemind, and people I never thought I couldn't be without I've been able to leave behind</p>
<p>If anything, this has shown me who the dangerous people are - and imo, the people willingly going along with this to the point where they snoop and snitch on others are FAR more of a threat to everyone than those implementing the measures ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

        <p>Sadly I‚Äôve learned through this that you categorically will not get through to these people. There‚Äôs something blocking the common sense and logic part of their brain. All the lies, the inconsistencies, the hypocrisy, the blatant biased media, the censorship, the propaganda, the list goes on. It would have to take a complete brainwashed fool not to be able to see it and unfortunately that‚Äôs the majority. You can judge straight away these kinds of people, when they all repeat the same shit, ‚Äòstay safe‚Äô, ‚Äòwe‚Äôre all in the same boat‚Äô ‚Äòwe just need to follow the rules‚Äô ‚ÄòSomeone yesterday wasn‚Äôt social distancing‚Äô etc etc </p>
<p>I know it‚Äôs defeatist but I don‚Äôt even bother anymore. I try and change the subject at every opportunity. It‚Äôs just not worth your energy and sanity.</p>
