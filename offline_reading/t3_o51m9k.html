        <p>I'm so sorry about your grandmom. </p>
<p>My mom started having a hard time breathing and coughing a lot a little under a week after dose 2 of pfizer. At about 2.5 weeks she finally said I need to go to the doctor. Her oxygen was low, hanging between 88 and 92 frequently.  At the ER and when she was admitted to the hospital (different location, same network) they all dismissed it could be related to the vaccine. She had no previous breathing difficulties excluding bronchitis a few years ago. They offered no explanation for what was causing this sudden problem, just insisted it couldn't be the vaccine. Her discharge papers say something about seasonal allergies, no mention of being post vaccinationðŸ™„ Apparently she suddenly developed allergies that require supplemental oxygen, breathing treatments and iv steroids. </p>
<p>I didn't trust the vaccine before but I didn't realize just how far they were going to hide dangerous reactions. It's absolutely insane.</p>

        <p>yup, when anyone dies after being around covid, its a covid death. when a healthy person dies the day after a vaccine, it canâ€™t be related to the vaccine. science</p>

        <p>A friend of mine got her face densely covered by pimples about 3 weeks after the second shot. She's in her late 30's, sexually active and never had so many pimples even as a teenager. No changes in diet, exercise or any other circumstance that could be linked.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear about your grandmother. I dont know anyone personally who has died from it but I have seen some of the other effects. One of my neighbors got Bells Palsy. Another person I know got severe nerve damage one one side of her body, now has to walk with a cane and attends physical therapy. Another had some type of reaction mixed with her preexisting conditions landed her in the ICU for a week, didnt think it had anything to do with the vaccine, got the 2nd dose, landed in the hospital again, she's out now but is still to ill to return to work.</p>
<p>I agree that the bad reactions are being downplayed and even sensored. If I didn't see some of these reactions first hand I don't know if I would have looked as deeply at the reports. I just have a very bad feeling about this.</p>

        <p>Thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t believe their numbers. I know of two people who died after getting their second letale injection. One died in her 40s after a brain aneurysm, another one in his 30s suddenly collapsed and died of heart failure.</p>

        <p>Wow ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³Iâ€™m sorry to hear that. 
See, this is why I donâ€™t trust them: almost everyone I have spoken to knows at least one or more people who died or had serious effects from the vaccine. They say that these bad effects are 1 in 1 million. It doesnâ€™t add up. Statistically speaking, that means that myself and each of my friends would have to personally know about 1 million people on average, which isnâ€™t possible.</p>

        <p>My sister got it. Spent the next day puking. You know, like any other vaccine. Her company made her get it even though she had the antibodies.</p>
<p>Her boyfriend got it. Had a fever of 103 and was sick for 2 days. You know, like any other vaccine.</p>
<p>One of my band mates got it. We were supposed to meet up to write music but he was sick for 3 days. You know, like any other vaccine.</p>
<p>A guy who hosted concerts at my university said he passed out and slept for 12 hours when he got home. He cancelled his plans when getting his second dose since that one is supposed to be worse. You know, like any other vaccine.</p>
<p>My coworker's friend's 100 year old grandma may have died from covid though so I guess I better line up for the unapproved mystery goo.</p>
