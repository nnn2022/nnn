    <strong>Who Really Knows?</strong>
    <p><p>So I've been reading articles, hearing testimonies, and contemplating what the right response to today's happenings should be; on a personal level, as well as on a community level.  As many issues are so current and new information is constantly being discovered, it makes it difficult for me to take a firm stance.</p>
<p>There are so many factors that I can weigh in, and I am constantly learning.   </p>
<p>I've been diligent to not allow myself to become set in my ways of thought, for a couple reasons.  For one, in my experience, when I develop a strong belief in an ideal, it tends to become more difficult to listen to an opposing viewpoint.  Even if there is new information that I've yet to become exposed to, I find myself dismissing this information as false, before taking an objective look at it.  </p>
<p>Also, in my experience, having a strong connection to potentially polarizing beliefs has effected relationships with those who I disagree with.  At best, it may be a mutual feeling of sympathy for one another, as the both of use believe the other has been lead astray, and this may cause us to have a difficult time taking the other's perspective into genuine consideration.  At worst, it may cause myself and the other person/s to view the other camp as the "enemy".  I've seen this happen in my own experience, and in others lives, and it is sad to say the least.</p>
<p>So I tend to try to see both sides, stay in my own lane, focusing on self improvement, and listening and respecting the opinion of my peers.  </p>
<p>For most of my life, this has worked beautifully, and I've maintained close relationships with people of many varying opinions.  However, recently this has become far easier said than done.  </p>
<p>In recent times, this neutrality seems to frustrate  friends, family, co-workers, or anyone who I have conversations about sensitive topics with.  </p>
<p>It makes you into a difficult person to label, and causes others to be uncomfortable with you. </p>
<p>I think this is because when you have a strong belief in a polarizing issue, two things happen:</p>
<p>Those in support feel they can accept you, and enjoy having another member on their team.  </p>
<p>Those who disagree will be able to disregard you as another one of the opposition, and have premeditated points they are able to use as ammunition if they'd like to argue against your viewpoint.</p>
<p>When you choose to admit that you simply do not know the right answers, people will immediately assume you are ignorant.  They'll either attempt to convert you to their belief, or dismiss you.</p>
<p>But, if you converse with them and they are able to see you actually NOT ignorant, this is where things get interesting.  Usually, I can admit and recall evidence of substantial supporting evidence for two opposing ideals that CONTRADICT each other.  </p>
<p>In most situations as I mention earlier, I tend to go with a passive action, until I can decide that enough evidence has been collected to make a rational decision.</p>
<p>However, the current sentiment is "silence is violence"  which in many cases means  "lack of action is worse than taking action prematurely"</p>
<p>I am becoming increasingly worried about this.  I am choosing to post this without bringing up specific events, because I'd love for this to be looked at without bias, as no more than my contribution to a society that I can see is hurting.  A world that is hurting itself without realizing it.  </p>
<p>Let's respect ourselves enough to be ok with not jumping into one camp or another.  Be humble enough to admit when you aren't 100% sure!  Listen to both sides, not just to RESPOND, but to LEARN. Much love to everyone, no matter what your beliefs are, I wish you all the best, and I'd love to discuss anything on your minds.  Peace.</p></p>

        <p>I had a bit of a similar stance to what you describe. But recently I have, probably due to similar reasons of what you mentioned, slightly adjusted what I do.</p>
<p>Let me try and describe how.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that my apparent neutrality wasn't how I actually felt about topics. There usually always still was a bias the one way or the other.</p>
<p>And I think that as long as the bias doesn't become a dogma that makes you avoid information from the other side of the spectrum, this doesn't become a problem.</p>
<p>I think that people "from the other side" enjoy discussions with someone who has a different bias but isn't dogmatic about it. Much more so than someone who claims neutrality but actually isn't.</p>
<p>A probable reason for that is that this doesn't seem authentic. And authenticity may have a massive impact on others perception of yourself. If you say something that you don't really believe in yourself, you are perceived as dishonest or even a liar. People subconsciously can sense that.</p>
<p>There's enough linguistic tools to express that you are not dogmatic about your biases. For example making plenty use of phrases like "I think", "In my opinion", "According to my information", "From what I've heard", "In my experience", etc.<br>
Also making sure to separate between observation, thought and emotion when you talk.</p>
<p>And you can still ask questions out of curiosity to learn something about the other view and potentially reevaluate your own if the input is particularly inspiring.</p>
<p>tl;dr:</p>
<p>Having biases doesn't mean you can't have an open-mind. Just recognize those biases as biases and don't let them become a dogma.</p>

        <p>This is great advice, and something I hadn’t considered was when trying to maintain neutrality when I do in fact have biases is actually unauthentic and may be contributing to a negative perception someone may have of my forced neutral stance.</p>

        <p>I think you’re right in that if someone is able to have a mature conversation, they’ll be able to recognize that just because I do lean toward disagreement, doesn’t mean we can’t have a discussion.  And then we can proceed with said discussion without me feeling as though I need to avoid taking a stance.  </p>
<p>If the discussion can’t be had without avoiding taking a position, it would not have been a worthwhile conversation to have anyway.  </p>
<p>Thanks very much</p>
