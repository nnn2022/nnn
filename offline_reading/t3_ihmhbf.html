        <p>I've been more brave lately with going maskless and have only gotten one comment so far. Was at Starbucks the other day and went to and from the bathroom and as I got to my seat, one of the baristas told me I need to wear a mask when standing. Was real polite about it. But so far no one else really seems to care.</p>

        <p>Yeah the mandate here in NYS is that if you're in a restaurant you don't have to wear one when sitting at a table but you need to wear one when standing or walking. I don't agree with it of course but I just gave him a polite "k thanks" and sat back down. Not gonna start anything with someone forced to repeat that nonsense. </p>
<p>It's funny cause at the Starbucks that I normally frequent, they don't give a shit if you wear a mask. I've seen a couple people order without one and they say nothing. I guess it really does depend on where you go.</p>

        <p>Ya, I wouldn‚Äôt argue with them it‚Äôs just fascinating to me the ones who agree to tell people those things for the job they have. I usually don‚Äôt say anything but once I wanted to cry when the lady who was in her last trimester behind the counter at pet smart was wearing her mask. I could hardly breathe in my last trimester with each of my kids just from them in my ribs and pushing on things and I had bad sinus problems during pregnancy so it was always a pain to breathe. It just made me want to shake her to take the damn thing off.</p>

        <p>I'm done being nice to maskers, they have a lot of blood on their hands by complying with these mandates. Anytime a business ~~asks~~ tells me to put on a mask I educate them on the dangers. My hands are clean, they need to be made aware of the damage they are doing.</p>
<p>After educating them and sharing some references I just leave, they do not deserve my business.</p>
<p>I have a medical condition, if I wear a mask even for a minute I will faint and hit the ground hard. No, I don't have to tell anyone what that condition is.</p>

        <p>This article is so one sided. It never mentions the people who become violent towards peaceful people who aren‚Äôt wearing masks. This whole fucked up year has really helped me to see how manipulative the mainstream media is.</p>

        <p>The masks are permanent, forever.</p>
<p>A vaccine doesn't stop it. The goalposts will shift to "it's not 100% effective" and "some people can't get it so you have to keep masking" plus the usual anti-vaxxer "you can't inject MY body!".</p>
<p>Politics doesn't stop it. It's always going to be "safer" to keep them. The people enacting the rules never actually suffer them. No transit authority ever has any reason to remove the mask dictate, forever. Schools, trains, airlines, retail stores - all of these are permanently stuck with the face diapers forever. Just like every bit of post-9/11 security bullshit and every post-shooting school metal detector is forever.</p>
<p>Covid ending doesn't stop it. The narrative will change to "we did masks in 2020 for Covid, we can do them in 2021 for flu! And 2025! And 2099! ... " Forever. There are too many people too happy sitting at home smug about forcing everyone else into masks. This is democracy, if 51% of people want masks forever, the other 49% are fucked forever.</p>
<p>The interesting cases will be places like sports stadiums and movie theaters, which have a real incentive to get the masks off to sell food and drink. My guess here is that you will have to show your properly updated Vaccination Card to enter such a place.</p>
