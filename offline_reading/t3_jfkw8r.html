    <strong>Has anyone noticed that women are way more likely not to fall for this scamdemic?</strong>
    <p><p>This subreddit seems to have the biggest amount of women compared to most other subreddits.I have maybe seen 1-2 guys without a mask since they were enforced. Meanwhile in a single day I counted 5 women without masks.</p>
<p>Most of them are of "immigrant" ethnicity, but woman generally seem way more rebellious.Think about how most protests, It's always woman who are the majority.Iran Protests, Whiterussia protests, Feminist protests (These are huge), Climate change protests</p>
<p>Etc, often these in third world country's can be extremely hostile, even for men, yet woman seem much more likely to take risks.</p>
<p>I know very few guys who aren't pro restrictions. Yet most women I have spoken too resent these restrictions.</p>
<p>Sorry this is post was not meant to be seens as simp post. Just extremely difficult not to instantly fall in love with a beautiful girl not wearing mask in the train.</p>
<p>And honestly, we need genders in this fight, and we need men to man up again!!!</p></p>

        <p>My observation is the opposite. It’s mostly women I see muzzled and the men aren’t. 
Now are they wearing it coz they believe all this BS or they are a rule followers, I have no idea.</p>

        <p>I haven’t seen a big gender divide, but I’m a lady and I’ve been against this BS from day 1. </p>
<p>Apparently polls show that women care more about the pandemic and have higher mask compliance than men, and that “toxic masculinity” is behind all the selfish maskless ness. And that further in the US, Trump is on track to “lose bigly” with suburban women and women in general. I dunno who’s right and who’s lying. But I’m an outspoken, unmasked female!</p>

        <p>Wtf is wrong with you? I’m a stay at home homeschooling mom and I’m not having any of this shit. Anyone pushing for lockdowns and masks can shove those masks right up their asses along with their heads, and people like you need to get down off your goddamn high horse because you’re just as bad and self righteous as they are. Mask wearers hate anyone who isn’t the same as them and so do you. </p>
<p>And we leave our homes all the time and have plenty of things we want to do - you’d know that if you got to know anyone who isn’t like you.</p>

        <p>Most groups of people aren’t inherently evil. Even ones that make bad decisions. And suburban women are getting sick of hAving no careers because of school closures. We shall see how things will shake out.</p>

        <p>Woman here, a lot of women see how this all disproportionally affects them. Many women my age were forced to quit their careers and stay home with kids to virtually school. Some 80% of the laid off workforce were women. Women who are still working from home are now working, taking care of kids and playing teacher. </p>
<p>Women are getting the short end of this stick big time and continued restrictions may change our community for a long time and lower many women’s chances at a life where they can have a career and be a parent at the same time.</p>
<p>Edit to add: A lot of working and lower class women see this. Other women I know who basically live off of their partner are content to stay home and coddle their increasingly mentally unstable kids as they drive the panic and fear on Facebook.</p>

        <p>Out of the couples that I know, mostly the husbands are the doomers while the wives are realistic and want their children to have normal lives.  One woman I know actually called her husband a coward because he refuses to leave the house while she is actually working at a nursing home and she has to do all the grocery shopping while also going to work.</p>
<p>I only know one couple where the wife is a doomer and the husband is not, she made him stay in a hotel for a week when we came home from visiting his family in another state.</p>

        <p>I wish I could say this but I’ve noticed it’s mostly women in my area who are complying. We should be against this the most when women are disproportionately affected by the lockdowns but I guess a lot value social approval more than anything</p>

        <p>I live in Yavapai County, AZ. I don't seea gender difference. I see a difference in economic class. The working class that doesn't work for home is largely opposed to the nonsense here regardless of political affiliation - doesn't matter if they like Trump, Green Party, socialism, whatever. (I know a Trump supporter who likes masks - she works only from home.)</p>

        <p>Yeah I haven’t noticed too much of a gender difference, either. </p>
<p>But a huge difference between those who have been working outside their homes this whole time and those who have been working from home. The people who have been out and about number one, CAN’T be afraid of going outside because they have to. And number two, see the real world functioning on a daily basis and that people aren’t dying all over the place.</p>
<p>People who have been holed up this whole time haven’t engaged with the real world in a while and the teevee tells them it’s still rill scary out there.</p>

        <p>I’m a woman.</p>
<p>I feel like based on my Facebook friends and the comments I see from women I don’t know when browsing news stories, that the women are the most scared, blaming others for not wearing masks so we can end this, and supportive of restrictions. They’re of the “it’s Trump’s fault” and “if it saves one life” mindset, and they also don’t seem to support reopening unless it goes “slowly.” (I don’t know how much slower we can go.) They’re the ones sharing stories about CASES and SURGES, sharing pro-mask posts and being emotional about the virus. (“I wear a mask for...” type of comments about their immune compromised relatives.) </p>
<p>The men I know generally don’t even post about COVID and don’t seem half as worried.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't notice any correlation with gender.  I know just as many male shithead doomers as I do female shithead doomers</p>
<p>Is it possible that women are simply more comfortable revealing their gender in skeptic subs versus default/popular subs?  Most of reddit is full of 13-year-old, developmentally-retarded incel trash, who have a fucking aneurysm any time there's a womang on the interwebz, whereas these subs attract people who are actually relatively normal, compassionate and socially competent.</p>

        <p>I see mostly women masking up. But I have to say that with women it is more extreme when they are against. They will be way more based when not masking up.</p>
<p>I think women in general are more comformist in general but when they are not conformist their opinion is much stronger.</p>
<p>My mom is extremely against everything. First day of the pandemic she made up her last will and laughed about it.</p>
