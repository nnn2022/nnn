    <strong>I’m so sick of the regurgitation of newsspeak surrounding Covid</strong>
    <p><p>My parents are a weird mix. They are divorced, one staunch Trump supporter (dad) and one staunch Democrat (mom) yet they both spew the same lines from CNN and other news stations about the vaccines and percentages that mean nothing without actual numbers. ‘Well 99% of people getting it now are unvaccinated’ ok dad SOURCE? ‘Honey, you can still get it even if you’ve already had it’ ok mom and so can vaccinated individuals…. 
I’m so fucking sick of it. My fiancé and I will not be injected with mRNA , we both have natural immunity (got Covid early 2020) and have tested this out in the real world after partying and drinking around folks who were confirmed cases in early 2021. We just got back from a large concert in Florida of all places and it’s like our family members on both sides think we are absolutely insane and reckless. I have a cousin who is going to be fired from her job for refusing the shot , she also had Covid so she has NATURAL IMMUNITY. Doomers like both of our parents like to spew that natural immunity doesn’t last as long. How do they know? They don’t. Yet we have actual real life testimony of natural immunity lasting over a year. My dad is all up in arms about how my cousin could loose this 70k a year job she’s been at (she’s a dietician) for over 12 years because she’s refusing the shot.  Again she has had Covid and still has antibodies….. what happened to basic knowledge of biology and the immune system? I’m at my wits end dealing with these people and they happen to be some of the same people I love more than anything. WHEN DOES IT END THIS IS SO FUCKING AGGRAVATING</p></p>

        <p>I found out how they get the 99% figure. They take all of the cases of covid, from the very start (so even before vaccines were available) and that way they have 99% of people who got covid were unvaccinated. </p>
<p>The use of statistics in the media has been a joke right from the start.  </p>
<p>Stay Strong. This too will pass</p>

        <p>Im guessing you’re young…? GOOD FOR YOU!!!  For using your brain on this. Stay the hell away from that poison. Nothing beats natural immunity and God only knows what the hell will come out of this human experiment. I too am sick of the lies on the news for almost 2 years straight now about this virus. Stay strong.</p>

        <p>I really appreciate the support, this sub is the only thing that keeps me sane sometimes! Wouldn’t consider myself young anymore but in my 30’s and could be living my best life if the media would stop indoctrinating all of my loved ones</p>
