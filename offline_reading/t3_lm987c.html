        <p>i'd say it is more trying to prevent division + my personal experience, that there can't be a powerful and loving god.</p>
<p>but whatever.</p>
<p>it certainly isn't something to focus on, but rather that we need to unite against the kakistocracy to protect that spark, that spirit, that god connection, whatever the fuck  in our children and us, because they want it gone. they want your mind destroyed and your connections broken and you being changed to who knows what.</p>

        <p>The r/coronavirus daily discussion threads are almost like r/lockdownskepticism nowadays. I go there just to read that thread. It's full of people who are tired of this crap and actually want us to go back to normal ASAP. The real hysterical doomers actually get downvoted now. It's been interesting to see that sub's near 180° turn in the past couple months. Their other threads are hit or miss though, some of those are still full of doom.</p>

        <p>Here they made a new publicity about obesity. In it the woman struggle to keep a healthy weight and in the end she's easily 400+ pounds and she doesn't know what to do anymore.
So the doctor (a well known actress here) tells her that it is not her fault as everytime she loses weight her body (as if it's a different entity) automatically do everything in it's power to gain all the weight back and so the solution is : Take these pills combined with a healthy diet and exercices routine...</p>
<p>Like WTF ! I would never ever put someone who's overweight down as they are human beings worthy of respect and dignity just like everybody else but telling people that they have no power over themselves doesn't help at all...</p>
<p>As a health worker i am shocked over that misinformations. There's definitely people who gain weight more easily than others but there's no calorie in the air...That "obese gene" doesn't seem to exist outside countries where people overeat and are sedentary.1+1=2.</p>
<p>Reaching such dangerous weight is clearly a sign of disordered eating or an eating disorder (the opposite is restrictive ED,anorexia) and these people need help to heal their bodies but also their minds. It is their struggle and being confined and that doesn't help them,for them their drug is food while others it's alcohol or whatever.</p>
<p>Since the beginning i tell my patients that they need to build a stronger immune system but the governement do everything in it's power to keep them in such state (more vulnerable=more cases and more deaths) and now they want to sell them useless pills that are gonna act as a placebo because the weight loss will be due to the diet and exercices.</p>
<p>I love people regardless of their weight and i want the best for them so i won't glorify obesity and make them believe that they have no power because they do !</p>

        <p>I just don’t understand how we are being told to take vaccines and “stay home” to be “healthy” but there is absolutely no air for combatting obesity, poor diets, poor exercise, and how over consumption of alcohol/drugs damages your immune system. </p>
<p>I mean I’m all for letting people be “free birds” and letting them do as they please but the meme is simply pointing out how shitty the MsM “healthcare” rhetoric has become.</p>

        <p>&rt; Reaching such dangerous weight is clearly a sign of disordered eating</p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p>However, disordered eating is what the government, the food industry, and the medical community are all pushing. Their advice and products are precisely what is making people fat. </p>
<p>This idea that it's gluttony and sloth doesn't pass the laugh test. Go look at pictures of crowds from 1950. Spot the fat people. There aren't any. </p>
<p>Did gluttony and sloth only come into existence in the 70s and late 60s? </p>
<p>No. We are in the middle of history's biggest mass poisoning, and the popular consensus is that it is somehow the victims' fault.</p>

        <p>This may end up sounding slightly condescending however this was the case for awhile (not at mega obese levels but +40 lbs) but I Think what we eat and how we eat are contributing to this yo-yo effect we see in obese people and I simply want to say in some cases they aren't as responsible as people make them out to be (sometimes lol) Allow me to explain. </p>
<p>First, the weight loss nutrition ethos has pushed some bad shit into this world, first IIFYM is garbage - food quality matters. Second using calorie reduction only works if the body is metabolically healthy &amp; starvation mode hasn't been triggered (kind of a nebulous term since it isn't a light switch). Really fat people their bodies are actually trapped in starvation mode because they become insulin resistant yet also need all of those calories to get the body to think it has satisfied its requirements (combination of sugar and industrial seed oils are to blame). Also eating many tiny meals throughout the day is also garbage advice. </p>
<p>You will get the common scenario where overweight person counts calories to lose weight - they have success for awhile, however the body goes deeper into lock-down mode and eventually the cravings are overpowering - they cheat and they snap back to where they were if not more quicker than they lost it when it took them  much longer to gain it the first time. What happened was is the bodies default state never reset from the old weight - the body has a homeostatis is it trying to maintain and if something isn't done to reset it one can spend years going from 300+ to 1xx and go right back double quick. </p>
<p>This is where a combination of low carb and different fasting strategies come into play. First off if one wants to create a caloric deficit, the easiest way is to cut carbs. if one tries to cut by decreasing everything well the body is going to resist letting go of its stores more and more.... The body does not NEED carbs, it can produce glycogen through converting protein via gluconeogenesis and processing fatty acids through the liver. (and or make ketones depending on meal timing and carb and protein intake) That process is more efficient as far as insulin requirements go and burning calories through the thermogenic effect of food than it is to convert carbs. </p>
<p>Me personally I am an advocate of using keto or even better using carnivore approach in order to reset the body from being obese - however reduced carbs (lets say ~100g/day) may be acceptable if physical expenditure is high - the goal is keep insulin levels as flat as possible for as long as possible and get A1C to get as low as possible because that is the reset.  I would also say when cutting calories it shouldn't be calculated as per day or per week thing but possibly over several weeks or or even months. Some days it is absolutely beneficial to go HAM - others you can go easily 2 or 3 days and eat very little - one would work this around their life and exercise but the idea is having a big calorie day will keep the body primed for several days afterwards even when calories aren't coming in (it will burn off stored calories). Traditional calorie restriction usually doesn't factor this in and just has every day at the same level.... humans are not robots. </p>
<p>Sorry this shit is long - I just feel passionate about his because I once was overweight and legitimately had eating disorders - I would try to lose weight through restriction - would feel like garbage, get hungry and blow everything up while still feeling like garbage even when i ate clean. Metabolically and hormonaly I was always shut down because I was afraid of fat and eating too much. (also bulimia had its say) but now I am at a place where I don't really have to think about quantity of what I am eating because my body tells me when I have had enough now.... not only that I was an alcoholic and smoked cigarettes, going keto/carnivore for a year actually made it so those cravings completely went away and have not returned.... it took me a long time to get to this place mostly because I had to figure this stuff out on my own - if I were given some sort of cookie cutter nutritional plan to lose weight I am sure as hell I would have failed.</p>

        <p>Dude that’s awesome, good for you. It sucks living in a time where they’re trying to tell us to be healthy by staying inside and while giving us the worst health through low grade fast food and cheap production. </p>
<p>And honestly I could give a crap if someone is overweight or not - the meme simply points to how we have poor health in society and the energy that’s being put into these vaccines and masks are the last thing to save you from dying.</p>

        <p>I despise fat people like anyone else but their presence exist along both sides of the mask debate. I thought this country was fat when I was a kid buts its only gotten worse. Argue all you want about the hypocrisy of quarantine followers, social distancers, and maskers. And their concern about the national "health" but some of the anti-maskers could take a word of their own advice and get out of the house more.</p>
