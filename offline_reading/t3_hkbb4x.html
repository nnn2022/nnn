<title>From a witch/craft perspective. From practicing lesser magick, I can tell you that FEAR is the weakest, most novice spell you can use. It's effective, though it requires the feds to KEEP HAMMERING you with covid-porn to keep in belief state. It only works on the weak. This why its SOOOO repetitive</title>

    <p><p>This is how the media psyop works. </p>
<p>In advertising, the 7 exposure rule is necessary just to get the audience attention. Once they have your attention, they have to start positioning in your mind the NEW THING ( novel), with an emotion. </p>
<p>The emotion of caution wasnt enough. They needed to associate a few words and phrases with covid so that you will PERMANENTLY associate it (covid-19/coronavirus) with the worst case scenario.  This is why I believe either the doomer posts are agents or some type of crisis actors when they keep dropping these buzzwords. </p>
<p>We are all familiar with the buzzes. I have omitted most of the slogans to focus on particular subliminal translations. I have organized them in an input:output format. </p>
<p>&rt;1. Ventilator : This is thing you will be breathing out of if you dont follow orders</p>
<p>&rt;2. The vulnerable: your family is as good as dead if you dont follow our orders. (Italian crisis actors literally live streamed in front of dead family members)</p>
<p>&rt;3. HIV: Even if you have never used needles or had unprotected sex, you are still susceptible to such a disease. Your immune system cant help you. </p>
<p>&rt;4. So much we dont know: Even if you recover, you  will still suffer</p>
<p>&rt;5. Mask: the only way to survive. Those who don't wear them will kill you</p>
<p>&rt;6. Social Distancing: People who are close to you are dangerous </p>
<p>&rt;7. New Normal: This disease is a permanent threat</p>
<p>&rt;8. uncertain times: you may not survive this </p>
<p>&rt;9. Deaths: The disease has no hierarchy of severity or proportionality to treatment</p>
<p>They have to keep saying these same dog whistles, they are the inputs.  But the translation is what the reprogrammed mind will output. The translation is like a value stored in a variable in object oriented computer programming. </p>
<p>Only an agency would know how to do this. Now why would they need an agency to develop a marketing campaign for something that is supposed to be a deadly disease? No other virus in history has had it's own marketing campaign. Not even the famous HIV. Why now?</p>
<p>This is why its hard to get through to doomers. Their minds have been reprogrammed and its permanent.  The only way to hack through this is to create a fresh term and start to make new verbal associations with it. The reason why they think this is a conspiracy theory is because they are groomed to be consumers.</p></p>

        <p>I agree. The news has turned into propaganda. My family loves cnn/MSNBC, and I'm tired of the idiotic catchphrases. </p>
<p>"Its not like anything we have ever seen before!" Really? Is this the first coronavirus ever??? It's like the common cold, sars, and mers do not exist. We dont have vaccines for those either btw. </p>
<p>"133,000 have died, and its you-know - who's fault!" They never breakdown the deaths by age. Sadly, many people in nursing homes were already close to death. That's not the same as healthy 20 somethings dying. </p>
<p>Many people are working at home and watching the news 6+ hrs a day.</p>

        <p>Every entity must filter information before releasing to the public. Firms are contracted to do this for them.  It's a key component to a psyop. </p>
<p>Imagine being in a marketing advertising board meeting. When you recieve covid content,  ask yourself: what is the purpose of this content? </p>
<p>If the information communicated does little for your safety (99% of it) it can be disregarded as propaganda.  If Crisis actors such as the Italian live streaming in front of a dead body or a nurse balling out tears over alleged dead bodies piling up, can this content be beneficial to your well being?. Of course not.</p>
<p>These stories dont make you immune the virus. At the time these stories were published, everything was locked down and everyone knew to wear mask and wash hands. So what was the motive behind this content?</p>
