        <p>Also, when did being more like China become our goal? Seeing a lot of "we should do it because China does," especially since covid hysteria started. How is this a persuasive argument?</p>

        <p>It’s the friggin opposite of persuasive! China is lame in many ways, most especially their human rights violations and lack of democracy. Before this we NEVER talked about being like China. </p>
<p>It’s possible that it’s because China made it look like they handled the virus soooo successfully, but we know for a fact that Chinese media isn’t independent. Nor their government truthful (hello, they are like Russia). So it feels like a con job on China’s part. We shouldn’t be looking up to them. If China was surging out of control with cases, we’d never know it. They control the media exiting the country, guys!</p>

        <p>Masks don't work as intended when worn by lay people. I'd rather have people keeping a reasonable distance and washing their hands.</p>
<p>One should also consider the possible negative impact on children's immune system. It needs to be challenged to develop.</p>
<p>Those are my reasons I don't want masks to become the social norm. Aside from that, I wouldn't accept mandatory masks on sheer principle.</p>

        <p>&rt;mask wearing should become permanent</p>
<p>What an abhorrent, disgusting thought.  <em>Hide your face in shame at all times.  Make yourself unreadable by your fellow human beings.  The human face is a symbol of disease and death.</em>  This is the message that permanent mask-wearing sends.  It's dehumanizing and degrading and a scourge upon society's collective mental health.</p>
<p>&rt;it's "not a big deal"</p>
<p>Wearing a life vest isn't a big deal, but you don't see anyone wearing one when they're not on a boat.  Wearing a condom isn't a big deal, but you don't see anyone wearing one when they're not having sex.  Wearing a hard hat isn't a big deal, but you don't see anyone wearing one when they're not on a construction site.  So, big deal or no big deal, why the fuck would you expect a perfectly healthy person to wear a mask?</p>
<p>&rt;prevents others from getting sick</p>
<p><em>If the wearer is sick</em>.  It doesn't prevent an asymptomatic person from spreading a virus they don't even have.  Sure, wear a mask if you have the flu and you're running out to CVS for more DayQuil, that's fine.  "Permanent" mask wearing?  Fuck you.  I am not "permanently" diseased, and nor is anyone else, for that matter.</p>
<p>&rt;it's what everyone does in China</p>
<p>So?  Who gives a fuck?  America isn't China.  They also eat crickets and other insects in China, maybe we should start doing that too?  Anybody who uses this as an "argument" is an obvious CCP shill.</p>

        <p>I was putting on my mask in my car yesterday before going to the grocery store. When I looked in the mirror to make sure it was adjusted right, I saw my reflection of only my eyes, and it creeped me out. I can’t believe that there are people out there who expect me to do this forever even when I am not sick, as I haven’t been even these last six months. All I can think is that those types of people have a fetish for oppression and control. They don’t want anyone to make their own choices again or have liberties. I just hate going out and only seeing eyes and zombie-like expressions.</p>

        <p>My thought is that there were anti mask leagues in 1918 and people had the same real concerns about it being a step towards losing more freedoms.</p>
<p>In the end what happened was everyone wore masks, time passed and people returned to mask free life without repercussions as they have in some Asian countries I am familiar with.</p>
<p>I understand that things are much more complicated now and there are evil opportunists in our midst but in general I think it could be a positive step to admit our failures, follow our own past successes, buckle down and get through this as a group since being entitled individuals so far has only prolonged suffering for the masked and maskless alike.</p>
<p>edit-I'm new here and sorry if I just walked into the wrong echo chamber-I was attracted to the free thinker thing at the top of the page.</p>

        <p>The masks of 1918 were literally made of cheesecloth: see “Red Cross Tells How to Make Masks at Home” in https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045433/1918-10-17/ed-1/seq-1/</p>
<p>It is safe to say many of the masks of 1918 did nothing. I think we are in a similar situation today. I don’t care about freedoms as much as I care about being bullshitted to. I don’t think it is sustainable for authorities to keep making up whatever they’d like. We are burning the reputations of our institutions on knee-jerk bullshit.</p>
<p>Having lived under an authoritarian regime, eventually the goodwill runs out. There are only so many arbitrary rules than people will follow before many lose faith in the system entirely. I think we are getting there, and it makes our country weaker.</p>
<p>In life sometimes you must say no.</p>

        <p>Good points and I'm glad we can agree on something-being lied to and taken advantage of is a larger issue for me as well.   Neither of us wants to go where they're pointing and both see where it leads.    I lost faith in 2008 &amp; I'm thankful that makes things easier for me than for most. </p>
<p>I feel like masks have become a trollish topic.  What if I'm not into cosplay and don't want to tailgate with monster truck magas or identify with gas mask hoodie folks?   There are valid arguments for any side and the referee (Fauci or fill in the blank) is a flip flop that can't make a trustworthy call.  Now that we are going from pan to endemic, there’s a more complex unaddressed reality &amp; we haven’t had a clear directive since March or so with flatten the curve.</p>
