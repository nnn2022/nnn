    <strong>A comment from r/askscience regarding vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>Delta arose in India when vaccination levels there were extremely low. Delta has only slightly increased vaccine resistance relative to the earlier strains of SARS-CoV-2. And delta has greatly increased transmission capacity.</p>
<p>So delta arose in the absence of vaccination, doesn’t do much to avoid immunization, and has obvious selective advantages unrelated to vaccination. So yes, the delta variant would still be here if there was no vaccination. In fact, if vaccination had been rolled out fast enough, delta (and other variants) would have been prevented, because the simplest way to reduce variation is to reduce the pool from which variants can be selected - that is, vaccinate to make far fewer viruses, making fewer variants.</p>
<p>For all the huge push anti-vax liars are currently making for the meme that vaccination drives mutation, it’s obviously not true, just from common sense. A moment’s thought will tell you that this isn’t the first vaccine that’s been made - we have hundreds of years experience with vaccination — and vaccines haven’t driven mutations in the past. Measles vaccination is over 50 years old, and measles didn’t evolve vaccine resistance. Polio vaccination is around 60 years old, no vaccine resistance. Yellow fever vaccine has been used for over 90 years, no vaccine-induced mutations. Mumps, rubella, smallpox. No vaccine driven mutations.  </p>
<p>and the reply:   </p>
<p>I think there's a common misconception that needs to be addressed here- something that makes a lot of people believe that vaccines can cause mutations in viruses. Since antibiotics can cause resistant bacteria to evolve over time, it's easy to think that something similar can occur with viruses and vaccines. However, this is a fallacy. Unlike antibiotics, vaccines don't create selective pressure for resistant strains of a virus. At least no more-so than naturally acquired immunity does.</p>
<p>This requires some explanation. Bacteria are living organisms that reproduce on their own. Bacteria that can cause infection in humans can also exist and grow in any suitable environment. Antibiotics are chemicals which can kill certain species of bacteria but which are not harmful to human cells. As enough bacteria are exposed to an antibiotic, occasionally one might have a mutation which gives them a resistance to it, and this resistance allows that bacterium to outcompete their sisters which do not have that gene, and eventually become dominant, thus making an antibiotic less useful over time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, viruses are not living cells. They cannot reproduce on their own. Instead, they reproduce by attaching themselves to another cell and injecting genetic material into it. This material hijacks the cell's protein and RNA or DNA making machinery and turns it into a "virus factory", and preventing it from doing its normal job. The cell then releases the viruses into the host's body and then viruses can infect other cells. In the human body, your immune system identifies infected cells and kills them. It also creates antibodies which can bind to virus particles and destroy them. But it takes time for your immune system to "learn" how to make the proper antibodies for a given strain of virus. During this time, many cells become infected, creating more viruses and damaging tissue. And as viruses are created, occasionally your cell's machinery leaves a transcription error, or "mutation", which can change the way the virus attacks the body. Usually the mutations are irrelevant or cause the virus to be unable to infect a cell. However, very rarely a mutation can cause a virus to be able to do something very different than previously possible- like infect new types of cells or even jump species. Or, in some cases, to evade antibodies which were effective against prior strains of the virus.</p>
<p>A vaccine gives your body a chance to recognize proteins in a certain virus and make antibodies without actually infecting you with the virus. This way, if you actually are exposed to the virus, you will fight it off without it having as many chances to reproduce. Fewer reproduction events means fewer chances to create a mutation which will evade the vaccine. Vaccine derived immunity is very similar to "natural" immunity. It's not doing anything to the viruses that your immune system wouldn't have done anyway, but gives it fewer chances to mutate.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to highlight the fact that vaccines kill viruses in the exact same way as your immune system already does, so there's nothing special for them to develop resistance to versus natural immunity. Antibiotics are a completely separate mechanism. You can kill a petri dish full of streptococcus with some penicillin, and the bacteria can also evolve resistance in said petri dish. If you take a vaccine and mix it with a vial of virus particles, it will have no effect on it. In fact, some types of vaccines are designed to PRESERVE virus particles so that they can be put in your body without being destroyed.</p></p>

        <p>It's a leaky vaccine.  Leaky vaccines lead to mutations.  It's that simple.</p>
