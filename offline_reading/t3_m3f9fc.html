        <p>I know what you mean, a good friend of mine just got it yesterday and was out celebrating while still wearing a mask and social distancing. I started asking her why she felt like she had to get it and she couldn’t come up with any reasons other than peer pressure and to protect her 80+ grandfather........ Shes a perfectly healthy 25 year old and competes in gym fitness competitions! Why in the holy name of fuck does anyone under 50 think their immune system isn’t strong enough to beat a 99% survivable flu?? There is literally no justification for it and she’s posting all over social like she’s saving lives. </p>
<p>Idk I just don’t get people my age group anymore. When did we all become mindless sheep believing everything we see and hear from a govt that has a record of consistently lying to their people?</p>

        <p>I'm still frustrated from Wednesday night, and I guess need to vent. I dropped my son off at his first basketball practice. Why starting basketball in March? Because it was completely unsafe two weeks ago, for 10 year olds. Not pros or college or anything, duh.</p>
<p>Anyway, guy at the community center opens the door for us, points my son to the thermometer, and stops me to direct me back to the car. Closed practice. Covid.</p>
<p>So, I put my kid on a basketball court with 7 other kids he has never met before. They're being coached by two people we've never seen before. And the guy at the door is completely new to us as well. The other end of the court has another team practicing, so another 9-10 people. But I'm the threat?</p>
<p>Ok, think of the other families. But they did the same thing. Threw their kid from their car, into the stranger-filled gym, and then back into their car. Whatever other families had, I have now anyway, right? Then we went home, delivering God knows what to the rest of the family, including the dog. So why can't I go sit far away from everyone, mostly stare at a game on my phone, and occasionally shout, "Hey, good shot bud!" at my kid?</p>

        <p>This is mostly the case. 45 minute one-way to practice, it's a 90 minute practice. So, I would get home, immediately turn around for pick up. </p>
<p>Especially since it's a new season and completely new group, I didn't want the kid to feel abandoned or whatever, I'm definitely not there to coach. My basketball career ended before I was 10, so he's beyond my level now!</p>

        <p>Some of my friends and family who don't want to get the vaccine are starting to get heavily pressured to get it. I was really hoping the people pressuring others would just respect personal choice. Now we're going to have to start explaining to them why we're not getting it, and we'll probably look like bat shit crazy conspiracy theorists to them unfortunately.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the links.</p>
<p>Is this the best info we have from ISL? </p>
<p>Do they have anything similar to USA's VAERS or UK's Yellow Card system where you can read reports about side effects/deaths?</p>

        <p>Would anyone be interested in a support group run through a discord channel? people could voice chat with others who are struggling with the lock downs. I know a few people who have been taking it very hard and I'd like to offer my support to anyone who needs people they can socialize with who'm also don't agree with mask, lock downs etc. If theres enough interest I'll make a discord server.</p>

        <p>Food pantries around here been having a lot of food giveaways, complete with hawkers shouting "FREE FOOD!" on the side of the road. Anyone else see anything similar in their area? I'm not sure who the food is for or who donated it in the first place; folks in my town are poor, too poor to be donating boxes and boxes of free food, but not so poor to really need those boxes and boxes of free food. And it's always the same: apples, potatoes, onions, baby carrots, chicken meatballs, big tubs of yogurt, and this unlabelled cheese that looks like that melty Velveeta-like government cheese but apparently don't melt for shit. Every week, my mother-in-law - yes, always my mother-in-law, how fucking stereotypical, right? - gets a box or two of food we don't really want or need, and she got four boxes today to give people who don't want or need it either. We keep the potatoes and onions, sometimes the apples, but the yogurt, cheese, and meatballs are just taking up ever-more space because no one actually likes them. As for the yogurt, this isn't a bad thing; mother-in-law proudly told us how the yogurt gives her the shits with zero regard to the fact that we were about to eat. And she says the chicken meatballs are "really good!", she'll eat them eventually, but she never actually does. Everyone else just gives the meatballs to their dogs. But seriously, where the fuck is all this food coming from and why are they so freely giving it away? Something seems off about it....</p>

        <p>In response to your reply that a mod deleted for trolling. For the record:</p>
<p>&rt;You completely swerved past my point. When old people die of COVID you people don't give a shit and syy COVID really isn't that bad.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;When old people with other pre existing conditions die of "vaccines", suddenly it's a serious issue. I read some of the reports, a huge number of people have some sort of pre-existing condition and it's likely they died of that.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You just want to continue the spread of COVID and prevent people from getting vaccines to cause more needless deaths, it's very clear.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;suddenly it's a serious issue</p>
<p>I didn't swerve past at all, I said we only point out that people are dying because it's hypocritical of you NOT to care about people dying hours after taking experimental mRNA after claiming everything you did was to protect other people.</p>
<p>I don't give a shit, let people take their vaccine and die or have a one in three chance of side effects. But don't force that on us.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;a huge number of people have some sort of pre-existing condition and it's likely they died of that</p>
<p>So all COVID deaths are caused by COVID but vaccine deaths are likely to be caused by pre-existing conditions? Again, hypocritical.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You just want to continue the spread of COVID and prevent people from getting vaccines to cause more needless deaths, it's very clear.</p>
<p>Yeah you got me, I'm basically a James Bond villain. I've done my research and found the tests can't accurately diagnose COVID, the deaths include other causes after a positive test (which again, can't diagnose COVID), the numbers are controlled by politics instead of science, and a third of all excess deaths in 2020 in the US weren't even put down as COVID. I'm going to leave some of my research here for you to ignore because that's what doomers do:</p>

        <p>Don’t wanna argue with anyone but I’m just very curious, if everyone wants to get past the lockdown and mask shit, wouldn’t wearing masks and getting the vaccine get us to that path a lot quicker? I mean their is a lot of states opening back up primarily because the majority of older folks have the vaccine.</p>

        <p>No because it's not about the virus. Can't speak for the US but here in the UK mask compliance is extremely high and we are still in this mess, most elderly are vaccinated already and the folks in charge are fear mongering about a "third wave", how it's not over yet and how we might need lockdowns every two years due to climate change. They're not even pretending it will be over after people get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Fair points, but nobody is saying wearing masks will completely stop the spread, reducing the spread is the whole point of wearing it, who knows maybe if their was no masks in the UK it’d be even worse</p>

        <p>I am under the distinct impression that masks do not prevent spread. Because of personal experience getting the virus and friends getting the virus who were wearing masks over their noses the whole time they were out in public. It is not a barrier. There ARE however, ways to keep yourself more "germ free."</p>

        <p>masks do work but only slightly, and thats under the best conditions. if you really want to make a difference with them you have to have everyone in n95s and you dont reuse them. that would be ridiculous considering this virus isn't nearly as bad as most flu strains for people in good health or care, especially young people. i've personally seen my 86 year old grandmother get over it in 3 days with just zinc, zpak, and antibiotics, and she has severe dementia and severe chronic MAC lung disease from smoking 2 packs of unfiltered cigs every day for over 3 decades.</p>
<p>keep asking questions, you'll soon realize that the constant mask charade is just big international corporations/media colluding with governments to influence the masses into submission. they're making masks and vaccines the moral high-ground that you MUST stand on to fit into our society. the everyday joe just follows along unaware that he is literally doing their work for them.</p>
<p>now the that elite knows that they can manipulate the masses to censor anyone that they disagree with... what will they do next? spoiler alert: nothing good ever comes when corporations, media, and government work together to shape the minds of the people.</p>
<p>fascism is NOT a "far-right" ideology like you've been told. it goes both ways, and currently it's going left.</p>

        <p>It wasn't only in Italy. 1930s Germany is a good example.
The fascist, tactics were to program an idiotic population to believe there is a threat, and the reason the threat won't end is because of certain people who are "not like us" or "don't follow the rules". These scapegoats hence "ruin it for everyone else, thus they are the enemy."</p>
<p>They're doing the same thing with covid now.</p>
<p>Pretending that covid is a threat (even though it's an extremely low IFR virus that didn't warrant any of the drsconian measures), and the reason covid "won't go away" are those horrible antimaskers (even though covid is endemic and will never be eradicated).</p>

        <p>The masks dont do shit, so that ends that part of the problem. Just stop with those mandates and we are half back to normality. The only people that SHOULD be getting the vaccine are people in the 65+ range or people with predisposed health issues. Healthy young people do not NEED it. Period. The sooner that fact is being pushed, THEN we are back to normal. Let people chose what is best for the own health and dont let the minority and the Government decide for you. If you cant agree with that, then I guess we will forever agree to disagree. Signed, someone who is been living in a free state for almost a year, gone to bars, visited family and friends, traveled to different states and visited two grandmothers in their 80s, never been tested, will not get THIS vaccine, and has seen no reason to shut down the country over this. Take care.</p>

        <p>I should have rephrased. In very very particular cases, sure, they have some value. SOME. Like 40 people packed into a tiny room and 2 of them are sick, then it might help some. But thats not a real world scenario for 99% of the population. Wearing them out side? Why? Just why? You would have to open mouth cough into someone else's mouth in order to spread ANYTHING to them.  Working in an office with people that aren't sick, and are smart enough to stay home if they are? Dont need one. Its the every day application of them that does nothing. Its become a horse and pony show for the sake of "keeping people calm/happy" so people dont get sued. That's all its really for. Go look at numbers (from a non biased source) for states with and with out mandates. They variance between them is minute at best.</p>

        <p>The fact that numerous studies prior to March 2020 (even from the CDC &amp; WHO themselves) shown that masks were never significantly effective at reducing transmission of respiratory viruses and in most cases did very little or downright nothing, should be a big red flag. Even Fauci himself was saying something completely different back in February of 2020. The fact that covid just kept spreading after months of mask mandates should be enough glaring proof that masks either do nothing, or actually just make it worse. If masks significantly reduced the spread of respiratory viruses than cases wouldn't be "surging" for months.</p>
<p>Also, governments enacting fines for people not wearing masks outside (where covid is the least likely to transmit) is extremely disgusting. Respiratory viruses are transmitted primarily prolonged contact in small spaces, this is why people in your household are the most likely way for a virus like this to transmit. Simply having no symptoms and breathing within a couple of feet of someome is highly unlikely to transit the virus.</p>

        <p>Upvoted because you seem to be here in good faith. If this were about slowing the spread, we would have seen states and businesses opening back up in July when the hospitals didn't get overrun and cases hit a constant low rate for a span of several months. They didn't, so even supposing that masks worked, if we went to full, 100% compliance (and even now compliance is extremely high), this wouldn't be over.</p>
<p>Now, for the vaccine, I refuse to take it for two reasons. First, because the "pandemic" has clearly been a politically-motivated event and I don't trust that the medical authorities have our best interests in mind. They've induced mass hysteria and now think they will get to take credit for ending the mass hysteria they created.</p>
<p>Second, because, even supposing the vaccine is absolutely safe, and supposing that the medical authorities and the government do have our best interests at heart, by those medical authorities' own data, I'm not at significant risk, and I would like to minimize the number of things I have injected into my body.</p>

<p>For sunglasses, they protect my eyes. Blocking UV wavelengths is a very straightforward and provable thing. Plus they make it more comfortable to be in a bright environment and the polarized sunglasses help me see farther into the water while fishing.</p>
<p>For the shirt, shoes, etc. these weren't brought about for public use several months ago in an effort to virtue signal, and they actually serve a purpose, so I have no problem with that requirement.</p>

<p>You can always choose to better. But that's up to you.</p>
