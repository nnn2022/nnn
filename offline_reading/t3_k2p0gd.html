        <p>We‚Äôve apparently decided that ad hominem attacks are not a logical fallacy, but an acceptable way to ‚Äúwin‚Äù an argument. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, we also have successfully turned science into a religion - ‚Äúbelieve in science!‚Äù Of course, by science, they mean what they are told is ‚Äúscience‚Äù by talking heads and should therefore be uncritically accepted as Absolute Truth. Anything other than complete, unquestioning acceptance of ‚Äúscience‚Äù is heresy. </p>
<p>It took humanity a very long time to learn how to think logically. It took us a few decades to decide that we‚Äôd just rather not think at all. We‚Äôre watching humanity voluntarily devolve.</p>

<p>Who actually is this 'we' and 'us' you are talking about? Humanity isn't an cohesive acting entity, but simply a word for a large number of very different individuals of the species human.</p>

<p>I didn't. I really have a problem with this whole collectivism thing you are expressing in this post in nearly every sentence.</p>
<p>I'm not responsible for nor part of other peoples stupidity or violence. They do what they do, and I do what I do. </p>
<p>This is important because collectivism is one of the most destructive ideologies out there:</p>
<p>For example: "Oh these evil germans!" was basically the pseudojustification to blow whole cities  full of innocent people up (many of them being small children and infants, there is absolutely no possibility to deny them being completely innocent), because of the crimes of a few individuals.</p>
<p>The people acting out these most extreme mass murders are most severe criminals themselves.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Humans are individuals, and you can't blame one individual for a thing someone else did.</p>

        <p>I am completely individualistic. </p>
<p>However, I am not talking about individuals. I am talking about the prevailing culture and behavior of society at large. That is inherently collectivist. </p>

        <p>I think universally calling it a tantrum is an unfair categorization. Are some people having tantrums? Sure. But majority of people have legitimate reasons for not wanting to wear them. You just have to listen.</p>
<p>Maybe not "legitimate" from the perspective of maskers, but it goes beyond just "I don't like it so I ain't gonna do it!" Like many maskers would have you believe.</p>
<p>You don't have to agree. Just make an effort to understand and honestly represent the other sides perspective.</p>

        <p>The scariest one was from a guy who said "there will be more viruses. This is the new way of living. Mask up.</p>
<p>In fairness he seems to be the outlier. There were plenty of reasonable answers in there. But the fact that there's people who want this to be permanent is disturbing.</p>

        <p>The top answer is really fascinating. Nothing the writer said is based on reality.</p>
<p>&rt; Until the risk of me having and giving covid to someone else is neglible. Once schools, bars, and other public spaces have been opened (with masks) without causing spikes in cases. </p>
<p>This happened in a load of places: the UK, Florida, Wisconsin, Austria, just to name a few. If they did have "spikes" again it happened months later.</p>
<p>&rt; Once hospitals are no longer overwhelmed. Most likely this will not occur without a vaccine given people's unwillingness to follow public health guidelines.</p>
<p>Literally nowhere in the world were hospitals overwhelmed, outside of Northern Italy. Besides, hospitals are regularly overwhelmed for the flu, but no one ever suggested lockdowns and mass mask wearing to stop that.</p>
<p>&rt; So, once enough of the population has been vaccinated such that the risk of covid infection would be similar to diseases like measles (aka very low).</p>
<p>Is this person implying we should have locked down society for the measles?</p>

        <p>Your approach was interesting, though too submissive for my taste, especially in response to people openly bullying you.</p>
<p>And since you asked a very good question, what mostly happened was as it usually goes in such cases, they desperately avoid the question* and start distracting as much as possible, and shift the focus to attacking you personally.</p>
<p>The most obvious way is your post history, and if you wouldn't have any they would've simply used that as way to dismiss you.</p>
<p>*or in the rare case they don't, they still remain as vague as possible and combine that with virtue signalling</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These tactics aren't happening out of coincidence, they know what they are doing, though the thread was obviously expected to be full of shills spewing their propaganda and bully you. Reddit is extremely toxic if one thinks about how absolutely fucked up that is.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Like all divisive issues, it's likely that the answer lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I would be careful with that one. If two people are arguing about the color of the sky, -one saying yellow, the other saying blue- it doesn't follow that the sky is therefore green (middle ground fallacy).</p>

        <p>The reason I took such a tame approach because I was coming into their subreddit, basically walking into their home. I had hoped that by being as passive as possible I would get some of the more aggressive of them to take a more relaxed approach. In some cases it worked. I received a number of comments saying, "your question is completely fair" or "you aren't being rude, you don't deserve to get stomped on"</p>
<p>If I were to get aggressive about it I'd be sinking to their level. I genuinely just want to start fair and honest conversations</p>
