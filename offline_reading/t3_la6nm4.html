        <p>Shocking!</p>
<p>No, really. Why are people surprised by this? They've been playing fast and loose with our rights since March of last year. The legal system continues to largely favor the pro-lockdown and pro-vaccine mandates side.</p>
<p>We are not winning, folks. Next comes the health passports, and "Great Reset".</p>

        <p>This is just another step in making us buckle down and not question our government.  <br>
They already convinced us to give up many freedoms "for the greater good" and as a society we are compliant and complacent. <br>
They already convinced us that we can't drive the car we paid for, on roads we also paid for, while drinking beer we bought with our own money because of these bogus "drunk driving" laws. Hell we can't even drive sober over an arbitrary speed limit because it "endangers others" which is bullshit. <br>
If you're scared of being killed by a drunk speeding driver then just stay at home and be afraid of everything.<br>
We should have the right to do what we want and how we with the things we buy, don't need no stupid government telling us what's right and what's wrong!!!</p>

        <p>They're been changing laws for several years in the US IRT forced vaccinations to enter public school or recreational sports.</p>
<p>People applauded and said "just pull them out and homeschool if you don't agree !"</p>
<p>Okay, but now you same fucking people are also largely against homeschool as we need to get the youth properly indoctrinated during their most formative years.</p>
<p>It's been longer than March 2020 that they've been planning shit out... Though March gave them a <em>great</em> opening to really ramp it all up.</p>

        <p>I received my first email saying "cARrY yoUr cArD."  This is just a small store but you better believe the passport is coming.  Also, it will start with the vaccine, it will later include a full physical including whatever they deem necessary.</p>
<p>&rt;So I am staying away for the store for another week or so while.  The store will reopen to visitors after the recommended time period after I have received my second shot.  Carry your vaccination card when you visit.  The new more transmissible strains of the virus are scary,  the virus is invisible and not every infected person feels symptoms.  If everybody does their bit, we can get through through this mess.  Masks will be required until the coast is well and truly clear.     Please stay healthy and get your shots when available.</p>

        <p>No employer can force anyone to get a vaccine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/17/2016-11558/regulations-under-the-americans-with-disabilities-act">Title 29 CFR 1635</a> makes such attempts illegal, especially with regards to complying with Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>Even if an employer wanted to create a wellness program that included an objective to reduce covid infections, there are many basic preconditions that must be met by an employer, in accordance with Section 1630.14(d)(1), before such a program is ever realized:</p>
<p>&rt; ...an employee health program, including any disability-related
&rt; inquiries and medical examinations that are part of such a program,
&rt; must be “reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease.”
&rt; This standard is similar to the standard under the tri-Department
&rt; regulations applicable to health-contingent wellness programs. In
&rt; order to meet this standard, a program—including a wellness
&rt; program that is unrelated to a group health plan—must have a
&rt; reasonable chance of improving the health of, or preventing disease
&rt; in, participating employees and must not be overly burdensome, a
&rt; subterfuge for violating the ADA or other laws prohibiting employment
&rt; discrimination, or highly suspect in the method chosen to promote
&rt; health or prevent disease. Programs consisting of a measurement,
&rt; test, screening, or collection of health-related information without
&rt; providing results, follow-up information, or advice designed to
&rt; improve the health of participating employees would not be
&rt; reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease, unless the
&rt; collected information actually is used to design a program that
&rt; addresses at least a subset of conditions identified. Further, imposing
&rt; a penalty solely on an employee's failure to achieve a particular
&rt; health outcome (such as failing to attain a certain weight or
&rt; cholesterol level) would, in many instances, discriminate against
&rt; individuals based on disability. The interpretive guidance offers
&rt; examples of programs that would and would not meet this standard.</p>
<p>Participation in any employer's wellness program, is <strong>voluntary</strong>, in accordance with Sections 1630.14(d)(2)(i) through (iv). This also defines the definition of, "Voluntary".  </p>
<p>This section is defined by 3 key rules:</p>
<p><strong>1. Does not require employees to participate</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. No health coverage denied, due to non-participation</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. No adverse actions or retaliation should be taken against, or employees coerced, for their non-participation</strong>  </p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, no employer can force an employee to take a vaccine, without the risk of setting off any violations of Title 29 CFR 1635.</p>
