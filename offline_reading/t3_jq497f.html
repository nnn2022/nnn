    <strong>I don't want doomers snitching on others for having large gatherings or parties ever again.</strong>
    <p><p>So, with the recent mass Biden celebrations in huge gatherings, I feel that for doomers who attended those, they should no longer snitch on others for parties/large gatherings again. This is basically deja vu with the BLM protests/riots.</p>
<p>On another note, I often hear doomers complaining about the virus being politicized. In a way I think they're actually doing that very thing. If you gather en masse for protesting racism, rioting, or by celebrating Trump's demise/Biden's victory, it's acceptable but anything else is apparently selfish. Trump rallies were labeled as superspreader events. I think that's also politicizing IMO.</p></p>

        <p>I thought it was pretty hilarious how Halloween was all but cancelled for (incredibly low-risk) little kids, yet not even a week later we're having massive celebrations in the streets that are perfectly acceptable. Just like the BLM "protests" vs. Trump rallies or any party/wedding.</p>

        <p>They’ve had a lot of practice. Teachers have been bellyaching that they are underpaid and under appreciated for decades. The opposite is true, but who cares about truth. Or kids. Or society. We are unionized, we don’t have to care about anything but ourselves!</p>

        <p>Covid was a tool and it did its job well. Now it will be "cured" or more precisely the truth of it will come out. Biden will claim he let science dictate and the herd will bah in excited gratitude for our savior. The numbers of its true effect will come out and they will say "Trump was lying to get money", while forgetting it was they who took the money. </p>
<p>Biden will wave his magic hand over the whole of creation and make all well again. And if he cant, well we can always blame the Republican Senate like Obama was so fond of doing.</p>

        <p>Of course the mouthpiece of the government (media) is going to make anti-lockdowners the enemy. The goal IS the restrictions as someone else said so well. </p>
<p>I'm sorry but Trump was never the savior that so many think he is either. He is simply there as controlled opposition in my opinion. A persona that says all the "right" things for someone sick of governmental imposition. Then people can look to him as a beacon of hope, when in reality he is just working for the man the same as the rest of em. Sorry to break it to ya. </p>
<p>To think the USA will escape the harsh lockdowns that the rest of world are experiencing is wishful thinking. It was always the plan. This seems to be a worldwide take over. It is bigger than US politics.</p>

        <p>Another thing I'd like to mention is that I have seen some people saying that the partying isn't a good idea during the pandemic but that's it. That's not on the level of saying that the celebrations are "superspreader events" and that participants are selfish idiots.</p>
