        <p>From your perspective, why do you think people like you have to be told what to think by an approved authority? </p>
<p>Are you incapable of formulating your own opinions? Is it just hive mind behavior? General low intellect? Or just a total ignorance of history? Honestly so curious. The Tuskegee experiment was 100% PHS approved.</p>

        <p>Nice deflect attempt. I could ask you the same questions. There seems to be a hive-type thing going on with contagious schizophrenia...mass delusion and you believe you’re thinking. </p>
<p>Yes the Tuskegee experiment was horrible and unethical and should never have occurred. Unsure why you’re drawing an analogy here though. If you want to talk about low intellect, then maybe you should try showing that you have some yourself. Love to hear your analysis on the situation from a scientific perspective.</p>

        <p>It is so sad. We are so accustomed to looking at the numbers of how many people have died we forget the affect it has on their families, friends, and communities. When we talk about the lives covid has taken we can't simply view the numbers, we have to view the people they represent. Imagine if you had to go to the funeral of each person that died with the virus. Maybe then people would feel some empathy for what others are going through right now, rather than downplaying the pain and suffering we are experiencing because as a society we cannot band together and handle this pandemic together. </p>
<p>I know change is hard, and that thinking that this virus could last a long time is scary. I know being apart from loved ones is difficult, and having to wear a mask can be uncomfortable. I know last year was a year of losses and missed experiences. But if we quit fighting the people who are helping us (healthcare workers, scientists, disease experts) then this won't have to be a new normal. It will be a temporary struggle. Then we can get back together and embrace one another without fear that we will lose anyone we love. </p>
<p>I know one post on reddit is never going to change anyone's mind. But I do hope maybe something I said is something that someone out there needed to hear.</p>

        <p>Imagine if you had to go to the funeral of everyone who kills themselves during this, doesn't get cancer treatment during this, old people trapped in carehomes who have massively deteriorated mentally due to lack of contact (and they will never recover), drug overdoses, more children have been killed at home this year (from a social worker I know). Are you able to feed and clothe and house all the people who have lost their jobs, businesses, homes? If no, then don't dictate to others they have to accept this.</p>
<p>Almost no one here thinks the virus doesn't exist btw, people always assume we do. Most of us are here because we're extremely concerned about all the side effects that you aren't even allowed to mention without people assuming you're a selfish right wing nutjob conspiracy theorist. The healthcare workers posting sanctimonious shit like this are trying to crush any dissenting views by using such emotive language, and that's not right. There are heavy consequences to these lockdowns and they aren't being discussed.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your kind and open tone when posting here, thanks.</p>

        <p>I do agree that there are huge consequences of the pandemic and lockdown that reach beyond the virus itself. I also feel that time spent working against measures to be taken against the virus, rather than for places that can help with these other issues is slightly misplaced. If you are worried about mental health during this time, you can do mental health check-ins with friends and family, as well as offering resources or time to an organization who is trying to do something about it. I suppose I am just very frustrated with the people using this time to try and tear each other down or place blame on others when if we took that energy instead and put it towards making a difference maybe we could get through this all together faster.</p>
<p>Thank you, for pointing out my wrongful assumption and being willing to have a conversation with me. Its reassuring when even though people may not agree with you, they still can have meaningful and respectful discussions.</p>

        <p>For me, I've always struggled slightly with mental health, but I've never solved it by talking to people or professional help, it's always been through staying busy with work, going to the gym, getting out the house, and a lot of people's coping mechanisms (which may not appear to be coping mechanisms from the outside) have been taken away, and I think that's wrong.</p>
<p>There's also people struggling with bad home situations (eg. abusive parents) that can't be out the house all day for school or work now so are having to deal with them all day, as I said previously child deaths have gone up this year in the UK, and domestic violence has increased. You can't speak to a counsellor or meditate your way out of that, and there honestly is not enough resources for all these people that are suffering, who previously were getting by using their personal coping mechanisms.</p>
<p>Some people were stuck alone in different countries from their spouse or family for months. There was even a poster on here who couldn't get to his wife or gf who was diagnosed with a terminal illness.</p>
<p>I am anti lockdown and anti enforced masks but I do distance from people I don't know, go shopping at quiet times, and I've always been good with washing my hands and not touching my face (suffering acne prepared me well), so it's not like I want to go wild but I think the measures we are taking are so excessive and causing so much damage, I can't support them.</p>
<p>There also seems to be no exit strategy. At what point can we stop with these restrictions? People have always died from illnesses and we accepted it, it seems like even 1 death from coronavirus is too many and we'll have to be locked down forever, so it just feels pointless.</p>
<p>I think these are a few reasons why people are struggling, and everyone will reach their breaking point at a different time. Most of us on this sub are struggling and just want to be able to talk to others about it, without being shamed or called selfish.</p>
