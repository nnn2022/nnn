    <strong>How has counting COVID cases and deaths changed since Biden took office?</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://redstate.com/michael_thau/2021/01/20/total-coincidence-alert-who-issues-new-c19-guidelines-requiring-2nd-test-for-symptom-less-on-day-biden-takes-office-n313400">A single positive PCR test for the virus isn’t going to cut it anymore.</a></p>
<p>The WHO has decided that the tests for the virus we’ve been relentlessly assured are the gold standard for detecting infection are, in reality, just a mere “aid for diagnosis.”</p>
<p>Clinicians now, not only can, but “must” also consider a wide array of other factors, like “timing of sampling, specimen type, assay specifics, clinical observations, patient history, confirmed status of any contacts,” and even something called “epidemiological information”—whatever that exactly is—before diagnosing anyone with COVID-19.</p>
<p>The WHO has also suddenly decided that, if you don’t show any symptoms, you’ll need to get a second test for confirmation as well.</p>
<p>That’s a whole heck of a lot of extra hoops a person has to jump through to make the list of those officially infected or killed by Covid 19</p>
<p>Whereas during the last 10 months tests were administered in spite of the high false-positives that were well known and documented. By any objective scientific measure, they are now being administered in a reasonable way, which will result in a massive decrease in both positive tests and cases. https://www.who.int/news/item/20-01-2021-who-information-notice-for-ivd-users-2020-05</p></p>
