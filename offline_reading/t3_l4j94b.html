    <strong>I just lost control and blew up on my dad with my entire family home about masksðŸ˜”</strong>
    <p><p>I was talking to my dad about masks and he said well I just put it on because it's no big deal. I said yea I'm sure when they mandate vaccines it'll still be "no big deal" and he said that will never happen. I accidentally raised my voice and said it was already happening and they're giving out records of it. Some more voices raised and now I'm sleeping at a rest stop in my car. My entire family is on the government kool aid and they just bury themselves in the tv screen, video games, alcohol computer whatever. I don't ever have anybody to talk to about this. It feels like everyone has been brainwashed. I'm not really sure why I'm posting this. I'm just venting I guess. I feel kind of ashamed that I wasn't able to control my anger. Thanks to whoever bothers to read this</p></p>
