        <p>I've been wanting to get my nails done again. I usually go only once a year, just before Christmas as a kind of treat to myself. I'm not really a "girly-girl" most of the time but i wasn't able to go last christmas so i wanted to go again.</p>
<p>I was out for a walk and went past the parlor i usually visit. Walked in and asked whether, if i made an appointment i would need to wear a mask. They said yes. I walked out. I'm not that desperate to get my nails done that I'm gonna submit to that shit.</p>

        <p>I don't go that often to beauty places, but right before  i made an attempt to go to the beauty store i also went to my local goldsmith/jeweler to have an old watch repaired. The shopping center it is in demands masks. I did not wear one. The store itself demands masks. I did not wear one. </p>
<p>I had to wait half an hour for them to repair my watch so i took a stroll around the mall. Went to a big-brand grocery store that is publicly very "we-follow-all-the-rules". Walked in maskless. No one asked about it.</p>
<p>Beauty parlor was the only store that asked. Guess i wont be going back there until they quit the ridiculous masking.</p>
