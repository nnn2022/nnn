        <p>Two biological sex and intersex being the third. Everything else is just made up. Like genderfluid a concept that mean your gender identity can shift from male to female or something between </p>

        <p>Intersex is not a third biological sex. And that isn't how the english language ever has or does work. When a person's gender is not known to be male or female, you have always used "they", same for referring to a theoretical person.</p>
<p>You know you don't actually need to have an opinion on linguistics or biology when you're uninformed about the topics, its perfectly acceptable to just say you don't know something.</p>

<p>I've been banned for saying I was a femboy and that I'm not interested in transitioning. Apparently because "femboy is a slur", and because me defying gender roles without being trans threatens their existence or something.</p>

        <p>PFFT LMAO Are you actually serious? Trap is a slur, but nowhere in the thread was femboy labeled as a slur. Trap and femboy are two different things. If you don't think that trap is a slur can you name three canonical traps who aren't crossdressers, femboys or transwomen.</p>
<p>You seem incapable of seperating idiots from normal people. Transpeople don't think crossdressers are secretly trans, becuse that's stupid. I also don't believe that the comments were "full of people claiming that you are secretly trans" because you showed one single comment.</p>
<p>Finally calling r/egg_irl a "groomer" sub and r/traa a hate sub is absolutely hysterical. If you are referring to the three comments on r/traa that advocated for killing cis people I imagine that you haven't heard what jokes or satire are. Cis people are allowed on r/traa as long as you are an ally, we don't hate cis people. I do agree that r/egg_irl needs to calm down woth labeling, but it's definately not a groomer sub.</p>

        <p>&rt; Trap is a slur</p>
<p>Opinion discarded, eat a bag of dicks.</p>
<p>&rt; but nowhere in the thread was femboy labeled as a slur.</p>
<p>They're literally saying not to use "femboy" because it's supposedly offensive, sounds like they're saying it's a slur to me. They also engage in that same grooming behavior by saying that Astolfo must be non-binary, even though the source material contradicts that.</p>
<p>&rt; If you don't think that trap is a slur can you name three canonical traps who aren't crossdressers, femboys or transwomen.</p>
<p>Traps <em>are</em> crossdressing boys, i.e. the same thing as femboys. In femboy cultures and communities, it is generally not considered offensive to refer to femboys as "traps". Why are you, an outsider to these communities, trying to tell <em>me</em> how I can or can't use my words?</p>
<p>Literally no one calls trans women traps. There are literally no examples of the word being used to refer to trans women. This is just people inventing things to be upset about because they want to feel like a victim.</p>
<p>And for the record, Felix Argyle and Luka Urushibara are both canonically cis boys (confirmed by the authors and by the source material several times), so that argument doesn't fly either.</p>
<p>&rt; If you are referring to the three comments on r/traa that advocated for killing cis people I imagine that you haven't heard what jokes or satire are.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1xIFn9C.png">"Lmao calls for violence are totally okay when we do it, it's just a joke guys I swear"</a></p>
<p>&rt; we don't hate cis people</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/9jxcE">This guy seemed to not be joking when he said he wanted cis people to die.</a></p>
<p>By the way, context for that thread is me being repeatedly pinged, messaged and harassed by members of that sub for calling myself a "trap".</p>

        <p>On its own, of course it does no measurable harm to anyone but the person doing it. Forcing others to go along with it is the bigger issue. Linguistic sophistry doesn't benefit us.</p>

        <p>Gender is male and female I believe, even more then behavior.  What I mean is I’m all female but grew up more Tom boy, hanging with dudes more than caddy females as some can be. 
Intersex, is this when one sex changed to be the other...transgender?   I’m old school so back in my time we hade mainly two sexes and gays, not many transgender as we have now.  I find people extremely fascinating and love striking up conversations and learning what people are about.</p>

        <p>Intersex people are born with parts of both sexes. There are also a dozen or so genetic issues/mutations that would make a person present as male or female, while genetically being the opposite sex.</p>

        <p>Happy to do so. You as well.</p>
<p>To make a point, intersex people are much more common than one might think. Usually, they don't even know. At birth they're usually fully formed in one sex and partially formed in the other. Like they present as male, but have a floating ovary, or they present as female, but have a nut. Typically the parents and doc consult, and the extra ovary or testicle is removed, and the kid goes on, never the wiser.</p>

Let's all cover our faces and stop young children from learning developmental facial recognition.  But hey, you're saving one life, or you're killing grandma, muh life is precious, right?</p>
<p>&rt;it’s not just old people</p>
<p>Yeah 6% of covid deaths being young people (most of whom had at least two comorbidities or were obese) definitely proves that this thing doesn't discriminate 🙄</p>

        <p>If you get downvotes here it means you're right. Fuck all of these people. "But muh rights!!! Dumb libs only talk about saving grandma, nobody cares about old people libs!!!! They can't make me wear a mask, it's a government scheme!!" I swear to god these people had parents that wore tinfoil hats. It's a fucking virus. A virus that spreads from person to person through infected droplets. And masks prevent those droplets from getting to other people. Jeff Bezos doesnt have a fucking microchip implanted in your mask, the ONLY thing you're doing by wearing a mask is preventing the spread of the virus. This is not step 1 of some government takeover project. Actually, better yet, if you dont want to wear a mask just fucking stay inside! I dont think anyone is ever happy to see these kinds of people in public anyway!</p>

        <p>Why is some science ok and other science not ok? Sex is biological and it works within a binary with exception in more than 1% of the population. Gender is socially constructed, and therefore can only be measured through human experience. Judith butler is my favorite gender theorist. She describes gender performativity, the idea that everyone is born naked and how you dress act and live determines your gender and how society will treat you. A non-binary person under this theory, simply breaks the performative rules set in place.</p>

        <p>I actually agree with a lot of what you say. I have no problem with people dressing in <em>any</em> way they want. I have no problem with people having "relations" with anyone (or multiple) that they want. But putting a dress on a biological male does not make him a biological female and vice versa. Personally, I see people as people, not a biological gender or race. All of this cannot change the fact that people are born (and genetically defined) as male or female. Societal definitions are psychological and philosophical differentiations, not within the purview of the physical sciences. And as for selecting one "science" or another, MSM and governments are doing just that when they trot out their selective and manufactured "scary virus" and vax numbers.</p>

        <p>Wonder why transgender people are called trans”gender” instead of trans”sex”? Transgender, including non-binary, is not about biological sex, but gender. Change in biological sex usually only occurs when a transgender person decides to undergo medical transition, which is by far proven to be the most effective way to treating gender dysphoria, which is experienced by most trans people that induces depression (and hence suicide.) No sane transgender person would claim that being transgender itself automatically change your sex, for that you have to undergo medical transition.</p>

        <p>When you factor in calling someone a 'man' or a 'woman' you aren't looking at their genitals or shape of their X or Y genes you are making that assessment based on how they look, how they act, how they present themselves and the understanding of the roles that men and women have in society.

        <p>That's a pretty disingenuous comparison. Gender theory isn't derived from verifiable observations, as determining the color of an apple is. It's based entirely on subjective feelings and societal norms (which are ever-changing). Like any of the other social sciences, it's much more culture and opinion than it is use of the actual scientific method.</p>

<p>They are mentally ill and deserve therapy. Normalizing their existence is deconstructing the gender norms that have exister for how so long. This is very bad, there are many differences between men and women and they should acknowledged. Also men need to be masculine and women feminine for a society to work</p>

        <p>Did you know that there can be multiple branches dealing with different scientific areas in the same science? Scientist who deal with covid are not the same as scientists who deal with sex and gender even though they are both biologists.</p>

        <p>&rt;And don't come with stuff like "they're gonna make us call them made up pronouns like 'xe/xem'" because everyone knows damn well that shit never happens in real life.</p>
<p>That isn't made up though, it actually happens in real life regularly. Other events, such as the canadian trans-woman suing every salon in BC for not waxing his balls, do happen and are not shut down immediately because of the cultural confusion and the assertion of rights that don't exist by activists and government.</p>
<p>I have no qualms with a woman behaving based on her stereotype of a man, and calling herself as such. I have no qualms with those who want to support this behavior. Do it all you want. I do have an issue with forcing me to recognize, affirm, and encourage this behavior, feeding into what would be classified as psychosis in any other situation.</p>
<p>I've met transsexuals that are perfectly polite and agreeable, and we have no conflict. They do their thing, I do mine. When we interact, we're civil like any other folks would be. Sadly, those numbered in the minority in my experience.</p>

        <p>You do know that this shit is the reason every other country laughs at the US right? I'm Finnish and I haven't heard a single peeson complain about having to wear a mask because we aren't little snowflakes who can't handle a piece of fabric on your face. I have worn a mask every time I go to a store or use public transit and I've had 0 problems. There are even booths that give free masks if you can't afford them so shut the fuck up and wear a mask you snowflake babies.</p>

        <p>lol what a great role model you have</p>
<p>Sexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction </p>
<p>Recent academic studies have criticized Money's work in many respects, particularly in regard to his involvement with the involuntary sex-reassignment of the child David Reimer,[3] his forcing this child and his brother to simulate sex acts which Money photographed[4] and the adult suicides of both brothers.[4]</p>

        <p>John Money did perform an unethical experiment and he was a bad person for doing that and his experiment didn't work.</p>
<p>However his model of gender, which is something different does in fact stand up to scrutiny. Attempting to use Money's unethical experiment to invalidate the concept of gender is a non-arguement.</p>

        <p>I love how they make the claim that "science" is capable of making linguistic distinctions. Science is a tool for verifying observations, not for determining "right" or "wrong", or for determining the validity of social woes. Science can be used in the measurement of social quantifiables, but only the common use of terms decides their definitions. </p>
<p>This is why I can't get over this revisionist nonsense. If you feel like you need to act like your internal stereotype of the opposite sex, go ahead. But don't manipulate my language and force me to call you by that opposite sex.</p>

<p>I mean, it’s still treated like one, and most people are too stupid to care, they’d rather just kick the minority.

<p>Yes you do.  It's called Gender Identity Disorder.  It's not just "treated" like one, it is one yet experts (who still believe it is one) were pressured into pretending it isn't because activists successfully bitched about it enough in 2012.  And I provided evidence for my claim.  (Btw, I have a disorder too, yet unlike you I'm not in denial).</p>

        <p>If it means saving a life, I would, but we won’t have to wear them forever. There are plenty of countries where everything has gone back to normal. Why?

<p>Doctors wear masks all the time outside of COVID to keep them and their patients safe during operations. Do you think they’ve enjoyed having to wear hazmat suits to work during this pandemic? Or living separately from their family to prevent potentially spreading the virus to them? It’s by no means comfortable to socially distance and wear masks, but this is a small, slightly uncomfortable thing we have to do to help everyone else.</p>

I understand wearing them as a temporary health measure, but never in the history of the world have we considered doing something that goes against human nature indefinitely, even in the name of "saving lives."  Regarding countries that are "back to normal," are they really back to normal if they need to completely lock down all over again once they detect even one case?  Would you want to just keep doing that forever?  Even if you support cocid measures, Zero Covid is a delusional idea.  </p>
<p>&rt;Doctors wear masks all the time outside of COVID to keep them and their patients safe during operations. Do you think they’ve enjoyed having to wear hazmat suits to work during this pandemic? Or living separately from their family to prevent potentially spreading the virus to them?</p>
<p>My dad is a doctor, a surgeon in fact, and by no means does he have any intention of wearing a mask for the rest of his life <em>outside of work</em>.  Nor did he need to live separately from his family; that's just the alarmist BS you were fed about healthcare workers.  Because he has a brain, and from his clinical observation, he knew that his healthy family was not at risk.  </p>
<p>&rt;It’s by no means comfortable to socially distance and wear masks, but this is a small, slightly uncomfortable thing we have to do to help everyone else.</p>
<p>So before covid, it was everyone's responsibility to protect the vulnerable from disease?  I highly doubt that you gave a second thought to protecting the elderly or those with leukemia prior to this.  I also doubt that you changed your life in any way out of consideration to the vulnerable and protecting their lives.</p>

        <p>&rt;Wearing a mask to protect those around you.</p>
<p>This is still actively in dispute. You know that, right? Available simulations are very limited in scope and contradict all previous evidence, and the only true study on real-life people was too limited to affirm or reject the idea that mass masking of the non-sick population will produce a measurable reduction in transfer. That doesn't even begin to touch on the cost-benefit analysis of healthy-population masking. Money, waste, communication, early childhood development, psychological changes, etc.</p>
<p>&rt;but I’d take 10x the discomfort of mask-wearing if it meant potentially saving a life.</p>
<p>That's your choice to make. Others may choose differently, knowing that the hypocrisy required to make such a statement is unbearable.</p>

        <p>He didn't say "more genders". He said, "gender isn't a thing". It's a set of social norms and nothing more. Being transsexual is often a result of internalizing a set of social norms to a higher-than-religious level and then determining that one should try to alter his sex to properly fit the role he's imagined for himself.</p>

<p>To be totally fair though, these ideas of gender pre-date Money. There's a certain German-speaking country that the idea was developed in first during a rather tumultuous period of its history, but we're not allowed to talk about that. Money is largely responsible for introducing it into the Anglosphere.</p>

        <p>Even with the two sexes argument, that isnt scientific. If you measure sex by genital, then there are people who don't have a sex or are a mix of the two. With the chromosome arguement, the likeliness of someone having perfect sex chromosomes is  not perfectly understood because we don't count people's chromosomes. As for a simple "You are what you were at birth" that arguement doesn't work because we know people who suffer from Gender Dysphoria typically have biology that doesn't match up with their AGAB(Assigned Gender at Birth)   </p>
<p>As for gender, putting a specific number like 52 or something doesn't make sense because it's a social construct. There aren't "infinite" per say, but there are definitely not two. There are three spirited people in Indian cultures, the Hijra in India Hijira in India has been recognized as a third gender for 1000s of years. Hijras are trans-feminine, or people born into male bodies that follow feminine norms and identites.

        <p>Exactly! There was actually a Harvard study done on transgender people, and the vast majority of their brains more closely resemble their identified gender than their birth sex. </p>

        <p>It's not even that rare. 1 in about 25000 males have XX and there are way more combinations meaning you can't really say that you have xy, because you have a dick, it's just not how chromosomes work.</p>

        <p>1 in 25000 is definitely rare in the absolute sense. It's a very small subset of a population. </p>
<p>The statement, "I have xy chromosomes because I have a penis" is technically incorrect since it's the other way around, but the assessment is an extremely accurate way to determine the presence of xy chromosomes without actually looking at the chromosomes. If 1 in 5000 have some deformed combination on the 23rd pair, using penis presence as an indicator is still 99.98% accurate, more accurate than the vast majority of disease diagnostic tests we use, like the flu or COVID tests.</p>

<p>Not to mention, as complicated as the gender thing might be, some experts will indeed argue that there are only two genders.  Are they bigots?</p>

        <p>I'll be very honest and admit that i am not very well educated on the matter so excuse me if i sound harsh,insensitive or anything as it is not my intention and english not being my first langage doesn't help but i fail to see the meme as transphobic. I thought that being transphobic had something to do with fear ? Phobic as a phobia ? </p>
<p>Or that it could apply to people who are being discriminatory (for jobs for example) or violent/hateful towards transgender people ? What is considered transphobic and what is not ?</p>
<p>I thought that gender is for the expected roles such as women in the kitchen and men at work and that sex is the physical reality. But the meme speak about genders. </p>
<p>So transpeople transition to the other sex with treatments and to another gender too ? </p>
<p>As you can probably tell i am very confused but i am genuinely trying to understand.</p>

        <p>It’s all good, you’re trying to understand it, that’s better than what a majority of people do. </p>
<p>It’s essentially the “100 genders” idea. People want to push the idea that gender is sex, (a simple google of the definition of “gender” and “sex” contradicts this) and that they can only be one or the other. The whole meme is that they’re mocking what’s new, and saying it’s bad, like wearing 3 masks. And they’re implying that it’s all new and unnecessary, and these comments just show the mindset in it’s true glory. They’re just essentially claiming it isn’t real. Not sure if I explained it well enough, but that’s the basic idea.</p>
<p>And phobia is just a mess up in English, just another thing that contradicts itself. Most of the time, people like this don’t fear trans people, it’s more of just showing distaste or threatening physical action over a dislike or hate of them. It’s really just a form of prejudice. </p>
<p>And essentially, transpeople are just people who transition their gender or sex. Changing their gender is things like changing their name, presentation, pronouns, social things. Changing their sex is either the removal or addition of breasts or whatever else is physical, such as surgeries or taking hormones. Hope that clears it up a bit.</p>
<p>r/asktransgender would help you a lot, I think. Thanks for caring enough to look into it, means a lot.</p>

        <p>There's nothing transphobic about dissenting with social theorists. I treat transsexuals like I do anyone else, showing no undue disrespect or indignity. I see no weight to the theorists' arguments and believe that obsessing over sexual/gender norms and drawing ideals made up by a pedophile so he could abuse kids to be silly. They're a waste of time and we shouldn't store up our identities in fleeting social norms.</p>
