    <strong>Vaccines for teens? (reposted)</strong>
    <p><p><em>Reposting - original was removed, I think for lack of a flair?</em></p>
<p>As  you all know, they're allowing younger and younger people to get the  "vaccines." Here in North Carolina (everywhere?), they're now making it  available for 12-15 year olds, and of course my wife is gung-ho to get  our 15 year old jabbed. I told her I do not consent under any  circumstances, which led to some conflict, and to me doing some  additional research to bolster my case.</p>
<p>You  have to dig for it, but there's some unbelievable data out there. In my  case I was actually able to find the number of people under eighteen  who had died from Covid. In my state, that number is three.</p>
<p><a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/data-behind-dashboards">THREE</a>.</p>
<p>To put that into perspective, there are around 10.5 million people in NC, and <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/NC">22% of whom are under 18</a>. That works out to 2.3 million people under 18. And THREE have died of Covid.</p>
<p>I doubt this will persuade my wife, but at least it will buy me a few months before he turns 16, at which point the state says <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/verify/north-carolina-teenagers-covid-vaccine-parents-permission/275-31b0ebb6-85fa-4c46-b56e-81d839e3799a">he can get the jab without my approval</a>.</p>
<p>Crazy, crazy times.</p></p>

        <p>I'm sure it's 0, they almost certainly died <em>with</em> COVID and perhaps even just <em>with</em> a COVID false positive result... unless they were obscenely obese which is also possible.</p>
<p>Try get your child educated so they refuse it, if they can consent to get it they can consent to refuse it, right?</p>
<p>I would divorce a spouse over this.</p>

        <p>Please tell your wife that in three years your child who will then be an adult can make their own decision to take an experimental drug that isn’t even approved by the criminal FDA. Sorry but it makes me so upset to think that there are humans who won’t get to make their own decision.</p>

        <p>It's also pretty fucking creepy that the schools near me also recommends anybody over 18 to sign up to get the jab simply because they live close and are in a "high risk area". Fuck NO. Not taking that experimental shit. I'm not going to be tricked into "boarding the train". At least some students said "thank goodness I'm less than 18"which shows some resistance.</p>

        <p>In my country (Scotland), there has been a total of 22 deaths altogether in my age group of 35-39 year olds since the start of the pandemic. 14 guys and 8 woman.</p>
<p>I have more chance of being hit by a bus than dying from covid. Better ban buses I suppose to protect us.</p>

        <p>If you've got about 5 minutes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n9xeow/i_feel_bad_for_them/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>go to this reddit post</strong></a>, and perhaps show your wife this.
