        <p>The scariest revelation from all this for me is that you don't need to. People are so stupid, the media can tell them "don't wear masks" one week and "masks are the one thing standing between us and certain death" the next and they just buy it.</p>

        <p>That is the scariest part of all this. The constant contradictions, flip-flopping by "top officials", and shifting goal posts (what happened to "2 weeks to flatten the curve"?), blatant lies and corruption left right and centre, changing the focus to sensationalizing case count as deaths/hospitalizations absolutely crater after the peak months ago, and somehow people just eat it all right up, their "opinion" which isn't their own opinion at all, in total lockstep with the headlines as they come out.</p>
<p>That honestly makes me despair for humanity.</p>
<p>Here in my city, there is a debate now going on about making masks mandatory because other cities have started doing it. Pretty much nothing happened here (under 30 deaths in a city of 1.5 million over the past 6-7 months), our test-positivity rate is extremely low at 0.8%, I could go on and on. I wrote our local representative to express my views, provide a few links and urge them to consider a rational approach based on the real data, but unsurprisingly I never got a response. Fully expecting them to mandate masks now even though it doesn't really make sense to, the consent has been successfully manufactured.</p>

        <p>I've spent the last 20 years selling and studying air filtration and air movement in the HVAC industry. I have the equivalent experience as a PhD that's been practicing for 15 years in air treatment and filtration and when I try to tell people that these masks will not stop a virus and will never protect them from a virus they tell me I don't know shit because I'm a musician..  ok ..  that's like telling a plumber he doesn't know water drainage or telling an electrician he doesn't know amperage and wire sizing.. but let's believe the doctors because they're experts in air filtration even though they've spent their entire lives studying their specialization area of the human body ..  the only way to stop the spread of a virus is to sterilize it so it can no longer reproduce inside your body .. ultraviolet lights and building your natural immunities are the only way to stop the spread of a virus. These masks do absolutely nothing to stop or slow a virus. People say it's supposed to stop the droplets .. well the average mask only stops 44% of these droplets and everything below 0.3 microns in size goes right through the mask and around it.. </p>
<p>TLDR: doctors know everything so don't believe the actual experts ..</p>

        <p>Lol, because that is how science works.  As new information is made available, you <em>should</em> adjust recommendations. Most normal people are <em>hoping</em> for a new recommendation from the scientific and medical community at large that says "no need to wear masks." No one enjoys wearing them; you don't have a monopoly on dislike of masks...</p>

        <p>I don't disagree with any of your points.  But.  It's a pandemic involving a respiratory illness.  Once the availability of ppe was high enough, proceeding with an "err on the side of caution" was the prudent recommendation.  </p>
<p>I provided you with the information you requested, and if you choose to discard it because it doesn't fit your worldview - it's your choice. But there are enough medical experts who advocate for them to outweigh the few who don't, in my opinion.  </p>
<p>I hate wearing a mask.  I avoid going places where I'll be required to wear one.  But I do it anyway, because I trust the current experts to be... More of an expert than me, and I value the life of my wife and kids.</p>

        <p>You can feel however you want about "anti mask people," but it's totally outside the scope of this discussion.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, the surgeon general tweeted out "Masks do NOT stop the spread of coronavirus among the general public" (his caps). Many people incorrectly assume that A) We had evidence of this, and B) We observed new evidence that overturned our old evidence. </p>
<p>Neither of those are true.</p>

        <p>Its really not when you're just being a bitch about wearing a mask lol, at first antimask people were being openly bigoted against those who chose to for no reason, now that your groups in the minority and is being treated the same its time play victim and shut down conversation berating you for being openly retarded by choice, legitimately why would you go out of your way not to wear one when its so easy and the worst it will do is nothing (but it will help stop the spread) where as your method can at worst cause a death. You just don't like being told what to do? </p>
<p>Theirs tons of evidence masks work if you're not actively trying find evidence to the contrary.</p>

        <p>Im on mobile but I have translated pdfs on my phone from China from January I believe? Saying the things other countries have slowly found out at first I was super skeptical about the validity but after italy had the same articles coming out I was less.</p>
<p>Regardless how can you say its unsubstantiated? Because im not providing easily found links?</p>
<p>As I said im on mobile and I domt really know how to fuck with all that yet, just look it up on Google lol find 30 articles a second. It works both ways but real doctors and professionals are saying these things as opposed to whoever says opposite.</p>

        <p>The scariest thing here is saying people who wear masks don't have critical thinking but anti-maskers do. Truly mind-blowing!!</p>
<p>You could, for instance, look to examples outside of the US that show that wearing masks has significantly reduced the spread of the virus and subsequently kept the numbers of deaths down. </p>
<p>Or you can continue to get hysterical about "ma rights!!" and let the thing continue running rampant through your country. </p>
<p>The entire world is watching your shit-show in absolute disbelief, apart from maybe Brazil cos they're also run by a complete moron.</p>

        <p>It's almost as if people don't understand the scientific process... That there are many false starts and bad forks in the road, and as new information is made available, recommendations change.  Unlike religion, which follows books that were written thousands of years ago and you're expected to adhere to them regardless of how society has changed around you.</p>
<p>It definitely shows how much you understand about the scientific method when you shit on changes that upset your little bubble.</p>

This is also when we thought the death rate could have been higher.</p>

        <p>I read that the toilet paper thing was due to psychological panic people felt where they didn’t know what to do and had no control so bought all the toilet paper. This in turn made it a scarce commodity and caused more people to hoard.</p>

There was a single digit number of dishwashing liquid on the shelf at the store. Still no disinfectant wipes anywhere, and what does come in gets wiped (haha I’m so funny) out in a few minutes.</p>

        <p>This shows how fucking nonsensical science is.
First, they say the general public shouldn’t wear masks because they would deplete the supply from front line health providers. Then supply of masks increases and NOW it’s ok to wear a mask based on more evidence that it helps limit the spread of disease?!
I fucking call BULL SHIT on that. “New Evidence” might as well be the same as learning more information and basing new policy on that “New Evidence”
What the fuck ever, libs. By your “reasoning” we should adjust our behaviors every time we learn something new and want to change things for the better. Nice try but try again.</p>
