    <strong>I’m having a hard time deciding if I still want children at this point.</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been with my fiancé for five years and we’re getting married in February. We’ve always wanted children but decided to wait until I was out of school and we were married. Now that we’re so close to marriage, we’ve really started talking about a baby again and now my opinion has changed a bit. I know he’s worried too.</p>
<p>I guess there’s really never a “right” time to have a baby but right now seems scary. With all this vaccine stuff and the lockdowns and all this, I’m rethinking it. I don’t want to bring a baby into this world if they’re going to suffer. At the same time I think we should have one now before a vaccine is potentially mandatory and could make us sterile or sick.</p>
<p>He’s getting older too, he’s forty and fifteen years older than me so he wants to make a baby sooner than later. I don’t have any worries about money since he has a very good salary. My worries are about where the world is headed. I hope we can all go back to normal but I’m losing hope every day. I’m sure we’ll end up having a baby but I’m more concerned now.</p></p>

        <p>We had our first baby right before the pandemic hit. There is no “right” time to have a baby. </p>
<p>Just make sure you have support people who can help out. That’s the most important thing. The first year can be VERY difficult depending on the child’s temperament and sleep cycle.</p>

        <p>It is very much a personal choice.
For me, I personally don't have children and I'm so happy right now that I don't.</p>
<p>Looking back at my childhood, growing up the freedom and fun, being able to play outside, just the little things.</p>
<p>For me a child growing up without any of these choices isn't something I want. The way the world is with safety, the planet dying, the rules..I don't know..it's not a nice place right now.</p>
<p>Have you thought to maybe wait another year or so and see how things are then?</p>

        <p>Why will his life be 'very hard now'? If anything it will get easier as we finally realize that we are moving to a world of infinite abundance and automation of base tasks.</p>
<p>If anything, we are moving towards Star Trek world, something that too many people over 60 do not want to acknowledge.</p>

        <p>Children are a personal choice, and you can never know what's coming. I've got 4 kids while almost all of my personal friends have none. Those of my friends who do have kids are vastly older (12+) than mine as well (0, 3, 6. And 9). Theres no way to know the future and you know you best. </p>
<p>You WILL be criticized for having and not having kids by everyone your whole life. My children are amazing and I'd do anything for them, but I completely understand that they're not for everyone. Please dont be pressured into making a choice beyond you and your significant other, however. </p>
<p>You can only do you and your best.
While i dont think things will get better soon, I can do my best to keep them happy and safe. Cant do any less.</p>

        <p>If you wants a child, but avoid feeling you put someone into existence in a dystopian world you can adopt. The children already exist, so you're not the cause of their existence and you may help homeless ones.</p>
<p>There's never a right time to have children because of none knows in advance how the future would be like. Having children is always a gamble. Either you risk it or you don't, depending on your choice. It all depends on how much you personally think the risks are worth it.</p>
<p>Some value safety, other value what they sees as exciting choices - but with risks.</p>
