    <strong>A new trend I'm noticing... has anyone else seen this?</strong>
    <p><p>So several members of my family have all had covid at this point including my aging parents. Everyone was fine within a week. The most severe symptoms in my 70 year old mom was that she complained like she had a bad cold. My father said "he just felt a bit under the weather". The other cases in my family range from entirely asymptomatic and only found out because of a mandated test to one person having a bit of a cough and also only finding out because of a test for work. </p>
<p>When I discuss this with people I would describe as "doomers" there is almost a palpable sense of anger when they ask how those family members are doing and I just say back "oh they're all fine. They were fine within about a week." </p>
<p>I get the distinct impression that they actively want people to be suffering from this so they can justify their behavior instead of just being like "oh yeah it was like a cold I'm fine now".</p></p>

Do you realize that virtually all the people who die have some underlying condition? Most of the people who die have at least 3 co-morbidities.</p>

        <p>100% - this is fun for them. The world being on the brink of apocalypse is exciting.</p>
<p>I know, because I felt it too. Early March, it had been 6 months since my gf left me. I was trying to get back into dating and not succeeding yet. It was getting depressing, lonely, boring. And then this hit, and suddenly my body went into a type of survival mode where I didn't care anymore that I wasn't dating, and it was actually relieving to an extent that I had a new, "greater threat" to worry about.</p>
<p>Things are much better for me now. But for those still lonely, of course they want every else to suffer too.</p>

        <p>Some do. A lot of the people pushing this just want to be praised as "heroes" for staying home and playing video games. Or they like exerting authority on others by yelling at them to put on a mask and snitching on them for breaking the "rules". The government are a part of why this is continuing, but the rest is the petty, selfish agendas of individuals.</p>

        <p>Actually there are exceptions but the majority of viruses become weaker as they spread. This is because less severe mutations don't make people too sick so they still go out and infect others, while more severe mutations get obviously sick and stay home and don't transmit it.</p>

        <p>That only happens when sick people stay home. When an illness can be spread before symptoms develop (and that person is able to go about their life normally) there is no guarantee the virus will mutate that way. It could just as easily mutate to become more severe.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread are very rare, last i read they were allegedly responsible for about 0.7% of cases, but that could also be explained by false positives, so if asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission does exist then it is very rare. Even fauci himself said that historically it's asymptomatic individuals who cause the spread of respiratory viruses</p>

        <p>Severely sick people will always stay home more than lightly sick people. Both can transmit it before symptoms, but only one kind can transmit after. Yes individual cases may mutate to be more or less severe but on the aggregate from millions of cases the less severe ones will spread more</p>

        <p>You’re assuming they’re equally contagious . Which isn’t always case since that can mutate as well. That’s the big issue wtih minks catching covid.  It looks like its changing the spike protein. A mutation there could change how easy/hard it is for us to catch it and could also make the current vaccine worthless. </p>
<p>The issue isn’t that what he said might happen. The issue is that this person threw out half the picture on a public radio show. If you’re choosing to bank on that one possibility happening then good for you, but there are other ways it could mutate and you need to be aware of that when you’re trying to aim for natural herd immunity.</p>

<p>But yes, the spike protein changing is a big issue. It’s not an issue <em>yet</em> but the wrong random mutation and that vaccine we’ve been working on becomes useless. It also changes how our naturally developed antibodies recognize the virus which could lead to re-infections. </p>

        <p>It’s not either or. There are other factors that can affect disease severity: co-morbidity, gender (being male is a major risk factor), ethnicity, genes (this seems to be playing a big part due to autoantibodies for interferons and partly why being male might be a risk factor for severe disease because it’s X linked), and initial viral load (also a big player and masks really help to reduce this).</p>

        <p>But his initial point still stands nobody wants to hear about others getting better. When they do hear about any positive signs of this virus, it’s immediately met with anger or skepticism. That tells you all you need to know about the direction they’re trying to push it.

        <p>As I said before, a virus mutates randomly. Typically yes, they become less lethal but that’s not guaranteed especially if people are able to spread the virus before showing symptoms. If people can spread the lethal virus as well as the less lethal virus then there’s no selection for it to become less lethal.</p>

        <p>I made literally this same comment on r/coronavirus without realizing which sub I was on. My comment was auto deleted for inciting incivilty and violence. I then made the same verbatim comment only replacing "doomers" with "vultures", the comment is still up.</p>

        <p>People are telling friends and family, but it isn't a shocking story so it doesn't get shared like the ventilator stories. Just like the newspaper adage, "If it bleeds, it leads." Bobby needing to stay in bed for a few days isn't newsworthy. Bobby needing ventilators and resuscitation gets more clicks.</p>

        <p>I have a coworker that’s a total doomer, constantly telling people to pull their mask over their nose and always spraying everything and basically looking terrified of the world and everything in it. We have had over 90 cases since a year ago and so far no one has died. At first when they would announce a case this guy just knew we were all going to die, and when someone in our department caught it he actually wanted to clean out the guys desk as if we would never see him again. Fast forward to a year later and I’ve known at least twenty people that have had it and the worst case was like a flu and they were better in a few days, but my coworker still walks around with a mask of fear and every time there’s another case he says we should just shut back down ( leaving over 500  people jobless) for a bad cold</p>

        <p>Yep I live in a province of 4.3+ million people. We've had 844 "covid deaths" in the whole province since March. The average age of covid death here is 83. 75% of covid deaths here have 3 OR MORE comorbidities. Yet everyone still losing their shit and begging for lockdowns. Thanks to them all gatherings are banned and everything other than retail and grocery stores is shut down again. It's ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Yep... So we're doing this all in the name of "protecting" people who were probably going to die soon anyway. And causing them to live in isolation and loneliness that they don't want. It makes so much sense. 🤪</p>

        <p>Yes, and it's sad. People are caught in a position where they NEED to see people hurt and killed by c0vid, otherwise their doomerism and pro-authority behaviors would be unjustified. It's really hard to swallow the pill of realizing you were ready to throw fellow Americans under the bus based on fear mongering over a little cold bug.</p>

        <p>The wrath is palpable when you tell them the truth: It was no big deal.    </p>
<p>I also love telling them I won't need the vaccine - I've had it already,  everyone in my family had it already, and yeah. It was no big deal.  The worst part was lingering fatigue and just enough weakness for a couple of weeks that I couldn't get on my big mare without getting her on low ground, and then it was a struggle.</p>

        <p>As a former doomer, the psychology is pretty straightforward. They want people to suffer so that others are forced to "take the virus seriously". Thus, their mental model of the world is correct and they win the argument, which is more important than anything else, even human lives. </p>
<p>I'm ashamed to have ever had this thought process, but the experience was more like being demonically possessed than anything rational.</p>

        <p>I had a similar situation. We are mexican and kept the family parties going. Have several small outbreaks in multiple families, including myself. Most did not even get sick. Others lost taste. Even one who is elderly with underlying conditions was fine. I probably had it the worst with bad flu like symptoms but nothing life threatening. Also no one has long covid19.</p>

        <p>That’s the majority of cases, asymptomatic or just like your regular seasonal respiratory virus.  I work at a SoCal hospital where it feels like 90% of the covid admissions are Latino.  From what I gather, the whole family gets it, and usually the only people that get admitted are very obese or have uncontrolled diabetes.</p>

        <p>I'm definitely not saying the virus isn't real or that it hasn't killed anyone, but I'm noticing more and more that the mass majority of people don't really get affected by the virus... I now know of 3 people who were COMPLETELY asymptomatic, as in they weren't even aware they had the virus the entire time they had it.

        <p>Haha, yes. Our household was positive for covid and we made a point of telling people, just to show everyone how it's not a big deal. We had all kind of doomers reaching out with their condolences. One called us and opened with "OH MY GOD, I AM SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR TERRIBLE NEWS!" It took us a second to even clue into what she was talking about.</p>
<p>We found out that a lot of people were really scared. But we kept telling everyone who mundane it was, and I think we converted some folks. The media has been trying so hard to scare people for so long, it's no wonder some have really bought in.</p>

        <p>Depression and mental illness is nothing I wish on anyone, but we also need to look at the larger picture. Did they already have mental illness previously? There have been over a million people that have died from the virus within one year and more people that have contracted it, but still have multiple lingering issues. If we're going to talk about lives cut early then why not talk about the children that have died from organ failures caused by the virus? Those deaths are tragic, I agree, but using them to play on emotions isn't the best way to go about it. Food shortages seem to be effecting those countries that were already dealing with shortages and require aid. How well does a malnourished immune system do against a virus? Not well. Why would we then risk bringing in another pathogen that would cause worse harm? Things are fucked and they're not going to get better if we keep doing the things that cause the spread.</p>

        <p>I’m glad your family recovered quickly and without anyone needing to be seen in the hospital.  I want people to survive this virus and I am so happy that we have treatments to help those at risk of severe disease hopefully avoid the need for hospitalization.  But not everyone is that lucky.  So, don’t forget to keep those in the hospital with COVID in your prayers and those families who have lost a loved one. I agree that most people survive but please be kind to others, especially those who lost someone they loved.  It’s easy to say mean things online, but remember to be kind even when it’s not cool.</p>

        <p>No because I understand statistics. One death is a tragedy for the family that is affected but we don't shut down society to prevent every kind of harm from happening. And with an IFR of 0.24% where the median age of death is actually above the normal life expectancy COVID isn't a risk that warrants the response we've seen. It warrants hand washing, not touching your face, and not going to incredibly crowded indoor spaces. And that's about it. </p>
<p>You know what happened in 2018? We had a monster flu season that killed 61,000 Americans in the span of about 3 months and almost all of them were under 65. And in the UK that same flu season there were 65,000 deaths in the UK from all causes and flu accounted for 1 in 3 of those deaths. But you didn't even know that did you? Because the media didn't use every second of airspace to tell you to be absolutely terrified of a flu that was killing close to 700 people a day. </p>
<p>If you actually crunch the numbers on covid risk, if you are under the age of 70 and not morbidly obese it carries the same risk as commuting to work. </p>
<p>And that's before we even begin to consider the second and third order effects of these disastrous lockdowns. </p>
<p><a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/hairdresser-24-dies-by-suicide-during-coronavirus-shutdown-062337115.html">Do you care about Alysson Jadin</a> who lost anywhere from 50-60 years of what could have been a productive and fruitful life? She killed herself after her countries lockdowns bankrupted her business and left her with nothing with no social safety net to keep her going. </p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/03/california-boy-dies-after-shooting-himself-during-zoom-class/">Do you care about Adan Llanos</a> He was just a boy and he shot himself in front of his classmates on Zoom because of mental health issues caused by lockdowns and virtual learning.</p>
<p>And these stories aren't unique. In the US alone they are predicting 100,000 suicides which they are calling "deaths of despair" because of these exact same situations. </p>
<p>Again just in the in the US alone 8 million people have been pushed below the poverty line and globally that number is 100 million. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.foodsecurityportal.org/blog/sharp-increase-food-insecurity-because-covid-19-says-global-food-crises-report-update">135 million people will face food insecurity</a> because of covid restrictions. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/25/pandemic-pushes-hundreds-millions-people-toward-starvation-poverty/">Without immediate aide they are predicting up to 30 million people could die of starvation in the developing world</a> </p>
<p>These lockdowns are also creating a mental health crisis the likes of which no one alive today in the developed world has experienced. Depression rates among people under 18 are hovering around 50% in some countries with rates of depression among adults skyrocketing to 70%. </p>
<p>I have personally had to talk a friend down from suicide because the effects of being continually locked down by the governor of her state has mentally destroyed her and almost broken up her marriage. </p>
<p>And now we come to the future. Financial experts and economists are warning that we may have permanently crippled multiple generations. The working class will never recover from this. What little savings they already had are gone and they will now face an economic landscape where climbing the ladder is almost certainly off the table. </p>
<p>And for the younger millennials and zoomers they now face a lifetime of economic uncertainty and hardship because they are going to be paying back the enormous public debt that has been generated at local, state, and federal levels. </p>
<p>All in a misguided attempt to prevent anyone coming to any kind of harm. </p>
<p>And I could keep going and going citing more things like the fact that PCR testing was never designed to diagnose disease and the creator of the PCR test said it was inappropriate to use them to that end because if you run too many cycles you can simply get the result you want. And for an example of that go see what happened in Austria recently. An MP ran a PCR test in parliament and his can of coke came back positive. This is a data scandal that will go down in history as one of the biggest blunders ever. </p>
<p>And governments are abusing covid to pad statistics. They treat deaths from covid and deaths WITH covid as the exact same thing in the statistics. So (a real example) if you die from falling off a roof but you test positive with covid you're a covid death. If you die because you are 87 and have cancer but you have covid, you're a covid death. The way deaths are compiled is so unreliable and so muddied that I can't even give you an accurate estimate of how many people have actually died OF covid. </p>
<p>The failure to assess risk, inciting mass panic among the populace, and introducing draconian restrictions on movement, commerce and even speech is pushing us towards a very dark future. </p>
<p>And I'm not saying all of this simply to be contrarian. If we had a pandemic that was actually deadly I would be taking every precaution I could think of. If something like the Spanish flu actually came back I would be sheltering in place without a hint of dissent because it indiscriminately killed 3-4% of the populations it infected and those deaths were overwhelmingly children and working age people. And I would be doing everything in my power to protect my children from that harm. But that isn't what COVID is. </p>
<p>Our response could have been to provide PPE, sanitation equipment, and aide to nursing homes, aged care facilities, and for people who are immunocompromised and we didn't do that. We directed all of our energy into creating as much hysteria and panic as possible while throwing tens of millions out of work. </p>
<p>And that is a legacy we will spend decades trying to reverse the damage from.</p>

        <p>You know, back in the before-time, pre covid, we used to have deaths in the family all the time, from all sorts of things. A lot of people don't know about this because it was so long ago, but it's true.</p>

        <p>Ah I remember it like 'twas yesterday. Nobody had a clue why we are here and death was the only thing guaranteed in life.
Now we still don't have a fucking clue but we're also guaranteed mandates and restrictions from the overlords.</p>
