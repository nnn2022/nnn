        <p>What utter lunatic out there would feel that their freedoms are being infringed upon because they can't directly touch a power line and dangerously send several Amps of current through their vital organs? How about the lunatics that feel their freedoms are being infringed upon because they need to wear a seat belt? See, there's a difference between directly touching a power line, something that's certainly dangerous and requires absolutely zero "science" to justify, and forcing the world to go into lockdown while wearing dirty, grimy, crappily sewn-together masks that are so infrequently worn as they should be that they might as well never be worn to begin with.</p>
<p>This is a pretty common method that they use to make anti-lockdown people appear moronic in every way possible. Yeah, I get it's a "harmless" meme, but it makes people even more hostile towards the idea of ever reopening any time soon, because they think the only people who believe it are mouth breathers. It makes the future without COVID-19 appear so much more distant, not because it's spreading more, but because these Reddit freaks are so opposed to the idea of reopening that they'd gladly refute any removal of lockdowns for years if it meant their hermetic lifestyle could be globally accepted and replicated.</p>
<p>We love to think that we're past the age of superstitious thinking, such as when Plague Doctors believed that aromatic incense could combat the Black Plague so long as you never smelt the stench of rotting flesh from the virus's dead victims. The truth is that we engage in as much superstitious thinking as we did back then. In fact, we probably engage in more dangerous superstitious thinking today than we did back then, because today's superstitions are now supposedly "backed by science", regardless of how valid and correct that "science" is, making it more appealing to the naive ones among us.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, that's another term that doomer Redditors have used as of recently: "backed by science". As if most Redditors had even a modicum of interest in science before this virus taught them that some people will believe anything so long as "science" is slapped in front of it, and as if the things they claim are "backed by science" are actually backed by science in the first place. Taking advice on what "science says" from a Redditor is like taking advice on emotional well-being from a psychopath. It's so subject to their personal twisting and scrutiny that it can't be trusted.</p>
<p>And for people who call us "Karens" so often, they sure love to act like them all the time on Reddit behind the veil of anonymity. Wasn't the whole point of the Karen meme to poke fun at people who tried controlling others' lives and making people's lives miserable for silly things that most people wouldn't typically care about, like people who always want to "talk to the manager" of a restaurant whenever things don't go their way? Since when was THAT associated with anti-lockdown people? Don't tell me that Redditors actually believe that sheltering children, teens and adults indoors for years like they're slobbering infants ISN'T a big deal!</p>
<p>Basically, typical Reddit behavior exemplified right here. It's an amount of mythic thinking hysteria that I can only compare to the panic after 9/11. At this point, I think they're beyond even the point of "working for authority" as some people on this subreddit claim. They're wanting these lockdowns entirely for themselves, and at this point, even if the CDC and WHO announced tomorrow that everything could go back to normal, they would refuse to integrate into normal society once again unless it was part of their terrifying vision of a "new normal", because apparently, the best way to move past a virus is to have it influence our lives for the next thousand or so years despite it probably being less deadly than the flu.</p>

        <p>Yeah well, not wearing a hard hat or going near a power line or not wearing a respirator means you could die or get seriously injured or sick in those situations. Not wearing a mask when you don’t have symptoms of an illness that has a 99% survival rate can’t even compare.</p>

        <p>The only one on the list that is a reasonable comparison is seatbelt laws. Which, by the by, are also morally wrong and infringe on other's freedom. Forcing me to wear safety equipment by government edict is flat out wrong on every level. I don't need to be told what clothes to wear and when to wear them, period, even if the government says it's good for me.</p>

        <p>Nah man you wear the seatbelt to prevent you from launching out your windshield and through another person's windshield and impaling someone else. Its like wearing a mask, you wear it to protect others. Simple as that.</p>

        <p>I almost always wear a seatbelt but I will sometimes put around the block or whatever without.  I also ride a motorcycle where there are no seatbelts so you become more cognizant of protecting yourself via situational awareness as opposed to hoping everyone else follows driving rules.</p>
