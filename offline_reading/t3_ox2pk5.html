    <strong>Is there a difference between "immune" and "asymptomatic"?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not sure how the language evolved (though I have some ideas), but I'm wondering if it's possible to shift the nomenclature from "asymptomatic" to "immune".  Especially after the rollout of inoculations, with immunity being the supposed end goal, I'd think that measuring the "immunity" of a population would be the preferred parlance, over its "asymptomatic-ness".  Maybe especially so, since it's my "immune system" doing all of the hard work and not my "asymptomatic system".</p>
<p>So please, before breaking down to your doomer brothers and sisters why you don't need a mask in the grocery store checkout, kindly explain to them, "I'm immune!".</p>
<p>But I'm a dummy.  Maybe they're two different things and I'm just spoutin'.</p></p>

        <p>Immune means you cannot catch the illness</p>
<p>Asymptomatic means you have it but it does not manifest itself or cause issues</p>

        <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic people are why we  locked down and required masks, but now that some vaccinated people are supposed to be asymptomatic, asymptomatic is considered to be a good thing.</p>

        <p>Asymptotic means you’re not showing symptoms of an illness whether you have it or not. </p>
<p>Immune means you can’t get an illness for whatever reason. </p>
<p>Very different things</p>

        <p>No, you are on to something.  Or would be, if words were immutable like they used to be.  Nowadays words that used to mean something that everyone understood are quickly changed by the trio (MSM, Big Tech and Government) to mean whatever they want them to mean.</p>
<p>Immune and immunity are good examples, particularly herd immunity.  That was changed to mean levels of vaccination.</p>
<p>Vaccine and vaccination definitions have changed too.</p>
<p>Look up Rules for Radicals and controlling language.  Glad you are pushing back.</p>
