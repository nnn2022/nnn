        <p>Of course, obviously.  An expert says a couple more cases in 100,000 people and most of this might be due to the fact that wherever there is a spike, they immediately do more testing and hence find some more cases...</p>
<p>Of course they maskers will jump on this to say masks are working, but maybe there is some hope in this info being on one of the main UK sites.  Maybe if enough coverage is given to the fact people aren't dying in the streets and spilling out of the hospitals, our case will grow!</p>

        <p>The journalist -- Nick Triggle -- has been one of the few voices within the BBC writing measured analysis pieces on the pandemic. (Sadly the BBC as a whole has been as guilty as any other mainstream outlet in stoking hysteria from the beginning.)</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53579731">key piece Triggle wrote recently</a> made the case that there is no "second wave" happening, just clusters of infections that are a ripple effect of the first wave.</p>
<p>edit: What's frustrating is that none of the experts quoted in either article are actually featured on BBC televised news or radio blurbs, nor are their views deemed worthy of emphatic headlines, homepage presence, or news alerts. Given that most people consume the news as soundbites, this makes it difficult for a more rational, sceptical narrative to take hold.</p>
