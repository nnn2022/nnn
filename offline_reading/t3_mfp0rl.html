    <strong>I’m not taking the vaccine unless you hand out Xanax with it.</strong>
    <p><p>Been suffering from an untreated mental illness for almost two decades. Every time I tell a medical professional they don’t wanna hear it. “Just try to think more positively”</p>
<p>You get mad at me when I don’t tell you I have a panic attack problem and end up in your floor but when I do tell you upfront you look at me like, “why are you telling me this?”</p>
<p>So you won’t be surprised when I hit the deck, ass hole!</p>
<p>Can’t afford not to be treated(weather I want to or not)for a pussy corona virus. </p>
<p>I guess we are bold face throwing the mentally ill under the bus for our own security because if some people are at risk of a corona virus than some people are at risk of a year long lockdown. </p>
<p>It’s not one life is too many than and it doesn’t have to be either or. Society could realize they are putting a different group at risk and than make sure to create help and a safety net for that group.</p>
<p>TLDR If you gave me Xanax with my vaccine it would suggest to me that perhaps you are actually trying to help. That you are actually interested in saving human lives. But if the medical world won’t acknowledge my illness than I’m not going to acknowledge your pussy virus. GFY! </p>
<p>And maybe it’s my illness that makes me incapable of believing in a corona virus but that just means that it’s now your problem too. You didn’t ever try to help. You deserve me running around crazy.</p></p>

        <p>I too have anxiety and have had panic attacks so totally I get it, I actually used to take Xanax but I stopped because I didn’t like the side effects and dependency aspects. Same reason I stopped taking ADHD medication, I would rather just deal with who God made me if that makes sense (even though I’m not really religious.)</p>
<p>There are other reasons to not take this vaccine aside from your (totally understandable) distrust in the medical establishment. I recommend looking into it. But at the end of the day, make your own choices.</p>

        <p>One hundred percent agree, no one has ever given a shit about me in the medical establishment have only wasted my time and gave me nothing in return yet I'm supposed to trust them on a vaccine for absolutely no reason at all jabbed into my arm just because there is apparently some virus that in well over a year now I can find no evidence even exists? Some people got the common cold, that's about it. I'm not seeing people dropping dead, I don't know anyone out of the many I do know that have died from it that is likely to be manipulated statistic anyways to get those death counts up, and somehow death from everything else just disappeared? This is one sneaky, intelligent virus! I been unmasked and living life as normal as I can at least to keep my head on this entire time but I guess every time I went out was just a lucky run and I just narrowly avoided it every time! It's so weird, it's like everyone else has just been narrowly avoiding it too!  This may be a joke but it's not funny anymore.</p>

        <p>No offense but this makes no sense with what I've experienced personally, and seen other people say happens to them.</p>
<p>Most of the time, doctors hand out anti-anxiety meds like candy. Yes, they often do give the "Just try to think more positively" spiel though they then give you a prescription for whatever drugs you want. Xanax is actually what is often suggested I take even though I refuse it because I had a negative reaction to it when I took it long ago. (And before I inevitably get assholes in here who're like "LOL! YOU GOT SIDE EFFECTS FROM <strong>XANAX</strong>! STFU! XANAX DOESN'T HAVE THOSE", I'd like to say you're hypocrites because this is the same shit people say about the vaccines.)</p>

        <p>Xanax definitely has side affects. Did someone argue that it doesn’t? It’s quite a powerful substance that should not be disrespected. </p>
<p>I do see a lot of people getting Xanax that seem to have less issues than me. I don’t know why the medical world insists on excluding me until they want to treat me for a corona. </p>
<p>I desperately needed an advocate for years. Doctors want me out of their office before I entered. Are you Canadian? They usually don’t even come into the room and point their eyes in my general direction. </p>
<p>I’m like, I’m depressed and I don’t care if I die anymore and they respond, “la la la, can’t hear you la la la”</p>

        <p>I could have this entire vaccine delivered in 2 weeks. I'd conscript every sex worker on the planet. "Get a poke, give a poke". Who's with me?!</p>
