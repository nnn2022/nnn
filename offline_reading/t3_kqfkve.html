    <strong>Moving back in with my parents because of my terrified roommates.</strong>
    <p><p>At the beginning of the pandemic, we were all on the same page. It was new and scary, wore masks and gloves everywhere, I even had a panic attack because I ate an edible and started getting paranoid about any of us getting it. </p>
<p>As time went on, I was blessed with being able to see what was really going on and they fell deeper into fear. The one who is pregnant just got the vaccine because she was scared that Covid would kill her or the baby. They’ve been isolating because of cases being so high and, since their jobs can be done from home, it was easy for them. I work in a restaurant and have a second gig as a personal assistant, so in order to pay rent, I have to be out in the scary big world. </p>
<p>Keeping them in mind, I decided to not go out to the city on NYE and instead opted for a small gathering at a friends house. They knew about this a couple days in advance, but it wasn’t until I’d left the house for the night that they called and told me they felt uncomfortable about it. “We don’t know where they’ve been or who they’ve been exposed to. You guys will be drinking and not wearing masks. It’s just that staying out that late means more time for exposure. But we don’t want to control what you do or change your plans, we will just have to isolate in the house from each other.” </p>
<p>So I went to my party, because who knows what kinds of restrictions they’ll come up with by next year. And for the last couple days I’ve been confined to my room, eating meals in here, I even wear my mask if we are in common areas just to be funny at first, but when I realized it made them happy, my stomach turned. </p>
<p>Today they told me that one of their moms has a fever and even though we haven’t seen her since Christmas, we should be glad we are isolating. </p>
<p>I set plans in motion with my family on Saturday to move me out at the end of the month and I’m telling them tonight. No lease, so I don’t have to worry about that. Just looking forward to being around people who aren’t paralyzed in fear.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I totally advised against it until the baby was born. But I came home one day and she said she got it. Her doctor recommended it because Covid was more likely to kill her than the vaccine.</p>

        <p>A woman of child-bearing age has no worries about Covid.  We have the data to know pregnant women and infants are not high risk, and are in fact very low risk.  That vaccine should be used for the elderly who actually need it.</p>
<p>Elderly also don't need to worry about long term side effects (which have, obviously, never been tested) because, obviously, they won't be alive to worry about long term anyway.  A baby, however, has a lifetime to see what this science project will bring.</p>
<p>But this is all logic, and seems like the smarter you are, the less you are able to do logic in the presence of fear, either fear of the virus, or fear of looking like a "bigot".</p>

        <p>Man that sucks.  I am so glad my roommate feels the same as we all do here.  She's been wonderful!  We've had friends over and we've gone out and we've had fun.  If I had to live with your roommates, they'd have killed me in my sleep by now if they didn't move out first.  I have lost friends and family over this because I flat out refuse to even pretend to be worried about covid.  I won't mask up for people and I won't give up on life for these people.</p>

        <p>Of my friends, the ones who've been sheltered at home working from home, on furlough etc are the ones who are the most scared. Myself, my partner and other friends and family have been working and living in the real world watching people lose their jobs, losing our jobs and working without PPE and not getting ill. </p>
<p>The people exposed to the outside world are the ones who are seeing it for what it is. Retired people and people working from home who only see everything online are the ones buying into the fear. Go outside. Breathe the fresh air. Live in the moment.  And you'll see that's its all just fear mongering</p>
