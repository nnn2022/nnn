    <strong>What can we expect, come the fall/winter seasons? What can the unvaccinated do to protect their rights?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m honestly frightened by the inevitable second wave of vaccination propaganda we are going to experience.  I believe it will be pushed even stronger this time around. </p>
<p>I am unvaccinated and I end up having to lie to my family, friends and even my workplace just to get by and be accepted.  It feels horrible!  Why do I have to feel this way?  I question every day if my job could look up in some database to see if I’m lying and just fire me.  This is AWFUL!  </p>
<p>What can we do?  What can the unvaccinated do to continue living a semi normal life?  I want to go to concerts this fall and I know they will have the vaccine card checks.  This is insanity.</p></p>

        <p>I worry a lot about this too, I am in New York City and I am surrounded by lunatics. Every day there's a new regulation or something that targets unvaccinated people. I've already looked at job listings all over the country for my profession, I'm cleaning out my apartment over the next couple of months so I can move easily. There's no telling what's coming but it's not going to be good. There is going to be a massive push in the fall. I know the climate agenda is coming too, they are going to discourage people from driving their cars and traveling. It's going to be more suffocating control. I have a sick feeling that something very big is about to happen and it's going to make the whole coronavirus vaccine thing looks small. I hope I'm wrong but it's a very bad feeling I have.</p>
<p>My job went from being in an office 5 days a week 2 my management saying we would be coming back for one day a week in the fall and now they're saying they only want us in twice a year. I work in healthcare and I don't have any direct patient contact anymore thank God. I'm hoping I will be safe because of the nature of my remote work. Still I worry like you. I am not taking this. I don't give a shit I'm just not doing it. And I'm not a superstitious anti vaxxer so fuck anyone who tries to shame me. I am an educated person who is paying attention to what I am seeing. All I can say is start planning. If you are really serious about not taking this vaccine it may require major changes in your life. I am coming around to the fact that I may have to leave my state and quit my job. I'm older and this is not something I ever thought I'd be doing but I am absolutely not taking that injection. Stay strong my friend! There are millions like you even though they want us to think we are horrible people and we're holding the entire universe back. Don't buy into that, know that you're not alone and there are many of us who feel this way. I also think there will be many people who are doing this who will have regrets.</p>

        <p>I'm going to be frank here: in large parts of the world we can't. You need to decide how far you are willing to go to avoid the vaccine. Does it mean moving to somewhere without any mandates? Does it mean ending relationships, changing careers, being homeless? I hate that I have to think about this, but this is reality for many of us.</p>

        <p>So many people having horrible side effects and dying, yet they still push this crap for a new version of the flu or a cold.  I might take this more seriously if it was Ebola or something that actually has a more than .005% kill rate.  I just can't wrap my head around the fear that all the sheep have over this.</p>

        <p>Load clips and stock up on apocalypse gear. Get ready for the blue helmets, they've been authorized for almost a year to assist in "vaccination" efforts, and unlike our own militaries, they're not citizens and don't have any care for or ties to you.</p>

        <p>I hope we can hold out long enough until, either they see massive repercussions from the jabs and they are unable to be hide the dangers any further, (this is obviously a tainted victory as loved ones may be harmed) or that they cannot keep the fear level up anymore and we just move on. Wishful thinking though.</p>

        <p>I worry as well but I’m going to stay honest. I’m willing to lose everything I’ve ever worked for - I finally have everything I’ve ever dreamed of. It will most definitely be hard but I know in my heart that if I waver on my truths I will be deeply dissatisfied with myself. And, if we don’t hold our ground, I am almost certain we will lose everything anyway. Please stay true to yourself. You could unknowingly cause a domino effect. Maybe a co-worker or friend that didn’t want the shot finds out they are the only one left (because you’ve lied). Now, they are backed in a corner and get the shot. Maybe their mom or sister thought wow, now I’m the only one and they decide they have to and so on. Stay strong together. EVERY LIFE MATTERS. YOUR LIFE MATTERS AND OUR FREEDOM IS EVERYTHING.</p>
