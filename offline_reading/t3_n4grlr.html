    <strong>Gaslit at the Drs office today</strong>
    <p><p>So I had a doctor appointment today with my rheumatologist. I’ve only been to her once and I really liked her and it was about a year ago when I had a bunch of random blood work done and my RA factor showed up to be at 46 when a normal level is between zero and 14. Because of this my general doctor referred me to her to make sure that there wasn’t something going on with me.I have never been diagnosed with any auto immune diseases or rheumatoid arthritis itself, but I do have a tendency to have a lot of inflammation in my body in my joints. I even had to have bursectomy‘s due to excruciatingly painful bursitis. I have been perfectly fine since those surgeries. In the past I have had some bizarre things happening to my body as far as pain and inflammation and vascular stuff but I’ve never been diagnosed with anything specific and I’ve been to specialists in the past. Generally speaking though I am a healthy person. I’m not on any medication’s and I don’t have any chronic conditions except for that joint pain.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was having a lot of pain lately and I wanted her advice on recommendations for reducing my pain. I work in healthcare myself so I already know a lot about my own condition and I’ve tried a lot of things on my own but I’m always up for hearing what a professional in the field has to tell me.</p>
<p>I had my appointment and at the end I figured I would bring up the vaccine as I do not want this for myself and I’m concerned that at a certain point my work may try to require it. I already knew what I was going to say, my rationale for not wanting it and backing up my decision. I was basically trying to get some support in case I need it at some point.</p>
<p>I started speaking and I said to her that I just wanted to mention that I’ve chosen not to take the vaccine for myself due to the fact that I have had reactions to things in the past and the unpredictability of how my body reacts to foreign things is a factor for me. I said that I’m not saying I will never take it but for now I’m choosing not to. Then I said I would at the very least rather wait until it’s actually approved by the FDA and the clinical trials are over. Truthfully I plan on never getting this but I did not want to sound like an insane anti-VAXr because I’m not. I even mentioned that I’m not against vaccines at all, I’ve had many of them throughout my career and in the past it’s just this one that I don’t want.</p>
<p>Well at that point that’s when everything shit the bed. She looked at me like I had nine heads and said I am highly recommending this for all my patients, everyone needs to get this vaccine. She said wouldn’t you rather have a week of joint pain and various side effects than 4 to 6 weeks of Covid? (No I wouldn’t) Where are you hearing that this is not FDA approved? That’s not true. And the clinical trials have been done that’s not true either. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I know for a fact 100% that these vaccines have not been approved by the FDA. So I said to her are you speaking of the fact that they’ve been approved for emergency use? Because they haven’t been fully approved by the FDA except for emergency use. And as far as the clinical trials, there were a few thousand people involved and that was it And there is no long-term data.The trials are going on until 2023 and the people that are getting the vaccine now are part of that trial. She completely denied everything I was saying. The crazy thing is at that moment I honestly started wondering? Did I imagine this whole thing? Is this woman’s seriously telling me this? I am in a major medical center in New York City, how does this person not know these things? Is she gaslighting me? Or does she really not know these things? </p>
<p>I walked out of that office with tears coming down my face all the way home from frustration. I felt so crazy that I actually googled are the vaccines approved by the FDA, and the first thing that came up was no they are not. I actually felt compelled to check for information that I already knew. This is the second doctor that I’ve gone to who will not listen to me and before this I really liked both of them and they were really good listeners and have helped me a lot with various things so I know they are not quacks. I have legitimate reasons why I don’t want this for myself.</p>
<p>Fast forward my boss calls me, she has been a nurse for 35 years and she’s an amazing person. She’s Director of my department and she is so knowledgeable. She has a lot of common sense and I felt comfortable talking with her. I told her what happened and she was shocked. I said to her I need to run a few facts by you because I’m starting to wonder if I’m going crazy here. The vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting Covid right? The vaccine doesn’t stop you from transmitting it right? The vaccine only lessons your symptoms if you do get it right? The vaccines are not fully approved by the FDA as of yet? The clinical trials are still going on right now until 2023 right? Thankfully my boss said absolutely yes! Everything you’re saying is 100% accurate and she was absolutely wrong. You should absolutely send her an email with links to sources that back up what you’re saying because she’s misinforming her patients. Thankfully she told me to not let this doctor make me doubt what I know is true because everything I’m saying is accurate. She said doctors are being told to push this hard, either she was doing that or she genuinely was clueless and either way that’s pretty scary.</p>
<p>She also told me that she regretted getting the vaccine, she had a moment of temporary insanity, those are her words, and as she sat there and they put the needle into her arm she thought to herself what the hell am I doing? This is crazy I don’t need this. She said she’s never going back again, she won’t take any more injections.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted to get this out here, I’m so disappointed and I felt so crushed. As a healthcare professional I was always taught that you’re supposed to educate patients and give them facts and let them make the decision as to what they want to do regarding their health. You tell them pros and cons of something and you don’t tell them what to do. These doctors are basically telling people what to do they’re not allowing you to decide for yourself. If everyone is so confident about these vaccines why don’t they feel protected if they’ve had them? Why do they feel like virtually everyone in the entire galaxy has to get this vaccine for them to feel safe? We’ve been told that the vaccines don’t prevent transmission and don’t prevent you from getting it they only make your symptoms less severe. If you’ve gotten yours why are you trying to force me to get one as well? At this point my boss told me has a based doctor near where she lives who is completely rational and normal and is telling people pros and cons and letting them decide for themselves. If it comes down to needing some sort of support she’s going to hook me up with her doctor. </p>
<p>I just can’t believe what things have turned into. I am absolutely never going to be able to go back to life as it used to be before this, my trust in virtually everything has been shatterered. Every time I’m dealing with someone I have this weird feeling that I’m in a modern day version of invasion of the body snatchers. People who were previously sane and normal have all turned into lunatics with this stuff. They don’t question any of it and they look at you like you are crazy when you have a legitimate questions and reservations. How can they not see that it’s concerning to a lot of people to take an injection with no long-term data and reports of many side effects? A vaccine that isn’t even fully approved and is still in the clinical trial period?This is all just so exhausting.</p></p>

        <p>Yes! And the insane thing is I went to her previously and she was excellent! There was nothing weird about her at all but this was the January before this whole thing started. I had a great experience with her. This was shocking.</p>

        <p>My boss actually mentioned that, she knows a lot of people that work within the healthcare systems here in the city and she said a lot of doctors are facing a lot of pressure to get patients to get this vaccine, they’ve been called in and told that they really need to push this so it’s definitely going on. I really worry about giving this to children and pregnant women and even this doctor today said well there are no studies dealing with children and pregnant women and people with autoimmune disease. And I’m standing there thinking but you deal with people with autoimmune disease and you’re telling people to get this? I just didn’t know what to say. For the first time ever I was actually glad to have a mask on my face so she couldn’t see my mouth hanging wide open in shock LOL</p>

        <p>This has made me so hesitant about it. I’ve been going to the same doctor for two decades and he is excellent, everyone I’ve referred to him is so happy that they found him. He has saved my life several times. His stance on the vaccine is really surprising.</p>

        <p>As a physician - can confirm there was a lot of pressure to COVID vax. The profession has taken a real hit with 19 as I’ve seen colleagues buying into the hysteria.  The COVID response is the most unscientific and most widespread fail of public health in the history of humanity.</p>

        <p>So glad you posted here! Are they actually offering you guys incentives? How are they pressuring you? My boss said she’s positive it’s going on because she knows people that work for several facilities and they told her this. I’m wondering what exactly they are subjecting physicians to? I am a rehab therapist, I’ve worked in healthcare for 21 years. My boss has been a nurse for over 30. I work with MDs, nurse practitioners, social workers, fellow rehab therapists, pharmacists etc. A lot of different disciplines. They are all telling me that there’s a lot of pressure out there. Many of these people have been in healthcare for decades. They are saying that a lot of people have lost their minds over this.</p>

        <p>At my main hospital, the COVID czar guy (chief medical officer) sends out almost daily “briefings” where he reports vax uptake by hospital personnel. He reported that “virtually all” physicians had received  the vax. I have been vocally opposed to general COVID protocols including masks and lockdowns. Most hospital people know my position. I have the luxury of being their most prolific surgeon so they really can’t marginalize me.</p>
<p>It’s sad to watch otherwise capable and intelligent healthcare providers grabbing for a cup of the Flavor-aide</p>

        <p>That is crazy, I am subjected to the same thing. I can’t even tell you how many notices per day I’m getting about taking the vaccine. It’s constant harassment over it. I’ve been grilled multiple times by various people asking me when I’m going to schedule it and why I haven’t gotten it. It’s becoming obnoxious at this point. Glad to hear that you have job security 👍🏻</p>

        <p>I’m in a less intense state but the camps are
Definitely present.. The CEO is more reasonable than the chief medical officer and is relatively new. The CMO is a relic. The letter is intended to hold the CMO accountable to actual science and not the “pop science” he’s been mired in</p>

        <p>Never in the history of mankind have we put this kind of pressure and stress on other humans to get a vaccine that hasn't even finished clinical trials or gotten approval. I've never been pressured into taking the flu shot and I work in healthcare. I have all my important immunizations MMR, DTaP, Polio... etc but why should I a healthy 30 something be pressured into a shot for a virus that most likely I'll never contract. (I rarely even get a cold)</p>

        <p>So I was back up in my hometown (Philly) a couple weeks ago and having breakfast with my friend. She's like well I still wear my mask because of asymptomatic. I said do you really believe that? She said yes. I even sent her an article later on and never got a response. They don't actually want to listen to science. Probably will be dumping her as a friend because I don't do stupid.</p>

        <p>Very true. The weird thing is I went to someone else before her and I really did not like this person and she was highly recommended to me by people who I really respect in the field. And she was really great for that first appointment I had with her a year ago. This totally changed my opinion of her.</p>

        <p>I feel like there is a general trend where medicine is getting more impersonal and bureaucratic. The thing with a lot of doctors and medicine is basically trusting others to be right when you don’t know. So having a doctor who is ignorant on this isn’t surprising. They don’t research beyond what they are told because they don’t have to. Your rheumatologist probably doesn’t know shit about psychiatry, and a psychiatrist probably doesn’t know shit about rheumatology. That’s ok because they know their field and what applies to it. </p>
<p>Personal story here. Right now I’m off on workers comp. I broke my ring finger and had to see the doctor. Well I live in a small city and the local hand specialist at the hospital said it needed surgery. He said without it, there’s a likelihood I won’t regain function. He said even with surgery though that I probably wouldn’t regain full range of motion. Well I put if off for a second opinion at a place that is one of the best in my state, if not the country. I’m still waiting to see them, but my finger has already regained full function and range of motion. It’s still a little sore, but its just fine. I don’t know if its because I constantly pull on my finger to pop it, and maybe I reset the joint avulsion... but I’m questioning why the surgery in the first place if it was that simple for me to do. Obviously its because they want that workers comp money.</p>

        <p>You were smart to wait. Totally agree with what you’re saying. I have experience in my profession working on a burn unit in a trauma center, I’ve also worked with TBI patients, strokes, chronic diseases etc. I’ve never worked in pediatrics. It’s totally normal that you choose areas that you specialize in and you know absolutely nothing about areas that you don’t treat patients in or have much training in. I have had people ask me questions about pediatric cases and I always say I have little to no training in pediatrics I’ve only worked with adults and I’ve only worked in these specific areas. A lot of times they look confused like what are you stupid? You don’t know everything? there are plenty of people that work in pediatrics that would be completely Lost if they stepped foot inside a hand clinic. That’s just how it is. We can’t know everything it’s impossible.</p>

        <p>That’s where people need to admit that there are gaps in knowledge. I see way too many people today focusing more on what they know than what they don’t know. I’m not afraid to admit that I’m wrong about something or that I don’t know everything. There is a seemingly infinite and complex world that we are just beginning to see. That’s why I don’t understand how some are afraid to question this new vaccine. Has the wool really been pulled over this many peoples eyes? I will say that here in Ohio, a lot of doctors and nurses aren’t wanting to get vaccinated. Nor do those who are home health aids or work with the elderly in assisted living facilities. I know several myself. You’ll be hard pressed though to find most going against the CDC. They assume they are the end all be all when it comes to this. They are blindly trusting because it is what they do with so many other things.</p>

        <p>I have said this several times recently, please give me legitimate information so I can educate myself and I am more than happy to change my mind about things! I’m in a constant state of learning, life is much more interesting that way. And things change, you might know certain procedures of way of dealing with things and then something new comes along. Flexibility is key. At my place of work 60% of our home health Aids are refusing, it might even be a little bit higher than that. Overall at least 50% of our staff are refusing to take the vaccine as well. It’s like this in many places. I have often wondered the same thing you’re mentioning here, is it really that hard to grasp that people have reservations about this? You’re injecting something into your body, the disease has an extremely high survival rate. There are so many things involved here that people are ignoring. And on top of all of this the media is starting to blame people that do not want to take this vaccine for everything going wrong in the world right now. They are  being Grossly irresponsible and inflammatory and making things even worse.</p>

        <p>Have you ever tried it for any medical condition? If not then you can’t comment! 
I have used Tcm (for a year) before I left my home country for a few issues that could not be diagnosed by western shit medicine. It’s amazing!! When I find a certified Tcm practitioner in my new country I will def start my treatments again as my issues are flaring after not having treatment for 4 months. I have always had kidney issues didn’t realize until I was using Chinese herbs how much water was not getting released from my body. It gets a bad rap but it’s hundreds to thousands of years old medicine science! tCM doctors were actually the first doctors to Crete vaccines for rabies - they used the brain of the rabid dog and then had the person infected eat the brain. It’s really very interesting 🤔</p>

        <p>A while back I was conversing with a family member who's becoming a nurse. I was questioning the medical field (before covid) and they told me that they take an oath when becoming a nurse to question everything for the sake of their patients, to never straight up believe what they're told without doing their own research or SOMETHING, idk. But they basically told me there's nurses who still care, and they would never do anything that might harm anyone. </p>
<p>Well they got the vaccine. LOL. And I'm like what happened to questioning everything? </p>
<p>Anyways, it makes me sad. The end.</p>

She actually said I don’t know what on earth I was thinking I must’ve temporarily lost my mind there and I’m never doing that again! But she actually told me not to let this make me feel pressured, that I don’t have to take it and no ones forcing it. I told her I’m really worried that work will start requiring it and she said there’s absolutely no mention of this at all and she said I know I won’t be taking it so we’re going to have to figure out what to do about this.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing your experience. Ive thus far managed to avoid going to a doctor for more than a year but now they’re holding my birth control hostage unless I come in. I just know a part of that appt will be pressure to get the vaccine and it’s good to prepare myself for this level of misinformation being given to me by a doctor in a medical setting.</p>

<p>Just flat out refuse. Tell them that you will not be participating in a medical trial involving an unapproved treatment. If they try to say it's approved, point them at this: https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download</p>
<p>If they persist, tell them that as it is an unapproved treatment, it's still in the experimental phase, and coercing you into taking it violates</p>

        <p>I was absolutely shocked. This person either is horribly misinformed herself and giving incorrect information to her patients or she’s doing this deliberately to pressure people into getting this vaccine. That’s not advocating for your patients. That’s not allowing them to give informed consent. Are we not allowed to know the truth here? Do they think if we know the truth we might choose not to do this? I really can’t figure out if she did this on purpose or if she honestly doesn’t know this herself. If I had known I was going in that this was coming I would’ve had some available documents or links ready to show her on my phone. I’ve actually gotten emails through my own work which is a large healthcare provider here and many of these facts have been provided to me through my own job! It’s not like I read these things out of USA Today or or yahoo news or something LOL</p>

        <p>I can relate to this story. Ignorance comes to mind. It is possible that they realize how horrible the decision is they have made. In some strange way they have convinced themselves of something else. Almost like a coping mechanism. It is going to be very interesting to see how this all plays out.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry for your experience. I feel like this is exactly what “anti-vaxxer” parents go through after their kid has been injured. They start mentioning the new symptoms and asking uncomfortable questions then bam-they’re automatically labeled and dismissed. Now you don’t have to listen to them and can dismiss any of their concerns as crazy anti science rants.</p>

        <p>Oh Love. I'm terribly sorry you're dealing with this.</p>
<p>Word from a woman who spent 20 years in the Healthcare circle of death, believe me when I tell you nothing theyre going to give you for RA works. Nothing. Its one of those diseases that has no cure but worse, no cause. I was on everything. 14 different ones. Tests, scans, all of it.</p>
<p>Cannabis is the only medication that works. My quality of life is 75% back to normal.  It stops the pain, it controls my weight, and it keeps me calm during this rough time. Try it as a first treatment. Don't do what I did and try it as a last resort. I can't get 10 years back.</p>
<p>I haven't trusted Big Pharma in 15 years. Why on earth would these psychos think I'm going to trust them now?</p>

        <p>Medical Cannabis. Tried CBD first and it doesn't work without THC. I started using RSO last summer [Rick Simpson Oil] and built my tolerance to where I'm not fuzzy anymore. </p>
<p>It's a great plant. I prefer smoking it and using RSO. The full plant is the best. I also have a little oil pen for breakthru pain that works in about 10 minutes after inhaling. Then I bring my BP down and carry on with the day.</p>

        <p>Totally agree with you but I am living in a place where this is the resounding public opinion and I am aware of the fact that in order to have a normal discussion with a person who thinks like this I don't want to raise their alarm Bells within the first sentence of the conversation. I am sure it was documented in my medical record that I am anti-vaccine at this point so it really doesn't matter. Doesn't matter that I've had many in my life and I don't think every single vaccine is garbage. It only matters that I don't want this particular one at this point. I'm tired at this point, I got very little sleep last night this has really chipped away at me and I'm just not going to think about it today. I know what I'm going to do and nothing anyone tries to force on me is going to change my mind. Also, I am at the end of my rope and Peak tolerance level for being told I'm killing people.</p>

        <p>We just have to stop giving into the most dangerous aspect of all of this. It's an attack on free thought, not even just free speech. They are trying to make it so you can't think the vaccine is a bad without being labeled as insane. You aren't insane for using your brain is all I'm trying to tell you. And when we believe that we are, we've been successfully gaslit and conquered.</p>

        <p>I totally get what you're saying, and I have said very similar things to others as to what you're saying to me so I do appreciate it. Like with the mask, I will tell people repeatedly especially when we are outside please take the mask off. You're reinforcing this if you walk around with a mask on. We are outside we don't have to do this why are you wearing your mask your reinforcing all of this. So I get what you're saying! It makes total sense! Living through this in a place like New York has been the hardest thing I've experienced in my life. 99% of the time I feel like I am the only person who feels this way. It is honestly crushing at times. Every time I do try to engage someone in conversation or go into a store or walk around without a mask it feels like I am taking major risks, which is pathetic! A lot of times I absolutely do not feel safe here. People are seriously mentally unstable and they will physically attack you if they feel like you are being irresponsible.</p>

        <p>Sorry for being rude or anything. I guess I'm passionate about our futures not being dystopian. I just don't want that for my kids. I know I could survive it (or die happily fighting it) but I'm not sure about my wife and kids. </p>
<p>The last thing I want to be is another one opposed to you when it's the entire world telling us we shouldn't hold on to our autonomy.</p>

        <p>No apology needed! I get your passion about this I have the same feelings! I am constantly taking risks here in New York, starting discussions with people, not wearing a mask Etc. I can't even tell you how stressful it is especially being a woman alone here. I feel very vulnerable and nervous about being attacked. I wish I was kidding but I'm not. People have actually been assaulted for going against the narrative here. Part of me is always expecting someone to punch me or attack me or do god-knows-what. I feel like I'm constantly tiptoeing and walking on eggshells around mentally unstable people all the time. It's really sad that I have to hold back when speaking to a doctor like I did! But I knew that if I didn't specify certain things she would shut me down and it didn't even help because she shut me down anyway!</p>

        <p>Most likely what would happen, I don't blame you. Sounds like you're doin more to stand for truth than I am, so I shouldn't judge anything really.</p>
<p>Well, I'll pray for your protection out there. If you need to message someone for some kind of support you can. Stay as safe as you can.</p>

        <p>The only pediatrician that would see my son to get his school shots was an RA specialist for kids. She's pro vax and pro choice. All the other pediatricians I called said they don't see unvaxxed kids--even to start vaccines🤡 </p>
<p>I wonder how a DO would treat you. I used to see a DO who was into herbal remedies. Thankfully my current physician didn't talk to me about covid or vaccines at all. She asked. I said No. That was the end of it.</p>

        <p>Recommending a vaccine that causes reactions that are autoimmune in nature (Bells palsy, skin infections, ya know, death) when you yourself have rhumethoid arthritis is not okay. No medical professional should ever push treatments on patients</p>
