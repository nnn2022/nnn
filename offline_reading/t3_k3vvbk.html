        <p>I wrote to them, and this is the reply they've sent me back, if anyone is curious.</p>
<p>&rt; Thank you for contacting me about our return to a tiered system of restrictions.</p>
<p>&rt; I spoke at length to the Chief Executive of the [redacted] and [redacted] hospital last week who tells me that he is more worried about the situation at the moment than he was during the first wave. The number of people in hospital in [redacted] with COVID-19 is higher than at any point since July and the hospital is much fuller with other patients, as is normal in winter. Parts of the hospital cannot be used for periods when patients become infected and many patients need side rooms and isolation which is difficult for the hospital to be able to provide. We cannot have a situation where we run out of hospital beds. We owe it to everyone we love to help the NHS make sure they have the capacity to look after all of us. The NHS has just been given an extra £3 billion by the Chancellor to make sure that everyone who is ill for whatever reason gets treated as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&rt; I believe that it is vital that we act on the latest data available to ensure that the most appropriate actions are taken at the most appropriate time. I know my colleagues throughout the Government agree with this principle, and are working with researchers, scientific advisers, and data teams to ensure that they have access to information as quickly as possible. I also welcome that the Government is continuing to make data publicly available.</p>
<p>&rt; I fully recognise concerns expressed by constituents that national restrictions were put in place in response to modelling which did not factor in regional measures established through the tiered system. However, while I understand that there was a mistake in plotting the confidence intervals, which was corrected as soon as it was identified, there was no error in the underlying analysis or advice to government. On that basis, the medium-term projections on daily deaths and hospital admissions for the next six weeks remain the same, and have not been altered: this means that, with no further action taken, we would be likely to breach the first wave of hospital admissions and deaths in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>&rt; I understand that lockdowns and other restrictions have caused enormous stress and disruption to people’s lives. I also understand that lockdowns do cause other side effects and we must be mindful of these when considering policy options. I know that Ministers agree and are working hard to consider all possibilities before putting forward comprehensive measures where necessary.</p>
<p>&rt; I welcome that new rapid turnaround tests, which can help to identify and isolate people who do not have symptoms but are unintentionally spreading the virus, can also be used to identify people who do not have the virus. This means that, in due course, it should be possible to offer people who test negative the prospect of greater freedoms. </p>
<p>&rt; I would like to reassure you that all the measures put in place to respond to this outbreak, are proportionate to the threat we face. It is important that they will only be used when strictly necessary, and will only be in place for as long as required to respond to the situation. I welcome measures in place to review this act on a six monthly basis to ensure that the measures remain appropriate. It is clear that the virus will be with us for some time, and it is vital that we are able to take necessary steps to save lives.</p>
<p>&rt; Thank you again for taking the time to contact me.</p>
<p>These people deserve to be voted out of government next election.</p>

        <p>I don't believe for one moment any of the MPs is serious about challenging the government. There is no such thing called government and opposition. They all take their orders from the same master.</p>
<p>You can petition your MP all you want, and the result will be FA.</p>
<p>Worse, your MP may pass on your details to the local KGB.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I think that's just paranoid. If there is a grand conspiracy then they directly control few people and indirectly control the vast majority of people including you and me. I think there are many good / neutral politicians and corporate leaders who either simply don't suspect a grand conspiracy or who keep silent about their suspicions.</p>
