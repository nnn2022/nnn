    <strong>I'm gonna be honest... I have no idea how I'm going to make it till this time next year.</strong>
    <p><p>Full disclosure this is not a suicidal cry for help. I'm not going to kill myself.... BUT I simply don't see how I get to next year with my sanity intact. Both my wife and I are struggling in a pretty profound way that we never expected. </p>
<p>The social isolation... neighbors pitted against neighbors... the sanctimony from the left over masks and rule following the likes of which I've never seen before in my life time and the complete alienation from family. </p>
<p>All of my family has fallen so hard into doomer territory that discussions are basically of the table now because there is no talking them down from the idea that this is a super plague that is going to wipe out society. My parents have already had covid and despite being immune now they are holed up in their house like frightened hermits and refuse to see or speak to anyone. </p>
<p>I haven't seen a coworker face to face in 5 months and I'm going through at least 2 cases of beer a week now. </p>
<p>I've gained so much weight since January that none of my clothes fit anymore. At least twice a week my wife cries herself to sleep because she is travel restricted from seeing her family overseas and with the way things are going we have no end in sight. </p>
<p>And now with all the vaccine talk we are honestly scared on multiple fronts. Final approval of the vaccines isn't likely until Q1 of 2021 and then you're looking at months to ramp up production to the point where you can begin inoculating people which takes us into 2022 before enough people have had their shots that governments ease off restrictions. </p>
<p>And we're talking about a vaccine developed in months instead of the usual 10 years. I have serious safety concerns over that and am terrified to let my kids get it but I will likely be barred from traveling for work without it and there is no way we will be allowed to enter the EU to see family without the shots. </p>
<p>I just... can't. How the hell are we supposed to keep living like this? </p>
<p>I'm losing my mind.</p></p>

        <p>One thing I would suggest and I have been there with regards to trying to drink a problem away is to slow down on the alcohol intake if you possibly can. It's fine at night when it is helping to eliminate the problem from your mind but, eventually it throws you into deeper and deeper despair each following day. Try going one day without it, then have one. Then go two days without one and have another and then 3 and have one and so on. This helped me to quit completely as the longer the gap between sessions the less the desire to drink your problems away.  </p>
<p>Try to switch off all media that is reminding you of the doom and gloom out there and subscribe to more positive spaces around the web that will cheer you up and help you see the lighter side of life. Distract yourself with some good books (audible or conventional) to transport you to somewhere else. Find some really immersive games to sink your free time into to help prevent you thinking too much about how bad everything is. Maybe even find some odd jobs around the house that you could do to keep you busy and distracted.  </p>
<p>Get yourself out into the greenspace as much as you possibly can. This is the single most important thing you could probably do right now. Absorb natures sights and sounds and just go for long walks to clear your mind of the daily clutter of thoughts that are currently bringing you down. I know it can be difficult to cross the threshold of your front door when you are in this state of mind but, crossing it is going to be the hardest part. Once you are out there it's surprising how quickly the weight is lifted from your mind.  </p>
<p>Take comfort in the fact that things will return to the way they were. There is an end in sight to all this madness. If you feel the creeping thought process of doom upon you, try to immediately and consciously change your thoughts to something more light and upbeat. Keep doing this as a  form of cognitive rewiring (It's a battle but it can be done).  </p>
<p>I totally understand how you are feeling and I sincerely hope that any of that helps you to make some small changes in order to feel at least a little bit better. Take care and all the best of health to you and yours. Keep on keeping on and things will get better.</p>

        <p>try using melatonin when you are ready to quit. It will help you sleep and is natural. I am not a doctor and this is only to help your for the first few weeks. It helped for me, take 1 and hour before bed and you will sleep much better.</p>

        <p>I hit the drink hard after almost losing my son to meningitis when he was around 3 years old. There was a point when he was going into the theatre to be operated on and I had to help the anaesthetist by putting the mask over my sons face to get him to sleep for the op. The look my son gave me as this was taking place was one where not only was he totally panicked but he looked at me as if I was about to do him mortal harm.  </p>
<p>Despite dealing with everything reasonably well up to that point (even with it being a touch and go situation)  I completely broke down outside the operating theatre. This moment in my life utterly broke me. Thankfully, we got him through the worst of it but he contracted MRSA whilst in there which required more treatment and he remained in hospital for 6 weeks. During that period I could not get the image out of my mind. Every night I would replay the moment in my head and I would be completely overwhelmed and consumed by it. I didn't really know what PTSD was at the time but, I came to realise later that, that was what was going on. I began the process of rewiring my thought process as suggested above and eventually that worked for me.  </p>
<p>I drank heavily for around 3 or 4 years as a result of all of that (only at night when everyone had gone to bed) to try and get rid of that video sequence in my mind. Although it helped at night when blotting it out, it made me have a much more depressive day to day outlook. I tried to stop through complete abstinence but, the allure of drinking to blot things out kept coming back and I kept falling off the wagon.  </p>
<p>The method outlined for the OP was the only thing that worked for me. It took time but, eventually I got to a point where the lure of the alcohol lost it's pull and the periods of abstinence got progressively longer. After a while I realised I didn't even need to drink on the days when I had reached 7, 8, 9 and 10 days in between so I wouldn't. I now no longer touch the stuff unless it's a family wake or something. It was difficult in the beginning but it is possible. Slow and steady wins the race on that one.  </p>
<p>All the advice I initially gave to the OP was pretty much my coping mechanisms for getting back to the real me and I hope that it helps you or anyone else dealing with issues around alcohol and depression. Things can and do change and they also do get better. Best wishes for your journey to sobriety and a happier you. Take care.</p>

        <p>Baclofen is said to help a lot in quitting. Not sure if it helps for the psychological aspect of alcoholism though. </p>
<p>You could also try to take something that makes you feel better than alcohol for a short while until you get your shit together, like opiates. They are demonized but if you treat them as a short term holiday until you solve the underlying psychological problems, it shouldn't cause a problem.</p>

        <p>I think you have taken the essence of what I was saying out of context and applied a flawed logic to it. What I meant is it's fine when it is eliminating the problematic thoughts (which it does) but that reality comes back to bite you the next day and throws you into a deeper level of despair. I think something may have been lost to you in translation and interpretation.</p>

        <p>In my state, the health secretary basically said that we might have to wear masks and social distance until the end of 2021, plus business restrictions will remain in place. I don’t see how I’ll get through another year like this either. I haven’t seen any of my coworkers or been to my office in eight months. </p>
<p>I’m not taking the vaccine. I simply see no point in doing so unless my job mandates it, and I feel that would be an overreaction anyway because I work in an office with no contact with the public. And it’s not a healthcare business either. I also will never get a COVID test unless I get symptoms. I’m not going to drive the paranoia of getting tested just because. That’s the best I can do to not give into the fear.</p>

        <p>there's plenty of people are you who pretend to care about covid but will gladly hang out with you. I see it all the damn time. They wear the little mask and pretend to socially isolated but will gladly have you in their home. </p>
<p>people have become so friendless over the years that I'm sure people 40 and under are struggling to have even one friend they see regularly. </p>
<p>sorry if I'm rambling what I'm getting at is you dont have to be socially isolated. My social life has improved with covid since people are so lonely they actually reach out now lol</p>

        <p>I'm trying to convince my wife to move somewhere rural.  We live in a city because she's a city person and likes being close to all thing things cities offer.  I told her: "Well, all of those things are gone now. But our kids like wide open spaces.  So why don't we buy several acres somewhere and just move?"</p>

        <p>This is us. My husband and I moved to a big city from a smaller city last year. We love city living. </p>
<p>After this is all said and done(If it ever will be)cities will never be the same. They are done. They will be empty shells of their former selves. So what’s the point of staying? We decided there wasn’t one.</p>
<p>We’ve changed focus on what we want and decided owning a house in a smaller town will suit us fine. Up until now we’ve been renting(this a long story I won’t bore you with). We want a dog. We like to walk, we enjoy going to coffee shops in the evening. All three of those things can be met by owning a house in a small town. </p>
<p>We found a town, and we found a house. Now it’s just a waiting game.</p>

        <p>I like the idea of small town living as well.  It seems like a great compromise.  Buy 5 or so acres just outside town and you've got the best of both worlds.  My wife actually likes authentic small towns, she just can't stand "suburbia." And I get it.  4-lane intersections surrounded by the same big box stores, vinyl-sided McMansions on postage-stamp size lots.  It's gross.</p>

        <p>We personally don’t want 5 acres outside of the city. We want to be able to walk into a town centre, have coffee. Go to a pub. But also access to good nature walks.</p>
<p>Up until this year the thought of living in the suburbs gave me anxiety. Literal anxiety. The thought of owning a home in the suburbs was abhorrent to me. I get your wife’s point of view. </p>
<p>I don’t know where you’re located, but we’re in the U.K.  We spent a couple months driving around to town centres in close proximity to my husbands work deciding which one was the right fit for us. We found one we were happy with. Even though we are in the ‘suburbs’ it’s a small enough town that everything is close enough to walk to. No big box stores, very Tudor city centre. Picturesque. River walks, local butchers, and a costa for our coffee.</p>

        <p>Ah.  Well, good luck on the house!  If I could ever convince my wife to move, it would be to a place like you described.  I'm in the US and had a very "Murica" upbringing as a kid.  Lots of land, horses, goats, dirt bikes, guns. etc.  High trust society.  We never locked the doors at night.  Amusingly, my parents moved there back in the late 60s in response to how crazy the cities were becoming.  I grew up, moved to the city, got married, had a family, and now I want nothing more than to return.  It's probably just a desire to return to my childhood and escape the current craziness.</p>

        <p>That’s fair. My husband and I are from Canada. We moved to the U.K. 7 years ago.</p>
<p>I grew up in Toronto, but spent my summers in rural Quebec on a farm, and the weekends at the cottage in the Muskokas. Best of both worlds.</p>
<p>My husband grew up in your kind of town, but dreamt of bigger things. He was never a farm boy.</p>
<p>Our intention was to buy a property in Italy for our retirement, but brexit happened, then this. </p>
<p>Buying a house here isn’t our first choice, but ya gotta roll with the times.</p>

<li>
<p>Turn off the media and stop reading anything to do with COVID for a week or longer. It will help A LOT to put it out of your mind as much as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go outside and do things. Walk, run, play with pets, build something, whatever. Even better, try to go to a place without masks, even if that’s a beach or middle of the forest. The point is to get away from it all and stop thinking about it. (I hope you’re not living under harsh travel restrictions.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find things to do. Cook, craft, write, read, learn a language. Think about goals you’ve always wanted to accomplish that can be worked on right now, despite the circumstances. Focus on these things. These are things you can control. You can’t control what the rest of the world does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defy the government as much as possible. Perhaps that means ordering a mesh mask off of Etsy so it only looks like you’re complying and only wearing the mask at all when forced. Going as many places as possible and doing as many things as you can get away with. Talking to people a lot. At least around here, I’ve found a ton of people who privately don’t agree with what’s going on and I usually remove my mask when talking to them. About half will eventually take their mask off too as the conversation continues because they don’t like wearing it when I’m not bothering to. These conversations occur in parking lots etc where the gestapo isn’t present since we’re outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to protests if you can. Try to find like-minded people to talk to in real life. They’ll be willing to take the masks off and have a normal conversation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s not your fault any of this is happening and you don’t have much control over it. So stop wasting energy fretting over things you can’t control. Stop consuming media. Give your brain a massive break from thinking about it all the time. Ruminating on it day-after-day will not change anything. Live your life as normally as you can get away with, set goals and achieve them as much as you can, defy Big Brother as much as you can. Don’t let your mind be consumed with thoughts of lockdown related bullshit 24/7. Find other things to think about. Don’t stay holed up inside. Go outside as much as possible and find others to interact with.</p>

        <p>I'm right there with you. Instead of alcohol I get high just to shut my brain down otherwise it's wondering how I'm gonna continue this charade. I gained 13lbs since March. I've never gained that much weight in one year in my life. I've never had depression or losing the will to live until this year. My hubs is trying to find creative ways to entertain us because he knows I'm walking towards that edge. If you need someone to vent to feel free to PM me. We need good neighbors to help us through these dark times. ❤️</p>

I'm also separated from family overseas and I'm terrified of the vaccine because I've had a horrible reaction to a vaccine and I know the drug companies have zero liability for damages from vaccine products and the COVID vaccine is a new kind never used in humans before.

<p>WAAT? They have no liability for the damage they'll  cause? So if the conspiracies about the sterilization are true ,then that means ,that they'll just say: whhoopsseeey daaysseey ,we totally didn't see that coming, tough luck.

        <p>Yes. Vaccine manufactureres were granted freedom from liability after basically blackmailing congress in 1986 claiming they would stop all vaccine distribution if the government didn't comply. This was corporate backlash after a torrent of lawsuits caused by a flu vaccine batch that caused autoimmune disease and other severe injuries in the 70s.</p>
<p>If you are lucky enough to even be considered, the only compensation for vaccine damages is through a tax funded kangaroo "vaccine court" which is 100% no fault, 100% of the time. So even when the vaccine is acknowledged to have caused the illness or death, it's never the vaccine, and the drug company never pays a dime.</p>
<p>If that sounds crazy, it's because it is.</p>

<p>I agree. I don’t normally drink, but had a big glass of wine yesterday and feel like absolute shit today. Can’t imagine drinking every night and how crappy you would feel the next day every day.</p>

        <p>If you can, consider moving to a rural area. This level of paranoia is prevalent mostly in big cities, especially in rich coastal big cities. <br>
Going one step further, if you have retirement money, some useful skills, consider leaving the US altogether.</p>

        <p>You have to pick what you CAN do something about. You don't have to drink beer every night. You can get some home exercise equipment and run in the park. You can make healthy meals and quit drinking. Drinking yourself to death and destroying your health is your own choice, it's not being forced on you.</p>
<p>I had a feeling from the beginning of this that we would be "locked down" until around 2023, so that's been my assumption from the beginning. Don't assume it's going to be magically over anytime soon. Just take care of yourself and don't make things worse by making bad decisions. You are not a helpless victim!</p>

        <p>One thing that might help a bit is to remember that you have each other. You and your spouse are both honest about the reality of the impact of the Covid response, and you can take solace in each other. I know some people who are in marriages where one person has a completely overblown, risk-averse reaction and is behind all government actions, and the other knows that it's ruining live over nothing. That kind of stress is going to create a lot of divorces.   </p>
<p>As for not seeing family, it's hard. But, remember that we're lucky to live in a time and place where you can still see your loved one's face without being with them in person. The restrictions are nonsense, I'm not justifying them. I'm just saying that at least we can still connect with other people digitally, and focusing on that might help lift your spirits.   </p>
<p>Other people have great suggestions about cutting back on drinking, getting into nature, exercising, and limiting how much news about Covid can get to you. You might take a break from Reddit too.</p>

        <p>Never before would you talk down like that to vulnerable people in an opioid epidemic, or vulnerable poor people more likely to drink and smoke cigarettes, or vulnerable race, sexual, and gender minorities who are more likely to have mental health problems. People respond to their environment--poverty, discrimination, isolation. We don't BLAME them we look at the factors and work on alleviating the triggers.

<p>What part of me pointing out that alcoholism is a terrible coping mechanism is elitist to you? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OP has admitted he is not even able to fit into his own clothes. What part of advising him to exercise so he can fit into his clothes again and cross one problem off his list seems elitist to you? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not blaming anyone. I fully understand that OP is sad, and why he is depressed. But i’m telling him with some tough love to snap out of it and take whatever control he can on his life. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I too was extremely depressed at the start of this year during the first lockdowns - i was drinking and smoking weed every single night, and lost so much weight i was skin and bones, and felt nearly suicidal after 4 months of living alone. After lockdown #1 ended i accepted that a second wave will come and that i inflicted upon myself a lot of the misery i had. So i found something healthy to cope. For me it was working out every day as if i were Batman, and cooking a new dish every day. I sure as shit am not coming out of 2020 worse off than i came into it. </p>
<p>My word to both you and to OP is that in these situations, nobody can help you but yourself. So you do you and if you want to drink yourself into a coma, that’s your choice. Just don’t get mad at me for telling you it’s a terrible idea.</p>

        <p>Obviously it's not a good coping issue, they know that... And it is elitist. You don't go to a neighborhood plagued with substance abuse (which is up multiple folds now) and say "guys just try a new dish. It worked for me, it could work for you". When an entire demographic is plagued with something you don't handle it on an individual level. Groups respond to incentives and triggers. You look what is the trigger-- ie levels of isolation that primates cannot live healthily with. And you focus on alleviating the factors, ideally imo you would remove the factors, but you at least don't flat out delegitimize it. </p>
<p>When a group is plagued by racism, you don't go to one of the people and say "dude I studied hard in school (had the luxury of being able to) and got a great job and now I am not poor, you could do it too". No you look at the common factors affecting the group, ie job discrimination, bad schools. You don't look at an outlier in the group and say oh well this guy could do it so they probably should too, they just choose not to. </p>
<p>If you have the luxury of being being able to improve your mental health do not assume others do.</p>

<p>Are you seriously focusing on only one of my points? You know those were just random ass examples of good hobbies you can pick up as opposed to getting drunk right? Fine. Let’s focus on that. The benefits would be (a) a distraction. (B) a new skill and hobby. (C) better standard of living. (D) a new way to possibly make his depressed wife happy. And that’s just ONE of the different coping mechanisms i outlined. There are a plethora of alternatives that don’t involve substance abuse. </p>
<p>If you bothered to read my comment, I clearly said these copes won’t fix the entire problem but it will definitely cross at least one problem off his list of problems and alleviate the pain by providing pleasure. </p>
<p>&rt; And you focus on alleviating the factors, ideally imo you would remove the factors, but you at least don't flat out delegitimize it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Alleviate the factors by finding something better to do than killing your liver, so you can make daily life more bearable. It’s easier said than done, but if you bothered to read my last comment i too endured heavy substance abuse earlier in the year. Nobody helped me but myself to snap out of it. </p>
<p>At least i’m giving him some advice that worked for me, someone who was <em>literally in his same situation earlier this year</em>. </p>
<p>&rt; When a group is plagued by racism, you don't go to one of the people and say "dude I studied hard in school (had the luxury of being able to) and got a great job and now I am not poor, you could do it too". </p>
<p>Well considering exercise and being able to fit into your clothes again (as OP has admitted he can’t fit into his) is a <em>completely</em> different thing than poor minorities being admitted to a top level university, that’s a terrible fucking comparison.</p>

        <p>It's a valid comparison bc we always treat problems that affect groups from the source and not focus on just the individual situations. We always used to talk about health that way. But now that people make money off lockdowns, they have you convinced that these mental health problems are a choice. They are not. Four fold increases in suicide hotline calls did not come from people who chose to be depressed. All of their outlets, safe spaces, and much of their connections are gone. I have seen it in my friends. Some don't have your luxuries of being able to "just pursue a healthy hobby". They need their outlets and communities. No amount of "coping" can fix that for some people. Don't support things that make millions of vulnerable people depressed and then give them coping advice...</p>

<p>They are not. I still have some insecurities and issues that can never be fixed. But at least there are <em>some</em> issues that can be resolved in a straight forward fashion. For example, OP not fitting into his clothes. And if he gets that ticked off the list of things that depress him, it will be a small step in the right direction. And you know it’s contributing to his depression, otherwise he wouldn’t have mentioned it. </p>
<p>Perhaps you never bothered to read my other answers but i also was depressed at the start of the year with substance abuse. I never chose to be depressed, but at least i was able to identify the key factors that contributed to my depression and alleviated that pain. Is the pain entirely gone? No. Do i feel a lot better after stopping alcohol and weed abuse? Yes. </p>
<p>&rt; Some don't have your luxuries of being able to "just pursue a healthy hobby". </p>
<p>What luxury do you need to have to drop on the floor and do push ups? </p>
<p>&rt; No amount of "coping" can fix that for some people. </p>
<p><em>I never said it will fix the whole problem.</em> This is the 3rd time i am telling you that i never fucking said adopting healthy coping mechanisms would fully fix his problem. But at least they would alleviate his pain in the long run. Can you read? </p>

        <p>I'd rather turn into a hopeless alcoholic than be force sterilized with some quickly botched poison made by big pharma ,funded by Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab's  to achieve their depopulation plan. </p>
<p>Regarding drinking ,you can get away with heavy night time drinking for a long time, especially if you have sober days as well. Not that it's advisable ,but in this world if the OP wouldn't have something to take the edge off ,he'd prolly go insane or suicidal. You can't lock ppl in their "cages" for months ,with no sight on end (nothing's gonna change once the wuu staby comes) tell them to ditch everything they held dear and expect them not to develop severe mental issues. Covid related suicide rates in young, healthy population are prolly higher then COVID deaths already.</p>

        <p>Turning yourself into a fat slob might as well make you sterile. It's all about perspective. I'm not going to encourage this guy to make a bad situation worse by feeling sorry for himself.</p>

        <p>Wrong on the 'developed in months'. This vaccine has been in the works since the last SARS virus was around. That is more than 10 years in the real world.</p>
<p>What actually happened was that they finally said "CoVid-19 is a real threat to a huge group of our populace who we want to have around longer, so we have to leave out some of the checks, rechecks, triple checks, quadruple checks, etc. to get this vaccine out as soon as possible!"</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with that considering that they are doing human trials, just sped up ones.</p>
<p>Truth of the vaccine world: If you are going to see a problem with a vaccine, you are going to see it in the first 6 months that a vaccine is being tested.</p>
<p>Not years or decades later.</p>
