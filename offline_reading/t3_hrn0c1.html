        <p>I mean, the film industry is done. Movies are done. Anything that's enjoyable will be destroyed and we'll never go back to how things were. We all know the Democrats love authoritarian control, but the Republicans are just as bad because they are spineless, weak, and continue to allow us to spiral.</p>

        <p>Article, more or less:</p>
<p>&rt; A federal judge on Tuesday denied a request by New Jersey theater owners that would have stopped Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration from enforcing an executive order keeping cinemas dark in the Garden State during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt; In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Brian R. Martinotti rejected a bid from the AMC movie theater chain – which is enduring huge profit losses during the busy summer season – challenging the ongoing shutdown of theaters while churches and similar venues have reopened.</p>
<p>&rt; AMC and several trade groups filed a lawsuit on July 6 against Murphy and Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli, challenging the constitutionality of the continued closure of movie theaters.</p>
<p>&rt; They sought a temporary restraining order that would have stopped the state from enforcing Executive Order 104, which closed theaters and other non-essential businesses.</p>
<p>&rt; “The government-mandated total closure of movie theaters is neither fair nor reasonable,” lawyers for the theater owners wrote, calling it a violation of their First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>&rt; In his ruling, the judge criticized the theater owners for not filing for a temporary restraining order right after Executive Order 104 was issued.</p>
<p>&rt; Martinotti also noted that other states “that initially ordered the re-opening of indoor movie theaters have once again ordered their closure in response to rising COVID-19 infection numbers.”</p>
<p>&rt; The judge gave the state until Aug. 4 to show why an order should not be entered to stop them from requiring the continued closure of theaters or from treating them differently than religious or political indoor gatherings.</p>

        <p>So it's possible the state doesn't give a good enough reason, and the theaters will reopen sometime in August?</p>

        <p><em>Possibly</em>.</p>
<p>But I have a feeling Murphy will just say, "Because rising cases!" and the judge will be like, "Okay."</p>

        <p>This is bullshit.  Next they need to sue for revenue replacement so that the government can pay them the revenue they would be getting at this time.</p>
