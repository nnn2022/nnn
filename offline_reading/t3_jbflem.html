    <strong>What should I do?</strong>
    <p><p>OK guys here's the deal. I have a c section scheduled in 14 days (unfortunately home birth isn't possible, as much as I wish I could). For the last 10 days I've been sick after my kids brought home a bug (much like every other year, it almost seems like masks and shut downs don't work?!!!?)</p>
<p>So by the time I go to hospital, it would have been a minimum of 24 days since I began exhibiting symptoms (so I would have been contagious for some amount of time before showing symptoms so we'd be looking at probably a MONTH from being contagious to going to hospital)</p>
<p>Despite that, and because I foolishly mentioned this flu to my obstetrician, he has ordered a covid test to be taken tomorrow. He didn't seem to have an answer to my question about how this test would be relevant to take now, if it's going to be two weeks before I go to hospital, but alas he's washed his hands of it and said it's hospital policy.</p>
<p>Apparently if I refuse this test, the hospital will assume I'm positive and put me in a plastic bubble and my baby will be taken from me for "observation".</p>
<p>Now keep this in mind that this is in Queensland Australia, in a state where we have ZERO active cases. Obstetrician has also said that once I have the test, it's all done and we're "all good" and I won't need another test. So, I could easily test negative tomorrow, but pick up covid (from who, I have no idea when we have no freaking cases 😂😂😂) but they'll never know because I would have already checked the box of taking the test.</p>
<p>I have no idea how any of this makes sense and I'm not sure what to do.</p></p>

        <p>You did the responsible thing. You have a child to care for. I suppose it’s protocol for them. Doctors and nurses want to care for their patients. But if you feel uncomfortable it’s your right to seek the care you need. You have other children to care for. You can’t be quarantined away from your other children based on fear.</p>

        <p>I think the thing that terrifies me the most is that the only consistency/predictability in this whole thing is that there's NO consistency or predictability, at least here. One day you're told to wear a mask, the next it's fine not to. And not a word about this hospital policy until today? Not a word spoken in the dozens of appointments I've been to prior to today? They just seem to be switching rules on a dime, when the wind shifts. How the hell are people supposed to live with this happening?</p>

        <p>I know it’s unbelievable. I cannot fathom how you feel with a little one so close to coming into this world. We are all stumbling in the darkness with psychopaths leading our way. Just know that people are not out to get you. And you can absolutely slip through the cracks. Just act dumb and don’t submit. If they do something you disagree with you still have the rights to say NO I will no be subjected to that thank you.</p>

        <p>Now that I'm thinking about it more, the other horrific prospect is that if I took it and it was positive (accurate or not), what's to stop police showing up and ordering our whole house to quarantine???? So my husband would miss the birth and my other kids would be ordered to quarantine too.... This sounds like a fucking horror movie but it's a legitimate possibility! And where do I go to get truthful answers from???</p>

        <p>Holy shit that's scary. Best I can suggest is going to another hospital and playing dumb. Since the PCR test can't differentiate a cold from cooties, they will 100% say you're positive. I'm not sure what advice to give but that is an incredibly scary situation and I will pray for you.</p>

        <p>It's ironic that for almost a year, I've managed to dodge this insanity (as much as one can). But now it's come back to bite me in one of the worst ways possible. Where is the cut off for these people? I'm being forced to take a test I already have zero faith in, when there is still potentially almost a MONTH before I could be in hospital? Where's the cut off and who is deciding this? If I had a flu in 2004 does this mean I'd still need to be tested?</p>

        <p>It wouldn’t be the worst thing ever to switch. When I had my son, I don’t remember why this happened, but the OB that I had been established with ended up moving suddenly so I had to find someone new at the last minute. </p>
<p>I was nervous about the switch but everything was totally fine. </p>
<p>Will they allow your partner to be in the room with you while you give birth? </p>
<p>I ask bec my son is now 13, and one of his classes is Home Economics and of course, since it is virtual school, I can sometimes here the teacher lecturing if I am in the room. They are learning about pregnancy, child birth, and caring for newborns. Anywho, she had mentioned that in some cases these days, they only allow the mom, dr, and nurse in the room during delivery bec of covid. </p>
<p>I would be <em>pissed</em> if I couldn’t have my husband with me. I would certainly find a way around it if I knew that was a possibility.</p>

        <p>FWIW, my mother's friend had symptoms that seemed like COVID and tested negative, then was diagnosed with another infection by a doctor and got antibiotics for it. So yours very well could come out negative, even though the test is faulty.</p>

        <p>This is the problem though, when trust is broken, how can anything really be trusted again? To me, that is by far the most damaging scar that all of this is going to leave. We are supposed to be able to trust people and we have been/are being shown time and again that we can't do that (for multiple reasons that we all know and are frequently highlighted in this sub)</p>

        <p>Yeah, now I feel like I can never trust anyone who referred to people who don't wear masks or stay home all the time as dangerous again (even though some of those people used to be my friends).</p>

        <p>I haven’t been to Australia in years so I don’t know their rules, but can you somehow get to another state? I’ve heard NT and WA haven’t been as bad with restrictions but it’s hard to tell unless you have family or friends there. I think travel between states is restricted too. Maybe try and get to a more rural town with a decent hospital? Like I said, I haven’t been back there in years so I don’t know if that’s possible. </p>
<p>I’m pregnant too and I live in the USA. My husband is Australian and my mom is too. Anyways, I’m having my baby in a state that doesn’t require masks and will separate me from my twins. I know it’s easier for me because our states are closer together than yours, but I was really trying to avoid something bad happening. I don’t know what I would do if I am separated from my kids.</p>

        <p>It's almost certain that I'll be going to another hospital now. Which at 36 weeks pregnant is just disgraceful, because I had built a good rapport with this doctor (big mistake) and it's a major hospital with allegedly one of the best neonatal care units in the country. I am just astounded that I am being forced to choose and gamble between my health, my baby's, and my other children's well-being, all for a flu I'll be more than likely completely over before I go anywhere near a hospital.</p>
<p>Still just trying to digest it all.</p>

        <p>You're doing great!! Don't feel anxious, if you were getting a surgery they would have tested you anyway. The establishment in America tests everyone who is having a surgery here. I doubt there would be any way for you to get out of a covid test.</p>
<p>You're going to have to go all in here. Don't be scared. Have a plan, demand 3 separate tests from separate samples if you come up positive. Make it clear that separation from your child is against your permission under any circumstances.</p>
<p>If you've had kids in the hospital previously this is a dragon you have slayed before. Shite treatment of new mothers and babies is nothing new in the medical system, and you're a hero for continuing the human race.</p>
<p>Eyes on the prize baby, Congratulations, and thank you for bringing more children into the world.</p>

        <p>This is my issue. If it is positive (false or otherwise), my family will be put into forced quarantine.. My husband has only just secured new work after this fantastic lunacy of the world meant he lost his last job. We have 7 children who would all need to quarantine. I had an abusive childhood and have not a single family member's help. Same for my husband. We have no friends who we are close enough with to ask to deliver food and medicine to us for 14 days. In all likelihood, my husband would lose this new job too. This puts us at legitimate homelessness and giving up our children. So no, it's not just "get the test done". At least not in my life.</p>
