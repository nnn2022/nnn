<title>The life expectancy in my country (Ireland) is 82. Can someone tell me how this is a lockdown-worthy virus? How severe are the long-term effects for young people? They're the only reason that this should even be considered. An 84 year old dying is sad, but it doesn't mean the world should shut down.</title>

        <p>Because idiots think getting 84 year olds to live for 2 months longer is worth taking everyone's freedom and happiness away, and people are selfish for calling this out.</p>
<p>And the only way this affects young (and healthy) people is through these awful lockdowns which take out futures and all hope away. The futures and opportunities that the vast majority of those calling for lockdowns have already had. It is truly disgusting.</p>

        <p>The ones calling for a lockdown live in gated property and attend jet setting vacations while the working class spends life savings and cancels mood boosting activities. Nice</p>

        <p>The parent comment may be an exaggeration, but I think it is fair to say that those calling for lockdown (on the most part) do not see the side effects. Most of them can work from home (or are on furlough, having others pay for their existance), don't go outside much anyway, are happy using Zoom etc. for social interaction, and don't have a problem with social isolation.</p>
<p>I think that's what he is trying to get at.</p>

        <p>That's fair and probably accurate.  That said I could live happily sitting right here in front of my PC never going out.  But I recognize it's unhealthy and I like my jobs.  But if the government wanted to give me $100k a year to replace what I work for and let me sit here jerking off I'd have to give it serious consideration ;)</p>

<p>But thanks for not attacking people here for no reason (like some like to do, unfortunately), you've seem quite respectful. And as I always say, I'm sure if you did want to have a debate here, 90% of the people would respectfully engage with you too :)</p>

        <p>Hey I love a good respectful debate and an an exchange of ideals.  True intellectual honesty is not only the respect of but the solicitation of views that may oppose your own.  It's very obvious how I feel about this current situation but we're all yelling at each other.  Why not try to figure out how to co exist instead of telling each other how to live?  As long as someone approaches me respectfully and intelligently and doesn't try to shove their opinion down my throat I'm willing to listen and retort  :)</p>

        <p>Yeah I think I have a good idea how u feel about it all haha!</p>
<p>But I agree with you 100%, screaming at each other doesn't progress anything. It's the same with people (admitably on both sides) calling each other science deniers etc. The best way to progress politically, as well as scientifically, is to listen to the other side and rebut intelligently, rather than hurling slurs at each other. All screaming and slurring does is devolve the debate into a tribal battle of monkey shit throwing which is just major cringe.</p>
<p>Although saying that, I can understand why people get upset when talking about this issue. Some people on my side get angry at major infringements on civil liberties (which I also get upset about, because it is an upsetting subject), and some people on the other side believe those on my side are killing people (which is also upsetting), but I think it shows great things about someone's personality when they can put emotion to one side and have a good debate (not to toot my own horn haha).</p>

        <p>You do realise that we have the HIGHEST cases per million here in Ireland right? We have a population with alot of old people, there have been long term effects on as young as 16 and the most long term effects affect people in their 30s-60s which is literally the majority of our population, thelong term effects include, permanent lung damage in the form of internal tissue scarring, chronic fatigue, nerve damage (this has in a few cases actually crippled people, but it mostly just causes severe pains that remain for months) just to name a few and I'm no expert but none of those are things ANYONE is willing to get for the fun of it, these all affect the majority of our population and I know it seems unrelated to your post but what I'm try to show you is that death isnt the only thing this virus causes, those deaths are people aswell and no one wants to lose those people its suck that all this is happening but we have a vaccine and the were scheduled to have vaccinated enough of our population in Ireland to let things return to normal. So TLDR vivid effects us in different ways not just with death</p>

        <p>"Long term Covid" is an overblown topic and used by MSM to scare us more and generate clicks. I think the long term effects are rarer than is made out. Like how MSM focuses on the one child that dies and tries to convince us there is a high risk to children.</p>
<p>All of the destruction to society and misery caused from lockdowns is not justified.</p>

        <p>What drives me even more crazy are people that believe they will suffer in the long run if they get COVID even if they experienced no symptoms right now. If you’re not experiencing anything right now, I doubt you will have issues in the future and even if you did, you can surely suffer from long term side effects of other illnesses, COVID isn’t unique to this. And heck, if you’re that worried about suffering in the future, might as well quit all of your bad behaviors like drinking, smoking, eating unhealthy, etc. right now.</p>
