    <strong>It's ass backwards that healthy people have to get vaccinated to protect those who are immunocompromised.</strong>
    <p><p>Shouldn't those with under-functioning immune systems be the ones taking the highly safe and effective vaccines? Why should I take it when my immune system works JUST FINE as demonstrated in March of last year when I did catch covid with 0 complications. </p>
<p>Why should I take a vaccine to lower my chance of being hospitalized when I already have an incredibly low risk of it in the first place. </p>
<p>What is the difference between someone naturally immune and someone immune via vaccination when it comes to being a petri dish for variants? Does anyone want to talk about over use of antibiotics breeding super bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics?? Could that have been avoided if everyone took antibiotics at the same exact time? And then as a population we would never have to worry about bacteria ever again? </p>
<p>I'm healthy, I don't need this vaccine overriding my body's natural defense system that has already proven itself to be quite capable tyvm. Or am I a clown?? Does natural immunity no longer exist?? When did that come to be?</p>
<p>Edit: "there are people who can't get it. Period. What is so hard to understand?" It's really not that hard to understand. Thats my point. Why can't manufacturers create a vaccine that they CAN take. Why is that so hard to understand?</p>
<p>Sort of unrelated but since I'm venting: this is the result of western medicine indoctrinating the population into believing their health is out of their hands. No, no, you're not healthy. You have to take this shot so you can be healthy. And if you are healthy, you still have to take this shot to protect those who aren't healthy. Capice?</p></p>

        <p>I just got news today that a young healthy guy I know had seizures immediately after taking the vaccine. I'll just pile that on the hundred other reasons I'm not taking it.</p>

        <p>Shhh...Stop thinking for yourself. You’re making too much sense. </p>
<p>It’s the same argument they made with masks: it’s not about you! It’s about others. </p>
<p>Breaking news: No need for masks and vaccines when your immune system will prevent you from getting sick in the first place. Sounds crazy, right?</p>

        <p>It infuriates me. I can’t get my head around expecting a fit and healthy individual to potentially risk their health to protect someone not fit and healthy enough to fight off a mild virus. </p>
<p>It’s like they want to reduce everyone to the lowest common denominator. </p>
<p>As a fit and healthy individual, not a fucking chance I’ll be sacrificing myself!</p>

        <p>I fully agree. As much as I believe we ought to show compassion and mercy on others, I draw a hard line when "they" say that means giving up my bodily autonomy. We are responsible for our own bodies and the health thereof.</p>

        <p>Incredibly well put. I am fully behind compassion, empathy, and humans working together for the betterment of society. And that's why I find this whole predicament so unsettling.</p>
<p>Listen, I really believe humans are good hearted. I believe we all want the same thing. We want everything to go back to "normal" (although I think that we should aspire to be better than how we were living pre pandemic) I think everyone just has different opinions on how we can get there. At the end of the day, nothing will change if we can't have real discourse. And I think the name calling, assumptions, and most compellingly, the censorship, is a BIG obstacle blocking us from a healthy society.</p>

        <p>I think the fact that we got to where we are in less than a year demonstrates that humans aren't inherently good. Don't get me wrong, I hear what you're saying. I come from a Christian worldview, so I'm convinced we're all sinful, but I do understand how people are capable of possessing morals and making sound judgements in spite of that. That's why so many people are opposed to the tyranny, but it also explains why the majority follow like sheep to their slaughter. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, you're right, we all (mostly) want to get back to normal, besides those who have turned into germophobes. Freedom to choose must reign supreme, or else we go back to dumbass civilization mode where one group is treated with prejudice or as inferior. It's like ideology is the new race.</p>
