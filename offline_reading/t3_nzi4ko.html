        <p>I understand his frustration and passion for the topic.</p>
<p>If you watched the video, he said he knows someone in the Biden admin, and submitted evidence to them.  Nothing.  And then tried to give it to Nancy Pelosi's staff only to be met with, "You probably think nothing happened on 1/6."</p>

        <p>Every single one of my Facebook conversations turns into this.</p>
<p>Usually what happens is about six people from the Loser Side come in and start calling me names, screaming about how "stupid" I am, yelling about "killing grandma", how I should just "shut up", how much of an "asshole" I am, how "cruel" it is to be talking about obesity, how "brainwashed" I am (even though I'm literally the only person arguing in this direction vs six in the other), and how they don't care somehow if I die.</p>
<p>Not one mentions the actual content.</p>
<p>That speaks volumes.</p>

        <p>Here it is: We are looking at a 0.71% Absolute Risk Reduction in getting COVID (for Pfizer) based on their Phase 3 clinical trial. But today, the chance of getting COVID is much much lower since so many people have been vaccinated (some of whom have died to save society)... the benefit is now miniscule....a inconvenient truth that the government doesn't tell you.  is this worth losing your life over? Tess Lawrie's report independently confirmed we should STOP these vaccines NOW. NOBODY can explain the cause of the excess deaths of thousands of American lives (minimum 5,000 and could be 50,000). I talked to the people behind OpenVAERS... they estimated the death toll at 20,000 people and they were very concerned about data missing from VAERS... records that have been secretly removed, and how over 200,000 recordid's have gone missing... that's nearly 20% of all the records.</p>
<p>The proper testing wasn't done. The spike protein is more dangerous than we thought. Animal toxicology studies were never done. </p>
<p>People were DROPPED from the Phase 3 trials if they had a reaction to the first dose. Dose escalation studies were never done. The vaccine LNP accumulates in the ovaries. The rate of spontaneous abortion was 82% in the Phase 3 trial (vs. 10% normal rate) for &lt;20 weeks with babies being severely mutilated. Vaccine victims voices are being censored. Paramedics and docs are afraid to speak out against the narrative or risk being fired. There is NO transparency: the government is NOT telling us the actual # of deaths. They are not acknowledging the 50X increase in myocarditis and pericarditis in teenagers. </p>
<p>We are being told it is a "safe" vaccine so adverse effects are attributed to another cause so it looks to everyone like nothing is wrong. There is deliberate suppression of early treatments. Ivermectin systematic review was in front of NIH for 3 months and they did NOTHING. Now will be published in peer reviewed journal shortly. Google is allowing Gavi to run ads trashing ivermectin. Facebook is DELETING vaccine side effect groups of 200,000 users and getting away with it. YouTube is continuing to remove ivermectin videos and not censoring videos saying the vaccine is perfectly safe for kids, pregnant women, and those who already have covid. The government never shows a risk benefit analysis. There is no informed consent. </p>
<p>They changed OSHA laws so employers don't have to record adverse events so nobody finds out how unsafe the vaccines are: https://trialsitenews.com/osha-waves-29-cfr-1904s-recording-requirements-so-employers-that-mandate-vaccines-have-no-need-to-record/ </p>
<p>See https://trialsitenews.com/does-the-21st-century-cures-act-allow-the-government-to-bypass-informed-consent-for-experimental-vaccines/   </p>
<p>These are the issues the comments should be addressing..... what are WE going to do about it? Debate how rude I was?  Lesson about my behavior heard loudly. </p>
<p>Please, can we get back to the issues with the vaccine and the deliberate suppression of early treatment options and the deliberate changing of laws to avoid transparency? </p>
<p>Each of you can help get the message out. I'll work on a 5 minute video, professionally done, that you can share. </p>
<p>Twitter just wiped out the C19 Evidence -Based Clinical Response panel today. See https://twitter.com/louisaclary/status/1403143282562064384</p>
<p>If you agree with me, please join me at https://vaccinevictims.locals.com/. I'll post there the URL of digestable materials for you to consider sharing. It is free to join. There is a mobile app as well. Sorry to give you one more app, but with all the censorship, locals allows us to communicate without being throttled or censored. With 100,000 members, we will build a base of concerned citizens who can speak out about the issues I've raised above.</p>

        <p>There is 100% conclusive evidence that the virus’s escape from China was deliberate.  The Chinese admit they stopped the infected traveling within China and allowed them to travel internationally.</p>
<p>That decision weaponised the virus. The world has to respond or forever be at the mercy of Chinese attack.</p>

        <p>Well, yeah. Whether or not the stuff got out of the lab deliberately, it's 100% that they looked at what was going on in the city of Wuhan and said, "Hell no, this isn't going to be just us."</p>

        <p>If you watch the videos he links to, Chris Martenson goes over the relevant emails. Fauci seems to genuinely act in panic at first hearing about it. As in, "oh shit, this is all going to be my fault. Everybody listen up."</p>
<p>At least where Fauci is concerned, the lab leak appears accidentally. </p>
<p>It's impossible to speak for the Chinese involvement as they've been completely silent.</p>
<p>Evidence as we know now at the very least implicates an accidental release and a cover up.</p>
<p>It could be more, but these guys tend to role with the hard evidence and leave speculation for the future. It makes them more factual and harder to dismiss, so I respect it.</p>
<p>That being said, I think it's naive to ignore the evidence this may have been planned:</p>

        <p>Well put. Maybe he was saying "oh shit, how much do they know?", or maybe it was "oh shit, look what they've done with my work", or like you say, maybe it was just "oh shit, this is going to be my fault."</p>
<p>As far as compelling circumstantial evidence, the global rollout of covid "measures" and the fact that they used said measures to get Trump out of office, the 4 years of the psychological conditioning necessary for people to accept all this, the war games and Rockafeller Foundation document, and much more....it's convincing that it was released intentionally. The only remaining question for me as far as Fauci is concerned is how much did he know.
The guy is not the sharpest tool in the shed so it's probable that he simply wasn't in the loop with the plans.</p>

        <p>I'm more in the camp that big tech knew. </p>
<p>Zuckerberg leaped into action almost immediately, eager to help them push their message forward. And they accepted. Private industry censorship is no longer private industry when they do it in collusion with the government, which we have Faucis emails proving.</p>
<p>That's what is scary. The government is using pawns to censor on its behalf. I think the thing we must realize is 99% of these politicians are just bribe puppets. The true powers are the tech giants and the 1% pulling their strings. Even where I live, Canada where politicians can't take lobbying money, they instead setup charities and recueve it from there. Like WeCharity. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-the-we-charity-scandal-was-about-a-lot-more-than-conflict-of-interest/</p>
<p>We live in an oligarchy that's disguised as a democracy. </p>
<p>It's possible, more than likely actually, that the true organizations running the show would keep people in the dark until they're needed.</p>
<p>Event201 suggests a dry run, then everybody went home.</p>
<p>Then the virus leaked, and they're like "are we doing this?" and it seems the consensus was yes.</p>
<p>So, if it was purposefully released, that tells us China is in the mix. </p>
<p>Accidental seems to indicate that China was just a tool in their toolset.</p>

        <p>I agree with most of what he says here and I think he wasn't even being that much of an asshole in the video... But, it is not an ad hominem 'attack' if the criticism is that the person isn't listening, is interrupting, basically just having poor debate etiquette... That is a perfectly valid reason to criticize someone's argument.</p>

        <p>I joined r/lockdownskeptics Spring 2020 because they were...skeptics. And I, a Liberty. I now find myself more at NNN, and just saw an interesting postings where LS claims that "antivaxxers, conspiracy theorists and Covid deniers moved to NNN" because "we at LS take moderation seriously". Unbelievable. </p>
<p>I've read the Pfizer docs. They didn't even report what cycle PCR test they used to confirm a positive Covid-19 test! Testing itself was at the discretion of the researcher, so not done across the control group. Not only that, they didn't test both groups for antibodies before and after trials. </p>
<p>It's not me, serious scientists and physicians have pointed out weaknesses and the low absolute risk efficacy. Media tells you 95% but the number is indeed 0.71% and this was first observed by molecular biologists and researchers. </p>
<p>LS hardly ever post critical thinking or studies not even AIER's excellent article: If you've had Covid, you may not need the vaccine. And studies on T-cell mediated antibodies. They're posting on openings and nothing about SCIENCE.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm really disappointed with LS. I used to post and read that sub more than this one, but they stopped posting a lot of the scientific analysis and started focusing on reopening more. At this point in the game, I honestly don't understand how anyone can deny that something extremely big and shady is going on. If they want to consider people like me "conspiracy theorists" so be it. I think it's kind of absurd. The people being labeled that are the ones actually asking appropriate questions, in my view.</p>

        <p>There were several times when watching the video that I became REALLY annoyed with Steve's behavior. But I also felt his frustration. I share his frustration. Even though his interrupting and talking over people irritated me and made me cringe, I can't say that I wouldn't have behaved in much the same way given the time constraints and the importance of the information. It seems like Steve has been trying his damnedest to get this information out there, and to get help from those in a position to make change, and he's been thwarted at every turn. He has every reason to feel very passionately about this situation, and I hope he continues to fight. Also, I REALLY hope Dark Horse will do another segment with Steve and Dr. Malone that's a bit more structured or at least more formally moderated. I know that's not how Dark Horse normally rolls (and I love their usual rambling style!) but a second round of more structured content with those two guests would be most excellent.

        <p>I'm open minded to this but find it hard to accept that no medical professionals bring this up at all.  Are there no spike proteins found in people with "Covid"? Does the gene therapy create these spikes?  How would the virus not existing at all be so hidden?</p>
