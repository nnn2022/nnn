    <strong>Most people aren’t part of the reddit hivemind</strong>
    <p><p>This is something i have to remind myself when i get too demoralized. Reddit is a hivemind filled with shut-in, far-left circlejerking geeks.</p>
<p>The real world is different. Most people arent like that, especially once you leave the big cities. They wont demand the cops violently beat you for not wearing a mask. Or that they bust your door down for that halloween party you had. We have a long fight ahead, but things are nowhere near as bad as r/coronavirus would have you believe</p></p>

        <p>It doesn't really matter if the "real world" is different.</p>
<p>Governments listen to two things: The loudest special interest groups (who tend to have a big social media presence), and whomever is funding their campaigns (usually the same special interest groups, through fake "charities" or "foundations").</p>
<p>And governments - both our elected officials and our massive bureaucracies - are packed with <em>those who believe in the same agendas.</em></p>
<p>What the majority wants is of no consequence - be it about BLM, the economy, the election, or the 'Rona. Unless there is an actual armed revolt, or the tax dollars stop flowing.</p>
<p>And those who simply acquiesce to tyranny are just as guilty as those who openly support it.</p>

<p>no no no, governments are run by criminal traitors, that follow a centrally given out script as we can see as basically ALL governments follow the same dystopian nightmare of slave masks, lockdowns, useless tests, push of vaccines.</p>
<p>while yes there is a huge financial interest and those actors called politicians will get a lot of money and stuff behind the scenes and  in the front too, BUT this is the main thing at play.</p>
<p>they are following a centralized script.</p>
<p>you don't appeal to traitors, you remove them form office and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>most all governments are run by traitors and they never cared about you or any of us.</p>
<p>a lot are also psychopaths and enjoy the torture and murder of people. one example would be hilary clinton, as she laughs when she heard about the murder of an actual beloved leader  libya's gadaffi.</p>
<p>they find it hilarious to see us suffer and die and enjoy it all.</p>
<p>you don't appeal to a psychopathic monster, you remove that monster and make sure it can't ever harm another being.</p>

        <p>We agree; we are just saying the same thing differently.</p>
<p>Indeed you are correct - the special interest groups have been incited and set to their tasks (and are funded, like BLM/AntiFa/enviro groups) by a cabal of globalists who have no loyalty to any country and want NWO (ie Soros, the tech moguls, etc). Politicians don't get to where they are without showing they will go along with the agenda.</p>
<p>This does, of course, make them traitors - 100 years ago, someone like the odious Justin Trudeau would have been shot for his deliberate attempts to undermine his own country.</p>
<p>The path we are set on has been in play since at least the early 20th Century (Frankfurt School, Koudhoeve-Kalergi, Fabians), and has been normalized to the plebs through stealth co-opting of education, the media, entertainment, and of course, politics.</p>
<p>And no, they will not just quietly go away - they will likely have to be removed by force...</p>

        <p>This applies to social media in general which, in my opinion, is a big part of the insane overreaction to Covid.   People stay connected 24/7 to others with a similar point of view and your world becomes a giant echo chamber.   Once you turn off your devices and take a walk outside, you realize the online world is just a very small part of reality.</p>

        <p>From my experience the vast majority; both friends, family and students supports the lockdown and restrictions. They sees the virus as dangerous and are afraid of putting too much strain on the hospitals. They think without restrictions too many laypeople will get infected, infect medical staff and the medical staff may infect patients in hospitals risking to kill them. They fear no lockdown would delay treatments.</p>
<p>I don't support lockdown, but vast majority of people around me does. So, what the real world is depends on the area you lives in.</p>

        <p>The police don't have to enforce these "laws" (which actually are not laws at all).</p>
<p>Businesses and random Karens/Kens are doing it for them - for free.</p>
<p>This is how tyranny works; the enforcement arms of the state can't be everywhere all the time, so they rely on virtue signallers and those who seek personal power and gain by proving their "loyalty" by ratting out their neighbours.</p>
<p>This is why when revolutions happen, low level collaborators often meet an even worse fate than government functionaries - they are literally strung up by their own neighbours.</p>

        <p>The “enforcement” you describe is almost entirely in people’s heads.</p>
<p>I haven’t worn a mask once this whole time. Shopping, flying, eating out. Never once.</p>
<p>I was at Wal-Mart today, and indeed, most of the sheep are still wandering around with masks strapped to their faces, frightened as ever.</p>
<p>Either they’re frightened of getting “sick,” or frightened of getting scolded. Impossible to tell what that ratio really is.</p>
<p>The fact remains though, the “enforcement” is a largely bunch of phony baloney nonsense.</p>
<p>This particular flavor of psychosis and tyranny has relied on the <em>obedience of the foolish</em> far more than any “enforcement.”</p>

        <p>I do think that one awesome thing that came from Biden winning is that they will do one more giant lockdown and then it won't be important anymore. It's very clear this was for mail-in ballots. The crying babies got their bottle (no more Trump), so they have no need to push this agenda anymore.</p>

        <p>Biden won't have the authority to do "one giant lock down". It's up to the individual Governors in the States. There recommendations are all over the place. Some States are locked down now and others like Florida nothing is closed. Southern States have large number of gun owners and it would be very difficult to lock those States down. The U.S. is one of the most armed populations in the World.</p>

I know not everyone can make it out to protests, I know not everyone really knows there rights in regard to mask wearing, lock downs or anything.

        <p>Reddit doesn't have much time left to live. Many online platforms in the early 2000s died because they got a psychotic mod trying to 'keep the place civil' and overdoing it, chasing all content creators away. </p>
<p>Now you hear what, Trump is banned in Twitter? Well, not officially banned, but his posts are now flagged. Mods in early 2000s also practiced that: on a dying forum a mod wouldn't ban you because you create clicks, but they still disagreed with you, so they would put a forced flare 'this person says total BS' on your posts. None of these forums have survived to this day. People hate that.</p>
<p>They've overdone the censorship on social media for the sake of the elections. This will hurt reddit, twitter and facebook. I am not changing my opinion because a Reddit mod has banned me, I'll just take my clicks elsewhere. Actually, being banned/shadowbanned for not supporting Joe Biden will probably only solidify your political position.</p>

        <p>I was on the Coronavirus sub when I saw this post  "Most people aren’t part of the reddit hivemind" and  was interested.  But after reading the post and the comments, I was surprised.</p>
<p>The left and the right are basically saying the exact same thing, but each is pointing a finger at the other.</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt; Reddit is a hivemind filled with shut-in, far-left circlejerking geeks.  </p>
<p>If you changed far-left to far-right, this same post would be upvoted by left-leaning folks.</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt; This applies to social media in general which, in my opinion, is a big part of the insane overreaction to Covid. People stay connected 24/7 to others with a similar point of view and your world becomes a giant echo chamber. Once you turn off your devices and take a walk outside, you realize the online world is just a very small part of reality.</p>
<p>Left believe the same thing, but change the words "overreaction to Covid" to "Covid hoax conspiracy theory."</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt;  I sometimes forget that twitter isn’t an accurate reflection of what all people believe.</p>
<p>This statement is true and would be upvoted by just about anyone, no matter what their beliefs.</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt; In other words, the majority of the tweeters are bots, paid astroturfers . . </p>
<p>Again, I think most people on both sides would agree with that statement.  But the people on the left think the bots and paid propagandists are spreading right-wing disinformation, while the right thinks the left is spreading it.</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt; This is how tyranny works; the enforcement arms of the state can't be everywhere all the time, so they rely on virtue signallers and those who seek personal power and gain by proving their "loyalty" by ratting out their neighbours.</p>
<p>Another statement that could come from either side.  Look at cold war "red scare."  </p>
<p>\&rt;&rt; This is why when revolutions happen.</p>
<p>Both sides.</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt; Governments listen to two things: The loudest special interest groups (who tend to have a big social media presence), and whomever is funding their campaigns (usually the same special interest groups, through fake "charities" or "foundations").  And governments - both our elected officials and our massive bureaucracies - are packed with those who believe in the same agendas.</p>
<p>Both sides.  I find that most people neither like nor trust politicians or bureaucrats.  I also don't know anyone who believes that the government should be influenced corporate special interest groups.  </p>
<p>The wealthy elite will have no trouble maintaining their power by keeping Americans divided and distracted, pointing fingers at each other instead of at them.  They are above politics.</p>
