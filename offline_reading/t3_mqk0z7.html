    <strong>It’s occurred to me, the the new virtue of ‘strength’ is now saying yes to whatever’s going on around you.</strong>
    <p><p>Not giving any resistance. Just agreeing with the majority is seen now as the “strong, bold move”.  Whereas the old virtue of saying ‘no, wait a minute, let’s think about this” is now somehow seen as weak. Saying no is and has always has been powerful.  The “No, I’m mad as hell and I’m not gonna take it anymore!!” attitude is being perverted into some kind of an invalid point of view.</p>
<p>Yet this actual virtue, saying no, is what has advanced every privilege (Rights) that we have today. Fighting back. Not for advantage, but for the equity of everyone. Not to impose but to protect. Ultimately to defend.</p></p>

        <p>The people agreeing with everything believe that they are the resistance. They believe they are rebelling against the evil system and that they are supporting reason, science and logic. The media has done a fine job of creating boogiemen everywhere. Always a finger to point at someone.</p>
<p>It is hard to go against the flow. It can make life very lonely. It can cost you your job, support network and more. At least we haven't gone full inquisition yet. Most people are risk-averse. Even if they have some reservations about what's happening, they will stick to their routines and do whatever they're told. Or, if they really put themselves on the line, they'll say, "somebody needs to do something!"</p>

        <p>Yes it's gaslighting... "You're too fragile to accept..." So you are weak for standing up for what you believe.  Ok that sounds a bit backwards.</p>
