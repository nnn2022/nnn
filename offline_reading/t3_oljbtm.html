    <strong>Welp, my mother is feeling like shit after she got the shot, and I'm kinda sorta pissed.</strong>
    <p><p>Total Rant: I'm worried that my elderly mother, who was feeling fine before her shots, is now sleeping more and feeling like crap. She already had a heart issue, but for someone approaching 80, she wasn't too bad. Pretty good in fact. She'd sleep like a normal person, and do her day to day activities as usual.</p>
<p>I'm not angry at her. She did what she thought was the right thing and it's not my place to tell her what to do or think. </p>
<p>I'm angry at the fucking system, the MSM, all levels of government that have pushed this plandemic experimental injection (not gonna call it a vaccine since it's not working) on people. Broadcasting the doom and gloom message non-stop for almost 2 years. </p>
<p>I'm angry at the cutsie-poo cartoons of NPC's  wearing their masks, or drawings of people looking glad as shit to get their shot.  I'm angry at the bombardment of propaganda about the DEADLIEST DISEASE EVER. I was burnt out before, now I'm pissed.</p>
<p>I now plan to tell anyone who demands I get the shot to go fuck themselves, followed by me mocking them as hard and as fast as I can. </p>
<p>Fuck the jab, fuck the government, and fuck anyone who still wears a mask outside surrounded by nobody or in their car while driving alone. You (government, sheep, etc) are all a bunch of idiots and I hate you with a passion. </p>
<p>Rant Over... for now. Also, can there be a flair called "SCAM"? It'd fit this post perfectly.</p></p>

        <p>My parents, who are 68/69, did the same thing. I told them please wait at least until we know how it will affect people. </p>
<p>The crazy part is my parents could see through the bullshit even before they got the shot! When I challenge them on that, they revert to "the script" as I call it; they just parrot the news. </p>
<p>But those two bits of info cannot exist simultaneously. </p>
<p>If you can see through the bullshit, you had nothing to fear. If you're afraid, then how do you see through the shit?</p>
<p>It's so dissonant. </p>
<p>After my Dad, a really intelligent and logical man, had issues from it, I told him it was short-sighted and dumb to get an experimental vaccine with no known injury rates to not even prevent against something with known, extremely low rates of serious injury. His response? </p>
<p>"Well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion."</p>
<p>I really hope your mom pulls through alright. These people were taken advantage of like mad.</p>

        <p>If I didn’t know any better I’d think you were talking about my parents. When my dad had heart issues after getting it, his response was “well, just part of aging!” I am livid at the system. Fuck the media and all their propaganda bullshit they’re putting out too. </p>
<p>I really didn’t even think about my parents before because I assumed with their stances on everything they wouldn’t get it, but the propaganda got to them and they were like “well, we’re older so it can’t hurt!” There’s a lot of us in the same boat, doesn’t make it better though.</p>
<p>Oh, side note it could be placebo but the whole pine tree tea actually <em>did</em> make me feel a noticeable difference from the fluish feeling I’ve had ever since everyone started getting the shots. Idk if it would help people who actually got it though, I told my mom to take it anyway. The way the Suramin works with the spike proteins is really interesting.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>How long along did get the shot? Did she get both shots?</p>
<p>You may want to look into her thyroid levels as well as things like vit d, b12 and iron. </p>
<p>It's possible the shots messed with her thyroid. </p>
<p>Of you want more information, feel free to DM me.</p>
