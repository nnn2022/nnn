    <p><p>Also, how are we still alive to not only asymptomatically survive it as it festers in our heretical bodies, but also spread it without so much as a cough? ðŸ¤¡  </p>
<p>Gee, almost like our immune system didn't just suddenly fall off the face of the Earth in March 2020/January 2021.</p>
<p>Also, you guys want to have a conversation regarding the term "endemic"? Or did your short-term memory fail you again? </p>
<p>Important reminders on that note, just to jog your memory a bit:</p>
<ol>
<li>At one point, 100% of people were unvaccinated</li>
<li>"My body, my choice"</li>
<li>It's been 1.5 years, and not only have 7.8 billion people still lived to witness history actively repeat itself within that time frame (whether they were aware of it or not), but a number of nurses have felt the need to dance in the middle of a DEADLY VENTILATOR-GUARANTEED pandemic AND post it to TikTok AND quit their jobs due to injection mandates at their workplace. Gee, it's almost like, this pathogen actually does has a 99.9% survival rate and there's something fishy with this situation</li>
<li>Sweden's population hasn't spontaneously dropped dead</li>
<li>It's my DECISION to make, not your platform to bandwagon on Neo-Fascist mandates, laws, and censorship only for you to circlejerk and bully us whilst giving you a false sense of moral superiority when in actuality it is anything but</li>
<li>The only thing that has changed within the past 1.5 years is rollout of new injectible technology to be fought against a virus that scientists refuse to isolate, and the synchronous correlation of wealth transfer, government requiring mandates, passports, halting of the economy as a whole, censorship, the coining and priming of the term "New Normal" rather than "Go back to normal", and time and trued directed fear-mongering via MSM</li>
<li>FUCK OFF ALREADY</li>
