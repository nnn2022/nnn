    <strong>School time fun</strong>
    <p><p>You know what's fun, taking your kid 6 year old to school, forgetting her face diaper at home and then the principal who gate keeps the front door stopping her and infront of all her peers he says, "Oh oh why don't you have a mask like all your friends"</p>
<p>He then signals me over and says "does she not have a mask today?". </p>
<p>To which I reply, "Ya we just forgot to put one in her bag today". Literally the first time she's forgotten her virtue signaling device at home. </p>
<p>He says, "Well better go home and get her one then".</p>
<p>I blankly stared at him while my daughter stared up at me. I sat like this until his face started to show confusion, so not long. Then I said, "No, she will go in and you guys can get her a mask. She isn't losing MORE education because of your fears"</p>
<p>He is a nice guy and I felt bad talking to him like that, but man have I had enough. He brought her in and got her a mask.</p></p>

        <p>I suppose but both me and my wife are blue collar and both of us laid off indefinitely because of covid slow down. So we've been discussing home schooling while we are laid off. But the problem there is then our child looses ANY social interaction with other kids because children are now taught to be afraid of another child because they might kill them with covid.</p>

        <p>That’s not true at all. We started homeschooling at the beginning of CoVid and our children have more social interaction than homeschool kids. We have meet ups and activities, mask free, 3 days a week. Our kids have normal pre CoVid style interaction. </p>
<p>I get that finances can make it difficult, but I assure you, there’s a way, and it’s worth trying.</p>

<p>You're right though, I'm such a fool for falling for this plandemic that "tHe MeDiA" invented, along with every world leader and infectious disease experts across the globe. It's hard to get international cooperation on anything, but when it comes to manufacturing a crisis just to make people wear masks, they sure pulled it off!</p>
<p>I should probably try getting more of my info from Aunt Karen on Facebook or the masterminds over at YouTube. That's the good stuff!</p>

        <p>That's a bit drastic, no need to uproot my kids life because of the principals comments. They should just be teaching kids that wearing a mask isn't normal. That while yes its something we have to do, that it won't be like this forever. I get that masks are dumb, but kids don't grasp what's happening yet. So explain that while yes we have to wear a mask, it isn't normal and won't be forever. </p>
<p>Maybe this way kids won't feel like this is normal life.</p>

        <p>That school seems like a microcosm of the obedience driven agenda that’s corroding our society. It’s the reason we’re talking in this sub right now.</p>
<p>If the principal has the nerve to put your child in such an uncomfortable situation in front of you, I can’t imagine the type of pressure and programming that’s being forced down your kid’s throat when you’re not there to step in. </p>

        <p>That's how I feel too. I want nothing more than to take mine out, but he'd rather wear the mask than be away from his friends. We've discussed it. I offered to move to FL in a couple years (because right now would be financially foolish) and he doesn't want to leave his friends🤷🏻‍♀️ He HATES  the masks and the bs, but his Dad is here and he 100% has a choice and he chooses the bs for now.</p>

        <p>I witnessed the principal being disgusting towards a frantic parent who tried to run into the office to pick up her kindergarten child. The child was not in the usual spot. The principal admonished the parent, who was using her shirt to cover her mouth. Then banished her outside! It was such gross behavior. Didn’t even listen to what she had to say. If I were that parent I would have refused to leave until someone told me where my child was.</p>

        <p>Yup its the same with hospitals and doctors offices. I went in back in January for an ear infection to the doctors office. I said I had a sore throat as well but that my ear really hurt and had discharge which are not symptoms of covid besides the throat.</p>
<p>I had no major symptoms of covid like cough or shortness of breath. They said they can't treat covid patients and because I had a symptom I couldn't come in unless I got a negative test. </p>
<p>So after getting my test and coming back negative 4 days later I went in and got checked out. Inner ear infection because of fluid on the ear. Now I need a tube put in my ear which... I also can't get done because its not a emergency surgery.</p>
<p>So now I have inner ear pain all the time on constantly ibuprofen and can barely hear out of my right ear because doctors no longer follow their oath of "help anyone no matter what"</p>
<p>A bit off track but just highlighting that teachers aren't the only ones no longer doing what they signed up to do... take care of and teach any child.</p>

        <p>I recently watched a Corbett Report episode about just this- the doctors oath no longer being honored, or applicable, and that some doctors want to “revise” it accordingly. Just like they revised what ‘herd immunity’ means. Completely upside down.</p>

        <p>You're letting them restrict your child's breathing... your child can't see other kids' faces, emotions. Your child is being taught to be afraid of others, to see themselves as dirty and contagious. They're wearing some fabric that's continually leaving microfibers in their air intake, some in their lungs. Sure, it's not a steel cage, but your child is being hurt daily. They are going to have mental issues down the line from this.  You're also conditioning them to be a slave to the power in charge.</p>
<p>I'm being pretty strong here because I suffered abuse as a child, so even though I don't know you, I hope you fight your hardest for your kid. Maybe like you said, there's no other option, but you should try as much as you can.</p>

        <p>My child knows that what is going on is ridiculous. She knows that in know way can chose to not wear the mask and I have told her that if she is ever physically uncomfortable with her mask she can take it off where we are including school. She has been taught to continue life as normal, she hangs out with friends at the park and we go see family members.</p>
<p>However she needs education, so we make concessions. But she is being taught to know this world is fucked up right now and not how we will live forever. They wear masks in the halls and then take them off at there desks which is literally the dumbest thing ever cause I guess covid doesn't leave your body when you sit down.</p>
<p>But I won't raise her to think she will end up in a cage and to fear her teachers. She is taught to understand the world we live in, not fear it.</p>

        <p>Gotcha, I'm sorry to have flown off the handle so much. You're obviously doing the best you can, so I hope I didn't cause you too much anguish with my crass comments. I just live somewhere where kids are forced to mask outside while playing, and while seated at their desks. I see 4 year olds with two masks on, super tight, to the point where you can see them struggle to breathe when they play.</p>
<p>Again, apologies, it doesn't mean anything, but I went back and upvoted your comments. Hope this ends soon.</p>

        <p>Based.  Love it.  Still sad that she’s forced to wear one though.  Do all the schools in your area mandate them?  Because if this is really “the new normal”, it would be something to look into finding a place where she can go to school and actually see people smiling, breathe normally and learn normal social skills.</p>

        <p>I feel like you are barking at the wrong tree (like many others in here). It is not school principals or shop owners that force people to wear a mask, it is the government that forces school principals and shop owners to force people to wear a mask. They dont have a lot to say in this topic and when they resist, their shops will be shut down or they will lose their jobs. In some way those people are double fucked by covid: They have to suffer the same draconian rules like everyone else and on top of that are forced to enforce them what brings them hate from all sides. You are angry because he insists on your daughter wearing a mask and I bet some other mommy is angry because he let your daughter in without a mask (even if he gave her one later). No matter what he does, he is fucked</p>

        <p>Its not so much the mask requirement. Its the " your friends all have masks why don't you" comment. Like kids forget, but to make her feel like she is doing something wrong by not having one and is different from her peers because she isn't wearing one that really bugged me.</p>

        <p>Agreed. My district has been doing hybrid, so my kid has to carry EVERY book and a laptop to two different places. I called the principal and said my kid needs an exemption to use a rolling bag because he's going to hurt himself. She agreed. But when I drop him off there is always some a-hole teacher who comments on his rolling bag like it doesn't make sense. "Are you going on vacation?" That comment and the daily "have you gone over your covid questions?" drives me INSANE. I'm pretty loud about things that bother me, so it is extremely hard to keep my temper hidden and my mouth shut.</p>

        <p>Lets say you were a small business owner. And after months of being locked down, what you only survived by borrowing money, you finally are allowed to open up again - under the condition everyone inside your store has to wear a mask. Would you risk your families livelihood and everything you have built up your whole life just to make a statement? Would you take the food from your childrens plates and possible the roof above their heads as well just to show the government the finger for like two days until they shut you down forever? I know I would not, as my first responsibility in lifeis the wellbeing of my own family.</p>
<p>And while I will happily be standing right next to you when people across the world storm their capitals to take down the people imprisoning them, I cannot feel any anger to people like principle or small business owners (in general), as those people are fucked twice the amount than I am - and I really feel fucked after one year of practically seeing no human being</p>

        <p>Nah man, it drives me absolutely mad that people have the audacity to make descisions about my life like this. I am going insane and angry as hell just thinking about it. But projecting my anger on people that dont have a choice as well is the wrong direction. They are not the descisionmakers and they are not the reason my life practically ended one year ago. Being mad at them or insulting them does not help me even a little. Neither does it help you or anyone else. We all better channel our anger towards the politicians that lock us away and end our freedom</p>
