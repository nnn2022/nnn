    <strong>Time is of the essence; what can we do to take action?</strong>
    <p><p>Firstly, before we get banned or quarantined as a subreddit, we need to still continue to connect somewhere. </p>
<p>Possibly off social media. </p>
<p>We are going to need to take action. We will be needing to storm the streets of major cities across the country protesting our resistance. </p>
<p>We need to be as organized as them. No one is useless. There is always something you can do with your skill. </p>
<p>The US is slowly taking away our freedoms, this is what its been about the whole time. They’re already slowly taking away our guns and getting comfortable requiring us to comply with their ridiculous demands. Its about power and control, not the safety of the people and their not about to stop pushing. </p>
<p>Their strategy is to slowly push, hoping we just don’t notice, and when people resist they push back a bit, wait a while, then push harder the next time around. </p>
<p>They’re going back to masks now but eventually they will develop a vaccine that ‘does’ work. If you ask me, masks were never about stopping the spread, they were about submission just like the vaccine. The stay at home orders and putting everyone on unemployment were about destroying the economy. </p>
<p>If there is really anybody we should be pointing fingers at, its the ‘Elites,’ Biden, the CCP, and other corrupt governments around the world abusing their people, who have strategically created or encouraged this virus and spread it across the world in order to carry out their plan of getting the entire world to submit out of fear. The release of Corona virus, was no accident, anybody who actually believes it was bat soup is a fool. This was a genius, well thought out design to commit mass genocide and strike fear in people’s hearts. This was the start of a war. They were hoping to get away with killing people without blood on their hands. </p>
<p>If you think all the events that followed this virus around the world is a coincidence, its not. BLM before election year, Hong Kong’s riots, Cuba’s resistance to their government, South Africa’s looting, the Chinese Social Credit System and so on was no accident. The occurrence of these events, the division of the people during the pandemic, is no coincidence. </p>
<p>We will be resisting again and fighting back in the same position we are now when a new improved vaccine is developed. They will slowly make it mandatory for people to take the new and improved vaccine, they will assume there should be no excuses because it works. They will start by saying you can’t go to work, then school, then the the grocery store, its about segregation. Its not about whether the vaccine works or not, it never was. We need to be ready for this fight and we need to be organized and strong. </p>
<p>There are those with families that are struggling to decipher whether or not they should fight the vaccine mandates their workplaces are putting in place, it’ll be an even bigger push when the vaccines are improved. Lets fight for them and our country before it goes too far. If you can afford to leave your job if it come down to that (hopefully it doesn’t), help us fight.</p>
<p>If some of us don’t stand up now it’ll be a lot worse for the future. Its not like we want a war or that we all desire chaos, but I also don’t want to be living under a social credit system in a few years either because it will happen. We need to come together with other countries and fight this, the resistance is not just among Americans. We in this community are not crazy, we see it for what it is.</p>
<p>I reposted because of a grammar error in the title. There was a previous comment from a user regarding how we can connect called the white rose on the telegram.</p></p>

        <p>We do not win anything by tearing down the corrupt system of global governance.</p>
<p>We win by opting out and building a humane system without the parasitic governments attached to it. When we start a better civilization by welcoming all people ready to live on the foundation of real freedom again, we drain the parasites.</p>
<p>You should abandon your illusion that any major movement that is ultimately "pro-reform" and "pro-system" is going to be "pro-freedom". Left and right is the corridor set by the enemy.</p>
<p>The same enemy that has coopted every government and every opposition to government.</p>
<p>There is only one way out of this. Freedom. Direct action. Grassroot democracy.</p>
<p>Every central authority will eventually do what has happened now.</p>

        <p>It will be a fight to create our own territory with a humane system. Most area is already controlled and people are unwilling to just give it up. This may be the only way though.</p>

        <p>Problem is that would lead straight to civil war and do we really want to go 0-100 that quick? </p>
<p>I also don’t disagree with you though however because it seems our system/democracy has been abused by the dishonest.</p>
<p>I would like to be able take action but not jump straight into war either, though it might likely happen especially if they try to disarm our citizens. </p>
<p>Maybe we could increase the number of support groups and lobbyists in DC fighting for our rights and values such as the right to choose whether to be vaxed.</p>

        <p>Generally speaking, the side with the bigger stick will make the legislation.</p>
<p>It could work to go against the Banksters with enough funding and pressure.</p>
<p>However, this already is war. And they are not playing by any rules.</p>
<p>"Anarchy" sounds a lot worse than it actually is. The Paris Commune was anarchy.</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky kept talking about anarchy. Even Alex Jones is ultimately a proponent of anarchy.</p>
<p>It's not that we must oppose all sorts of power. Just the central power that is built on injustice and considers humans "hackable animals" at best and "virus vectors" at worst.</p>

        <p>I would even argue, both sides are somewhat corrupt in their own ways. Can we really trust the White House to carry out the legislation process honestly after how far things have gone? I don’t think so. </p>
<p>I would agree with you because the White House and corrupt governments world wide have already begun to throw out the rules, they’ve already waged war. </p>
<p>We need to construct and uphold a society that doesn’t abuse their power, and upholds the honest use of the checks and balances system. </p>
<p>Problem people buying into the new normal are more than happy to give away our freedoms to the wrong entity and they will be the reason we all have to fight.</p>

        <p>I haven’t tried making any subs on there but I’m sure we could and link up + make a new sub on dread (dark web Reddit ) as a start . I’m all for that anyway , as we are being ostracized and censored here . </p>
<p>Any and all planning of meet ups , moves we make , or when we will need to link up and fight this bull shit won’t be blasted on the clear net for all the fuck boys  to see . This can be our hub as a start , who knows when Reddit will full on black ball this sub for “propaganda” . Voicing our own opinions/thoughts  is not allowed these days by those that are too afraid to break away from echo chamber . </p>
<p>There are plenty of us who are thoughtful , question authority , and are still  sting human beings but the government doesn’t want us to organize and they are using the majority to try and quiet us . Im still enjoying my life as much as I can but I am generally angered by all that is going on . This plan was a long time coming , maybe I’m a conspiracy theorist but I could care less the only thing I care about is getting back to normal . Not pre COVID normal , that itself wasn’t normal , we’ve been being railroaded for a long time . I cant remember when normal was but I want a new normal for my children , myself , and all of us . This is much bigger then COVID , vaccines , masks and pandemics , it’s a gross abuse from governments against its people stemming from before most of us were even born .</p>
<p>I don’t know where to start with this but it’s obviously organizing somewhere safe .</p>
