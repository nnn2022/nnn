        <p>Yes, an objective reality exists, one in which you are completely blind to. </p>
<p>Imagine being so deluded by media, that you actually believe there is a pandemic caused by a mostly harmless virus, when in fact its a pandemic of governmental overreach.</p>

        <p>It’s actually a pandemic of a virus, but you’re close!</p>
<p>Wanna talk about the government? Great. It’s absolutely sick that the far-right in DC used the pandemic as an excuse to give massive corporations a slush fund. </p>
<p>This emotional hysteria is literally pushed by massively corporate-funded right-wing media.</p>

        <p>You’re sorta right on one thing- that left v right doesn’t materially exist. The only two sides are workers and capitalists, but that’s a different conversation.</p>
<p>Corporate right-wing Fox News, OAN and Newsmax (and the others, all massively funded) pushed this hysterical narrative since the pandemic began. </p>
<p>Corporate far-right senators pushed for a slush fund and liability shield for corporations instead of providing for you.</p>

        <p>You understand that there is an institution who's sole purpose is to extract as much of your labor from you as they can get away with in order to spend the capital on their own desires, much of which is to increase the amount of capital gained further by investing directly in markets that can do such...</p>
<p>I give you a hint.... It's a giant corporation, and you can't opt out of giving it business. It's shareholders control it's direction by vote, and they didn't have to do anything to earn that vote. The board is comprised of corporation shareholders who promise the world to those that elect them, and in turn are constantly re-elected. The corporation is just shy of being 28 trillion dollars in debt, and continues to borrow. Last year, it borrowed more money than it took in.</p>
<p>And you're deluded to think it has your best interest at heart.</p>

        <p>If you’re seriously making an anti-taxation argument I’d inform you that there exists no large organization of humans in history that did not involve taxation. </p>
<p>And if you’re mad about what the government spends on- great! I’m with you. The whole reason they spend money on “their desires” is because they don’t represent working Americans. They represent corporations and the wealthy. </p>
<p>The government is broken because it’s bought.</p>

        <p>I’d love to respond to those points, but I actually didn’t simply say “but it’s a pandemic,” I said this hysteria was pushed by corporate right-wing media. I also said that the government sold the store to corporations instead of properly providing for people. Wanna respond to either of those points, or do you just need to be the victim here?</p>

        <p>In the beginning, I do remember the people on the right yelling at the people on the left for the same reasons it's flipped now, and I completely called out my side for that. It switched, pretty quick, though. Now most of the hysteria is from the left. The vast majority.</p>

<p>Are there a lot of things it shouldn’t provide? Sure. But economic security in a pandemic? Healthcare? Clean water? Yes.</p>
<p>Nobody’s arguing for luxuries. </p>
<p>When survival checks went out and unemployment gave you an extra 600, consumer spending went UP. This is demand-side economics and we did it all throughout America’s economic golden age.</p>

        <p>Do you have any specific examples of how they pushed hysteria? </p>
<p>Likewise, do you have any examples of more mainstream media like NBC, CBS, ABC, etc providing a more restrained, balanced picture of the pandemic?</p>
<p>I’m just trying to connect the dots here to understand — you might be on to something here. </p>
<p>I’m just having a tough time working out how outlets like OAN or Newsmax can control the public narrative of virus hysteria on a grand scale without having anywhere near the reach or impact of NBC. Can you help me tie this together?</p>

        <p>Conservatives almost exclusively, by the numbers, watch Fox, OAN, newsmax, etc. there’s very little overlap. Those who watch those sources (btw Fox has more reach than any of those outlets) receive this hysterical narrative. </p>
<p>Put another way, if you watch Newsmax, you’re not watching NBC to check up on the facts, right? </p>
<p>And don’t worry, NBC, CBS and ABC push their own narrative and it’s disgusting, but it’s in service of corporations/famous democratic politicians.</p>

        <p>That’s not what I’m asking — because people on the left are just as scared (if not more) of the virus as are people on the right. </p>
<p>Did the reporting on Fox News early on make you personally afraid of the virus? </p>
<p>I’m asking about the discrepancies between the reach and impact of the two sides. If there’s anything that conservatives can’t control its public narrative, simply because the big corporate media skews more to the left. </p>
<p>On a somewhat related note, Joe Biden received far, far more financial support from Wall Street than Trump. By that metric, it appears that the big corporations believe they benefit more by having left-leaning politicians in charge.</p>

        <p>Corporations own both parties and there is no significant “left” presence in either the government or corporate media. Technically in favor of performative wokeisms? Sure. But thats not left, that’s performative. </p>
<p>Corporate right-wing outlets pushed a hysterical narrative about the pandemic (about a whole lot of other issues too) and their viewership largely believes it. This is actually knowable- viewers of CNN and the like are more likely to rely on multiple sources (of course, all of them bad), but viewers of Fox, OAN or Newsmax are more likely to stick to their favorite. It’s a propaganda pipeline.</p>
<p>It’s not about control over the public narrative; there IS no public narrative. It’s more accurate to say we have several competing metanarratives. It’s not that right wing corporate channels control the public narrative; it’s that they control THEIR narrative, and a lot of people listen to it without any challenge. </p>
<p>Same reason Democrats were so obsessed with Russiagate. All of the channels they listen to told them it was a big deal, so it became a big deal.</p>

        <p>I think you and I agree on more than you would expect. </p>
<p>However — and respectfully — I do believe you are vastly underestimating and ignoring the influence of the left across all cultural institutions, especially in the news media. </p>
<p>I also think there’s a huge hole in your argument as far as who is responsible for “pushing hysteria” is concerned. Looking back, which states were less likely to enact severe lockdown policies? Which states are currently more likely to ease any restrictions that were put in place? </p>
<p>Red states. Florida has been the epicenter of controversy for months — basically putting conservatives who for the most part are resisting government lockdowns and mask enforcement vs liberals who are strongly in favor of more government restrictions and punishments for defiance of masking policies. </p>
<p>If what you are saying is true, then OAN, Newsmax, and Breitbart did a really bad job at convincing their viewers that this virus was something to be terrified of. </p>
<p>Also, you claim that consumers of right-leaning media tend to not watch or read other sources. All I can say is that it is awfully hard to avoid mainstream media in today’s world. One has to actively search out alternative, right-leaning sources but only has to turn on the TV for a football game or visit yahoo! to be immediately presented with a left-leaning perspective on 
current events.</p>
<p>All I’m saying is to reconsider that bias of imagining right-leaning individuals as some mindless, sheep-like mass of zombies.</p>

        <p>It’s a problem that your partner is losing her job or that your kids can’t hang out with their peers. That’s partly just the nature of going through a pandemic, but MOSTLY because our government failed to provide for people and properly lock down. We needed to do both. That’s why it’s bad, not because liberals want to control you.</p>

        <p>Yes, I'm whining that the government is allowing your partner to lose their job. I'm whining that the government gave corporations a slush fund and they gave you $1200 for 9 months.</p>
<p>I'm whining that the government has no problem sending our kids to war, and every problem with giving parents parental leave to raise their kids.</p>
<p>I'm whining that the government is run and owned by the wealthy and corporate elite. And that that same government cut every possible social program it could while condensing the majority of our country's wealth, which WE create, in the hands of the rich, while people are evicted from their homes.</p>
<p>I'm whining that so many elderly people have to live in poverty, or have to work at *all*.</p>

Someone literally said a few years ago that they identify as a "genderless alien." I know their "argument." It's "I must be whatever I think I am despite my physical biology!"</p>

        <p>So you found a weirdo that identified as an alien. There are 330 million people in this country, yes, there are weird people. </p>
<p>Nobody is identifying as a toaster, or attack helicopter, or Asian or whatever. Those are obviously ridiculous. </p>
<p>“Their” argument is simple. Sex is bimodal, yes. “Gender” refers to the behaviors, lifestyle, experience, etc we’ve constructed <em>around</em> sex. Can you change your physical sex, your very chromosomes? No. Nobody’s arguing that. </p>
<p>Gender is a social construct. That doesn’t mean it’s FAKE, it just means that the conception of what “gender” is isn’t innately biological, but a construction of people. Language, for example, is a social construct. </p>
<p>That’s the actual argument as I can put it, but I’m not trans so I wouldn’t know everything about this. Just so you can see, “genderless alien” is an exception, not the rule. Most trans people are perfectly normal and just want to live their lives.</p>

        <p>&rt;act like an American </p>
<p>You mean the Americans who currently and historically have always placed a high value upon personal rights, freedoms, and liberties? The personal rights, freedoms, and liberties that are being infringed upon with all the mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns?</p>
<p>&rt;please, care a LITTLE about your community.</p>
<p>I do, that's the best part. I care about the tanked economy, along with the massive spikes in unemployment, home loss, poverty, starvation, missed health checks, obesity, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, anxiety, depression, suicide, and a myriad of other terrible things. Things that are a direct result of the mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns.</p>
<p>&rt;The death count is real. The case count is real.</p>
<p>Ehhhhh, they're fairly exaggerated though, considering all of the false-positives and what counts as a "Covid death".</p>
<p>Speaking of deaths, the stupidly high survival rate is very real as well.</p>
<p>&rt;Facts don’t care about your feelings, and they CERTAINLY don’t care about your hysteria.</p>
<p>You mean facts like: Stay home if you're so terrified and paranoid of this virus. If you are, and you're taking all the personal precautions in order to make you feel safe, then you have very little reason to be worried about that all those terrible, selfish grandma killers?</p>
<p>Do you mean hysteria as in all of the hysteria that media and social media create over this virus every single day?</p>

        <p>I’ll clear it up: a “covid death” is a death that would not otherwise occur had that person not caught covid. A massive percent of us in the US have pre-existing conditions. If covid kills someone with one, they still died from covid. </p>
<p>And by “Act like an American,” I mean act like Americans did in WWII. When we banded together and worked as one for our country.</p>
<p>Care about the economy? Great. I care a LOT about the economy. When survival checks went out, and unemployment gave you an extra 600, consumption went UP. If the government actually provided for Americans THROUGHOUT this pandemic, none of what you mentioned would happen. </p>
<p>It’s not lockdown vs no-lockdown. If we did it right and PROVIDED for people we would be in this mess. </p>

        <p>&rt;a death that would not otherwise occur had that person not caught covid.</p>
<p>So pretty much just 80+ year olds who had underlying conditions, or those younger who had more severe underlying conditions. But that's not how the death toll is being counted, though.</p>
<p>&rt;When we banded together and worked as one for our country.</p>
<p>If we want to work together as one of our country, then I think that we need to put an emphasis on those essential personal rights, liberties, and freedoms - such as we had during that era. Open up again, protect the vulnerable, let people take whatever personal precautions necessary in order to make them feel safe and let others do the same. Live your life, I'll live mine. Win-win.</p>
<p>&rt;If the government actually provided for Americans THROUGHOUT this pandemic, none of what you mentioned would happen. </p>
<p>You know the best way for the government to provide for you and look out for you? To allow you to work and live your life as you see personally fit. None of what I mentioned would have happened if government hadn't decided to shut the world down.</p>
<p>If you're upset at the government for not cutting you larger and more frequent checks, I'd advise you to direct some of that frustration at all the countries who do next to nothing for their citizens.</p>
<p>&rt;If we did it right and PROVIDED for people we wouldnt be in this mess. </p>
<p>Meaning what, exactly?</p>

<p>If we properly locked down and the government actually provided for people to stay home, we would be largely out of this mess. </p>
<p>Instead, they threw us scraps. Right-wing corporate media pushed a narrative that the real threat wasn’t the pandemic, but the liberal agenda.</p>
<p>Blame the right people. We’re in this because the government sold the store to the corporate elite, not because liberals want to control you.</p>
