<p>Favorite comment: </p>
<p>I was vaccinated in pregnancy, and received a lot of criticism from vaccine skeptics in my life for doing so because it’s only recently (like last few days) been made available to preggos in my country. So I fought for it before it was advisable. And my response to any skeptic who criticized me for my choice was, “I and countless other pregnant women have had to make a very difficult decision with a new vaccinate, because you refuse to protect us by vaccinating yourself.”</p>
<p>Shuts them up quickly.</p>
<p>Pregnant women are really stuck between a rock and a hard place this pandemic.</p>
<p>^ this idiot. It’s so annoying and frustrating how pregnant women think that complete strangers owe them anything. I get so embarrassed when people offer to do things for me. I definitely don’t think I deserve special treatment or consideration just because I let my boyfriend bust in me. </p>
<p>At this point, I don’t even care if I get banned from that sub. All it is is women posting about the vaccine or their birth stories (as if anyone but their families and friends truly care). Sigh.</p></p>

        <p>Did they hear about the 5 month old breastfed baby that died of blood clots (the same kind the vaccine is causing) shortly after his mother got the vaccine??? It’s crazy because many of these women won’t smoke weed, eat fish or lunch meat or a drink a glass of wine while pregnant because “it’s not safe” but they are totally willing to get a non-FDA approved vaccine that was never tested on pregnant women!</p>

        <p>This is actually crazy propaganda. Notice how an American news company is saying India and Brazil bc they’re thing to scare Americans to get it. If they say “new strains are killing babies” in foreign countries who are American people to question it we don’t know what’s going on across the world. Create a fake wave after wave. What’s the point now though? Anybody that has not gotten it yet likely isn’t going to by fearmongering. Only by force now—like vaccination passports and such</p>

        <p>Yeah I absolutely refused any and all vaccines during pregnancy and those were ones that are common. I sure as absolute fuck would not be getting a new, experimental one during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Thalidomide babies, anyone ??</p>
<p>It's your job, as a pregnant woman, to protect your baby... Not to "protect others/me" because I don't have the vaccine. If it really is that bothersome to you then <em>you</em> stay home and stop subjecting your unborn fetus that hasn't even taken it's first breath to experiential medicine neither of you need as a life saving intervention.</p>
