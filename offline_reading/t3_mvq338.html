    <strong>I WILL NO LONGER CALL PEOPLE SHEEP!</strong>
    <p><p>At this point, in this age of internet ignorance is a choice.
To participate, defend and parrot the propaganda, allowing the creation of this medical apartheid totalitarianism makes you guilty of what is (and i hope we can still prevent this) about to happen.
The people who go and take the "vaccine" so they can travel again, go to a bar or out to dinner and get a test so they can prove they are "uninfectious" are allowing this to happen.
That is a reversal of proof of guilt!
You are innocent untill proven guilty and the burden of proof does not lie on the part of the suspect, and even more so, WE ARE NOT SUSPECTS!!!
The people are not livestock!
The people who do this will be judged by future generations the same way the people born in germany after ww2 still feel the shame for what their ancestors did and allowed to happen, history will judge them harshly.</p>
<p>Rights, freedom and liberty come with responsibility, the first of which is to preserve them for yourself and future generations by enacting them and never giving them up no matter the consequence.
It is your duty to resist and refuse to comply!</p>
<p>I understand this is a divide and conquer strategy which i do not abide to, but facts are facts.</p>
<p>I have decided to no longer call them "sheep" like the sheep in animal farm by george orwell, for the sheep truly didn't know better.</p>
<p>I shall call them chickens, after lenin's chicken.
Having their feathers plucked alive and still following and running after every crumb the government gives them.</p>
<p>If a thief steals €10 from you and than gives you €2 back, do you thank him or angrily ask "where is the rest"!?
You have still been and are being robbed, you fuckin chickens!</p>
