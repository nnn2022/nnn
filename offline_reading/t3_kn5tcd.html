    <strong>Lockdowns may be needed?</strong>
    <p><p>Is anyone starting to lean over to the doomer side of things and wondering if it's real and we need harsh lockdowns? I think I'm starting to think this way. In my province Ontario, we report nearly 3,000 new cases. I'm seriously thinking I'm slowly turning into a half-doomer. I think we need the lockdown, but at the same time, I feel something fishy is going on.</p></p>

        <p>3,000 cases in a province with over 14 million people? that's .02% </p>
<p>why would you advocate for a lockdown that affects .02% of the population, and in turn hurt people's businesses and livelihoods?</p>

        <p>Add in the 30-50% false positives and that drops to around 1500 cases. How many of those cases are actually sick, let alone at risk?</p>

        <p>I don’t think most people are denying that it’s real...</p>
<p>You said 3,000 cases... not deaths. A virus is supposed to infect, there is no stopping that. The number of cases is not a surprise or something to be concerned about.</p>

        <p>Take a deep breath and remember that the use of "cases" as a counting mechanism is both disingenuous and designed to unstill fear. </p>
<p>In past generations, a "case" was clearly defined as a person having severe enough symptoms necessitating the seeking of medical advice, or a sick person who visits a doctor, and then tests positive for a contagion.</p>
<p>Today, asymptomatic persons (aka - healthy people with strong immune systems) are being tested and counted as cases. This means that there is exactly no way to compare what's being counted in this "pandemic" to pandemics of history. The definition of a case, simply put, is not the same.</p>
<p>Both economists and doctors will tell you that lockdowns are not the way to handle the situation. The negative outcomes of lockdowns outweigh the benefits and create negative externalities that ripple out over time. Check the prior posts on the harms of lockdowns and understand that while COVID could potentially kill a lot of people, in most cases, the folks who die have depleted immune systems for one reason or another, which can often be rectified with proper nutrition and some exercise. Lockdowns are a form of medical tyranny and are unsettlingly unscientific.</p>

        <p>Shielding the vulnerable? Sure. That's a normal medical response during an epidemic.</p>
<p>Total lockdowns of people who face next-to-no clinical risk? No. That's unprecedented madness that might save hundreds - like the 388 healthy under-60s who have died with COVID-19 in the UK - but, according to various global aid organisations including the World Bank and World Food Programme, kills tens of millions.</p>

        <p>3000 "cases" based on a pcr test that at 35 cycles produces 97% false positives.</p>
<p>3000 "cases" of a disease with (according to Dr battacharya) a 99.95% survival rate if you're under 70.</p>
<p>This is a nonissue, this isn't even the flu at this stage. Even considering there are a few in icu care with active covid present and may die from that on top of their other conditions, the lockdowns we're implementing aren't stopping the spread of the disease, aren't saving these people. By last February (again according to Dr battacharya from an interview in November) it was too late to lock down and stop the disease.</p>
