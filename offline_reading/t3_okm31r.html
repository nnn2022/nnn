    <strong>Need info on why we are in the end times</strong>
    <p><p>I’m making a Christian club at my college and I’m going to try to wake people up who are blind about what is going on. I’d rather not look like an idiot and need to gather up a lot of info so any y’all have would help a ton!</p></p>

        <p>If you look at any population with exponential growth, statistically you end up with most of that population alive at the very end, alive to witness their collapse. So even if it takes a thousand years, most people alive were not born in the first 900 years, the majority to ever be born are born in the last 100 years.</p>
<p>The point I am trying to make is that it is likely we are going to witness our collapse, even if this isn't it. Even though at first it seems unlikely and self centered to think that we are the unique generation to witness it, statistically we are the most likely.</p>

        <p>A good sentiment. Martyrs are a big part of the real Christian tradition.</p>
<p>And even before that did the Athenians kill Socrates for speaking the truth.</p>

        <p>We have all been complicit in what is unfolding today to some extent, if only by being complacent. The prophets always urge society to abandon its false ways.</p>
<p>Early Christianity was about social reform. It was about fighting for a humane way of life. We are the children of an age that has taken dehumanization so far that people are literally becoming gene modified organisms through mRNA injections right now.</p>
<p>Got to draw the line somewhere. I never really cared for "spirituality" too much. I dabbled but now I had to embrace it simply because we are all forced to pick a side now. Being on the side of humanity is where we need to be and you are here.</p>

        <p>I agree nowadays evil has never been more clear and it’s sad. Manipulation is evident and you would have to be blind to not see there is an evil agenda and an evil force/entity pulling the strings. I was very fortunate to be saved a few months back. I prayed that I would give my life to God and spread the true gospel if He gave me visions that were undeniable and that could only explained through God, since then I’ve had several and a lot of dreams too.</p>

        <p>I think there really is something to that. I had an epiphany of sorts. A feeling, rather than a thought. As a thought, though, I would say... Logically, the mind understands that there are things in this universe that our logic cannot explain.</p>

        <p>There’s many things that people try to reason through as a “coincidence” but they have “eyes that don’t see, and ears that don’t hear.” I tried to reason through at first despite feeling the Holy Spirit come through my entire body after repeating a born again Christian prayer then crying out of nowhere, then seeing a white orb moments later. I had to have several more experiences until my faith was solidified. Because God tries to reach out to humans it would make sense for the purpose of life to be for humans to find God- so those who know the truth must try to guide others that are blind. Right now it is important more than ever.</p>

        <p>SS: Currently we are living in a “pandemic” and the number of deaths are greatly exaggerated. If you die a long time after getting covid it is counted as a covid death (despite there being almost no evidence), if you die almost immediately after the vaccine then it is RARELY(maybe 1-10% of the time) counted as a vaccine related death. This is to pump the number of “covid deaths” and minimize the vaccine deaths. This makes people think the virus is far deadlier than it actually is and that the vaccine is safe. Inside the vaccines there are spike proteins that attack the immune system- this is proven but hardly spoken about in mainstream media. There are also ZERO long term studies of the “vaccines”. People that have spoken about adverse reactions to the virus- or anything bad whatsoever are censored and what they say online is taken down. There are also saline shots that are unknowingly being given. These shots are likely being given to the people that heavily promote the “vaccines”. People that question the “vaccines” and don’t take them are demonized by mainstream media and there is clearly a division happening in America. Now there are orders being given to go door to door to get people to take vaccines.</p>
