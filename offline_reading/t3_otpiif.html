    <strong>Public 'Health' Surveillance Systems</strong>
    <p><p>As many of you have witnessed across the world, surveillance systems are strengthening to 'tackle' the sarscov2 virus. Here is an outline that WHO issued on 'guidance' to strengthen these systems: <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/337897/WHO-2019-nCoV-SurveillanceGuidance-2020.8-eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/337897/WHO-2019-nCoV-SurveillanceGuidance-2020.8-eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y</a></p>
<p>If you look into the big tech companies, it's clear to see that privacy and surveillance has always been a major issue. Most people don't trust big tech, but they continue to use their products as the fine print is almost never read or talked about in detail. A general attitude of "I have nothing to hide" is what a lot of people hold. Yet, enough behavioural data on a population can lead to behavioural control and desired outcomes. Ironically, big tech KNOW that humans are social creatures and getting everyone online is one example of this behavioural manipulation. Fear of missing out is a stronger driving force than sitting down and reading the fine print for what kind of privacy violations big tech are placing on you.</p>
<p>Big tech have limitations in what they can do due to being in a democratic society. Many laws have been put in place for decades that protect people's privacy. Since covid, there has been a trickle down effect, initially from WHO, to strengthen public health surveillance systems. Governments and much of the science community have all agreed that something needs to be put into place to track covid, especially if there are more 'pandemics' in the future. Most people are quite fearful, that they will agree to anything in order to protect themselves and those they care about from the threat of covid.</p>
<p>We have already seen this type of surveillance with contact tracing. Though this has been put into place as an emergency use and isn't actually part of federal law. Conveniently, big tech already had this technology and systems prior to covid.</p>
<p>TLDR &amp; Conclusion: Asymptomatic viruses are the new public 'health' THREAT. In order to CONTROL them, surveillance systems need to be put into place to track EVERYONE across the globe, and ISOLATE the transmission of these invisible ENEMIES (viruses).</p>
<p>When you think about it. A lot of how public health operates is very much reminiscent of computing systems, not nature.</p></p>
