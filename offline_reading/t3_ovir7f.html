    <strong>Billionaire wealth has surged tremendously during the pandemic. But how did it happen? And why does literally no one care about this?</strong>
    <p><p>I was just coming across <a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/">this article</a> earlier and was shocked at just how big of an opportunity this pandemic has been to hoard wealth among the world's richest. I knew there had been an increase, but I had no idea it was this huge. But I didn't come across a single article explaining how exactly that happened. Can anyone shed some light on this?</p></p>

        <p>It's no surprise that Bezos/Amazon is #1 on the list. </p>
<p>During lockdown, some places banned the purchase of "non-essential" items, so people were forced to go online to buy anything deemed unimportant.</p>
<p>(And who the hell decides what's important? Bookstores are essential for students, art supply and office stores are essential for small business owners, and so on.)</p>
<p>The belief, "It's cheaper on Amazon!" has been killing retail for years already. The lockdowns only sped up the decline. Now millions of people have developed agoraphobia and they're getting all their shopping delivered because they think they'll die if they go outside.</p>

        <p>Well, shut down small businesses, force people to stay at home, retail therapy with big chains like Amazon, target, Walmart is the only option, billionaires make more money and their competition doesn’t come back after.  </p>
<p>Note: billionaires own social media companies too, and they’ve made bank as well.  Make sure you don’t go against their narrative, or you won’t have the crutch of social media during the next lockdowns. </p>
<p>It’s almost like it was part of the plan.</p>

        <p>Mandates were a strike against financial independence.  Small business and landlords were targeted while conglomerates were integrated as arms of the government with free rein of the marketplace.</p>

        <p>Sorry but saying obvious things to explain why Bezos or those associates with big pharma made tens of billions would get me labeled a conspiracy nut.</p>
