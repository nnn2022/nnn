    <strong>I love you all and I want to criticize you</strong>
    <p><p>I know you're frustrated, exhausted, exasperated, etc. I understand venting these feelings.</p>
<p>Sometimes some of you are far too harsh in your criticisms of other people who aren't in our camp. I'm not talking about the Nazi types who would gas us. I'm talking about your everyday Joe.</p>
<p>These people don't deserve scorn for being wrong. I consider myself lucky to have the experiences and knowledge that have allowed me to better understand reality. I view people who lack these as unfortunate and I treat them that way.</p>
<p>I know it's not easy to do, but you know the best path is to fill your heart with love and reject hatred and resentment. Love your enemies, and forgive them for they know not what they do. They will never change their minds because someone dunked on them and called them an idiot. They might change their minds if they come to understand you care for their welfare.</p></p>

        <p>I think that deep down in their subconscious, most of them know it's a lie - a giant con job. The problem is that they're too weak or cowardly to admit it, even to themselves.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I remember the moments before I decided to take the deep dive into vaccination. I was so uncomfortable, it felt wrong to do. Like it was bad. Then I thought...wtf. why in god's green earth should I feel bad about an idea? About a question? About researching? The propaganda contains content, but it's delivery is important. It is telling you not to think for yourself, that certain thoughts are bad, etc.</p>

        <p>Yes exactly. The propaganda almost always plays on emotion while pushing logic and facts to a secondary role. If they do present facts and logic, they're usually twisted and inverted.</p>

<p>They are janissaries. They've been brainwashed from birth, and they're aware of it. And they're ashamed of not having the strength to resist. This turns into hatred for anyone who does have the strength to resist.</p>

        <p>Loving and understanding doesn't mean being soft and ceding your position. It's about attitude and approach. If you put yourself in someone else's shoes and see things from their perspective, you can begin to see how to peel back the layers of propaganda. But more importantly, it's just a better way of existing than letting resentment control you.</p>

        <p>Hey, earlier when you suggested that maybe our view on the word "love" may just be different, I think you had a point.</p>
<p>I don't want to make a big deal out of it. And I hate getting caught in semantics because if we were having this conversation in a different language then it might not even be an issue. So I appreciate that you at least have a positive attitude.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you. I wish more people had an attitude like yours.</p>

        <p>You seem to see anything other than going on the offensive at all times as weakness and prone to failure. Unfortunately your method guarantees conflict and destruction. No one wins in that scenario. We all lose.</p>

<p>I also do not believe in the offensive. I'm warning that people need to get ready to get <em>defensive.</em></p>
<p>I do hope we can do things your way, but I do not believe we'll have that chance. I think we're past the point of no return.</p>

        <p>&rt; But I don't believe we are "being divided." We are divided. The lines are drawn.</p>
<p>That is exactly what they want you to believe. That's how divide and conquer works. They get you to believe you're on a side whether you like it or not, and the people who aren't on your side are therefore the enemy.</p>
<p>It's a natural biological response to your threat perception, and it's being used against you and the "other side" as well. They're being conditioned to see us as a threat the exact same way.</p>
<p>The difference is they feel empowered because the power structures encourage them. They're being manipulated just the same, but using ego in addition to fear.</p>
<p>The only solution is to break their conditioning by violating their expectations. They expect a hate-filled moron. Give them the opposite.</p>

<p>Just use your intuition. If they were operating from strength, they wouldn't be trying to hurry things along and drop the slow boil strategy. They wouldn't be trying to convince us it was hopeless. They would want to continue to lull us into complacency. </p>
<p>Their strategy of jarring you into conflict is to justify a brutal crackdown. Any action will be used against us. Hold the line.</p>

        <p>Being wrong may not deserve scorn, but thinking it's justified to take people's freedom certainly does. If one day they realize that they're wrong and are willing to admit that, great. But (and I know this is probably the unpopular opinion) opening your heart and filling it with love and compassion and wearing your heart on your sleeve just ain't gonna cut it when we're fighting every single day to push back against a total dystopia. I know this may be hard to hear for some people, but this isn't some story with a happy ending where love saves the day because love saves the day. This is real life and in real life, love doesn't always triumph.</p>

        <p>I agree. I wrestle with this because I'm trying to develop a spiritual practice and it would SEEM that love, light forgiveness would be the goals and that I would just "open my heart" as much as possible to all. However, I believe we are at war. Different rules apply...so I'll give love and light to MYSELF so that I'm in decent shape to pursue, speak out, and act upon the truth--in other words, to fight.</p>

        <p>The problem here is you are a reasonable person. Most people when they have made up their minds they will not budge. Look at most politicians (representatives of the people) right now they find themselves in so much bullshit. Because they can't just say oh Corona was actually less dangerous then we thought the restrictions will be lifted (without the magical vac). No you need to give these people an out... Like a vaccine. That way they can be wrong without feeling like they were.</p>

        <p>Good post.  I think a lot of it is that we are constantly the target of toxic aggression by the haters.  If somebody fucks with you, you can't just take it.</p>
<p>Since we are constantly in the aggressively defensive posture it's easy to lash out on anyone who seems to represent those who seek our destruction.</p>

        <p>I entirely agree. As frustrating as it can be, there's no reason to be outright insulting to people who just don't know any better right now. People who either don't have the time to delve into research, or are listening to those they trust - be it their friends, family, government, or whomever. It's sad perhaps, but it doesnt warrant name-calling and the like.</p>
<p>All of us are doing what we can to end this dumb situation, in whatever ways we know how, based on the information we've come to know and trust. It's just that we've come to know and trust different information.</p>
