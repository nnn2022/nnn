        <p>It’s not the flu and yes I know you all will downvote me to hell by multiple people in my family have got it and 2 died. The other 2 have long lasting effects this virus is not a joke and I have seen it first hand. Do you think they wanted to destroy peoples business and livelihood when they first started the stimulus checks they were trying to give money to the businesses. Please don’t harm other people with your unreasonable idea of being smart. If killing other people and being okay with other people dying then there’s something wrong with you</p>

        <p>Yes, that's exactly what they wanted to have happen. They don't care about us. They gave an agenda to push and if people die, oh well. </p>
<p>So, you're ok with people dying from suicide, starvation, becoming homeless, child abuse/spousal on the rise, and long term mental health issues?</p>
<p>Edit - I know probably 40 people who have had it and are completely fine. I'm sorry you have family members that died. Unfortunately that's what happens. People die from many many other things as well. You will die when it's your time to die.</p>

        <p>There’s a difference between people dying and people having their lives fucking cut short for no damn reason. I care about shit like suicide and homelessness. But why haven’t we don’t this years ago if it’s that important? Why do you care to do something now that all these people have had their family members die and see their families torn apart. This year there have been 1.67 million deaths just from corona. Suicide is estimated to take 800,000 worldwide a year. But now people are becoming “free thinkers” by watching others die and are only now really fighting suicide.</p>

        <p>What if that's just the way they were gonna die? What about car accidents? That's cut short for no reason. Getting cancer? Being murdered? Killing yourself because your life has been torn apart by the lockdowns? </p>
<p>People need to get healthier so they can fight the virus. We can't do this forever. The vaccine isn't even very effective. Masks are that effective. People need to get healthier, period.</p>

        <p>What do you mean the vaccines isn’t effective lmao? Have you seen how it works. Also yes make are effective but they work better when everyone wears one and can stay 6 feet apart. It’s simple. It’s only been a year and once we start making more vaccines and everyone has one it’ll be way easier to eradicate the virus like we did with polio</p>

        <p>I said it isn't even very effective, maybe actually read the comment before you rage on. It's maybe 95% effective and they have no idea if you'll still be able to spread the virus. You'll need to still wear a mask afterwards. So what's the point?</p>
<p>Polio was spread through unclean water and bad pipes.....covid isn't like polio....polio is one strand. Covid has already changed this year.</p>

        <p>Okay so I worded that bad. I almost died to suicide. I care about it and have tried my best to help my community’s and those around me. I care about worlds problems but it feels like the same people that are acting like their loosing their rights by wearing a damn mask are the same people that a year ago looked the other direction when seeing suicide statistics. I’m sorry you think I’m a monster but we need to prioritize fixing what corona has don’t to our community’s and economy’s and things like suicide at the same time. Also what self interest do I have? Ever since I tried committing suicide I haven’t really don’t a lot for myself.</p>

        <p>If we did that we would have way more than 315,000 deaths. People wearing mask and social distancing stopped so many from death. Look at Italy. They did it and their doing better than America. SMH sometimes I wish I could just move to Canada. America has gone to shut these last 4 years</p>

        <p>You are getting downvoted because:
A) people lie about family dying over covid on social media all the time. I was quite surprised to meet a covid dead aunt of a friend at the supermarket. If something did happen to your family then I'm sorry the virus killed your family members. You must be really really unlucky or have some very fat/old family but that sounds sad.</p>
<p>B)   I have no idea what point you are trying to make with the stimulus checks. Yes doomers are prioritising Thier fear of a pretty harmless virus alll things considered and stealing millions of people's livelihood a directly for no real compensation.</p>
<p>C) ideas don't really harm people and if they do then they need to get out there to be debated down, you sound a bit fascististic to me.</p>
<p>D)  no one is killing anyone by spreading the airborne virus, the virus is killing people. </p>
<p>If you want to seriously argue the lockdown measures work then you need to provide evidence of that. If you are okay with other people's kids dying do to lockdowns then there is something wrong with you.</p>

        <p>How old were they and what other conditions did they have?  I've known several people including myself who got it and we're all in our 40s and fine.  We all recovered with no lasting effects.</p>
<p>If every single person age 20-49 in America got it, a maximum of 27,000 people would die.  That's what 0.002% looks like.  The flu has VERY similar mortality rates.</p>

        <p>Don't bother. These people don't care. They'd rather risk their kids ending up with MIS than wear a mask for 20 minutes while they pick up bread and milk. </p>
<p>What's funny is the original post "who's going to flatten these curves". I don't even know why they're asking because they show every day just how much they don't care. And many of them believe that people in these situations can get themselves out if they just work hard enough. </p>
<p>Sorry about your family. It is truly awful what people experience with this disease and what many will continue to experience for a long time after. Keep yourself safe and have a good holiday.</p>

        <p>Probably because English isn't their first language though, so maybe give them a little grace? I know I couldn't do much better arguing about another nation's politics in a second language.</p>

        <p>You need to REALLY look at what happened.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>He sent ventilators, supplies, medical ships, and thousands of hospital beds in an emergency shelter and New York ignored all of that and didn't use ANY of it- Why?  Because the governor of New York hates Trump and would rather people DIE than accept help from him.  And the democratic politicians here praised him for letting all those people die because they hate Trump too...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is what REALLY happened</p>
<p>NYT January 8th: "There is no evidence that the virus is readily spread by humans"</p>
<p>WHO January 14: On Twitter "Peliminary investigations have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China</p>
<p>January 21: We get the very first reported coronavirus patient reported in the US: CDC</p>
<p>January 22: Dr. Fauci told Newsmax's Greg Kelly, "This is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is notsomething that the citizens of the United States should be worried about right now."</p>
<p>January 26: Dr. Fauci again, this time in an interview with John Catsimatidis. "It's a very, very low risk to the United States"</p>
<p>January 28: BuzzFeed News, "Don't worry about the Coronavirus.  Worry about the Flu."</p>
<p>January 31: Vox News on Twitter "Is this going to be a deadly pandemic?  No."</p>
<p>January 31: The Washington Post, "How our brains make Coronavirus seem scarier than it is"</p>
<p>Janurary 31: Trump, in direct defiance to the liberal media, liberal politicians, and WHO, begins blocking travel to and from China.</p>
<p>He gets called xenophobic and paranoid by several people in the democratic party.  This can be looked up on Google very easily.</p>
<p>January 31: CNN "As the Coronavirus spreads, fear is fueling racism and xenophobia"</p>
<p>February 2nd: NYC Health Commissioner "...the risk to New Yorkers for Coronavirus is low and our city preparedneess is high. There is no reason not to take the subway, not to take the bus..."</p>
<p>February 3: The Washington Post, "Why we should be wary of an aggressive government response to Coronavirus"</p>
<p>February 5: The New York Times, "Who says it's not safe to travel to China?  The Coronavirus travel ban is unjust and doesn't work anyway."</p>
<p>On February 24, Pelosi told people that Chinatown was safe and that she hoped people would come to hang out.  She and everyone else was there without masks and told people to come join her.</p>
<p>February 26:  New york Times "Let's call it Trumpvirus. If you're feeling awful, you kno who to blame."</p>
<p>March 2: Bill de Blasio on Twitter, "Since I'm encouraging New Yorkers to go on with your lives + get out on the town despite Coronavirus, I thought I would offer some suggestions.  Here's the first: thru Thurs 3/5 go see "The Traitor" u/FilmLinc. If "The Wire" was a true story + set in Italy, it would be this film.</p>
<p>March 2: NY Governor Andrew Cuomo, "...when you're saying what happened in other countries vs. what happened here, we don't even think it's going to be as bad as it was in other countries."</p>
<p>March 4: CNN Anderson Cooper tells people to be more concerned about the flu than the coronavirus.</p>
<p>March 9: Forbes states, "Covid-19 travel update: Fauci says cruising is ok if you are healthy."</p>
<p>President Trump sent a Naval Hospital Ship to New York and California.  He had an emergency medical facility built in New York with over 2,000 beds.  He shipped over a thousand ventilators to New York.  Governor Cuomo announced on the air publicly that he would flat out refuse any and all help from Trump and he was true to his word- he didn't use ANY of that.  He instead signed executive orders along with the governors in Michigan, New Jersey, and a few other Democrat States that forced nursing homes to keep all covid patients indoors instead of sending them to hospitals.  This caused tens of thousands of deaths!</p>
<p>But yeah, keep blaming Trump for this.</p>

        <p>And do you really want to talk about Europe?  Fine.  Let's talk about how your governments are firing doctors for speaking out against lockdowns EVEN THOUGH the World Health Organization has even said how many people the lockdowns are killing and how bad they are.  </p>
<p>Or can we talk about how doctors are being fired when they talk about how empty hospitals are because there are no covid patients?</p>
<p>Or can we talk about the people who are thrown in jail for being caught outside instead of being locked inside their homes for a pandemic that doesn't exist?</p>
<p>I'm glad I don't live in your fucking continent.</p>

        <p>This depends. Did they have Covid antibodies upon death or have they had any contact with a suspected case of Covid in their lifetime ? If yes to any of the above, it's a Covid death.. oxygen to the brain was lacking and caused them to attract a truck to run over them.</p>

        <p>I'm not worried. Children can't get it at all, and it's not like any government or health agency is going to rush testing on kids. By the time they start testing on kids, the target demographic will be nearly covered (front line health care workers and the elderly/vulnerable).</p>
<p>If the vaccine does what they say it does, the hospitalizations and deaths should drop dramatically, but spread will continue.</p>

        <p>Almost of those could be flattened by putting into place a temporary or permanent UBI. So yeah, we could flatten numerous of those curves.</p>
<p>The only ones that cannot be flattened (if they are even going up in the first place) are the domestic abuse and child abuse one but here is the thing: Neither domestic abuse nor child abuse according to Soc. Workers I know and respect have actually gone up.</p>
<p>The only thing that has happened is that both are not being reported to the cops because the usual reporters are not schools but friends of the children of the family.</p>

        <p>UBI would only further devaluate the currency and facilitate unemployment. Money in itself is not wealth, it's the goods and services that it can buy. If there is nobody producing goods and services, there is no wealth, no matter how much monopoly dollars you have.</p>

        <p>You're right. No good jobs. We're all sitting huddled in unheated, dimly-lit hovels, chewing moldy bread and day-old lettuce we got at the food bank, waiting for some government official to grant us magical income. ;)</p>
<p>There have never been an overabundance of "secure, good-paying jobs." To get a job that is secure, you have to be able to identify what skills you can bring to the table now, and what skills you can develop that will make an employer want to invest capital to hire you.</p>
<p>That's life's little secret: YOU are the catalyst for your employment future. Not what school you attend, not what degree you spend six figures getting. It's you who can assess your own strengths and weaknesses, you who can research various career options, and you who can contact people who are doing what you want to be doing and ask them what steps they took to get there. Sadly, people do think that all of the above happens in college, but that's not so. All of the above needs to happen before a single college application is submitted. Otherwise, you'll be standing in a black gown with a diploma in one hand and a massive bill in the other, wondering where all the jobs have gone.</p>

        <p>Boomer bootstrapism just doesn't fly anymore. It's not the 1950s. If you lose your job, you can't walk down the street and have another in an hour. People can see with their own two eyes that it's not about "skills," or "researching," or "networking."</p>
<p><strong><em>THERE ARE NO GOOD JOBS. EMPLOYERS ARE NOT OFFERING THEM.</em></strong></p>
<p>All the skills, researching, and networking in the world do not put want ads in the paper. </p>
<p>The "socialism" vs. "individualism" meme is dead, because in any competitive game, individualists get trounced every single time, without fail. It's "global liberalism" vs "nationalism" now. Bargaining power matters, and you have no bargaining power when employers can pick up immigrants and H1-B's (or outsource), which makes people desperate for <em>any</em> work, no matter how long the hours, how miserable the conditions, or how low the pay.</p>

        <p>Fine. We're back to my initial, facetious comment, but now I'm making it in earnest: There are no good jobs on your horizon. You can try to better yourself, you can rack up severe debt on higher education, you can work your fingers to the bone and be unappreciated, you can stay home and pray that someone, somewhere will help you. But in the end, you have no hope. </p>
<p>Strangely, I know of no one who feels that way. The people in my life work in health care jobs, service jobs, skilled trades, and administrative jobs. Some went to college, some to trade school, some took classes for specific certification, some got experience in their field in the military. (Actually, the most successful of my friends and family went the military route. Almost all who took that track own homes and live comfortably.)</p>
<p>Do my friends and family have struggles? Find themselves with too much month at the end of their money? Dream of one day hitting the Powerball so they can give up the rat race? Sure. But that's life, and there's no changing it (well, without the Powerball, of course). So you can flop onto your bed and bemoan your fate, or you can get up and do something. But blaming Changing Times, or Capitalism, or Boomers, or Government, or even The Pandemic accomplishes NOTHING.</p>
