    <strong>It‚Äôs time to do something</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôm tired of the complaining and the memes. We watched a wide spread fraudulent election and no one cares so what makes you think protesting and signing petitions actually matters anymore? We‚Äôve lost our republic and all I see is complaining. It‚Äôs time to go to every major and governors house and let them know how angry we are at the self isolation, loss of jobs, the loss of liberty! Our ancestors made the red coats miserable and poured tea into the ocean and created chaos over taxes! Just taxes! And here we are making memes and complaining on the internet and calling it activism. I want to see people every single day outside the capitol building and houses and vacation homes of the elites and make their lives hell. If your not willing to fight and die free not for yourselves but at least for our children. Then everyone should just line up and getting ready for the fema camps. I don‚Äôt care if I get million downvotes for this post some of you need to hear this and I‚Äôm tired of sugarcoating the situation.</p></p>

        <p>I have a three step plan which I am trying to put into motion.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adopt a symbol that people can literally wear on their person. I think that this is critical to growing our numbers and signalling to the sheep that we are <em>not</em> all a unified herd. </li>
<li>Form a decentralized and democratized protest leadership (Hong Kong protest style) and use this to create many pop-up, spontaneous rallies which require little planning.</li>
<li>As numbers grow, protests shift to demonstrations of non-compliance and the non-compliance starts small but becomes more dramatic as numbers grow. </li>
</ol>
<p>I think that this is the way to do it. Skip any step and you won't be successful in the end. No symbol and you don't get numbers. No decentralized protests and you won't get any real activism started and you will be quashed by the police. Don't demonstrate non-compliance and you will not have enough leverage to negotiate with the government.</p>

        <p>I mentioned in another comment on this post a suggestion to launch a campaign to get anti-lockdowners to wear a white hat. This would be the symbol. If you like this idea spread it around, see if other people like the idea too.</p>
<p>Otherwise, attend protests, advertise and try to organize one yourself if you can. This will help.</p>
<p>If you like my three step plan see if you can run with it yourself. I will be working on something myself as well but I have absolutely no desire to bogart the leadership on this. If somebody else manages to put something better into motion before I do then that's great. I just want all this madness to end, don't really care how it happens. </p>
<p>I am working on creating a platform for a decentralized leadership. I settled on making a wiki where people can start to organize protests because it is low tech and easy to set up. It's also quite crude though and I'm starting to second guess this. I am able to write software to build something a bit more apropos but this is more difficult than you might think and I also don't know exactly what kind of shape it should take (but I'm open to suggestions).</p>

        <p>Re: 1.</p>
<p>Remember that the media will use this symbol against you once they figure it out.  Look at the ok sign, those frog memes, anti maskers, etc.</p>
<p>Learn from BLM and antifa how they use slogans that have built in immunity.</p>
<p>So, some preliminary slogans/symbols ideas:  a red cross bracelet, poor people need help, equality for people.  You can take this absurdly far and make it Save grandma, and always insist its about saving grandma, when it in fact has other goals.  See antifa for proof.</p>
<p>Anything anti mask, no new normal shouldn't be used, unless your goal is solely to identify people you can gather with in a windowless basement, with no electronic devices on.</p>

        <p>Love this one. Very excellent slogan.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for a generic white hat is that you don't have to worry about availability. But then you can also add a logo or a slogan like this for anybody that wants one and can get one.</p>

        <p>Learning from BLM and antifa is a very good idea. I'm going to look into this, definitely. </p>
<p>A had an idea to simply wear a white, or mostly white hat which I posted yesterday but it got buried and didn't gain much traction. I know this has the disadvantage that people will eventually be targeted but it has the advantage that it is simple enough to go main-stream. I also think that it is necessary that this is worn by people in public so that people on the other side physically feel the presence of the anti-lockdown side so as to directly challenge their group-think and herd-induced fear. </p>
<p>It is also non confrontational or explicitly anti-mask or anti-lockdown like you say in your very good point:</p>
<p>&rt; Anything anti mask, no new normal shouldn't be used, unless your goal is solely to identify people you can gather with in a windowless basement, with no electronic devices on.</p>
<p>Also, if people continue to wear their masks you can retain your anonymity with your symbol. Makes it less risky.</p>

        <p>Hey I‚Äôm with you. Actually it should have been done long ago, surely after the patriot act was passed after 9/11. The people gave up more and more of their freedom, happily, which paved the way for this. I think we have enough of the populace it‚Äôs only a matter of how bad people are willing to actually stand up and take back their lives. The elites are certainly not gods, the bigger issue is the mass compliance and brainwashed majority. The best thing we can do is just quit going along with it and start forming alliances.</p>

I was hoping by making this post it would inspire some ideas of what we could do. The petitions and waiting around the people to save us isn‚Äôt working.</p>

        <p>There is good news in all of this. The number of people who (sort of) understand what is going on has really jumped since covid. I had my wake up call with the 2008 housing market collapse, but I can remember hating people who were 9-11 truthers.</p>
<p>We're obviously not at critical mass yet, and we are preyed upon by grifters, but I can see light at the end of the tunnel. It may not be 2021, but at some point in the next few years they are going to have too many conspiracy theorists to supress without extreme measures.</p>

        <p>I went through a 6 week mental breakdown that just ended in a major emotional collapse. <br>
I am fed up living in someone other peoples lies, for I have already been doing it for years and I want my life back now.   </p>
<p>I need to reclaim my own life back...Starting with the masks<br>
- I will have a mask on when I walk into a store (so I am not immediately turned away)<br>
- Take the mask off when inside the store, while shopping<br>
- Put mask on when going up to pay<br>
- If I am asked to put my mask on by another shopper - I ignore them completely<br>
- If I am asked to put my mask on by an employee - I leave the store</p>

        <p>I definitely feel that is a start. Start small building confidence to stand up is the best place to start. 
I understand how you feel I‚Äôve been silent and compliant for to long.  I started off not wearing my mask even when asked. My confidence has been building from there.</p>

        <p>I do not care who looks at me strange in a store for not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>I do not have the energy to engage in a pissing content with strangers either.</p>
<p>I am not wearing a mask to save anyone else in the not so distant future - <br>
I am NOT wearing a mask to save myself today!</p>

<p>This is a nice idea, far less conflict potential and people inside will assume you already came without one - which makes it even a stronger form of resistance from their perspective, which is good.</p>
<p>I would always pay cash though, so they don't have your details in case you are technically forced to wear one and could be robbed ("fined").</p>
<p>I would also have a few replies ready for people wanting you to muzzle up (<em>"Don't worry you are safe behind your cloth."</em>)</p>

        <p>You‚Äôre right. And we can all be useful.</p>
<p>Admittedly a little rusty in my skills, but it‚Äôs clear to me that we need a new platform that encourages free speech. It‚Äôs ridiculous to see Alex Jones get muted on every platform - regardless of whether you think his content is fruitful or not, misinformation or not, he deserves his voice. </p>
<p>And that is the precedent - these big tech moguls dominate internet traffic, and really have monopolized in doing so. We need alternative options to what we have available and what is popular, so they can no longer control the narrative. </p>
<p>Same can be said with a non biased, fact-based news source.</p>

        <p>Our situation right now reminds me of a quote from the Running Man.</p>
<p>"<strong>All</strong> I've seen is a <strong>bunch of low foreheads</strong> who think they can change the world with dreams and <strong>talk</strong>. It's too late for that. If you're not ready to act, shut up.‚Äù</p>
<p>I'm ready and willing, but there's too much to lose as a single person.  Plus who do we target? Are we suggesting assassination? murder? secession?Any option requires organizing as a large group and we just don't have that at the moment.</p>
