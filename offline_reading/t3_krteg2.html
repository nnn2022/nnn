    <strong>What has been your experience at the gym?</strong>
    <p><p>I was inspired to make this thread after reading a comment in r/LockdownSkepticism wherein the commenter felt relieved to go to the gym and be surrounded by more normal people.</p>
<p>For me, returning to the gym has been bittersweet. I imagined, like perhaps many here, that I would be surrounded by like-minded people since they are by definition brave enough to be at the gym. I've found that to be only partially true.</p>
<p>First, every single person at my gym wears their mask assiduously. Of course, masks are mandated in all indoor venues in my state--but I am amazed at the universal adherence at the gym of all places. Our state's executive order even explicitly outlines an exception for indoor mask use when engaging in high intensity aerobic or anaerobic activity. Still, the compliance rate in my gym is virtually 100%. There are gym-goers whose masks are soaked through and through with sweat--at which point the mask is not only ineffective but harmful--yet they still persist in wearing it. I wear a mask to enter the gym and then lower it below my nose for the entire workout. I am literally the only person who does this.</p>
<p>But more disturbing than that is the obsessive <em>spraying of everything</em>. All gym-goers have access to their own personal bottle of disinfectant spray, and after using a piece of equipment, they will spray down <strong><em>everything</em></strong>. They don't just spray the seat/bench (which was not uncommon pre-covid). They will spray the free weights, the grips, the pin that's used to change the weight setting on machines, and even the weight plates on the machines (which typically don't get touched when using the machine). And not just a little spray--they will <em>douse</em> everything, to the point where when I use the machine after them, it is still <em>sopping wet</em>. At times I've struggled to maintain my grip on handles because they are completely saturated with disinfectant. The smell of disinfectant permeates the entire gym. Note that the spraying is not mandated by the gym--these people are doing it on their own accord.</p>
<p>For me, seeing people who are (ostensibly) not completely driven by fear (since they're at the gym after all) <em>nonetheless</em> feel compelled to follow these pointless, non-sensical routines like automatons has actually been quite dispiriting. I've come to realize that even people who are not necessarily fearful of the virus itself will nonetheless follow along with any sort of behavior--so overwhelming is the desire to conform and be thought of as a 'good person'. I thought that my return to the gym would be life-affirming, but it has somehow left me more disappointed in humanity.</p>
<p>I have anecdotally passed by gyms in other states, and I have not seen the sort of craziness that occurs at my gym. So I am curious: what has been your experience at the gym? Assuming, of course, gyms are even open in your area.</p></p>

        <p>I go to a gym 2 or 3 times a week (I have my own barbell and weights so I mostly work out at a park) but for heavier lifts like squats and bench, I’ll go to my 10 dollar gym. </p>
<p>If I’m doing cardio to warm up my legs or something ill have the mask under my nose because who wants to breathe their own shit while your heart rate is going up it’s just uncomfortable. </p>
<p>The kid gym employees will pop up out of no where and signal me to put it back over my nose. </p>
<p>When this happens you get looks from other lifters and it’s a very strange cult like sensation. Like you’re an outcast for wanting to breathe. </p>
<p>I am completely aware these kids are just following the rules of their job to pay through college so of course I’m not gonna be a dick to them. </p>
<p>But it is really strange and makes me want to not go to the gym.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t know. I quit my longtime gym in July after they mandated masks inside during all exercise including cardio. When I called to quit, they said if it was because of the mask mandate, and if so I could sign a waiver that would excuse me from wearing one. I still quit because I refuse to play their games.</p>
<p>For about a month the gym was pretty sweet. Low volume,  no masks, just people working out. But then they instituted the mask mandate and that changed the whole vibe to one of fear and oppression.</p>

        <p>I would say about half the people at my gym wear masks. It's not required by the city though. Spraying down equipment hasn't really increased passed the usual wiping down of machines after using them.</p>

        <p>I stopped going when they mandated we had to wear masks unless actively working out; between sets and I super set all workouts. I hated looking around and seeing the representation of fear (masks) in the place that is a my version of church or peace. Also I’m not risking sweating in a dirty mask and causing adult acne, call me vain but this shit has taken enough from me at least let me have my vanity. Lol Now the gyms are closed entirely here and I still won’t go back if we have to wear masks, I miss it but my at home set up works well enough.</p>

        <p>my old gym requires masks and you have to make a reservation and all these things. It's a climbing gym though, and everyone is touching the same climbing holds but you don't have to wear a mask while actively climbing when often times on slab your face is right next to a climbing hold that someone just breathed on, it's just all theater in my mind. They know their clientele though and the climbing community is a bit..well it seems to me they know their members have bought into a lot of the hysteria. people wearing masks while sprinting on the treadmill..just ridiculous.</p>
<p>I'm at another gym now where masks are basically not required, there are daily basketball meetups and tennis leagues and just no one really cares. More of an older clientele though.</p>

        <p>My long term gym was exactly like this, because i live in pretty much the strictest state for masks i was kicked out multiple times for having my mask on my chin even while drinking water or doing intense cardio. It got to the point where they suspended my membership. Luckily at this exact time i happened to find out about a family owned gym that didn't follow any of the state mandates a bit of a drive from where i live but i gave it a try. I walked in and got a friendly handshake from the owner, not the elbow, nobody had masks on, everyone was near each other talking like normal people. First time i felt normal all year. Gave them every dime they deserve for going against the mandates. It's still the only place i go where things are normal. Also goes without saying but this gym hasn't had any cases and has been open with no masks the entire year...</p>

        <p>I go to Lifetime Fitness which requires masks but does not really enforce it. I wear one when walking from the lobby to the changing room and again from the changing room to the gym entrance. I then take it off and work out and nobody says a thing. I'd say about 75% of the people in the gym don't wear masks either and no does that BS of taking off the mask at a machine and putting it back on when walking to another one. I live in Georgia, though, so this may be different in other Lifetimes in blue states. However, I'm worried we might be getting more restrictions soon with this state becoming full of libtards.</p>

        <p>I’m super fortunate. I work in a gym that technically isn’t supposed to be open, but our little town in California isn’t playing those games. My coworkers wear masks a fair amount, I won’t unless my manager tells me to. But I normally don’t work with her, so it really doesn’t happen often. Only about 2% of our members wear a mask, so in general it really feels like such a breath of fresh air and normalcy coming in here. Literally just today during my shift I saw two people hug before going their separate ways. I love it here so much.</p>
