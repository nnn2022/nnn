    <strong>It’s comical but also deeply sad how quickly “incel” was replaced with “covidiot”</strong>
    <p><p>I remember honestly since around 2015 suddenly everyone was an incel. It peaked once the media got ahold of it and they started using it in law and order etc. suddenly everyone that had an opinion different to someone was an incel. I even saw ludicrous situations where someone would post a story about a guy got fired for being racist or something and all the comments were “serves you right you fucking alt right incel” even though the story clearly made references to the guys wife and kids. </p>
<p>It was like watching a 10 year old learn swear words for the first time. </p>
<p>Now? Gone. Vanished. Now it appears no one is an “alt right incel”. Instead apparently the internet is full of “fucking anti-maskers who probably just can’t stand to smell their own breath 😂” or “morons who think you get 5G with the jab. Sounds awesome, sign me up!”. Or “idiots who think Bill Gates has personally paid each nurse in the world to put a microchip in each vaccine dose”. </p>
<p>These people are just.. like I’m really not sure. They truly do just change their vernacular, and what they hate based on what they’re told. It’s unsettling.</p></p>
