<p>&rt; Variola major kills around twenty to forty percent of infected humans who are not immune to it, depending on the circumstances of the outbreak and how virulent, or hot, the strain is.</p>
<p>Demon in the Freezer by Richard Preston</p>
<p>&rt; According to research published in the monthly Nature Medicine journal, the death rate from the coronavirus disease, COVID-19, in Wuhan -- the epicenter of the global outbreak -- was 1.4%.</p>
<p>&rt; Underlining that fatality risk was higher for the elderly, the study found 2.6% mortality rate among people over 60 years in Wuhan, 0.5% for people aged between 30 to 59, and 0.3% for people under 30 years.</p>

        <p>The difference being 30% chance of death versus 0.05% CFR.</p>
<p>If someone offered you a million dollars if you won the 70-30 game of Russian Roulette, you'd be less likely to bite than the offer of 99.95% chance of getting a million dollars versus 0.05% chance of being shot.</p>
<p>I hope all these phobiacs start reading about other diseases, even common things like flus that kill millions a year and how the flu vaccine is just a guess and usually has a 40% chance of being wrong, or how you have mosquitos in Massachusetts that can give you a 50% fatal disease, so really they should never leave their house in summer again.</p>
<p>There's never a reason to feel safe once you embrace the idea the world is trying to kill you.  Covid is just one option.  Just keep eating your donuts, healthy at every size.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Fauci flip flopping on masks, two weeks turns into 52+ weeks, early on compared coronavirus to a ‚Äúbad flu‚Äù until he wasn‚Äôt allowed to say that anymore, prediction models off by millions, endorsement of Tindr hookups in 2020, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDC changing the definition of herd immunity to no longer include ‚Äúinfection‚Äù as a means to achieve herd immunity because it‚Äôs inconvenient when the attempt is being made to have people get vaccinated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celebrities like Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, Jack Black, etc encouraging everyone to get vaccinated. This alone makes me immediately suspicious of whatever they‚Äôre saying is cool or to do. No thank you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daily advertisements on social media, tv, radio and billboards telling everyone to be vaccinated</p>

<p><strong>History of Scams</strong></p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùIn the great majority of cases the toll of the major killing diseases of the nineteenth century <strong>declined dramatically before the discovery of medical cures and even immunization‚Äù</strong> ^1</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùThe Rockefellers own the largest drug manufacturing combine in the world,</strong> and use all of their other interests to bring pressure to increase the sale of drugs.‚Äù ^2</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùRene Dubos, the microbiologist</strong> formerly with the Rockefeller Institute, succinctly summed up the historical record. <strong>‚ÄùThe tide of infectious and nutritional diseases was rapidly receding when the laboratory scientist moved into action at the end of the past century,"</strong> Dubos wrote in Mirage of Health. "In reality," he observed, <strong>‚Äùthe monstrous specter of infection had become but an enfeebled shadow of its former self by the time serums, vaccines, and drugs became available to combat microbes.</strong>‚Äù ^1</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùMany so-called "medical discoveries", however, have been announced by the <strong>Rockefeller Institute</strong>. Among them have been the <strong>supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever. All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable</strong> purposes and have been <strong>exploited commercially and intensively.‚Äù</strong> ^3:110</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùMuch of what you have been led to believe about immunizations simply isn't true.‚Äù</strong> ^4</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùIf immunizations were responsible for the diminishing or disappearance of these diseases in the United States, <strong>one must ask why they disappeared simultaneously in Europe, where mass immunizations did not take place.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùWith the polio vaccine we are witnessing a rerun of the medical reluctance to abandon the smallpox vaccination, which remained as the only source of smallpox-related deaths for three decades after the disease had disappeared.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùFor thirty years kids died from smallpox vaccinations even though no longer threatened by the disease.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mutant Strains Of Polio Vaccine <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/28/534403083/mutant-strains-of-polio-vaccine-now-cause-more-paralysis-than-wild-polio">Now Cause More Paralysis Than Wild Polio</a></p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùIn 1900 there were 13.3 measles deaths per 100,000 population. <strong>By 1955, before the first measles shot, the death rate had declined 97.7 percent to only 0.03 deaths per 100,000.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùIt has a well-oiled, well-heeled, well-greased chamber of commerce, known as the <strong>American Medical Association, working for drug profits day and night.</strong> If, incidentally, it increases the profits for medical doctors whose techniques cause a maximum of drugs to be bought, sold and used, the Drug Trust doesn't begrudge these doctors their fees.‚Äù ^2</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùThe further I looked into it, the more shocked I became. <strong>I found that the whole vaccine business was indeed a gigantic hoax.</strong> Most doctors are convinced that they are useful, but if you look at the proper statistics and study the instance of these diseases, you will realise that this is not so.‚Äù ^6</p>
<p>&rt;Dr. Archie Kalokerinos, MD, PhD, AMM, MBBS, FAPM, pediatrician for over 30 years.</p>
<p>&rt;‚Äù<strong>William Howard Hay, M.D</strong>.,who needs no introduction to the medical or drugless professions:</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùThe true figures on vaccination for smallpox have never got before the public, though they can be seen in the files of the various departments of the army as well as the government, if one cares to ask for them. <strong>If the record of vaccination in the Philippines alone were ever to become matter of general knowledge it would finish vaccination in the whole country,</strong> at least among those who are able to read and think for themselves.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùAfter three years of the most rigid vaccination,</strong> when almost every Philipino had been vaccinated from one to six times, <strong>there occurred the severest epidemic of smallpox that the islands had ever seen, with a death rate running in places to almost seventy per cent, and in all well over sixty thousand deaths. Did you ever know this before? Assuredly not.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùYet it is found in the government records in just this form. <strong>Manila and the surrounding province were vaccinated most thoroughly, also they showed the highest case record and death record of the whole archipelago,</strong> while some of the outlying country was not so thoroughly vaccinated and escaped with proportionately less disease."</p>
<p>&rt;‚Äú<strong>Professor Adolf Vogt,</strong> who held the chair of vital Statistics and Hygiene in Berne University for 17 years said: ^5</p>
<p>&rt;"After collecting the particulars of 400,000 cases of smallpox I am compelled to admit that my belief in vaccination is absolutely destroyed."  </p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùThe report of Dr. William Farr,</strong> Compiler of Statistics of the Registrar-General, London, states:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùSmallpox attained its maximum mortality after vaccination was introduced</strong>‚Ä¶..The mean annual (smallpox) mortality to 10,000 population from 1850 to 1869 was at the rate of (only) 2.04, whereas (after compulsory vaccination) in 1871 the death rate was 10.24 and in 1872 the death rate was 8.33, and this after the most laudable efforts to extend vaccination by legislative enactments."</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùI can remember the statement by Dr. Chester A. Stewart, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the Medical College of the University of Minnesota (subsidized with $216,-643 of Drug Trust money), writing in the Journal Lancet: ^2</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùThe occurrence of sudden shock reaction following the administration of serums to children who have been immunized by toxin-anti-toxin injections undoubtedly is far more common than a survey of the literature indicates. The writer has found considerable number of physicians who have had similar experiences which were not reported.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùWhy do doctors talk 'prevention' with such uncertain remedies? Why are they seeking the power to control the public,</strong> to compel the administration of their many questionable remedies? It may be a matter of humanity with some, but it is <strong>more a matter of money</strong> with those of the swivel chair type."</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùDOCTOR FORESEES A NATION OF INVALIDS</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Dr. S. S. Goldwater, New York Commissioner of Hospitals pointed out in The Modern Hospital Magazine that the present measures used to check contagious diseases may permit of longer life ‚Äî but not of stronger life. As a result of the drugs, vaccines and other suppressive treatments used to check diseases, he says that, "chronic diseases are growing at such a rate that America may become a nation of invalids. Over half the hospital beds are filled with chronic sufferers, both old and young." (from Health Practitioner‚Äôs Journal, June, 1944)‚Äù ^5</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùAs of 2003, SV40 had been found in human tumours in 18 developed countries. Bookchin and Schumacher claim that the rates of SV40-positive tumours seem highest in countries that used the greatest amount of contaminated Salk polio vaccine, including the UK, USA, and Italy.‚Äù ^7</p>
