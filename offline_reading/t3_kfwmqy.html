<p>&rt; Deaths among people age 25 to 44 climbed to historic highs in the first  few months of the pandemic, and July may have been the deadliest month  for young adults in modern American history. </p>
<p>These are not COVID deaths. These are lockdown deaths. The largest increase in deaths was among this age group, not the elderly. This is not because this group is susceptible to the pandemic.</p>
<p>This is blatant and obvious fearmongering, which most people will fall for. And if they can't get them with this, they'll try long COVID lies about how 80% of people will end up with permanent lung damage.</p>

        <p>I made a post on /r/lockdownskepticism debunking the article they cite. If you actually look at the data (which they skew) covid-19 is responsible for a fraction of the excess deaths. We can probably attribute the rest to lockdowns.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/kf7wr6/fear_mongering_in_the_ny_times_people_thought/</p>
<p>&rt; In 1995, HIV infection was the leading cause of death among Americans ages 25 to 44 and accounted for 19% of deaths from all causes in this age group. At that time there were about 13,000 young Americans dying per month, Faust said, “And we have just gone right past that this year. And it was not just because the population is bigger; it’s actually very similar in that age group. So now we’ve got 16,000 [deaths per month]; 15,000 in the fall.”</p>
<p><a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-S/9bhg-hcku">According to the CDC's data,</a> 7,070 Americans ages 25-44 died of COVID-19, out of 147,687 deaths total over the same time frame. So about 4.8% deaths of that age range are due to COVID-19, and it's probably even less considering how liberally the CDC counts COVID-19 deaths. And he compares this to HIV/AIDS being responsible for 19% deaths of people the same age range in 1995? Despicable.</p>
