    <p><ol>
<li>
<p>Would it not conflict with their sustainability agenda to make a vaccine which may allow you to live longer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it a concern that the vaccine may in fact be designed to shorten your life, so as to help the sustainability goals?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have complete trust that the companies care about you and would not get conflicted by their sustainability goals?</p>

        <p>Not specifically because of this, but I don't trust these companies. They are immune to liability. Huh? Imagine if auto manufacturers had this privilege.</p>

        <p>I love that analogy. Going to use it. Who would buy a car if you had to sign a waver not allowing you to sue the car maker if its vital parts failed while driving it and killing you? No one.</p>

<li>Eugenicists and neo-Malthusian technocrats have ALWAYS been involved with the pharmaceutical industry. ALWAYS.</li>
<li>This is what the 'conspiracy theorists' said from the onset - why would people who have always complained about the human population want to save you so that you can live longer and procreate more NOW that they have access to your bloodstream?</li>
<li>"Sustainability" is just a euphemism for depopulation and the drastic reduction of humanity's living standards.</li>
