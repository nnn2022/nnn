    <strong>I’ve come to the realization that the Doomers are the selfish ones.</strong>
    <p><p>I got my wisdom teeth pulled on Friday so I’ve been sitting in bed recovering and doing a lot of thinking. I’m sure you guys have come to this realization already but it’s just coming to me. </p>
<p>The 30 year old Doomer who has a comfortable WFH job knows what the 19 year old college freshman is going to have either no school year, or a very bad one. The Doomer doesn’t care about the kid, they care about looking good and wanting everything locked down so they can support “saving lives.” So they support lockdowns and shame young people for having fun. </p>
<p>I’d say a lot of us here want things to open back up because people are suffering. I’m very lucky, I’m doing well and I’m so grateful to be where I am. I’m donating to food banks a lot lately because I know people aren’t doing good now. Doomers want to stay locked down because they want to be “right.” They want to be “correct.” They want to be seen as the morally superior at the cost of millions of jobs and lives destroyed. I don’t think many of them actually care about the sick, the old, or the vulnerable. </p>
<p>I think a lot of them are lazy too. People tell us that we don’t need to go out and do stuff, we can just stay at home and have stuff delivered for date night. Goddamnit I just want to go out and have dinner with my husband or my family or whoever the fuck I want. I want to go ice skating. I want to go to theme parks. I want to do all those goofy weekend things. These fucks were always lazy but now they use lockdowns as justification for it. </p>
<p>Don’t even get me started on kids and online school. My siblings’ kids are doing it and it sounds horrible. These poor kids aren’t going to be doing well. Doomers have the audacity to say that is is okay to “protect people?”</p>
<p>Fuck your Doomers. I know you only do this because you’re lazy and want to be right. It’s not about “protecting people,” it’s about your insecure asses wanting to be correct. Fucking degenerates.</p></p>

        <p>Spot on. </p>
<p>I tweeted last night that I can’t even handle the people tweeting things like “check on your friends, even if they say they’re fine. It’s suicide awareness month”. I said I won’t soon forget the people who retweet something like that then follow up with a tweet “the virus doesn’t care about what you’ve lost”. </p>
<p>Yeah I won’t be letting these fucking people get away with their nasty, mean, spiteful virtue signaling. I’ve lost all respect and friendships with many over this but I sleep just fine at night knowing I gave a shit about more than just a virus with an AT MOST .65% IFR that people were more than willing to toss society and everything we’ve been doing for thousands of years in the trash for. It is not selfish of me to ask “but what about the people in impoverished countries who rely on the 1st world to not starve to death?” I cared about those people before this and not out of virtue. Meanwhile the people who would’ve reposted countless aid banners for 3rd world hunger in February immediately call ME selfish for wondering about them over the 85 year old suffering in a nursing home who got a full, free life.</p>
<p>I am not selfish. I’m not very religious but if there is a God, I don’t think they would consider me selfish either. I’m not so selfish and myopic as to think we can put every fucking egg in the covid basket then just flip the switch when some arbitrary metric is reached. It’s a sign of lack of intelligence if you can’t see the forest  through the trees of something like this and it’s selfish to dig your heels in when someone tells you there’s more to be concerned with than just covid. I’m sick of this shit. They can call me selfish but I will never let them have peace regarding their own selfishness and disregard for their “friend’s” mental health in all this. Fucking scumbag people right there.</p>

        <p>I had a thought about this earlier.  I have had a lot of time to think about this which is why I share my thoughts about this as much as I do.</p>
<p>There is a social contract and those whom we call "doomers" have taken advantage of the good natures of people.  </p>
<p>The social contract does state that we should be good to each other, yes.</p>
<p>However, it is not carte blache for one side to make demands without concessions for the other side.  It is not for one side of the argument to say: "We have all of the bargaining chips.  You have no say in the matter.  We believe that what we are doing is right and you must give us whatever we ask for."</p>
<p>The social contract is not unilateral.  The other side must be able to say, "but what do I get in return?"  If that benefit is not tangible to the other side, not useful in any way (i.e., "you saved countless (read: some number of lives that equals zero or greater) lives!") as if there is any comfort to being screwed over.   Those saved lives aren't paying your bills or feeding your children.  You can't patch the hole in your roof with the good feeling of having saved a life that wouldn't even be bothered to say "thank you".  You can't fix the pipes with the life that may not have even ever gotten the virus if we can account for all variables.</p>
<p>They'll smugly sitting on the other side of the table with all of the benefits, and none of the downsides, and they'll tell you how grateful you should be about everything.  </p>
<p>But <em>you</em> had to make all the sacrifices.  <em>They</em> had to give <strong>nothing.</strong>  "Greater good," they say.  Sure.  <em>Their</em> greater good.  Not sure what was so good about it for you.  </p>
<p>The social contract is broken.  And we didn't break it.  We're just calling out the bastards who keep claiming that morale can be improved with more whippings.</p>

        <p>I don't get how people don't see that as selfish.</p>
<p>They tell you, "it's not all about YOU".  The only problem is, by saying that, they make it all about THEM.  Because it might not be all about them, but a reasonable person is willing to concede something if they get something worth having out of the deal.</p>
<p>When you say, "it's not all about you", you'd better be able to tell them that at least <em>some</em> of it is.</p>

        <p>So they don't care about you or people at your gym. It sucks you lost a close friend but someone that angry isn't necessarily someone you want in your life. Maybe after all this they'll calm down and ask for forgiveness or try to gloss over their mistakes, at that point it'd be up to you to decide to forgive, forget and move on or not.</p>

        <p>Well, I think we've all lost people over this. I can't hang with people that want others to die just so they can feel good about themselves, which "I hope you and everyone at your gym die" is. </p>
<p>I'm reminded way back when the Vietnam war was over, vets were spat on and insulted when they came home, and people that did that felt very good about themselves at the time. Today you'll not hear one person brag about insulting the Nam troops coming home. </p>
<p>I think this incident will be like that- when it's all over, and the self righteousness fades, all the virtue signalers will forget about the time they harangued and even assaulted people for not wearing a mask; well, maybe not forget, but I'm sure they won't admit to it.</p>

        <p>The kids thing really gets to me. I don’t have kids and I feel so incredibly sorry for people who do. “The possibility of in-person school being suddenly shut down” has never been on my bingo card of reasons for not having kids but now it is. Unless one parent (usually the woman in a male/female relationship) wants to give up their career and life to sit at home or be able to drop their career and life at a moment’s notice, I don’t see how any family could manage that kind of uncertainty.</p>

        <p>I’ve been saying this for a while. </p>
<p>It never made sense to me how we’re the selfish ones for wanting things like the choice to go to sporting events or restaurants to reopen. But it’s NOT selfish of the doomers to insist we alter our entire way of life because they’re afraid and want to dictate what we can do? It’s incredibly selfish to say “don’t do this thing because I might get sick.” If that person isn’t living in your house, you have no right to dictate their life.</p>

        <p>It's to the point I have to control my anger when some one talks about being for covid mesures.Yea there's a virus.Yea people should stay home if their sick....but that's such a small number.</p>
<p>Were where we are because the most insulated people on the fucking planet are scared or lazy.</p>
<p>Everyone of my family members has been negitively affected by the mesures and not the virus.Lost jobs,fucked work policies,online school without proper internet access.I was litterly stuffed into a 8×10 room,basicly solitary confinement for two weeks.Then did manual labor,12 hrs a day in a mask.</p>
<p>The only one thats remotly doing ok is in the medical feild(non covid related.).I've had to lend thousands of dollars to help my some of my cyblings that got royaly fucked.Since their industry has been  shut down.</p>
<p>Im to the point where I have to contain fits of rage and keep from crying.Cause theres not a dam thing I can do.
The only fucking thing between the new normal and just normal is people perspective.Not even normal people.Fuck heads sitting in an office and fucking cowards in power.</p>
<p>We're where we are because fucking yellow bellyed,cowards.</p>

<p>My response: You are not guaranteed to have that year to wait.  You are not guaranteed to have even one more day to wait.</p>
<p>When people tell you that you have to wait on some arbitrary timeline - which nobody seems to be able to tell you that anyone will keep a promise on - then why abide by it? </p>
<p>The social contract regarding timelines was broken after the first month of hysteria.  Now, it's down to, "Who cares how much time you're stalling for?  You're a liar and there's no reason for us to give you even so much another ten minutes."</p>

        <p>no one said this would be over in a month and it sure will vary even state to state. Some people might have some timelines and they hope they are correct but it is merely hope, so sure it may be longer than a year, it might be less as well, either way it is happening and since you clearly did not bother to do that calculation for a 25yo, your using 4% at a full year of the life you lived so far to potentially save another yet that time is not worth it since on the off chance you may die as well, so you have to go do something everyday to appease yourself.</p>

        <p>I find it disturbing that people think it's acceptable when no one offers a strict timeline of events.  </p>
<p>Ever met someone who promised you something, but kept stringing you along.</p>
<p>"Just two weeks..." </p>
<p>"Maybe another month..."</p>
<p>"Possibly next year..."</p>
<p>At some point, you come to the conclusion that the people saying that have no idea what they're doing.  And by the way, they will <em>never</em> give you what you want if they know they can keep you on the hook for just a little bit loner.</p>
<p>Again, if they didn't put up solid numbers and would honestly post cases versus <em>actual deaths</em>, I might see clear to trusting the government on this.  </p>
<p>But that's not what they're doing.  They're just dangling carrots at this point, and the population should be far more pissed off about this, not sniping at each other over petty things like masks.  </p>
<p>And by the way "since you clearly didn't bother" sounds needlessly snippy.  I am not calculating anything simply because even one more hour of this insanity should be unacceptable to the average citizen.</p>
<p>Either tell me what "safe" is, and how we achieve safe (and "masks" and "vaccine" are the absolute wrong answers...oversimplifying a complex problem will never solve the problem, or have you ever done any <em>actual</em> math in your life?) and no moving the goalposts on safe, or I'm sorry, there should be giving no more inches, no more hours, nothing.</p>

        <p>It was never supposed to be this long. Do you not remember “15 days to slow the spread”?  </p>
<p>I lost a part time job because of this. I’m no longer allowed to sing in church if I were going. (Which I’m not because the church has also joined the hysteria.) Auite honestly I don’t think I should have to wait any longer to do the things I want to do. I want my life back NOW. I am goddamn fucking tired of people like you who want everyone else to stay home because it’s luxurious for YOU. I’m glad your life is going so well and you’ve never thought about suicide the longer this drags on. I’m glad you never lost income or got depressed from the lack of in-person contact. But that just means you refuse to understand the hardships others have faced from being cut off from every social and community outlet they had up until the middle of March because you are too weak and soft to let others take their own risk. </p>
<p>This is no longer my responsibility. I only care for myself and my family. Not about Reddit strangers. Not about some hypothetical immune compromised person I’ll never meet. The restrictions should have been over after a month at tops. You stay home and live your privileged life and let me make my own choices.</p>

        <p>Why would this end in a year? Fauci said a vaccine isn't 100% effective so deaths will not stop. It can literally just go on forever. There's already influenza vaccination and the deaths just keep on piling up year after year. </p>
<p>I don't care about not attending concerts so much. I care about the collapse of industries that kept the masses out of poverty. We haven't seen the settling of the chain of supply yet for everything that's about to go under. Life will be very, very ugly once the foundation has been shifted and take a decade to rebuild.</p>

        <p>how is it not harmful?
https://public.tableau.com/profile/dataviz8737#!/vizhome/COVID_excess_mort_withcauses_09022020/WeeklyExcessDeaths
This is the excess deaths or how many extra people in America have died over the last 3 years. We all know this is rough and on everyone but the time it takes will be over before you know it, not sure how long you have been on this earth but even if it's a whole year, take out a calculator and divide 1 by your age and move the decimal over to the right two spots and that is the percentage of your life that year is taking up to that point, it will likely be less than you imagine and if you stuck it out and 1 less person died, would that not be worth it and then some?</p>

        <p>&rt;it will likely be less than you imagine and if you stuck it out and 1 less person died, would that not be worth it and then some?</p>
<p>You're just going to call everyone selfish.  I can see that right now.</p>
<p>But I'll bite: this is 100% magical thinking.</p>
<p>And now I have to wonder what it is you think the real world is like.</p>
<p>Meaning, everything you do is likely to contribute to someone dying, whether it is driving (and yes, I saw your earlier post about biking, I'm generalizing to people who use the same arguments because like us, people like you don't exist in a vacuum), generating landfill, eating factory-farmed meat, using electronics, wearing clothes made in a sweatshop, climate change.  You are probably guilty of contributing at least one of those things.</p>
<p>Why is some arbitrary and rather hazy standard about what will contribute to "even one person's death" suddenly more important and urgent than all of those other things that have been around for years and we all know perfectly well about, certainly better than Coronavirus?</p>
<p>So, you know what would be "worth it"?  Never doing anything again ever.  Because that would be the only thing that would stop us from killing anyone from anything.  We'd kill ourselves from atrophy, sure, but at least we wouldn't be killing anyone else.</p>

        <p>Sure as can be I have contributed to global warming, virtually everyone has and that is way it is, it is unfortunate and all we can do on that subject is put our best foot forward and hope others will do the same.</p>
<p>It doesn't hurt to know you might be saving a life by doing so no? The reason above all though as to why the precautions with the virus is it is a new virus and has a strong chance of doing much more serious damage if we didn't try and slow down the infection rate.</p>
<p>It is not like you can not do something in your home like learn a skill online, play a game, you can still pick up food from restaurants, why is having lockdowns during spikes a bad thing? It can save lives and no, no ones death from this virus is on ANYONE, it is a virus that leaps from human to human, we are not blasting cannons of this stuff at each other.</p>

        <p>A year is a long time for your mind. Especially for the minds of kids and young adults. A lot of them will be permanently scarred, fall behind, and be broken because of this, for no fault of their own. Heck small kids are not even sure what's going on. They're pulling out their hair, literally. I'd advise you to understand how important social contact is, especially for young developing brains. Eg. isolated monkeys have been known to bash their heads against their cage walls and kill themselves.</p>

        <p>No, I can't wait a year. Why? Because despite being in my 20s I am well aware that I can die at any time. Time isn't guaranteed, I'm not even guaranteed seeing the sunset tomorrow nevermind still being here in a year to experience the things I enjoy, the things that make my life worth living. I know because I've faced my own near unexpected death more than once, completely out of the blue. I've also watched death happen - instantly in front of my eyes. I'll be damned if any government is going to rob me of MY precious time and any of my precious remaining youth in the name of this virus.</p>
<p>Time isn't guaranteed even for the young so I will <strong>not</strong> waste a moment of my life and put "fun" on hold. For so many of us, young and old, there will be no "in a year", there will be no next week! How selfish of you to assume all those you request to <em>just wait</em> will be alive to have fun at the end of next year or whenever you and your leaders see fit. More people have died this year from causes that are not this virus, and they've been robbed of their last days, months, or weeks of <em>living</em>. So I've gone to the movies, gone to the beach, danced secretly at night venues who are saying fuck the rules, been to a secret concert in the bush, restaurants, shopping, hugging and seeing friends... and I won't stop.</p>
<p>I don't give a damn when people like you feel safe or not. This is my life, you do as you wish with your time but I won't waste mine when I've stared death in the face. That "one person" you speak of could easily have died of influenza or some other infection this year. Or next year. You never gave a damn before and gave up living.</p>
<p>I for one am glad that in my state, in my country, many fun things minus nightclubs are open (no ridiculous masks which we don't use) because it means our young family friend with terminal brain cancer can in his last months do some of the few things he can still do and enjoy with family and friends. He can't even afford to wait a month because his mobility and sight is declining rapidly. You think he's worried about some virus? Nah he's worried about the monster in his head, a monster others aren't discovering early because of the ridiculous restrictions and lockdowns where they threw all else but this virus to the side. To hell with this virus and to hell with anyone who thinks others should be robbed of living in the name of <em>if it saves just one life</em> when it's actually ENDING lives.</p>

        <p>There’s a reasonable middle ground to take. You can avoid the high-risk activities like dancing in a nightclub and still enjoy life by going with low risk activities. </p>
<p>I hate this pandemic, we all hate this pandemic, but for fucks sake you have to consider the consequences of your actions. I want this shit over as soon as possible but we’re not gonna get that if asshats like you are shirking the rules. We’ve all had to make sacrifices this year, you’re not exception.

        <p>No. You can avoid them if you're worried. This virus doesn't warrant this destruction and missed life. I'll keep on dancing, but thanks. I'll also keep on hugging, my mental health - the greatest risk to my life and those my age - needs it. This virus isn't going anywhere, you know, it will always exist now. You can't hide from a virus, you can't make this end sooner by cancelling life. The only way it ends is when people learn to live with this virus' presence since it will always exist now. There is no way out that involves cancelling life and hiding, and that will absolutely not end anything sooner. </p>
<p>Btw, though my degree was psychology I studied as secondary electives subjects like microbiology, virology, immunology etc for 4 years as if I was healthy I would have gone into that area. This virus isn't going anywhere and it's clear as day. You can't hide from it to get out of this sooner, viruses don't work like that. Countries could have allowed life to go on while shielding the at risk mostly elderly, and actually protecting them which lockdowns and cancelling nightclubs didn't do. Instead they've prolonged their isolation which is KILLING them, as it killed my great uncle in a nursing home and caused a long drawn out death after torturing him for months. Sure, protecting them is what is being done. The harms of isolation were well known, something I actually studied in depth, but oh well pretend it's saving lives while they just die other ways...</p>

        <p>I take mental health very seriously and I think it’s important we recognize the harmful psychological effects of lockdown. But it’s not about “cancelling life” it’s about putting certain activities on pause for the greater good.
The problem is that these risk communication messages have been disseminated in a very black and white framework, it’s either you’re safe or not safe when in reality risk doesn’t work that way, the context reallymatters and we need to look at it as how much of risk we’re taking with certain things.
It’s fine to hug friends if you’ve set up a social bubble where everybody has agreed to follow certain measures. That’s what my friends and I have done. </p>
<p>Ive yet to see an argument why lockdown should be abandoned. I’m on the side of science and following in the footsteps of countries like New Zealand. I’m not even sure if lockdown is worth it and I think we’re all figuring it out as we go along, but I’m willing to be patient and wait to do certain things if that means I can protect other people. You should learn that to. Selfishness will never reward you, karma is a real thing and it always comes back to bite us in the ass.</p>

        <p>Lockdown doesn't work. It was never evidence-based. Never. It does nothing to even protect the most vulnerable. You have no idea. Lockdown isn't science. There's a reason it was never done before and it was done out of panic and politics this time. It's incredibly harmful and not just to mental health. New Zealand didn't eradicate covid despite harming their entire population. They are a tiny island in the middle of the ocean, with a tiny and sparce population where it was never going to pose a great issue yet even they could not erase and hide from covid. Their policy was not a success for reasons you don't seem to comprehend. Everywhere has its curve and lockdowns - not based in science - were not even presented as something to reduce infections or eventual deaths lol. This virus is here to stay <em>forever</em>, it's a highly successful virus. It's successful because for the majority of its hosts it is harmless, it doesn't make them severely ill and incapacitate them, it doesn't kill the vast majority. It's a virus that is here to stay with us forever for this reason.</p>
<p>Lockdowns were terrible public health policy and if you'd ever studied that you would know why.</p>

        <p>America never had a real lockdown, that’s why it doesn’t fucking work. If we tried to contain the spread at the beginning with a 3 week lockdown and universal basic income, we would be in a much better predicament.</p>
<p>Lockdown only works if it’s a full lockdown in a limited timeframe and there’s economic relief provided to everyone. 
I think what we’re doing right now ain’t working and there’s definitely a better way. That better way might mean a full lockdown for a couple weeks. If that’s the case I beg you to consider putting your activities on pause during that time. I’m tryna live my life too, we all are. I love going out. If we all cooperated we can get back to normal sooner rather than later.</p>

        <p>LOL the UK had an early, long and strict lockdown and it didn't work it and it killed and will continue to kill people. Peru had one of the LONGEST and strictest lockdowns and one of the highest death rates if not the highest in the world. The USA had in many states a stricter lockdown than I did in my state in Australia. People in my state where I'm located ignored even the rules we did have and had large parties and gatherings and the world didn't end.</p>
<p>Universal basic income won't stop the catastrophic harm of lockdowns 🤣</p>
<p>Name ONE place that had a limited time just 2 or 3 or even 4 week full lockdown that worked, one place that didn't just continue extending and extending the two weeks into months which greatly harmed people disproportionately to the damn virus. A full lockdown isn't even possible or good public health policy basic costs vs benefits. Lockdowns don't work, and never would with a virus. If you knew anything about viruses you'd know you can't hide from them. Can't hide and have them go away.</p>
<p>Quit your magical thinking "if we all cooperated" nah it doesn't work that way. The virus will do as it's going to do, humans aren't all powerful. It's not selfish to want to live while you can, when you know all too well you can die at any time. People have always died of viruses and even common cold viruses kill the vulernable - so you are selfish for ever having lived.</p>
<p>Edit to add - a group of men were on Antarctica for months without outside contact. They still managed to suddenly get a virus with respiratory symptoms. Astronauts are quarantined in state of the art facilities under medical staff before going to space, and yet even they still manage to get respiratory viruses in space. Hide from viruses? Lol, right.</p>

        <p>How the world always handled pandemics. Shield the vulernable, allow the virus to spread among the healthy with hygiene encouraged - it is going to spread no matter what you do - and that protects the vulernable because the virus' ability to spread so well is hindered. The ill self isolate. The vulnerable don't need to be isolated long-term as a result, which is a win if you know anything about the health effects of isolation. Isolation kills. People have no idea the harm it poses apparently.</p>
<p>This virus, though it's ability to spread will be limited now so many have had it but will infect and kill people each year, will be here to stay for the rest of our lives. Learn to deal with that fact.</p>
