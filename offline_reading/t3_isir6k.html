    <strong>How effective will tomorrow actually be?</strong>
    <p><p>Tomorrow is the global anti-mask protest right? Of course, I'm going to do it and most people in here but what about the majority of the world? Is it shared enough for enough people to know? I'd hate to let this opportunity go to waste, this has the potential to really change things</p></p>

        <p>you want everything to go back to normal soon? wear a face mask. listen to the people who know a lot more than you. thank you</p>
<p>edit: I'm prepared for the down votes. at least I listen to medical experts; people who know A LOT more than I do. oh yeah... can anyone explain why surgeons wear face masks and have been wearing them for ages, yet nobody has called that "tyrannical"? there's a pandemic going on right now and wearing face masks help slow the spread... they may not be 100 percent effective, but they are better than nothing. everything will go back to normal, but if you protest face mask mandates and lockdown, there will be people who will die. what if your friends and family were killed by it? what if you got it and had to be put in ICU? it may not happen, but there could be a chance of it. If you want to get through this, just consider lockdown and face masks as an <strong>investment</strong> for a better future... a COVID free future. a future where you can do normal tasks without face masks, social distancing, etc. I know some of you may be anti-vaxxers and even cautious about a COVID-19 or any vaccine being rushed. just keep in mind that they're going quick enough where they can get it out relatively soon, yet have a safe and effective vaccine. we'll get through this. trust me</p>

        <p>Yea because none of us are doing that. 🙄</p>
<p>Without getting into the full retard conversation with you, you clearly don't listen to the experts if you are banking on masks.</p>

        <p>I'm not "banking on masks". They're just a precautions... like social distancing, lockdown, etc. now, I'm willing to be proven wrong if evidence is presented. and what bias do I have? seriously. I'd like to work on these things.</p>

        <p>I am not going to engage in sea lioning because this has been played out a million times. </p>
<p>If masks work, what is social distancing for? If I social distance do I need a mask?</p>
<p>You have a CDC source, what does the CDC say about your chances of getting it walking past someone that's infected? Literally 0%.</p>
<p>What does the CDC say about getting infected? You have to be face to face, in close proximity for minutes to even risk it.</p>
<p>The micron size of the holes in most face coverings is larger than the virus. </p>
<p>This shit is so fucking old at this point that it actually disappoints me at how lemming like people are.  It's amazing to me that the actual science runs counter to what people are told, yet people claim their ass backward behavior is based on science. </p>
<p>Use some logic and reasoning.</p>
<p>Edit</p>
<p>If you are healthy and under the life expectancy, statistically and mathematically your chances of dying are approximately .04%, slightly less than 1/2 of 1%...yea shut the world down, it's the apocalypse.</p>

        <p>The disconnect necessary to form that opinion is astounding. </p>
<p>You have no continuity to your argument. If I always keep 6 feet, why do I need a mask?  If I don't have covid how can I kill people? Even if I do have covid, one has to be up close, like 2 feet, for several minutes to risk infection and you have a 0% chance of getting it walking past an infected person. </p>
<p>This is the science you doomers claim we all deny.</p>
<p>As a statistical fact: 250 000 people die each year taking pharmaceutical drugs AS DIRECTED.</p>

        <p>They don’t work 100% that’s why we need everyone to wear them not just some of them. You wouldnt try to fight a house fire cupping water in your hands if buckets were available.

        <p>Thousands of people dying isn’t worse than a house fire to you? I only meant it in the way that there is an issue that requires many hands and those that can help being unwilling is gross. You wouldn’t let your neighbors house burn down without trying to help would you? You would knock to wake them up, you’d call the fire department, you’d help your neighbors I would hope. If you aren’t that type it proves the point, you are capable only unwilling. The unwillingness to keep people safe is just astounding. I understand people that CANT wear masks, those that don’t because they don’t want to... I do things everyday I don’t WANT to do, pay taxes, do my dishes, scrub my toilet, wear shoes, wear clothes. That’s being an adult doing what you’re supposed to because there’s a clear benefit and little detriment to yourself. Wearing a mask hurts my ears, it breaks me out and my lips have been dry and cracking for months, I’m still willing to be uncomfortable so that someone doesn’t end up with scarred lungs, having a heart attack, having their organs fail, so that less people end up dying. This is more serious than a house fire. This is more serious than you seem to give credit to, people are dying and we can do something super duper simple to help not kill others.</p>

        <p>Fine, it’s like there’s a pandemic, and people are dying, and people won’t do something so simple to help out. Thanks for not offering up any true opposition, people aren’t taking this seriously, even if the numbers are halved, even if you believe this is overblown (which I agree with) the media always hyped everything up, but there are still people dying. You can still help people. You can choose to do your part to not injure, main someone’s organs, or kill them.</p>

        <p>People die everyday for a lot of preventable diseases. Cancer and heart disease, both largely preventable, kill car more people than covid, but no one seems to give a shit about them. Not to mention, most of the people who died of covid were of advanced age and had multiple causes of death. My mom used to work in hospice, people in nursing homes who are close to death will die from whatever their next illness is, sometimes they just get a cold and becuase they have bad immune systems the cold eventually becomes pneumonia and they die.</p>
<p>Paper masks simply do not prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, there is no scienitif research that supports the widespread use of masks as a means of curbing viral infections</p>

        <p>I think it’s highly regrettable people don’t tend to their health better, that they exacerbate the issue with diet, drugs, lack of exercise. I find it incredibly wrong, I however don’t believe children deserve to lose their parents, spouses don’t deserve to lose each other. Are you saying that because people die anyway it’s okay to just let them die, to actively reduces others chances of living? I hate driving for that very reason, people text and drive with their children in the back, it’s disgusting. I want people to be aware of their actions, even the far reaching ones. Most- that’s the operative word there, the middle aged group is highly affected, parenting age folk, with young kids. Do you think they just deserve to die from something that can be preventable if everyone did their part. Imagine the roads if everyone actually quit distracted driving, how fewer accidents and deaths we’d have. This is the same, the effort is not pointless, in fact it’s all we can do right now as regular citizens. I can’t make a vaccine, I can’t ventilate someone, I don’t know how to make ventilators correctly. I leave that work to them and I do my small but very important part of helping not spread this, so there will be fewer patients, fewer deaths, fewer people who lose family members, friends, neighbors, the cashier that always smiles at you. Your mail person. It doesn’t matter. Yes older people are mostly more susceptible to death through lighter causes. There are people of all ages dying from this. If we can even save one person how is that not worth it to you? Being somewhat uncomfortable when you have to go out is still less impactful than someone’s permanent damage or death.</p>

        <p>Paper masks aren't going to prevent anyone from dying. I wear one when I have to going into a store but there isn't any proof that they work, so I am against mass mandating of masks. I'm not killing anyone and a mask isn't saving anyone's life. </p>

        <p>I wear a surgical mask which does stop the directional expulsion of air going as far from your body than not wearing one at all. I wear a fabric masks over mine because the surgical masks are a bit ill fitting to my face. It’s not fool proof no, not 100%, it still mitigates some risk, especially coupled with social distancing and face shields. Most effective when you also quit going out for non necessities. Get your groceries, get your meds, people have to work I’m not stranger to the idea that these times are trying. But salons, restaurants, movies, parties, lunch dates, non essential stuff for life. We could cut back the numbers further. But people are unwilling to entertain themselves for a while. I’m not arguing with you on the efficacy of masks, I see people in handkerchiefs and I just sigh. If people used proper protection when they went out and lessened the amount they integrate with others we would slow down the spread, wouldn’t be able to spread to as many people, would hurt or kill as many people. I see loads though, hanging out in the pool with their kids and other neighbors. People still playing contact sports, people partying, celebrating birthdays with huge parties and shared space and food. Those aren’t essential to life and in fact they are the very thing killing others. It’s a matter of will power, are you really so unwilling to use protection during these times to help protect people? Why are you arguing this? You can do something simple to help? Why is that hard for you?</p>

        <p>Your wall of text won't change the fact that masks have not been proven to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. If they did work then there would be a discernable decrease in new cases once mask mandates were put in place, but that never occurred. Wear a mask if it makes you feel better but just realize that wearing a mask to prevent covid is akin to using holy water to protect against covid.</p>
<p>Also, I refuse to live like that. If someone wants to isolate themselves then they should have that choice. Let the rest of us live our lives and you can stay sheltered indefinitely</p>

        <p>That’s not true, there are multiple studies showing that wearing a face covering (they even compare the differences in protection from which type of masks) is effective in decreasing spread from the user. A three fold decrease. That’s not nothing. Do not for a second think I’ll let you lie here. You can say your opinion but that is not an opinion, you stated it as fact and that’s just not true. They have been PROVEN to reduce personal spread through droplets. If everyone wore a mask then asymptomatic people would spread less particles than just breathing all over the place with nothing on. No we haven’t seen a significant decrease because of all the reasons mentioned above, because people aren’t doing their part, because they aren’t wearing masks, shields, not washing there hands like they should, won’t quit touching their faces. </p>
<p>See you refuse, you’re unwilling. I’m not isolated? Why is that such a thing for you, I haven’t lost hardly anything, oh boohoo I can’t watch a movie in theaters, that’s no problem, I can’t eat at restaurants, no big deal to me. I miss out on physical contact but I’m strong enough to go without. I can go without, you are saying you can’t.  I’m not staying sheltered indefinitely, it’s not like I’m locked up in my house shaking in my boots. I garden, I read, I tend to my animals, I go on drives, I hike by myself, I woodwork. Seriously the only thing I’m missing currently is the ability to kiss my boyfriend, and we are both totally saddened by it and absolutely 100% willing to wait it out because his parents have heart issues and I have a father that’s immunocompromised. We love each other enough and our relationship is strong enough that we don’t have to touch right now, we can go without for now, we know how to have intimate moments through words and work. In spending time together while social distancing and masked up, we garden together, we have fires, we watch the stars. </p>
<p>I feel sorry for you. That you know so little true happiness that you have to maintain a death grip onto the superficial aspects of life to feel content. I think it’s really sad that you might injure or kill someone because ‘you refuse’ to do simple things. You sound spoiled, you get what you want when you want despite it harming others. </p>
<p>You don’t understand, I’d let you life your life without a word to you if you weren’t willing to steal others lives, their working bodies, their family members. To me you’re a murderer by neglect. You don’t mind if you kill someone as long as you get to keep your creature comforts and don’t have to know you killed someone. You’re a coward.</p>

        <p>First article links to a study that says this </p>
<p>Although no randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the use
of masks as source control for SARS-CoV-2 has been pub-
lished, a number of studies have attempted to indirectly esti-
mate the efficacy of masks. Overall, an evidence review (29)
finds "moderate certainty evidence shows that the use of hand-
washing plus masks probably reduces the spread of respiratory
viruses."</p>
<p>Moderate certainty that mask wearing and hand washing probably reduces spread lol, wow</p>
<p>CDC says this:</p>
<p>"Masks may slow the spread of the virus"
 With no data to support.</p>
<p>Then, your final link  says this:</p>
<p>"If you’re healthy, a mask can help keep respiratory droplets from someone who is sick from landing in your nose and mouth"</p>
<p>Ooh so in case a sick person coughs in my face the mask may catch a couple droplets, wow so safe </p>
<p>Real great sources you got there, thats some wonderful "science".
The only reason I asked you for sources is because I knew there were no actual studies that proved mask wearing prevents the spread of coronavirus</p>

        <p>Just gonna skip over the part where your wife could die because you know you’re a sorry piece of shit not doing your part to protect her. Fuck you for marrying her without caring about her health. </p>
<p>It also says this, don’t put that out there like that’s the takeaway, you had to go searching for the one thing you think just dispels all I’ve said and it doesn’t. You literally CANT HANDLE being wrong. You’re selectively reading and only taking bits and pieces that fit you’re narrative. Gosh and trying to throw it back at me like that negates the rest of it. I’m done with this. You won’t learn, you just dismissed basically the entirety of of it. Read the others then instead of only trying to find the only hole you think you can poke into it, they echo the same message. </p>
<p>As states reopen from stay-at-home orders, many, including California, are now requiring people to wear face coverings in most public spaces to reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization now recommend cloth masks for the general public, but earlier in the pandemic, both organizations recommended just the opposite. These shifting guidelines may have sowed confusion among the public about the utility of masks.</p>
<p>But health experts say the evidence is clear that masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and that the more people wearing masks, the better.</p>
<p>We talked to UC San Francisco epidemiologist George Rutherford, MD, and infectious disease specialist Peter Chin-Hong, MD, about the CDC’s reversal on mask-wearing, the current science on how masks work, and what to consider when choosing a mask.</p>
<p>Why did the CDC change its guidance on wearing masks?</p>
<p>The original CDC guidance partly was based on what was thought to be low disease prevalence earlier in the pandemic, said Chin-Hong.</p>
<p>“So, of course, you’re preaching that the juice isn’t really worth the squeeze to have the whole population wear masks in the beginning – but that was really a reflection of not having enough testing, anyway,” he said. “We were getting a false sense of security.”</p>
<p>Rutherford was more blunt. The legitimate concern that the limited supply of surgical masks and N95 respirators should be saved for health care workers should not have prevented more nuanced messaging about the benefits of masking. “We should have told people to wear cloth masks right off the bat,” he said.</p>
<p>Another factor “is that culturally, the U.S. wasn’t really prepared to wear masks,” unlike some countries in Asia where the practice is more common, said Chin-Hong. Even now, some Americans are choosing to ignore CDC guidance and local mandates on masks, a hesitation that Chin-Hong says is “foolhardy.”</p>
<p>What may have finally convinced the CDC to change its guidance in favor of masks were rising disease prevalence and a clearer understanding that both pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission are possible – even common. Studies have found that viral load peaks in the days before symptoms begin and that speaking is enough to expel virus-carrying droplets.</p>

        <p>Here’s more since you didn’t actually read them all the first time. </p>
<p>Though wearing a mask is one of the most important things you can do to prevent coronavirus infection, there are still many misunderstandings about:
How safe and effective masks are
How to use them properly
When and where masks are needed
Discover the facts behind the myths about coronavirus masks.
Mask Safety and Effectiveness
Myth: Cloth masks don't protect you.
Fact: Cloth face masks are effective. They create a barrier between your mouth and nose and those around you. This makes it more difficult for the droplets that spread coronavirus through coughs, sneezes and talking to reach other people.
Cloth masks mainly keep you from unknowingly spreading the disease to others, but some studies indicate that they may help protect you from large droplets and serve as an indirect reminder to avoid touching your face.
This is why wearing a cloth mask inside all retail stores and public transportation has been mandatory in Maryland since April 2020. And as more services such as getting a haircut or eating in a restaurant are being allowed, it is as important as ever to continue wearing a mask. We're all in this together.
Myth: Other masks are more effective than cloth masks.
Fact: Different types of masks serve different purposes, but cloth masks are highly effective for the general public. The average person who is not working in a medical environment with COVID-19 patients should wear a cloth mask to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical workers.
Myth: Masks can cause carbon dioxide (CO2) build-up.
Fact: Some people have suggested that carbon dioxide from exhaling gets trapped under the cloth and can make you sick. This isn't true. Properly fitted masks offer adequate airflow while still covering your nose and mouth. This makes the accumulation of carbon dioxide impossible.
However, people with breathing problems, children under age 2, and those who can't remove the mask without assistance should not wear one.
How to Wear Masks
Myth: The way you wear a mask is not important.
Fact: Wearing a mask correctly is the key to making it effective at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. According to the CDC, a cloth face mask needs to have the following in order to be effective:
Cover both your nose and mouth
Fit snugly but comfortably against the sides of the face
Be secured with ties or ear loops
Have multiple layers of fabric
Allow for unrestricted breathing
Able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or shape changes
Where and When to Wear a Mask
Myth: You only need to wear a mask if you feel sick.
Fact: According to the CDC, studies suggest that many people who have coronavirus are asymptomatic, meaning they show no symptoms. You may have the disease and unknowingly spread it to others, including those with underlying conditions who have a higher coronavirus risk and are more vulnerable to severe illness. Asymptomatic carriers can increase the disease's spread if they aren't taking proper precautions, including wearing a mask, washing their hands frequently and social distancing.
Myth: If you're home, you don't need to wear a mask.
Fact: In most cases, this is true. However, if you do feel sick, have mild symptoms, and live with others, it's important to wear a mask to protect them.
Do not leave your home. Try to isolate yourself from healthy people you live with. Be sure to wear a mask if you leave your quarantine room or if they enter the room you're quarantining in.
Myth: If you've had coronavirus, you don't need a mask.
Fact: If you've had a coronavirus before or had an antibody test come up positive, you may believe that you don't need to wear a mask. Unfortunately, at this time, there is no way to know whether having coronavirus once provides immunity from the virus again or how long that your immunity might last. This means that you could potentially catch the disease again and spread it to others.
Everyone should wear a cloth mask when in public unless they have breathing problems, are under age two, or can't remove the mask without assistance.
Myth: You don't need to wear a mask outside.
Fact: At this time, being outside is generally considered safer than being inside. When taking a stroll or participating in other outdoor activities by yourself or with people you live with, a mask isn't required.
However, when you find it difficult to maintain at least six feet of distance from people you don't live with – such as exercising on a sidewalk or eating out at a restaurant – it's important to have your mask on. You should always have your mask on hand when you leave your home.</p>

        <p>I’m a home body and a germaphobe, I wear masks out during flu season because I have an immunocompromised father and can’t bear the thought of losing him due to my own negligence and bringing it back to him. If you want to try to justify your lack of mask use now because of past lack of use this is really an argument I can’t win. You don’t get any points for trying to stick me with something what..? Will be so damaging, you seriously think even if I hadn’t done my part then that that somehow excuses me from doing my part now. What are you on.</p>

        <p>Bullshit. On all counts. Everyone claims they know someone with a bad immune system, it's the 2020 version of I have anxiety or ADHD. Even the most decrepit old fuck has a better chance of surviving than dying. 
With how you are, maybe a therapist would be good for you. Of course you have nothing to lose by staying home. Doesn't mean you have to drag us down with you.</p>

        <p>it is important to remember, that we are not in a sprint, but in a marathon.</p>
<p>the demonstration in berlin on the 1.august 2020 was part of the marathon.</p>
<p>the bigger demonstrations even, that again happened in berlin on the 29. august 2020 and also in london and other places were also part of the marathon.</p>
<p>so the anti mask day is part of the marathon.</p>
<p>remember, that every bit helps, every bit to bring awareness, courage and freedom to the mind of people helps.</p>
<p>so the no mask day tomorrow is part of a bigger war for freedom.</p>
<p>i am saying this,  because some people might wrongfully think, that once we do x, we will suddenly be free again.</p>
<p>this is unlikely and can lead to lots of sadness, when x gets done, but there is still tons of fascism outside.</p>
<p>so remember to see tomorrow as part of the bigger fight for freedom and just do the best you can. don't wear a slave muzzle tomorrow. (i have never worn one myself thus far)</p>
<p>give your fliers,  go into public and into shops without a slave muzzle. go as a group preferably. hug people in public with their consent, or hug your friends in public, showing others, that yes  physical consenting contact between humans is ok and healthy, etc... etc...</p>

        <p>For 3 weekends in a row leading up till labor day, I invited friends over, and I was very clear.... no masks allowed. Each weekend I had ~10-15 friends over, we drank, swam in our pool, and enjoyed each others company. We hugged, shook hands, and had a good time. The first weekend every one was timid, as you could tell everyone was still hesitant about not social distancing. </p>
<p>By labor day weekend, none of my friends gave two shits. We even had my sister in law's boyfriend over who had covid about a month prior. He was hardly sick, and wouldn't have known if his job didn't force him to test. Surprise no outbreaks of covid, although my wife and I did get some sort of mild cold with a sorethroat, and my Lymph nodes swollen for a day. My wife had a headache, and we had a runny nose, but no fever. But that only lasted ~2 days. I find it so ironic we are so worried about the CoronaVirus but the first sickness we get is from something else LOL.</p>
