        <p>This is the best explanation I've seen about how people around us seem to have been body-snatched and brainwashed into the "new normal".</p>
<p>It's got some new terms in it but if you hang in there all the words get explained. It's helping clear up a lot of my questions about how otherwise sane people can believe such ridiculous and contradictory stuff right now.</p>
<p>Also here's a link to the full book (which I admit I haven't read yet) <a href="https://www.survivorshandbook.com/wp-content/articles/political-ponerology.pdf">Political Ponerology</a></p>
<p>*Does this make sense of some of the craziness?</p>

        <p>It was always there. This evil was always in these people. </p>
<p>What's the old saying. The greatest trick the devil (evil) ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. </p>
<p>People crave totalitarianism. To be told what to do, how to live, what to buy, etc. They love being on the side of totalitarianism. They're always for it until it falls apart. And it always does. They talk up loving being a 'free' people, being able to decide things for themselves. The truth is personal choice scares the hell out of them. Personal responsibility. Rather than face that it's easier to blame all the conceived ills of the world and your perceived slights on a scape goat group of people. And it's always the group that can think for themselves. That questions things. They're always made to be the enemy. </p>
<p>Every version of every tyrannical society to exist in history had the majority of it's people behind it. That feeling of superiority. To be the 'perfect' society. The greatest horrors in human history have been committed in the name of obtaining a perfect society at the expense of one group or the other.</p>
<p>All fell. All will always fall. History proves it. But these monsters are going to take all of us down with them on the way there.</p>

        <p>No they're not going to take all of us down.</p>
<p>The video and book talk about some mechanisms evil has used to achieve the kind of trance that a lot of good people seem to have been in this year. I don't agree that people crave totalitarianism and I don't agree that people are "for" totalitarianism when they understand what it is and what it demands.  </p>
<p>Rather it seems to me that many times good people are misled by evil ones.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on the specific mechanisms evil uses to mislead the good which are discussed in the book or the video? I'd love to hear them if so.</p>
