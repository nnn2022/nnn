        <p>CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said recent studies had shown that those vaccinated individuals who do become infected with Covid have just as much viral load as the unvaccinated, making it possible for them to spread the virus to others.</p>
<p>Administration officials still contend that the fully vaccinated represent a very small percentage of transmission, which is primarily occurring among unvaccinated people. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1275012</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's pretty safe to say the vaccines have been a disappointment. Icelanders refuse to accept that though and claim that if not for the vaccines it would have been way worse. They are begging for the booster shot. </p>
<p>90% of the Icelandic nation seem to be doomers. Despite Iceland only having 30 covid deaths (mostly 80+ year old) they still seem to think they are fighting the plague. </p>
<p>They have however avoided big waves until now but that just means (with the vaccines clearly not protective) that Iceland has next to no herd immunity. This winter is gonna be tough on the Icelandic health care system. Like everyone else, they have only focused on keeping cases down. Some even wanting a zero covid policy. There have been no extra measures to improve the health care and increase ICU beds but Iceland has one of the fewest ICU beds per capita in Europe. Heading for a disastrous winter I am afraid. The lives saved last winter will most likely be lost this winter instead. </p>
<p>If the vaccines really turn out to be a flop, as it seems like now, the head of infectious disease control/chief epidemilogist should definately resign. I don't envy his position and I really believe he is doing his best but aiming all the efforts towards a vaccine that no one has any idea if it works or not is a catastrophe.</p>

        <p>No amount of evidence is good enough. We need more cloth to stop the spread.</p>
