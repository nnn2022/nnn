    <strong>Anyone hates when they change to narrative just to put fear into people?</strong>
    <p><p>Have you all realized back when the vaccine started being administered how elder people died form Covid and how they needed to take the vaccine and the media was all over the topic, yet nobody said a single damn word about younger people needing it? Now that elder people took vaccine the media and politicians suddenly changed the narrative, and they're saying that younger people are dying from covid, and they must take the vaccine, and it became funeral silent about elder people dying. Newspaper headlines everyday say how this 30yo man died from covid because he was unvaccinated or how this 23yo woman died because she was unvaccinated (just examples how it's written in the newspaper not actual cases) meanwhile there is not a single beep about elder people dying. At the very least, it's good to see that most young people do not buy this fearmongering propaganda and refuse to take this experimental vaccine. What the media and politicians are doing with spinning the covid narrative to their liking is simply disgusting and pathetic, and it needs to stop. The truth is slowly coming out anyway, They need to stop with fearmongering and lies.</p></p>

        <p>They're trying to emotionally manipulate everyone, bit by bit. At first it was the elderly, then POC, now we are down to the young and "healthy" orphaning their children and even the young themselves, which interestingly were all in the group that suffered heart problems from the shot.</p>
