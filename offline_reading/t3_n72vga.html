    <strong>Hi all, just wanted to shout out a new sub I made</strong>
    <p><p>r/VaccineProposal</p>
<p>It's for people that, regardless on your take of the vaccine and it's related issues, disagree with it on the fundamental basis that it is authoritarian to implement a vaccine.</p>
<p>The proposal is simple: until the idea of a Vaccine Passport is culturally, socially, and politically nullified, we will not even consider taking the covid-19 vaccine on the grounds that a vaccine passport is against the Canadian charter of rights and freedoms, the American constitution, a whole host of other established rights, and human rights as a whole. </p>
<p>It's a place for anti-authoritarianism, so there won't be any room for Covid conspiracies unless they directly relate to authoritarian measures and seem valid. I'm going to try to keep an arms distance from the anti-vax crowd just to keep the sub and its cause less controversial.</p></p>
