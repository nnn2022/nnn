        <p>Nope.  We have a very small circle of friends and we are all in the same socioeconomic group.  Shamelessly said, we are all above average financially.  We do have some friends which are lower wage earners and the differences between the two groups is staggering.  I made a post about this earlier today but I'll say it again.  I've noticed that the people most scared are typical cubicle workers.  Executives and manual labor workers seem to not be as concerned.  Obviously this isn't true for all, it just seems to be the average.</p>
<p>That said, almost all of our friends just kind of never changed anything.  We don't wear masks, we still go eat (we put the mask on for the walk to the table because I do believe in private businesses getting to set their own rules) but overall, nothing much changed.  My wife and I already had it, neither of us even knew it at the time.  I suspect this is the case with a lot of people who aren't being counted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile our friends in the lower wage group have locked themselves in their house to the point where one of them is completely broke, they are sterilizing their groceries, etc... this has completely disrupted their lives. That is a lot of work with no real benefit.  Terrible risk assessment and management.</p>

        <p>The higher level workers are smarter (hence making it to the top) so they know it’s Bs. the manual laborers have never been able to work remote and know it’s not an option so they continue. It’s the dumber grunts that can work remote that are driving this.</p>

        <p>I'll tell you one side effect to this whole thing I really hate.  I can't stand the fact that my waiter/waitress has to wear a mask while I don't.  I feel like it's almost humiliating for them.  I know they'd get in trouble if they took it off so I never say anything to make anyone uncomfortable but I've been tipping a lot more graciously.  I know it's not much when it comes to some lost dignity but it's what I can do.  Nobody deserves that.</p>

        <p>Right - most of my friends and family aren't worried but there are a few and they're not being consistent with their actions.</p>

        <p>You just wrote:</p>
<p>"I spent a long time with close friends and even go to stores without a mask on!! I know I know.....shocker right?!"</p>
<p>The actions of your relatives are comprehensible considering, by your own admission, that you constantly put yourself in situations that increase the probability of contagion and, therefore, of transmission of the disease.</p>

        <p>There's zero evidence that masks control the spread.<br>
There are accounts of people wearing masks and still contracting the virus.</p>
<p>No masks are NOT a "better than nothing" option.  In fact there's evidence showing that due to the frequent touching and concentration around the masks that wearing a mask increases the risks that someone will get infected.</p>
