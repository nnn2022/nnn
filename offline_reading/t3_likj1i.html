    <strong>Mini rant about doomer coworker going after disabled people about masks.</strong>
    <p><p>I work at a bank in Minnesota. We as employees need to wear masks. Whatever. We’re all pretty anti mask in our home lives. Save for one person who is a doomer hands down. </p>
<p>In Minnesota the mask mandate has been in place since either June or July of last year. However there are medical exemptions for mask wearing. </p>
<p>With that being said. A deaf man walked into the bank without a mask. Our dear doomer singled him out and made him leave AFTER he told her very clearly that he was dead and masks make it so he cannot communicate. I’m beyond angry. For her claiming to be someone so inclusive and accepting, she sure isn’t accepting of anyone with a disability not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>Hell. I’ve even seen her freak out on a guy who literally did not have hands about wearing a mask. This is not okay. And I know ranting here doesn’t accomplish anything. But it gets it off my chest so I don’t explode.</p></p>

        <p>My daughter has a medical exemption. In minnesota, the human rights advocacy group states that it is discrimination ... Unless we are in the middle of a pandemic. My question was so ... A pandemic erases the right to inclusivity? 
They didn't like that question but continued to tell me that being forced to leave or not provided service because of not wearing a mask isn't discrimination. 
Yesterday, Perkins told us we had to sit in a separate room because my daughter can't wear a mask. Even though everyone was eating and not wearing masks. Whatever ... We got a quiet room to eat in. I wanted to ask if they were separating diners by race, in addition to medical condition. But decided to keep my smartass comments to myself.</p>

        <p>how the fuck does being deaf mean he can't communicate without a mask. </p>
<p>Fuck masks and everything about them but this is the dumbest shit ever. Ok maybe the other person shouldn't use a mask so he can lip read, what the fuck does that have to do with him wearing a mask. Unless he's using it as a blindfold.</p>
