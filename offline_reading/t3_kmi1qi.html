    <strong>I am going to kill myself</strong>
    <p><p>Hello.</p>
<p>I think this world isn't for me at all and death is all I can think of for months now. As things are just going to get worse, even long-term, why should I even bother living? I have lost all fear of death, whilst everyone else is scared.</p>
<p>So far, lock-down has destroyed everything for me. No, not Covid, which has the same fatality rate as flu (99.97%). Lock-downs and this "new normal". The first month or two I didn't care, but things are getting worse by the day, and people are becoming more passive and compliant. Why is there just silence? Everything is censored or deleted on the internet, this is the only place I see criticism, which will probably soon be banned anyway for going against the narrative.</p>
<p>It's destroyed my local area, socially and economically. Everywhere is empty, apart from large supermarkets, it's like a nuclear bomb has dropped. Small businesses destroyed, but their owners just go along with it, why don't they care? They used to care about the most minor of things... Why do staff at my work argue and analyze minuscule things of no importance, yet don't even question all of their freedoms and human rights being taken away?</p>
<p>My friends refuse to see me or leave the house anymore, even though they're all young and healthy.</p>
<p>I cannot connect to anyone, or meet new people, they jump out the way if I walk too near them on the street. Hood up, masks on, head down. Zombies.</p>
<p>I'm forced to go to work, surrounded by hundreds of people from all over the world, but I can't see my own family. Why am I even working, just so I can pay the social security money of fat ugly cunts so they can watch Netflix and tell everyone to "Stay. The. Fuck. Home"?</p>
<p>I am glared at  everywhere I go for not wearing a disgusting rag over my face. It's difficult to breathe and for me to see with one on. I can't properly hear the mumbles of what the NPCs are saying anyway. The hatred in everyone's eyes is like out of a horror movie. In fact yesterday, some women who looked like Jabba the Hut came up to me and started angrily and patronizingly shouting at me because my rag slipped below my nose. I had to laugh, since when did someone of her size care about health?</p>
<p>And people just want more... Saying "we need a harsher lock-down", implying everything should be shut down forever? Browse reddit in incognito mode and all you can see is propaganda, with tens of 
thousands of up-votes and awards on the front page for shaming people doing what were once normal human things. Weird for a website that traditionally, had a user-base of people obsessed with privacy and freedom.</p>
<p>The media spews out garbage all day long. What happened to libel, basic facts, statistics? They just say whatever they want to push an agenda and everyone blindly accepts it.</p>
<p>I cannot even escape from Australia, because it's the same bullshit everywhere, and I'm not allowed to travel.</p>
<p>The person reading this, are you alive or am I in some kind of zombie apocalypse? All I see is a cold, dark, sterile world, devoid of any human connection. No humor, that's all racist and offensive. There is no end in sight, restrictions just get harsher. Do people have a fetish for poverty or being screwed by the Government?</p>
<p>Fuck this world and fuck everyone, I'm done, I have already bought rope and will be found hanging from a tree.</p></p>

        <p>Please don't do it. I feel the same way sometimes, but what keeps me going is that I'm stubborn. If people who question the establishment are all gone, then they win and get the "new normal" they want. I still have a sliver of hope left that things will get better, I'm seeing more people question the propaganda everyday. Don't give up please!</p>

        <p>I feel exactly like you, I do. The thing is there is a ton of people that think the way we do. Their comments are constantly deleted because of the amount of downvotes from the leeches sitting at home all day with nothing to do other than censor people that use critical thinking. The thing is this can’t go on forever, people are getting sick of it. They will buck back against the “mandates” and not conform to this facade. They already are. You are not alone.</p>

        <p>There is backlash. There wouldn't be censorship and algorithms out the arse if there wasn't. People are just becoming hopeless. If they saw someone who wanted to give in but didn't, they'd have a reason to hope. This is why I recommended spite. People making destructive decisions don't care if you die. They only care if you live, and it affects them.</p>

        <p>The difference is the “woke” crowd is impulsive. They eat up everything they’re told, even if it isn’t logical. They’re breaking point is far lower than ours, they don’t take the time to question a fucking thing or observe and make their own opinions. That means the backlash is coming, just later than theirs. It takes business owners being willing to be fined, people willing to be charged for not muzzling up, and a society that decides there is no freedom without risk. A risk that is over 99% in their favor.</p>

        <p>You can kill your self without actually killing your body. Experiment with some psilocybin mushrooms. 
Ego death is a very real death. </p>
<p>I believe and have witnessed, we are completely blocked off from our “selves”. The only times we connect with ourselves is within our dreams (we talk with our subconscious) but even then we forget them or they are very fragmented. </p>
<p>With psilocybin mushrooms in my experience, it’s like you get to really talk to yourself. That’s the only way I can describe it.</p>
<p>It’s like of course you have your inner monologue all day long in your head but those are mostly thoughts that you believe you should be thinking. Programming. I need to do this or that or buy this thing or that. </p>
<p>Mushrooms killed my ego. It felt like a part of me really died and I felt sad but at the same time i felt no more guilt. </p>
<p>It changed my perception of my existence. </p>
<p>I truly believe we are programmed to be a worker drone from a very young age and our thoughts aren’t our own most of the time.</p>
