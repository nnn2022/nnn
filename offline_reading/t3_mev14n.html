    <strong>Can someone explain the logic of the vaccine to me?</strong>
    <p><p>I understand older people getting it as well as those who are compromised or sick. Here’s the thing that throws me off.</p>
<p>If I’m young and healthy and get the vaccine I won’t show any symptoms of the virus. However, I’ve heard that you can still spread it even though you’ve been vaccinated. The only thing it does is stop your symptoms from showing.</p>
<p>Does this not render someone who is vaccinated with a high probability of survival more dangerous? Because now there are no symptoms that exhibit illness and you are selfishly wandering out in public not knowing who you could spread it to. In other words, you are spreading the virus the way they told us those who are asymptomatic were believed to.</p>
<p>If the virus cannot be transmitted after you’re vaccinated ignore this post. But if you’re a young person who has a high rate of survival and you get the vaccine just so you don’t show symptoms but still interact with the public who could catch it from you, how is that not the most selfish thing ever?</p></p>

        <p>its not logical. its political theater and a control thing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so the vaccine doesnt stop you from getting covid, doesnt stop you from spreading covid, what it does is it MAY help with "symptoms"... well wtf most ppl who get covid dont even get "symptoms" anyways lol. and those that do get "symptoms" are like a runny nose and cold.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>plus if the vaccine has such a high rate of side effects like high fever and other shit, thats even possibly worse than if you get covid symptoms anyways lol.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>whole thing is garbo. plus its only in emergency use authorization with no liability. so all the blood clots and unknown side effects are at ur own risk. LOL</p>

        <p>The logic of a vaccine for this virus goes like this:</p>
<p>If most people started getting better understanding of the nutritional requirements of their bodies, including a higher requirement when under various challenges such as heavy exercise or stress or an infection with a virus like this one or influenza etc, and they started diligently trying to get good healthy amounts of all those nutrients, every day, then there would be a significant reduction in the profit of pharmacutical corporations, their affiliates, and their stakeholders.</p>
<p>In addition to required nutrition, the human body is also well adapted to make beneficial use of many other products of nature.  For example, there's very many things that are shown to reduce excess proinflammatory cytokine production.</p>
<p>Eating nutrients is ordinary, for all life.  Vaccines are extraordinary.</p>
<p>Products of nature are not patentable, so there's FAR less profit potential compared to patentable synthetic molecules.</p>
<p>Their profit is dependant on as many people as possible being as unhealthy as possible, to maximize the purchase of their products.  Lack of proper nutrition can cause all sorts of health problems, from head to toe.  Pharmaceutical corporations have synthetic molecule products to "treat" some of those problems, and there's the whole matter of medical device manufacturers, and those that use a scalpel to get revenue.</p>
<p>Therefore: it's in their fiscal self-interests to get everybody to (continue to) believe that their body is incapable of dealing with this virus.  There's layers upon layers to accomplish this, such as getting people to believe that "cases" (which isn't really "cases" at all, but simply PCR+ results) matter, and that "transmission" matters, and that this is a "safety" issue rather than the health issue that it is.</p>
<p>Better still is to get their true believers to ALSO get the non-believers to participate in their belief system, maybe by coercion, or even force, or even subliminally suggesting, or by providing example of belief system behavior, or other means (such as using fallacies like poisoning the well, strawman arguments, appeal to authority, etc).</p>
<p>Also, the pharmacutical corporations and their affiliates and stakeholders can derive revenue from the vaccines, but the long con is the real game here.</p>

        <p>I've read that the vaccine <em>limits</em> severe illness, but in fact people are very much still symptomatic, and in fact still dying of covid after getting the vaccine. To say otherwise makes it seem like everyone should get the vaccine to avoid getting covid symptoms.</p>

        <p>Yes, my understanding is that they are claiming it is effective by basically saying you could be sick 6 days instead of 8, or that it will take you 5 days to die instead of 2.</p>

        <p>Doomers claim you can still spread it after you get vaccinated but they’re utter retards and have been this entire time so I wouldn’t believe a word they say.</p>
<p>A vaccine works by training your immune system to rapidly detect and kill the presence of a virus. The Covid vaccine is no different in this respect. It works by killing the virus early enough it isn’t able to replicate and cause symptoms. Your immune system would kill the virus before you were able to spread it.</p>
<p>There’s no reason why any vaccinated people should still have to wear masks.</p>

        <p>It is amazing how uneducated you are. Anti-parasitics are very commonly used to treat inflammation. Even people with rosacea commonly use it, even if only in a topical form.</p>
<p>Studies all over are showing how incredibly well ivermectin is working to combat covid. Even I know someone who's father had tested positive for covid. An older man, too. Within 2 days it was completely eradicated. $5 with insurance, perhaps $50 out of pocket.</p>
<p>You have absolutely zero idea what you're talking about and it scares me how confident you are but without anything to back it up.</p>
<p>This medicine has been around for 50+ years and it consistently proven over and over again to obliterate covid. But no, we need a vaccine.</p>

        <p>Well I know people that have taken it and they cleared up in a matter of days. Do they also say you should take the vaccine? Give me any medicine with 100% success and zero side effects.</p>

<p>Bro, that's called homeopathy and it's only 100% fake.  </p>
<p>That's why there are no side effects to watered down rosebuds.  xD</p>

        <p>Look up "Anecdote" and take your time to discover that they aren't scientifically valid as evidence.. especially in medical.</p>
<p>And yeah, I'm sure a drug did something.  That's why we make them.  That particular anti-parasite is used as an anti-inflammatory...so I'd bet it <em>did</em> work on inflammation.</p>
<p>Did it cure covid?</p>
<p>Fuck no. And anyone mentioning it as a cure for covid needs to have their mouths bolted shut for the safety and well-being of others.</p>
<p>This sub is an echo chamber for dangerously misinformed people who are very sure they know better than educated doctors and scientists.</p>
<p>This plague could have been over last year, if it weren't for people who are so absolutely incompetent.  Selfish morons are the reason this has lasted so long.</p>
<p>If the members of this sub and people who think like them, are the ones continuing the spread of this.  They are so stupid, they are a global health hazard.</p>

        <p>There is absolutely no logic to it. Doomers are brainwashed and will give you either the: "iT LeSsEns ThE SyMptOmS" or "tHe vaCcIne mAkeS YoU SiCk but CoVId wOuld bE wOOOOoorse" arguments and nothing more. 
Personally I haven't even gotten a cold since 2019 much less COVID so there is absolutely no need for me to get a leaky vaccine. I'm trusting my immune system on this one.</p>
