    <strong>Words mean things.</strong>
    <p><p>While I understand that language evolves over time to some degree, we can't allow one side to conveniently change the definition of words to better meet their narrative.  Also, words made from combinations of other words shouldn't stray from their underlying definitions...especially after being in use for decades. </p>
<p>In the past, words meant things.  Common usage was referred to as slang until it had been used for a number of years in formal writing.  Definitions rarely changed -- thereby allowing fluid conversion between different generations of people.  </p>
<p>The most recent example that comes to mind is the term "antivaxxer" that has been changed to encompass people who are against laws mandating vaccination.  This new slang usage has already been officially recognized in under a year of use by Miram Webster and others. </p>
<p>Another, unrelated to covid-19, is electrocuted.  The etymology is well documented.  The root words mean executed by means of electricity.  We already have a word (shocked) for non-lethal electrical discharge.  This changed in the last decade at some point. </p>
<p>This is pure insanity.  We need a "words mean things" movement to ensure that people are able to hold meaningful conversations and debates.  We also need our dictionaries to track definition changes over recent history.  If a definition has changed significantly in the last decade, include the previous definition as well as the date the change was incorporated into the dictionary.</p>
<p>This "new normal" is going to be a huge problem if we don't get ahead of it.</p></p>

        <p>Excellent post</p>
<p>You are 100% on point. They are very good at using manipulative language, that will always appeal to people emotions rather than logic. </p>
<p>I think the ‚Äúold normal‚Äù was already a huge problem in this regard and it‚Äôs only getting worse by the day. </p>
<p>I think one of the biggest misused terms being thrown around today is the word ‚ÄúExpert‚Äù.
Just because you do something for a living does not make you an expert in your field. You are not free from mistakes, manipulating, misrepresenting, outright lying. Just look at any profession. Take teaching for example. They are supposed to be experts at disseminating knowledge. A lot of them are some of the dumbest people I‚Äôve ever met. I work in construction and some of these tradesmen have been doing this their entire lives and fuck things up on every single job lol</p>

        <p>I love your post, but the title made me laugh. Obviously I get what you are saying, and I completely agree with all of it, but I couldn‚Äôt help but think ‚Äúno shit‚Äù when I read that üòÇ</p>

        <p>This is something I would like to bring light to as well. Im thinking about putting something together.</p>
<p>Martian Webster also used to have a day counter that showed when the changes were made (days ago), but they have removed that as well. </p>
<p>I feel given the current political topics, including big tech censorship, this should fall inline. Anyone know of a way to get this historical data from Martian Webster?</p>
