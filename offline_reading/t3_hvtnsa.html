        <p>I usually get excited around this time of year, anticipating the fall and winter. But now I am dreading it. I feel like August and September are going to be pivotal. They will <strong>try</strong> to push for more lockdowns by then, possibly even a national one again. CA already got another lockdown, and I see this as the "test run". Judging by the fact there hasn't been too much pushback against it, I think they will now push for another one, and I think the next national lockdown for the US, if there is one, will be longer, and much more stricter.</p>

        <p>I suspect you might be right, but when I think of fall and winter, something about that thought feels healing, like something will change for the best and start washing all of this misery away.  Maybe it just helps me when I can't sleep at night, but I think whatever helps.</p>

        <p>I...don't want to be right. Fall and winter are sacred to me. I want this to just be a memory, and to move on with my life. But...they are pushing more lockdowns <strong>very</strong> hard, another one of their experts is highly recommending a, you guessed it, longer and stricter lockdown (it's in the frontpage of LDS right now).</p>

        <p>I know.  I love fall.  I was born in early fall.  It is my happiest time of year and my favorite season.  I look forward to it about this time every year.  I quiet my feelings of restlessness by thinking about it.  And I hope that I am right, that there is something about it that will be healing.  I might just have to find that for myself though.</p>

        <p>So I finished the article now, and this is the ending for it:</p>
<p>&rt; Where we go from here is anyone’s guess. My hunch is, it is only going to get worse until they can get Trump out of office, which Americans are liable to help them do, simply to make the whole nightmare stop.</p>
<p>&rt; Once he’s gone, they’ll probably retire the fake pandemic, call off the riots, and stage some sort of international celebration of the Rebirth of Democracy, after which they can get finally back to the business of ruthlessly destabilizing, restructuring, and privatizing the planet, sanitizing history, curing humanity of racism, hate, and other pathologies, and otherwise enforcing rigid conformity to global capitalist ideology.</p>
<p>&rt; Maybe they could get the Hamilton composer to write them a hip hop Deutschlandlied to use as a supranational anthem. They could call it GloboCap Über Alles … it kind of has a ring to it, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to assume this will happen. I won't deny this is a likely outcome. Maybe. I guess here are my theories on the election outcomes...</p>
<p>Trump loses, Biden wins #1: As described in this article. Everything goes away. Gradually, they will declare COVID defeated. I still see the vaccine happening, and probably being mandated though. </p>
<p>Trump loses, Biden wins #2: The authoritarianism continues. Biden has said he plans to mandate masks when elected, and he might stick to his word. Masks will become permanent, at least during his reign in office. He and the Dems see how thirsty for totalitarianism the populace is, and they give the people what they want.</p>
<p>Neutral (it doesn't matter who wins): As some government documents suggest, the virus still continues to plague the US and maybe the world into 2021 or 2022. Restrictions continue because the outcome was either already planned or predicted to go on until this time.</p>
<p>Trump wins, Biden loses #1: Trump goes hard against places that don't re-open at this point, and most places will go back to normal in early 2021. Vaccine is mandated or optional, depending on factors. </p>
<p>Trump wins, Biden loses #2: Some red states will resume normalcy, while other red ones and most/all blue ones will retain restrictions and a "New Normal". Nation is splintered due to this.</p>
<p>Trump wins, Biden loses #3: Things continue as they were. This is similar to the neutral outcome, except Trump himself will push harder for the "New Normal", and make claims that matters are worsening, and push for more restrictions, and mandates like the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I honestly see "Trump Loses, Biden wins #2" and "Trump Wins, Biden loses #2" being the most likely. I don't see us ever going back to normal anytime soon, tbh. I've lost hope in the people</p>

        <p>In my very personal opinion, I see "Trump wins, Biden loses #2" as the most likely outcome. Trump wins the election again. The country is splintered as a result. Places like Pennsylvania and New Jersey will remain in "New Normal" status indefinitely, while states like South Dakota and Georgia will be more "old normal". As for the vaccine, I think Trump will "leave it up to individual states", and as you may guess, the blue ones will make them mandatory for participation in everyday life, and whatever. There's still a chance of a national mandate, too, or that many companies will mandate digital proof or whatever for participation in society.</p>

        <p>Yes, I agree. It's extremely sad though, I've always wanted to travel to every state in the US one day when I get older, but that dream is dead. Sigh. Well, at least there are still free states left in this shit country, we can go there and the doomers can have the authoritarian states, haha. Jokes aside though, the future for this country terrifies me. Turns out most people will happily trade their freedoms just for the illusion of being safe. Since that's the case, this isn't the last time we'll see something like this.</p>

        <p>My worry is the prospects of Civil War or of even more division amongst the country. Travel will be dead, too, yes. I can almost see those blue states like NJ, NY, CT just keeping their "two week mandatory quarantine" lists alive indefinitely as well.</p>

        <p>Civil War is highly likely, and so is division (that's sorta already happening though). Masks are already creating a HUGE division between us as a society, and the vaccine will make it 1000× worse. Now you must take the vaccine to participate in society, and if you don't, you're a selfish killer outcast. I already see it now...must show proof of vaccination, or no shirt, no vaccination, no service or whatever kind of ridiculous bullshit they'll come up with. This might just split up the country if things get really serious, the north will be indefinitely be in the "new normal" while the south will be the "old normal". This sounds absolutely insane but with everything that's been happening now, I sadly won't be surprised...</p>

        <p>Not sure if I would divide by north and south because there's places up north like the Dakotas that are against the "New Normal" for the most part, and places south like Texas and Florida, and Virginia, that are dabbling in the "New Normal". It will be due to politics, and other factors, I'd say. Some states may even be mixed.</p>

        <p>Civil war is not a real possibility, though the media may frame it as that. The military is so powerful it will roll over any opposition, so a military police state would quickly evolve in any combination of red/blue states.</p>

        <p>Very interesting write up! I agree that Trump wins, Biden loses #2 is the one most likely to happen. There's already been a huge build up for the country being divided. Yes, BLM, the organization, not the statement itself, is for dismantling the American way of life. They are a Marxist group and the obedience of the populace with regards to the lockdowns and masks is in line with their agenda. Keep the sheep in their pen while the wolf gets ready to attack.</p>

        <p>Not sure if I'd write this up as its own post. My opinions are <strong>not</strong> popular around these parts, and also, last time I discussed this, people got pretty angry at the idea of this continuing on into 2021 if Biden won.</p>

        <p>We've been posting together for awhile, even back on LDS. At first, I thought this was going to be short lived and never really agreed with you (that this truly is a new normal). It's gone on far too long and I think more people, especially here, would be ok with your opinions.</p>

<p>Heh, no. People do not seem okay with my "doomer" attitude here. I've been getting many more downvotes, insults, and pushback in this sub lately.</p>
<p>&rt; You seem to have a good head on your shoulders and don't be afraid to show it.</p>
<p>Thanks, I guess. Just not feeling very happy or confident in myself lately.</p>

        <p>That's <em>the</em> most optimistic outcome, and I'm not sure of the likeliness of it happening. I'd give it...25% chance, compared to the other Trump win options.</p>
