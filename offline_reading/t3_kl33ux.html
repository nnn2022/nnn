    <strong>The "Mask-Up America" campaign has been a complete failure.</strong>
    <p><p>So there are so many problems here. First of all, <strong>there's no minimum standard for what is (or what is not) a mask.</strong> In fact, they don't even call it a mask. They just say "face covering." That could be anything from a medical-grade mask down to a scarf. </p>
<p><strong>There has been zero training or instruction.</strong> It's just "wear a face covering." The vast majority of people have no idea what they're doing. They wear the same mask, day in and day out. The put it on, take it off, put it back on again. Stuff it in a pocket or purse. Pull it down to eat/drink, put it back up again. Hang it from their rearview mirror. This left "sanitary" in the rearview mirror 40 miles back. </p>
<p>In addition, all of <strong>that is forcing them to get their hands up on and around their face way more often.</strong> Any doctor will tell you that's a prime way to catch something. </p>
<p><strong>Then there's the risk compensation.</strong> Our brains do us a big disservice here. When we're told something will keep us safe, we will often unconsciously engage in more risky behavior. They'll get in a car with someone who's coughing because they believe as long as everyone has on a mask, they're safe. We're being bombarded with this "mask up" message and yet, there has been no study that confirms that the average lay-person out in Wal-Mart with zero training wearing an improvised "face covering" is doing anything at all. For years the CDC said healthy people should not wear masks. Then that suddenly changed. Now if that had been accompanied with a proper, peer-reviewed study then I think there would be a lot less push back. But there wasn't. It's just "do was we say." </p>
<p><strong>Then there are the bizarre rules.</strong> You have to wear a mask to your table, but once you sit down you can take it off. Come on now. How does that make any sense whatsoever? It's like the kids game "The Floor is Lava." I realize they're trying to reach a compromise to keep restaurants open, but this is absurd. Nobody believes that you're safe sitting at your table, but in grave danger walking to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>The inevitable comparison to hospital staff wearing masks.</strong> A mask in a hospital is ONE part of an overall infection control strategy. They buy disinfectant by the truckload. Scrubs, gowns, gloves, head coverings, eye coverings, booties, and the mask. They also all come with very strict training and discipline. All of this works in concert to more-or-less control infections in a hospital. To pluck one tiny aspect out of that strategy and throw it at the average untrained person in a completely uncontrolled environment and expect positive results is far fetched, at best. 
The mask makes the average lay-person believe they're doing something. It gives them a feeling of having at least some control over this and that isn't nothing. I recognize that benefit. Contact tracing has shown that hundreds of people have contracted covid even though they wore a mask religiously. It's possible that even more would have contracted it without the mask but we just don't know. Again, there has been no proper study. All we have are "under controlled environments" or "in a hospital/lab setting" or "a study suggests."</p></p>

        <p>I don't believe they work either.  Why are people so convinced they do?  So many of my friend just SCREAM at me about how "The masks WORK!"  When I ask about the data they just start calling me names.</p>

        <p>Fact 1: There is no asymptomatic spread. Study of 10 million in Wuhan proved this - this makes masks pointless.</p>
<p>Fact 2: Danish study on masks and transmission in Covid infected populations concluded masks were worthless.</p>
<p>Fact 3: The only meta analysis of viral transmission from previous viral outbreaks concluded masks were useless.</p>
<p>Fact 4: It was universally agreed until the media decided otherwise that masks did not work back in February/March - the WHO has confirmed that the science did not change, to the BBC, but that the politics did.</p>
<p>Fact 5: The British government does not pretend otherwise either and has never changed its official stance that there is no evidence that masks work, either.</p>
<p>Fact 6: The CDC admits the virus is airborne - this means aerosols and thus, masks are worthless.</p>
<p>It's not a question of belief. Masks don't work. And this is really important because they are dehumanizing and they keep people afraid - they were mandated to help reduce fear but, in reality, they are a constant symbol to those in terror of the common cold that "something deadly is among us".</p>

        <p>I think a lot of it is desperation on the part of state governors.  They're all trying to one-up each other.  None want to be seen as the governor who "did nothing and that got people killed."</p>

        <p>I agree. And all of your points are 💯 spot-on. That’s how I’ve figured out I can convince my friends why they don’t work - almost nobody uses them correctly (no hygiene) and they put themselves in positions that are arguably less safe because of them.</p>

        <p>That's what concerns me the most.  The people that think they're safe with a mask.  I think they're taking risks they shouldn't and wouldn't be taking if they weren't convinced the mask was a solution.</p>
<p>I also think "getting your hands up around your face more often" is a very close second.  People are going out and touching all kinds of things in the stores and then constantly adjusting, removing, and replacing that mask.  I believe that's contributing to the spread.</p>
<p>All of that said, we just don't have any solid data.  There has been no study.</p>

        <p>Yep, these are all points Fauci made in the beginning. Although, me not trusting anything they say, it made me want to wear a mask more.  We didn't exactly know what we were dealing with at that time though. When it was clear that case &amp; death numbers were being manipulated, and masks became mandated, that's when I was like "fuck this shit". People say masks aren't a political issue. Anything that is mandated by government (or banned for that matter) automatically becomes a political issue, whether the justification is medical or otherwise.</p>

        <p>Well they can't very well now say they aren't effective.  They'll continue to push the mask mandate because they cannot admit they made a mistake.  Plus, the mask thing seems "safer."  I don't think it is and actually think it's making the problem worse.</p>

        <p>I didn't spend as much time around NBC protocols as some, but certainly more than most.  When it comes to biological weapons, or chemical weapons for that matter, it requires having a sealed mask with filter for chemical weapons and really a suit with positive pressure for bio weapons.  A paper napkin isn't going to do much and I've challenged anyone who believes otherwise to go stand in a CS chamber and tell me how well that paper mask worked.</p>

        <p>Well no, it most certainly isn't "nothing."  People in my own family have had Covid.  It's no joke.  A lot of people have died from it.  It isn't "nothing."</p>
<p>The problem we have here is government officials trying to set health policy.  They have no idea what they're doing.  They try something, and when that doesn't work they try MORE of the same things.  It's desperation.  They need to be able to say they "did something."  Now it doesn't matter if that "something" was totally useless.  That just doesn't matter.</p>

        <p>The most important thing to keep you safe which any COMPETENT person in healthcare will tell you is to wash your hands frequently and social distance. Masks are good to remind people to social distance but at this point if it hasn’t trained your brain to do that it’s not going to. If you touch your face constantly with your mask on that’s a huge hinderance. The virus is airborne and if it’s circulating inside the same room with tons of people and poor ventilation if someone has it you’re just as likely to get it with or with out a mask on. Also it does really lull people in to a false sense of security. People online seem to make it seem like you’re invulnerable if you don’t wear a mask. They constantly conflate things that don’t matter with the reason of why Covid isn’t “going away”. If you can breathe through a mask the virus can get through a mask. It might stop a giant sneeze of droplets but if you’re in the same room as someone who has it for multiple hours you’re getting that shit mask or not. So one last time I’ll say the most important thing is to wash your hands frequently and social distance. Masks may be a good subconscious psychological reminder for people but that’s basically it. They have their use but they aren’t the end all be all safety measure people think they are and if you think they are you’re fooling yourself. It might make you “feel” safer but that doesn’t mean it’s making you safer. Don’t be stupid be mindful if you live with much older people or people who are immunocompromised. If you’re young and healthy don’t live in fear. If you’re obese, very old, or have underlying conditions try to be as safe as possible and make your family members aware of this. Good luck with all this bullshit though and hopefully more Americans will wake up eventually.</p>
<p>P.S. hate to get conspiratorial at the end but I think the masks have become such an inflection point because it allows the politicians to blame the citizens instead of themselves by focusing on something that’s mostly useless and therefore not overall accepted and then say why won’t the people listening to our plan and a lot of people will by it due to the mask fear mongering, even though it seems like it’s a very small minority of people who are actively refusing to wear masks. As always the politicians are just protecting their own asses while they flaunt the rules</p>

        <p>There are no minimum standards? Apparently you haven't been on the CDC website recently. They clearly state which qualities of a mask to look for.</p>
<p>The mask up canpaign has been a failure because idiot plague rats refuse to wear one because they are scientifically illiterate and willfully uneducated.</p>

        <p>This is an argument that simply does not make sense.  The vast majority of people are wearing masks and yet, it has had no significant impact on the case rate whatsoever.  Do you really believe the tiny fraction of people not wearing masks are responsible for this?  How are you coming to this conclusion?</p>
<p>And if they're scientifically illiterate, then that suggests that you have some science to back up the claim that they are effective.  What do you have?</p>

        <p>Agreed.  I'm still looking for the data.  The research.  The proper study.  I've asked a lot of people about this and all I ever get are Facebook memes, screaming, or personal attacks as a response.</p>
<p>I honestly do not believe there is any study which shows a strong connection between the average, untrained lay-person wearing a "face covering" out in the wild and a reduction in viral infection transmission.</p>
<p>I think it's one of those things that sounds good on paper, everyone is doing it, so therefore it must be true.  The Discovery Channel had a series that ran for a decade on that kind of thinking.</p>

        <p>Lol. You don't understand how science works do you?</p>
<p>Which group of people is most at risk? Fat, old, and dying (2.6 or more comorbidities). </p>
<p>Have you ever been to South Korea? There are no fatties there. Only 4% of the country is obese.</p>
<p>The UK is 28%, USA is 42.4% and Canada I can't find a statistic for obesity alone but 60% of the country is overweight or obese compared to Korea's umm... 30% for that statistic.</p>
<p>It's not masks you dimwit. It's obesity that makes the difference.</p>
