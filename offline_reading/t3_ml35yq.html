    <strong>The problem I have with this sub</strong>
    <p><p>I started following this sub because I was sick of the lockdowns and blatant hypocrisy of those in power framing rules and restrictions, while those same people (and people who believe them ) openly breaking all those rules  while also virtue signalling to the rest of us.</p>
<p>I also had enough of how the entire covid situation went from being" about the science" to being about random lockdowns,night restrictions, no indoor dining, requirements to wear masks in some places while it's okay to be without mask in other places. </p>
<p>Basically, the lack of consistency in science based approach, the hypocrisy , and the sheer stupidity of everyone believing that they still need to be careful. </p>
<p>Even after 1 year of now learning enough of the virus. Knowing that it's not that dangerous for 99% of the population ( I had covid, and I was hospitalized for a week only because I had vulnerabilities ) </p>
<p>But this sub also seems to have way too many covid deniers, and people on the other end of the spectrum, who refuse to believe in the proof that it can be dangerous for some people. </p>
<p>The sub also seems America centric ( I know Reddit is American) . But then the American politics of " my body my choice" ,"  gun rights " always seems to be brought up here. Which as an outsider, I not only can't understand, but I can't get along with especially when we are talking about covid lies. </p>
<p>Anyway thank you for reading my rant . I hope you understand my pov . I hate our government mandates and the sheeple who believe the mandates are for our safety. </p>
<p>Ive had enough of my friends and family believing them as well.</p></p>

        <p>I read this sub a lot. I rarely see covid deniers. I did see one earlier today. That's okay if they want to believe that. I disagree, and I'm pretty sure the vast majority here do as well. However, most people here believe in freedom of choice and liberty. That extends to things like my body my choice and gun rights.</p>

<p>Nor do I.  I'm well aware that C-19 has caused almost 3 million deaths in the world, according to the official numbers.  That means that after over a year of this more than 99.96 percent of us have survived.  We have turned the world upside down over a disease that 99.96 percent of us have survived.</p>

        <p>The New Normal is more than just covid. It's an entire destruction of our entire civilization. There are a wide variety of people that are aware of it and want to stop it.  We're going to have to work together with people that disagree on the fine points.</p>

        <p>What are you going to do though.  Look at the pro rona subs you got people who run the gambit from sensible to wear 3 masks while going to bed.  So here you got the skeptics to flagrant conspiracy theorist deniers.  It's the internet.  Some of the crazy ones might be here to make the sub look bad.</p>

        <p>I'm certain the flu is dangerous for some people.  It always has been.  I think this particular version is worse than usual for older people.  In hindsight, more could have been done to protect them.</p>
<p>Whether that is by design or accident I do not know for sure.</p>
<p>I'm an American, so I can't really speak for what's going on in other countries.   I do like to hear what's going on around the world though and see other perspectives on this. </p>

        <p>As an American, I’m so sick of American politics taking over Reddit. You’re right, it’s annoying af. It’s a bit different here I’d say though because all of these issues we are having are directly related to politics and “my body my choice” is extremely relevant  in talking about vaccine passports and masks. The gun thing is pretty irrelevant &amp; some of the “libtard” type memes just make us look bad lol</p>

        <p>i hear you. i’m not american, and i definitely know what you’re talking about and it bothers me too. i try to focus on the maybe 70% of posts/comments (optimistically) that i find helpful or whatever, and try to ignore the ones i don’t. i feel like many on here (not just this sub of course) are overly aggressive and anyone who doesn’t share their exact opinion can “get fucked”. that kind of aggression i don’t get, and feel like it takes away from the point. now i’ve left a little rambly comment myself :) yadda yadda, upvote what u like, ignore the whack! 💞</p>

        <p>A lot of people are feeling hurt and defensive because of how the policies have affected them personally.  I see people on the other side being equally, if not more, aggressive at times.  Like I said, I like that this is a "safe space" to vent with no holds barred!</p>

        <p>Without guns you have no rights. All people have a right to bare arms. That isn’t an American thing. It’s just that other governments prevent their subjects having guns while we in the oldest and greatest country in the world- America- protect our rights in ways that inferior cultures such as the British don’t. It’s not our fault you sheep don’t have rights.</p>

<p>I am not from the US either and all it took was to spend a few hours of my day to read about "my body, my choice" and "gun rights." If you are too busy/lazy to do the research, simply say "ELI5" and someone WILL do it for you. A few weeks ago, there was a shooting that was blamed on an anti-Asian white supremacist that I didn't know about. I wasn't in the mood to research the incident and simply commented with "ELI5" below the content. This sub caters to both autodidacts and didacts.   </p>
<p>&rt; But this sub also seems to have way too many covid deniers, and people on the other end of the spectrum, who refuse to believe in the proof that it can be dangerous for some people. </p>
<p>People should be free to say what they think. If you want to take them to task for it, you can simply ask them for evidence. I am a super ultra anti-vaxxer and can always prove my conclusions based on peer-reviewed articles. The thing is that I have a right to be an anti-vaxxer even if I were to use auguring runes to reach my conclusion. "Free thinker" means that we do not limit the Overton Window and people are allowed to express themselves.</p>
