    <strong>You are being prepared for rationing.</strong>
    <p><p>Notice the emphasis on lockdowns - that randomly change, and the inability to predict from week to week what businesses will be open? Notice the ridiculous store occupancy limits which reduce throughput and cause lineups - rain or snow, day or night, freezing cold or blazing hot? How about the arbitrary taping off of "non-essential" items, according to some government bureaucrat's whim? Wonder why some sadist has decided your need for a new toaster, a coat, or garden tools doesn't matter?</p>
<p>Wondering what any of these measures has to do with the Rona?</p>
<p><em>The answer is... nothing.</em></p>
<p>If you have lived in the Eastern Bloc, or ever opened a history book, you will know that three basic blessings given to us by a market-driven, free society are conspicuously missing in accounts of the former Warsaw Pact or Red China - <em>abundance, convenience, and predictability</em>. In those societies, from bread lines, to random power outages, to waiting on a list for ten years to get a Trabant - getting you and your family through each day fed, clothed, and warm was a battle against random forces you neither understood, nor could change.</p>
<p>The 'Rona, coupled with "Green" ideology and the Great Reset, intends to bring you these "blessings" whether you want them or not.</p>
<p><em>You are being conditioned to accept a society where abundance, convenience, and predictability are a thing of the past - unless you belong to the elites. Just like Mother Russia, just like the DDR.</em></p>
<p>In the eyes of the elites, the lumpens need to be put back in their place - and it's happening - though most are too naive, stupid, and willfully blind to see it. And many make the age old mistake of thinking "I won't have to work. The government will look after everything. <em>Life will be sooooo dope, bro!!!</em>" Does this refrain sound familiar?</p>
<p>Rationing, rolling blackouts, a war on meat, the end of personal transportation, the end of single family housing, the end of plenty - it's all coming. And it will be a completely manufactured event. What the Globalists failed to achieve with 40 years of constant threats of environmental Armageddon, they will achieve in a year or two under the auspices of "Health Emergency".</p>
<p>The Dotard-Elect in the United States on his first day of office has already shown that the Greens, the grievance-mongers, the Globalists, the Luddites, the collectivists are going to run the show. Your needs, Joe Public, don't even register, let alone count.</p>
<p>Buckle up. It's going to be a rough ride.</p></p>

<p>Very good description, I lived in Eastern Block and it was exactly like that. Please don't treat this as condescending - people won't understand until they experience it and may take a couple of generations to understand it.</p>
<p>Now, there is a thing you've got wrong.  The "forces" are understood, it's totalitarian government and their cronies. People can change it, we did in 1989. You need to be prepared to fight, both politically and literally.</p>

        <p>The bit about "understanding" was mostly to do with the fact that the average Soviet or East German citizen probably had no real idea how decisions were actually made, or why.</p>
<p>For example, people being hauled off to the gulag exclaiming "What is going on? When Comrade Stalin hears of this, he will put a stop to it!"</p>
<p>Thanks for replying; it's always nice to discuss these things with someone who was actually there.</p>

        <p>You may be right. This also has a lot to do with the upcoming <a href="https://www.climatedepot.com/2020/10/05/physicist-upcoming-grand-solar-minimum-could-wipe-out-global-warming-for-decades/">Grand Solar Minimum</a></p>
<p>If the small minority of scientists saying the temperature will drop by more than 1 degree celsius are right. That could have drastic effects on agriculture, causing crop failures and possibly even widespread hunger – as occurred during the Maunder Minimum in 1710 (the last time a solar minimum occurred).</p>
<p>If we also lose much of our heating capacity, which is supplied by fossil fuels in the name of combating "climate change" by the time this is supposed to start in 2030 (that date and the UN Agenda 2030 with the same date is no coincidence), then we could be doubly fucked. </p>
<p>The powers that be undoubtedly know this and are trying to get themselves prepared to survive this as we speak, while at the same time killing off as many of us as possible by then, to both limit the threat to their survival/power and the ensuing competition for resources.</p>

        <p>Lol keep telling yourself that, when you are old and grey and the world passes you by for being a moronic NPC then you can talk. Until then your just another useless bag of meat like the rest of them.</p>
