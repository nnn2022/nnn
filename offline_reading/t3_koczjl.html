    <strong>The gaslighting is insane. Healthy people are sick and 2 + 2 = 5</strong>
    <p><p>Not sure if anyones seen my various posts on here but I’m a 23 year old living with doomer family during this pandemic and they’ve been following these lockdowns to an insane degree.</p>
<p>I finally just booked a hotel room for my birthday to meet up with my friends despite my moms threats  because I haven’t seen them in months. </p>
<p>My mom is now acting like I need to get tested before I meet them because “how do I know I’m not sick?” When I haven’t been out of the house (besides the park or grocery shopping) or seen anyone for the past 2 months. I live with 5 other people in our family and no one is sick. How the hell would I be sick?</p>
<p>Like this virus has completely shattered peoples mental capabilities. It’s gaslighting to the highest degree that I as a completely healthy person without any symptoms of any sickness at all, who has barely seen sunlight these last few months, would have this “deadly” disease and not know it.</p>
<p>And besides that, I’ve heard that it’s actually bad to get tested unless you’re actually showing symptoms or have traveled out of the country recently? Because that’s just adding to a longer wait for people who actually need the test. I’m not about to waste $75 on a damn test I don’t need.</p></p>

        <p>That is absolute insanity - how have people lost their ability to even <em>think</em> over this?!?</p>
<p>I have one of my sons staying with me since Christmas Eve, he's due to go back to his college digs tomorrow and his landlady rang in a panic earlier in the week asking 'has he seen anyone bar his mum and brother, because if he has, I'll want him to have a covid test before he returns!'</p>
<p>She <em>knows</em> due to my health I am almost housebound and don't see anyone...she <em>knows</em> my eldest son is an unsociable git who does his day's work on the farm and comes home - but every day my son is in college he's mixing with the 15 people in his class, the tutor, the bus driver, fellow passengers...you get the idea...but that's fine?!?</p>
<p>Just No. Logic. At. All</p>
<p>You have my sympathies OP!</p>

        <p>Ugh I’m sorry, we have honestly reached dystopia, that’s crazy! I remember when this virus first came out, it was a completely different narrative.</p>
<p>Back then I could understand the fear and even fell into myself because it was a completely new virus without any tests or PPC yet. So all of this made sense then. We were supposed to just keep numbers down so that hospitals don’t get overwhelmed.</p>
<p>But now it’s like they want complete annihilation which is impossible with a virus like COViD. And not only that but these people want to track our every move and behavior.  We have tests, a vaccine nearly ready, and stable hospitals so what the hell is the actual threat anymore? </p>
<p>All of this is completely unjustified given the circumstances that we’re in now.</p>

        <p>It's definitely dystopia, and I just don't understand the mindset of people who just throw all critical thought out of the window</p>
<p>None of this made sense to me at the beginning either...my spidey-senses were tingling once the daily bulletins from Wuhan started (long before lockdowns were implemented or the virus was 'officially' here) - I can understand why you were cautious at the beginning... it's not like you've lived through something like this before so it's completely understandable...I remember bird flu, swine flu, MERS, SARS and had no reason to think this would be 'bigger' and it's not, they've just dragged it out longer and amped it up further </p>
<p>I'm not sure how people are failing to see this is about control now...this 'virus' even with elevated numbers has only managed to kill 0.015% of the population in almost a damn year...'hospitals are almost at capacity!!!' (mmm hmmm, like every winter then)</p>
<p>It's definitely unjustified</p>

        <p>Seems like a pretty common sense policy to me. Test students when they come back. It's not about individuals, it's about having transparency across the university for contact tracing and preventing outbreaks.</p>

        <p>Did you read a word of what I wrote? How in the name of all that's holy can you call that 'common sense policy'?!?</p>
<p>If anything, he is many times more likely to catch and spread something <em>to me</em>, and ergo his landlady - how is he going to catch anything here?</p>
<p>Daily mixing with hundreds of people = no thought to test</p>
<p>A week with hermit mother = omg maybe he should be tested!!!</p>
<p>That's the opposite of 'common sense' - how often would you advocate testing when they go back? Daily???</p>

        <p>Without more specifics of the area you're in, the school, the apartment complex, its size, etc, I'm not entirely sure, but as a general rule of thumb it makes sense to test students after they've traveled for break, and you apply that policy uniformly partly as a matter of fairness and partly as a matter of efficiency. The fact that they're going out of their way to check in with you instead of just telling everyone to get tested or don't come is, in my opinion, a thoughtful thing to do. It would be much easier for them to just force everyone to get tested and disallow them if they refuse.</p>
<p>&rt; As for 'contact tracing' - please - you're ok to be tracked and herded over this? I'm not!</p>
<p>There's no herding happening here but yes I'm fine with being tracked. More to the point, I'm glad other positive test results are tracked. This is already happening for the most part, if you go to the gym (If it's even open) and someone who was there at the same time tests positive later, you'll typically be notified, depending on the area you're in. I'm glad that's happening because I would want to know if I was unexpectedly exposed, so I could change my behavior and make sure I don't visit any friends or loved ones who are high risk in one way or another. As far as the privacy concern thing goes, I empathize with the impulse but I don't think it's correct to view pandemic contact tracing as a cause for worry. They track extremely minimal information and what they do have is confidential. Frankly any degree of tracking that the CDC and state governments have in place in the US (which isn't much) pales in comparison to the level of tracking employed by Facebook, Google, and the other tech companies. Not to say that's good, just to say if you so much as own a phone, that's all happening there already. I'll be honest, I don't see any tracking infrastructure being implemented here by any org in a pandemic response capacity as even approaching the sort of tracking that people talk about in dystopian novels, and as such I genuinely struggle to understand the fear. Personally I am much more afraid of the risk of catching covid myself, or catching it and accidentally passing it on to a loved one.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that you have some health issues that are keeping you homebound. I truly hope that if those issues put you in a high risk category, that you will choose to take precautions that keep you safe. I know it's been a horrible horrible year but there actually is a light at the end of the tunnel and it would be a shame if something happened to put you at risk when we're almost there.</p>

<p>Not a clue if thyroid issues, fibromyalgia and CFS would make me 'higher risk' - life is a daily risk just getting out of bed...I choose not to be hysterical over a virus with overall recovery rate of 99.8%</p>
<p>I can't agree we are 'almost there' not by a long shot - depending even on what you mean by 'almost there' - at this point in time I see 2021 being a whole lot worse - I hope I am wrong and you are right, though 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

<p>Individual people make have really weird and idiosyncratic behavior. I am in agreement with you that her policy here doesn't make much sense, but I think it's fair to say that I have more patience for that kind of response given the circumstances. It's possible that something happened recently in her life specifically that made her more sensitive to the risks of accidental exposure, which would be at least one explanation for the apparent change of tone. I know that if I knew I'd be interacting with people then in some circumstances I wouldn't necessarily be willing to take the risk of taking them at their word on what they've done over their Christmas break, especially in the context we're in now where testing is generally readily available. I understand your frustration, and I would be frustrated too no doubt, I think where I differ is my willingness to extend the definition of her behavior from simply incorrect to some sort of illogical panic, because I know how difficult these times are and how hard it can be to effectively handle every new issue in a timely manner as they arise. I think on some level we just need to be patient with each other. </p>
<p>&rt; I can't agree we are 'almost there' not by a long shot - depending even on what you mean by 'almost there' - at this point in time I see 2021 being a whole lot worse - I hope I am wrong and you are right, though 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>
<p>A whole lot worse by what metrics? I ask because I don't doubt that some people will be hesitant to roll back mask wearing policies or resume more normal activities even when it is safe to, but I think that will be a minority of people. I feel quite confident saying the US will start to open back up in the next 3-6 months, and there will be some degree of normalcy by summer or by fall at the very latest. I'm not expecting you to take some random internet guy at his word, I understand that you will be skeptical of me, but I would be happy to expand upon why I feel so confident if you think it would provide you some peace of mind.</p>

<p>How does another national lockdown, in place til <em>at least 15th February</em> grab you? (bear in mind back in March we were asked for 'three weeks to beat this' so no WAY will it end then)</p>
<p>I actually hate being proven right over any of this 😔 </p>

<p>If there is a novel virus it will end when it ends whatever we do, like every other virus has</p>
<p>Lockdown is killing people needlessly</p>

        <p>Well, regarding Biden, a lot will depend on whether he has a majority in the senate. We still don't know, the run off election is tomorrow, but I'm not really optimistic about it. It's likely he will not have a majority in the senate and he will be blocked from more aggressive action there. But he can also help with the vaccine rollout, which so far has been much slower than it could be. On the new strain of the virus, it's likely that the current slate of vaccines will address that one as well. They are currently running the experiments to confirm. If that turns out to be incorrect, then it really mean re-evaluating the long term plan, but it's unlikely. </p>
<p>&rt; How does another national lockdown, in place til at least 15th February grab you?</p>
<p>February 15th of 2021? I won't lie to you, that seems like it's a very possible thing right now. Since you're not in the US I can't speak to specifics but in the US the way things are going I'm currently more or less planning for something along those lines to happen. It would take a very aggressive national strategy here to open sooner, so unless Biden does get that majority in the senate his hands will be pretty tied.</p>

        <p>I've heard many stories of utter incompetence on the part of nursing/care homes in multiple countries, as well as incompetence on the part of hospitals coordinating discharges to said care homes. Most people don't work in one, nor do they visit people living in one. Most people don't work in or for hospitals. These stories are both tragic and criminal, and I wish the people involved in these decisions that have resulted in the deaths of others could be criminally charged. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, countries have made it nearly impossible to charge those truly responsible for the rampant spread among the most vulnerable. Does that mean that all people should be punished as a result? The vast majority of people participating in this group say no.</p>

        <p>Because then they would actually have to take responsibility for their own health by exercising, eating healthy and giving up bad habits like smoking, alcohol and junk food.  It takes no effort to put a peice of cloth over your mouth or get a rushed vaccine. And then they get the bonus of acting like they are being responsible, while they actually do nothing.</p>

        <p>But how will you even tell if someone has the alleged virus or not? Since the PCR test does not even test for it.</p>
<p>There is an overwhelming amount of evidence showing that the PCR tests are not doing what they're supposed to be doing. The whole freaking world IGNORES this!!!</p>
<p>Who knows more about the PCR tests than it's inventor? Kary Mullis: "With PCR, if you do it well you can <a href="https://youtu.be/WF37L_z0vwM?t=2917">find almost anything in anybody</a>". The MSM are doing everything they can to censor &amp; ignore this.</p>
<p>Few weeks ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelYeadon3/status/1329225324383662080">a portuguese appeals court has ruled that PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test</a>, and that "the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is <strong>97%</strong>". Not a single word from the media.</p>
<p>Study from november 2020: <a href="http://philosophers-stone.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-scam-has-been-confirmed-Dsalud-November-2020.pdf">PCR does not detect SARS-CoV-2 </a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>There are cases in which the false positive rate is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1297711784044957699">100%</a></strong>. It depends on the lab because each lab uses a different number of amplification cycles for the PCR.</p>
<p>International experts suggest that <a href="https://westphaliantimes.com/international-experts-suggest-that-up-to-90-of-canadian-covid-cases-could-be-false-positives/">up to 90% COVID cases could be false positives</a>. Not a word from the media.</p>
<p>A group of australian lawyers have sent an open letter to their government: "This is no pandemic, <a href="https://concernedlawyersnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.11.20-CLN-TO-GOVTS-LETTER.pdf">Covid19 tests are unreliable to test any specific disease.</a>" They are also ignored.</p>
<p>Former chief science officer for Pfizer says <a href="https://discover.hubpages.com/politics/Pfizer-Chief-Science-Officer-Second-Wave-Based-on-Fake-Data-of-False-Positives-for-New-Cases-Pandemic-is-Over">"second wave" is faked on false-positive COVID tests</a>. What do the media do? They ignore him.</p>

        <p>I agree that it seems unnecessary to get tested prior to meeting you friends, but depending on what you do with them, and whether or not all of them have been tested recently, you probably will want to get tested before you go back home to your family. Getting exposed to covid while you are seeing your friends and then bringing it back home to your family is the thing I'd worry about.</p>
