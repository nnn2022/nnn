    <strong>How to actually make a difference? What are you or people you know doing?</strong>
    <p><p>NNN is great but let’s face it the content posted here is between a group of people who are already thinking the same way. How do we get it out to more people? Trying to post it anywhere else on Reddit gets you banned and it just gets deleted. Sharing it on most social media gets it censored. The places that do let you share it are similar to here. Filled with people who already support the things we do. How do we actually make a difference outside of NNN? What are people doing? For example are we getting on school boards and running for office? Are we reaching out to our elected officials or attending town halls and school board meetings? I’d love to hear about people who are doing more than posting here even if it’s smaller like affecting change inside your peer group at work or with your friends or church etc…</p></p>

        <p>It is vitally important that all the work we do is done in the real world, and not online. Have real conversations. Look people in the eye when you talk to them.</p>
<p>A few things that can be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>openly talk about the issues. Call things for what they are. Eg: government systems are bordering on totalitarian (some are already there), so call them that. </li>
<li>stickers (like the white rose movement) and leaflets.</li>
<li>join in on the protests.</li>
<li>non compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understand that what is happening is a period of mass psychosis, hence why governments and media can outright lie and do other unspeakable things (see: joost meerloo and carl yung). A delusion knows no logic, so cannot be fought with such. To break people out of the delusion, they need to first have their delusion of consensus broken. This is not easy, but the more we do it, the easier it becomes. How is this done? By speaking out. When people see the emperor has no clothes, the delusion comes apart.</p>

        <p>My point exactly this stuff has to happen in the real world. That’s why I would love to hear about what people are actually doing to make a difference. Ideas are great too but Literal stories of something they have done can be so powerful and encouraging to others to step up</p>

        <p>I don't want to say where is live, definitely not USA, but i speak openly, have shown half a dozen friends what is going on, all agree, and I continue to speak to strangers the same way, often with surprising results. Ive personally handed out 615 leaflets, my partner has done double that but they have more time. Ill be starting on stickers soon, waiting for printer to arrive. Ive also donated quite decent sums of money to various organizations and doctors to support them. With the doctors for instance, I'm booking in appointments to see them just so i can chat, i have no health issues, but want to discuss current events and see where they are at. Costs me a fair bit, but I'm trying to divert the path of totalitarianism we are headed on, so will be worth every cent.</p>

        <p>I just pledged to myself to print and wear only tshirts with messages of non compliance on every working day of the year this semester (I have screen printing equipment, but DYI fabric markers will get the job done just as well if not better). I will have hundreds of face to face individual meetings with college students because of my work. Can't wait to force a break in the narrative of consesnsus.</p>

        <p>I've thought a lot about this.  IMO, flyers on doors with basic factual info and where to find more.  While it should be self evident that there's no gain to "whoever" handed out the flyers and thus the info may be worthy of further inquiry, I also believe it's important not to hit the uninformed with "all" that we know.  Most importantly, it should focus on what will get people to ignore MSM, not comply with lockdowns and perhaps engage their representatives.  We need action, not just awareness.</p>

        <p>Maybe but I don’t know. I mean if I got some random flyer on my doorstep it wouldn’t probably just be ignored much like the various religious sects that do this. I mean that used to be a form of evangelism even in the Christian church and I think they finally realized it doesn’t work but who knows 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

        <p>I think the smallest thing we can do is lead by example. Don’t give in to the tyranny and the fear mongering. Inspired people need to run for local offices and school boards and effect change that way. People will follow if you lead, for example my employer got rid of masks when our state opened up but just this week decided to start requiring them for everyone again  when in the building based off of the CDC’s recommendation. I came in Monday and didn’t wear one (me and I think 2 other guys out of roughly 200+) now we aren’t in the building long because my job is mostly outside but the next day I came in same thing no mask. A supervisor tells me I need to put a mask on. Not wanting to lost my job over a mask I grab on and put it on my chin (not covering my mouth or nose) in front of about 30 others and my supervisor. Today when I walked in I had my mask on the same way but now I notice about half of my co workers are doing the same thing and one guy comes up to me and says “they said we have to wear one but not where” I just smiled and gave him a fist bump. Small I know but small things can lead to big change. Stay encouraged guys!</p>
