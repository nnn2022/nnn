    <strong>Edmonton mask bylaw "mystery shoppers". Be careful out there!</strong>
    <p><p>I had a very interesting conversation with the lady at my local M&amp;M Meat Shop yesterday. I had not been there since the local mask mandate started.</p>
<p>She is older and always friendly and talkative with customers - a large reason as to why I do business there. After a couple of minutes chatting, I noticed she kept looking at the door - I was the only customer in the store. She asked me (very politely) if I had a mask, to which I replied that I had a medical exemption. </p>
<p>She replied, "That's ok; I had to ask you because I could get shut down if I don't".</p>
<p>I asked her if she had had problems in the past; she answered "No, but the City of Edmonton is starting to deploy 'mystery shoppers' who are actually bylaw officers, who will fine businesses for not enforcing mask bylaws, and try to fine customers too."</p>
<p><em>This is what we have come to: No money to sand and salt the roads, homeless camps and crime everywhere, businesses failing left and right - but the city has money to spend on mask bylaw snitches!</em></p>
<p>So if you are in Edmonton, watch out. The secret police are hard at work dealing with the important things - looking for those of us who won't muzzle up!</p></p>

        <p>I carry a paper copy of the bylaw in my wallet, and am fully aware of what they can do, and cannot. Up here in Canuckistan, you can be issued a bylaw fine, but can't be arrested etc. They will however sic collection agencies on you if you don't pay, you won't be able to renew your driver's licence/plates etc. </p>
<p>However, as soon as you say "medical exemption", they got 'nuthin. They aren't allowed to demand proof.</p>

        <p>That's true.</p>
<p>I will argue the point (calmly) until I sense the conversation is going south, at which point I leave.</p>
<p>If they call the cops, you can be arrested for trespassing. That is the stunt mask-Nazi businesses are pulling up here.</p>

        <p>I understand your point, but don't completely agree. Businesses are culpable in all of this for not standing up for their (and customer's) rights <em>in the first place</em>.</p>
<p>They chose to roll over and be made mask enforcers on behalf of the government - and many of them seem to be doing it with an unseemly zeal. They have enough money and political clout - they could have fought back - but they chose not to.</p>
<p>Many businesses are already lining up to get on the "immunity passport' bandwagon - against the interests of their own customers.</p>
<p>I feel your sympathy for many businesses is naive and misplaced.</p>

        <p>The US Constitution guarantees business owners the right to deny service to ANYONE for ANY reason, there is no arguing that fact. Yes there have been court rulings that go against this, that however does not mean the Constitution no longer has any meaning.</p>

        <p>But don’t laws protecting customers from businesses who discriminate exist? Is that what you mean about court rulings that go against that? I’m asking because couldn’t they also be sued or fine for race discrimination or handicapped discrimination? I agree about leaving, I also turn and leave immediately when they tell me to mask or don’t come in. I’d rather not give them my money at that point.</p>

        <p>Ok. Thanks for your response. I don’t think forcing the public to wear masks and all this covid hysteria is going to end well and I still believe it’s designed to kill small business. I still think these businesses should stand up for themselves and customers and not just be scared of being forced to shut down because I believe that’s going to happen anyways.</p>

        <p>I agree with that as well. To be clear I’m not advocating attacking them, but what I fear is by the time they realize what is happening it will be too late. I just want to be able to do something and have it make a difference, and that’s the most disheartening part for myself.</p>

        <p>The issue us that these businesses don't have the right to NOT require masks. It's a moot point that they have the "right" to require masks, because they don't have any right to allow/require a lack thereof.</p>

        <p>They can get around it by throwing a subtle hint that if you state you have a medical reason,they will leave you alone.</p>
<p>It's as easy as:</p>

<p>Customer: "Yes."</p>

        <p>As satisfying as that would be, you are opening yourself up to the police being called by doing that. You have destroyed stuff which you haven't paid for.</p>
<p>Imagine if you walked into a dealer showroom, and on the way out, you kicked a quarter panel on one of the cars, denting it. Technically, you didn't "take" anything, but do you really believe that there would be no repercussions?</p>

        <p>This is sad. A man was arrested outside Costco the other day to for not wearing a mask. Definitely avoid business that are bullying you into this tyranny. </p>
<p>Right now alberta is pushing an agenda. They released all the dangerous criminals and sexual offenders while lower booze prices. They want to defund the police and have their own private thugs enforce their propaganda. Right now you can do more time and get a higher fine for not wearing a mask then the guy who beat his wife half to death and raped his kid. Do you guys see this. A fucking mask. This is a scam. This is a dirty trick. There is no virus. This is a re-set. </p>

        <p>Husband and I haven't had a problem not masking up in Walmart, at least not until yesterday. They hired new security and a guard chased us halfway across the store yelling "Young lady! Young lady!" just to demand I wear a mask. When my husband ignored him, the asshole grabbed him by the shoulder and told him - in a much more hostile tone than how he spoke to me - to wear a mask. This shit isn't getting any better this winter.</p>

        <p>Your husband must have pretty good self-control.</p>
<p>Laying hands on someone over a mask is <em>way</em> across the line, especially for a rent-a-cop who has no powers of arrest or detention.</p>
<p>Bet they wouldn't dare do that with a shoplifter - they'd probably be charged with assault and harassment.</p>
<p>I haven't been in my local Walmart in a couple of weeks, as I am tired of being asked "where's your mask?" every time I go there.</p>

        <p>Oh he has excellent self-control. It's kinda funny: on the surface, he looks like your stereotypical scruffy long-haired thug with his black t-shirts and black cargo pants, but he's actually the nice one in our relationship. Not a pushover, but he picks his battles wisely. Absolute sweetheart unless you really push his buttons. I look like a cute little girl far too young to be with him - I'm actually older by a year - with all my colorful girly clothes and little hair bows. Yet I'm possibly one of the most cold, calculating, hateful, violent people you'll ever meet. Not bragging or anything, it just is what it is. Ever since that asshole put his hand on my husband, I've....oh the thoughts I've had could get this whole sub shut down. So I'll let you use your imagination.</p>
<p>Haha I'm shaking now just thinking about it.</p>
<p>When my husband turned around to face the guard, he kinda tilted his head regarding this "rent-a-cop" as you call them. Looking him up and down, sizing him up, before pulling his bandana up oh-so-slowly in  compliance. Not worth the trouble of defying orders at that moment, as Walmart is one of the only places to shop in this town. Though we'll be avoiding it when we can. Good thing too, because I really don't have my husband's self-control. Especially when my loved ones are threatened. I....ugh, our freedom of speech is too limited. And my heart is too filled with loathing. And I will never ever forget the face of that guard. He might not forget our faces either, as it seemed he might've been taking a photo of us in the checkout lane.</p>

        <p>Call Walmart and complain about that guard, They have a very strict policy never to lay hands on a customer unless in self defense. They would be very unhappy to know that one of their employees/contractors broke such a serious policy.</p>
<p>Source: Friend did security at walmart and variety of other places, they all have the same policy of don't touch unless it's self defense or to stop destruction of merchandise.</p>

        <p>They'd probably say it IS self-defense because we put the guard in danger by not wearing a mask. Besides, we're working toward going as off-grid as is humanly possible these days, so every corporate complaint or act of political participation kinda delays that. I appreciate the thought though. What about policies regarding photographing customers?</p>

        <p>Photographing customers how so? The security or the store? The store has the right to put up cameras and stuff for loss prevention/general security so I don't imagine they're violating anything, they can even photograph you if they ban you from the store for shoplifting for example, the alternative is being charged with tresspassing.</p>

        <p>Thank you! :) I'm not so concerned about them taking photos, I just wonder why. At this point, as much as we would like to, husband and I simply can't afford to boycott Walmart. And we sure as hell can't afford legal trouble, which is why I held my tongue and stayed my hand. I hope the guy was only snapping a pic to blast us on social media or have a laugh with his buddies.</p>

        <p>The way people act betray what they actually know and feel in their hearts. If that rent-a-cop truely believed that Covid was a super dangerous disease and anyone could be spreading it, would he really want to get close enough to a person to grab them? </p>
<p>If people were truely afraid of Covid would they take of their own masks just to yell at other people. It is all about control, and satifying the little tyrants that lives in all of us. They feel good being little dictators to others, shaming others, ruling others. It the same feeling that is driving Newsom, Cuomo, and the rest. They actually do not care about the life of John so and so who lives on Herkimer Street in some apartment in Brooklyn, they just enjoy the power they feel when they can shut down people's businesses, close schools, cancle events etc. The fact that people lives are in their hands is what feuls them. Those type of people if given enoguh power will be the Gadaffi's, the Assad's. and the Putin's of the world.</p>

<p>Fines generate revenue, so fining non-compliance businesses or people like yourself who lie about medical exemptions would actually generate revenue to fix the things you complained about.</p>

<li>
<p>Why lie about having a medical exemption? It's a mask. It's mildly uncomfortable to wear, and it's no more of an infringement on your rights than being required to cover your genitals when you go in public.</p>

        <p>Whether anyone HAS been arrested is a moot point, because no one SHOULD be arrested for choosing not to wear either pants or a mask. What you're basically saying is "if pants are the law, no exception, then masks should be the law, no exception" when both mandates are unjust. Regardless of whether or not someone has successfully claimed medical exemption in defiance of a pants mandate or mask mandate, no one should need any special exemption to be with or without any article of clothing.</p>

<p>We are gleefully destroying every symbol of the ideas and people who gave us the (formerly) free and open societies we used to enjoy.</p>

<p>You get a more severe punishment for not wearing a mask than for assault or robbery.</p>
