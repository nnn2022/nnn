        <p>We aren’t gonna agree on this one my friend. I did non security clearance work with them.. those were good men that hung from that bridge. I don’t care if they had nuked that whole fucking area. I’ll die on that hill. War is hell. Sure they killed some people but so does every drone we use. So did that Moab. It’s just more personal hand to hand. Dead is dead. You hang two men from a bridge and we kill 1000 of yours. When the Marines took back fallujah they wrote on the bridge a moving dedication to Blackwater. Blackwater would take on serious counter fire just to bring those marines food. They know.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, if it does change DNA, this could be groundbreaking, depending on how it does so and the efficiency. Now are we talking about the mRNA vax? It can get into the cell and it is obviously stable enough to translate. Which is neat, but not hard to accomplish in a cell culture (though quite a feat to do in a live human body). Naked mRNA is notoriously unstable in cytoplasm and is degraded very quickly, so there must be something else in there to shuttle it specifically into the nucleus and get it to the DNA. And how is it changing the DNA? Since the spike protein gene is not homologous to any human genes I know of, I'm assuming we aren't just cutting stuff out. Are we inserting the spike protein? How the hell are they doing that? Have they perfected gene editing in humans? If so, there might be a Nobel in the future for them. Very exciting stuff.</p>

        <p>No, the treatment doesn't change DNA. It does, however, 'reprogram' a person's cells by introducing new mRNA. The mRNA then utilizes the cell's ribosomes to produce the same spike proteins that are found on the covid virus (the spike proteins are what enable the virus to enter our cells, where they can then reproduce - those red spikes in all the pictures of the virus). One result of the spike protein production is that the body responds by producing antibodies to destroy the spike protein, which can be repeated during exposure to prevent the virus from entering our cells, where it would be able to reproduce and spread.</p>
<p>What's concerning is that it is unclear how long the introduced RNA will stay active inside a person's cells. We also don't know for how long the spike proteins will be present inside/on the cells after they're produced, or what the potential long-term effects of the presence of the spike protein will be. It's possible for the spike protein to provide an access point for another virus to enter the cell that would otherwise not be able to. The spike protein could also be what's largely responsible for the serious damage caused by the virus, and could continue to cause harm on its own.</p>
<p>Here are some readings if anyone wants to learn more about it:</p>
<p><a href="https://scivisionpub.com/pdfs/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf">https://scivisionpub.com/pdfs/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf</a></p>

<p>Now, the difference between what I've just described and 'changing a person's DNA' may not be very clear to those without a background in microbiology/genetics, so it's understandable that those individuals may misinterpret what they've read or heard. It's still cause for concern that the treatment alters a cell's function and changes the mRNA present within its membrane. We've already seen thousands of adverse events being reported. So while you are technically correct (bravo!) people are justified in their skepticism, especially when Big Tech is censoring the discussion.</p>

        <p>&rt; What's concerning is that it is unclear how long the introduced RNA will stay active inside a person's cells.</p>
<p>It is not unclear, lifetime of mRNA in cytosol is short. Once mRNA, any mRNA, gets into the cytosol it's on the path for death. Quite sad, because it would be so great to just transfect cell lines with mRNA and expect it to express the gene of interest forever. But no, mRNA gets eaten alive quite quickly. For this reason, there is much interest in methods of inserting genes into DNA so they can make mRNA whenever. Like crispr. </p>
<p>&rt; It's possible for the spike protein to provide an access point for another virus to enter the cell that would otherwise not be able to.</p>
<p>Woah. That's interesting. I have never heard of a virus spike protein acting as a receptor for another virus. How does that make sense for the virus? Nevermind even that, if the spike protein produced in the human cell is inserted into the plasma membrane, which I could imagine since the spike protein probably has a transmembrane lipophilic region, since there is no mechanism associated with the foreign spike protein for endocytosis or other mechanism of uptake, how does the spike protein act as a receptor? Nevermind even that, since protein lifetime is also short --especially short since it is a foreign protein that is likely not where it is supposed to be based on its properties (there are normally lots of signals telling the cell where to put a protein), the supposed action as a virus receptor would be short lived. </p>
<p>&rt;  The spike protein could also be what's largely responsible for the serious damage caused by the virus, and could continue to cause harm on its own.</p>
<p>This is kind of relevant. The damage a virus can cause is due to it's ability to multiply. However, the thing that is harmful to human, is less so the cell death caused by the virus, but the body's immune response to the virus. And one of the regions that immune response will target, is the spike protein. SO, I guess you could say the spike protein is harmful. If there is enough of a reaction to the mRNA vax spike proteins that immunity is generated, then that there is the harmful effect. However, much more mild than the virus which replicates, considering mRNA is a dead-end as I mentioned before, and it will not replicate to continue producing spike proteins causing a huge and potentially fatal immune response. However, in some individuals I imagine there is a chance for a hyperactive immune response. This is not unusual, even for something like antibiotics. </p>
<p>Cheers</p>

        <p>&rt;It is not unclear, lifetime of mRNA in cytosol is short.</p>
<p>How short, specifically? And for how long after translation is the spike protein present in the cells? Legitimate question, I'm not trying to be confrontational, but I haven't been able to find any vaccine-specific data.</p>

<p>&rt;Woah. That's interesting. I have never heard of a virus spike protein acting as a receptor for another virus. How does that make sense for the virus?</p>

<p>What I understand from this letter is that it's the spike protein itself that can cause the damage to the tissues. On top of the potential immune reactions. "In other words, viral proteins appear to cause tissue damage without actively replicating virus."</p>

<p>Woah, I just read that. I am alarmed. I notice many of your arguments are from that. This really should be illegal. That is a lot of misinformation covered in technical speak. Oh, boy. I don't even know where to begin, but I'll try. First off, this is published in what we call a predatory journal. This is when a journal will publish your work without peer review for a price. My spam box is often full of requests by such journals to publish with them, promising quick -short review process (there is no review). Kind of a neat business model, all you need to pay for is website hosting (no need to print or pay editors), send out some emails, find someone who wants to publish and charge them 1200$ per article. I wonder how much Scivision makes per month net. I remember some colleagues of mine would even receive emails requesting them to be on the board of editors, all they had to do was say yes so they could use their name. </p>
<p>I can imagine how you stumbled upon this article, and I never have. And you wouldn't think to question it, because hell it looks formal to me. There are many journals that have "Microbiology and Infectious Diseases" in their title, I thought it was one of those. Until reading the content. I would say stick to pubmed, if it is not on pubmed it is not a real journal. I see the author Classen actually pops up on pubmed, but it's something weird and I am not prepared to go down that rabbit hole. </p>
<p>&rt; How short, specifically? And for how long after translation is the spike protein present in the cells? Legitimate question, I'm not trying to be confrontational, but I haven't been able to find any vaccine-specific data.</p>
<p>In humans a host mRNA (human mRNA) can probably last up to a couple of days (stretching it though). Non-host foreign mRNA less than that. Proteins are also on a death sentence after they are made (except for a handful that have unique roles in the body are for life, more or less). A viral protein (foreign) would not last long, less than a week.</p>
<p>&rt; What I understand from this letter is that it's the spike protein itself that can cause the damage to the tissues. On top of the potential immune reactions. "In other words, viral proteins appear to cause tissue damage without actively replicating virus."</p>
<p>The letter does indeed talk about an exaggerated inflammatory (inflammation = immune) response to the spike protein causing vascular damage in different organ systems. I would expect there to be some people who develop a nasty immune response to the vaccine, like the letter talks about. Can we predict who these people are? Probably not. I can say however, from previous vaccines that are killed vaccines (which is comparable to this mRNA vaccine because the immunogenic stuff in both is a viral protein), that the number of such hyper immune responses is very low.</p>
<p>The spike protein by itself doesn't really do anything other than bind the receptor leading to engulfment by the cell. The virus then has a whole thing that goes into motion to keep itself alive (because normally cell will destroy that thing it just ate quickly). Can we say 100% the spike protein doesn't do other stuff? Well, almost, but no we can't. Most proteins work like locks and keys. In order to interact with a protein, you need to be made for it. The odds of some random protein interacting with another isn't zero, but given the many possibilities of shape and form it's almost zero. Would be a fun problem for a bioinformatics guy to work out what the actual odds are.</p>

        <p>&rt;Woah, I just read that. I am alarmed. I notice many of your arguments are from that. </p>
<p>On this one specific point that the spike protein may provide access for other pathogens into the cell, yes. </p>

<p>Scivision claims the journal is peer reviewed, you claim it isn't. Also, assuming you're right in that you need only pay to be published, that isn't necessarily proof of the contents of the article being false. What motivation would an accredited immunologist have to lie to the public like that, especially if it costs him $1200 to do so? Aren't the concepts discussed possible, even if only theoretically? I have a tough time believing that he pulled those ideas out of thin air. Either way I'm not going to treat it as gospel. Grains of salt all around. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I would say stick to pubmed, if it is not on pubmed it is not a real journal. </p>
<p>PubMed is ran by the NIH, which has a financial stake in the Moderna vaccine. Can you appreciate how that would make someone skeptical? Not in terms of the things they publish, but the things they choose not to. Is there any requirement for PubMed to publish a journal article if it meets a certain criteria? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Proteins are also on a death sentence after they are made (except for a handful that have unique roles in the body are for life, more or less). A viral protein (foreign) would not last long, less than a week. </p>
<p>So we have an estimate for viral proteins generally, but for the specific spike protein resulting from the vaccine, we do not have an exact figure. In what quantity, and for how long after one dose? 2? We may even need 3 doses now. If it turns out to be the case that the vaccine needs to be taken every year like the flu shot (possible, but who knows what the future holds) at 3 doses per year, wouldn't the prolonged presence of the spike proteins from the 're-upping' have the potential to be harmful? </p>

<p>Also I just want to be clear that I'm not opposed to people willingly taking the vaccine. I personally won't be, but that's mostly due to a lack of necessity. I'm in a very low-risk demographic and keep myself healthy. </p>
<p>I appreciate your in-depth explanations and civility. I'm genuinely trying to learn as much as I can about the vaccine from as many sources as possible.</p>
