    <strong>Guerrilla Tactics: Can’t convince people directly, but maybe indirectly.</strong>
    <p><p>Everyone  on this sub (people without accounts too) could make 100 calls to restaurants and businesses to ask a reasonable question: <strong>"Do you have dine in service?"</strong> or <strong>"What time do you close?"</strong>  These could be businesses 100 miles from where you live. </p>
<p>Then say, <strong>“Oh, do I have to wear a mask to enter your shop?”</strong> followed  by, <strong>“Oh, we’re still doing the pretend pandemic?”</strong>  If the person gets  offended, then say you’re just kidding.  Probably they will laugh in agreement.</p>
<p>People need to think that others are questioning the pandemic also- it gets them out of their shell.  They already know it is nonsense deep down, they just don’t realize it yet.</p>
<p>Trust in mainstream media is at an all time low, and 58% of the public thinks that the media is intentionally trying to mislead them.  Congress hasn't had an approval rating above 10% in decades.  People will trust a random person on the other end of the phone more than the establishment.  The problem is that people are living in bubbles and only hear from the media.</p></p>

        <p>Seeing the down votes already!  Guess we just hide behind screens like the establishment wants us to do/has conditioned us to do.  Just channel our frustrations into an echo chamber that doesn't influence the outside world.  No pain, no gain, no problem.  Welcoming the New Normal!</p>

        <p>Because your cult never wore a mask for any other respiratory virus. Multiple studies show the uselessness of masks. Florida compared to California shows the uselessness of masks. Why do you think virologists wear hazmat suits when you can wear an old sock? You ignore science and common sense to worship the big pharma cult. Now go get your jib jab</p>

        <p>Sure there's a pandemic happening. But it's not serious enough to justify all of this. In the beginning, most people followed all the stupid rules and they didn't work. If it's really because people aren't following them, then maybe we should just accept that we'll never reach the level of compliance required for it to work and try something else? Stop dragging this out and look for another solution?</p>

<p>Literally not true at all. Since the beginning of the pandemic this group of selfish ignorant people have existed. They've continued to be a problem.</p>

        <p>Deaths are recorded as any death within 28 days of a positive test, so many of those deaths are simply recategorised. Does that sound like an accurate recording method to you?</p>
<p>The group of lockdown skeptics still mostly followed the rules in the hopes they'd work and go away, myself included. But regardless of the reason, it didn't work. If we didn't get the level of compliance we need, we're not going to get it now. If I complied with every rule in the book, it still wouldn't make a difference.</p>
<p>And I don't hate the vaccine. I'm glad that we have a vaccine available to protect those actually in danger from covid. But I don't like the idea of vaccine passports, the gateway to a segregated checkpoint society. That's just wrong. Personally, looking at my risk of covid I don't think the potential risk of injury from one of these vaccines is worth it since I don't need protection from this, but I'm glad that the option is available for those who do. But even with vaccines, there's still no planned end to restrictions in many countries. Until the restrictions end, I won't see vaccines as a solution. And actually, that wasn't my point. Before we had vaccines, we continued with these restrictions of debatable impact that were causing undeniable damage. Back then, and still even now, no one tried another strategy even though in no pandemic planning did we plan to do lockdowns. No one acknowledged things like focused protection, we just said lockdown harder without a care for what suffering that caused.</p>

<p>Covid kills people through many means, and if you have other problems already it makes it way easier for you to die from those. Just like some illnesses will give you pneumonia and you die from that. </p>
<p>So no I'll agree it's not the most accurate way to count something, but when there are morgues that are literally overfilled and the assessment of death isn't going to be accurate, it'll have to do.</p>
<p>But let's go ahead and say that 400k of those deaths are inaccurate, I am still concerned that 100k people had to die because people couldn't get their shit together.</p>

<p>It's just not true lmao. How many states just opened back up in the middle of this? Wisconsin didn't enact ANYTHING for MONTHS and deaths and confirmed cases skyrocketed. AND STILL a majority of people didn't wear a mask. Your personal experience differs from mine but they kinda just cancel each other out. I guess we'll just have to take the numbers that we have where we did objectively worse than any other country.</p>
<p>&rt;But I don't like the idea of vaccine passports, the gateway to a segregated checkpoint society. That's just wrong. </p>
<p>It's not when there's a fucking pandemic and you can quickly, easily and freely get a vaccine. With the "vaccine passport" you can guarantee that you won't cause a super spreader event because the person going will be VACCINATED. It's not about hurting your feelings, it's about public health.</p>
<p>&rt;Until the restrictions end, I won't see vaccines as a solution. </p>
<p>What? You won't see vaccines as a solution to end the restrictions until the restrictions end? ???</p>
<p>&rt;Before we had vaccines, we continued with these restrictions of debatable impact that were causing undeniable damage.</p>
<p>You're right, when we did not have much information about the virus causing the pandemic, we locked down. Some places did, some didn't. The ones that didn't saw huge spikes in deaths related to the virus and then eventually shutdown. Some places reopened prematurely and then shut down again because of a spike of deaths.</p>
<p>&rt;Back then, and still even now, no one tried another strategy even though in no pandemic planning did we plan to do lockdowns.</p>
<p>Why would we try another strategy when literally dozens of countries were able to do this exact thing successfully. Literally we just look like morons because of people not following the steps of other countries where they successfully dealt with it.</p>
<p>Sure you can bring up the fact that there have been many flare ups in other countries. But that's the thing, the virus is VERY contagious and that's what happens.</p>
<p>You keep bringing up other solutions when we have an answer and the only "solution" that this side brings up is putting their heads in the sand and acting like it doesn't exist.</p>

        <p>Really? Idk. From day 1 our 5 mayors of this county met with the police unions and it was agreed to not do covid. So we don’t have lockdowns or mask policy. The police won’t take a mask call unless it violent. No businesses had to close. Now big chain store do require masks but I’d re-circumcise myself with a bottle opener than shop at Walmart or target. I use Amazon. Then all the food service places went drive thru only and saw increased profits. I’ll eat at my comfy pad than inside anyway. The hospitals are bleeding money because for months they couldn’t do electives or minor procedures but also had no covid patients so they couldn’t collect the $15,000 per patient.</p>

        <p>You might think it is a joke, but in big cities like New York City, the major clothing stores pay charismatic people to wonder around tourist areas in search of families of tourists.  Their job is to strike up a conversation that ends with them telling the family about this great clothing store down the street that is having big sales.  This comes after pretending that they find it interesting that the family is from Oklahoma.  Naturally, the parents can't argue against the kids wanting to check the place out after a fellow tourist just shared this valuable tip.  This moves millions of dollars.  The world is more sophisticated than you think.</p>
