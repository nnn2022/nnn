<title>Would it help if we all apologized in advance for the surge in vaccinated deaths during the Winter that will undoubtedly be blamed on the public and "Covid variants created by the unvaccinated" by the government and media? "SORRYYYYYYY! DID I DO THAAAAAT?!"</title>

    <p><p>Just wanted to get ahead of Boris and all the other shit-heads in parliament. Now that that's out of the way...</p>
<p>Either I'm right, in which case we should all be fucking shitting yourselves, or I'm wrong and we should be back to normal by then, in which case: awesome. That's exactly what we all fucking want. Face it, doomers: if you were as confident in the vaccine as you claim to be you'd have moved on from this fucking shit by now and stopped screeching at us to "get the heckin' jab". You aren't fooling anyone: you're fucking bricking it and you only want the rest of us to get it so it validates your decision and we can all go down with the fucking ship together.</p>
<p>If our predictions prove correct we'll get to watch them justify it by saying the old people were going to die anyway and it's Winter so OF COURSE there'd be an increase in deaths... you know, the shit we were saying about Covid for the past year and a half. But hey, at least they got to spend their last few months with ~~friends and family~~ the nice staff at Shady Oaks Care Home.</p></p>

        <p>Went through this last year, this is why it won't matter:</p>
<p><em>Calling one a "Conspiracy Theorist:"</em></p>
<ul>
<li>is merely an <strong>A</strong>dÂ  <strong>H</strong>ominem <strong>A</strong>ttack declaring how ignorant the attacker is. <em>Which is a fundamental difference between people</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When a conspiracy theorist says "<strong>AHA,</strong> lemme look into this," the attackers that label people have had that portion of their brain lobotomized.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>"That sourced fact threatens my sense of reality, so I'm just gonna say you're crazy without checking your source or providing sources, I'll just try emotional attacks..." </p>
<p><em>aka the literal lowest IQ form of debate, as it relies on manipulation of empathy triggers and zero actual facts, evidence, or critical thinking</em></p>
<p><strong>Let's paint this picture:</strong></p>
<p><em>You're arguing with someone, but you have zero information on the topic. How do you win the argument?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>you appeal to the audiences' emotion, whether that be anger, fear, love, sympathy, etc.... except none of that is real or relevant to the debate, it is a manipulation tactic</li>
</ul>
<p><em>due to media manipulation and censorship the lies and agenda is catapulted foward as the truth is censored. I assume this is why some people would be better described as zombies</em></p>
