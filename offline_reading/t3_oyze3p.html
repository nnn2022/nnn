    <strong>We have a doomer come by my work everyday</strong>
    <p><p>He's an old man, a later boomer. He comes by every day for his daily routine and my coworkers and I chat with him. He's well educated and was in a well respected industry before he retired. In the last week he has been very pessimistic and talks about COVID a lot. And I mean every day we see him he talks about the Delta variant.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Mind you, we work outside, in open air. There's a slight breeze about half the time. Anyways, he watches the news <em>way too much</em> and it shows. The guy cannot talk about anything expect COVID and politics, while before the pandemic he would mainly talk to us about politics. It has gotten to a point where he will yell at our customers for not wearing a mask, outside. He has told us he is very tempted to tell other large groups to wear a mask as well, as there are large groups that walk past our work/come in. And it's all outside. </p>
<p>There were about 30 people standing around, outside, and he said to us something like, ''I'm going to have to walk around these people, they aren't even wearing a mask.'' As they stand off of the sidewalk so people can still walk by. Last week there was a group of about 50 people and who were outside, maskless, and he was very close to going up and telling them to put on masks. </p>
<p>It has gotten to a point where my coworkers have said that he should just stay home if he's so worried. Yet he comes by everyday and complains about the same things. Keep in mind I work with zoomers who would not identify as right wing. This is how I imagine Redditors in real life.</p></p>

        <p>I have the feeling he’s going to yell at the wrong person one day. One of the dumbest things to do in life is go and harass and yell at random strangers. The more he does it, the greater the odds he yells at the one person who’s having a bad day and is looking for an excuse to get physical.</p>

        <p>My grandad is 80 and I love him to death. I cannot talk to him about Covid and the vaccine though lol. I don’t blame him. At one point you could probably trust what the news was saying.</p>
