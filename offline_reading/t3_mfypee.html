    <strong>International travel this month</strong>
    <p><p>I just made a trip from Arizona to California, California to Germany, Germany to Sweden, Sweden to Finland, and Finland to Estonia.</p>
<p>Arizona: no one gives a damn, life much like normal, very few people wearing masks. Airport seems like usual, people wear masks there but no one seems to pay attention when they are pulled down.</p>
<p>California: people are scared, a lot of places are still closed, high level of mask wearing. But in the domestic flights area its busy, much as normal. I have to take the mandatory covid test, a swab up the nose for $120, what a rip off, but I can't travel where I'm going without it. International area of airport, very few people, about 25% normal capacity.</p>
<p>Germany: there are 16 people in economy class in a plane built for 200, airport is almost totally dead inside. Everyone is wearing N95 masks, police everywhere. I cough while drinking water and an airport cop looks at me with intense suspicion.</p>
<p>Sweden. Airport; Attitude really chill, police not wearing masks, security checkers not wearing masks, customers not wearing masks. The only ones wearing masks are airline personnel.</p>
<p>Finland: airport everyone is wearing masks, I'm forced to show my covid test, then asked drilling questions why I'm there, finally they let me go to my terminal.</p>
<p>Estonia: people are wearing masks in the airport, but they only seem to do it out of obligation. The passport control waves me through without checking my covid test. There is a feeling of apathy towards the covid rules in the baggage pick up almost no one was wearing a mask. In town the taxi driver did not have a mask, maybe 10% of people walking around had a mask. In malls people wear them but that is about it.</p>
<p>So that is my experience of covid restrictions during travel this month (March 2021). I got the impression that a lot of the officials and government employees were absolutely sick of playing covid-cop to travelers, EXCEPT IN GERMANY and to a lesser degree in California and Finland. Has anyone else traveled internationally recently? What's your insight?</p></p>

        <p>In Jan went to Cabo from maskloversparadise Seattle.  More relaxed in Cabo vs Mexico City (Where I went in Oct 2020).  </p>
<p>But still high level of mask usage. </p>
<p>Was hiking in Torrey Pines by San Diego a week ago...lots of out of state travelers I think judging from t-shirts/baseball caps. 75% mask, 25% no mask.</p>
