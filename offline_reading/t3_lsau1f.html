    <strong>Honest questions to the lurking doomers</strong>
    <p><p>Why do you always say "you wouldn't be against the lockdowns and restrictions if it was your loved one who died of covid!!" like it's some kind of gotcha.</p>
<p>If my loved one died of covid despite the lockdowns and restrictions, then how is that an argument that lockdowns and restrictions work? It's the opposite.</p>
<p>Also, did it not once cross your mind that some of our loved ones who are at risk are already so old that we (and they) are being realistic that they don't have very long to live and would rather spent their remaining time on earth LIVING and having human contact?</p></p>

        <p>None of this ever crosses their minds because they're incapable of empathising with others who are in a different situation to them.</p>
<p>They think all their problems can be solved through the collective action of everyone else, instead of them taking some responsibility for their own lives (and the people they share it with). It is a childish mentality, they believe their problems are everyone's but their own.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, cancel culture is a classic example. Just a bunch of people who don't like what someone says, so instead of taking responsibility and avoiding the person they don't like, they prefer it to be their opponents problem and cancel them.</p>

        <p>Whenever people say that, I always mention how it's not like that for anything else. No one says "You think we should still be allowed to drive cars? You'd think differently if a loved one died in a crash!" No one says "You think pneumonia isn't worth controlling our lives? Tell that to the people that died from it!" No one says that. If someone is old and dies from the flu or pneumonia or something, no one ever says "It's because of people like you for not going out of your way to go to ridiculously extreme measures to protect my grandma!" It's just considered her time because getting sick is a part of life, and if you're older and at death's door already, it's probably going to kill you. It's not that we don't care, it's that that just happens in life and it's just considered their time since they were close to death anyway. That's what happened to my grandpa, and not a single person blamed anyone for it because sickness inevitably goes around. I know that might come off as cold-hearted, but it's a fact of life.</p>

        <p>You’re exactly right. It’s like all of a sudden we decided “you know what we’ve had the wrong attitude about this whole sickness and death thing. We can totally beat nature and never get sick and no one will ever die again. Just follow steps one through five..” not only is it unscientific and frankly sort of arrogant, it is literally making the health of many people worse.</p>

        <p>Seriously. Every one of my grandparents died of random respiratory infections over the past decade. That's life. </p>
<p>No one cared, no one wore masks, no one's business was shut down. According to these people their deaths dont count because they weren't from covid. It's ridiculous.</p>

        <p>I say, "you would not be <em>for</em> lockdowns if dozens of other people didn't have to go to work on packed Tube trains to get your pampered, trust-fund dough-ass your Dominos, heating, and porn." Most of the evangelists are liars only in it for the virtue. Exposing them as selfish hypocrites who endanger others destroys them. If we had a 'proper lockdown' they'd freeze or starve.</p>

        <p>It's such a stupid argument. If my loved one died from covid I'd be pissed that thanks to the stupid policies, I was unable to see them before they died, that they died alone in a hospital room with a faceless nurse (if they actually stayed in the room) and that I wouldn't be able to grieve with my family and attended a funeral.</p>

        <p>My grandfather is 94 and still drives himself around (in his red 2014 Corvette Stingray). I'm more worried about him crashing or being hit by a drunk than catching a cold and dying of it.</p>
<p>Motherfucker was in the Kaiser shipyards at 16 welding Liberty ships in the SF Bay, then in the NAVY during WW2, a teacher for a few decades, then burnt his house down (accidentally and while he was still in it) when he was 89ish, <em>then</em> had <strong>open heart surgery for a new valve</strong>. The man is pretty tough.</p>
<p>Now, he's old. I get that. He's 94 and I'd love to see him make 100, I really would, but I'm not going to take his keys from him and say, "It's too dangerous for you to drive, you have to live to be 100”. I'm not going to take his fishing boat from him saying "It's too dangerous for you to be out on the water, you have to live to be 100". I'm not going to put some nurse/warden in his house and say "It's too dangerous for you to live alone, you need to live to be 100".</p>
<p>The man is free!!! He loves being free!!! I love him <em>being</em> free!!! The last thing I want is to see him waste away in some nursing home, hopefully away from Andrew Cuomo. If he doesn't make 100, I'll be sad. If he does today, I'll be sad. But right now, the man is <em>free!</em> And I want the same for my niece and nephew, for my parents, for you, and for me.</p>

        <p>I don't consider myself a doomer, but I do lurk. I don't agree with most of what you all have to say, but I try to understand the other side. So remember you asked for this opinion. ....I don't always say "you wouldn't be against the lockdowns and restrictions if it was your loved one who died of covid!!", but sometimes I think it. I know many people that have gotten COVID, all were going against the recommendations and most of them think it was preventable.  I've "ignored the rules" myself at times, but I guess I've been lucky.  Some of the people I know that had COVID had a tough time with it.  1 hospitalized and bad breathing problems. A couple of them still can't taste or smell after 2 months.  One person I know died, and yes he was older.  Where I live (Charlotte, NC) For the most part, the lockdowns and restrictions were not enforced. There were businesses and people that went ahead and acted as if nothing was happening, usually without citation or action. The only things that haven't really happen in the "lockdown" were large public gatherings like sporting events and concerts and indoor church. I do think masks work. I do think social distancing works, but I think the way COVID spreads best is in a relatively closed environment with exposure of 15 minutes or more and I'll admit, for the average person, the chances of contracting are pretty low in many of the places you are required to wear a mask. So that's mostly people at home or those that work in close quarters to other people for an extended period. I think the lockdowns have helped in the sense that it elevates the seriousness of the situation and probably prompts people and businesses to be more careful. And the lack of large indoor events has likely helped as well. But I understand why people are upset and how it's changed their lives and livelihoods. And I'm sure some of the steps that have been taken are unnecessary or arbitrary, but it is what it is. I didn't consider it a major hindrance to my personal freedom. I felt it was more the right thing to do to protect myself and others when I could, which mostly meant finding other things to do. At least where I am the restrictions are starting to lift. I think our government was doing it out of an abundance of caution with constantly changing information and not simply to control people. Though they certainly may have overstepped their bounds at times.  I will continue to be careful and evaluate my risk in certain situations, but as soon as everyone who wants a vaccine can get a vaccine it's gloves off and we need to fully move on from this and get back to normal. At that point we will have put forth a lot of effort to keep people safe and I'm not willing to go further or longer with those efforts for this particular disease.</p>

        <p>COVID is the Boomer-Doomers' last chance to insist that the world revolves around their narcissistic selves (note, my broad brush is ONLY painting Boomers who are ALSO Doomers).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As a Gen-X'er, I was told to wait for the Boomers (or at least the narcissistic among them) to finish doing their thing before I got to start doing mine, until I had started going grey and bald. What fun! /s</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And as a Gen-X'er not too far behind the Boomers in years, I KNOW that I am getting on in life, and that my time to shuffle this mortal coil will arrive some time within the next 0-30 years (I had a grandfather who died in his fifties and a grandfather who died in his seventies). Nonetheless, I DON'T demand that the whole world just stop and cater (only) to my ever-aging self.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I hope that younger people help me with my needs should I reach decrepitude (hoping more for something quick instead), but I realize that the MAIN thing for the world at that point will be younger generations meeting their own challenges of economy, ecology, and humanity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I hope to have wisdom to contribute throughout my final years, and that wisdom would certainly include me NOT insisting that bars shut down because my old ass can't safely hang out in them…</p>

        <p>This whole sub is like defiant little children who see this as a test of their subservience and not one of an actual health crisis. Even the sub name seems to hint at the thought that this will be permanent. Not even the spanish flu lasted forever and did that radically change society into a dystopia? No. Did everyone get put into camps? Also no. Why do people still make the straw man that "wearing a mask saves the wearer"? Mocking it as if it's a totem against the virus, trying to portray some sort of savage religion? How many democrats or liberals are denying science and frequent this sub? Probably none, to very little. Except maybe the "classical" liberals, but they're closer to libertarians, which I assume also frequent this sub but I don't think in as high of a percentage as just conservatives.  </p>
<p>There's also little narrative cohesion here. Ranging from "the virus is a hoax created by bill gates to depopulate the planet" (an Alex Jones favorite, who, btw, has been debunked an insane number of times. He's literally just scaring people to sell pills and peddle his shitty brand) to "the virus is real but I will not be cowed down by a virus and I defiantly go maskless to show the world how unafraid I am of potentially putting people in the hospital". </p>
<p>This place is insane. No proof. And there's a post saying "this caged lion is people on lockdowns" "this lion is free and relies on their self" god what fucking delusion. Rely on yourself by giving up anything you didn't make your self, quit your job and live in the wilderness then. Such a joke.</p>
<p>Also, how do you not realize that not everyone followed the restrictions, masks, social distancing or otherwise? It's absurd to say "I'm not doing this" and then say "see? It doesn't work". And lockdowns/distancing/masks are supposed to <em>mitigate</em> the virus and slow the spread. I feel bad for anyone that has the misfortune of being anywhere near you all in public. </p>
<p>And for those of you that have said "I wear my mask and no one says anything" have you ever considered that these minimum wage workers don't want to be literally murdered for dealing with crazies? Because that's happened way more times than ever should have.</p>
<p>Cripes. This is the worst religion.</p>

        <p>Okay, thanks for your response. A few points:</p>
<p>"Even the sub name seems to hint at the thought that this will be permanent."</p>
<p>It doesn't matter at all will it be permanent. I don't want the new normal for any period of time. The new normal is not just the lockdowns and restrictions, it's normalizing things that should never be considered normal, it's hysteria, propaganda, dystopia, division, fascism, violation of human rights, looking at everyone as vectors of disease instead of human beings, shoving covid in our faces everywhere etc. Even if all of that ends tomorrow (hint, it won't) we will be feeling the effects of it for a long time.</p>
<p>"How many democrats or liberals are denying science and frequent this sub? Probably none, to very little. Except maybe the "classical" liberals, but they're closer to libertarians, which I assume also frequent this sub but I don't think in as high of a percentage as just conservatives."</p>
<p>I tune out when I see these political labels. They just serve to divide people and they don't mean anything. You don't have to label yourself any political label to be against this lunacy or to be negatively affected by it.</p>
<p>"There's also little narrative cohesion here. "</p>
<p>Yes, there is 40k human beings in here and human beings tend to have different opinions. Shocking!</p>
<p>"No proof. "</p>
<p>No proof of what? The whole premise of our opinion is that lockdown does more harm than good. I can link you plenty of proof of that.</p>
<p>"Also, how do you not realize that not everyone followed the restrictions, masks, social distancing or otherwise? "</p>
<p>I do realize this, it is in fact one of the reasons I do not support the lockdown. Because everyone has their limit of how much they are willing to stay lockdown and it's been a year of this. People will eventually have enough and start seeing their friends and family in their homes. For some that limit came a few months into the lockdown, for some it come a year into it, for some it will come soon. But every single person has a limit. And then absolutely all of these measures become pointless.</p>
<p>"And lockdowns/distancing/masks are supposed to <em>mitigate</em> the virus and slow the spread. "</p>
<p>I know that, but the question is do they? Now that it's been a year we should try to evaluate this. Why does Sweden, who did not lock down or require mandatory masks have less deaths than UK, who locked down hard and has mandatory masks? Why is Florida not the number one state in the US when it comes to covid deaths if lockdown and masks mitigate the spreads? It's fair to ask these questions. You doomers don't even allow this discussion, just screech that we're crazy and that we don't listen to DuH sCiEnCe!!</p>
<p>"I feel bad for anyone that has the misfortune of being anywhere near you all in public."</p>
<p>That's interesting since I don't wear a mask and I have noticed people start randomly chatting to me in public more often than before. Almost like people crave human contact and want to be near humans who are not dehumanized and masked up. Almost like they would rather choose having a human connection instead of the illusion of safety. Who would have thought!</p>

        <p>Your feelings shouldn't interfere with the public's health. Your decision is precisely as I've described it above. </p>
<p>A lot of people with libertarian leanings shy away from labels. But your beliefs aren't original and they can be categorized, whether you want to label them or not. Maybe creating a personality around it would be problematic. Just like you've said there are 40k people united under a single banner, but they have varying opinions on it. They can all be categorized, too. Acting like this is creating a divide, too, btw. </p>
<p>Link it. </p>
<p>I would guess population density. They have 3x less than the cases in the UK, but has 6x the population. So I think your numbers are off. You can ask, sure. </p>
<p>I don't see people wearing masks as dehumanized at all. You can still have a conversation with someone in a mask. My job requires me to talk to people, and we're both masked and I've had no problems relating to people.</p>

<p>See, that is your problem, you think public health = covid. But you're wrong, Public health also includes mental health and psychical health. These things are improved by human contact, normality, fresh air, exercise, ability to work and provide for yourself and your family etc. Things that are currently banned or told they will make us sick. Lockdowns have a greater negative effect on public health than covid.</p>

<p>I could go on linking all the negative impacts for days, but I think you get the point.</p>
<p>"I would guess population density. They have 3x less than the cases in the UK, but has 6x the population. So I think your numbers are off. You can ask, sure."</p>
<p>They have lower covid deaths per capita than the UK. If it was about population density they should have higher deaths per capita, but lower in total. Also you didn't give me an answer about Florida btw.</p>
<p>"I don't see people wearing masks as dehumanized at all. You can still have a conversation with someone in a mask. My job requires me to talk to people, and we're both masked and I've had no problems relating to people."</p>
<p>Most people disagree and I can't even count how many times I've seen people struggling to have a conversation while wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Covid has killed over 500 thousand people in the US with 28 million... million cases. You can take being inside. Call your friends. My wife has found a couple church related groups via zoom meetings she uses. I interact with my friends via discord. Very rarely have we seen each other and we've been fine because we're not being big babies about it. </p>
<p>A few of articles are speculative, talking about hunger crises that <em>could</em> happen. People thought the same at the beginning of the pandemic and yet, people aren't starving in their homes due to it. The vast majority of items are still available for sale at the grocery store. The cancer issue is due <em>to the massive influx of coronavirus</em> patients. The sheer number requires more medical attention as the cases are overwhelming and when hospitalized require more intensive care quickly. Here's a quote: </p>
<p>&rt;Carnall Farrar said: "The Covid-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on healthcare systems around the world, in large part due to the need for capacity to treat [coronavirus] cases, which has also had significant effects on non-Covid activity.</p>
<p>It's not just "well, STOP everything, doctors, take a break. Relax and <em>wait</em> for the influx of patients while we neglect current ones". If you stop all lockdown procedures and mask requirements <em>more</em> people will die. As they won't be able to get to more cancer patients and probably not some Covid patients. People have all ready died in due to lack of available treatment. How do you not know this? Would you feel better letting Covid patients die instead, possibly due to someone like you refusing to wear a mask when asymptomatic?</p>
<p>Domestic abuse is a very sad issue. My wife and I have donated quite a bit to the women's shelter nearby. We're in Texas so they're also having issues with their pipes, so doubly so. The blackouts also caused an influx of "cases they don't normally see" according to their facebook. It's extremely sad, yes, and those abusers need to be in jail. However, this is a <em>fantastic</em> reason for you to suck it up and deal with "isolation" (especially when obviously you see some people have it much worse than you, at least that's the club you're trying to use as a weapon) when you have the entire world at your finger tips. Including your friends and family via various web applications so that we can get through this more quickly. Think more along the lines of "we have to keep ourselves safe and others safe so we can get through this quickly" not "I'm TIRED of this and not only am I going to go to super spreader events, but I'm going to REFUSE to wear a mask". This is foolishness.</p>

        <p>"Covid has killed over 500 thousand people in the US with 28 million... million cases. "</p>
<p>No it hasn't killed over 500 thousand people. The way covid deaths are recorded in the US is everyone who has died of any cause will be recorded as a covid death if they tested positive in the last 28 days. Unfortunately it is unlikely that this will ever be investigated to find out how many people have actually died of covid (probably very few but that's just my opinion) but it is not 500 thousand people.</p>
<p>Cases are irrelevant if people can have covid with no symptoms. Cases do not equal sick people.</p>
<p>"You can take being inside. "</p>
<p>I have literally just linked you all the ways lockdown ruins lives, millions of people are being asked to lose their jobs, their businesses that they worked years to build, their kids don't get in person education and social contact with other children (which is incredibly important for development), are unable to see their family members who are in care homes. That is way more than being asked to stay at home.</p>
<p>You are being deliberately obtuse by pretending all that's being asked of people is to stay at home. That's true only for privileged people in secure jobs who can work from home.</p>
<p>"A few of articles are speculative, talking about hunger crises that could happen."</p>
<p>That's funny because speculation is the reason why we're in lockdown in the first place. Because people speculated that xyz number of people will die of covid and hospitals will get overwhelmed if we don't lockdown. There is no proof for this speculation and yet this speculation is the reason we are in lockdown. </p>
<p>"The cancer issue is due to the massive influx of coronavirus patients."</p>
<p>Incorrect. The hospitals get an influx of patients with respiratory viruses every winter, that is true. But this was not the case for spring and summer. In summer in particular the cases and death curve went all the way down and the hospitals were not overwhelmed then. In fact, I have seen several nurses speaking out that they had barely any work during spring and summer. Those nurses were censored and those videos removed.</p>
<p>"It's not just "well, STOP everything, doctors, take a break. Relax and wait for the influx of patients while we neglect current ones". "</p>
<p>Funny, because those nurses said this is exactly what happened.</p>
<p>"Would you feel better letting Covid patients die instead, possibly due to someone like you refusing to wear a mask when asymptomatic?"</p>
<p>I don't believe that a healthy person can make someone else sick. This will never make sense to me, sorry.</p>
<p>"Domestic abuse is a very sad issue. My wife and I have donated quite a bit to the women's shelter nearby. We're in Texas so they're also having issues with their pipes, so doubly so.

<p>Hmm, at first I was confused at what you're trying to say with this, but I think I get it. You think my issue (and others on this sub) with the lockdown is personal isolation? It's not. I have stopped following the rules ages ago. I am seeing my family and friends. I have been traveling. My issue with the lockdown is the bigger picture. The millions who will be pushed into poverty and lose their jobs and businesses. Children who are denied education and contact with other children. The violation of human rights. The govt should never be able to ban people from working and opening their business for a long period of time. The millions who haven't seen their family and friends in months. Etc. etc.</p>
<p>You really don't get it that some of us don't care just about ourselves. Some of us don't just shrug and say "well poverty, domestic abuse, mental health and lack of education is sad, but not more important than covid", like you do.</p>

        <p>https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-covid-19-deaths-are-counted1/</p>
<p>https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/how-are-covid-19-deaths-counted-it-s-complicated</p>
<p>&rt;...when asked about people who have COVID-19 but die from preexisting conditions: “If someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death.”</p>
<p>&rt;That statement, combined with some state health officials saying they follow the same policy, sparked charges that the COVID-19 totals were inflated by deaths from other diseases and even auto accidents if the victims happened to have COVID-19. Federal and state governments gradually altered such policies over the spring and summer to say that in order for a death to be counted as a COVID-19 death, the disease had to have played a role.</p>
<p>Try reading the article. These are <em>verified</em> sources. Not facebook posts, or twitter videos. Do you believe everything you see on Facebook?</p>
<p>You are eating conspiracy theories and propaganda like it's breakfast. </p>
<p>During times of crisis, we have to respond certain ways. These people will not be denied this for the rest of their lives. They can speak with them through electronic means. While those things aren't great for development, neither is your loved one <em>dying</em> from a disease. </p>
<p>You seem to blame the people for not working during a pandemic, and not the government for not providing means to get by during a health crisis? Or by enforcing a lockdown without also giving a means to get by? Go raid the capitol about it. Clearly some people can't support their selves and they need help. Someone who is immunocompromised or lives with someone who is being forced to work is essentially a death sentence. </p>
<p>Do you even know what asymptomatic means?</p>
<p>Are you being pushed into poverty? What does seeing family and friends and ignoring lockdown procedures have to do with others going into poverty? Even using your own logic, it's nonsense. Newsflash. This was a fucking problem long before the lockdown and is being exacerbated by a crisis. Surprise. Where was your self righteousness then? </p>
<p>You are literally just caring about yourself when you break lockdown procedures because you're feeling sad or lonely. Yes, I missed my family's thanksgiving and Christmas. We lamented about it on a <em>phone call</em>, but we understood that we don't want to put my grandparents at risk. My wife and I have donated hundreds to the shelter over the lockdown due to the influx of cases. The fuck are you doing? Spreading bullshit propaganda? Deluding yourself?  You're clearly too willing to believe whatever conspiracy nonsense you want to and deluding yourself into thinking you're doing something righteous or heroic. Have fun with your confirmation bias and remember what you're actually doing. You clearly didn't reason yourself into this position, so I won't try to reason you out. </p>
<p>It comes as a surprise that even after the science deniers of the Spanish Flu, 100 years later, here we are, with nothing learned. It's really just sad. Just get out of my inbox. Whatever drivel you're about to spout will just be another reason to cringe.</p>

        <p>"order for a death to be counted as a COVID-19 death, the disease had to have played a role."</p>
<p>Yeah, this certainly does not leave any room for misinterpretation. You showed me there!</p>
<p>"During times of crisis, we have to respond certain ways."</p>
<p>This is the fundamental thing we disagree on. You think there is a health crisis, I don't. There is a respiratory virus with a 99.99% survival rate and there is also media campaign that makes it seems like there is a health crisis.</p>
<p>"These people will not be denied this for the rest of their lives. They can speak with them through electronic means. While those things aren't great for development, neither is your loved one dying from a disease."</p>
<p>A year is a long time and a lot of elderly isolated people for example are unable to use technology. </p>
<p>Your loved one dying from a disease will probably happen at least once during your lifetime. It's a fact of life, people die.</p>
<p>"You seem to blame the people for not working during a pandemic, and not the government for not providing means to get by during a health crisis? Or by enforcing a lockdown without also giving a means to get by?"</p>
<p>You misunderstood, I don't blame people for not working at all. I blame the govt.</p>
<p>"Go raid the capitol about it."</p>
<p>Ooh, you told me off there! Don't know how I'm gonna recover from this. Never mind that I'm not American and don't give a damn about your capitol, we've established facts can't change your mind.</p>
<p>"Someone who is immunocompromised or lives with someone who is being forced to work is essentially a death sentence."</p>
<p>You have fully swallowed the fear propaganda. Most people with underlying conditions survive this virus. A 115 year old nun in France had covid and didn't even notice for gods sake! This idea that it's a death sentence is hyperbole with no basis in reality.</p>
<p>"Do you even know what asymptomatic means?"</p>
<p>Yes, I just don't believe it's a thing.</p>
<p>"This was a fucking problem long before the lockdown and is being exacerbated by a crisis. "</p>
<p>Again, fundamental disagreement, you think it's being exacerbated by a crisis, I think it's being exacerbated by the actions of politicians.</p>
<p>"You are literally just caring about yourself when you break lockdown procedures because you're feeling sad or lonely. "</p>
<p>I didn't break lockdown because I felt sad or lonely, I broke it because I felt suicidal.</p>
<p>"The fuck are you doing? Spreading bullshit propaganda? Deluding yourself?"</p>
<p>I am spreading the opinion that lockdowns do more harm than good. And every day more news come out proving me I'm right. Which is why you try to minimize the news I linked you and label it "speculation", because you know that if you admitted it was fact you would have to admit I'm right.</p>
<p>"It comes as a surprise that even after the science deniers of the Spanish Flu, 100 years later, here we are, with nothing learned. It's really just sad. Just get out of my inbox. Whatever drivel you're about to spout will just be another reason to cringe."</p>
<p>You're the one who responded to my post lol. I am not posting drivel, I am responding to your points, something you have failed to do when I asked you why Sweden and Florida have less deaths than some countries/states that went into hard lockdowns. I have calmly had a discussion with you and you are now mad because you thought you can own me with labels you put on me. But that doesn't work here.</p>
<p>"Drivel" "Science deniers" "Conservatives" "Libertarians" "Anti-vaxxers" "Selfish" "Murderers" "Capitol raiders"</p>
<p>These are labels you use to discredit people and paint them as bad people not worth engaging with. I do not speak this language. This is not normal behavior. </p>
<p>Humans need to approach one another by discussing ideas, opinions and facts, not by insulting, labeling each other and then telling them to "get out of your inbox" because they have told you something you do not want to hear. You are suffering from a mental illness called buying into the media fear porn and propaganda. </p>
<p>You believe that others should give up what makes life worth living just so you would have the illusion of safety and you are mad that they refused to do so when the real people you should be mad about is the ones who headlined a year long media campaign that made you feel scared and unsafe.</p>

        <p>The first question, they're expecting them to have empathy. Following the recommended procedures is literally proven to slow the spread. </p>
<p>The second question is a terrible argument and isn't worth answering really. Saying that the lockdowns don't work when there are people actively ignoring them and continuing to have super spreading events isn't proof lockdowns don't work, like wtf kind of argument is that? (Doesn't do thing) "OMG thing doesn't work! Thing is dumb and I'm justified for not doing thing".</p>
<p>The last question is also dumb as they shouldn't be deciding that all eldery are ready to die. If they wish to do that, then maybe. Plus, old folks homes are a shared space with many people and one person wanting to give up or take the risk shouldn't put others at risk. Including staff.</p>

        <p>Listen? We did. When the lockdown happened it was impossible to go anywhere because nothing was open. If you're talking about masks, then you must have forgot that the masks weren't mandated until a month after and about 98% complied so again I don't see how we are at fault. Also, a lot of people on r/NNN do wear masks to avoid confrontation but they openly hate them, so again it's real hard to blame us when we are a tiny minority.</p>

        <p>Idk if you’ve noticed the title of the sub but it’s not fuck the masks and fuck the lockdowns. It’s no new normal as in the great reset these psychopaths are pushing. Some here are fine with masks (not me). Some are fine with lockdowns and restrictions (big majority are not in favor) but most of us don’t own a business that opened up anyways. Us complaining about masks and lockdowns are a place to vent and talk with like minded people. If you want to lock yourself away with a face diaper go right on ahead.</p>

        <p>The country I'm from had an incredibly strict lockdown for about 3 months. The roads were empty, most people weren't working, all schools canceled, and compliance with maskswas extremely high. We paid people to stay home and had public health do contact tracing for every case. It was basically the lockdown that the Americans keep saying they need to eliminate it, but as soon as we started opening things covid started skyrocketing.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are a short term strategy to lower cases and infections. They are not able to totally eliminate covid. A pretty big portion of the population still have to work (basic utilities, industrial stuff), and the spread from these groups, even with masks and distancing, seem to keep the virus alive. As soon as we re open they go up again. There were a few countries that managed to stop it, but they stopped it early and still have lockdowns when one or two cases are found and were a isolationist to begin with. Most countries are long past that.</p>
<p>I don't think it's reasonable to blame this on a tiny portion of the population who were non compliant, and a lot of the people here do comply with measures. I have, and still do, follow all the lockdown and masking measures. I'm just here for some lockdown critical discourse. It's fine to be critical of government response. There's definitely a lot of irrational responses to the virus on policy level.</p>
