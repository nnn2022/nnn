    <p><p>At this studio, you are not required to wear a mask, pants, shoes, shirts or anything else for that matter.</p>
<p>I trust that you will make choices that best align with who you are and that you will have compassion for those that choose differently than you.</p>
<p>Just as before...
Should you choose to not wear a mask, please be mindful and give space to those that do.</p>
<p>Should you choose to wear a mask, please be mindful and give space to those that don't.</p>
<p>We don't know why someone chooses what they do. It is not our business to just assume.</p>
<p>I believe in personal choice and accountability. Remember that each choice we make has a result. Let this be an opportunity for you to check in with you and choose consciously.</p>
<p>Along these same lines, I think it's important that we address the vaccine.
I know that there is a lot of excitiment surrounding the vaccine. I know that this is creating a lot of hope for things to begin to feel a bit more normal and I know how much conversation is surrounding the excitment.</p>
<p>Please remember that while this may be exciting to talk about for some, for others it's actually not something they want to discuss.</p>
<p>Please be mindful of this while you are at the studio by not asking other students or teachers if they have or if they plan to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Please feel free to share your own experience! If you are excited that you have had or are going to have the opportunity to be vaccinated and it is playing a positive role in your life, by all means...feel free to share your experience!</p>
<p>This is not an attempt to shut down all conversation about vaccines. It's playing a huge role in our current situation so of course there will be talk about it! Rather this is just a reminder to share about your own experience and allow others to choose if they would like to share about their own.</p></p>

        <p>I'd like to share (even though I will be downvoted) that I plan on getting the vaccine when it is available. I'm not worried about dying from the coronavirus, I am worried about the cognitive impairment that those who got the virus face. Two of my close friends got the virus, they physically felt a little sick, but they struggled to do simple assignments. Their attention span basically vanished. If I were to face the same consequences, I would certainly fail an entire semester because I am already just barely getting by with my schedule. If getting the vaccine means I won't face this cognitive impairment, then I wouldn't think twice about getting it for that reason alone. I've looked into numbers about side effects from vaccines (VAERS data) and very few people at my age reported any serious symptoms.</p>
