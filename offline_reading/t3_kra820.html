    <strong>Why is obedience seen as a virtue?</strong>
    <p><p>So once upon a time everyone hated the teacher's pet (even teachers). We'd hear 'don't tell tales' - this behaviour was NOT encouraged (disruptive to the herd). Now it seems being obedient, sneaky, conformist and worshipping authority are virtues. Whatever happened to youthful rebellion? So many young people seem so smug and compliant. I came of age in the early noughties and was a very young teen in the late 90s. We were all about being cool, rebellious and having fun. People who mindlessly obeyed authority were looked down on - or certainly not seen as people to emulate. I find all of this conformity disturbing and it's also trickled up to older adults. Many middle aged (usually male) journalists on Twitter seem so pleased with themselves for being virtuous and gaining brownie points from the imaginary online judges. Publications like the Financial Times and the London Times are now insufferably woke and smug. WHY? Journalists used to be truth finders, curious and brave. Now they are total wimps begging to be praised by some ghost teacher. This has also had a knock-on effect on masculinity - so many men are people pleasers which is creepy and weird. And like I said, many are not young anymore so they didn't grow up with that culture. I feel the values of the helicopter parenting generation have taken over the world and brainwashed their elders too.</p></p>

        <p>The imaginary online judges aren’t imaginary. We live in a world where people will dig through ten years of tweets just to find a slightly off-colour joke in order to publicly shame them just for the sake of it. </p>
<p>Social media is as damaging an innovation as the nuclear bomb.</p>

        <p>Good point. I agree. I think social media is more damaging than anyone ever could have envisaged. Revenge effects, if you like. People initially had such hope it would change the world with the Arab Spring. Yet what it's done is bring out the dark side of humanity because as you say, there are real judges there, the crowd is keenly watching, ready to applaud (or not). So people panic, do things for approval, condemn others. Meanwhile, bad actors take advantage (China bots). I honestly think we will rue the day social media reared its ugly head. There's also a theory called 'elite overproduction' which says that too many wannabe elites (with useless degrees) are jostling for position, meaning that oneupmanship and cancelling is the mode du jour in order to gain the upper hand.</p>

        <p>Why has this happened? Why has this behavior been encouraged? For times exactly like this. It’s not an accident. </p>
<p>Take the US for example (it’s happening everywhere but the US has been specifically targeted because it represents a unique obstacle to tyrannical and authoritarian regimes throughout the world (i.e., it’s powerful, it’s wealthy, you can’t ignore it and it represents freedom for billions of people all over the world)). You couldddd try to just take over the country by force in order to eliminate the pesky world superpower that has values and interests that are directly contradictory to authoritarian regimes (something China might want to do for example) but that’s a wildly risky plan for a country with the strongest military and the largest armed militia in the world (gun owners). So, instead, you infiltrate institutions that gradually (and then, one day, suddenly) take away power from the electorate while also encouraging conformist behavior, lack of critical thinking, passivity and obedience. That way, the American people will eventually hand you the country themselves. This has been in the works for decades and it’s not a coincidence. I mean it’s literally China’s stated approach with respect to the US and it’s aided by people and organizations that hate the US (or at least traditional American values) like Alinsky, Soros, Antifa, etc. or have been brainwashed into thinking their fighting for justice (basically everyone at a BLM protest). </p>
<p>I used to think things like the Gillette commercial lecturing men about toxic masculinity were just funny. They’re not. It’s an attack on men for being less agreeable by nature (pulling from Jordan Peterson here) and we certainly can’t have men objecting to those in power. That won’t do. It’s just part of a scheme to make individuals less independent and to undermine traditional American values. </p>
<p>TL;dr - Why? To condition people to go along with a power grab.</p>

        <p>The same reason that kids for the argument that private schools get better job/life opportunities. Because the public school system teaches you not to stand out and not to ask questions and to go along with the pack.</p>
