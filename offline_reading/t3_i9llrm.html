    <strong>I feel like the only way out my pain anymore is by death soon</strong>
    <p><p>I am so distressed I don't see any end to my pain ever at this point. I've been up for almost an entire day now binging on people on Twitter saying the virus is seasonal and will only get worse.  Meaning I don't get to go to college for fall/spring and the restrictions never let up.  This is all I wanted that I worked my entire life for and it's destroyed. This should have been the happiest time of my life.  I have to live in this perpetual state of pain, misery, and suffering for another year. I have nothing and no one to return to at that point. I can't handle living like this anymore and am going to die by the end of the year if this doesn't stop. I've been doing this for six months and it doesn't end.  Everything that gave my life meaning or enjoyment was destroyed. All my friends and relationships were taken.  I think the only answer to end my pain is suicide.</p>
<p>I am hysterical over this.  I cannot possibly live though 12 more months of this. I am going to die and probably soon.  I'm so distressed I have nightmares, headaches, diarrhea, vomiting constantly. I started cutting myself again. I don't care about the laws anymore. I accelerate to fifty in my neighborhood and run stop signs. Why do I follow the laws of this country that's ruined my life and given me nothing?  Once this is over I will have nothing left in my life.  I will not physically be able to make it though these next months.</p></p>

        <p>I get it, because there are days I feel like this and I am old enough to know better. </p>
<p>But here's the thing, if you feel this way - get out and do something instead of self-inflicting wounds or death. </p>
<p>This is being done to us. We need to start doing things back.</p>
<p>Walk down the street with no mask and your head held high.</p>
<p>Have a fucking party and invite your friends.</p>
<p>Walk into your local supermarket and sing at the top of your lungs, "We're not going to take it."</p>
<p>Refuse to take this shit. Resist it wherever possible. You are not to blame, the morons of society are - make them feel your pain.</p>

        <p>I've been where you're at.  It SUCKS.  You are really hurting,  and you deserve care and help.</p>
<p>Take a big deep breath.  There are people who care about you.</p>
<p>Put down the phone.  Take a walk, even a short walk.  Focus on your surroundings (what are three things you can see? Three things you can touch? Etc.)</p>
<p>Then eat a decent meal and maybe some ice cream.  Milk and sugar have calming properties. Listen to music, or take a nap.</p>
<p>You need to replenish your body so you can cope with your mind a little better.  Do you have anyone to talk to?</p>
<p>Please know that how you're feeling right now is not how you will always feel.  There will come a time when all this is in the past.  Hold on.</p>

        <p>I know it seems horrible, but don't do anything rash while you're upset except meditate or go for a walk. We can't predict the future and you may or may not be in school soon, this flip flopping and regulating could go on all winter and spring, but things will slowly turn around eventually. Lots of things could have delayed your schooling, this is just so stressful because you don't agree with it and the media keeps making it worse than it is. Alot of people weren't in a situation to deal with this and the lack of empathy from lockdown doomers is appalling. Delete social media, don't read the news, and go meet up with friends for a hike. If a beach is open near you, seeing all the people crowded around maskless really helps me. It's the not knowing and slow progress that gets stressful, so just wait it out and try be productive in the mean time. Death is for when your body just can't function for you anymore, but I'm sure you still have a lot to offer and you can always try something more to make yourself feel better. Yes, join the resistance. Go out without a mask, you rebel.</p>

        <p>Those people missed out on a lot. Try and reframe your thinking here. Just because life isn't what you thought it would be doesn't mean it's not worth living. This lockdown will eventually pass once the general population gets tired of it or there's a vaccine.</p>
<p>It's not fair that you lost this time, but you've got a whole life ahead of you to make that time up later. </p>
<p>I suggest you look into counseling or pray if you're so inclined. Try and focus on other people and break the negative feedback loop that's going on in your mind.</p>
<p>If you need someone to talk to, feel free to send me a PM. I didn't have the college experience I wanted but I still turned out okay in the end. I can tell you from personal experience it gets better.</p>

        <p>I would rather die than live like this anymore. You don’t seem to understand the economic and social affects that this will ruin my future and the US if this goes on anymore.  There’s no future once this is over.  No one cares about me.</p>
<p>Yes, a life of cutting myself and crying in total isolation compared to having friends and a future is not a life worth living. Sorry. I do go to therapy and it doesn’t help because I’m not sad about anything therapy can fix.  I took three years in community college and had to take a year off for epilepsy. Didn’t even get one full fucking year of college. Not one year.</p>

<p>I’m sure you have more options than you think. Everyone in college is getting sidetracked by this. Lots of people are missing out. Think of generations that came before us. They lived through really hard times in the world wars and the Depression. People with their lives planned out were drafted to war. So many things go wrong. Sometimes they work out. Sometimes the worst thing becomes the reason you grow and you’re grateful after you get through it. Life is funny that way. You can do this.</p>

        <p>Get off twitter #1. Fuck that place. I used Twitter for 10 years even found friends on there and now it's just a bunch of judgmental trash. I love to argue with them sometimes but you shouldn't they're all so stupid. No amount of graphs can convince them otherwise. 
Iv never hated people more then I do right now but that's what we have to fight back. We can get through this. You have to dive in to whatever you like to do hard af rn. Bring back old hobbies even ones from when you were a kid. Bend the rules, keep going out and doing things take off your mask when you can. We need people like you.</p>

        <p>Tbh OP, college is overrated anyway given the Marxist indoctrination they're instilling, which has led to some of these sociopolitical movements involved with the "New Normal" and some of the government mandates involved.</p>
<p>If your college time comes to an end, you'll still be fine. There are trade schools that are open throughout who will teach anyone young and old applicable trades which will make you a lot of money.</p>
<p>Life won't be over because of this lockdown bs. Don't forget that. There is a path forward no matter what.</p>
<p>In the meantime, keep resisting however you can</p>

        <p>Don’t end your life. Don’t let them win. Harness your despair to create change. Form a grass-roots group of young people and write statements to send to governments and universities. Or something. This situation is the pits, but gives you an opportunity to make a difference. Nothing to lose, right? Get creative, step by step.</p>

        <p>Avoid reading too much on the COVID-19 on social media for too long, as that can definitely make the situation seem worse than it is, fueling your despair even more. The media might make you feel hopeless, but please, for your sake, lay off from that particular topic for a few hours or even days until you calm down.</p>

        <p>Same. My childhood was ruined, I barely ever had friends- my dad made everything very hard for me and abused me. I spent the past 3 years living in hotels and shitty shelters thinking- when I get out of this I'm going to college and going to meet people and have real friends.</p>
<p>I literally got a permanent place right when this started. things were looking up now this shit is threatening to unravel my progress and life again.</p>
<p>People will call me snowflake and shit, and I'm very aware this is a 'me' problem but going all the way back to the bottom because of a virus that has a 98 or whatever percent rate of survival feels like a cruel joke. </p>
<p>I feel like I'm getting old and I'll never get to have a normal life now. I feel like my youth was wasted and ruined and this is the nail in the coffin.</p>

        <p>I get your pain.</p>
<p>You feel like  you have nothing left to live for because we have all had hopes and dreams and plans that may never happen again.  </p>
<p>You feel like your pain is being ignored because everyone is too busy amplifying their irrational fear over a virus that won't kill them.  </p>
<p>You feel like you're dying inside because you refuse to put your life on hold because society is telling you to. </p>
<p>I feel the same way - outraged at how this is being carried out and prolonged and how destructive it all is. Everyone sits at home waiting for a vaccine, covering their face with scraps of fabric, acting like they are single handily saving the world, when in actuality they are supporting the destruction. </p>
<p>It is fucked up and nearly impossible to turn a blind eye to the situations that others refuse to acknowledge. It is nearly impossible for others to comprehend that you do not want to accept what we are being spoon-fed. </p>
<p>I don't care about the laws, the arbitrary rules they adjust as they see fit. It's clear bullshit and manipulation, but those of us who see it as such - are the problem?? Yeah, I fucking hate that now I, and anyone else I agree with, are seen as what is wrong with the world.</p>
