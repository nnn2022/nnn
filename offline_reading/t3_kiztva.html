    <strong>More adventures in cashiering</strong>
    <p><p>Encountering an old lady in an aisle who needs help and is also pulling her shirt up over her mouth.</p>
<p>Me: It’s ok you don’t have to do the shirt thing.</p>
<p>Her: I’m sorry I forgot my mask.</p>
<p>Me: Don’t worry about it it’s fine you can drop your shirt.</p>
<p>Her: I have six of them in my car I just forgot it.</p>
<p>Me: That’s fine, no big deal.</p>
<p>Her: I like the masks. I’ve been wearing them for years because I have a cough.</p>
<p>Guy checking out wearing a mask that says “this mask is as useless as our governor”</p>
<p>Me: I appreciate your mask.</p>
<p>Him: Thanks my wife hardly let’s me wear it.</p>
<p>Me: Shes kinda right, shouldn’t have to wear one at all.</p>
<p>Woman checking out. I gotta say I wanted to spout out so many things to this woman but I barely kept it together.</p>
<p>Her: There were two people in here without masks on.</p>
<p>Me: Oh yeah?</p>
<p>Her: You all should really be doing something about it.</p>
<p>Me: Do you have your discount card?</p>
<p>Her: There is a sign on the door that says masks required.</p>
<p>Me: It’s not like it’s a law.</p>
<p>Her: It kinda is.</p>
<p>Me: We can’t physically stop people from doing things. We can’t even stop shoplifters.</p>
<p>Her: Well this is different.</p>
<p>Me: Here is your total, do you have any coupons?</p>
<p>Her: I’m so tired of all this.</p>
<p>Me: Let me get this bagged for ya.</p>
<p>Her: You all need to do better. If not I’ll talk to the manager. </p>
<p>I thanked her as usual and she walked toward the back of the store. I was sure I’d get talked to but never did. I wanted to tell her I was tired of it too but it’s because of people like her. I wanted to tell her if she is uncomfortable then maybe she should stay out of the store. I wanted to tell her that she has more power to approach those people than I do.</p>
<p>I also wanted to scream at her like an insane man about all the things I’ve lost and how masks are a symbol of all of it and that I am forced to wear one just to survive. Not survive the virus. But everyday life with people like her.</p></p>

        <p>Props to you for keeping your composure.  That’s the hypocrisy of these people who think they’re the mask enforcement health force, they continue to go out thinking that they’re the pariah’s of health and safety when “cases are rising” (note how they’ve stopped overplaying the death count) even with masks and other restrictions in place.</p>

        <p>All you grocery store workers, you have my most earnest sympathy and support. The dumb things I hear out of people's mouths while I'm standing in line, and especially the ones trying to argue over why they can't buy all the toilet paper or whatever...would just do my head in.</p>

        <p>My significant other just stares blankly at them when they complain like that. They have a mandatory mask mandate in that town, but it’s unenforceable. The blank stare with long blinks conveys the STFU you all really want to say.</p>
