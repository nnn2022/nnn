    <strong>Online school is not a solution</strong>
    <p><p>I have online school, and it has been an absolute disaster.</p>
<p>I have to stare at a screen for up to eight hours a day and just listen to teachers and do endless assignments. Lecturing was already bad, but online it's even more disengaging and hard to pay attention. I always fidget with other things and go into other tabs because I cannot stay focused. The only time I really try to participate and pay attention is in a few classes I really like.</p>
<p>And things aren't even that bad for me. I am fortunate enough to have my own laptop and my own room, where I can log into classes and do assignments in peace and quiet. But I know that a lot of others don't have fully working computers or quiet spaces where they can do their work. A lot of kids have just been skipping online school altogether. School is supposed to be the "great equalizer" in society, but with online school, more privileged kids who can afford laptops and private tutors will excel while less privileged kids will fall behind.</p>
<p>This cannot go on. Especially considering the fact that the mortality rate for children seems to be getting lower every day and that kids spread the virus a lot less than adults, there is no possible justification to keep schools closed. We can find solutions for teachers, kids, and parents at high risk, but everyone else needs to go back to school now.</p></p>

        <p>every year we keep this charade up, we are raising generations of vegetables that will have no idea how to contribute back to society. When people tell me to be positive, its cause they either went through school already and will never need to go through with this facade of an education they are pumping us or they were basement agoraphobics to begin with.</p>

        <p>And here I thought that school couldn't get any dumber after common core math.</p>
<p>I stand corrected.</p>
