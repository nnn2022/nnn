    <strong>I used to be a Covidiot</strong>
    <p><p>Back in January of 2020, I was terrified 
 of this weird, scary virus that was supposedly killing thousands in China. I was seeing videos of Chinese nurses talking about how deadly it was, how contagious it was, etc. </p>
<p>When the virus was declared a threat to the U.S, I prepared for the worst. I thought if I wasn’t wearing a N95, I’d die. </p>
<p>But quickly, I realized there was nothing I could do about this. </p>
<p>I began to eat healthier, take a multivitamin, and focus on taking care of my body in general. I lost 30 pounds, and felt great. Still overweight (I have a BMI of 28) but I felt and still feel awesome. </p>
<p>I began to put more effort into my job and going the extra mile to line myself for a promotion. I also began to paint, draw, sew and write again.  </p>
<p>Once I realized that the pandemic was way overblown, I realized the bullshit that it was. Why do people get angry if you share official death rates? </p>
<p>I’m so glad I didn’t fully drink the Koolaid. I wear a mask because I have to at work to keep my job, but I only carry one outside unless it’s crowded (where I live, you can get a $2000 fine for being caught maskless). </p>
<p>I go on jogs with my dog, and he seems to be totally fine during this pandemic, haha. </p>
<p>By the way, I got a promoted to manager whilst all these fear mongering doomers are at home, ordering Uber eats, and watching Netflix whilst raking in the government money. </p>
<p>As far as the vaccine, my in laws are trying to convince me to get it. It seems during the pandemic, people have forgotten that the government doesn’t always act in the right interest of the people. I’m not against people choosing to get it, but I personally am worried about possible long term effects that would not be clear until later. </p>
<p>There’s no way I’m getting an experimental vaccine that’s not FDA approved, especially when I can’t afford to be out of work for three weeks (that happened to two people where I work). </p>
<p>I’m not generally AntiVax (I took most of the run of the mill, “dead bug” shots as a kid). I have a scar from my smallpox vaccination, and to me it’s a little mark from the country I was born in. </p>
<p>It’s just, these vaccines, are not normal vaccines, and if I don’t need to take one, why would I? I don’t take flu shots personally, and I haven’t gotten the flu since I was 11 (almost 10 years ago). I get colds every three years or so. </p>
<p>So why would I get a shot for something I’ve definitely been exposed to by the nature of my work, but somehow has not gotten yet. </p>
<p>Living in fear is no way to live!</p></p>

        <p>I think there was nothing wrong with taking this seriously at the begining, because (unlike now) we didn't know what was happening and it could have really been a deadly pandemic.</p>

        <p>You're supposed to change your views when new information comes to light. Too bad the government doesn't do this and instead doubles down because it's afraid to admit it fucked up. Or more likely it knew from the beginning and this whole farce is meant to control people and rake in billions for vaccine companies.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I was legit terrified from the shit I was seeing coming out of China. Videos of bodies piled up in hospital hallways, people being locked inside their homes by the government. But, after a couple months it was clear that it was mostly propaganda.</p>

        <p>I started out on r/wuhan_flu and was actually concerned in the beginning. But that was because well it was new and stuff wasnt really known about it yet. But as information came to light and everything that happened last year with BLM and everything my eyes were open. I haven't worn a mask at all the past 8 months, even at work. my life is completely back to normal now.</p>

        <p>I had gotten sick in December '19 and was worried for a while that I'd get sick again with an even worse virus.</p>
<p>Then the list of symptoms came out and I did research on the common cold and realized I'd already had the shit and it wasn't a big scary virus at all. I had H1N1 during that pandemic and while I was miserably sick I survived. Covid was a joke, I worked 10+ hour days the whole time I had it.</p>

        <p>Thank you for being forthcoming. Sadly many Covidiots are just doubling down rather than admit they were wrong on the topic.</p>
<p>No shame in being wrong, especially when you have no information, and in the beginning none of us did.  Unfortunately by around April of 2020 it was pretty obvious that this was largely a dud overhyped by the media and governments.</p>
<p>Look around.  Observe.  There really is no pandemic except in people's minds.</p>

        <p>Yeah if it's a deadly virus how comes restaurant food is considered essential? 🙄 and the rest just security theater. If you see security theater not even the people implementing it think this virus is serious. And why wear a N95? Just carry an oxygen tank.</p>
