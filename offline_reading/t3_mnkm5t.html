    <strong>Why is it that the majority of people I know that question the benefits of masks and lockdowns still blindly are lining up for the vaccine??</strong>
    <p><p>Brief rant but this is just baffling to me... The majority of people I know are pretty conservative and a lot of them will usually question the benefits of masks and lockdowns and talk about how we need to wake up to the tyranny of the government. However, when it comes to getting a brand new experimental vaccine, nearly everyone seems to have a favorable view on it and are at best, neutral on getting it. </p>
<p>The worst part is when I ask any of these people what they know about the vaccines, they admit they know next to nothing about any of them. They just think it is something that has been thoroughly tested and daddy government would never approve of something that was potentially dangerous for us. The disconnect is completely unreal...</p>
<p>Why you wouldn’t want to spend even a brief amount of time researching what they are injecting directly into your body is beyond me. Also, all of the antivaxxer hate on social media and mainstream news that seemed to explode out of nowhere years ago sure makes a lot of sense now.</p></p>

        <p>no idea why they are willing to follow the riskiest and most invasive “guideline” over the others.</p>
<p>it’s probably because they’ve been suckered by the “anti-vax” argument.</p>
<p>idk why people care if other people view them as anti vax or not.</p>
<p>that’s the line many people won’t cross for whatever reason.</p>

        <p>Look at how the arguments develop between skeptics and believers. After you show them the numbers that should convince them, they then want you to be a psychologist. "why would they lie?" It's like nothing can be true unless you prove motivation also.</p>
<p>Additionally, there's safety in numbers. Humans can accept doing anything if enough are doing it with them.</p>

        <p>It's unnerving but the older ones don't adjust to targeted campaigns and the younger suffer overexposure so once the trends picked up they forgot the technical warnings they may have glanced at last year.  It got tiresome explaining why dissenting virologists and immunologists were correct, frankly.  Doctors are not as smart and kindly as they would like people to believe.  The tiktok nurses and empty hospital videos didn't affect the majority.  Neither are the photos of the detention camps (we don't have footage yet of the larger suspected sites).</p>
<p>There is little outcry about the curfew.  We are waiting.  Remember, the monsters are IMMUNE to securement in the Hague.</p>

        <p>The greatest trick the media pulled was to put opposition to the COVID vaccines into the same basket as the tantrum-throwing anti-vaxxers. I have a problem with the new vaccines and yet I will update two other vaccines this year, because it is time to do so. In general, vaccines are a good thing and hysteria about them only arise, because people have forgotten how rotten certain diseases really are/were. The same way, western societies forgot how rotten famines, poverty and war really are/were. </p>
<p>The world has gotten so complex, that it is virtually impossible to be even half-way informed about things concerning you (and only you) and being a functional individual. If you have a family, you might just dig a hole and hide in it. Past problems created the institutions that everyone relies on to keep an eye on things, from the FDA to the CARB to OSHA, but most people fail to accept that there are forces that undermine not just the trust in these institutions, but also the ability of these institutions to function properly. Now you have vaccines with an emergency approval, a manufacturer without liability and no duty of that manufacturer to release all the information and studies they have and did. And even then, history tells us that corporations lie through their teeth at every occasion, because the worst case is a fine. Thus complying with the law is just a business decision.</p>
