    <strong>Organizing against the new normal</strong>
    <p><p>Right, let's organize. There is so much energy in the anti-lockdown space, it's time to harness it &amp; direct it to effective change. We have an incredibly broad &amp; exciting coalition forming, bringing so many different sides together, there's a real opportunity for change.</p>
<p>I have some ideas on what we could do, but I'm just some guy. A guy whose got a ton of organizing experience, but still just some guy. We need to share ideas on how to move forward and get our rights back.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My feelings are our priorities should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundraising - I want to find local businesses who make masks, and get some custom designs done, with super thin &amp; organic cotton or bamboo. Getting donations to pay for things like phonebanking. We would need someone who can do oversight of the funds to make sure no funny business is at play.</li>
<li>Organizing days of resistance - Imagine if just 10% of people in the supermarket were wearing "no new normal" masks? We don't need to reach 50% support, this thing falls apart when 20% of people make a noise.</li>
<li>Keeping it professional - I want to run a respectful workspace, feedback &amp; criticism in good faith is always acknowledged, but any form of name calling, bullying or negativity is completely unwelcome. We're going to end up working with people who are very far from us politically, we need to focus on finding ways to really get along with each other.</li>
<li>Phonebanking - gathering phone numbers, calling supporters, begging for money, training people in passive resistance.</li>
<li>Website - can anyone knock up a quick &amp; dirty site, with a Wix (or similar) shop site?</li>
<li>Organizing protests and days of resistance - supporting people to stand up, sometimes alone and being counted.</li>
<li>Growing the movement - Welcoming new members, encouraging the fearful to join us. The gate has to be wide open, come on in!</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A little bit about me, I put in 1000's of hours organizing for Bernie Sanders, I was really, really good at it &amp; got some great results. I thought that union work would be a good follow up, I was volunteering with a local union, but noped out when the route to paid employment involved organizing for Biden, which was an idea which made me feel kinda sick. I want to work with people of all political types, to get the changes we need.</p>
<p>I have created some workspaces, avoiding big tech (because they cannot be trusted) and which use encryption. DM me if you want to be involved, a little about yourself would be really helpful.</p>
<p>Post your ideas, thoughts, criticisms. All the above is just a starting point &amp; totally open to development.</p></p>

        <p>This might not be a popular idea, but it is absolutely true, the first thing we have to establish is that we WILL NOT BE DIVIDED, and that there are more of us than them.</p>
<p>This means we need our "bat signal" so to speak so we can have visibility to each other without announcing, and then spring at the same co-ordinated time.</p>

        <p>Non-compliance is the means, the return to normality is the goal. We've been working our whole lives, makes no sense to work for something you don't have to. There is literally no work in non compliance. I'm tired of people trying to "harness" other peoples passion. People are not work horses. You're definitely going about this the wrong way.</p>

<p>Exactly. How are we going to do that? Is it by shouting and swearing at someone who's on your side? Maybe there's a more effective way. You &amp; me agree on a lot, let's find out what those things are.</p>

<p>Yes. Non-disruptive forms of protest do nothing to achieve the common goal. Noncompliance is the only “nonviolent” way to disrupt the “new status quo”. Many people realize that- and are mostly ready to ~~burn it all down~~ accelerate.</p>

        <p>I hate to say it but this guy is right. You’ve got the right idea, but nothing short of mass, blatant non-compliance is going to stop these governors and politicians.</p>
<p>They are <em>completely</em> tyrannical. They have shown that they have no problem <em>destroying</em> those who disagree with them. They would think your ideas are cute, and are not a threat.</p>

        <p>Hello. I have a few thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Community organization and protesting is necessary, obviously some people need to be working on it yet there already are people doing this and they don't seem to be getting any results. Probably because nobody is getting any meaningful media coverage and the public views it as a fringe lunatic movement. So, I don't mean to discourage you from doing this, but I don't see there being alot of of bang for your buck with this approach. If you really are really good at this, though, then I'm sure it will do some good. </li>
<li>I'd be able to do your tech for you if you're interested but I'd want to see what your concrete ideas are first. I also already have a website for this which I can DM to you if you'd like. I might be willing to let you use if for your purposes or transfer it to you as a starting point if we can build up some trust first, because I am not at all experienced in community organization and it might make more sense for someone who is experienced to take over. </li>
<li>I like the idea of the no new normal masks except for the mask part. I think that a campaign for a wearable symbol like this is going to be absolutely necessary so that we can directly address the group-think psychology of the situation (and I don't see this going anywhere unless this is done). My own idea for a similar campaign is shown by this image https://i.redd.it/jxnno9gzn6661.jpg (despite the goofy image, I also have a serious write-up explaining why and how I think this would work). This is where I think we can make the most headway for the least effort investment.</li>

        <p>I agree on most of it but not on the designer masks bit. I have never spent money on a mask and don't plan to now.</p>
<p>If you are in California, I highly suggest getting involved with the recall Newsom petition campaign! Yeah, it's mostly Republicans, but who cares: if Newsom gets recalled now, everyone will know the reason was his fascist lockdowns. </p>
<p>Someone else suggested a legal defense fund for businesses to defy the "mandates" and open up, I think that is also a great idea</p>
<p>I saw a recent post in a "Reopen" Facebook group about getting together a bunch of people to all go into a store at the same time without any masks on</p>
<p>There's a protest at Pfizer's NYC headquarters at 11am, January 13th. 235 East 42nd St. (Found thru "Liberate New York" Facebook group) Head over there if you're anywhere near, wear every bit of your Bernie gear</p>

        <p>You lost me at No New Normal Masks. All we have to do is have genuine conversations with people on the fence, preferably in person WITHOUT a mask. It's fine if they wear one but you should NOT, it defeats the purpose of "No New Normal". Plus with your history as a Bernie supporter I question your intentions. Not to mention politics is a sham in of itself so bringing your experience of participating in shams will only ruin this organic movement/awakening. Honestly all we have to do is wait. People are indeed waking up all we have to do is let them. It's becoming more obvious by the day. This sub grows by the hundreds each day and it keeps increasing. I appreciate your enthusiasm in trying to move things forward but some of the things you're suggesting seems counter productive honestly. Ultimate for sure solution is individual non compliance, it's the only thing we (as individuals) have complete control over.</p>
