        <p>“We’re just asking people to wear masks, wash their hands and social distance”</p>
<p>No, people all over the world are being forced to lock themselves at home and stay there until they’re pushed into poverty. Then turn everything half way back to normal, so you still can’t get a job but now you can’t claim any support either.</p>

        <p>Yes, you hit it right on the nose.</p>
<p>And it's like, the comments from other people aren't begging people to wear masks and wash hands, they are demanding people just stay home altogether, and shame people for, you know, doing normal things, going about their day, etc.</p>
<p>Where I'm at, I see people complying with these orders. Everyone is wearing masks now, especially indoors. I have to wait in small lines in the bathroom at times to wait for an available sink to wash my hands now. People stand far apart. Not good enough, apparently. PA is "surging" with cases, and we are chastized as being "bad children" for "not obeying".</p>

        <p>There's no such thing as "just social distance". That mandate alone brings unimaginable despair, loneliness, and misery.</p>

        <p>There are people who unquestioningly do whatever their government masters tell them - liberals I call them but I think with this mask nonsense it's catching a lot of otherwise reasonable people too.</p>
<p>Problem is they've made it so YOU WILL COMPLY OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR BUSINESS! which is a tough trap to get out of.</p>

        <p>Found this on Facebook, with comments concuring that people stepping one foot outside their homes were idiots, assholes, deserved to die, etc. I wish I was kidding. These people were advocating for welding people into homes to prevent the spread, too... Anyway...</p>
<p>Choice bits:</p>
<p>&rt; here is frustration and concern in Broward County that if the coronavirus outbreak continues down this path, there may need to be a countywide shutdown.</p>
<p>&rt; “We are running out of [hospital] bed space because all of these stupid people who insist it’s nothing worst than the flu are wrong,” said Steve Geller, a commissioner and the county’s vice mayor. “The flu doesn’t fill our intensive-care units.”</p>
<p>It doesn't? Because I've heard that the flu does fill ICU in hospitals during flu season. Moving on...</p>
<p>&rt; Those are harsh words from a local leader who is trying to avoid a shutdown.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; ICU bed capacity at Memorial West Hospital in Pembroke Pines is at 180 percent.</p>
<p>&rt; Is it time to shut Broward down like in the early days of the outbreak?</p>
<p>&rt; “It looks grave from where we are,” Mayor Dale Holness said. “We have to look at two measures — are the measures we are taking working ... two, if the hospitalization gets worse, we are gonna have to shut down. But as of today, I wouldn’t say shut down.”</p>
<p>&rt; The mayor says the health department has told him that 80 percent of the cases spread within families and at gatherings.</p>
<p>So he admits that places like restaurants and bars are not the major spreading point, eh? Interesting. </p>
<p>&rt; “BSO had 1,100 calls [about] house parties since March,” Holness said. “1100 calls! That’s out of this world.”</p>
<p>&rt; Geller added that he’s “angry because I am trying to prevent shutting down the businesses, which would be devastating. If we shut down the business community again, a lot of those businesses will never reopen.”</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; The mayor has asked cities to stop issuing warnings and to issue citations.</p>
<p>&rt; Another commissioner, Dr. Barbara Sharief, said the county may need to take steps like Miami-Dade did, banning indoor restaurant dining and implementing a stricter curfew.</p>
<p>So they admit that there's little community spread, and it is mostly spreading within close quarters like in homes between family members, and at parties, but they still want to shutdown businesses like restaurants?</p>
<p>&rt; “We can go and legislate and put whatever we want on paper,” she said. “The reality is, until people decide they want to take personal responsibility for what’s going on, were never going to be able to accomplish what we need to accomplish.”</p>
<p>&rt; Said Geller: “We are just telling them to wear a mask, social distance and wash your hands with soap and water. And that seems too much for some people. And it’s killing others. So, yeah, I’m a little angry about that.”</p>

<p>Can you share some data?</p>
<p>&rt;So they admit that there's little community spread, and it is mostly spreading within close quarters like in homes between family members, and at parties, but they still want to shutdown businesses like restaurants?</p>
<p>The goal is to get the r value back down under 1. Closing down indoor dining helps a little, and a little is better than zero. If people stopped having house parties, then it would be possible to get under 1 without having to close businesses. But as it stands now, states like Florida are back into exponential growth of infection rates. Like literally every day a new record is being broken.</p>
<p>There's a great visualization of the different interventions and how they impact infection rates and ICU utilization at: https://ncase.me/covid-19/</p>

<p>What good is working if your customers are literally dying and your employees get sick and have to shut down?</p>
<p>The private restaurant in my neighborhood closed after an employee was sick. When they reopened, nobody was wearing a mask still. I’m literally never going there again. Survival of the smartest nowadays</p>

<p>I remember how <a href="https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1282743622312566785?s=20">this video</a> from CNN, no less, was attacked on Twitter even though this is an expert attempting to assure people that Florida is not in the danger the media and politicians claim it to be in. People seem to want to panic, and continue perpetuating that this virus is going to "kill millions", because they are being irrational and seem to enjoy being spoonfed fear (and government money, too, I guess).</p>

        <p>I love the people who claim they had Coronavirus. Had mild symptoms, to boot. But then also claim that <strong>everyone else who'll catch it will die</strong>, that there'll be millions dead, which is basically what that comment you wrote originally stated before it got removed.</p>

        <p>Your original comment stated that there was no point in keeping any business open because of all the dead bodies, and employees falling ill (implying this is happening in the thousands or millions) in Florida.</p>

        <p>I've run into this quite frequently. It makes no sense. </p>
<p>Like this guy at /r/conspiracy would scream about how millions will die, that everyone who gets COVID dies or gets permanent damage, yadda yadda, but he would also claim that he and his wife got it. Obviously, nothing happened to them, and he never said he had damage of any kind. Yet he would harp on the "consequences" of the virus, and warned people of how dangerous it is. It makes no real sense, either these people are just oblivious to their own cause (aka the virus is mostly benign to most), or they are just so brainwashed by the media and the government that they make contradictory claims. Maybe both?</p>

        <p>Like I said, feels like they want to have their cake and eat it too. They want to continue spreading fear, and in their own stupid way, "protect people from the virus" by talking about millions of dead bodies and whatever. But they also seek the victimhood and sympathies from others, because people do coo and caw over "victims of COVID". That, and they are also parroting the narrative that others like the media, government, and peers are regurgitating a ton lately.</p>

        <p>If you actually lived in Florida you would see businesses are not doing well even when they are open. Why? Because people our elderly population is scared to go shopping for frivolous things here. </p>
<p>I guess you just want businesses open regardless of any outside situation. So, no more closing during fires, or tornados, or mass shootings.</p>
<p>Also, have you guys signed you hospital care waiver? So you don’t waste our resources on this whole “hoax” right?</p>

        <p>Businesses don't close during flu season or cold season. I'm in Texas, people on reddit complain that people won't patronize businesses even if they're open. I would be more than willing to shop locally, except most places are either closed or have so many restrictions as to make the experience not worth the unpleasantness. Comparing closing due to a natural disaster to corona is a galaxy brain take. </p>
<p>Walmart is open though. So are the grocery stores, and they're packed every day so don't give me that nonsense that people are afraid to shop.</p>
<p>Do you happen to have those waivers? I want to make sure I have the correct one for my state. I don't have insurance anyway, so I wouldn't want to take on a lifetime of debt for the sniffles.</p>
