    <strong>How do you respond to parents telling you “nothing has changed, be happy, get over it?”</strong>
    <p><p>Today I talked to my parents about my true levels of anger regarding lockdowns. Mom told me, “if there’s anyone who deserves those consequences, it’s you. Despite ALL your skills you’ve done nothing with your life. Stop being negative, &amp; start turning negatives into positives.” Oh yeah right... ignore the fact that loneliness that YOU have enforced on me makes it hard for me to get the motivation to do stuff. It was YOU who banned me from Tinder, which I was using to relieve my loneliness, because it’s “too dangerous” &amp; “you’ll catch COVID if you have it!” It was YOU who forced me out of the gym in January &amp; said, “if you catch COVID &amp; kill us, you’re to blame.” And YOU who used that line over &amp; over again throughout the winter &amp; spring. It is ALWAYS YOU who makes me never leave my own neighbourhood because “people are violent &amp; crazy.” Fuck you.</p>
<p>And Dad, “Nothing’s changed! You didn’t go for dances, you didn’t go for parties, you didn’t go to clubs, you didn’t meet up with friends, you didn’t go to stores, NOTHING’S CHANGED! WHY ARE YOU MAD? Your little brother’s in heaven, &amp; we like saving money &amp; WFH!” I told Dad that I had hope to rejuvenate my social life &amp; now it’s all gone, forever, and he told me, “Stop with the what if’s &amp; work with what is!” My life was inceldom that left me suicidal for a decade &amp; has brought me to the brink a few times during lockdowns. I wanted to change it; I didn’t want more of the same. But no, I should be happy with more of the same because it’s SOOOOOO EASYYYYYYYY. Fuck you too.</p>
<p>Ok my family is beyond fucking saving. According to them I’ve lost NOTHING and even have something to gain. I’ve lost my hope. Hope that I’ll ever be able to meet a beautiful girl that I love, hug a friend, or even just leave my neighbourhood. Hope that I can ever see another person’s face. Now all that’s left is hard reality &amp; knowing that it’s over, it’s gonna keep getting worse, &amp; the rest of eternity for me will be absolute hell. I don’t want to be lonely for the rest of my life, but that’s what it’s looking like. And these idiots expect me to be OK with it. My parents want to be shut ins for the rest of their lives &amp; want the same for me. They’re even laughing about it. Fuck these unempathetic pieces of shit. Rescue me. I wish there was a way I could kill my soul that wouldn’t result in eternal hell. I don’t want to exist anymore.</p></p>

        <p>To dad, that does not matter if you don’t act on it. The only thing that matters to him is what you DO. He knows this is human psychology: he told me, “if the government made laws to prevent everybody from walking outside, suddenly everybody would be walking outside.” He thinks It helps me because he knows I tend to brew on past regrets &amp; past events, but in the context of the situation it just makes me feel worse.</p>
<p>To him, it’s like, “you didn’t make those choices. Still nothing changes.”</p>

        <p>Yes, but he’s using a fallacy against you. When and if you choose to do these things they are no longer available. Everyone has the right to live at their own pace and not be pushed, unless the pushing is positive which it doesn’t sound like it is. I’m guilty of because my hard on my boys at times, I do this out of fear for their future I believe, but we talk about it and if I’m wrong I apologize. For him to simply say well, you don’t do them anyways is a fallacy. There is truth to well,  if you say this people will do the opposite, I think that proves that humans don’t like being told what to do and pushed around. We like to come to our own conclusions, not to say the outdoor example would probably be better for us all.</p>

        <p>They do yet me &amp; my brother are called &amp; treated like the insane ones. Suggested therapy to them multiple times &amp; they’ve said no every time because “nothing is wrong with them.” Are even against me getting therapy because “it’s just you giving money to talk to people when you can get advice from us for free.” What they leave out is that advice is basically “stay in the inner circles we approve of for you, everyone in the outside is out to get you &amp; will get you, so don’t bother with them.”</p>
<p>I have Asperger’s so I’m really vulnerable to manipulation, so it kind of makes sense, &amp; it feels like it makes sense in these hard times now. But I know I’ve been robbed of a lot of amazing opportunities in my high school &amp; university years because of this mentality... opportunities that might never come back now. And it’s not just them... thanks to some brutal bullying experiences in school growing up I carried it myself for a long time. They’re not cultists, just third world immigrants who kept a small circle of friends who they grew up with &amp; think just like them &amp; they say everyone else used them &amp; dumped them at the first sign of trouble/inconvenience. And wouldn’t you guess it... those friends’ kids used to pick on me all the damn time, led by my narcissistic POS of a cousin.</p>
<p>I know I have to get outta here. But I don’t know where I’d run to because every time I tell my parents about a different city/country, they list all the problems with it &amp; basically turn it into some crime ridden ghetto where I’ll be robbed &amp; beaten to death 24/7. They INSIST that toronto Canada is some sort of heaven on earth but I know in my gut it’s bullshit.</p>

        <p>Yeah...that's what parents do when they're controlling pieces of shit. They try to make you think the world is this scaaaaary place that will kill you if they aren't around to "protect" you. In my dad's case it was gender based manipulation: "don't go out to clubs you'll get raped, don't go to buy a car without me because the salespeople see females as easier to take advantage of" etc etc, but really it's the same bullshit. You do not have to listen! Don't talk to them about your plans, just do your own research on where you want to live (people on this sub can help with advice on which places are more normal), make a plan and go. I know it's not easy right now to get the money to get away from your parents, but please, keep trying. I and others here are rooting for you.</p>

        <p>Ok, I'm going to be blunt here: ARE your parents preventing you from going on Tinder, going to the gym etc, or just telling you that you shouldn't?</p>
<p>You have the power, right now, to tune out your idiot asshole parents and do what you want with your own life. Maybe not 100%, for instance if gyms in your area are still closed due to lockdowns, or if your friends are also doomers and don't want to hang out, but here's some things you can do right now:</p>
<p>Go on Tinder. Go to the gym. Go to the park and shoot hoops. Look for in person social events nearby via the meetup app, and go to them. Join a local anti-lockdown Facebook group. See if you can get recs for local resources like underground parties and anti-lockdown therapists. Hang out with old friends. Make new friends by getting the numbers of people you meet at group events. Look for a job so you can get the hell out of your parents' house asap.</p>

        <p>They’re just telling me I shouldn’t, but they word it so powerfully &amp; emotionally, with such legendary guilt tripping skills &amp; ability to gaslight me into thinking they’re being logically while I’m just being an oversensitive, whiny, emotional female dog, that it’s basically prevention. Like I can still go as long as I don’t get caught. So I’m prevented, but they’re not monitoring me for it. Gyms are closed for the foreseeable future, &amp; have been closed since November.</p>

        <p>I know, but that’s just it. My birth givers are a mere microcosm of the society I live in. 99% of people think like this, &amp; it’s just gonna keep getting worse. I fear I’ll never be able to make proper friends or meet a kind girl, &amp; that I’ll have to spend the rest of my life being a lonely incel off the grid fending off hordes of NPC’s trying to kill me. Everyone else suddenly becomes relevant when they’re all trying to ruin your life and kill you, which I believe the majority of NPC sheep feel like doing to us now. Cancel culture already conditioned them to do it pre-lockdowns; “coronavirus” just gives them another excuse. From what I’ve seen when walking outside, and how I’ve seen most people act, if you’re not wearing a mask 24/7 you’re basically a disease vector. I wish I could move to a likeminded community &amp; never look back but how would we really defend, protect, &amp; provide for ourselves?</p>
<p>Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if antimaskers &amp; other dissidents against the mainstream globalist narrative are executed en masse by this time next year, &amp; it being lauded as a good thing. I wouldn’t be surprised if the potential girls I sought to fuck/friends I sought to make, or even friends I know, or even my own family, would be the executioners. It wouldn’t be surprising, but it would definitely be overwhelmingly heartbreaking. It’s probably gonna happen like that... my parents are going to execute me publicly for going against the narrative because I will be listed as an “enemy of the state” once the globalists reveal my identity as sort of a public “kill list”, &amp; they will be cheered for doing so. To twist the knife further, it will probably happen on my 25th birthday (next November).</p>
