    <strong>infinite loop</strong>
    <p><p>As long as we've got the deaths we've got the lockdowns. As long as we've got the lockdowns we've got the deaths. This is really the future that humanity has chosen? Fuck me. After 12 years of school people's brains are just soggy cardboard.</p></p>

        <p>Its the cases not the deaths. Some places with heavy lockdowns have had no deaths in months, or minimal at the very least. It is a case-demic and it is sicking they are using the illusion of fear to propagate fear to the vulnerable. World Wars started because of shit like this</p>

        <p>It's more pernicious than that. PCR testing (notably, the false positive rate exceeds the probable incidence of the virus) has been used all along to attribute all the deaths to covid when there's actually no evidence that any of them have been driven by covid. The deaths are absolutely present and that's always been the defense of the policies. If the mortality rate were obviously 0% they would never have been able to make an argument. It's a mistake to assume that lockdowns haven't killed people or that they did at one point and don't anymore. It's an ongoing feedback loop that by definition has no end.</p>

        <p>Do people who tested positive have to wear masks after quarantine? They had it. Theyâ€™re done, right? Tag and release. All these cases they list daily, those are survivors.</p>

        <p>They've already bypassed that with the spurious claim that infection doesn't confer immunity. Somehow the vaccine does according to the bullshit, they rely on blind faith in authority establishing this as a truth which is a pretty safe assumption for them in general.</p>
