        <p>I honestly wonder if this is what happened to my mother who was put on a ventilator in Maryland in May 2020.</p>
<p>Hopefully the lawyer I contacted will be able to drill down to whether this happened.</p>

        <p>“‘The very first day [at Elmhurst] I was shocked. It was something I’ve never seen before,’ she said. ‘Patients were alone in the rooms on ventilators [with] no family allowed in [to advocate for them]. People were just dying from gross negligence, medical malpractice, [and] mismanagement.’…”</p>
<p>This is a terrifyingly accurate description of my dad’s experience hospitalized with Covid(April 2019, Austin TX). They put him on a vent, tied him to his bed by his ankles and wrists, all alone for 20+ days. His medical team would come in only when they absolutely had to, often completely ignoring him when he would wake up, alone, disoriented and scared crying for help. </p>
<p>My dad survived, thank god!! His long lasting side effect from the Covid virus is PTSD from his time in the hospital. His experience is largely why I feel the way I do towards Covid mandates. They have caused my family way more harm than good.</p>
