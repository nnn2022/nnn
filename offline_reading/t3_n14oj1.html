    <strong>I am still baffled that people can't see how restrictions can cause depression</strong>
    <p><p>I have tried to say on a few subreddits aside from this one how this whole restriction thing affected my mental health. If you read my posts before you probably know I got kicked off of subreddits like offmychest and depressed for speaking against the restrictions.</p>
<p>Having to be masked up and distant from people can cause depression. Especially if you are person who enjoys human interactions. I mean what's the point for people to live if they don't enjoy their lives? The whole "Oh you're keeping someone else alive by following the restrictions" thing is bullshit. The online video chat is such a tease too. You get to see someone's face, but you can't be near them in person. We are told that the only way for us to interact with people in a "healthy way" is to either wear a mask, be more than 6 feet or look at them from a computer screen is bullshit.</p>
<p>People should be allowed to feel the way we feel! Why can't we tell someone how we feel about the restrictions without being judged, censored or ridiculed. What's so wrong telling people you are unhappy you aren't enjoying life right now? Because all the sudden our lives are now meant to be so focused on <strong>OTHER PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND SAFETY RATHER THAN OUR OWN</strong>? If I am following the restrictions it's <strong>BECAUSE I KNOW THE PERSON WHO I AM VISITING IS HIGH RISK</strong>. Want me to wear a mask when I visit the hospital? Fine you know what that's a scenario I wouldn't argue against because it just makes sense. You go to a hospital and anyone who's there is actually sick or injured. <strong>WHY IS IT WHEN ALL I WANT TO DO IS GO SEE A MOVIE, GO OUT TO DINNER, GO TO A BAR, GO OUT DANCING, ETC. THAT I HAVE TO WORRY THAT MY PRESENCE THERE MAY PUT SOMEONE IN THE HOSPITAL JUST FOR SHOWING UP WITHOUT A MASK.</strong></p>
<p>The thing I hear the most if you try to say you're exempt from wearing a mask is <strong>YOU SHOULDN'T BE THERE IF YOU ARE "UNHEALTHY" TO WEAR A MASK</strong>. Huh? <strong>SHOULDN'T THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK FOR COVID BE THE ONES STAYING HOME?</strong> What really made me skeptical about the whole mask thing to begin with was when they said that "You are wearing it to protect others, but not yourself." What do you mean? If masks do in fact work they should be blocking my germs <strong>AND BE PROTECTING MYSELF BECAUSE IT'S OVER MY FACE</strong>.</p>
<p>I just don't think people see the big picture of what the restrictions can do to someone's mental health. That or they gave up their mental health to listen what the government says and not get in trouble. Staying distant from people not only hurts businesses, but is not a normal way to interact with someone if your to scared they might get close to you. It's not normal to be trying to have a human conversation with someone and you can't read their facial expression because of the mask. It's not normal for someone to be to scared to hang out with their friend or relative just because they decided for themselves not to get vaccinated. All of this can seriously damage someone's mental health who has gotten used to how society worked before. For some that can adapt to it fine, but for others it's not so easy even after a year of it.</p></p>

        <p>that is the only reason they are applying restrictions. close business that employ people.</p>

        <p>You keep talking about it! Doomers don't want to acknowledge all the harm their compliance is doing to others, but I think you'll find that people in this sub understand and agree with you. Forcing social animals like humans to stay apart is guaranteed to cause depression. </p>
<p>If the people around you can't hear that your depression is being caused by the government mandates, it says nothing about you and everything about them. You know what you are feeling, and you know why. </p>
<p>I encourage you to try to find places where people are unmasked! Small parks are usually places where I see lots of people acting normal. Maybe there's one near you? It does wonders for my spirit when I can get around people who aren't acting like clowns in their masks.</p>
<p>And find places like this where people understand. I can't speak for everybody here but I for one do understand. You're right, none of this "new normal" stuff is easy or good or human.</p>

        <p>This is no life. I am disabled and on the autistic spectrum and depended on groups to have some social interaction. They have taken all the joy out of life. This is a time I really needed some close LOCAL friends. I have thought about moving because I can't make friends here for years [unlike a town I lived in 15 years ago] However at least I had casual people friends and acquaintances to talk to and group members and used to go to stamp club, art classes, liberal church, and now there's nothing. I haven't had a real conversation in person except with my husband in one and half years. A few church members I saw them in masks for a few minutes outside. That's it.  They have destroyed our lives.</p>

        <p>Thank you. Check out other post I put up too just now, the new one. I do need some change. I do not know what to do now. I think I may have to practice Buddhist acceptance. Be happy I am married and that relationship is good and give up on having friends and any real connections. For whatever reason it is not in the cards for me. I give up. I am so disappointed by people lately, if I shared my feelings, the acquaintanceships/casual connections would be toast anyhow outside of the few exceptions I can be real with.</p>

        <p>I think it’s because many people are short sighted, selfish and have little experience of the world. They therefore have no concept of the wide ranging effects and how they will affect other people.</p>

        <p>It’s like the government and the corporate media are doing everything they can to make everyone as miserable as possible. I’ve taken to calling the lockdowns “state-mandated depression” since that’s basically what it is at this point. Remove all social interaction, and when social interaction is allowed make everyone wear a mask and stat far apart so that you’re constantly reminded that “it’s not safe,” make everyone afraid by showing them nothing but doomsday propaganda for a year straight, discourage people from being active, exercising, or doing anything meaningful with their lives, and that’s enough to make anyone depressed. At a certain point, all the messaging surrounding the virus isn’t to inform, it’s just to scare you into following these meaningless restrictions</p>

        <p>Yes.  The restrictions have a negative impact on normal people's mental health.</p>
<p>But the majority of Reddit are like Jeffrey Toobin and love lockdowns as they allow nearly (as Jeff found out) unlimited opportunity for masturbation and drug abuse.</p>

        <p>That’s odd. Although I will agree with you that although this is an acknowledged issue, no one seems to care/is doing anything about it.</p>

        <p>I once said basically the same thing on my school's subreddit, that this online stuff is depressing as hell and I'm probably gonna need to take another semester because of it. Then I had the <em>audacity</em> to say that the school should reopen once we vaccinate the elderly/high-risk. Everybody flipped out and called me entitled and "melodramatic". Please.</p>

        <p>Because people in the covid cult feel that only people with covid can say they're suffering.  No one else's pain or death matters to them unless its covid related. Its awful trying to tell people you're having a hard time and all they say is,  "well, at least you don't have covid".</p>
