        <p>People seem to forget that science and truth are not always synonymous. There are many things we understand and know the truth about, but there are also many things we think we understand but haven’t fully figured out yet, and even more we don’t understand at all. Questioning all of it is how we progress. If people accepted “the science” and never questioned the Earth being the center of the universe, how far behind would we be? Science seems to have been weaponized and followed like a religion by a large portion of the population. We’re collectively putting our ego and need to be right above the truth and it’s only setting us back as a species.</p>

        <p>A scientific consensus is reached when a repeatable experiment demonstrates results in line with a hypothesis with a p-value below 0.05. That means science isn’t <em>the truth</em>, but rather the <em>least false explanation</em> for what we observe.</p>

        <p>You are not understanding the basic concepts here.  No scientist would ever tell you that their research findings are "truth".  That is just non-scientific crazy-talk.  Also, hypothesis testing is only one avenue of scientific investigation.  Also, .05 is only one possible p-value that can be assigned.  I would say that scientific consensus is reached when an internally-valid and generalizable study is repeatedly replicated by multiple teams of legitimate researchers, published in multiple respected peer-review journals, and stands up to years of scrutiny and refutation by opposing researchers.  Scientists will never say that a finding is proven.  Scientists will tell you that research has supported or failed to support a finding,</p>

        <p>I think this is disingenuous to how research is actually done. No published, peer-reviewed paper will ever state something is truth, it will state it is statistically significant. A well designed experiment on the other hand will have a single variable such that a significant result can only come from that variable. Like, you're not wrong, but no scientist is arguing you on this and I don't think you're making the point you think you are.</p>
<p>So yeah, the research on vaccines isn't necessarily the truth, but when the results are that they reduce hospitalizations with 99.9% confidence, it's pretty damn far from false. Arguing that maybe this is the 1/1000 chance the result was a false positive is something you can do, but you're probably not gonna be correct.</p>

        <p>This is assuming that the data is real and complete. Some of the pharmaceutical companies have been fined millions of dollars for providing incomplete or dishonest data. We cannot trust their data given that they are exempt from legal repurcusssions for harm done by vaccine.</p>

        <p>There's a boatload of research out there. You just have to take the time to look at it. You can be confident in the scientists' conclusions when different researchers from other institutions agree. So to deny the conclusions of the scientific community on the vaccine you also have to ignore what the academics and government researchers are saying.</p>
<p>I can't think of a single example of anyone being fined for studying the vaccine, you're gonna need to show your sources on that.</p>

        <p>Can you provide a source on that? I haven’t heard about this. As a scientist, I know that when a researcher is proven to have falsified their data it’s a really big deal. Their publications are retracted and it’s pretty much guaranteed they’ll never get funding again. I’m always really interested to hear the details of these stories so I would love to know more about fraud surrounding the COVID vaccines.</p>

        <p>Also note, that while the geocentric theory was created through observations by early astronomers, those same astronomers were heavily involved with theology and also supported theocentric theory (God-centered theory). 
This stands further with the fact that the main government body was between a monarch and a church so they also had the dictation to support their beliefs, even if those same beliefs weren't shared by everyone. 
Science was also categorized under theology as a complete subsection which is far from the truth as a whole, making science on its own less biased from theology (whether its real or not), which heavily impacted "science" back then.

        <p>This is just basic scientific illiteracy.  Empirical science is literally a method of inquiry.  Science is always progressing, always questioning and overturning previous findings, always developing new paradigms and theories.  Scientists never "accept the science", they are constantly questioning accepted concepts and trying to over-turn them.  Science and religion are opposites, in this sense.  It is actually the right-wing religious folks who strongly oppose science.  It was science that determined that the earth isn't the center of the universe and it was religion that desperately resisted that scientific advancement.</p>

        <p>You can have an opinion about what scientists are doing, but pretending that said opinion is relevant to the science itself or in any way improves it when you have no qualifications is delusional. If you don’t want to get a cybernetic eye because you think it’ll kill you when science proves it won’t, that’s fine because it only effects you. The difference in this situation is that vaccines affect more than one person.</p>

        <p>You haven't said anything relevant to my reply.</p>
<p>Science is a process, not a set of correct answers. And a lay person has absolutely every right to challenge an assertion made by scientists especially if other scientists are doing the same.</p>
<p>And where those assertions have social or ethical impacts, to be blunt the scientist has absolutely zero say at all. Their job is to give data, explain it and also explain its shortcomings. Their position on it matters no more than anyone else's as a participating member of society.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like you're attempting to argue for a scientific hegemony because well, if they have the "right" answers just let them make all the decisions right? That isn't how a functioning society works.</p>

        <p>I think you are just missing the point here.  The point is about the importance of actual education, knowledge and experience.  Highly educated and experienced experts are actually better at their jobs than a completely ignorant layman.  We need to base our policies on actual science and the respected experts who know the science best.  When a person needs a heart transplant, they usually go to an actual  surgeon with a real MD and years of experience.   You probably wouldn't want your heart surgery performed by  a construction worker who learned all about heart surgery by attending Trump rallies and watching Tucker Carlson.  Similarly, when NASA needs to build a booster rocket, they always have an actual engineer, who is legitimate expert on rocketry, build the rocket.  NASA never crowdsources the rocket-building team from You-tube.  People forget that expertise and education are important.   This is a result of the Republican war on science and education.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Scientific research is a complex process that requires a great deal of specialized education.  The vast majority of researchers are PhDs.  It takes a great deal of education and experience to be able to conduct or interpret empirical research.   The average person can't understand or interpret scientific research any more than they could perform a heart surgery.  Should the average layman challenge a leading heart surgeon on how to perform a heart transplant?  We obviously can't base our national health strategy on the misinformed (and heavily politically motivated) ideas of  layman with no relevant education and no ability to understand the scientific research.   The only hegemony being suggested is a hegemony of competence.</p>

        <p>You have every right <em>if you know what you’re talking about</em>. A child has no right to question the efficacy of vaccines because they’re completely ignorant of immunology, epidemiology, or any other relevant field, so they can’t ask intelligent questions, certainly not progress the field further. If you have no education in the field, you have no right to question the science itself, because your questions aren’t based on anything other than ignorance. I’m saying if you have no understanding of the topic, you are not able to question science and tricking yourself and others into thinking you can is not just irresponsible, it’s outright dangerous. You can argue about the implementation of scientific discoveries, but even that is often a field of science which you’re uneducated in (in this case, epidemiology. You can’t say whether taking the vaccine is more dangerous than COVID because you’re not educated in this topic).</p>

        <p>That's absurd thinking. The only argument that makes is that experts should be policy makers and the rest of us have to bend over and take it.</p>
<p>The most obvious solution to this is to lock everyone in their house via violent means and let the ones who happen to have enough food to survive, live, and everyone else dies. That ensures there's no interaction that could spread the disease, right? Yet I suspect even you can see how that's not an acceptable solution.</p>
<p>Therefore there IS a point at which the RIGHT answer does not provide a GOOD answer. That is where ADULTS discuss because I get to have an opinion on that solution even if it is perfectly justifiable via "science". I don't need to know shit about the virus to comment on that.</p>

<p>Exactly, you can have an opinion on how to implement the measures in response to what scientists have found, but people thinking they can debate the science when they are uneducated in that expertise are wrong. </p>
<p>Vaccines work, that is something that has reached scientific consensus, it is not our responsibility to debate that, it is the responsibility of scientists in that field. How the government should promote vaccinations however, is up for debate and is something anyone can weigh in on.</p>
<p>arguing policy is good, arguing scientific consensus is bad.</p>

        <p>Scientism is usually used by anti-science people to complain that science is intruding into dynamics traditionally defined and controlled by religion.  For example, the accusation of scientism was made when scientists recommended churches stop sharing the same communion cup with the whole congregation, as it was rapidly spreading covid and herpes.  So scientism is the accusation made by anti-science religious people when science asks questions that religion doesn't want answered.</p>

<p>Huh.  I agree that the dynamic you describe is bad.  But it seems clear that most of commenters here are completely ignoring the scientists and huge body of established scientific research in order to slavishly follow an ignorant politician.  There is no question that all the science and experts strongly supports vaccination and wearing masks.  We can even look at many of our previous highly successful pandemic interventions and be quite sure that vaccinations and masks are the way to go.  Our current strategy against Covid is the result of intensive scientific research and open scientific debate.  It seems that most people here just ignore all the scientific evidence and believe an orange politician who literally claims that Covid is a hoax.  Most of the folks here somehow manage to believe the disgraced former politician when he says that Covid is far less dangerous than the flu, even though almost 600,000 Americans were killed in just a year (this is twice the number of Americans who died during the 5 years of WWII).  Anti-vaxxers are taking a similar position to flat-earthers; they are claiming a conspiracy when their fringe views have just been thoroughly scientifically disproven.</p>

        <p>The thing is, that some experts ARE disagreeing with he general concensus, and instead of rational discussion and research, they get shouted down and banned. I'm not personally against the vaccine or masks.  I am against the government requiring either and the opinions of experts being stifled when it doesn't agree with the narrative.</p>

While the nanny state is created 1984 style and the people responsible will be the expert class and they're Theorytails. Our facts are fueled by the obvious overt GovernMedia propaganda. That anyone who's been paying attention since 911 is aware of what a psyop clearly is. When the government and corporations conduct a simulation (Event 201) then 6 months later Wuhan or the Cyber Polygon in 2020 then wham... Cyber terrorism.

        <p>Because the right has raised up (now multiple) generations of people who are incapable of admitting they are wrong, or that they do not know something. They have been conditioned to hate and distrust academics, so the thought of someone being more intelligent than them because they went to college for 8 years, is (in their mind) insulting.</p>
<p>"These people aren't special, they don't know more about such and such then I do just because they have a graduate degree in such and such."</p>
<p>It's a toxic mindset, and if it continues this way, it'll destroy us.</p>
<p>Imagine if we had people who thought like this prior to eradicating small pox, or polio. We would probably all be dead.</p>

        <p>The science isn't settled for plenty of things, but chances of dying from COVID vs the vaccine is pretty obvious at this point in time. Science has told us that much. We also have pretty good ideas of long-term side effects of both, and again they seem far worse from COVID than the vaccines. Sure, science isn't 100% settled for both, but from what we see one is far better to risk (the vaccine) than the other (COVID).</p>

        <p>Most viruses get out of our systems under a month... Covid has been around for 1.5yrs so far, and we are still learning more about "long COVID" - long term symptoms after youre no longer contagious. To me that is already long term.

        <p>It's at least 1.5 years old, where did you get less than a year? Long term as in people are no longer contagious, but they still present symptoms for months to come, including some that don't seem to be going away at all. All documented side-effects from vaccines occur 1) at far lower frequencies, 2) are not at all long term (as long as we have seen for either covid or vaccine), and 3) are far less severe then covid symptoms</p>

        <p>How many vaccinated children get measles, mumps or rubella, the 3 deadliest childhood diseases around? Science proved those diseases exist and can be cured. Very few people actually understand how a traditional vaccine works, we trust science to protect our children from diseases than can and probably will kill them if they catch it.</p>
<p>Masks were our attempt to slow the spread of a disease we were learning more and more about at the time, the government was wrong at first and forced to backtrack, but they keep trying to keep people safe by preventing new infections. Now that we have vaccines the masks are becoming less and less needed more people can be safe, hospitals have substantially less people and death rates are dropping fast.</p>
<p>Blind trust in authority is wrong, but when people across the political spectrum who disagree on whether blue is a color tell you that masks are important and vaccines are safe,it's pretty safe to trust them.</p>
<p>Do you have any more questions about COVID or misconceptions you'd like clarified?</p>

        <p>Covid killed at least 600,000 American in a year (The number is probably much higher as it is well documented that most states have under-represented their Covid deaths).  More Americans died in 1 year than died in all 5 years of WWII.  Covid is the worst disaster in American history.</p>

<p>"Importantly, the overall effectiveness of immunisation will correlate with rates of vaccine uptake. We therefore encourage researchers, health-care providers, and policy makers to act as advocates for immunisation, and to advise individuals with questions about vaccines to seek this information from reliable sources. The higher the proportion of a population vaccinated, the lower the number of susceptible individuals, and the fewer opportunities SARS-CoV-2 will have to spread and mutate."</p>

        <p>Of course, because less people incubating the disease obviously means it'll mutate faster for some reason.</p>
<p>Not the opposite where less bodies for the disease to live in gives it less chance to change.</p>

        <p>"Science" is "the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment." This doesn't mean some fucktard with a high school diploma should go questioning scientists and doctors when they don't even know what the fuck they are talking about.  This entire sub is full of mouthbreathers. You guys deserve each other.  </p>
<p>Edit: Why don't you antivaccers just cough in each others' faces and fuck each other so you can get too ill to share your stupid fucking opinions again.</p>

<p>Look, no one can define reality. We've only begun to scrape the surface of quantum physics, and that scrape has already been shown to contradict traditional physics in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Even math could be made to appear valid by an artificial tertiary layer of reality which we can't see. We could be in a simulation millions of levels deep, and base reality could be made up of something we can't imagine or quantify.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I love science. But using it as a grounds to usurp individual liberty is evil. </p>
<p>We've already seen genocide happen because of this. </p>
<p>Even if reality is benign and unbiased, the science used to discover it is conducted by flawed humans, and people will twist the findings to justify barbaric things.</p>
<p>Legality doesn't equal morality and neither does science. This is why individual rights <em>must</em> be the formost rule by which we, as a civilization, lead our lifes, regardless of what discoveries are made.</p>

        <p>Nobody is saying don't question things outright. It's fine to question things, but when you collect evidence and it points to a particular conclusion over and over again, you should acknowledge that conclusion is more likely.</p>

        <p>"Die ergriffenen Maßnahmen könnten den Verlauf des Infektionsgeschehens "durchaus positiv beeinflusst haben". Allerdings seien "Lockdown-Light" und "Bundesnotbremse" letztlich "nicht allein ursächlich" für den Rückgang des R-Werts und damit des Infektionsgeschehens."</p>
<p>"So bemängelte der Ökonom Andreas Backhaus auf Twitter, dass "die Möglichkeit von Antizipationseffekten der angekündigten Maßnahmen" von den Forschern außer Acht gelassen worden sei. Der Ausschluss kausaler Zusammenhänge zwischen Maßnahmen und R-Wert sei somit "unvollständig und die entsprechende Textstelle im Bericht falsch"."</p>

        <p>No, you can question anything. It’s just that when questions are asked, they’re immediately and firmly answered. The difference between scenarios like that stemming from good faith or bad faith is the questioners do not accept the answers but continue to ask the same answered questions again and again and again. Then the questioners form a collective victimhood complex spreading misinformation by appealing to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with asking questions. When the questions are answered it’s probably good to stop asking the same questions over and over acting like asking them again and again had any moral grounding.</p>

        <p>Thai is one of the cringiest posts on this sub. Obviously, shit for brains, you can question the science behind vaccines/masks. It’s only when morons like the people in this sub start to put their answers BEFORE their “research”. If you already came to the conclusion that vaccines/masks don’t work without hearing both sides, and no, I don’t mean looking at some dipshit on Twitter screeching about how covid is going to kill everyone on earth, you are an idiot</p>

        <p>Yes, how is this relevant to covid?</p>
<p>People have and do ask questions. Studies have been peer reviewed, check and double checked from various different places. It's the scientific process, you know...that thing that pretty much been correct for hundreds of years and has shaped the relative utopia we live in.</p>
<p>Or do you think all the scientists (like you can even group them together) are all in cahoots and working against you? That's paranoid are delusional. You people want to be the victim so bad. It's pathetic.</p>

        <p>No man. This is deeper than what the scientists are posting. This comes down to the pcr test and what they are truly testing for. There have been many videos of people tricking the pcr test with tomatoes and they come up positive. The pcr tests aren’t looking for Covid.</p>

        <p>A very important step in science is after the questioning, you do the work of finding the answer. This is called the scientific process, you propose a question a.k.a. hypothesis and conduct an experiment to prove or disprove the hypothesis. If all you do is question with no experimentation, that's not science. That's just being argumentative. If you're unwilling to do the work of rigorous scientific experimentation, then don't talk about stuff you don't about. Leave it to the people who have dedicated their lives to that particular field of study.</p>

<p>Ya see, it also matters *who* you ask the questions of.  If you're looking for empirically sourced answers that will actually clarify your misconception, you're not going to get your answers by screaming in the check out line at your local Arby's.  You'd want to identify the sources, offices, people, you could have access to who are making the assertions you're wanting to refute and ask the questions of them.  Start local.</p>

        <p>It was actually a very useful answer, as, while it didn't directly answer your question, it could be applied to help facilitate the answers you're looking for. Your issue is that it isn't what you wanted to hear (OMG, just like my initial comment, re: prOpAGaNDa).</p>
<p>So your questions, it would seem, are rhetorical? You're not really seeking an answer (as you indicate that you already had the data you were looking for available to you), but rather you're attempting to influence opinion.  Got it.  My bad.  I thought you *wanted* to learn where the other side of the convo was coming from, like debating in good faith.  You don't want that.</p>

        <p>First of all I’m not a physician and I dont fully understand everything. I know there is this theory light was faster at the core of the big bang or something. But its acceptable to assume its konstant in vacuum. 
Comparing this now to vaccines or the „propaganda“ is not similar tho, because the point of discussion would not be if vaccines work, but rather how good they are.</p>

        <p>Yes, that very much makes sense. And you nailed it with "Groupthink" it's part of a tactic/manipulation tool that narcissists use all the time. Group think and repeating the old patterns is literally insanity. 
There's many flaws in humanity ... Sadly the majority see them as "flaws" not just seeing them as "differences." This comes from a place of feeling inferior (unworthy of acceptance) because from an early age we are programmed to believe we are not enough. So we put each other down to feel superior.
The irony is our differences (creativity or chaos) is and always will be what moves humanity forward. Chaos is the basis of all creation. IMHO.</p>

Just saying, one of their ""sources"" yesterday was a 5 year old video of a dude talking about how Ebola is a conspiracy theory designed to keep Obama in power forever, they cited that as factual information that the government made up 600,000 deaths to control them or their lives.</p>
<p>Real censorship is the government legally banning dissenting opinion, something that is not happening. Hell, even this sub isn't banned even though nobody cites sources or proves anything, it's just confirmation bias stacked on top of itself to excuse hating science.</p>
<p>Of you really believe COVID is fake, go and prove it, I'll wait for anyone's evidence that COVID is exaggerated, the death counts or fake or any other information, I just need it to be credible and fact checked.</p>
<p>Making extraordinary claims means you must have extraordinary evidence. I've seen extraordinary evidence COVID exists, but none that it doesn't. Prove me wrong if you think I'm wrong, you can't though, but you should still try so I can clear up misconceptions you might have.</p>

        <p>Credible science shows that lockdowns do not work and yet are accepted as gospel; masks have no real world data backing up their effectiveness, yet treated as unquestionable; and that covid is a thoroughly unremarkable virus with our response being ridiculously out of proportion.</p>
<p>Science should re-examine itself if the data does not match the result, yet the result is being treated as an absolute, with all dissenting voices silenced. This is not science.</p>

        <p>I disagree with covid-19 being a "unremarkable virus", it's a highly contagious version of SARS. It also has a higher death rate than the flu or cold while being more infectious. Masks when worn were shown in both lab studies and in real world practice to slow the infection rate over the wider population. I'm also definitely concerned with a virus that killed 1% of our population in a year who'd be alive if it never existed, as should anyone.</p>
<p>Death by covid-19 is absolutely horrible, it's one of the lowest preferred ways to die on my list, suffocating to death makes you feel like your veins are on fire as the CO2 can't escape your blood. I really don't want anyone to die if there are simple measures we can all take to keep the vulnerable safe. I really don't blame you for being skeptical, the government and it's employees lie a lot, it's up to us to look at the information we have and come to our own conclusions about it.</p>

<p>This isn’t a scientific examination of the data, it’s just presented in a way to achieve a certain outcome. </p>
<p>Is there possibly anything similar about states like WY, AR, NE, ND, SD, etc that had low restrictions and low deaths? Could those states maybe be a little different than high restriction/high death rate states like CA, NY, NJ, DC...?

        <p>I have a physics degree! I think it's unusual that you disagree that you're the one who has to make the claim. Science operates by creating models that explain data. If the data disagrees with the model, the model is flawed. Furthermore, those advancing a theory must prove that it works; not vice versa. Otherwise I may as well say that squirrels are the reason for electromagnetism, and if you can't disprove that, then I am absolutely correct.</p>
<p>The data I showed you - as is true of all data - does not back up the theory that masks/lockdowns are effective. Therefore, the theory is incorrect.</p>

        <p>You flat out said “The burden of proof is on the one making a claim”. You are saying that masks and lockdowns don’t work. </p>
<p>What claims have I made? At most my only claim is that your data doesn’t really tell us anything. </p>
<p>Have I said that masks are effective and lockdowns work? Nope. </p>
<p>I can’t even address your last statement as it is so far away from how actual scientific study works it’s laughable. Maybe it’s the physics, you guys like rules that can’t be broken, if the rule can be broken, it can’t exist. 
The vast majority of scientific study isn’t like that. 
You gather the numbers (as you have provided) and then you examine them. The conclusion you’re coming to,  based on that data is very surface level. </p>
<p>Can you think of a reason why certain states had low restrictions and low deaths other than masks and lockdowns don’t work. </p>
<p>Let’s take the lowest state AK. The lowest population density in the U.S. 1.3 people per square mile. Now let’s look at NY at the top not the highest population density but at 417 people per square mile it’s a little different than Alaska. That’s just one glaring difference between the states in that data. Look at all the low states. WY-6, MT- 7, ND- 10.5. Now let’s look at population density in the high states. NJ- 1210, MA-858, DC-10,588 (wowsa). </p>
<p>Now is there anything we know about infectious diseases and population density? </p>
<p>Once again, I’m not making a claim. I’m asking you to back yours up, or look at the data more objectively. </p>
<p>Honestly if you have a degree in physics and this is what you provide to back up your claims, I’m a little embarrassed for you. </p>
<p>So can you provide a peer reviewed study that backs up your claims? One, I will take one study that objectively looks at the data, is peer reviewed, and comes to the conclusion that either masks or lock downs are ineffective. Heck, I’ll even look with you and see if I can find something to back up your claims.</p>

        <p>It is true that you did not personally make the claim that lockdowns and masking are effective. However, that is the "science" that we "hate" and are being faced with, despite being wholly unscientific.</p>
<p>I have no need to go into an exhaustive process of denial because the most elementary and important aspect - the data - does not in any way back up the conclusion that lockdowns and masking work, which are the fundamental attributes and the keystones around covid "science" operates.</p>
<p>It is true that there are outside aspects on the data, but the fact remains that it's impossible to conclude with any of the data presented that lockdowns or masking are effective in the slightest. The default position is that they are not effective; the covid "science" position is that they're not only highly effective but <em>necessary</em> and society itself must be remade to implement their changes indefinitely.</p>
<p>That is an extraordinary claim, made with no evidence. The fact that the very most simplistic approach shows that to be the case means that no further work is necessary. This isn't even a question of "they work, but by how much of a %? Is it worth the collateral damage?" - but a simple refutation of the entire principle.</p>
<p>If I present a theory that the number of ants in a given region affects how many people get cancer, and then all available data shows no apparent correlation, you're not required to conduct a massive study to disprove me. I have failed the very most fundamental aspect.</p>

        <p>Golly, you could’ve just said “No, I can’t back up my claim”. </p>
<p>In the simplest terms, you have a hypothesis. There is no “default position”. There is a question, one anyone should ask, are these measure effective? You have a very definitive answer, so prove it. Do you have data, all other things being equal, that shows these measures aren’t effective. Comparing wildly different populations doesn’t cut it. 
Even the data provided, a 7 day average, shows that the highest deaths per state in that period were IA and WV, states shown to have less restrictions. Making this claim, using that data is filled with holes. It’s a tiny fraction of the numbers, and the numbers are very recent.</p>

        <p>Okay so here are the most conclusive evidence review studies on mask efficacy. </p>
<p>The first link supports your claim, it took a long time to find anyone stating your claim with studies to back it up. It’s barely an evidence review. It’s listed as an opinion piece. </p>
<p>The second link refutes it. I was able to find multiple studies, and evidence reviews concluding that masks do help prevent spread. I chose this one as it contained the most source material. </p>
<p>On the surface both of these evidence reviews come to fairly conclusive decisions. 1 for 1 against. </p>
<p>Initially the problems that the against study is, that it’s only one reviewer, It’s only 7 articles and the reviewer makes multiple statements that there are no studies, of any kind, that conclude masks help. Essentially he says here are 7 studies that prove my point and absolutely none exist that refute it. A quick google search and you can find he has rather biased views that may prevent him from an honest inquiry. He’s also physics professor, not in any field related to biology. </p>
<p>The 2nd review doesn’t suffer these same issues. 21 reviewers with varied background, ranging from epidemiology to statistics. They’re credentials are listed ( as it should be for this type of study). They review 85 studies. The studies are much more recent (as we have massive amounts of recent data for some reason). Also I googled a few of the authors and couldn’t find anything like I did with the first links authors. Theses authors  may be biased, I don’t know. It’s a quick search to figure out Rancourt has an agenda.  Really google him and ask if he’s truly unbiased?</p>
<p>Are both of these truly objective? Can you find a source similar to either of mine that can back your claim? I would honestly love to read a valid source. </p>

        <p>Masks work when everyone wears them. Even if just a SINGLE person who has COVID does not wear a mask they can infect dozens of people a day it only takes one of those people not wearing their mask to infect even more. That's not even including those people's family members. </p>
<p>As for the lockdowns, the reason the states with heavier restrictions have higher death rates is because generally they are more densely populated, so not only are there more people to infect, but they're closer to each other in general.</p>

<p>Dude, that article is about the government censoring medical workers who want to talk about how BAD the situation was in terms of over-work, PPE shortages etc. The exact opposite of what you're saying. That article even links to medical workers being threatened with firings in the US for speaking out against the government message of "we're prepared"</p>

        <p>Did you even bother to read the article?  There is not a single suggestion that staff are wanting to speak out about COVID being a hoax or so called vaccine injuries - they are talking about lack of equipment, understaffing and under resourcing. Your link title is completely misleading. </p>

        <p>I wish that was the case more often than not.  Anecdotally, my reddit experience has been that questioning any of the mainstream Left ideologies in any educated way results in downvote silencing.  The political silencing has been pervasive through some of my favorite subreddits that aren't even political.  The result of this has made Reddit less enjoyable overall.</p>

        <p>I don't know why you keep downvoted because it's a fair talking point you've made.</p>
<p>The most relevant leftist ideology you are not allowed to criticize is critical theory or critical race theory or to challenge the implications of the "patriarchy."  These ideas, like most leftist ideologies, are masked as "compassion" and "equity" when their outcomes are quite the opposite.  Disagreeing with these ideologies makes you a bad person and therefore justifies the silencing.  When we allow that, it allows for the collectivist voice to prevail and discourages dialogue.</p>

        <p>There are five major components or tenets of CRT: (1) the notion that racism is ordinary and not aberrational; (2) the idea of an interest convergence; (3) the social construction of race; (4) the idea of storytelling and counter-storytelling; and (5) the notion that whites have actually been recipients of civil rights legislation.   </p>
<p>You can find more about it here --&rt; https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED506735.pdf</p>
<p>Here's my analysis of critical theory/critical race theory:<br>
Critical theory places little-to-no value on meritocracy and individualism in favor of collectivism. It creates an oppressed versus oppressor narrative using dimensions of one’s character that are not only unchangeable but nearly impossible to fully calculate. The similar oppression narrative located in section 1 of the Communist Manifesto are the foundations for this movement. Thus, it is social-Marxism.  BLM, which pushes CRT as the solution to our racial divide, advocates for social Marxism at their highest ranks within their movement. The LGBT movement and feminisms movements are also completely possessed by this oppressed/oppressor ideology as well.<br>
Oppression is broken down into these group dynamics and has little-to-no room for individualism. Race and sex would be examples of just some of the dimensions used to determine whether one is an oppressor or oppressed. What ends up happening is one attempts to calculate the advantages v. disadvantages they have through these dimensions in an attempt to compare themselves to their proverbial neighbor instead of comparing yourself to yourself. We focus on our differences instead of similarities outside of our group dynamics and it divides us on a larger scale. The attempts of critical theorists to solve some of our country’s most serious problems is contributing to the polarizing of our political spectrum, actually increasing racial tensions, increasing violence, and limiting our discussion platforms so that the ones who identify as the most oppressed are favored to speak. Identity is taking precedent over competency because critical theory promotes hierarchies being the primary foundations of power instead of competency.<br>
These groups that one, let’s say, “belong to” are now used to justify their oppression, and therefore, grants them more of a right to speak. More insidiously, critical theory promotes invalidating “oppressors.” Oppressed groups are not just fighting the racial and social divides, but rather, they are fighting against each other’s “oppressed” groups because they consider their dimensions of character more oppressed. It is promoting tribalism, and in strengthening this collectivism, it is limiting our ability to fight the peer pressure of groupthink.</p>

<p>You can question science. You can question the science of the vaccine. But if the question has been asked before, and the answer is known and has been repeatedly provided, don’t be surprised if people get annoyed that you <em>keep asking the same question when the answer is already available.</em> </p>
<p>If you can point out very specific and pertinent flaws in the over decade of research that led up to the development of the vaccine by all means do share them, but I doubt you’ll be able to unless you actually have a PhD in the appropriate fields. A structural engineer probably isn’t going to take tips from a baker on how to build something unless it’s <em>very</em> basic and <em>very</em> obvious. If it’s THAT basic and obvious, the issue has most likely long been addressed.</p>

<p>1 American. The rest died of medical complications either on the 6th or on the 7th.</p>
<p>The only person to actually be <strong>killed</strong> was an unarmed woman and she was killed by a government agent (a leftist at that. Who had posted that they wanted to kill Trump supporters on their social media). But that's (D)ifferent to you idiots because she was white and didn't agree with your politics.</p>

        <p>Lol. “If trump said anything like that”. He has a multitude of rape allegations. Anyway, I didn’t elect him. The country did. Poor guy he should be tending to his flower garden not running the free world. We should have an age cap on the presidency. Did my question strike a nerve?</p>

        <p>Wdym you can’t question it? No one is stopping you from asking why we should wear masks or why the vaccine is vital towards global health. If you want to ask, go ahead! You’ll probably be able to find a ton of people who would be enthusiastic to explain why we should do these things, especially if it means helping out. However, if you decide to forego asking due to your own ignorance or negligence, and blindly draft opinions for no reason, then don’t be surprised when people think you’re an idiot for claiming there’s “propaganda” that’s forcing people to take the vaccine or wear masks. And you guys wonder why we’re mocked on a lot of popular subreddits. Inb4 banned for controversial opinion.</p>

        <p>Because that theory is so incredibly outlandish that it's foolish to jump to it first. Virologists expected to find an animal link that is a close enough match to the human variant that it would explain where it came from. Since we haven't managed that yet, they're circling back around to the possibility it originated in the lab, although the idea that it was specifically engineered for this purpose still lacks any credibility whatsoever.</p>

        <p>Because you claiming the earth being flat whilst wrong won't cause anyone to take risky behavior causing their own or another persons death. </p>
<p>You claiming it's a lab leak with zero evidence when there were other more likely causes to examine first will cause others to take risky/violent behaviors as people have someone to wrongly blame and punish. (i.e. the chinese)  It's the effect of damaging the innocent which caused the private business to censor you.  If you're unhappy with it, quit Facebook. It's pretty easy.</p>
<p>If you're angry it wasn't presented on the news a year ago, you're an idiot.  There wasn't enough evidence then, but now it seems to be mounting so now it's being discussed by credible sources.  Just because you were right on your gut instinct without any evidence doesn't mean you should be free to throw accusations around via your gut.  </p>
<p>If you want anyone to be able to post accusations based on their gut and have the news take it seriously then my gut says you're a pedophile and everyone needs to report on that even though I have zero evidence.</p>
<p>Now that it's a more likely scenario it's being looked into, but before you were just spreading conspiracy with no evidence and potentially dangerous effects.</p>

        <p>No one would tell you to not question science, but spreading misinformation is damaging to society. What we know so far is that risks of COVID far exceed risks of the vaccines, and that wearing masks seems to help (two reviews on mask wearing here: https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776536)</p>
<p>Question science all you want, but listen to the answers that people give rather than coming up with conspiracy theories to "prove" your points.</p>

        <p>Yes it can be proven. Why is science not provable? If you calculate something that will happen in an experiment and that thing exactly happens, it's a prove. At least that's what happens in 99,99% of the cases because there is a little chance that something random or unexpected happens.</p>

I’m sure if you ask your government food proof they’ll give you where to look. If you can find it in yourself to be respectful of the millions that died in ww2 that is.

        <p>Except you get people with no knowledge of virology or any knowledge of how viruses work, and people who’s “research” is only what other people say. Reading sky actual peer reviewed study shows getting vaccinated is essential to getting rid of the virus before it mutates and everyone starts to get sick again with a potential much higher lethality rate. That’s what the Spanish flu did. People that are “skeptics” that refuse to wear masks and won’t get vaccinated need to be forced to be helped, just like making people wear seat belts, or parents making their kids eat other foods besides pasta.</p>

        <p>Government doing stuff is not fascism. In that case any country that requires seatbelts, drivers licenses, sex offender registries, minimum wage, or child labor laws are all authoritarian dictatorships. Sometimes the government has to help people from themselves like making kids go to school or my other examples. You clearly don’t know what evil is either.</p>

        <p>Well how many people have ended up in jail for questioning the vaccine? And the Holocaust?</p>
<p>Outside some countries in Europe questioning the Holocaust is perfectly legal, very widely frowned upon but legal. It's frowned upon to question legitimacy of elections or vaccines too, but it's not a crime in and of itself.</p>
<p>Stay safe, get vaccinated if your doctor says it's safe, enjoy the sunshine stranger.</p>

<p>He has no logical point to respond to. I don't understand what you're getting at. If the OP would like to make a logical argument, I'd be happy to respond in kind.</p>
<p>Problem is I haven't found a single logical argument for lockdowns (that doesn't use one of these https://www.logicalfallacies.org/)  over individual's rights of self governance and risk appetites and mitigation strategies.</p>

        <p>Alright, so the basic idea is that every time you interact with an infected person, you have a chance to contact covid from them. Either from touching things they've touched, or from small airborne particles. Every person that gets infected can then go on to infect others. This cycle would slow down if everyone tried to have less social interactions. And since the chance of serious consequences from covid is non-zero, socially distancing saves lives.</p>

        <p>I appreciate you taking a stab at it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I believe that your argument is taking the approach and assumption that the only way to combat the virus is avoidance. This was the approach initially taken by W.H.O and subsequently CDC. Then the rest of the world followed suit. They really pushed the novel aspect as hard as possible (even though now we're seeing more and more evidence that it was in fact leaked from a Lab in Wuhan, like we suggested 1.5 years ago) - and that guided the misguided approach that we had to through out everything we know about immunology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe that your argument is solely for 'social distancing' - which on the surface is a fine argument, as it appears logical. My main argument is not against social distancing (although, I do hate it personally)  but government forced lockdowns. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every scenario in the public (I would have been okay with designation of public needs such as grocery stores/hospitals/post office etc maybe having some health and safety requirements there) is optional. You have the right to self governance. You have the right to measure your own risk, your risk appetite, and your mitigation strategies for such risk. For me, I am incredibly low risk, and in the off chance I did get it, I do not interact with elders at all. Only possible scenario is in my concession of public needs such as a grocery store. In that scenario, I would be OK with social distancing to protect the elders.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Don't wanna catch the rona in a restaurant? Great, don't go. Willing to take the risk? Great, go. Don't want to catch the rona in a movie theater? Stay home. Don't force the movie theater to close.</p>

        <p>Okay fair, the example of grocery store is a pretty good one, but I don't think it's the only one. Think of stuff like public transportation and hospitals, both often non-optional. Now imaging sharing those spaces with people that don't care that they have covid because they are low risk versus sharing it with people that are constantly doing their best to avoid it. One situation would contain more infected people than the other, and thus one would be more dangerous. This is why many people think covid risk is more than a personal choice. Sure, I'll barely notice if I catch it. But what if I end up infecting someone else, perhaps a more vulnerable person? That person would've been fine if not for me. That's why I do that I can to prevent infecting myself, mainly for others.</p>
<p>I haven't heard anyone talk about your first point though, what do you mean by that? What alternatives are there? Chould be worth considering at least.</p>

<p>This part of the argument is thoroughly been repeated. My rebut is this: If those people measured their risk for optional activities (such as going to a restaurant, movies, concert, football game, any major gathering, church) and decided it was worth it, it is on them. Not you. You do not have the burden of everybody else's health on your conscience. Unless of course you get to control their diet and exercise as well, otherwise it is entirely unfair for you to take on that burden.</p>
<p>About 3 weeks in it became abundantly clear who was at risk: Old people, and fat people. Especially old fat people. We could have very easily pivoted to protecting the at risk (ie. like grocery stores opening only for elders first 2 hours of the day) and allowing everyone else to go on about their lives. We would have hit herd immunity so much longer ago. And yes, we do produce antibodies that last a very long time. Some studies suggest lifetime of antibodies. Again, the 'appeal to novelty' - a logical fallacy has been driving the narrative that led us to abandon what we know of immunology and bone marrow and T-Cells.</p>

        <p>What do you mean abandon what we know about immunology? As I understand it the immunity doesn't last that long, as there have been people that got covid twice. Usually it changes per virus. You could argue that we aren't sure about the covid immunity length, but even so I'd rather not risk it.</p>
<p>I'd agree with the grocery timeslots plan, though that would be more difficult in public transport and even more difficult in hospitals (to continue with my examples)</p>

        <p>I don't think the majority of this sub would have any problem with a mask mandate/mandatory social distancing in a hospital. That makes sense. Closing down someone's hardware store because they 'can't social distance' but keeping lowes open is stupid. </p>
<p>As far as the immunity goes; unlike every other respiratory virus we have treated this virus as if immunity doesn't work the same way it has with every other virus (noro corona or others) which your body produces antibodies for and your T-cell receptors recognize the virus and build an immune response.</p>
<p>Most of the cases where someone got it twice was a faulty PCR test. There are some rare examples of people getting reinfected with the disease not merely having antibodies present as a sign of having the virus.</p>
