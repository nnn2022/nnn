    <strong>So what needs to happen to stop this?</strong>
    <p><p>What is it that we, the people, have to do to put a stop to all of this insane bullshit? </p>
<p>Say we, as a collective here in the subreddit, decided to organize and do something to bring things back to normal, legally the way things were before the pandemic. What actions could we take to succeed? </p>
<p>I would say protest, and that's a good start, but that doesn't seem like enough. Can we raise money and help organize businesses to open in defiance of governors' orders? Help pay the fines of businesses who refuse to enforce mask orders? Can we organize and find lawyers to sue these leaders and force them to stop? What about recalling corrupt governors and mayors, would we have a shot of making that happen before the election?</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas?</p></p>

        <p>Some sort of civil guerrilla warfare needs to happen...trying tactics within the framework of the existing system, like recalls and sueing won't work because the system is corrupt.  </p>
<p>We've tried sueing here in my state and a judge actually ordered the lockdowns illegal but the governor just makes a plea to the state supreme court because "public health emergency!!" and gets an indefinite hold on the ruling. </p>
<p>The main problem is our fellow citizens.  They will fight NOT to re-open because of their extreme fear.  </p>
<p>I've always liked the idea of a big "mask off" group going into a large grocery store and walking up and down the aisles.  That could get ugly though if someone calls the cops or some masktard shopper gets physical.</p>

<p>It won't, these people are cowards when they don't have the numbers. They have propaganda on their side, that's it.</p>
<p>I want mass grocery store raids, people are broke and getting hungry. Mass shoplifting is more peaceful than what is coming. It won't take long for things to even out, states/communities printing their own currencies (already happening for awhile now). </p>
<p>We have to wake up the masses, everyone needs to do their part and scream the truth from the mountaintops. Consequences be damned. This is a manufactured crisis so we need a more-organized response to defeat it.</p>

        <p>Society has bought into this too much. We had news on at work this morning and they had a segment that people aren’t complying with masks/social distancing and that the number of deaths could double before the end of the year. They showed manipulated photos of beaches and boardwalks looking packed. One of my coworkers said aloud “I can’t believe people are going to the beach, they should all get Covid and die.” and the other said “yeah I can’t believe people have the nerve to go on vacation, it’s like these people are begging to get Covid. This is never going to end until everyone does their part. They should all get Covid to learn a lesson.”</p>
<p>They already know my feelings about this, but no matter how much data I throw at them, they don’t listen or care. The TV can literal tell them anything
and they believe it. It’s like they worship MSM, it’s their god.</p>
<p>As long as MSM has people who are unable to think critically and eat this stuff up, this won’t end. Not in November, not in summer 2021, and ever. It’s extremely hard to change people’s way of thinking when it’s fear based. For this to end MSM and social media both need to not exist anymore.</p>

        <p>mass awareness and mass non compliance.</p>
<p>it is the sheep, that are dragging us down!</p>
<p>whatever means to achieve mass awareness helps, be it fliers,  social media posts, talking to friends family, protests, lawsuits, whatever u think is best, DO IT!</p>
<p>remember, that the goal is not to petition the pedophile criminal mass murdering governments or try to ask the criminal and pedophile courts for justice, but to get people to step away from the slavery.</p>
<p>this whole system only works on the back of programmed  blind sheep, as hard as it is, we NEED to wake them up! and just step away through non compliance.</p>
<p>the criminals on top can't close every shop, they can't throw us all into prisons, hell they can't even remove a million people peacefully protesting in berlin.</p>
<p>they are powerless against an awakened public, so we NEED to get there.</p>

        <p>in regards to  browser choice (responding to something else than this comment here, but doing it here for others to see):</p>
<p>while this website hasn't been updated for a bit, it has still great information on how certain browsers are garbage and also shows mitigation guides for browsers:</p>
<p><a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/browsers.html">https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/browsers.html</a> </p>
<p>it for example will show, that brave is a garbage dumpster fire, which some people might think the opposite, because of brave's lying marketing and brave's affiliate setup.</p>
<p>but i actually don't know what a good browser, that is NOT based on chromium is. of course using firefox with the full and long mitigation guide is better than using it as default spying shit, but i wouldn't use it.</p>
<p>i would just use or suggest iridium, chromium or torbrowser to get over geolocks.  torbrowser is firefox based, as u probs know, but the location  and stuff can't be spied on and auto updates are also not an issue as they go through the tornetwork, of course the tor network can be questioned on many levels.</p>
<p>but yeah sorry no idea what a great non chromium based browser would be, but look at the website, maybe u'll find one :)</p>

        <p>All of these things. I think we need to start an open your business fund. Although, I'm not 100% GoFundMe wouldn't just remove it, are there other options for this that would still allow us to get to word out? </p>
<p>I would say also we should be donating to the Children's Health Defense. </p>
<p>The other thing besides strict non-compliance is malicious compliance. Wear a totally gory, ridiculous Halloween mask when you go shopping. Surely, this will upset some Doomers (as they are Puritans at heart) and maybe when they complain to staff and the staff says, "yeah, but they are wearing a mask", it may shake their faith. </p>
<p>The other thing is wearing the mask wrong on purpose like someone else said.</p>

        <p>Well if they try to make me wear a mask first of all I'm gonna contest that int he courts in my country. Our constitution very specifically says the government cannot simply make masks compulsory with passing a whole new law that has to pass through Cabinet. Which they have not done. </p>
<p>The city I live close to has decided to ignore the constitution and is mandating masks in shopping streets starting on Wednesday. Tomorrow I will be going into town, no mask of course, and then I'll wait and see what happens after that. If I have to go back into the city before this ridiculous mask-mandate  is dismantled by the professors of constitutional law here and I do get fined for not wearing a mask I will contest it. And the law professors say we would have a good chance to win that. </p>
<p>Basically i dont plan on bowing down.</p>

        <p>This is exactly the question we need to be asking. We can't just mock other people and expect them to come around eventually, not only is that a masktard tactic but it makes people less likely to want to listen to your opinions.</p>
<p>We need to do SOMETHING. If we just stay home and stay quiet nothing is going to change. People say most people aren't cool with lockdowns, but everyone sure seems to be where I live. Have seen maybe 10 people not wearing a mask in the last month and it's disgusting and dehumanizing.</p>

        <p>I've been thinking about this a lot. We need to create what we want instead of waiting for TPTB to do that for us (they won't). We need to figure out what kind of a world we want and work towards it. For me, I want good healthy clean food, water, and environment, a logical approach to problem solving, and medical freedom for simple bullet point starters... I also want to live in a culture of personal responsibility. I'm so tired of people blaming other people, policing other people, and shaming other people. ALSO we need to support organizations that do fight for freedoms for the people. Legal precedent against tyranny. A breakaway culture is probably our only hope. Separate and let the rest of society go it's own way. Use modern technology and medicine for what it is best at and not support those systems beyond that. There's a lot of good in this world. Human existence is temporary, a blip. Let's use our time to do good. Let's be positive. Some good will come of all this.</p>

        <p>I’ll preface this by saying I’m not entirely against masks. I wear one when I have to. </p>
<p>But what do you think “a few months” of that would accomplish? It’s certainly clear that that wouldn’t eradicate the virus even if we had near 100% usage. I live in LA and the mask usage is extremely high and we’ve had a mandate for months. Look at the trajectory of cases here as just one example of many and it clearly hasn’t accomplished much. Perhaps some sure, who am I to say, but combine it with intense lockdowns and that still hasn’t been enough to curb it let alone eradicate it. It simply spreads too easily and there is little to no evidence that cloth masks, bandanas, and other non-medical grade masks can curb the spread of a virus to any significant degree. </p>
<p>If you’re referencing the idea that a vaccine will be ready in that timeframe that alone is a lofty dream, but even if it was, mass production would be expected to take until at least mid 2021 and likely much longer.</p>
<p>So with that, knowing that this won’t completely disappear regardless of what actions are taken, I’m genuinely curious why you’re citing that timeframe and what your expectations would be.</p>

        <p>This kind of attitude irks me. It's divisive, immoral, and only hampers us. It's why a lot of the mask subreddits have been brigaded. People have infiltrated anti-lockdown and anti-mask subreddits and used respectability politics, like yours here, to disguise what are really efforts to prevent us from gaining confidence, organizing, and moving forward to stop them.</p>

        <p>So they can shift the goalposts again? I thought it was just 2 weeks. The curve is flat. We will never irradiated the virus. Let's learn to live with it. Masks have not been proven effective. There is a great debate on digital debates with Dennis rancourt. I'd you put his name and the word debate into YouTube you will find it. Listen to both sides then read the literature posted to back up the claims. We need open dialogue. Can I ask what makes you think masks are effective?</p>

        <p>Lol 'data' in quotations. Come on I'm not trying to get into another Internet debate. I'm just surprised you have drawn your conclusion after actually looking at the data. What are your thoughts on jacobs, J. L. et al. 2009? Crowling, B et al. 2010? I mean we have yet to get a randomized control study with verified outcome that shows a benefit for community  members in households wearing masks or n95. So it's fairly easy to say the data is just not there cause there is no study
I could go on but I'm not interested in a rubuttal. But if you are actually interested in looking over a bunch of studies I will copy and paste a wall of text for you.</p>

        <p>But lots of studies show the exact opposite. The science is far from settled. Like I said I'm not interested in a debate about masks. But I think we can both agree that there are 2 sides, one is more popular and gets more air time. The other is just as rooted in science  as the pro mask side is. Earlier you thought I was going to provide YouTube links and Facebook posts. When I cited studies you just ignored them. I have lots of other studies but I doubt you will look at them anyway. I guess it comes down to what studies you think provide your confirmation bias for your fear</p>

<p>Here are key anchor points to the extensive scientific literature that establishes that wearing surgical masks and respirators (e.g., "N95") does not reduce the risk of contracting a verified illness:</p>
<p>• Jacobs, J.. L. et al. (2009) "Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold among health care workers in Japan: A randomized controlled trial," American Journal of Infection Control, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 - 419.
N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.
• Cowling, B. et al. (20110) "Face masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: A systematic review," Epidemiology and Infection, 138(4), 449-456. DOI:10.1017/S0950268809991658
None of the studies reviewed showed the benefit of wearing a mask in either HCW or community members in households (H). See summary Tables 1 and 2 therein.
â€¢ bin-Reza et al. (2012), "The use of masks and respirators to prevent transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence," Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(4), 257-267.
"There were 17 eligible studies. [...] None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against inï¬‚uenza infection."
• Smith, J.D. et al. (2016) "Efffectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting health care workers from acute respiratory infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis", CMAJ Mar 2016, cmaj.150835; DOI: 10.1503/cmaj.150835
"We identified 6 clinical studies ... In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in the associated risk of (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, or (c) reported work-place absenteeism."

<p>So I'm not going to go through every link and debunk all of them. I randomly selected 3 links, and none of them support the argument that masks aren't effective at slowing the covid pandemic, and one of them in fact support MY argument.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27531371/ - this study literally shows that masks have some efficacy at filtering particulates. And it was about what gets in, also. When much of the facemask argument is about limiting exposure from those with the virus. Also it wasn't included multiple times in the list. Nice work bud. Shouldn't be on a list of antimask articles.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25858901/ - this study straight up says that facemasks help prevent the spread of infections lmfao. Shouldn't be on this list.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25806411/ - this is a study about using UV radiation to sanitize used n95s. Does absolutely nothing to support an argument against masks. Shouldn't be on an antimask list.</p>
<p>You clearly just got this half-baked list off some Facebook or Reddit post, and I sincerely doubt you have any formal training whatsoever in scientific literacy. Disappointing, but not surprising.</p>
<p>This was a pathetic display of your "research skills." If this was a school assignment, you'd literally fail. I hope you stop and think and actually reconsider your beliefs now, but I won't be surprised if you just double down on your emotionally held beliefs...</p>

        <p>As I said I'm not interested in debate I can already tell the type of person you are. You asked for studies I gave them to you and now you make assumptions who I am and say all the science I gave you is not good enough. Your first link is from wiki. I'm the one that's disappointed. Have a good night maybe brush up on your research skills and actually look at the studies and not the interpretations of.</p>

<p>“A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”</p>

<p>You're the one who linked a pile of studies that don't say anything at all close to what you claim, which I calmly and clearly explained. But of course you don't care about that, only the things that confirm your bias. Fucking laughable!</p>
