        <p>I got cancer when I was 14. I had to face my mortality at an incredibly young age. This response to Covid has told me that the vast majority of people are absolutely terrified of death. They cannot fathom that something out of the blue could kill them at any given moment.</p>

        <p>Right? They need something to blame that makes them feel some semblance of control, some way to make sense of the randomly deleterious virus. So they blame OTHERS who are living their normal lives. They call them “selfish” and “murderers” to get them to comply. </p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your cancer. Glad you’re still around! And it sounds like you came to live your life fearlessly despite the illness. Good on you!</p>

        <p>Lol we both just got downvoted. You are exactly right how people just blame each other. Its a dangerous game. "My life isn't normal because you won't let my life be normal". The rhetoric is so weird. It causes so much division</p>

        <p>My father died of cancer when I was 13 and I remember kissing his cold forehead while he was in the casket just before the funeral. Looking back, it was an important part of growing up for me. All of us had our death warrants signed on the same day as our birth certificates, and the sentence will eventually be carried out. </p>
<p>Luckily, it's extremely unlikely to be covid that does the job.</p>

        <p>It's a little hard to sell the argument that a nation where most of the leading causes of death are preventable is somehow uniquely afraid of dying. If we're so afraid of death, why do we tolerate such high rates of infant mortality, automobile accident, suicide, gun violence, overpriced healthcare, lifestyle illnesses like primary heart disease (#1 killer), alcoholism and other addictions, low food safety standards...certainly some of these things are worse elsewhere but Americans are pretty good at dying totally avoidable deaths so if we were motivated by death-avoidance, why wouldn't we be avoiding death in any of these other ways?</p>

        <p>Why?  Because most of those things happen to <em>other</em> people -- poor white trash that us college-educated elites wouldn't be caught dead hanging around with. </p>
<p>No, <em>we</em> go vegan, <em>we</em> own fancy exercise gear, <em>we</em> lobby against guns, so we're insulated against the bad stuff.  Then something like Covid comes along, and all of a sudden we see that death really is going to happen to us too, and we lose our little minds.</p>

        <p>THIS. For all the propaganda bullshit on how we're "all in this together", the true mindset of those who fear covid is "I got mine, screw you." Whether "mine" is a happy family at home, a cushy work from home job, or a private tutor to supplement the abysmal joke that is online learning.</p>
<p>If our society took "deaths of despair" seriously as a social problem, instead of paying cheap lip service to #mentalhealthawareness, we'd have never locked down.</p>

        <p>I'm an atheist. That being said, as I've gotten older I have seen the benefits (to society) of religion. I think this severe fear of death in the west is partly an unintended consequence of rise of atheism in the west. There is no "Kingdom of Heaven" for these people to look forward to - only the cold ground. People use to gladly throw their lives away (and still do in the Middle East), because they expected eternal after life. Now they don't even want to leave their house for fear of the boogy-flu.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I get that. This is missing the context of the discussion which was basically that first world nations are so privileged economically that we don’t accurately measure the risks vs benefits of lockdowns like countries that don’t have the illusion of “eternal youth” so prevalent in western culture.</p>

        <p>This is one explanation. Some people are scared of death, and especially scared by feeling like they have no control over it. But most people do activities that risk death fairly often, driving being one of them.</p>
<p>People choose to commute on major highways, even though they drive past car crashes monthly, if not weekly. People think they can mitigate the risk by driving carefully, and they can, to a degree. There's always a chance an accident you can't avoid or foresee will take your life.</p>
<p>What people don't realize is you can mitigate risks of viruses too. Eating healthy, being healthy etc. And viruses can also cause chronic debilitating illness or death. There's always a chance, even with a minor cold, of getting CFS, mechanism still not clear. </p>
<p>People can understand the concepts, but perhaps the numbers and stats are "scary" especially to math-illiterate people.</p>

<p>This is the key. Because they can't understand the insignificance of the numbers they are alarmed by the tone of the voice the fucking stupid journalists use. This is the key, they don't know math. </p>
<p>And unfortunately, they don't want to know math... Democracy is overrated.</p>

        <p>This is a perfect summation of my thoughts on the matter as well. Nations with actual problems and actual deadly pathogens (eg. most places in africa) don't have the resources and patience to pretend this is a world altering plague. But the modern West is a different story.</p>

        <p>Well said. I think another thing that has contributed to the fear is all the vaccines. We have a vaccine for basically every virus/disease. Even for chicken pox! I don’t know the number but seriously how many kids die from chicken pox? Our society here in the US is so clean we forget we have a pretty amazing immune system. We have hand sanitizer, Clorox wipes, bleach, medicine for every little thing, vaccines galore.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, I've been saying this same thing for awhile. As what the media calls us ...  antivaxxers ... The truth is that often we are parents that have had to face mortality years ago. Some of us held our children while we thought they were dying in our arms. Some of us watched our children die. Most of us are told we are killing our children by not vaccinating. We have dealt with the fear of mortality and we have learned to sit with it and not fear it's presence. There is sadness surrounding death. It's awful. But there is no life without death. The idea of eliminating death is scarier than anything to me.</p>
