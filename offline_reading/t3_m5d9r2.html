        <p>&rt; <strong>My uncle may die</strong> without seeing most of his family again because of one ignorant family member. She thought since she was vaccinated the mask no longer applied to her. Now her entire house is infected and they have recently been to my uncles. 
<strong>He has terminal cancer and is now in in-home hospice.</strong> My entire side of the family has had to hold off on a visit until 2 weeks after the negative tests to be sure we are safe to go there. (He just wants to see his family before he dies which those of us who can are willing to take the risk and make the 8+ hour drive)
So please keep wearing your masks. You don't know whose life you may be impacting, or even ending. </p>
<p>&rt; TLDR: We made it a year and when it counted someone slipped up and potentially destroyed all chances for my uncles dying wishes to be granted by not wearing a mask after being vaccinated.</p>
<p>&rt; -I have been on here for years but in my grief of knowing my uncles time is up I deleted most of my social media accounts to start fresh. I needed to feel in control of something in my life. I don't care about the points <strong>I just want people to remember until we reach herd immunity and the CDC/Fauci says so, we need to keep wearing our masks for others.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Edit: 
&rt;Please if you have any family history of cancer get tested early, talk to your doctor about proactive measures. 
If you have a prostate get it checked, I know it's a weird thing for guys but as one of my loved ones who survived it said "Dying of ass cancer is probably the most embarrassing way to go" 
Prostate cancer has been one of the cancers that has impacted the men in my life the most over the past 5 years so it's a cause that's near and dear to my heart. </p>
<p>&rt;For everyone,
&rt;Do self exams, listen to your body, talk to your doctor when something feels wrong. 
My uncle only got tested when his arthritis flared up and at that point it was too late and was in his bones. Cancer can sneak up on you, but we can do our best to mitigate it's impact by catching it early.</p>
