    <strong>Fully vs. Partial</strong>
    <p><p>At first I was confused why the Moderna/Pfizer was in two shots. But, I explained it away as “they must want to simply get <em>more</em> of what’s in there, in there.”</p>
<p>I often Reddit-search “anti vaxxer” to see what the sleepers are consuming, and have recently noticed an up-tic in intra-group hostility….The TwoShotters and PartialShotters have beef. </p>
<p>Multiple shots as a psychological tool— These parasites are excellent practitioners of “divide and conquer”; you have to give them that.</p></p>

<p>You know it's funny you should say that, OP. There was an uptick in memes about people waiting for just that to happen a few days ago. I'm not sure if I love or hate when life imitates memes.</p>
