    <strong>I'm done trying</strong>
    <p><p>I just told my teacher(mentor) that i'm done with college until we get back to the classroom and that's never so i told her goodbye. She had a small breakdown and was like 'what do you mean never'? 'We're going to have mass vaccinations and we will be able to go class again this spring/summer!' And i just laughed and told her she's extremely naive.</p>
<p>Same goes to a business partner. I told him to close down his business already because he's just losing money until his inevitable downfall. Same reaction' but tourism will go back up in the spring/summer, i'll be fine until then!' </p>
<p>I'm done trying to resist anything or convince people.</p>
<p>The virus is very real but is it as dangerous as the media and government makes it out to be? No. </p>
<p>But for what reason are they shutting down everything? 
How does that benefit them or anyone? </p>
<p>They want more power? How does that benefit them? A broken society that's just is violent towards the government?</p>
<p>Then there's that 'bill gates' theory that he wants to sell the covid vaccines but that dude can literally burn a million everyday and he'll still be a billionare. He doesnt need money, period.</p>
<p>'They want to kill us etc from the vaccine' also complete BS. There's 100s of ways that they can kill us all and also more efficient. </p>
<p>They can poison the water supply, our medicine, food, the air etc. </p>
<p>I just dont know the answer and i'm done trying. I'll see how it goes until the summer and remember, the truth ALWAYS comes out</p></p>

        <p>The vaccine isn't about hurting anyone (not like they care if that's a side effect).  It's about control.  It always has been and always will be.</p>
<p>Lockdowns were never about slowing the spread.  They were about control.</p>

        <p>Poisoning the water supply isn't targeted enough for these people. Same thing for poisoning medicine, food, the air... you really need to think on this issue quite a bit more.</p>
<p>These people do not want to do things that could hit themselves or their families. Only other people which is why a vaccine that they will just get a water shot or saline is the PERFECT way to target people for depopulation.</p>
<p>Especially when it is done for a virus that kills so few people 50 and under.</p>

        <p>Speaking with my family extensively this past week has been a very similar experience.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, my mother will complain about one of her favourite stores being closed.  I shrug my shoulders and say, "well, what did you think was going to happen?"</p>
<p>Then she realizes she's just proven exactly everything I've been saying for months.  But instead of agreeing with me she'll change the subject and say, "well, it will be back in a few months."</p>
<p>Sigh...</p>
<p>It will not be back in a few months.</p>
<p>These people still haven't gotten it.  And if they haven't gotten it by now, they probably aren't going to get it.</p>
<p>I agree with you.  It fucking sucks.  Not only does it make want to give up trying to convince these people, it makes me also not want to save them.  </p>

        <p>1) It gave a pretext for mail in ballots which helped Joe Biden. They enabled vote fraud and if they are made permanent then certain people can always win American elections by cheating. The US is probably the most powerful country in the world so there is a huge incentive for this. There is evidence Biden was bribed by China, did they release the virus to make him president? Trump’s economy had to be destroyed and wiped from the history books so certain people could stay in power.</p>
<p>2) It has benefitted the most powerful corporations at the expense of small businesses. At the very least many of them are shielded from the worst of the lockdowns making them biased. Did it benefit corporations owned by China?</p>
<p>3) Politicians need to be seen as doing something to not be blamed for Covid deaths. By positioning themselves as having the solutions to Covid, people become more dependent on them in their fearful state. They can demonize their opponents on the other side of the issue to increase their support. It undermines the culture of individual rights while the fear makes people more accepting of big government.</p>

        <p>It’s the control, the governments can do almost anything now with these lockdowns. People aren’t “violent towards the government” most people praise the government for the illusion of safety and security. The other people are too scared to do anything and you can’t blame them. They’ll lose their whole life like their job, house, etc if they disobey. A fearful population is easy to control. Authoritarian tyranny.</p>

        <p>You must have no student debt if you can just walk away. My impending debt meant once I entered that tunnel, there was no way out but the other side. I heard something strange about billionaires. The worlds 2nd richest person is always trying to become #1. They would never be satisfied like you or I. So they’re always after something.. makes no sense to someone like me.</p>
