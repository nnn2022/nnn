    <strong>I'm At Risk</strong>
    <p><p>Of having a complete mental breakdown. Of never seeing my grandparents again. Of alienating my brainwashed friends and family due to my outspoken beliefs. Of losing my job. Of high blood pressure because of the constant state of fucking anger I find myself in. Of power-tripping police officers truncheoning people for sitting on a park bench. Of brainwashed NPCs harassing me online and offline for not following the arbitrary rules to the fucking letter. Of politicians prolonging the "pandemic". Of being forced to take an experimental vaccine of which we don't know the long term effects. Of the possible (probable) side-effects of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Of anything and everything BUT the fucking thing I'm supposed to be afraid of. It's time to end this. Fuck Mark Drakeford. Fuck Fauci. And fuck you if you think lockdowns and face-masks are the fucking silver bullet here. The lazy fucks in charge have done less than the bare minimum and put zero thought or effort into fighting this "pandemic". It's the fucking flu, get the fuck over it. I shouldn't have to suffer for your ignorance and anxiety. I don't care if you're scared: grow a sack.</p></p>

        <p>I’m sorry you have to go through this. I’m in the same boat. </p>
<p>I hope you remember that you are on the right side of history. And remember that the pain you and everyone else like you is going through right now is worth it if it gives us a chance at winning back our liberty. </p>
<p>It takes incredible strength to stand your ground when almost everyone else is against you, and to keep fighting for freedom even though it would be easier to just comply and wallow in ignorance like most everyone else. Remember your place and keep being sane.</p>

        <p>Being forced into taking a vaccine we don’t need with unknown side effects is scary. Thalidomide coming to my mind. What if the next generation has a lowered intelligence and more like drones.... it’s scary. </p>
<p>I just hope my mind is strong enough to resist any of the worst things this vaccine can do.... nanobots and microchips? Terrible. I might have a bit of Asperger’s, hope it stops me from being mind controlled. I hope the gods give me the clarity to resist the propaganda. There’s this kind of cyborg enemy in one of my video games that apparently have microchips that force them to experience the brainwashing of the particular villainous corporation they work for. </p>
<p>It’s one of those companies that appear to be good but really aren’t. It’s Champions Online if you’re curious about the game</p>

<p>True words my friend. This is what they want, to separate us and make us choose sides.</p>

        <p>As a former socialist, it's not that bad.  Slow down and try to get yourself into a more positive mindset.  I live in a state that votes Republican so depending on where you live it could be a lot worse for you, I don't know.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that you're going to be forced to take the vaccine. I was recently reading about it because my girlfriend is a front end manager and centrist dad (Hillary and Biden voting RINO) says he thinks that retail businesses should make the vaccine mandatory so they can tell their customers that all their employees have been vaccinated.  While any business could make their employees get the vaccine, I think it will be unlikely because of all the legal hurdles they'd have to go through.  Their vaccine records have to be HIPAA compliant and any side effects or complications would likely be treated as work related injuries.  Plus any time spent getting vaccinated would likely be treated as work time and require payment.  Plus if you have Abrahamic religious beliefs you can say it's the mark of the beast and get an easy religious accommodation.  I'm a recovering atheist so it would be easy for me but I don't work with the public so I doubt it would be an issue.</p>
<p>You could also consider just not telling other people what your opinions are and not debating people if it causes you stress.</p>
<p>I've told centrist dad and my girlfriend's uncle who is an actual conservative and is trying to talk me into getting the vaccine that I might get it in a few years from now once we've had time to observe it.  Creepy uncle says that I just just get it when it becomes available because I'll need to get it anyway, according to his words.</p>
