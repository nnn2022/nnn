    <strong>I love this subreddit..</strong>
    <p><p>I have been trying to resist the mob stupidity dragging us into this medically branded authoritarian nightmare for the last year and I've felt so alone, outnumbered and overwhelmed, often totally hopeless..</p>
<p>i pretty much still do except for NOT alone at least ;)</p>
<p>i mean i have a handful of friends who have their brains too but i mostly talked to them on facebook and i got suspended for the last month and most of my posts over there are deleted on a regular basis anyway, can't even share my thoughts there without regular suspensions..</p>
<p>i only had one other sub that had like 50/50 resistance over there but its another topic entirely, it just coincidentally had 50% overlap with .. having a clue on THIS tyranny.. (which was alot lower than i would've hoped..)</p>
<p>but its great to find a place where you can find like minded THINKERS and people with a respect for truth, liberty, common sense, science, facts, consistency..  and just plain NORMALCY</p>
<p>got into some arguments today that normally would've given me -200 downvotes but instead they are NOT buried entirely or at all lol so thats a WOW moment for me, actually helped lessen the tightening in my chest i usually get trying to chat to people online these days about these topics..</p>
<p>glad to have stumbled into it</p>
<p>actually got referred here after i tore into some idiot wearing a 'keep calm' shirt while getting his vaccine.., glad i did.. the irony of a guy wearing that shirt from an era where people literally wouldn't let BOMBS stop them, while he is so terrified of a disease with 99.95% survival that he wants to get injected with a barely tested experimental "vaccine"<em>cough</em>(bioweapon) was just too much for me to hold back</p></p>

        <p>Haha ya. I had an alt fb I had around 2500 ppl Iâ€™d added. It was amazing bc they interacted with me like real friends and completely unlike my main account where I was blasted over a post when all this first started. Anyway my alt got taken down too. I was thrilled to find this sub but I expect it to either get taken down or to be booted off Reddit.</p>

        <p>IMO.</p>
<p>people on this sub are of the "live and let live" stripe.</p>
<p>you can believe and behave as you like, just don't put it on others.</p>
<p>a person can come here and say "i believe all that the media tells me"</p>
<p>and that's ok, it's when they start calling us names or saying we "spread misinformation" is where they run afoul .</p>
<p>we are discussing our view and sharing.  people come in here willingly. </p>
<p>it seems "spreading information" would require some sort of broadcast.</p>
<p>i  don't have to agree with you to respect you, and that's how we would like to be treated.</p>

        <p>ya im a libertarian, thats basically 'live and let live' lol long as you mind your business and don't try and force your ideas on me violently its great</p>
<p>unfortunately this last year there were alot of terrible ideas forced on EVERYONE.. and still yet more terrible ideas they are trying to force now...</p>
<p>the chilling thing is how many people went along with it, and abanadoned all reason and principle to impose them on others too...</p>
<p>never realized how many of those surrounding us have absolutely zero respect for the most foundational principles of civilization</p>

        <p>I just found it yesterday after someone tagged the sub calling it a place for conspiracy nuts. I find conspiracy theories interesting from time to time. (Did we really land on the moon, or was it a hollywood stunt to one up Russia?) So ofc I had to check the sub out. Looked at the first couple posts and all I saw was people posting memes that were actually accurate. I felt kinda deceived.</p>

<p>There is a massive misinformation campaign being orchestrated by people who want to shut the sub down and they often just blatantly lie about the sub. Welcome aboard.</p>

        <p>&rt; or was it a hollywood stunt to one up Russia?</p>
<p>It was.  They even got Stanley Kubrick to direct and act as DP.  It got really expensive because Kubrick was such a perfectionist, he insisted on shooting the scene on the moon.</p>

        <p>I initially was following the recommendations and worried about people not wearing masks and gathering in large crowds. </p>
<p>There were a lot of things that did not make sense which made me question why the media was making this pandemic seem so terrible. Especially when they deemed hydroxychloroquine to be bunk, and refused to use it in hospitals in my state and the riots over last summer.  Dr. Fauci being a giant jackass didn't help either.  Eventually, I saw more studies and realized the pro-mask, lockdown, and vaccine people did not have a foot to stand on. They either censor you, use ad homeniem attacks, or are in denial when sources are shown.</p>
<p>People in real life have a little more sense then what's shown on google, reddit, twitter, etc.</p>

        <p>its crazy right? after a very short amount of time i lost all confidence in human intelligence..</p>
<p>not one single person was adopting this new inhuman strategy with a single shred of reason or evidence.. and none of them seemed to realize how insanely irrational it was.. instead they wanted me to prove a negative, and gave no burden of proof to the people wanting to entirely change everything about the way everyone lives world wide..</p>
<p>there wasn't a single study or review or anything that showed the masks worked even a little until november (and its cherry picked from china data) but until then not one </p>
<p>even 'experts' like fauci initially said masks don't work and were unnecessary for most of the whole first year, until he claimed he was lying to make sure there were enough masks for everyone and you need TWO masks..</p>
<p>but almost everyone just did whatever the media said.. and the media blatantly lied the entire time, based on ZERO actual evidence..  rights, norms, and history be ignored and damned..</p>
