    <strong>Personal Thinking on COVID Narrative</strong>
    <p><p>So this is my personal thinking based on logical reasoning about COVID-19, specifically about the restrictions.</p>
<p>So the mass public is repeatedly told that social distancing and mask wearing is extremely important to combating COVID. If there is a breach in the protocols given (ie not wearing a mask or not staying 6 ft away from someone) then the virus will spread and will quickly snowball into something that cannot be controlled.</p>
<p>If we take that as fact this leads one to make the conclusion that COVID-19 is an extremely dangerous disease that can spread extremely quickly. Nearly any and all social interaction carries the potential to infect one with the virus, thus social interactions must be avoided completely or done in an extremely modified manner.</p>
<p>Now let us take the "fact" that COVID-19 is extraordinarily contagious to its logical conclusion. Any reopening of society has the high likelihood having a case snowball effect (meaning that cases could rise above the threshold of control).</p>
<p>So, if COVID is extremely dangerous and highly contagious this leads one of two things to be true about the disease. 1: the only true way to ensure that COVID is kept under control is to have long-term lock downs where a majority of people have little to no social interactions. Ezekiel Emanuel was a proponent of this:</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/07/ezekiel_emanuel_us_must_stay_locked_down_for_12-18_months_until_theres_a_vaccine.html#!">https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/07/ezekiel_emanuel_us_must_stay_locked_down_for_12-18_months_until_theres_a_vaccine.html#!</a>)</p>
<p>2: COVID is not as dangerous as previously thought, because upon reopening there was not a surge of deaths and the rise in cases was handled by the medical system.</p>
<p>Upon taking option two as true, masks and other such extreme restrictions are not needed, due to the understanding that COVID-19 is not the new "Black Plague" or "Spanish Flu". Once society did reopen (abet in a limited fashion), cases did rise; but there was not a proportional amount of rise in deaths.</p>
<p>I am not advocating for a willy-nilly do whatever you want, kind of reopening. What I believe the best option forward is making sure that the vulnerable and elderly are protected fully, and other common sense measures. If we do that, we can quickly end this nightmare, without trampling on peoples' human rights and free choice.</p></p>

        <p>I mean your reasoning is sound and is very much how this should be being handled.</p>
<p>The initial plan in the UK was to flatten the curve so hospitals were not overwhelmed. We made a mess of it by shifting the vulnerable out of hospitals into care homes which contributed to a high death toll.<br>
But now ICU usage for COVID19 patients is very low across our countries and actual deaths occurring now are very low (contrary to reported deaths as they are based on deaths from weeks ago) especially in hospitals.</p>
<p>The fact we were not enforcing masks outside or during much of the lockdown inside and mass gatherings occurred with no uptick in deaths or even cases does lend credence to the idea that it is not at the dangerous end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Even are current apparent increase in cases is actually inline with an increase in testing, in fact if you graph such you see that <code>new cases / new tests</code> is about 0.6% and is remaining steady at that amount (it dropped from about 1.5% at the start of June).</p>

        <p>Thank you for the compliment. It's always nice to know that my logic is indeed sound.</p>
