    <strong>Why do you want to be kept alive to not be allowed to have fun?</strong>
    <p><p>What's the point of trying to be one of those people who follow what the CDC or government says to the letter? Not being able to travel unless you go get tested, wear a mask, "quarantine" for 2 weeks and keep your distance from people.  </p>
<p>You've been fine and alive up until this point. Heck the virus has already been around with us for a while. You're still alive and kicking, but you want to thank the restrictions and masks for that? It just means you have a solid immune system that doesn't need the mask or even the vaccine for that matter. Why are you so concerned over taking it WHEN THE FACT IS YOUR ALIVE. Are you that worried that you survived this long only to be scared of the Delta Plus variant or whatever the heck variant it is now. VARIANTS JUST INCREASE TRANSMISSION THEY DON'T INCREASE THE CHANCES OF YOU DIEING. VARIANTS JUST INCREASE THE ODDS OF YOU CATCHING IT, BUT IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GET IT AND RECOVER YOU'RE FINE!!   </p>
<p>You think it's good to just go to work, barely be able to afford your rent or home due to the rise of inflation and stay isolated from everyone? Not being able to do what you love because one of the things you love like travel, dancing, etc. is considered "risky" so you won't do it? Sorry to me that isn't a life worth living if the only things you can do is go to work and then come home. I bet you a solid majority of these people who want you to follow the government and or CDC to the letter has started drinking, taking drugs, increased their drinking intake, increased their drug intake, accepted their life is miserable and now wants everyone to struggle like they are so they don't feel like a failure since they can relate to other people, etc.   </p>
<p>GO OUT! HAVE FUN! YOU ONLY HAVE ONE FUCKING LIFE! STOP WORRYING ABOUT SOME VIRUS THAT YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER IF YOU GET IT OR NOT!  </p>
<p>LIVE YOUR LIFE!!!!!</p></p>
