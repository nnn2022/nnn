    <strong>I think we can win this or at least start heading in the right direction</strong>
    <p><p>I know we lost a ton of rights after the government took advantage of the fear mongering after 9/11 and they’re doing the same thing now but I’m hopeful. No one I talk too at work really believes in any of this lockdown/mask nonsense. Yes there are a few who do but they’re not a majority whatsoever.</p>
<p>I think the way we win is with our mouths and our money. Speak up for your opinion on masks and lockdowns, don’t be afraid but most importantly don’t be a dick. If someone disagrees with your opinion, that’s fine, no need to yell or insult, be the bigger man.</p>
<p>I think money is the most important tactic we can take. Put your money where your mouth is. Corporations have taken a woke angle the past few years, not because they actually care about any of those issues but because they think they will make more money from people who support woke rather than people who will boycott them. So try your best to support businesses that when you walk in and out with a mask and nobody says shit. Try to avoid if possible places that strictly enforce mask rules. Now I know that’s impossible but don’t be afraid to speak your mind and still capitulate. When I say speak your mind, I mean let your opinion be heard but don’t be a dick. </p>
<p>People who lose their shit because of having to put on their mask are doing us no favors. I appreciate them being on our side but I hate how they make us look, and I really hope they represent a small percentage of us. I walk around all kinds of stores with no masks all the time. It’s rare anyone says anything to me. But when they tell me to put my mask on I say “sure”. Why you ask? Because I’m a nice person and you gotta kill them with kindness. We’re supposed to be the assholes remember? The Karen’s? Whatever you wanna try to label us as. Well I’m not an asshole, I’d I’ll never treat someone the way the some of these maskers say they wanna treat some of us online. You don’t know that the minimum wage worker you’re screaming at is just worried about their boss yelling at them for not enforcing masks and now they got you yelling at them on top of it, come on. Are there workers doing it because they like this little taste of power of telling people what to do, probably some but I don’t think they make up the majority. </p>
<p>In summary, we’re gonna win this mind game war, and we’re gonna get our old reality back, not this garbage boring dystopian.</p>
<p>Put your money where your mouth is. Give your money to the business’s and people who identify with your sense of liberty and reality.</p>
<p>Most important of all, be a good person. Make us look like the people/side that actually does care about others. It could be as small as holding a door open for someone or shoveling snow for a neighbor.</p>
<p>Side note:
I think we as a community should make a list of places to avoid and places to support.</p></p>

        <p>Is there a list of businesses that don’t require masks? I understand if not as that’s kinda like putting a bullseye on your back, but if there is I’d love to know! ESP in California</p>

        <p>I’m talking about businesses that won’t say anything if you don’t wear a mask. They’ll have signs up because they have too but the internal company policy is not to tell anyone to wear a mask.</p>
