    <strong>if venting is allowed, i need to for a moment</strong>
    <p><p>i won't delve into my opinions regarding the pandemic, but i needed a place to vent about my mental health because of it. i'm in what's considered a high risk category so i do have to take precautions, but i think i'm starting to lose it. if i talked about this anywhere else i'd probably get met with 'At LeAsT yOu'Re AlIvE'. </p>
<p>i thought i was making progress prior to this year. i have asperger's and severe anxiety to the point it qualifies as a disability. i was building up confidence and hoping to go to community college and start my career. i got into a good workout regime. now i feel like i'm back at square one. i'm extremely introverted with no friends in real life who regularly meet with me aside from my boyfriend, who lives with me. i feel more and more i'm drifting towards something like crazy. i keep dissociating and feeling really numb, like physically numb. i keep having covid like symptoms; chest tight, brain fog, trouble breathing, fatigue and pain. i can no longer tell if it's mental or physical. my emotional support animals died and i can't afford more. i have nowhere to go and probably nothing look forward to next year if the financial situation keeps up the way its going. i can't afford therapy (or even go, obviously). i'm grateful for what i <em>do</em> have, but irrational mental illness can't do the same.</p>
<p>what are some of you all doing to keep your mental health in check? i have no way of going out (can't drive and no money/nobody to see). i keep feeling more and more self hatred. the anxiety is eating me alive. i'm not suicidal, but i'm just so tired of being constantly tired. i can't sleep or enjoy anything without feeling sick at some point during, or being excruciatingly self critical. i just really hope i can make it out of six more months of this.</p></p>
