    <strong>Just got a ban from Justice Served for contributing to NoNewNormal</strong>
    <p><p>I guess justice has been served then. Hahahaha :) I rarely visited there anyway and they can go **** themselves quite frankly. What sort of sub bans people simply because they contribute to another sub that they don't like. It's like being back in the playground. :)</p>
