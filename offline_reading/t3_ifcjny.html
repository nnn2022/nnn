    <strong>The wedding sub is fucking pathetic right now</strong>
    <p><p>My sister's getting married in October, and so I decided to browse that sub to get some ideas for my bridesmaid dress. And holy shit, you should see the number of people that are choosing to postpone! Even for smaller weddings with under 50 guests or so. They're all like, "Oh yeah, we've moved it from September 2020 to September 2021," several months down the road, and my question is, <em>how can you be sure the paranoia will have passed by THEN?</em></p>
<p>I can't even express to you how pissed off I am that people are expected to indefinitely postpone some of the most important events of their lives. Especially considering we have NO idea when this will end! When the panic will end, more like it. The virus is likely always going to be here. It's fucking disgusting that people are being shamed for simply wanting to live their lives. By all means, if you're a high risk guest, don't feel pressured to come. My family has discussed this as well, we don't want people who are at serious risk attending the wedding. We wouldn't shut them out, of course, but we've made it clear that they're under no obligation to attend if they feel unsafe. </p>
<p>But the rest of us have every fucking right to go ahead with it. How many times do I have to say this???  It is ILLOGICAL to expect the whole world to shut down for a virus with a &lt;1% mortality rate. Those that are vulnerable should isolate, but the rest of us have to get on with our lives. You think that's selfish? Lol. Say the ones who demand the rest of us stay shut in our homes for god knows how long because THEY are afraid. </p>
<p>I'm so over this shit I'm honestly starting to becoming enraged. I feel more and more disgust for humanity each day, and am quickly losing empathy.</p></p>

        <p>One industry that will die out of this is the wedding industry. It’s so hard to justify an expenditure like that in one day when it gets suspended for a few years and nobody dies from not spending that money</p>

        <p>I'm actually ok with this, because if the sheep think that next year will be better for their wedding, they're in for a really big surprise. By then their guests will probably need a gas mask or vaccination certification. Whatever the conditions are, it will be worse. Serves them right for being sheep.</p>

        <p>Exactly. It would be one thing to postpone if we KNEW FOR CERTAIN things were going to be okay by X date, but think about it, back in March, who the hell would have guessed that we'd still be in this shit come August? That just tells me this doomer nonsense might be dragged out for several more months to come, and I for one refuse to play their game anymore. We can't live like this forever.</p>

        <p>oh no! have you looked at shopbop and anthropologie? i know you said it will be a smaller wedding, so maybe you don't have to wear a traditional bridesmaids's dress. both sites always have lots of cute dresses with a little bit of flair, and usually some decent sales.</p>
<p>an October wedding sounds like such a fun idea - focus on how special that is for your sister and future brother-in-law, and cherish the opportunity you will get to share with the guests that do come. throw down! rock out! dance your butt off! </p>
<p>do not let the doomers steal your joy. don't let them ruin your sister's special day. no, we can't keep asking everyone to postpone everything all the damn time. (that's insane. also it breaks the laws of physics because time only goes one way. )</p>
<p>the best way to spite these people is to keep on righteously living to your fullest, out in the open.</p>

        <p>Thanks. Yes, I've checked both those sites, but ended up finding one elsewhere. Thank God at least that piece is done!</p>

        <p>Not complaining about it since all the cancellations meant I could get a slot for my last minute shotgun wedding. We paid the venue under the table and just had our “reception” at my in laws and had a barbecue. But yeah postponing something like that is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Yeah the venue wasn’t supposed to have anyone but they were struggling so we paid in cash. We said no masks and the venue said we can do whatever we want but if someone got sick, our ceremony never happened.</p>
