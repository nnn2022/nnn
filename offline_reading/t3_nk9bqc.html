        <p>My coworker got vaccinated and had a 3 hour bloody nose the same day. He has never had a bloody nose before.</p>

        <p>Ask yourself why something that's supposed to be boosting your immunity is effecting your blood pressure or blood thinning, why it's effecting the hormones of woman regarding their periods, and why it's killing some people.</p>
<p>Our DNA is our genetic coding. Having a vaccine that plays God by recoding it through mRNA just sounds like it is prone to too many possible errors.</p>
<p>All I know from my computer coding experience is that code is extremely vulnerable to small, seemingly insignificant, mistakes. 1 tiny error, even a typo, can completely ruin everything.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how that translate biologically, but I feel as though the consequences can be far more drastic. DNA coding is, after all, far more complicated than computer coding. Cancer is literally a result of a tiny error in your DNA, and that just happens naturally through either the process of aging or by radiation interfering.</p>
<p>A vaccine purposefully meant to mess with that is not a risk I'm willing to take until we see the long term 5+ year consequences of. Especially compared to a disease I survived and likely have immunity to, a disease that has an average age of death equal to your normal life expectancy. </p>
<p>There are clearly some mistakes present in the short term regarding the vaccine. A 3 hour long bloody nose may not seem like much, but it hints at an imperfect product. As do all the other side effects that I'm sure you'll brush past.</p>
<p>I can only hope there's no long term mistakes that become evident.</p>
<p>Personally, until the vaccine is FDA approved, and, if the virus turns out not to have been created in a gain of function experiment like current studies and even Dr Fauci (reluctantly) are showing more and more evidence of, then I'll consider getting it. </p>
<p>Also, if there are no vaccine passports, as the notion of such a thing goes against so many rights and freedoms it honestly should be an embarrassment to the twats that are advocating for it.</p>
<p>But hey, you do you. Your body your choice.</p>
<p>My body my choice, so fuck off.</p>

        <p>nobody thinks the vaccines are microchips.<br>
that is a conspiracy that was spread around to make anyone questioning it look stupid.<br>
they ARE making microchips that can "detect covid 19" [their own words] [also basically a vaccine 'passport' at the same time] but no, they aren't administered with the vaccine. but to 'prove' you're healthy you'd 'need' the chip, in the near future.  </p>
<p>&rt;You forgetting the OUTRAGEOUS infection rate  </p>
<p>riight. determined by people who phone in sick, and test results, from PCR testing - that were proven to be getting ran at 40+ CTs, which even anthony fauci himself said would produce false positives, as anything 'found' would be [IN HIS OWN WORDS] dead nucleoids, and hence not even able to spread.  </p>
<p>&rt;overcrowded hospitals</p>
<p>fear mongering. also, a lot of hospitals reportedly had to get rid of/store away some stuff """due to covid, somehow""", hence reducing their overall capacity. even with reduced capacity, hospitals have not been overwhelmed, in most cases.<br>
there are some- filled with idiots who think they have covid because of a headache, and hypochondriacs who think they have covid for no reason.  </p>
<p>other than that- business as usual.  </p>
<p>&rt;its efficient ability to mutate</p>
<p>..you.. you mean like the common cold?<br>
seriously.  </p>
<p>&rt;and its long term effects</p>
<p>it's been almost 2 years. what long term effects we talking here, from basically a cold?<br>
and it's ironic that you'll say this, but anyone concerned with long-term effects from the vaccine you call crazy.  </p>
<p>&rt;Pick up a literal book.</p>
<p>I read all the time.<br>
you ever read the book "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L Shirer"?<br>
good read. suggest you see what happens when you draw parallel to the tactics being used by the MSM right now.  </p>
<p>&rt;You're not special because you're endangering others. </p>
<p>nobodies saying we're special here. we're just normal people, some above average, some below, but overall, we're just regular people.<br>
we're not endangering others by living and breathing. you're insane for thinking that.  </p>
<p>&rt;You're just stupid.</p>
<p>all yall ever do is throw insults. back atcha mdude. if you can't see through really really basic manipulation tactics, then I'd have to assume you're young, impressionable, and of a low intelligence.</p>

99% of the people who come here like you, come here just to argue/namecall/throw insults/ridicule us, with absolutely no open mind.<br>
it's called brigading and it's against reddit rules, and against this subs rules, too.<br>
the entire NoNewNormal<strong>Ban</strong> sub is literally founded on brigading.<br>

<p>cool. good for you.<br>
go do that, alone. I'm gonna live my life. suicides have skyrocketed worldwide because of this tyrannical bullshit.<br>
yall claim it's about saving lifes but for you it's actually about "not looking like a trump supporter"<br>
your arguments are insane and are based solely on bullshit fed to you by the people we're telling you shouldn't be trusted.  </p>

end the lockdowns, mask wearings, etc.<br>

        <p>So you'd be against seatbelts? Most health professionals advise that masks are worn. Just cause a dozen go against it, doesn't mean there's some whole manipulation tactic going on. I don't see you as delusional because you're distrustful of everything that's going on. I see you as such because you think that this is some convoluted plot to slowly take away all of our freedoms for some reason. I don't measure the severity of COVID by its deaths. There's no faking how infectious it is and the overcrowded hospitals. And stop with "the media told you so" because your sources don't have some special gloss that protects them from being stupid either. You want us to stop seeing you as delusional? Then maybe stop thinking we're mindless sheep who take things without a grain of salt.</p>

There's literally an entire paragraph about how testing results for people with symptoms are actually reliable, far more than the data they showed indicates. The CDC only recommends that one takes a test when they are symptomatic or been in close proximity with an infected individual. Never do they recommend that you take a test randomly, when you aren't experience symptoms and haven't been in contact. </p>
<p>Even then, the false-positive cases are extremely low <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/main/2020/09/cycle-threshold-values-sars-cov2-pcr.pdf%3Fla%3Den&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjK6vvf-eTwAhUYbs0KHc4xDOUQFjAAegQIBxAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tLu10S6F2N1z0AKyrjocJ">according to Ontario Health</a>. False negatives are what seem to be more inaccurate, but steps are taken to reduce the inaccuracy. After 8 days of infection are <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-1495">inaccuracies the lowest</a> and health professionals literally <a href="https://www.peelregion.ca/coronavirus/symptoms/#contact">advise</a> that you come 9 days after initial contact to reduce inaccuracies of false-negatives.</p>

        <p>also, yes, there is faking how infectious it is. PCR testing was done at over 40 CT, which results in false positives. they even admitted this themselves.</p>
<p>faking the overcrowded hospitals? easily.</p>
<p>take away some capacity from hospitals, stage some scenes to scare people on mainstream media. wouldn't be the first time they did this...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and no, I don't think all the sources I've had are 100% correct. it's always good to be skeptical. but mainstream media has consistently lied for years. it's illogical to trust them at face value.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and yes, this is PRECISELY how, they would take away freedoms.</p>
<p>they can't do it like it's been done before- it'd be considered rash, and too many would revolt.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but they can do it even BETTER now that there's so many people online and consuming msm.</p>
<p>for 'some reason'? it's pretty simple.</p>
<p>they consider themselves the elites, and us the peasants.</p>
<p>the peasants should do whatever the elites want, according to them.</p>
<p>but ooo- human rights and freedoms and laws against tyranny..</p>
<p>but what if everyone just gave away their rights?</p>

        <p>what- what would this elaborate attempt at creating a fake pandemic even do?? Why the hell would they want to take away our freedoms with just masks- I don't watch mainstream media either- but it's far more believable to believe an actual pandemic is occurring... rather than whatever theatrical stunt u think they're pulling here. Who is they? The government? Big corp? Why do they want to take our rights away in the first place??? This would mean MILLIONS of medical personnel would have to be included as well. Where do the vaccines even come into this- are they muscle relaxants or smth??? Are they trying to make us weaker I don't understand this- government officials aren't lizard people, they're uhhh people?</p>

        <p>also, the seatbelts have an observable, real protective outcome.</p>
<p>and this is false equivalency anyways.</p>
<p>if you really wanted to make this argument correct, you'd say that you should wear your seatbelt, outdoors, everywhere you go, with no car.</p>
<p>or even in your car, parked, alone, in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>definitely will help there!</p>
<p>PS</p>

the problem is you argue as if the governments and big pharma are people that give a flying fuck about the average person.<br>
they do not. the majority are evil, evil, people. and it seems apparent that their goal is essentially 'new' communism.<br>

        <p>So ur super anti-big corp and big pharma yet ur a capitalist? While communism is unrealistic in a modern society, it's something we should be striving towards... You seem to be afraid of an authoritarian or totalitarian government. And this is hard to comprehend. Masks have been historically implemented before and people like you have still protested against them. Did we turn into Nazi Germany back then? Ur acting like freedom and safety cannot co-exist. Nazi Germany wasn't trying to protect anyone??? They were trying to build an ideal fascist state by implementing white supremacy and using jews scapegoats. In this case wtf would be the scapegoat??? The virus???? It's very much real if that was ever even in question.</p>
<p>Implementing safety measures because of a LITERAL PANDEMIC isn't the start of a fascist nation. Do you suggest we let the virus roam free and let everyone die and have hospitals decide who gets to live and die cause they're too overcrowded?? I</p>
<p>Either way, it doesn't matter yall have convinced urselves ur woke untouchable pillars. I'm a sheep that clearly doesn't do their research well unless it's from the third page of Google and an isolated study with inconclusive findings. There is no way to win against you.

        <p>I'll repeat again. the only 'sources' yall post come directly from those we've said can't be trusted.</p>
<p>and it's not because we're paranoid- there's tons of scandals and lawsuits with the pharma companies intentionally selling/distributing dangerous drugs to people, they've been in court for crimes against humanity, etc.</p>
<p>"the central government" is something I hear from nearly *all* politicians a lot these days and it's pretty clear what they're getting at.</p>
<p>the "central" government is corrupt and would do whatever to keep power, and money, while keeping the people broke.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Everything I say or anything I send will have something wrong with it because if it's credible, it's clearly been altered with.</p>
<p>you say, but..</p>
<p>&rt;unless it's from the third page of Google and an isolated study with inconclusive findings.</p>
<p>you're being a hypocrite. just because one side is mainstream, popular, and gets spread around by media, doesn't mean EVERY OTHER SOURCE is false.</p>
<p>you act as though we're referencing quacks, but if we had referenced them prior to the "pandemic", you would've agreed that they're medical professionals with years of experience.</p>
<p>now anyone who isn't aligned with fauci to a T is a "wackjob".</p>
<p>"Nazi Germany wasn't trying to protect anyone??? "</p>
<p>no shit. neither is the government today.</p>
<p>they do things on the daily that harm the people, for money.</p>
<p>the restrictions have been all over the place and many make zero sense that it's clear it's not about safety at all.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Do you suggest we let the virus roam free and let everyone die and have hospitals decide who gets to live and die cause they're too overcrowded?</p>
<p>again, the hospitals being overcrowded was massively overblown in media, intentionally. it's in general, not the case, at all.</p>
<p>some have gotten reduced capacity, due to the government restrictions you claim is trying to help people..</p>
<p>and some have gotten some extra people who got false positives, headaches, or even just wanted two weeks off of work..</p>
<p>but overall, it's bullshit. it's fearmongering.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>also, at this point it's looking like the scapegoats, if you will, would be people LABELED "anti-vax", or "anti-masker".</p>
<p>anti-vax: no. you don't get to just decide that everyone who's against THIS vaccine, is suddenly totally anti-vax. many have had vaccines.</p>
<p>anti-masker: no.. this is absurd. you're either a masker, or just a regular person.</p>
<p>being normal and living your life doesn't make you evil.</p>
<p>&rt;Masks have been historically implemented before</p>
<p>like black plague? where they were widely ineffective, and might've even made things worse? ^(EDIT: I may have misspoke on this one, but I cba to check right now. a lot are like this though)</p>
<p>like spanish flu? in which most deaths were later found to actually have been from bacterial pneumonia or hypoxia, which wouldn't have happened without masks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>in a hospital?</p>
<p>they wear a hazmat suit when dealing with plagues/etc. NOT a freaking cloth mask.</p>
<p>they wear a cloth mask during surgery to prevent getting saliva/etc into peoples wounds..</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;While communism is unrealistic in a modern society, it's something we should be striving towards... You seem to be afraid of an authoritarian or totalitarian government.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>communism is and always has been unrealistic. nobody is perfect. everyone has agendas, and agendas change.</p>
<p>communism always leads towards something to the tune of north korea, communist china, nazi germany..</p>
<p>have you not learned anything from history?</p>
<p>your response has shown me nothing but that fear mongering and propaganda work on most people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>you can think I'm a nutjob til the day you die. but at the end of the day, I'm just a regular dude, trying to keep people from signing away their rights permanently.</p>
<p>I'd go on, but this post is already lengthy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>have a good one mate. stay safe, free, and healthy. edit out.</p>

        <p>Dr sherri tenpenny. Dr judy mikovits. Dr. Andrew caufield. Dr Carey Madej. Dr Sucharit Bhakdi, some of the names. There was a video with a panel of 30 doctors speaking out against this pandemic. PCR tests cannot diagnose Covid 19 and infectious diseases even said by the founder of the test himself, it only tests for genetic material - my doctor also told me this. You have the president of Tanzania saying PCR tests diagnosed a goat and fruits for covid 19.</p>
<p>Death certificates being manipulated - non-covid 19 deaths being put as covid 19 deaths, doctors that spoke out against that lost their medical license. NHS nurse spoke out saying they are committing ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù. My friend‚Äôs dad who died from late stage cancer, was placed covid 19 in his death certificate. He told me he did not die from Covid.</p>
<p>One of the ex scientific advisor of pfizer, the vaccine company you are supporting said ‚Äúthe government is lying to you that may lead to your death‚Äù</p>
<p>Random celebrities dropping dead after taking the covid 19 vaccine. DMX, Larry King. </p>
<p>Are you living under a rock? Obviously you won‚Äôt search for this information because you want to close your eyes like 90% of this world and all of these videos uploaded got removed from Youtube and are now being hosted in another site. If you want i can send it all to u, you can DM me and take a look for yourself but you probably won‚Äôt because you are too scared to open your eyes to what is really going on.</p>
