    <strong>Problem. Reaction. Solution (How dictators convince us to willingly give up our liberty and freedoms and trade it in for big government and promises of safety)</strong>
    <p><p>If you are confused by what's going on and feel it <strong><em>in your gut</em></strong> that we are being played, start researching anybody that has been labeled a conspiracy theorist. </p>
<p><strong>Question everything and the truth will unfold naturally.</strong>  We don't know the answers, we don't even <em>need</em> to know the answers, but if we question everything we've been told and start thinking for ourselves, the truth will slowly creep out of our questions. </p>
<p>It's that easy.</p>
<p>Start with researching this: </p>
<p><strong>Problem. Reaction. Solution</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Terrorism. Fear.  NSA, TSA, &amp; Homeland Security</li>
<li>Virus. Fear.  Masks, Track &amp; Trace, Mandatory Vaccines, Cashless Society</li>
<li>Mass Shootings. Fear. Repeal 2nd Amendment rights</li>
<li>Misinformation. Fear. Censorship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to add to this list as your questions begin to expose the truth.</p></p>

        <p>I really noticed this after 9-11.  Be scared, fear Muslim terrorists, Homeland Security, TSA checkpoints, take off your shoes and belts, put liquids in tiny bottles, clear bags at concerts and sporting events, FISA courts, NSA spying, blah blah blah for your safety. Endless wars and killings in the middle east for the war on terror. So many dead American and allied soldiers, and god only knows how many dead in the middle east.</p>
<p>Then, flip the script.  Less than ten years later you're a horrible bigot asshole if you don't want a bunch of Muslims coming into the country.  You're racist and hateful and awful if you don't love Muslims.  A massive migrant crisis caused largely by the endless war on terror for our safety but now we're supposed to forget all that and open the doors to the same people we were told are terrorists. If you've read 1984, you know we've always been at war with east asia.  It's that 180 turnabout that the people aren't supposed to notice and largely don't.  But for those of us who notice it's infuriating and stunning in their audacity.</p>
<p>That right there, this obvious mind fuck perpetrated by our governments on the people told me that NONE of it is what it seems to be.  Those predatory and malevolent assholes will tell the people whatever fantasy they think we'll believe to support their agenda.  They (in the middle east) don't hate us for our freedoms; they hate us for being murderous, thieving parasites who destroyed their lands for a fake war on terror.</p>
<p>I have a child who was born shortly after 9-11 who has no idea what life was like before that time.  Who accepts being checked and patted down like a criminal when traveling or going to a major event.  Who had her laptop taken because she forgot to put it in the correctly sorted bag.  Who was emotionally scarred by active shooter drills.  Not at all the life I had growing up.  </p>
<p>Now this coronavirus pandemic bullshit.  Problem. Reaction. Solution.</p>
<p>It will only get much worse.  Why?  Because we continue to let those evil bastards get away with it.</p>

        <p>The truth that you eventually end up at is that the era of free societies is coming to an end. The state is slowly gathering power and disarming the populace, all while they build the legal and physical infrastructure for a future totalitarian state behind the scenes.</p>

        <p>It's good to question, and often if something is labeled "conspiracy theory" it means you're right over the target.  But be aware that a lot of noise has been injected into the system.  A lot of what you'll find is truth mixed with lies that are meant to mislead.</p>
<p>What is also necessary is a level of discernment that can only come from developed intuition, from familiarity with the silence between being and language-mediated thought.</p>
