<p>You mean like all the people who willingly go out into public, and then bitch at people and businesses, demanding that everyone else be as terrified and paranoid as they are? If you truly cared about saving lives, you wouldn't ever step foot in public.</p>
<p>&rt;COVID denying protests </p>
<p>So there are protests going on that are all about proclaiming that this virus isn't real? Lol no one legitimately thinks this virus doesn't exist. Hell, this sub is all about recognizing that it's a very real thing, and how the reaction to the virus has been.. not ideal.</p>

        <p>I get what your saying, and the Death Star was not a justifiable thing. But if you’re going to hold that type of action against the Empire, shouldn’t you also hold it against the terrorists? The Death Star II was not even done being built once it was attacked, so there were probably innocent contractors on that station, casualties of a war they had nothing to do with. The rebellion just destroyed it anyway, as always, not caring who they hurt or killed.</p>

        <p>All the workers there were likely clones, cloned specifically for certain trades.  Anyone who was not a clone was a command post and I'm okay with those losses.  Ultimately we saw in clone wars cartoons that clones can have personalities so maybe they have their own souls and killing them really was murder.  I'm not a philosopher.  However, the question I asked was what was the benefit to Luke in blowing up the death star?</p>

        <p>They only blew it up in that instance because it was attacking the Rebellion’s planet. The Empire didn’t just destroy random planets, just ones with extremists stationed on them. That’s the only reason the rebellion cared</p>
