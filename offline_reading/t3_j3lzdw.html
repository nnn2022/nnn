    <strong>What part of the “new normal” do you most object to?</strong>
    <p><p>I know....I know.... barely new account....</p>
<p>I’ve spent the day reading over this sub, and I’m actually very interested by many of your perspectives.
Many of them are things that have crossed my own mind.</p>
<p>If it’s allowed, may I ask.....what specific part of the “new normal” do you must object to? Why? And where are you from (country)?</p></p>

        <p>From Canada... masks are the worst, because I have trouble breathing in some of them (asthma) and I hate not being able to see other people's faces. It makes it hard to hear other people talking and I think other people are having a hard time hearing me, too.</p>

        <p>Yeah I can't understand anyone wearing a mask for the most part. I don't wear one and the fact they're tearing us apart makes it anxiety inducing to go out without one because I'm announcing myself as a non-supporter and they're getting more and more hate..as masks are a virtue signal.</p>

        <p>The utter disregard for the people suffering as a direct cause of lockdown measures (e.g. people who have lost their jobs, children whose natural social development has been thwarted, etc.)</p>
<p>On the balance my own life has actually been made a bit more comfortable because of lockdown - it has solved some major inconveniences while introducing only a few minor ones.  However, it isn't and shouldn't be all about me.  A lot of people are suffering a lot, and needlessly so.</p>

        <p>Every bit of it, to be honest... But the fact we're being told to see everyone around us as potential spreaders/infected people so it's best to stay away from all groups, effectively breaking everyone apart .. is intentional and an attempt to keep us from discussing skepticism etc.</p>
<p>Also the total disregard about the side effects of lockdowns and Covid Hysteria.
Economy crashes, uneducated children, job loss, homelessness, mental illness issues, drug dependency increases, domestic violence spikes, lack of healthcare being sought out, and so on.
Everything, the entire world, is supposed to be put on hold so that not even one case of the virus will show up.</p>

        <p>"From who ?" Each other.</p>
<p>We aren't supposed to talk to <em>each other</em> anymore. Right now we have the internet but as I don't know you, you don't know me... It's easy for me to tell you. "hey this is not adding up !" And you to just brush me off. If we were IRL friends/family/classmates and get to talking - we're more likely to trust one another, therefore opening up to the possibility this is all bullhockey.</p>
<p>They're putting teachers inside our homes via screen - teachers our children have never even had the chance to meet - and they're spying on our homes. 
They're claiming our private homes are extensions of public school during school hours.
They're taking away classmates, aunts, grandpas, because it's too dangerous to be together.
They're taking away holidays and concerts and dinners out because it's too dangerous to be together.</p>
<p>We are to stay in a very small nuclear group, only people we can trust are keeping as safe/socially distanced as we are, do mostly outdoor activities together - even though winter is coming up and that cold weather is going to have us hacking and carrying on ... And our children are either never going to real classrooms or they're going with never seeing the adults actual faces.</p>
<p>Who wants to talk too much when half your face is covered up anyway ?
How can I gauge if that stranger in Aisle 5 is trustworthy  to speak to if I can't read his face ? And can we whisper with both our faces covered up, six feet apart ?</p>
<p>It may sound dramatic as hell to some, and that's okay...but it's my full belief. I don't know if it <em>started</em> as an attempt to destroy our trust in one another and divide us between the DoGooders and Untrustworthies - clearly the virus itself is real as any other ol' thing - but were they truly that afraid in the beginning and quickly realized they can't waste a disaster so they continued it or did they simply take the opportunity of a simple virus they knew wasn't going to be a disaster to lie and fear monger from moment #1?</p>
<p>That's a long explanation and rant and I am absolutely no inside expert but for me when you ask <em>who?</em>, that's my answer. Each other - pick away at our humanity until we're even more controllable.</p>

        <p>I object the mask wearing the most. If the new normal is going to last permanently - especially if it lasts more than a decade - I will lose it. I don't mind hand washing after a bathroom visit, before and after eating etc. I don't mind hugging, kissing etc. being optional and that you only does it if you wants to - but if you're not a touchy person it's socially acceptable to not be touched.</p>
<p>I object the mask permanently because of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Makes communication harder. It limits the body language and facial expression, muffle the sounds etc. It makes it harder for deaf, autistic individuals and people with auditory processing disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's not helping disabled people like claustrophobic ones, people with anxiety etc. It affects people's mental health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harder to recognize people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People uses masks wrong because of they're not trained unlike doctors. They touch their face all the times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short supply to health professionals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>False sense of security. Masks won't protect you or others if you uses them wrongly, forgets washing your hands etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the past I used to be neutral on the issue, but understanding to the pro mask stance. After the idea has been tried out, I'm leaning to this shouldn't be normalized permanently. I'm not the typical anti-m because I see it as a concern of others wellbeing and not as a my personal freedom thing. Some people lip reads. That's okay. Some people have anxiety. That's also okay. It's about caring about others, not a purely selfish my freedom thing. Therefor masks shouldn't be normalized and used in every circumstances. Masks should mainly be used by medical professionals.</p>

        <p>Your mask perspective gives me a lot to think about.</p>
<p>1&amp;2 in particular.....It is kind of interesting that “we’ve” made so much progress with helping to normalize and make equitable accommodations for individuals like the ones you outlined in 1&amp;2, but we’ve had a hard time understanding making accommodations for them during this time.</p>
<p>I, personally, haven’t minded donning a mask when I’m at the grocery store or what not.... but I’m not everyone....</p>
<p>When people talk about wearing a mask being against their freedoms, it has really irritated me.... and I think that has made me a little bit polarized over time....</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing that perspective.</p>

        <p>True. Not everyone are the same. The lockdown has many serious consequences.</p>
<p>Patients with cancer, ALS and other medical conditions got their treatment delayed many places in the world because of the lockdown. People wants to keep us safe from the virus, but they failed hospital patients and they fails mental health. It's not black white. The lockdown may have some good outcomes, but also many bad ones.</p>

        <p>What (general) area of the world are you in?</p>
<p>In my state (rocky mountains), we weren’t very impacted during March and April.... and we didn’t have a super super strict lockdown... just a “stay home, stay safe” kind of narrative...</p>
<p>My SIL was able to still get her cancer treatments during that time... 
a friend had a baby in June and didn’t feel like she couldn’t have access to her doctor during that time.
A few months ago I was able to get a surgery (which was needed.... but arguably not 100% essential to get right at that moment)</p>
<p>I  know my experiences are anecdotal and may not be the experience everywhere.
I’m not saying what you’re saying isn’t true, I’m just curious how hospital stuff differed in different places.</p>
<p>——
The mental health stuff, 100%. 
I’ve been really “lucky”, but I absolutely have friends who the “virtual social” has just not worked well for them.
I kinda feel like more people are in that second camp than not.
And I very intensely feel that March/April especially, but still this time can only be an absolute hell for people in abusive relationships/households.</p>
<p>——-</p>
<p>When you say “the lockdown”, are you referring to March and April?  Or to now with the “new normal”?</p>

        <p>Cancer patients gets treatment if it's emergency, but for treatment to make them more comfortable when having the disease they may be a bit delayed. But there was an ALS patient who couldn't get a tracheotomy because of too many COVID19 delays in March. Norway.</p>

        <p>Ironically I could very much go the Reddit doomer route.</p>
<p>I love working from home. I wasn’t allowed to do so before this fiasco.</p>
<p>My job is very much secure.</p>
<p>I don’t actually mind wearing my neck gaiter in shops and transport. (I do however get very annoyed when I’m asked to wear it for 2 seconds from entering a bar to my table). I’m ironically more bothered by <em>others</em> wearing masks (it creeps me the fuck out, especially those horrid blue surgical ones... I get startled when I see a masked profile picture pop up on my feed. It’s innate to me) and the self-righteousness rivalling angry vegans of rabid pro-maskers. My limit is having to wear one outside, I will never do this.</p>
<p>I’m allowed to partake in my hobbies and sports - softball and baseball, along with the gym - all’s Lowe’s in the rules.</p>
<p>Can still go to pubs and restaurants, for now at least, but still have to deal with all the security theatre.</p>
<p>The only major thing missing is gay clubs. :’(</p>
<p>Yet, I object to all of this nonsense. The fearmongering, the oversanitation and bubble wrapping of the world. Seeing everyone as disgusting pathogen vectors. </p>
<p>As much as I don’t mind my gaiter, this being a permanent thing frightens me to no end, and some people seem to want this! Can you imagine the effects this has on not only adults but children? It makes time think... I wonder if countries who insist on covering some of all of their populations faces have resulted in major psychological effects on its population.</p>
<p>Who will open a business in this sort of environment? I worry that big businesses will reign even more supreme.</p>
<p>I don’t like how there is such a push for a virtual world - more like a virtual insanity. We are humans - social animals.</p>

        <p>I'm a mask skeptic. I became it recently. I learned during the pandemic time that masks affects my listening abilities. It's also affecting other's abilities for social interactions. When I can't understand what my teachers are trying to say, it really upsets me. Both mentally and emotionally.</p>
<p>To be honest, if you asked me a year ago if I believed face covering would be normal I would believe it was a 1st April joke. I knew face covering is common in countries like Japan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia etc., but it has never been a tradition in my country in modern time.</p>

        <p>My biggest issue is that we only talk about the perceived “benefits” of lockdown, while being shut down when we say what about XYZ. As others pointed out preventive care was nearly nonexistent for months. We’re at the point now hospitals along with all other business models except monopoly retailers is failing.</p>
<p>For me personally I’m deviated by the school closures.  I’ve been with my 3 kids non-stop since early March. I am exhausted. I don’t have any help, it’s just me. I’ve also maintained by stressful FT job, that is one of those big retailers grossly profiting currently. I had to drop out of college until life is more stable again which means my family will continue living just above poverty for longer. </p>
<p>That’s not even all of it. My 10 yr old is autistic. He was placed in a social emotional class in 1st grade. He’s worked so hard the last 3 years in that setting. Last school year he had maintained in general education so well that in March we all agreed to formally remove his IEP for special ed. Not even a week after signing the papers school closed. The regression i see everyday is breaking me. I removed my kids from public school as virtual learning just doesn’t work for us. The support he needs isn’t there right now and I just keep hoping if things ever do re-open he can bounce back. This is potentially derailing his entire education and adult life.</p>
