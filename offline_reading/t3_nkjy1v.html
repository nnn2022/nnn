    <strong>Hospitals are lying about covid + share your real moments when you realized this is all bs</strong>
    <p><p>Obviously there are many people who won't believe me, as I have no proof other than my word. I will respond to anyone who wants to debate in a respectful way, but I have no time for assholes. That being said, here's what I recently found out.     </p>
<p>As many people have probably been hearing since last year, hospitals have been under fire (in underground news) for allegedly falsifying covid records and exaggerating claims of how busy they were (nurses dancing on tiktok, anyone?)      </p>
<p>I don't know about you guys, but I haven't had the chance to personally discuss this on reddit with anyone, ie. only read articles or otherwise seen things that I wasn't able to engage with. So although I was generally of the mind that hospitals were lying, I would say I tried to keep a healthy level of skepticism until further proof became available or I could converse directly with those experiencing it.     </p>
<p>Well the other night, I ran into a friend I haven't chatted with in a while. I trust things he tells me, since his family is well connected in my town and he just tends to know what's going on locally. In the past, he has told me things that were going to be happening soon in town (that seemed wild and like exaggerations or lies) that later turned out to be 100% true. So I have no reason to think he would be lying about this.     </p>
<p>Basically, his mom, who he lives with, works at the local hospital, and has for decades. I'm not sure of her exact role, but she's definitely higher up in the chain of command and might be some kind of nurse. Well according to her, covid-19 isn't real.     </p>
<p>To be clear, the virus does exist. However, as we all know at this point... It's bullshit. It's not half as deadly as they say, and it's all just about control.     </p>
<p>She says the hospital hasn't at any point had a huge influx of patients like the news has been reporting. No triaging or overflowing ICU. In fact, they are in the middle of a handful of lawsuits from patients who were falsely reported on by the hospital (publicly?) to have covid. As in, they were there for unrelated reasons and the hospital just decided to label them as covid cases.    </p>
<p>I have no trouble believing this, as my hospital is well known for being fucking corrupt. If you get hurt, you'd have a better chance of survival going to the small town hospital an hour away than to ours (we're technically a small city).   <br>
My grandfather in law had a heart attack, and they made him sit on a bed in the hallway next to a biohazard trash bin on a cart filled with vomit and OPEN. For 14 hours. Then sent him home with no tests.   <br>
When my FIL went there for a heart attack, they sent him home without doing any tests. If he hadn't had a glass of wine after to thin his blood, the walk in clinic doctor said he would have died.   <br>
I know people with drug addictions who've ended up there, and they've had their drugs stolen by the nurses right before being abused and kicked out.   <br>
So yea, this hospital being corrupt is no shock to me.    </p>
<p>Anyway, I just felt the need to share this. To say I'm completely convinced covid is a sham now is an understatement.     </p>
<p>Please share your stories about what convinced you beyond reasonable doubt that covid is a scamdemic. Preferably ones that you didn't hear about on the internet, but things that you experienced in your real life/things local to you.     </p>
<p>Here's another one from me: I know literally nobody who's died or been hospitalized from covid (let alone even been sick), yet I know two people who've died from the shot. Yep, completely safe üôÑ</p></p>

        <p>I also don‚Äôt know a single person who has been hospitalized for covid and I don‚Äôt know anyone who knows anyone who has been hospitalized, but I know many people who know people who have died by suicide this year. That alone was a big red flag that lockdowns are harmful rather than helpful.</p>
<p>In February, my mental health and anxiety reached a point where I was experiencing significant chest pain and was told by a clinic to go to the emergency room to make sure my heart was in good health (it was, thanks lockdown anxiety). I spent around 4 hours in the emergency room with only 5 other people. In 2011ish, I went to the emergency room and was there for the entire day because it was so crowded. I get that the ICU is different from the emergency room, but I definitely expected the hospital to be much more active, when in reality it was unbelievably dead and it was during my province‚Äôs supposed ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù too.</p>

        <p>I had neck surgery at Sibley Hospital in DC last May 2020.  It took me 45 min to find the surgery center.  I walked that whole hospital and didn‚Äôt see one person anywhere.  I finally saw a nurse, asked where the surgery center was, and she didn‚Äôt say one word.  She just strolled by with a weird look.  There was no one there in the main hospital.  It was 5am but that shouldn‚Äôt matter.  I finally found the surgery center in the basement floor.  It was sooooooo eerie, that‚Äôs a popular hospital</p>

        <p>Right, you'd think everyone would have died by now if it was deadly. And don't get me started on these new variants Holy fuck. Everyone is so stupid.     </p>
<p>Like, I got a common cold when I was 7 and nearly died since I have asthma, and it ended up giving me bronchitis and pneumonia. I had tubes up my nose in the hospital for a week and was rekt. Sounds pretty similar to what covid does now. Everyone's always at risk if they have a lowered immune system (young) or preexisting condition (asthma), yet somehow life goes on despite the risks</p>

        <p>Exactly...they exploited rare effects of a mostly harmless virus. Profited off the fact that the public doesn't know that sometimes a virus that is harmless for 99.5% of people kills the other 0.5%. And people like me who get over things fast have not gotten anything probably was asymptomatic cause l haven't avoided the coof since this started.</p>

        <p>The whole asymptomatic things is the thing that gets me... Like if most people who get it are asymptomatic doesn't that mean most people have literally nothing to worry about?? They make it out to be so scary but doesn't that mean it's literally almost harmless? They think people are so stupid it's insulting.     </p>
<p>I thought I was getting sick possibly one day right around the time they started freaking out about India a few months ago. I popped an echinacea supplement and drank some vitamin D in my water, slept for a day, and woke up feeling great. No idea if it was covid, but as a healthy young person (even with mild asthma), I did the exact same thing I would do for any other cold and the results were the same. People staying inside watching Netflix and the news and shaking in fear are the ones who will get sick. It's no way to live and an absolute violation of our rights to expect that of everyone for so long</p>

        <p>I never really thought the virus was as bad as the media &amp; Democrats said. At the hospital I work at, the doctors &amp; nurses always had a ho-hum attitude about it until the administration forced us to wear masks. Any type of mask - which since we have yearly PPE training we all knew was a joke. But behind closed doors, masks off &amp; no social distancing. Closed 2 floors because of lack of patients &amp; are still closed. 
And when they started getting bonus money for CoVid patients &amp; deaths the data mining started - going back over patient records to see if someone may have had CoVid &amp; they could claim them &amp; get the extra money. For 6 months our state would see a one day jump in "reported" deaths every couple weeks - data mining would find deaths from months earlier &amp; be reported.
Employees have gotten 3 bonuses the last year - when the administration was asked where the money came from they would not say - just that we deserved it.? Also received 2 pay raises &amp; a few gift cards as a thank you.</p>

        <p>Wow that is very telling!! I'm thinking that's very similar to what happened here. Especially so since Canada has provincially funded healthcare, so the hospitals report directly to the Minister of health and don't have to jump through insurance companies first. Have you been threatened to keep quiet about it?</p>

        <p>I work at a hospital in NY but I'm not clinical.  In April/May of 2020 my co-worker (who has an office in the same suite as me and four other employees) tested positive for COVID.  She didn't have any symptoms except for loss of taste and smell and was only tested because her husband tested positive.  A woman from the NY DOH called her to let her know she tested positive so my co-worker asked her if she should quarantine.  The DOH told her that since she works in a hospital she is considered an essential worker and therefore has different directives. The DOH told her to follow the directive she receives from her employer.  So my co-worker notifies the appropriate people in the hospital and she was told that she did not have to quarantine.  Why????  Because she was asymptomatic.  She continued to come to work everyday and we were all exposed to this deadly and contagious virus yet, miraculously, no one else got sick.  The funny thing in all of this is that my co-worker who had covid was in charge of all food donations to the hospital and every day she was handling the food for the staff in the hospital.</p>

        <p>Wow! And wasn't NY supposedly one of the worst hit places? I remember seeing in the news something about tons of people dying and hospitals just in panic mode. That's insanity to me that they would order her to come to work if they were actually taking it seriously. Have you been told to keep quiet about things?</p>

        <p>Yep!  But that's not how it was at my hospital.  In fact, the president of the hospital said during a town hall meeting (he holds those every six weeks or so to keep the employees up on what's happening at the hospital) in the Fall of 2020 that "we didn't have more patients (during the surge), they were just more intense."  You would think that during a pandemic we would have more patients than usual.  After he said it, I looked around the room to see if that registered with anyone else in the room.  Nope.</p>
<p>And no, I was not told to keep quiet about things.  When it happened, I was sharing it with everyone I knew.  No one believed me and all I got back was the fluoride stare.</p>

        <p>Friend is an ER nurse in a big city. She had COVID once before vaccination and two times after vaccination.  At the ER the nurses and doctors often sit around joking with each other. One good one was two docs and 10 or so nurses all joking about COVID being a fancy flu and how they‚Äôve all had it even after vaccination.  Nurses not caring if you wear a mask or not though a few do. Talking to a doctor face to face with no masks on is pretty normal too.   They don‚Äôt even care about it.</p>

        <p>My moment was when we received my mother in laws death certificate last June after she died from advanced dementia and heart disease after a ten year battle. 
Those were listed as causes of death right under the line that said ‚ÄúCovid-related‚Äù. 
She tested negative and never had it. It‚Äôs utter bullshit and I was shocked.</p>
