<p>Why weren't these people having CD before they got vaxxed? </p>
<p>You know, it's one thing to deny that the vaxxes are causing the side-effects but it's another entirely different ballgame to BLAME the adverse effects on the person because of a psychiatric issue. This is the most insulting thing that I have encountered during the 18 month C19 saga and is the exact reason why people like me will die before getting vaxxed.</p>

        <p>Conversion disorder is usual a diagnosis once all other possible causes have been eliminated.  Anyone who would go to conversion disorder first is going against current medical understanding and guidelines, in other words, against science.</p>

        <p>Do you know what's the worst part of this? It's in the JAMA Network - supposedly the world's 3rd best medical journal (behind Lancet and BMJ).</p>
<p>Conversion Disorder is the absolute last diagnosis that you receive after exhausting spinal taps, MRIs, CT scans, video EEGs, anti-seizure medication, anti-depressants, etc. This is just the worst junk science that I have ever come across - blaming the vaxx-injured and literally calling them crazy!</p>

        <p>The amount of pressure I see to push this though is like nothing I have yet seen. I thought claims of this vax passport system being like a trial run for the mark of the beast was over played. But over the last few days I feel convicted that this is a bigger deal than I gave it credit for. </p>
<p>I tell people about the side effects that are officially published and it's like some kind of broken record where they just sideline what I said to repeat the vaccine is worth it. And some people are downright evil about the entire thing if you didn't get it. </p>
<p>At this point I feel like people want the government and the media to lie to them about the vaccines safety. I'm not kidding as I've heard a number of people tell me they shouldn't have ever reported the blood clots or heart inflammation. When God said people will want to believe a lie he wasn't kidding and that confused me for the longest time, but now I can see a taste of what that is like. </p>
<p>It's just gotten truly crazy.</p>

        <p>I've been saying this from early last year - this is demonic, is linked to the antichrist and the MOTB. I have never waivered in my conviction and even avowed atheists are starting to ask serious questions about this whole mess. </p>
<p>The most disappointing part of this whole ordeal has been the apathetic Christians.</p>

        <p>So what do you think Christians thinking of Romans 13:1-2 should do if becoming vaccinated becomes a blanket legal mandate?</p>
<p>I know many Christians would say since it's not the mark of the beast you should take it. I used to have that position as well, but giving in to this much fear mongering and injecting experimental treatment into your body is wrong to me.</p>

<p>No government laws trump the laws of God to NOT accept anything into our bodies that is related with socio-economic activities. I literally attended illegal underground churches for \~9 months because they were banned by the government. Christianity &rt; secular government.</p>

        <p>For starters, getting vaxxed doesn't prevent transmission and only serves to increase the probability of a person being an asymptomatic super spreader. The idea of "My vaxx prevents you from getting sick" is not tethered in reality.</p>
<p>Secondly, you can't convince a Christian who has chosen to "believe in science" instead of "believing in the Lord Jesus Christ." Their love of scientism will be their undoing unless they get back to the basics of actually believing what the Word of God says. After 19 months of warning Christians what this was all about, I am now focusing on reaching the unsaved-but-willing-to-listen crowd. </p>
<p>Thirdly, I would tell the Christian (sarcastically, of course) that it is selfish to let your fellow-Christians get persecuted because you refused to accept the government-mandated MOTB.</p>
