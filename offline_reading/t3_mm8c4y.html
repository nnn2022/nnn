        <p>I don't think the average Canadian even really understand what "civil rights" are. It's a shame that I have to share a border with Canada. It's sad, that they still think their government will save them. I think us "Yanks" will likely have to come to their rescue with vaccines. Most of you Canadians deserve the lock downs.</p>

        <p>I am a Canadian and unfortunately I agree with you.  Most Canadians don't understand what civil rights are.  You can literally get fined $10 000's for telling a joke that is offensive and most people seem fine with that.</p>

        <p>That has to be a fucking joke. If people are racist or whatever sure they're assholes and deserve to be publicly shamed but actually getting a monetary fine for saying offensive things? Something has to be seriously wrong up there</p>

        <p>Unfortunately it's true. There is a thing called the Human rights tribunal.  A comedian from Quebec got fined around $50 000 if I remember right for making a joke about a disabled boy.  The joke was in bad taste in my opinion and I don't condone the comedian for saying it, but it shows we have little free speech in Canada.  A magazine publisher got hauled in front of the Tribual for publishing the Mohammed cartoons and while he won his case it cost him a ton of money.  Even if you win you lose.</p>

        <p>He's such an hypocrite...He loves to cry in front of the camera and say sorry (as long as Trudeau father isn't involved of course) but he never does anything. Look at some Indigenous reserves,they don't even have a clean water system and he's trying to give us lesson about racism for wanting immigration to be regulated.</p>
<p>He's the racist one actually,he's always treating people of color like helpless idiots incapable of standing up for themselves. He only want the image of being the white knight. </p>
<p>Well we can't expect more from a theatre teacher. He's gonna give a few more checks to Canadians right  before the elections and all the idiots will revote for him.</p>

        <p>There's a guy in jail because he refused to call his like 14 year old daughter a boy while she's given hormones by a doctor without his consent, despite obvious mental health issues. At least that's how I remember the article stating it. The same bill that got jbp popular for being controversial is what enabled that. Trudeau and really our entire government has consistently fucked our ass dry. By extension this applies to everyone who voted him in. But to be fair our prime minister and thus essentially our senate are the choice of less than a  third of the voting population.</p>

<p>Ur right and I apologize for lumping all Canadians together. But the amount of laughing, jeering and "concern" I saw from most of your countrymen at how the U.S. was initially handling Covid was troubling. Browsing the Canada covid subreddits really showed me how arrogant and cowardly the majority of you folks are.</p>

        <p>Not everyone, you are here and I give you respect for going "against the norm."  IMO, Dr. Scott Atlas who Trump hired had the best idea about Covid. It was similar to a "herd immunity" approach but he was discredited because he was a President Trump appointee.</p>

        <p>Yeah, there was no way to erase all possibility of death or severe sickness from this, even if we were New Zealand. Some Canadians don't seem to understand that a small island is different than a huge country that shares a border with another huge country and relies on them for goods (and vice versa). Not that I'm blaming Americans for COVID coming in here, it could travel either way.</p>

        <p>I use to laugh at the comparisons when youngster said "this is our war" on twitter. But the truth is in war, there is death. It can't be avoided. I am just grateful that the Covid pandemic effected the elderly the most and not children. Because a 15yr olds life is worth a lot more than an 85yr olds.</p>

        <p>I don't like saying it, but it's true, since 85-year-olds have already had a full life to live. I don't like the idea of them being locked up in long-term care and retirement homes, though, especially since they may be living out their last years like that.</p>

        <p>YES, exactly!! They didn't even ask them if being locked up and kept 'safe' was what they wanted. I saw an interview with an older woman from a Toronto protest in front of Doug Ford's house, and she said that certainly wasn't what she wanted. I'm not sure how old she was, but she said she was a grandmother.</p>

        <p>I’ve come to realize a big part of the Canadian identity is largely being the not-US which I think is insecure as fuck but it’s true.</p>
<p>I’ve been on covid is bullshit since pretty much day 1 but early on there was definitely a lot of moral superiority from Canadians. I think since the vaccine rollout the superiority sentiment has changed, but I also think if the US ultimately rejects vaccine passports (hopefully!) I fully expect us as the non-US to roll that bullshit out. Hope I’m wrong there but wouldn’t be surprised at all.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately that's a popular Canadian sentiment. Canada has a major inferiority complex when it comes to the States, and Canadians love when the USA is having a hard time since it makes Canadians feel better about themselves. I'm not like that... I love the USA. You guys are the reason we're even able to have the quality of life we have here. I'm thankful you guys are Canada's biggest allies and I plan to move to the USA when i'm legally able to. But both of my parents are stereotypic USA hating inferiority complex Canadians so i've had first hand experience with that kind of condescending arrogance. The whole "Canadians are the nicest most polite people" thing is such bullshit. They're more "fake nice up front, but stab you in the back" kind of people from my experience growing up here.</p>
<p>Seeing my parents, and other Canadians, get all pissed at you guys killing the vaccination game has been very satisfying though.</p>

Reading some of the Canada subreddits, it seem like you folks are a nation of Karens. The way people are snitching on one another for defying Covid restrictions is very strange to me.

<p>Don't get me started. My mom was foaming at the mouth to call the cops to snitch when she saw a backyard gathering one of our neighbors were having... Despite also attending a gathering with people she likes not long ago. Hypocrisy is pretty much a malignant disease here. </p>

        <p>I can certainly force nothing on anyone.  I’m also not advocating martial law.  </p>
<p>My point is that it is common sense and basic human decency to be considerate of public safety.  No one can force someone to quarantine or get a vaccine.  The leading issue here is quarantining and vaccination are now view by some as a restriction of freedom and a violation of civil rights.  These are incorrect beliefs that only serve to wrongfully alienate those who are ready to be done with the pandemic (and are willing to contribute).</p>
<p>My points aren’t politically motivated.  A pandemic isn’t a time to decide whether or not one “will do what they’re told.”  Mandates should be followed because they are implemented to save lives and mitigate the spread of illness.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns, masks, and social distancing have been implemented, but not followed appropriately.  They are all inconvenient, but if we truly followed the advice of health professionals we would see more of an impact.  People have been protesting virus countermeasures since patient zero hit North America.  The national argument is “is this pandemic actually bad,” whereas it should be “how can we mitigate damage.”  There has been too much discussion and too little collective action.</p>

        <p>If masks, lockdowns and social distancing work, why are we where we are? Why is Covid still a thing?</p>
<p>I’ll give you an answer: because anything that requires 100% compliance is doomed to fail.</p>

        <p>“Anything that requires 100% compliance is doomed to fail” is an absolute that I don’t not accept.  Speed and BAC limits require 100% compliance for driving.  When not complied with, the risk of injury/fatality increase exponentially.  </p>
<p>We have multiple vaccines for COVID.  Unless there is a medical exception, I see no reason why, at the very least, that should not be required.</p>

        <p>Those things have an actual basis in reality and save lives, so people follow those rules willingly. </p>
<p>Masks, lockdowns and social distancing are theatre, and people see through the bullshit. Funny how people have to be beaten over the head and reminded constantly about how dangerous Covid is, and forced to follow the rules (that seem to arbitrarily change depending on the day) under threat of fines or arrest for non-compliance 🤔</p>

        <p>I know people that have died from COVID and COVID alone.  It was not a slow or comfortable death.  If wearing a mask is too inconvenient to potentially save a life, then there is an issue of morality.  </p>
<p>Again, there is almost no legitimate excuse to not seek out a vaccination.  Widespread vaccination will eliminate the need for these “theatrics.”  Pretending that there is a deep-date conspiracy run by Big Brother to control the minds and bodies of people does nothing except for increase loss of life.  It’s time to drop our egos and accept that the world does not revolve around doing whatever we please.</p>

        <p>I get a flu vaccine every year.  This isn’t a situation where wearing a mask means that we submit to having our way of life changed.  The point is to mitigate the spread of COVID.  COVID is new.  We do a lot for the flu.  Are we supposed to just give up whenever something new starts killing hundreds of thousands?</p>

        <p>Even if that were true, no one is becoming MORE willing to follow these rules so it’s basically pointless if it’s success requires everything go perfectly. Things like lockdowns aren’t supposed to be carried out on such a large scale, they simply can’t be controlled. It was doomed to fail from the beginning and at this point, the failure is blatantly obvious. </p>
<p>On the same note, collectivism like this is just so not feasible. You can’t lump entire SOCIETIES into this rigid little framework, individualism is still a thing despite the government actively trying to destroy it. Imagine how lame it would be if we were all the same and had the same beliefs and motivations. The government is pushing us towards that scary reality and the only reason I can think of is because it’s easier to control more people the more like-minded they are. Everything in this world comes down to greed, power and control.</p>

        <p>Your desire for infinite security and elimination of this disease is a wild goose chase that will never happen if the whole world cooperated. Even if we has eliminated covid. It would be "well now what about all these other diseases" and then as the slippery slope has been unilaterally proven to not actually be a fallacy, we would just eliminate death. Here's the thing tho. You will die some day, we all will. Nature is cruel, reality is harsh.  Covid is part of our life now. This doesn't mean there should be no efforts to fight it, just reasonable ones, that don't make the cure worse than the disease.</p>

        <p>Good thing that vaccine had lots of testing and we know what's gonna happen ten years from now and that we haven't been locked down and divided for 9ver a year of "15 days to flatten the curve" and "shutting down travel is racist" Nd "vaccine passports as just a crazy conspiracy theory" and way back at the beginning "masks don't help" followed by "mask mandatory" which is now followed by the CDC saying in March 2021 that masks don't do anything</p>
<p>Your definition of "empirically not worse" is such a narrow view that clearly your definition of worse is death onky. You're one of those people who only cares about life or death not quality of life. You'd keep someone alive and in extreme pain on life support who has terminal cancer just to delay their death and keep death numbers down because its "better"</p>

        <p>15 days to flatten the curve requires people to actually follow recommendations to work.</p>
<p>Shutting down travel is not racist.  It has been necessary and continues to be an important strategy to slow spread.</p>
<p>I’ve needed a list of vaccinations to travel to every country I’ve been to.  There’s a reason everyone doesn’t have polio in North America.</p>
<p>There is no credible threat to quality of life with the vaccines.  Outliers are to be expected with any medication, especially one that was approved only for emergency use (because we are in an emergency).  Ten years from now?  Do you suggest we let people die because of a hypothetical? </p>
<p>You mention keeping “death numbers down.”  I think you put that by mistake, as that’s used as an argument against those who don’t believe in the pandemic.</p>

        <p>When I found out about the virus in china in November of 2019 I said oh boy here we go</p>
<p>When the general pu lic found out about the virus in China people said restrict travel so it does get here which was met with resistance. Trudeau refused to limit travel until it was already in Canada. Trudeau urged us to not wear a mask for quite some time which people don't remember. Rent has continued to skyrocket and I refuse to take a drug that has less than a year of testing. Besides American health care is so good it would never sacrifice human lives to make money on a drug right? </p>
<p>IT'S not the vaccine itself, it's that we still have to wear masks, social distance and hope and pray daddy let's us live like normal again some day even after vaccination. Quality of life has way more factors than just whether you're sick with covid or not. The number of mom and pop stores the destruction of people's lives. All in the name of making YOU feel safe and insulated from other people's choice. It's about control or at least the feeling of control, of other people's affect on your life. Do you feel in control yet or will you keep going?</p>
<p>Remember to wear 3 masks (that don't protect the wearer) and dispose of them in the biohazard bins because theyre a pandemic driving biohazard.</p>
<p>Life is so precious its worth being miserable for your entire life just to be alive, depressed cause the world has taken your freedom? Must be a chemical imbalance and nothing to do with the conditions we ushered in. Surely the governments are only trying to keep us safe and have no ulterior motives because governments have NEVER done anything wrong in the name of "the good of its people"</p>
<p>I will not take the vaccine for now, as I'm not in the at risk catagory. The vaccines should be going to the age ranges that account for almost all the deaths. Why did we put covid patients in old folks homes anyway? Why did the cdc say widespread mask usage works but then later down the same article say masks reduced transmission 0.5% after 10 days and 1.8% after 100 days (that's 3 months) that sounds like a small as fuck number for the amount of money people have spent on masks and amount of trouble it's been giving out governments this much more power that they will to rally give up when its over</p>
<p>because government is known for realising it has too much power and giving it back.</p>

        <p>CDC data doesn’t change the virus.  The argument about the relevance of co-morbidity presence is not framed well.  If someone died because COVID was added to the mix of their health problems, whether or not it shortened their life by even a minute, then COVID caused their death.  </p>
<p>The accuracy of their data may not be 100%, but that does not mean the virus is safe or a hoax.  I should probably add that the Earth isn’t flat and 5G doesn’t cause cancer, but I’ll keep it to one thing at a time.</p>

<p>I can go on and on. Why don't people like you just live in a fucking padded room with no sharp corners for the rest of your sad lives and leave normal people alone? I've got scary news for you but...brace yourself now...you are going to die one day. You weren't immortal before the coof. I pity you tbh. My state didn't lockdown and I've been living my life pretty normally while watching people like you wiggle your arms around in a panic. </p>
<p>It's never going away my simple minded fren. Politicians and corporations have seen how easily controlled you are and they will fear monger until you say enough.</p>

<p>Why would you use a hypothetical for things you already know? The virus is deadly to a very small subsection of the population and perfectly safe for the vast majority. Pretty much anyone under 50 is going to be fine if they get the virus. The science is settled there.</p>
<p>I am willing to listen to science and live my life. I am not going to listen to one political appointee who has a very vested interest in keeping people scared as long as possible by omitting or lying about scientific facts.</p>

        <p>I support wearing masks and I believe in vaccines. Trudeau is doing a good job but he should make the quarantine mandatory.</p>

        <p>You realize fucking Serbia and Morocco (which are both much poorer than Canada) are ahead of Canada in terms vaccinations. So even if you agree with vaccines. How is Trudeau doing a good job?</p>

        <p>Serbian here, I know literally two people that have vaccinated. I really don't know where all these vaccinated people are supposedly coming from. Probably Belgrade, that city is fucked. Canada lite.</p>
<p>There's been talks of trying to make it mandatory here, so much for everyone wanting the vaccine.</p>

<p>This is where I got that from. It seems pretty accurate but it could be wrong.</p>

        <p>Oh I know all about the "stats" our fucking news won't shut the fuck about it.</p>
<p>Just saying from my anecdotal experience it seems completely the opposite.</p>
<p>Even if it's 100% true, you literally could have signed up since day 1 and been like "gimme". Anyone that wanted it has gotten it by now. And 2.something mil out of 7 isn't that much. Almost as if people don't want it.</p>
