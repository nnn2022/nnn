    <strong>There is too much overlap with "the new normal" and things conspiracy theorists have been warning about.</strong>
    <p><p>Face masks : loss of rights, loss of human identity, further move away from nature</p>
<p>Cashless Society: the virus is found on money, sorry only cards now. You will now be signed up for our centralized digital banking system were we will give you negative interest rates to encourage spending and stimulating the economy.</p>
<p>Contact Tracing: any remaining hope for privacy is gone</p>
<p>Warning Not an Anti Vaxxer but I definitely see if a vaccine is made people pushing for mandatory vaccines.</p></p>

        <p>It's confirmation bias, it's making a prophecy based on half-baked and misrepresented information, that nitpicks small details from primarily unrelated events to make a inaccurate narrative. </p>
<p>It's like the editing in reality shows, if you catch my meaning here. Face masks "take you away from nature", like what? What does that even mean?</p>

        <p>I get that, but I don't apologise. The reason this is confirmation bias is because he stated "I've always believed in conspiracy theories, and now I look at what is happening, and I can see that I was always right". So I gave the definition of confirmation bias, because his actions fit that definition. </p>
<p>In order for him to be right, he has to actually prove the conspiracy, right? Or at least get major evidence that helps build his case? Neither has happened. He does realize that face masks are used quite frequently by non-Americans? Asian cultures frequently wear masks, even when they are not under Asian authority. (I.e. when they live in America, Europe, Asia, etc.)</p>
<p>But now, he is just doing the same thing he has done in the past: take current events, and put them in the conspiratorial narrative. </p>
<p>"Face masks are designed to take away our identity", literally makes no sense. How would that even help anyone control a population? By making it harder for "officials" to recognize and track people? Its a big logical leap. </p>
<p>My overall point here: you can make anything sound like a conspiracy. Anything. That doesn't mean they don't exist, but it does mean you have to have the tools necessary to sieve out what is false and what could be true.</p>

        <p>Just curious, what about my comments led you to believe that I'm a man? I'm not and didn't think gender or sex was portrayed in my comments in anyway so I'm curious as to why you automatically assumed the person you're replying to is a man and not a woman.</p>
<p>My evidence is right in front of your eyes. Entire industries shut down overnight. Governors openly mocking and insulting those who oppose their policies. Schools being encouraged to close. A rich trust fund kid who can't form coherent sentences being elected as president. The government can <strong>and will</strong>do whatever they want, whenever they want, and not give a flying fuck about any consequences. "Do as you're told or else"</p>

        <p>I was going to write "they" as a non-gendered pronoun, but hadn't thought of it until halfway through, and laziness won the day. As a man, my natural inclination is to place "he", and I do apologise for mis-gendering you. That's not cool.</p>
<p>That "evidence" is placed inside the context of a global pandemic. I work in the Biomedical industry, specifically for research, and the pushback against masking wearing, for instance, is incredibly insane. Masks work, and they do not affect your health when wearing them to the grocery store or to work.</p>

<p>Masks are benign, they aren't even heavily regulated by the FDA, because they have barely any risk associated with them. They literally can't hurt you</p>
<p>Edit: I'm going to put a disclaimer, that if you shove it in your mouth and block your airway, it can hurt you, yes.</p>

        <p>Confirmation bias isn't making a prediction and then being correct 😂. Confirmation bias is having pre-existing beliefs, and selectively believing facts and narratives that align with those beliefs while ignoring input that disproves them. If you were to make a confirmation bias argument, you'd have to show that they're warping the input they've received into a false reality. Which I think you were trying to do. But the way it sounded was they said "I said all these things would happen and they did" and your argument sounded like "because you thought they were going to happen and they did, you saying you were right about them is invalid because your biases were confirmed" 😂. Which is just like saying "if you were right, then what you say is invalid".</p>

        <p>That's not what I'm saying. My point is that they still didn't happen, literally the OP of this post has just theorized why we have to wear masks/why this pandemic is happening. There is no evidence here, no data, no admission of guilt, no uncovering of a secret plot. There's nothing here, and then you've got people on the comments going "I'm prone to conspiratorial beliefs, and I look at this information, and I believe that it confirms what I've always feared" </p>
<p>They are taking small details, and <em>because of their pre-existing bias</em>, they are saying that those details prove what they have always thought. </p>
<p>Have any of you actually lost any family members or friends here? To this disease? I have, and I gotta say, I don't believe this is a big ole conspiracy.</p>

        <p>I have lost friends and family members.  These policies affected their mental health to the point of suicide. Some had delayed medical procedures that have a good chance of causing serious harm in the long run. </p>
<p>The virus itself is not the "conspiracy." I'm not denying the virus. Yes people have died from it. The "conspiracy" (in quotes because it's not a conspiracy if it's actually true) is government response to the virus.</p>
<p>The issue is more complicated that "the virus is everything" vs. "the virus doesn't exist".</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, but I believe there is a way to effectively deal with this virus, and it is going to be uncomfortable. We need the resources available to make sure people are mentally and physically supported during this time, but those same people have to be aware that wearing masks and social distancing are the only things that are proven to work with this virus. We have to make sacrifices, and undermining our community's ability to handle this virus is not helping.</p>

        <p>Bit of conspiracy-ception for you. The term "conspiracy theorist" was likely purposefully coined to discredit anyone that calls out people in power. Now you don't have to actually argue the points someone makes when they question powerful and influential people. Just call them a "crazy conspiracy theorist" and move on.</p>
<p>Remember when the government spying on all your phone calls was a "crazy conspiracy theory" until Snowden?</p>

        <p>Have you heard of Dr Kaufman? He presents a good argument about how vaccines have not actually been proven effective. He has an interview on London Reel I would recommend. I don’t know if I agree with him or not, but I prefer to have both arguments presented instead of how the one sided news/education system presents it. </p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that the pro-vaxx movement was manufactured online. A few shills who went out loud and proud to social media and stirred it up into a frenzy a year ago in preparation of the vaxx we are currently “waiting for”.</p>

        <p>There are exactly zero studies on the health effects of the entire vaccine schedule  </p>
<p>I dont think there is even one vaccine on the CDC schedule that has been tested against a true placebo such as saline. All are tested against “fakecebos” that have all the adjuvants in them. So if 5 kids in the “control” group during the month-long trial get vaccine injury, the company can say that their vaccine doesnt cause any increased harm.  </p>
<p>I would say they havent been proven safe either</p>

<p>Just want to add that anti vax doesn't always mean that they're against *all* vaccines. Some people just question the efficacy of the vaccine itself. </p>
<p>And no one can convince me that a vaccine that has been manufactured in months (as opposed to years) is 100% safe. It's not. </p>

        <p>This. Conspiracy theorists are just guys ahead of their time. 
Edit: and to be fair, there is some out-there crazy stuff mixed in with the conspiracies. Half the time, it's interested parties making crazy shit up: Say you have a dark secret. Where better to hide it than in a widely marketed 'documentary' salted with weird shit about psychic vampires or something? Then every time someone find real info, everyone else will laugh and point to the nutty stuff.</p>
<p>The other half the time...well, it does take a paranoid and slightly unstable person to dig for dirt like that. These are guy with bullshit detectors that are waaaay sensitive, so sometimes they come up with insane stuff along with the real stuff they find.</p>
<p>Take pizza gate. Are there powerful pedophiles in the US government? Well, if they were found in the UK government and the Catholic church, and Hollywood,  why not?? An entirely reasonable thing to believe. But add 'oh and it is all done out of this particular pizza joint and they harvest infant blood for devil worshiping rejuvenation rituals', and it becomes laughable and people dismiss the reasonable part.</p>

        <p>I was listening to the Corbett Report the other day and he was talking about levels of propaganda. He was talking about a book on Snowden written by an establishment journalist, and the journalist talks about how this lunatic conspiracy theorist had been warning about NSA spying 10 years earlier, and he had ignored it. I mean, HELLO! Maybe that lunatic was actually onto something, if he had uncovered something 10 whole years before you? Food for thought...</p>

        <p>If you're diving into places like that for the first time, be sure to familiarize yourself with concepts like controlled opposition, COINTELPRO, limited hangouts and the like. If there's truth to any of this stuff, the perpetrators have a vested interest in misdirecting anyone who comes looking for answers.</p>
<p>One helpful principle that hasn't let me down yet: keep a look out for someone attempting to <em>shame or ridicule</em> you into believing something. If they're resorting to peer pressure, chances are reality doesn't back up what they're saying, and they're hoping to scare you off before you realize that. As we've seen with the "selfish grandma killer" rhetoric.</p>

        <p>That story has been switched up so many times. They redacted the statement that smear transmission could be possible up to 14 days of Corona nonporous surface  lifespan.  </p>
<p>This was initially supported with bogus studies. Then they they redacted, to say that this is NOT the case. I'm thinking, well of course this isn't the case, CV has a similarlmities to other lipid based viral structure such as the flu and they KNEW this already.  </p>
<p>They KNEW that the CV could be disinfected and spread in identical ways as the Flu because of the structure of the virus, and they still went ahead and used the [it's a novel virus] angle to attach unconfirmed, outlandish and alarmist behavior to the virus through reviewed studies and media bits, exploiting the fact that many of us never heard of the coronavirus.  </p>
<p>Again the agencies' and the media's deliberate attempt to attach unconfirmed, outlandish and alarmist behavior to the virus, while exploiting the fact that some of us have never heard if the coronavirus, is fear based MARKETING. </p>
<p>They intentionally positioned "COVID-19" with an invisible, hard to kill, lung destroyer with long term damage into the mind of the public. </p>
<p>Once this is done, it will take millions of dollars of efforts to reverse this effect. You cant change a first impression once it's made.</p>

        <p>There is a lot of truth in what you say, but I would say the masks are a recent panic-driven response rather than constituting part of a conspiracy, at least not part of a conspiracy to eradicate privacy; consider that for decades facial coverings, most prominently burkas, were systematically targeted for suppression in a variety of countries for "security" reasons, due to it being far more difficult to identity and track people when you can't see their face. Facial recognition surveillance systems are a pillar of this vision of eradicating privacy, and as late as last winter were closer than ever to being widely adopted, even if they weren't remotely effective yet. Now in the space of a few months all those decades of effort and development have been completely repudiated by mask mania followed by mask mandates. Unless the decades of build-up was some sort of deception in an even larger overarching plan to destroy privacy, logic suggests that this is a genuine panic-driven mania.</p>

        <p>That is the main reason I think that face masks aren't going to stick around.  A lot of money has been put into the development of that software.   I was in a local essential store awhile ago, and walked into a cosmetic aisle and there were two teenage s girls acting funny as I came around the corner.  I am fairly  sure were shoplifting.   They had serious masks up to their eyes and sunglasses.</p>

        <p>Why would they need facial recognition when they have an app installed on everyone's phone that tracks not just where you are, but exactly who you've been in contact with and for how long, plus works across borders with a standardised API (GACT) across the only two operating systems that 99.9% of consumers consider as an option to use.  Couple that with the abolition of cash so that every transaction can be fully traced, and you have a virtually impossible to escape global surveillance web that is a totalitarian dictators wet dream.  They don't need facial recognition, it's become pointless, unreliable and far too easy to circumvent (you've shown that - just wear a mask!), so put that down as a failed experiment.  I guess before this they didn't realise how easy it would be to get people to happily accept 24/7 global surveillance that they install themselves.  If you want to see it in action, take a look at China where you need to scan your phone to enter certain businesses and if your code is 'red', for whatever reason the algorithm decides, you can't come in until the system decides you are 'green' - no way to complain, no way to find out why, just suck it up and deal with it and hope the system decides you are a good citizen again.  China has been the test playground of the corporate elites for decades and they now want to implement exactly the systems they have tested there on a global basis.</p>
<p>Yes, I know the argument against this is contact tracing is 'voluntary', but if you think that it will stay voluntary, I've got a bridge to sell you.  They will just make it more and more difficult to do things without it until you need to have it anyway (exactly like they will do with a 'voluntary' vaccine), or eventually do away with the app and just bake it directly into iOS / Android, since the API is already baked in anyway.  You won't be able to fly or travel, or enter certain businesses, without having contact tracing enabled on a phone, would be my guess - so yea, 'voluntary'.  If we are thinking we can circumvent it by keeping the phone off or not carrying one until we need it, maybe the system decides if it can't tell what you've been doing for the last x amount of time, you are a 'health risk' and therefore get a red code and are banned from doing certain activities until you have x amount of history again.  </p>
<p>They are already subpoenaing people for contact details in Washington and implementing huge fines for people who don't respond, does not sound voluntary to me, and this is just the start.  The noose will tighten further over the next couple of decades as encroaching authoritarian technocracy with absolute control over its citizens is established across the globe, and the really clever thing is that people will cheer for it and beg for more as it will all be done in the name of health and safety.  If people start to question it, just invent another viral scare and get your media propaganda mouthpieces to spread fear throughout the entire population until they will accept what ever measures you want.</p>

        <p>I’ve been a follower of them for a long time, because the conspiracy theory folks are ahead of the curve. Yes you need to weed through flat earthers and the queen is a lizard stuff, but as long as you have your thinking cap on, you can see they make more sense than official reports. I would highly recommend looking into some of the other theories and their defences of those theories, may help with your understanding of the world today. </p>
<p>Remember, if the person is discreddited, you don’t have to defend against their argument and that’s what triggers have been facing for a long ass time.</p>

        <p>I consider myself a super rational person. I'm a skeptic toward all kinds of things, not just covid-related. So I'm not normally prone to buying conspiracy theories without doing a ton of research.</p>
<p>I believe that there are basically 3 types of "conspiracy theories". </p>
<p>The first type is like the National Enquirerer Bigfoot type. They're fun but they don't have any basis in reality. </p>
<p>The second type are the ones that have a basis in truth, but are surrounded by a bunch of fringe followers who tarnish their credibility by associating kooky ideas with them. A good example of this is the pizzagate thing. </p>
<p>The third kind are the ones that are actually true and have evidence, but either people discredit them because they don't want to believe it could happen or there is an agenda to discredit people who talk about them. Like the fact that government and intelligence agencies have actually experimented on our own citizens.</p>
<p>I think that we're somewhere between 2 and 3 right now.</p>

        <p>If there really were a conspiracy to condition us into submission through mandatory masking, why would the American CDC flip on masks after months of telling people they’re useless? I know Fauci basically admitted to lying about mask effectiveness, so it’s very possible the government could be misleading us elsewhere. And why would states start and stop re-opening multiple times, frustrating and confusing people rather than keeping them locked up? You could say it’s part of the conditioning — prepare for lockdown at any time — but the reversals make me less likely to take the orders seriously. </p>
<p>People are losing rights because of misplaced priorities, individual bad leaders and coronavirus tunnel vision among the public. Sometimes I feel like it’s harder to accept that the people who can ruin our futures with an executive order are just incompetent and arbitrary humans, not masterminds controlled by a higher agenda.</p>

        <p>I was with you for a while, thinking the people in charge are just idiots, but IMO too many supposed stupid decisions have happened for it to just be stupidity.  Faulty test kits. People dying of other causes, but covid is being put on the death certificate, people getting their cancer tests, cancer treatments and other medical treatments delayed still here in the UK. In freaking July. And no one in charge can figure out that delaying it for months will cause thousands of deaths?</p>

        <p>Perhaps Fauci didn't get the message and needed to be 'educated' on the correct message?  If not, what reason do you actually suggest he flipped on the messaging - because there isn't a good explanation for why he did so anyway, the science didn't change about mask usage, it's just as useless in the general public as it was when they were telling people not to mask.  So what changed?  And why did it change everywhere, at the same time?  </p>
<p>Organising a global conspiracy is a messy business, luckily when you've got a bunch of docile sheep to manage, it doesn't matter if you aren't consistent, in fact maybe it's even better to give them a bunch of mixed messages so that they have no idea what information they are being given is actually true and most people just give up and accept what they are being told.</p>
