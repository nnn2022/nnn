        <p>Okay, what background information justifies 2.8 million deaths over a period of about 16 months? And furthermore, what background information justifies the cavalier attitude you people have towards this pandemic?</p>

<p>How is a covid death labeled a covid death</p>
<p>How many of these 2.8 million were young healthy people in the prime of their lives with no underlying conditions</p>
<p>What do you want us to do about it.  What are we doing wrong?  Put up one about heart disease and I'll start railing on people to stop visiting KFC.  </p>
<p>Serious should we lock down harder?  Is it the people wearing masks under their nose across the globe that are keeping it going?</p>

        <p>You understand the burden of proof is on you right? You can’t just be skeptical of numbers from the CDC while giving no justification for your skepticism.</p>
<p>But I’ll answer your questions</p>
<p>How is a covid death labeled a covid death?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-covid-19-deaths-are-counted1/">Scientific American</a>, the physician that deals directly with the patient - “Death certificates can be signed by a physician who was responsible for a patient who died in a hospital, which accounts for many COVID-19 deaths. They can also be signed by medical examiners or coroners, who are independent officials who work for individual counties or cities. Many COVID-19 death certificates are being handled by physicians unless the death occurred outside of the hospital, in which case a medical examiner or coroner would step in, said Dr. Sally Aiken, the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME). In some jurisdictions, including cities such as Chicago and Milwaukee, medical examiners are involved in determining the cause of death for every suspected COVID-19 case. In those jurisdictions, medical examiners review medical records even of patients who die in hospitals to ensure that the symptoms and any testing indicate that the patient did indeed die of COVID-19.” </p>
<p>How many of these 2.8 million were young healthy people in the prime of their lives with no underlying conditions?</p>
<p>It is obviously true that those who have died from COVID-19 are overwhelmingly <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/78-of-covid-19-patients-hospitalized-in-the-us-overweight-or-obese-cdc-finds.html">overweight </a> - I would like to point out, most people in counties like Canada, the United States, Australia and the UK are overweight to some extent - and older. But at the <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbs19.tv/amp/article/news/health/coronavirus/verify-comparing-total-deaths-from-2020-to-2019-and-2018/501-355b857c-e7e9-40e4-b31d-11500cbcb103">end of 2020</a>, in the United States anyway, we still had more deaths than we had at the end of 2019 and 2018, you can’t act like those deaths would’ve happened anyway, the numbers aren’t on your side. </p>
<p>What do I want us to do?</p>
<p>Take this disease seriously, really seriously. Speaking from my own experience as an American, we have been chronically plagued with constantly wanting to go back to normal, wanting to open schools up again, wanting to open the economy up again, and not giving proper consideration to the risks of that. In my state, we’ve gone back in forth between phases a number of times. </p>
<p>We should’ve locked down and guaranteed masks to everyone in January or February of last year, that’s when scientists were telling us this had the potential to be a pandemic. But we didn’t do that, we denied the reality of the situation - not unlike you people are doing here - and the disease spread exponentially like all diseases do. At this juncture, I think we should be ensuring swift vaccinations while responsibly locking down and guaranteeing and enforcing masks being worn - combined with proper stimulus.</p>

<p>I guess it's incumbent on overweight people to get healthy then, and not lock a whole population down which comes with its own host of health repercussions especially a year later.  It would have made more sense to only lockdown the in the beginning to get a handle on things and then allow natural immunity to develop and circulate among the population.</p>
<p>I take the disease with a 99% survival rate about as seriously as I do the flu.  </p>
<p>I guess Fauci fucked up then, didn't he.  Saying that asymptomatic transmission is never the driver of diseases in Jan last year then in March saying it was subsequently unnecessary for healthy people to wear masks.  Only thing is no study has really come out since then to refute that and the whole 180 he made claiming he said what he said to save PPE for medical staff is horseshit.  </p>
<p>New Zealand's hospitals are overwhelmed right now.  Their isolationist approach will continue to bite them in the ass when their Winter hits and as soon as they open their borders their population will be inundated with people carrying variants for which they have no immunity.</p>

        <p>Cool soc. May enjoy this excerpt (heavy AU in here): 
https://www.asio.gov.au/publications/speeches-and-statements/director-generals-annual-threat-assessment-2021.html</p>
<p>"Today’s ideological extremist is more likely to be motivated by a social or economic grievance than national socialism. More often than not, they are young, well-educated, articulate, and middle class—and not easily identified.</p>
<p>The average age of these investigative subjects is 25, and I’m particularly concerned by the number of 15 and 16 year olds who are being radicalised. They are overwhelmingly male.</p>
<p>Investigations into ideological extremists have occurred in all Australian states and territories. Compared with other forms of extremism, it is more widely dispersed across the country, including in regional and rural areas.</p>
<p>The extremists are security conscious and adapt their security posture to avoid attention. In their online forums and chat rooms, they show that they’re savvy when it comes to operating at the limits of what is legal and discuss ways to ‘beat the system’ in what they say and do.</p>
<p>ASIO anticipates that the threat from this form of extremism will not diminish anytime soon— and may well grow.</p>
<p>The online environment is a force multiplier for extremism; fertile ground for sharing ideology and spreading propaganda.</p>
<p>Ideological extremists are now more reactive to world events, such as COVID, the Black Lives Matter movement and the recent American Presidential election.</p>
<p>COVID has reinforced extremist beliefs and narratives about societal collapse and a race war. As a consequence, we are seeing extremists seeking to acquire weapons for self-defence, as well as stockpiling ammunition and provisions."</p>

        <p>Sorry, can't say I get the jargon, but thanks for the excrept! Sounds like some interesting job offers too - no actual skills, just "lateral thinking". A bit of a dissonance really, I thought lateral thinking was banned in favor of correct, straight as a straight white man thinking.</p>
