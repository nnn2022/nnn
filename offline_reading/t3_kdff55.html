        <p>No, they won't. They will go after the rest of us to get vaccinated too. The narrative is already being written. Check out some of the recent articles that say we will need to continue wearing masks and social distance after the vaccine, that we need to protect the unvaccinated, that normal won't come back because of those who don't vaccinate, and so on.</p>

        <p>Sorry but in the list of essential workers someone in a restaurant is not essential.  There is still food on the shelves, don't have to get food from a restaurant.  How about law enforcement, workers that maintain water treatment plants, power plants, and so on.  Those are essential, Karen serving you another pint or some greasy burgers is not.</p>

        <p>This hits home so hard, in a somewhat different way.</p>
<p>A friend of mine almost died from a simple bacterial infection because of all hospitals he went to ignored his actual symptoms, and apparently were only interested in knowing if he had COVID-19.</p>
<p>The first time he went to the hospital, he had fever, which meant that he was forced to take a PCR test just to be able to even see a doctor, and wait HOURS for the result.</p>
<p>After the result came back negative, a doctor saw him for 1 minute and gave him some anti-vertigo medication.</p>
<p>He started to get way worse, with his hands swelling, fingers with pus, and many other swelling and redness all over his body.</p>
<p>Went to the hospital once again, and was told it was "nothing" somehow, and just got some anti-inflammatory meds.</p>
<p>Then the fever got way worse, hitting over 38 degrees Celsius for most part of the day, went to 3 different hospitals, the first time to an emergency room at night after his fever got really bad, and after being scolded for going to the hospital with a fever without before calling the hospital so that they could "make arrangements for it", he was put in a ridiculous plastic bubble where a social distanced doctor, with full protection heard his symptoms, and then claimed his situation wasn't an emergency and as such he should just go back home.</p>
<p>The second time, he went to see an internal medicine doctor, and because now the place with the most swelling was bellow his ear, he was told to go to see an otorhinolaryngologist.</p>
<p>The otorhinolaryngologist then said that it "might" be a bacterial infection, for the first time, but never did an actual blood test or anything to know what type of bacterial infection it was, and just send him home with 3 days worth of some random antibiotic.</p>
<p>Then, about 3 days ago, he got really really bad. The swelling from bellow his ear now expanded to half of his face, his fever was of almost 39 degrees Celsius, and now wasn't even able to eat, since just putting things on his mouth hurt.</p>
<p>He didn't wanted to go to any other hospital anymore because he felt he was going to be ignored once again, but I just called an ambulance because I knew his situation was really bad.</p>
<p>I went with him to the hospital on an ambulance, and it was infuriating listening how the people in the ambulance seemed to care more if he had covid, was exposed to covid, or if he went "anywhere with a lot of people", than the fact that he was on the brink of having a septic shock.</p>
<p>People at the ambulance called multiple hospitals, and most of them just outright denied him, since he had a fever, and now people with just a fever are put in a different "prepared" limited number of rooms, and most hospitals were just "out of them", basically almost blaming him for having a fever.</p>
<p>In the end we were sent to some very big emergency hospital, and people in the ambulance told us that since in this unprecedented times, this was a equivalent to a "warzone" (literal words), he wouldn't probably get a full diagnosis for the time being, and would just get something to get down his fever and pain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, probably because once again, he was on the verge of having a full blown septic shock, he for the first time got a full diagnosis. Full blood test, X-rays, CT-scans, and it became pretty obvious that what he had was a cellulitis infection gone wrong after not getting any appropriate treatment for more than a month.</p>
<p>But even in this full diagnosis, he apparently was asked many times by the same doctor of COVID related symptoms.</p>
<p>In the end he was given intravenous antibiotics, and now is in a 2 week treatment.</p>
<p>If the treatment doesn't work, which could be the case, since he got before a 3 days worth of some other antibiotic medication, and the bacteria could already generated resistance to antibiotic medication, he would need to get hospitalized.</p>
<p>So, in his case, his Corona-virus symptoms are, pre septic shock bacterial infection.</p>

        <p>I dont know where you live but as a Paramedic reading this I want to apologize for the medics treatment. Unfortunately, where I work we are given a list of questions to ask anyone presenting with signs and symptoms of covid-19 and if they don't need emergency treatment (eg. they cannot breathe) we are basically supposed to do a telamedicine call and have them stay home. We work under the license of our medical director so we have to follow whatever protocol they issue for us. We don't even bring cardiac arrests to the hospital anymore unless we get pulses back. It's a very unfortunate circumstance for everyone and that is an understatement. So many people are dying as a result of this virus that have nothing to do with the virus because their care is being mismanaged. I'm happy your friend finally got a proper diagnosis. Prayers for a healthy recovery.</p>

        <p>I've gone to see one since this started. He was wearing both the mask and the face shield. Another incredible precaution was that they banned even one person from waiting in the large waiting room, opting instead to make everyone wait in the hallway instead. It's a public building and since this doctor's office is closer to the middle of the hallway than the end, there was traffic from people going to the offices further down the hallway.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to get exemption, but he refused saying he wouldn't give an exemption to anyone for any reason. But seeing how public places are treating people with medical exemption, I don't think it would make a difference anyway.</p>
