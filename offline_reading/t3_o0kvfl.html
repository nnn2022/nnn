    <strong>The “conspiracy theory” is always sold along with the lie</strong>
    <p><p>So with all this talk of lab leaks and email leaks I want to talk about a concept I think is getting overlooked quite a bit.</p>
<p>Whenever a psyop takes place it is imperative to bury the truth. So what this means is the “mainstream” narratives can not contain the key points that will lead people to the truth. There is a long list of events that have happened that I think demonstrate this.</p>
<p>Covid: first thing they did was change the name of this phenomenon early on. What started as Coronavirus(which is a catch all term for many normal flu variants that we deal with every year) was branded as Covid. Also if you have been following from the beginning you will know that the “lab leak” theory was dropped at the very beginning. This was not the result of independent journalism. This is done on purpose for a few reasons. 1 to muddy the waters. 2. To get the population to fight amongst themselves and take a side. And all this is done to take your attention away from the truth. It’s a magicians trick as old as time. It’s the Kansas City shuffle for any of you that have watched Slevin. The whole point is to have you not see that this “virus” has always been around and it’s normal and nothing to be afraid of. Anything that says otherwise will be pushed heavily in the mainstream media AND the alternative media.</p>
<p>9/11: this psyop works in much the same way. Every conspiracy theory under the sun was dropped along side the mainstream narrative. Everything from Thermite to Judy Woods “dustifying” bullshit to nuclear/energy weapons. All meant to divide the people and have them not realize that what they watched that morning was a made for TV movie. Anything to sell you on the fact that the US was attacked in some way when they simply just demolished the buildings.</p>
<p>Pizzagate: another psyop to take the attention away from real child trafficking. This was pulled off in a similar way. The “leaked email” approach. It gives the appearance of information we are not supposed to have so it ropes in the people who don’t trust the mainstream media. </p>
<p>Notice they will always give us a “fall guy” or scapegoats. Epstein, Bush, Maxwell, Assange, and now Fauci. This gives the appearance that these are isolated incidents to distract from the larger narrative. </p>
<p>At the end of the day these a psychological operations. They are designed to mess with your mind and to make sure you fall into one narrative or the other. To divide and obscure truths. As a people we have to stop falling in these traps. We are dealing with masters of human psychology and until we all understand that and realize that we are going to be fooled and are all susceptible to this we are going to keep falling into the same patterns. I know it’s hard not to lash out at the sheep who just don’t see it but that is also furthering the division and playing right into their hands.</p></p>

        <p>Edward Bernays already told us, back in the 1920s, how he and his kind were setting the scene and writing the dialog for "democracy".  It was considered "modern" and "scientific", a better way to govern than the surging masses of plebians casting their votes in their own self interest.  Sure, the party bosses had filtered out most reforms for the previous 100 years, but that still left two battling parties, and they didn't <em>always</em> work 100% in favor of the moneyed class.  How much more <em>civilized</em> to get the citizens to believe the same things, repeat the same narratives, and scorn those who believed in archaic notions of rights and freedoms.  Sure, they retained the left-right/black-white/rural-cosmopolitan false divides and offered up all the talking points to further all sides of those arguments.  It is critical for people to feel involved and believe they are making their own choices.</p>
<p>Now consider that they've had 100 years to perfect their art...</p>

        <p>I saw this happen last year with the BLM riots.</p>
<p>All sorts of celebrities were posting these goodwill BS stories of "we are in this together" and around late May, early June I was seeing more and more posts of people on the internet blasting these celebrities who were posting from their yachts and their megamansions on 20 acre plots with giant pools, tennis and basketball courts. These people were in paradise telling people in their one bedroom apartment that it was tough for everyone. Rumors began spreading of lockdown mobs getting ready to form.</p>
<p>I was thinking "holy shit is this it? Are the mobs finally going to start attacking these wealthy bastards? Are people going to revolt against authority and tell them we aren't going to take it?"</p>
<p>And then the media gave those mobs a target. "Forget this whole class thing, folks! Race is your real enemy!" And the BLM riots started on que. It was a briliant bit of diversion that probably saved a few state capitols from being burned down by angry people locked in their homes.</p>

        <p>Thanks for writing this. The number of people in here who are arguing both that covid is not a deadly virus and simultaneously that it is a bioweapon that escaped a Chinese lab shows that cognitive dissonance is not limited to the branch covidians.</p>

        <p>Exactly, and I find it very funny that so many people believe they were right all along just because the MSM is now picking up the story, the same people they don’t trust. Cognitive dissidence indeed</p>
