    <strong>Outsider here. Just wondering how you formed this opinion.</strong>
    <p><p>I took a GCSE in sociology a few years ago, and I remain interested in the subject. I’m currently reading about and researching the societal implications of this virus, and the accompanying lockdown. Just for fun, as I find it interesting.</p>
<p>I am pro-mask myself, but I want to understand your point of view too. What led you to believe that masks, lockdown, etc. are the wrong path to take?</p></p>

        <p>The moment they said “new normal” and “wait for a vaccine” alarms started to ring in my head. Then the fact that there weren’t bodies on the streets and how many already had the virus and had the antibodies I knew it wasn’t that bad.  </p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong I don’t thinking’s a fake virus. It’s real I know people who had it.  My aunt passed away from it but not to sound insensitive she was 78 smoked, obese (maybe diabetic not too sure) and had a major stroke in February she was just unhealthy her whole adult life   We had one family friend had it very bad and he’s lucky to be alive. On the ventilator for almost 2 weeks and woke up on Easter, a complete miracle.  He hasn’t recovered fully yet as crazy as it sounds but he’s much better than when he first came home and is improving day by day.  He’s diabetic with heart problems and obese But even he’s like “yea the worlds gotta move on”     I just feel like we’re screwing over the healthy people which is like 99% of the population lmao   Plus seeing Australia turn into a police state is nuts. I don’t think it’ll happen to other countries and I think it’s turning the corner but it’s a slippery slope. 2 weeks to slow the spread turned into all this.</p>

        <p>Please see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ip5fu0/scientific_evidence_and_crosscountry_variability/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">extensive compilation of the research on masks.</a></p>
<p>There isn’t a “view” here. There is evidence. The overwhelming weight of evidence shows that masks are not proven to be effective at all.</p>
<p>Evidence that masks don’t work:</p>
<ul>
<li>decades of studies, and reviews of studies, on the use of masks in operating rooms and by ordinary people in daily life: the overwhelming consensus is that, at absolute best, there is no evidence that masks are effective (and some studies demonstrated higher infection rates with masks compared to no masks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence that masks do work: </p>
<ul>
<li>a few tiny, very weak studies in 2020 in a lab setting that basically showed that masks can stop particles from passing through in a controlled setting. Nothing that counteracts the mountain of evidence that masks don’t do anything in practice</li>
</ul>
<p>I just wrote a few comments on this that you can see in my history if you want, not rewriting it. </p>
<p>Until a few months ago, it was long and openly acknowledged that masks are not supported by evidence despite many attempts to get evidence, and their use was hotly contested. </p>
<p>This “masks work” consensus is fabricated bullshit that works solely because it really super duper feels like masks SHOULD work. </p>
<p>There is no “view” here. No “opinion.” There is evidence. Try actually looking at it.</p>

        <p>I don’t mind masks/people being encouraged to minimize excursions. I personally don’t like/believe in mandates. Give guidance and let people make decisions. If a store wants to Ban anyone not in a mask, that’s fine with me. I don’t want the government requiring people to do things. There may be more excuses in the future for the government to take emergency powers and I don’t think we should be handing them out like candy for a virus. </p>
<p>After this experience, i worry that the various governments around the world are gonna be much quicker to subordinate norms and people are too cowed to stand up. It’s a slippery slope.</p>
<p>To add - they keep moving goalposts and now the new thing is that a vaccine won’t end this. The lack of clarity and deliberate goalpost moving is making me less inclined to believe in the people responsible for making covid policy.</p>

        <p>My beef is with lockdowns and global restrictions more than masks. I consider them psychologically and spiritually destructive and a flagrant violation of human rights. Sweden has proven that it’s possible to manage the spread of Covid without resorting to police-state tactics.</p>

        <p>You're not going to understand my line of thinking.  See, I have all the same info as you and am looking at the same numbers.  I just don't think the numbers are a big deal and you do.  I don't think this response is worth saving the number of people that "scientists" (in quotes because I've never met someone whose job is "scientist") say it will save.  We can't understand each other because we have a fundamental disagreement as to what's important.  And neither of us can convince the other because "what's important" is a matter of opinion.</p>

        <p>And that castrated mindset is why we are losing. You cannot remotely fight, let alone win, this kind of battle without a concrete sense of right from wrong.</p>
<p>The Draconian measures and fearful attitudes in response to this is completely, wholly wrong, without question. We have the evidence, the truth backing us up.</p>

        <p>I think you mistake what I mean.  I do have a concrete sense of right and wrong, and I'm sure it largely aligns with yours.  I'm just saying we're fighting a futile battle until we acknowledge these things.  Think of it from the other direction.  They're fighting exactly the same way.  They think that if they shove the truth down your throat enough, you will either swallow it or choke on it.  Have you seen any progress from us shoving the truth down each other's throats?</p>

        <p>you should ask yourself the same question first, how did you form your opinion? why do you think the response we've seen is normal, good or effective? why are we overlooking the catastrophic consequences?</p>
<p>no one thought it made sense to wear a mask to protect against viral transmission before, there are already decades of studies on that subject, which have not been rendered invalid by the recent propaganda. lockdown, social distancing and all the rest of it was never the solution before now either.</p>
<p>at this point the only way anyone can still be in favor of the measures which have destroyed millions of lives and threatens to permanently alter the world as we know it, is if you simply have no grasp on what actually has transpired, or you are benefiting in some way from it.</p>

        <p>If interested, I'd be happy to discuss. The biggest issue I continue seeing is studies discussing clinical use in medical environments, vs untrained masses without proper information, materials, or training.</p>
<p>In addition, there is decades worth of verified studies showing delayed/harmed mental development of children and adolescents when they were kept from seeing facial expressions through masks. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are increased incidences of bacterial bronchitis from incorrect mask use. There is little to no evidence of it working in practice- in most cities in the US, cases either continued on it's previous trajectory, or else increased. (It got to the point where they were using misleading graphs to make it look like it was working. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/kansas-democrats-covid-chart-masks-the-truth-11598483406)</p>
<p>if you can provide a study used of masks being useful in a non clinical environment, I would love to see it. I can provide links and sources to back up all my claims if you're interested in continuing the discussion.</p>

        <p>Early on, after my initial alarm over the possibility of a serious pandemic, I noticed the manipulations in the media, especially the aversion to talking about denominators.  The narrative felt very shaped.  Keep in mind that I have doctoral level training in epidemiology and work in the computational biology / bioinformatics space, so I do know how to assess quantitative biological data from multiple sources.  The pro-lockdown narrative is very anti-science (in the true meaning of the word, i.e. based on falsifiable hypotheses evaluated by multiple data sources) and it feels very clearly coordinated from a high level.  Then I asked, who benefits from the lockdowns?  The answer isn't pretty.</p>

        <p>1) I don't trust my government for shit, especially when it's grabbing tyrannical emergency powers left and right. (Also went out to protest police murdering people, sorry if that doesn't fit in with your stereotypes)</p>
<p>2) As a young healthy person not living with anyone elderly, I am not at high risk for covid19 death; in fact, I'm exactly the kind of person who should be out and about socializing according to herd immunity theory. As a single person not living with anyone I'm close to, I AM at high risk for suicide if I'm forced to #stayhome for an extended period of time. Being constantly vilified on the internet doesn't help either.</p>

        <p>I majored in economics and I am fascinated with human decision making.  I follow the money and try to understand who intends to benefit from situations with an analytical approach.  I seek out independent journalism and really find that some of what they say makes a lot more sense than what our governments and MSM do.  James Corbett of the Corbett Report being one prime example. </p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that COVID is at best, an opportunistic power play by big pharma, tech companies, governments and NGOs to implement biosecurity and tracing measures that will cripple individual citizen sovereignty while also waging war on an independent middle class, essentially transferring a majority of their wealth to corporations and the already ultra wealthy.  </p>
<p>At worst, it’s a full on psyop plandemic, with the same essential outcome.  </p>
<p>I wear a mask out of courtesy and a desire to avoid confrontation with random strangers.   I do not believe that I or my family is in worse danger from the illness than we are from the encroachment upon our civil liberties that is coming fast, and will make these mask mandates look like seatbelt laws by comparison.</p>

        <p>right??? wtf??? people used to make jokes all the time about "thinning the herd!" and that "we need a new plague!" schtick from the Office, and now suddenly we're the ones KILLING GRANDMA.</p>
<p>they don't like it, but social Darwinism and survival of the fittest and - GASP -  natural selection are still very real, very tangible, very consequential things. evolution didn't go away because 'rona entered the chat. </p>
<p>we're evolving now in real time, which is actually a very cool way to look at this weird gross mass psychological experiment. nature is healing! our brains are adapting and evolving in real time! (i just thought there'd be more recreational drugs during the revolution, tbh. v disappointing, lol.)</p>
<p>human beings are social creatures by design - it's how we've evolved and succeeded. these doomer people are also probably very uncomfortable thinking about apes and chimps and gorillas as our cousins - because that means we're ultimately just animals too. simple base primitive creatures.</p>
