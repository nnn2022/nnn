    <strong>Anybody else getting a 'The Faculty' vibe lately or Invasion of the Body Snatchers?</strong>
    <p><p>I have been getting a creepy vibe lately as if the gene therapy may be some alien race trying to take over the planet. And the reason the pro vax who don't die are so eager to get others to get it is because they are now being controlled by an alien organism ala the movies mentioned in the title of this post. Anybody else getting those vibes? I know it is totally insane to think this at all... but is it really any crazier than Bill Gates farming potatoes for McDonalds and McDonalds administering vaccines and Heinekin ads and President threatening door to door visits... after all... we all know the virus is exceedingly survivable! So is it about depopulation? Or maybe replacement by some 'other'? This thought has been lingering in the back of my mind... moreso in the form of everybody is being swayed into a global satanic cult... but after just reading a young man's account of his friends spending their night out egging him on about getting the vax and how he needs to and why is he waiting etc. etc. I just had the other thought become slightly more crystalized. Feel free to call me crazy. I don't much care. We all know something strange is going on... how strange is the only thing we have yet to discover.</p></p>

        <p>They are, but it's through the screens -- not the vaccine itself.</p>
<p>In that regard, it is more likely that subconsciously they know they did something that was completely insane and the best way to feel better about that is to get everyone to do it, too.</p>

        <p>I saw a guy talking about how the vaxx is for an "alien take over" on the conspiracy reddit board.</p>
<p>One part of my ultra bible prophecy/conspiracy studies of the past, was studying the Nephilim, I once wrote on that weird old blog, "aliens are demons" [archons etc] Think that one out....demons seem to want it in people really bad. Aliens or demons. There's "stars" warned of in the bible. Star of Rephan, a few others, it's late..... :/ Yeah my thoughts have gone weird plaes on this.....</p>

        <p>Quick book recommendation for ya: 'Final Events' by Nick Redfern. About a government thinktank who came to the conclusion that the alien ufo phenomena is demonic in its origin. Also sort of timely with the soft disclosure type stuff we see like the navy videos etc.</p>

        <p>I kinda have because the cleaning guy would come in once a week and IMMEDIATELY start talking about cases. Then he would come in and it was cases and vaccines. Then it was just vaccines and he would ask people if they were getting it. Then he would ask if they got it. Then one day he actually got it and wouldn't STFU about it. </p>
<p>But then one day he stepped through the door and literally yelled VACCINES!!!!! And it was the weirdest shit I ever experienced. And he kept asking people every week, but finally my company let him go because we no longer need the covid deep cleaning. </p>
<p>My other experiences with vaccinated people haven't been much better. I go to pick up food and hear people talking about their vaccinations.  My friends roll their eyes at the government overreach in 2020 and then in 2021 they are posting masked up vax selfies and making fun of "antivaxxers". The rest of them are posting the same tired joke about getting wifi or growing a tail TWICE--one for each dose they get. I got rid of them all. I can't deal with it any longer.</p>
