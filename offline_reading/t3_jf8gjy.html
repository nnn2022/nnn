    <strong>Just had our first church choir practice since March.</strong>
    <p><p>Rural NSW, Australia. Our town may have had a handful of cases early on, but we haven't had a peep of the virus since then. Nevertheless, our church, like everybody's, was effectively closed by the government lockdown.</p>
<p>Almost like nothing happened, we're back. Although, notwithstanding the 47 person limit, only 5 people can sing at a time. We just rotate the singing amongst ourselves so everybody gets a go.</p>
<p>I believe now that the whole conspiratorial angle I took towards the pandemic from the start, the emotions, the passions, the angerâ€¦ all it was was my having a hangup about not being able to sing in church anymore. And the fear of never being able to do it again. </p>
<p>So, I don't care now, Agendas 21/30 can go ahead as planned, Bill Gates can inject all the CoV-I.D. 2020 vaccines in me he wants. Just as long as I get to sing about Jesus in church with a choir of human beings.</p></p>
