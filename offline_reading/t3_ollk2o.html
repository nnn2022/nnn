        <p>You might want to do some research into other vaccines and how they effect our health.</p>
<p>There is not much different between the Covid-19 vaccines and other vaccines besides these have less safety testing.</p>
<p>There is no data to suggest any vaccine actually caused the decline of said disease as ALL of the diseases we vaccinate against had already declined around 80-90% even before we started vaccinating everyone against them.</p>
<p>You also might want to try and find actual replicated experiments that support the idea that viruses even cause disease.</p>
<p>If you find any let me know, cause I have not found much evidence.</p>

        <p>&rt;besides these have less safety testing.</p>
<p>That was my point, considerably less testing. For me that's the key difference.</p>
<p>Everything else you said I profoundly disagree with. Vaccines have literally saved entire populations over the years. Many millions of people. I'm not here to debate that as it's absolutely concrete.</p>

        <p>Here is a good paper to read to understand how you have been misled.</p>
<p>"In general, medical measures (both chemotherapeutic andpro- phylactic) appear to have contributed little to the overall decline in mortality in the United States since about 1900-having in many instances been introduced several decades after a  marked decline had already set in and having no detectable influence in most instances. More specifically, with reference to thosefive conditions (influenza, pneumonia, diphtheria, whooping cough, andpoliomye- litis) for which the decline in mortality appears substantial after the point of intervention-and on the unlikely assumption that all of this decline is attributable to the intervention-it is estimated that at most 3.5 percent of the total decline in mortality since 1900 could be ascribed to medical measures introduced for the diseases considered here."</p>
<p>The Questionable Contribution of Medical Measures to the Decline of Mortality inthe United States in the Twentieth CenturyJohn B. McKinlay; Sonja M. McKinlayThe Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. Health and Society, Vol. 55, No. 3. (Summer, 1977), pp.405-428.</p>

        <p>During these though times I feel more alone than ever. One moment I'm in a subreddit with a bad statistic and in the other there's a based meme. I don't know anymore, I don't know what I belong to. Maybe I don't belong anywhere. Maybe I'm a lone wolf destined to eat the grass before his feet. Maybe I don't need a pack to make me belong. Maybe I don't need to belong. Maybe I'll find my own grass on my own small part of land next to the highway, where the cars drive by. Maybe I'll sleep and shit there too. Maybe I'd rather start eating my own shit on a dry meadow without grass than go to one of those big grasslands. Because after all, I'm not a cow.</p>
