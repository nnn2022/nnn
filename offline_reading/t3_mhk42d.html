    <strong>Little things that scare you about covid?</strong>
    <p><p>I seen a thread on nextfuckinglevel earlier where someone posted a picture of needle and said how it was there greatest day as a nurse giving out 150 vaccines. Its scary a well educated person thinks like that. Surely they've saved a life before or helped an ill child or something? Even if this vaccinen is a miracle cure (its not) physically saving someone's life or bringing a smile back to a sick child's face would be a normal rational person's "best day as a nurse ever"</p>
<p>In the comments people were celebrating this person and then parts got sidetracked where people were announcing their excitement for their vaccine day. Being excited for any injection is weird, being excited for a rushed, experimental vaccine is very weird.</p>
<p>Other topics that occurred was comparing what vaccine they got like kids announcing their Christmas presents</p>
<p>"I got pfizer"
"Awww man you're so lucky i only got moderna"</p>
<p>I find this very scary how people are acting about this. Regardless of what is the truth about covid. This behaviour is unnatural and ridiculous. What little things have you noticed that scares you about all of this?</p></p>

        <p>I don’t know but the person I’m thinking of is really into the new age/metaphysical community. I know a lot of people from that group because I’m kind of on the fringes of it myself but I’m actually surprised and disgusted at how authoritarian these liberals have become. A lot of people have changed for the worse sense the pandemic happened. But I also see a lot of people like me who have gone to sort of a left leaning libertarian mindset.</p>

        <p>How quickly the media was able to get a large segment of the population to flip from hating Big Pharma to lining up to give it a tongue-bath.</p>
<p>I'm a little embarrassed to admit I used to be one of their (partial) defenders. Critical of unnecessary price hiking and patent abuse, but I blamed the FDA for a lot of it. This whole ordeal has made me realize that pharma's detractors were more right than I thought, though the truth is still kind of in between. R&amp;D is still really expensive. And right when I'm figuring that out, all of a sudden <em>they've</em> reversed position are practically worshipping the pharma companies. WTF?</p>

        <p>Things that scare me about covid? Literally nothing. I get more frightened when I will be 5 minutes late to work.</p>
<p>What scares me is the fact that I'm surrounded, flooded, engulfed by a population of drooling morons with an IQ far below room temperature that hasn't caught on to the fact their compliance is what has allowed for us to get to this point to begin with. We are living in absolute clown world, and the only thing i can do anymore to keep from losing my sanity is laugh at it all. </p>
<p>The SAME PLACE this virus originated from is the SAME place these cuck muzzles are made in. If you take a look at the bottom or side of the box, it specifically says it's not to prevent the spread of any virus, and more specifically covid. The fact that this means fuck all to anyone at all is when I realized we're never returning to the normal we once had.</p>
