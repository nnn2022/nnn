    <p><p>Vaccine or no vaccine, it doesn't really matter we're all waisting our time choosing sides like it's a new religion and for what? We've let the media manipulate us, divide us, and turned each other into domestic terrorists (in our own minds obviously). Why aren't we asking real questions regardless of whether we need to get vaccinated in the first place, everyone who wanted it for protection has got it,  everyone else wants to chance it, that should be fine given the stats and the official guidelines regardless of your side of the argument. If you're vaccinated brilliant you're doing something for your society, you are helping towards a good cause.</p>
<p>If you don't want it that should be your choice, given the vaccines are supposed to work (not in the traditional sense) but you guys can transmit according to the data anyway, its not us, its that the vaccines don't work that great and your immunity is shit for a while while you're bodies are adjusting. </p>
<p>Please don't make people that don't want it feel like traitors to their country because they don't want to take an experimental vaccine, we just want to see what the long term effects are before we shove it in our bodies (ahemThalidomide to name but a ver few), sometimes scientists get things wrong. That should be respected in our culture. We respect people who believe all sorts of bollocks in our societies so please just let us see what happens for a couple of years.  </p>
