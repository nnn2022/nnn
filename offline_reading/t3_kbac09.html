        <p>Put all the money aside for a minute.  They're telling us, if you even half look, that these vaccines are untested, have side effects, and are possibly dangerous.</p>
<p>The only thing besides money I can think of is to establish dominance.  Just like the lock downs, restrictions, curfews, and all of it. There could be tracking or other things in it too, but again that's to establish dominance. These people are seriously messed up control freak totalitarians who really don't care about humanity, in fact I believe they hate it. They care about power and control over the proles and all of Earth's resources. They want to break the will of the west.  If that doesn't work, they'll just wipe us all out and bring in a more subservient population.</p>
<p>We're to take the vaccine and shut up about it because they believe own us.</p>

<p>because fuck you, that's why.</p>
<p>obey and do what you are told, it's for '<em>their</em> greater good' </p>
<p>it's slavery, straight up slavery.</p>
<p>'voluntary servitude' is still servitude and perfectly 'constitutional'</p>
<p>the slave populations are being 'upgraded' from slavery 2.0 to slavery 3.0</p>

        <p>Look up WEF amongst other topics. The endgame is way past "more money". It's a totalitarian society, where you are controlled down to the smallest thought.</p>

        <p>In my mind, the front-running theory is ignorance and the cult of smug.</p>
<p>Nobody in a position of power can seemingly ever admit they were wrong. About anything.</p>
<p>And ignorance does not equal stupidity. Not by a long shot.</p>

        <p>I figure it's because they're politicians who depend on the people to become elected. One of the worst things for any politician is to be seen like they aren't doing anything. They obviously want to keep power and keep the cash to their bank accounts flowing.</p>
<p>So by implementing mask mandates, placing restrictions on businesses, and locking down entire cities/states, it makes them look like they're doing something - even if the result isn't a desirable one. So when it doesn't work to stop the spread (because really nothing will, short of the world locking down and everyone properly wearing higher level masks all the time), they can all say "Hey guys, sorry, we tried." while virtue signalling and pointing the finger elsewhere - likely onto the citizens they claim to protect.</p>
<p>Just look at how the media and people as a whole attack politicians such as Kristi Noem or Ron DeSantis. Those two have done what they thought was necessary to help prevent the spread, without going full-on authoritarian mode. As a result, they've been relentlessly attacked and smeared by much of the population.</p>
<p>I'm also sure that fear of not going with the group plays a part as well. Some locked down, got praised, more followed suit. Soon enough, even if some politicians didn't really want to follow suit, I guarantee they were pressured into it, and likely also didn't want to be "that guy" that's left all alone by not shutting everything down.</p>

        <p>I work in pharmaceuticals and some of these medications literally cost $20,000 per month and most of the patients need multiple other $20,000 per month drugs. Same patients are taking up to 20 other drugs for other reasons. Same patients have 20 drug allergies. I heard a consult the other day where the pharmacist was saying the patient was on a drug for both constipation AND diarrhea. So they take a drug for one symptom and take other drugs for the side effects of that drug and so on and so forth. Making us sick is a very lucrative business.</p>
