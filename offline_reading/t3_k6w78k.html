    <strong>I Feel Ideologies Have Become The New Religions Going Forward...</strong>
    <p><p>Libertarians and new conservatives together, welfare state supporters together, SJW together, etc...</p>
<p>From relationships to investment opportunities, who you surround yourself with going forward will be dictated by ideological principles, people you want to work with or employ, all seems to come down to ideologies. Whether you believe in production, more freedom, less taxes, less government, less thought control or bigger governments, more hand outs, less production, less growth, carbon fuels are evil, we must save the earth even tho it's a lie...</p>
<p>I know it all leads to collapse, it's not sustainable at all even in the very short term. This anti growth anti human ideology that seems to have infected many on the far left... Can you imagine what the west coast in the US looks like in just a few years? </p>
<p>I think Libertarians and new conservatives will be an ideology liked by many more people post collapse within the next few years, it'll be the only real way out of the global slump we will be in... Promoting growth and freedom, innovation instead of identity politics and thought control by the eugenics.</p></p>

        <p>The elites have clearly chosen SJW/environmentalism as the one world religion  and they are using technology and violence to enforce and eliminate all opposition. I hope you're right but it's not looking good at the moment.</p>

        <p>I can't see how this goes on for more then a years... The basic instinct of every living thing on this planet is a survival. </p>
<p>Same thing could of been said in every fascist nation up until their point of crumble... Asia isn't a good example because Asians will tolerate extremely bad conditions, enslavement and even death before fighting back. What's currently happening in China is a bad indicator for other countries, because the population is completely different, the mindset of freedom is completely different.</p>
<p>In advanced economies, including Japan which is clearly more conservative then far left, people value economic freedom and personal freedom too much to let insanity rule forever... At some point, there's enough adults that say, this is enough it's too disturbing, society has crumbled to the point of degeneration, fuck the eugenics and change course.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just too optimistic, who knows...</p>

        <p>I agree on most of your points. </p>
<p>As far as warfare is concerned, however...</p>
<p><a href="https://rense.com/general96/china-bio-weapons.php">China</a> is a <a href="https://rense.com/general96/china-bio-weapons.php">ruthless </a> enemy. </p>
<p>They‚Äôve declared war on us...</p>
<p>If we‚Äôre on lockdown....and the Chinese invade...imagine how that would turn out. </p>
<p>I mean this is really serious stuff. I can‚Äôt even go to work and not be concerned that I don‚Äôt have a firearm yet. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs in Biden‚Äôs dreams to ban assault rifles...and good luck getting access to weapons after he‚Äôs in. Oh you need ammo too? Too bad American. </p>
<p>A fully prepared America, where most of us are on board ideologically, is a scary fucking thing. I‚Äôd be totally down to kick some Chinese ass. And not let the fucking shadow people get away. </p>
<p>And the thing is, if the exposure gets out enough about what the fuck is happening, just that will happen - an explosion in American pride. We do what we want with this country, not them. Let‚Äôs not forget that. </p>
<p>Of course, if not, the latter will happen - America will be destroyed, and under complete Chinese supervision.</p>
<p>Obviously to a large extent - that‚Äôs already happening! What do you think Tik-Tok is? The most advanced (surely with AI) surveillance system known to man. Directed at our country. </p>
<p>‚ÄòConspiracy theorist‚Äô. Uhh, I think not.</p>

        <p>One thing is certain - an exponential increase in violence, or an exponential increase in innovation. One is going to happen regardless, the other is up to history to decide.</p>

        <p>I think both happen... First the collapse, then violence, then innovation. No growth or negative growth environments has historically showed violent results.</p>
<p>At one point, it gets too deranged and collapses, according to history... It will be no different this time, the eugenics won the battle but lost the war in 2020 I feel. Yes they control the politicians in advanced economies, but the fact their ideology is so disturbing, is why society as a whole will never accept it.</p>
<p>I think the violence and collapse will be much shorter then previously demonstrated through out history... This thing won't last decades like the USSR, it'll be a few more years in my opinion.</p>
