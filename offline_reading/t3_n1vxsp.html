        <p>I am no expert and can't judge everything that was said by those people, did only watch the 1st hour of this video so did only listen to Dr. Mercola.</p>
<p>I think things are not black and white I don't expect that if I find a onesided view or a half truth that he must be automatically wrong in everything else they say, so I just talk about the facts he mentioned that I thought and looked up something about:</p>
<ol>
<li>he mentioned Linoeic Acid is so harmful for people to have harder cases of Corona and other illnesses. I can't judge this statement, but he also said that the problem would be vegetable oils because those have high amounts of linoleic acid. Now maybe it's time restrictions but the people that have longest lives are italians and one reason that it's blamed on is the heavy usage of olive oil, which to be more precise would be a fruit oil, but the same is true for sunflower which is the oil he probably refers when he says it's in processed food. That said olive oil has around 10% of this acid and sunflower 65% and butter or coconut 2-3% that said coconut can be considered a fruit, too. So he is here at least not precise, which again can happen if you don't have unlimited time.</li>
<li>he says that in normal times socialism he means socialist healthcare because canada is surely not a pure socialist country except you use a definition that would also include america as socialism, when all mixed systems would be considered socialist. But he says that that kills people because they get later their MRAs. Which is at best a half truth and right wing talking point, now he claims he doesn't fall for a political side on this, but still he repeats a right wing half truth talking point. Why because as he himself arguments in this talk treatment and diagnoses can damage people, yes even diagnoses for dangerous sicknesses can cause psychological dramas so more treatment does not always result in better outcome, but more important it's not like that the capitalistic american system produces better outcomes for all people only those who are willing or can pay for the expensive treatment, forget about the people without healthcare but even those pay in the US gigantic co payments... if they don't feel that they soon die many people in the US delay or refuse to take such healthcare messages because they don't want a bill of 20.000-50.000 Dollar. or let it be only 1000-5000 dollar. Of course they will not do MRAs just to be sure... So he basically makes the assumption that everybody in the capitalist country is a millionare then maybe the outcome of this system is better, fine. But otherwise not. Also one factor of capitalistic system is that the doctors get paid extremely well that incentivises the best doctors of other countries to come to this country where they can be rich, so yes for rich people such a capitalistic system is better, but not everybody is rich.</li>
