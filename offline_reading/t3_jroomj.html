    <strong>Lockdowns punish the population for the failures and incompetence of government</strong>
    <p><p>Here we are facing the second round of lockdowns even though <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/11/09/does-lockdown-prevent-covid-deaths/">lockdowns do not work</a>.</p>
<p>Let's face the truth: The policy responses from modern governments are simply ineffective and unproductive against epidemics. But it is far worse than that: National health systems across the western world have been generally gutted in recent decades by successive central administrations. In doing so, governments have hollowed out their capacity to respond effectively to epidemics. So what we are witnessing now with covid is a predictable, self-imposed failure of central bureaucracies to deal with epidemics.</p>
<p>So how do we interpret the ongoing covid response in this context? <strong>Lockdowns (and mask mandates, etc) tacitly shift the blame and responsibility for governments' failures onto the population. In effect, lockdowns punish the public for governmental incompetence.</strong></p>
<p>This fact could not be more obvious than with the ongoing spate of second lockdowns. We were told that the first lockdown was meant to buy time so as to allow governments to build health-care capacity and prepare for a "second wave." Instead, government after government twiddled their thumbs during the summer and threw vast sums of money and resources after high-tech test-and-trace boondoggles, all the while doing nothing about health-care capacity. Lo and behold, the "second wave" is here and health-care capacity is no better than it was back in March. No epidemic response plans were prepared or implemented over the summer. And so, now that the governments' failed policies inevitably became too obvious to hide, once more politicians took zero responsibility for it and instead severely punished the population by plunging it back into forced lockdown.</p>
<p><strong>In sum, with covid, the general public has become the ultimate scapegoat for political ineptitude and unscrupulousness.</strong></p></p>

        <p>&rt; Lockdowns punish the population for <em>the failures and incompetence of government</em></p>
<p>what if i told you that the opposite is the case.</p>
<p>far from being a failure' or 'incompetent', they have been wildly successful at locking down everything and all the rest of it.</p>
<p>these masks, lock downs, etc were the goal, not an adverse side effect</p>
<p>&rt; In sum, with covid, the general public has become the ultimate scapegoat for political ineptitude and unscrupulousness.</p>
<p>heh, ultimate scapegoat = victim blaming</p>
<p>political ineptitude? no, the opposite</p>
<p>unscrupulous? yes</p>
<p>stop believing that the state's paid agents and minions give any fucks about you or anyone else's 'health' or 'safety' as there is NO evidence to support that belief</p>
<p>their goal is domination, power and control and they are succeeding wildly</p>

        <p>This could have been avoided if we refused entry from China back when rumours and news started coming in.</p>
<p>China should also be held accountable for lying and causing this mess.</p>

        <p>That’s an interesting point of view and has some merit to it. I’m gonna noodle that for a bit. Thanks for sharing.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I'm just trying to provide a different perspective and get a discussion going. I would love to hear other people's views and reactions to this.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna push back a little on this. All the resources in the world wouldn't have made the pandemic disappear. As soon as there was confirmed asymptomatic spread, it was over. The only way for governments to do anything was to completely destroy the liberties we take for granted, like forcing the infected to wear ankle bracelets and put them under house-arrest. Things you clearly can't do in any self-respecting Western republic.</p>

        <p>I’m studying mass incarceration right now in one of my class and we can’t stop talking about the lockdowns and how it’s pretty much the same thing and like op said, it shifts the blame on society. Without any governmental accountability.</p>
