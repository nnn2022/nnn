    <strong>When have protests against government restrictions EVER been looked upon negatively from a historical perspective?</strong>
    <p><p>The sheer amount of absolute vitriol being spewed at those who exercise their constitutional and human rights to protest lockdowns and mask mandates is absolutely staggering. I've seen comments online saying that these protesters should die, that they shouldn't receive any medical care if they get sick, and that they are the reason that the "pandemic" is still going on. (Would love to see "The Science" on that dubious claim). </p>
<p>While many anti-government protests have been controversial in their time (civil rights protests, gay rights protests, Vietnam War, Gulf War, etc) I can't think of any that have been viewed negatively from a historical perspective. Hell, even the incredibly violent French Revolution largely gets a pass in the history books, with Marie Antoinette continuing to be mocked more than 200 years later. </p>
<p>The only possible exception that I can think of to this is segregationists who were protesting laws that prohibited private businesses from discriminating based on race. However, those individuals ALSO wanted the government to compel segregation in schools and private businesses at the same time. So I'm going to call that one a wash. </p>
<p>Can anyone give an example of when protests against increased government laws haven't looked like the OBVIOUSLY right course of action through the lens of decades after?</p></p>

        <p>I can't answer because I can't think of any other time.  When before in history has such a strong media/social media presence been in place with the expressed intention of eradicating dissent?  I can't think of a time, not in the west. The propaganda is that those who do not follow are putting you and your loved ones at risk for death.  I think that's unprecedented.</p>

        <p>The government can't do this alone. They need the media, big business, all working together to push this out. What the government's can't do, the private companies can do. Vaccines may not be mandatory. But if you want to go to work, go to a restaurant, travel on a plane, train, or bus, or order from Amazon, you need to prove you have your vaccine.</p>

        <p>I'm sure that's the case.  I just won't do it.  Many others think the same.  Maybe once we all starve to death they'll attribute the death count to COVID.</p>

        <p>History repeats itself and people never notice until 50 years later. Don't worry, just know that your grandchildren will look back and atleast thank you for trying.</p>
