    <strong>Standing up for myself in the workplace</strong>
    <p><p>Id like to tell a story about what has happened to myself this past week and to inspire others to stand up for themselves and to treat others with respect.</p>
<p>First id like to say this advice isnt for everyone. Im unionized, and have no children or mortgage, for some people this isnt an option.</p>
<p>Okay story time, kinda long.
At my work place like others we have been physically distancing and wearing masks like everyone else. And while i dont like wearing a mask i tolerate it and understand. Luckily i dont deal with the public and we have been lucky to only have a few infections in a workplace of over 100.</p>
<p>My story starts earlier this week when a coworker told me we would be getting proximity trackers that will beep and record whenever we get closer then 6ft. I thought this was a joke and started laughing. He wasnt joking. Later that day it was confirmed by a supervisor. </p>
<p>I argued against this with my supervisor, and it got very heated and emotional. He started saying i should quit and called me a covid denier, which i am not. He asked we why i was even wearing a mask, to which i preceded to dramaticly throw my mask on the ground and announce i would be sitting outside from now on then.
Looking back this was wrong i shouldve gone to HR or a manager with my concerns. Not challenge my supervisor in front of others.</p>
<p>Later that day im called in to talk to the manager. We had a very respectful talk for half an hour about my issues. I told him how i feel that this tracker will create even more of a culture of fear and anxiety at work, my privacy concerns, how this will affect our work and i also mentioned i dont wanna be forced to take a covid test becuase someone who got sick happens to pass by me in the hall. I also talked about how we could change the culture at work to one more positive. Lately people have been arguing at work about politics and lockdowns creating a very toxic environment. I suggested we stop having news on the TV at work and instead leave it on sportsnet or discovery channel. Nothing changed for the trackers i was told it was still mandatory and given a pamphlet on mental health.</p>
<p>Now im a very prideful person and take my beliefs very seriously. To accept this new control at my work would be to betray myself. I would feel even more sick and ashamed of myself.</p>
<p>So becuase of my pride i sat in the cold outside for as much as i could at work the next 2 days. just like i said in my moment of passion when i tore my mask off in that argument. While we did have a heated argument later we apologized and talked about how we need to soppourt eachother at work and stop arguing about bullshit. I made a point that we need to start respecting eachothers beliefs and avoid talking about theese things at work.</p>
<p>So the day comes that the trackers being sent out to everyone and i had caved in my mind. I set mine up with IT and felt the dread settle in. As im setting it up my manager is in the room, and another manager of a different department comes up and starts saying how hes concerned and even though the other manager still got his tracker, it inspired me to stand up for myself again. I told my manager how i felt and i thought came across much better since i wasnt in an emotionally charged state. To my surprise at the end of the day he told me i didnt need to use the tracker and just keep track of it myself.</p>
<p>While it may seem silly and a non issue to some this was a big deal to me and i feel so proud of myself. Some people told me off, others soppourted me. In the end i feel better about myself and feel like ive been given my life and self esteem back.</p>
<p>One of my biggest fears is the creeping tyranny in our lives that is a direct result of how divided we are. I want to ask everyone to put asside our diffeeences in race, religon politics and opinions on theese lockdowns. Come together and help eachother. Be honest with yourselves and others. Only then will we be free.</p>
<p>I hope this post inspires others to stand up for themselves and to treat others with respect.</p></p>

        <p>It's just an easy way to give someone a politically correct I don't really care about this issue and if they bring up the idea will I don't need mental health I'm not angry etc. etc. in the mindset when they're angry even if it is rightfully so and they do not need the mental health help like in this situation that's not gonna help their case that's why it's such a popular thing for employers to do I'm not saying there's not situations where it is needed of course but it can also be a scapegoat ultimately that manager did let our friend here not use that device but that was only after the other manager voice concerns as well</p>

        <p>The mental health thing came from him being genuinely concerned because my behaviour was out of character for me. He also gave it out after sharing some intimate details from when he himself used it.</p>

        <p>While every situation is different I'm glad that you felt like he actually had your best interests in mind and was not simply trying to dismiss your concerns as easily and as politically correct as possible you seem to still have a very optimistic view towards these people there must be some good qualities about your job that you're not mentioning</p>

        <p>I think I would of just quit the moment they said these trackers were needed, or said I will work from home and never come into the office so I won't need one.  I just can't believe we are at the stage where this is an actual thing.</p>

        <p>Agreed.  Even if we disagree with the maskers that believe the hype we should be aware that antagonizing them just exacerbates the problematic differences between us.  </p>
<p>But be proud of yourself. After you calmed down you handled the situation well and like a mature person should.  Kudos :)</p>

        <p>Thank you, this attitude of ridiculing everyone who wears mask is detrimental to this sub in my opinion. In my experience its very dificult to change peoples minds, so we have to try and build understanding.</p>

        <p>The only time I would do that is if someone just gets on my nerves trying to push their agenda on me.  Hey you want to wear a mask because it makes you feel 'safer' by all means.  Rock on.  I personally don't feel 'safer' wearing one and based on what I've read I'm correct.  Hey if it gets me and kills me then it was simply my time. Why are people so afraid of death anyway?  It's a part of life and it can't be avoided.  To me death is just moving on to the next plane of existence whatever it is.  Or maybe I'll reincarnate as a slug.  I don't know.  But I'll find out when I find out I suppose :)</p>

        <p>I don't know what you do for work but I couldn't work around people like that I would even have a problem with being forced to wearing masks in front of each other and not in front of coworkers when it's not a setting like a restaurant where they are moving fast and taking it off would be pointless the local auto shop I'm at only has people that talk to the customers where masks  not the people in the back nobody has a problem</p>
<p>The trackers are ridiculous and I don't even know why people would support that considering these are the people that you're working with you share confined air with them 24 seven if you had afraid that they're in a sneezing cough on you I guess stay away from them but I highly doubt keeping everyone arbitrary 6 feet away will help with asymptomatic cases which are rare when you're with these people for a large portion of the day working close to them breathing the same air so not in logic will be counterintuitive to whatever job you're doing and there will be beeping all the time when people are in a in a rush how long until they start punishing you for beeps if your tracker goes off in excess of five times per day etc.
I also think it's something hilarious that companies made these devices with 6 feet in mind like that's just some arbitrary number that someone came upon in a bunch of countries adopted do they have an extra safe version that's a whole 10 feet</p>

        <p>I'd start looking for another job. If you could get a better wage with a more lax crew it'd be a win-win. Just don't tell anyone you're looking for another job until you find one.</p>
