    <strong>Constant confrontation about mask mandates getting me down</strong>
    <p><p>Hello my online friends
Lately I've been feeling a bit down and the new covid restrictions are starting to take a mental an emotional toll on me. In particular the mask mandate.
In my country wearing a mask is required by law since a couple weeks and you can be fined about 90 euros for not wearing one in public indoor places. I am very much against a mask mandate for multiple reasons, political and health wise. Luckily there is a medical exemption where you don't have to wear a mask if you have a medical condition that prevents you from doing so (this doesn't count in public transport though).</p>
<p>I actually have a medical condition and so far I have been able to get by with saying I fall under the medical exemption and im usually allowed to get in. But I'm beginning to notice that I'm starting to dread going to a store for groceries or a gas station or whatever because everywhere I go there is a confrontation. There are always people asking me to wear a mask or frantically pointing at me and their mount indicating me to wear a mask, or employees shouting at me from a distance that I have to wear a mask, forcing me to shout back at them across the entire store that I have a medical condition that puts me in the exemption. 
Because of my medical condition im usually very tired already or just feel out of it and having these constant confrontations takes a lot of energy from me, to the point where I just prefer not to go out at all, especially if I have to go alone. </p>
<p>Anyone here who feels the same? Did you find a way to deal with these constant confrontations? I need some advice!</p></p>

        <p>But how would that work when you are forced to interact with the employees at the entry of a store telling you to wear a mask when you try to get in? Or other employees inside bothering you about the mask. I see your point but if I ignore them and don't explain myself they will either refuse entry, call security and have me removed from the store or call the police and have them fine me...</p>

        <p>Just yesterday, I was in a shopping plaza parking lot, and wasn't wearing a mask while walking because I will not wear those outside. I had two separate people scream from their cars at me to put my fucking mask on. Aside from those cars, I was only with my SO. Nobody else was around me at all. Yet those people got so upset that I wore no mask, they felt the need to bitch at me about it.</p>
<p>I range from mildly irked to pissed off to depressed whenever this happens. I like being left alone, so having people scream at me like that always unsettles me. I just want to live, and do my own thing in peace. Unless I comply all the time, they will not allow that.</p>

        <p>Ugh I feel you! I am someone who in general just wants to be left alone when I'm outside. But now I constantly have to have awkward interactions with people trying to tell me to wear a mask...</p>

        <p>As much as I can I try to stick with places that are relaxed. I try to get friendly with the workers so they recognize me and go there as often as I can. </p>
<p>Then I can be comfortable showing up without a mask and having regular human interaction. </p>
<p>You might get rejected for not wearing one. If so, just leave. Find a new business that wont hassle you and stick to that one. </p>
<p>Ive had some non-worker self-deputized types ask me to put a mask on. I usually just ignore them like they dont exist. Never had a confrontation past doing just that.</p>

        <p>That might be helpful. If I go to a specific grocery store often enough they will hopefully start to recognize me and remember that I don't wear a mask and just stop bothering me... I havent had the courage to go to my normal regular store for some reason since the mask mandate but maybe if I start going a couple of times I will feel better</p>

        <p>This isn’t PC, but go to poor people grocery stores. They don’t give a shit. I stopped going to the white uppity Publix down the street from my house and drive further to go to the Food Lion. </p>
<p>Wear headphones as you shop even if you aren’t actually listening to anything.</p>
<p>Wear a mesh mask or some other comfortable “covering.” I have a mesh mask. From a distance it looks like I’m complying, but up close you can see through it. I get some stares. I also get a good deal of compliments.</p>

        <p>This is true! I'm not sure about poor people grocery stores, I dont think we really have them here. But I did notice that in ethnic stores and restaurants etc (is that the best way to say it? Im not a native English speaker! I mean in Arabic, Turkish etc places) they are much much more relaxed about the corona measurements</p>
