    <strong>Just a vent</strong>
    <p><p>Just felt like I needed to voice somethings, I live with my grandma (64F). She’s gotten both vaccines and really feeds into all the Covid propaganda being paraded on the news, online, etc. We live in Ontario, Canada where things aren’t looking too bright for us but she adamantly believes things will “go back to normal” when the entire population is all jabbed up. She continuously questions my willingness of not getting the vaccine when I do believe it’s my choice. Recently, she’s been doing her own version of fear-mongering when it comes to me because I refuse to vax plus all of her siblings encourage this since they are all vaxxed. She does this by constantly telling me how many people are getting hospitalized everyday via MSM, even this morning she said to me “oh wow, snow leopards and other animals can now catch Covid!” At this point it honestly all just seems like a joke, I will not be a lab rat. She did none of her own research on the vaccine, just followed everything MSM told her despite my constant attempts to prove her wrong and show her legitimate proof of possible long term effects but to each their own. Ever since her second dose she’s been super weird, saying things she normally wouldn’t and also being pretty vile in regards to almost everything. I think she’s just losing it, but it may be time for me to move out soon before the propaganda makes ask her to leave. Not sure if anyone out there is dealing with something similar but I just want to say that I will never give in, I’m not an anti vaxxer but I’ve seen what this vaccine is doing to people and that’s quite fearing in itself. I understand and I stand by you. ☮️&amp;❤️</p></p>

        <p>Sadly I got jabbed due to the same reason. I have to live with my relatives due to financial reasons and cannot move out.  My parents are in a different country. I was against the vaxx but for last 6 months I was just harassed. My aunt has heart problems and she literally begged for her life asking me to take it. I contemplated on the situation for 3 months but I couldn't take it anymore. Me being a spiritual person followed my gurus method of doing something in times of dire need. I prayed to god and tossed a coin. heads to get vaxxed.  I reported my decision to my guru and he said so be it, do not worry. I got J&amp;J, which too came with mockery from my own home. But on the flip side I asked god for help and took the sign from him. funny enough I didn't get any symptoms from vaccine except for a headache, which I usually get due migraines. 
So do what is best for the situation.</p>

        <p>Why not lie? “Yeah trust me, I got the vax.” Not an option?</p>

        <p>Well that could have been either a way out or could have brought a huge trouble. In Indian culture, Parents/Elders meddle into more things than they should. And I seek truth so lying doesn't come to my mind often.</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to tell the actual point. I don't own a car. My relatives drove me to the vaccination centre. So they would have known nonetheless.</p>
