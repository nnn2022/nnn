        <p>2.7% or more in most countries around the world according to official data, open a corona tracker and click on a random country, then divide deaths by cases... in some very sanitary and sparsely populated countries such as India it is lower though.</p>

        <p>Heh, but then it's pretty dumb to be talking about spiked and second waves based on whatever has been tracked, which is what seems to be happening?</p>
<p>I'm just really impressed that it's so often so close to 2.7%. Like it's really the truth that many independent measurements helped establish.</p>

        <p>First of all, we’re not in any war on the scale of WW1.</p>
<p>Second, the effectiveness of masks is marginal at best. Mask mandates have more to do with equity because health experts it’s unfair that office workers can work from home but retail workers making 1/3 as much have to still go into work. Equity has no place in guiding public policy.</p>

        <p>First of all, I thought that coronavirus was a novel virus and nothing like the flu? </p>
<p>Secondly, On January 27, 1919 the Anti Mask League of San Francisco presented a petition, signed by Mrs. E. C. Harrington as president, to the city's Board of Supervisors, requesting repeal of the mask ordinance. San Francisco lifted the mask requirement effective February 1, 1919, on the recommendation of the Board of Health.</p>

        <p>Well first: the difference is 100 years of science showing universal masking DOES NOT WORK.</p>
<p>And second: there was resistance to the masking. Plenty of it. Even then there were reasonable people and then NPC sheep.</p>

        <p>I understand your sentiment, but masks have not been shown to work. Look at Europe (lockdowns all over the place, national mask mandates with very very high compliance). Look at the actual research. The science didn’t change on this, the politics did and the messaging did.</p>
<p>The survival rate for this virus is very high. It’s approaching the flu at this point. You don’t need to be afraid. 2.8 MILLION people in the US die every year. There are a lot of people in the world and “mass death” has happened every year since the dawn of man.</p>
<p>Don’t be manipulated by a deceptive media who wants to make money on getting you afraid of something that isn’t that scary. And certainly don’t blame your countrymen for being lucid and choosing to not go along with this stuff.</p>

        <p>Well please at least try to stay 6 feet from others and not go touching everything. I’ve seen people licking shit because they’re stupid. I’m going to wear a mask because I’ve seen data showing they do work (mostly as protection for others more than yourself), but if you don’t want to, that’s your right. I’m not really advocating for  mandates (I actually lean libertarian politically), I’m advocating for doing what we can to slow the spread and prevent premature deaths.</p>

        <p>Please - seriously - if you choose to wear a mask please don’t touch it (this isn’t actually possible, everyone touches their mask multiple times per minute, I’m just being diplomatic in asking you not to).</p>
<p>And please change it every two hours. The washable ones aren’t terribly sanitary or effective. You need a disposable changed every two hours, never touched during those two hours, with your hands thoroughly washed every time you change it. If you’re near a sink and soap 8x a day and have a budget for 240 masks a month, you’re better off than most. Go for it. But masks worn unsanitarily aren’t neutral - they are bad. They spread disease. This is one of many many reasons why masking healthy people and entire societies has NEVER been recommended (well in the modern era, 102 years ago notwithstanding) even though contagious respiratory illness has always existed.</p>

        <p>A fraction of the fatality rate and a lack of a war, primarily.  The  specific desperate circumstances may have meant that extreme measures were acceptable at that time, but we aren't living in that time now.  Now, it is very much in everyone's interest to let this disease burn itself out so we can build herd immunity and go back to living our lives.  If masks prevent the spread of disease, they prevent returning to normal.</p>

        <p>Just want to point out that if there was a pro-mask person back then they would point out that the lady in the middle isn't wearing her mask correctly (it's not covering her nose) lol</p>

        <p>Not quite, though your image is from this article, so no doubt you're read it :<a href="http://archive.is/mODU1">http://archive.is/mODU1</a></p>
<p>&rt;That  board’s decision led to the creation of the Anti-Mask League, a sign  that resistance to masks was resurfacing as cities tried to reimpose  orders to wear them when infections returned.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The  league was led by a woman, E.J. Harrington, a lawyer, social activist  and political opponent of the mayor. About a half-dozen other women  filled its top ranks. Eight men also joined, some of them representing  unions, along with two members of the board of supervisors who had voted  against masks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; “It is the most unpopular law ever placed on the Pasadena records,” W.S.  McIntyre, the chief of police, told the paper. “We are cursed from all  sides.” </p>
<p>&rt; He and others stomped on their masks in the street. As a police officer  watched, it dawned on him that “his vigil over the masks was done.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Waiters,  barkeeps and others bared their faces. Drinks were on the house. Ice  cream shops handed out treats. The sidewalks were strewn with gauze, the  “relics of a torturous month,” The Chronicle said.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; San Francisco’s mask ordinance expired after four weeks at noon on Nov. 21. The city celebrated, and church bells tolled. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Suffragists fighting for the right to vote made a gesture that rejected  covering their mouths at a time when their voices were crucial. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;That  was the headline for a report published in The Los Angeles Times when  city officials met in November to decide whether to require residents to  wear “germ scarers” or “flu-scarers.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Public feedback was invited.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Oh, and there is this, <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.10.1.34">https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.10.1.34</a></p>

<p>Controversial then, still is. this is no 1918 pandemic, so why the theatrics?</p>
