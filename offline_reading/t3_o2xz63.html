    <strong>Trying to get Anecdotal Info on vaccine side effects, response to a simple question does not encourage confidence</strong>
    <p><p>I work internationally and am always weighing the risks of getting vs not getting vaccinated, as well as trying to stay informed as my parents generally ask me what to do on these things.</p>
<p>Today I saw a post in CovidVaccinated about someone complaining about them and 5 (or 6?) of their friends all getting covid off the same unvaccinated guy.  I wanted to get clarification from them about that because it wouldn't exactly show high vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>I posted my question, I thought respectfully and after about a minute got perma-banned for "multiple violations of Reddit Content Policy Rule 2" and for "history on misinformation or conspiracies ".   Neither of which I have done to my knowledge.</p>
<p>I am well aware of how much of an echo chamber reddit is, and while I am generally a skeptic of a lot of mainstream narratives, I'd say I'm far from a conspiracy theorist and I am not generally involved in anything on reddit.  But this response makes me extremely wary of any information I come across on subreddits like CovidVaccinated because it seems they are eliminating not just 'misinformation' but also anyone who simply wants to be informed in their decision to take or not take the vaccine.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I also haven't been active here for the reasons above, but don't know where else to ask about anyone's anecdotal experience with vaccine side effects.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>**Update** Upon asking why I was banned for asking my question I was simply muted by the mods.  Are these morons aware that the quickest to make a "conspiracy theorist" out of someone is to label them as one for asking basic and logical questions?</p>

        <p>They will ban you on that sub for saying anything remotely negative about the vaccine. Months ago a nurse commented how he was having heart issues after being vaccinated and the mod said that if he didn’t respond with copies of medical records showing proof of his heart condition that his Post would be deleted. It’s psychotic.</p>
<p>I think it’s really dangerous because people can’t make an informed decision on getting the vaccines when any negative information is completely censored. I won’t be getting the vaccine because I feel like if you have to work this hard to cover up bad outcomes, something deeper is going on.</p>

        <p>I 100% agree, sadly all we can access through mainstream channels is fear porn.  It is so one sided that it isn't even competently pulled off propaganda at this point, it's just blatant fear porn with no actual information.</p>

        <p>It is really sad. It gives me so much anxiety bc I want to understand what is actually happening in this pandemic, how scared should I be, and are the vaccines truly safe and effective. But everyone in any position of authority is just lying and everything else in censored. If you haven’t already, I really suggest the high wire for information. It seems to me the host, Del, tries to get actual unbiased science and interviews those who are seeming to be silenced.</p>

        <p>I definitely feel that.  Not to mention the peer pressure you get if you question anything publicly.  It's at the point where many of my family members, since they can't get any information they know isn't propaganda, just default to believing the exact opposite of whatever is getting peddled.  And at this point I can't really blame, or even strongly disagree with that method.<br>
Thanks for the recommendation though, I'll definitely look into it!</p>

        <p>I think you went about it in the correct way, all you did was pose a question. A very valid one.... the hive mind doesn’t like to be questioned. I think you got your answer just based upon the fact they slapped you with the perma ban. There is literally no proof of “vaccine efficacy.” These are not vaccines. They are gene therapies. Pfizer’s own papers show they can’t prove that it works. The cdcs own website says “the vaccine will not prevent you from getting Covid.” </p>
<p>I don’t know anyone personally who has had MAJOR side effects from the shot. I’m one of the few people I know who still hasn’t and still won’t take it. The few who did have adverse reactions were basically stuck in bed for a few days... I’d be bed ridden from the flu or “covid” than a gene therapy.... My boss informed us that a good customer of ours passed away the other day. He got his second shot like a month or two ago. Connected? No idea. </p>
<p>Time will tell though. We are the guinea pigs. There are control groups and the only ones who know who they are are the big pharma people. The test is going on until 2023. </p>
<p>Look at VAERS and yellow card. The numbers do not lie... and they’re super under reported. More people have died and have been harmed by these shots than ANY AND ALL of the vaccines/shots on the planet combined. In the end it’s your call, most of use here do not care if you do or don’t. We believe in medical freedom, the freedom of choice.</p>
