    <strong>The COVID death count is likely being grossly overinflated. This article claiming 3 young adults died of COVID debunks itself if you read behind the headline.</strong>
    <p><p>https://abcnews.go.com/US/wrecked-lives-families-young-adults-died-covid-19/story?id=74148061</p>
<p>Here's a story about 3 young people who supposedly died of COVID-19. While their deaths are undeniably tragic, I have major doubts that these are COVID deaths. In fact, if the current standard of a "COVID death" refers to any death of any cause while infected with COVID-19, I have strong doubts about the "official" death toll of 250k in America. </p>
<p>The first young adult mentioned in the story, Michael Lang, tested positive but had minor symptoms. He died of sudden cardiac arrest and was found to have inflammation around his heart. However, it's not clear if his COVID diagnosis had anything to do with his cardiac arrest. While there theoretically <em>could</em> be a link, he could have had an undiagnosed heart condition that caused this death. These kinds of heart conditions are rare, but I believe it is far more likely that Michael's death was due to this kind of heart condition than COVID.</p>
<p>The second young adult, Yasmin Pena, was diagnosed with COVID but was also diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disorder. The article states that she died of kidney failure, and again, it's not clear what role COVID played in her death. Lupus and other autoimmune disorders are known to cause kidney problems, and it's far more likely that Yazmin's death was due to lupus-induced complications and not COVID.</p>
<p>The last young adult mentioned, Adeline Fagan, is stated to have had a lengthy battle with COVID-19, but died of a brain aneurysm. Once again, the link to COVID-19 is not clear at all, and it is more than likely that her death did not have to do with COVID. <a href="https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/ub-med-school-grad-dies-of-brain-bleed-after-fighting-covid-19">In fact, another article reveals</a> Adeline was placed on both a ventilator and an ECMO machine, an extremely invasive procedure that bypasses the heart and lungs and has a survival rate of 50% to 75%. The doctor in the article even mentioned that he has seen those kinds of events in ECMO COVID patients. </p>
<p>As we can see, each of these examples of a young adult dying of COVID, in the same article alone, are dubious. Their deaths were more likely than not due to other causes and erroneously attributed to COVID. I believe now more strongly than before that the "official" COVID death count is grossly overinflated due to counting deaths that occur in anyone who dies while testing positive for COVID.</p></p>

        <p>Some people are dying. It’s arguable whether it’s from Covid or not or underlying health issues. I just point out survivability rates. Yes tragic but these are still anecdotal cases. You can’t use anecdotes to push back against statistics. It would be like me saying that in general men are taller than women and someone tells me I’m wrong because his wife is 6’1”.</p>

        <p>They emphasize cases like this because they're "young, healthy people", declaring that they died of Covid in the headlines while sidelining other important medical conditions these people had, which is likely <em>why</em> they died.</p>
<p>3rd case sounds like <em>they</em> caused her death though.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that post viral heart issues are not only associated with covid either.</p>

        <p>I think the problem with this argument is that it doesn't acknowledge the fact that COVID kills by creating these complications. </p>
<p>It sounds like the young man died of a myocardial infarction in the setting of viral myocarditis, the virus being COVID. Yes it’s difficult to prove COVID caused the inflammation, but viruses are the most common cause of myocarditis. Adeline Fagan was placed on a vent and on ECMO to bypass her lungs and heart because her lungs were inflamed enough in the setting of COVID to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome - she couldn’t oxygenate and ventilate on her own. Her heart was strained pumping blood to her diseased lungs hence the ECMO. Sadly, bleeding complications are side effects of putting someone on ECMO but her doctors likely didn’t have a choice. She would have not been on ECMO had she not had ARDS from COVID. </p>
<p>While I’m all for thinking about more measured responses to this virus, it does kill some young people and I think it’s counter productive to argue otherwise.</p>

        <p>&rt; In fact, if the current standard of a "COVID death" refers to any death of any cause while infected with COVID-19</p>
<p>If I might, the current standard refers to any death of any cause <strong>after testing positive</strong> for or <strong>showing symptoms of</strong> COVID-19.  Doesn't necessarily mean infected. </p>
<p>A subtle but even more inclusive definition.  Considering the accuracy of some tests this equates to "eh, it's a fair bet".</p>

<p>I can´t say what the best course of action is. But to argue that covid-19 is a non-issue is harmful and the world will need some kind of safety net for pandemics and catastrophes because the only thing we can be sure of is this will not be the last one.</p>

        <p>These numbers are both premature, and lacking in nuance. The age demos above 65 need to account for maybe 18-24 months of mortality as it's very possible many of these excess deaths are due to "mortality displacement". I regret not saving it, but I read about the quarterly earnings statement for Services Corporation International (SCI) that identified roughly 67% of a sample of 15,000 mortality services performed this year were people who would have died within 2 years. It's certainly not to make light of people dying earlier than they would have, but we do have to understand the costs of lockdowns versus allowing people to go about their lives. This cost analysis was never done at any meaningful level. I'm confident the number of people worldwide being plunged into poverty due to lockdowns will take decades to come back from.</p>
<p>Regarding my comment on nuance, considering suicides are hitting record numbers, cancer treatments seeing drastic reductions, and major reductions in really all kinds of non-Covid related medical treatments, excess deaths MUST include non-COVID deaths as well. These are not caused by COVID, but by lockdowns. Again, we need to see loads of research done in the next couple of years to shake out the true impacts of lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Not entirely sure what your medical credentials are but not sure you are correct.</p>
<p>COVID pericarditis/myocarditis is well documented, viruses in general are one of the most common causes and more likely than a rarer autoimmune condition.</p>
<p>Lupus can cause renal failure but so does COVID, dialysis requiring COVID associated AKI is a significant part of the hospital disease burden. RPGN and lupus associated AKI would not have killed her, you just dialyse after all. COVID AKI and progressive multi-organ dysfunction would.</p>

        <p>Ya I actually agree I think they are all likely legit covid related deaths, although importantly, they all had extenuating circumstances. </p>
<p>The first kid recovered from covid, tested negative, then came home only to die of myocarditis with cardiac arrest. Almost any virus can cause myocarditis. So was this one Covid? I would need to see an autopsy. </p>
<p>The second girl being diagnosed with lupus is strange for instance. There is no known link between covid and lupus. In addition to kidney failure, lupus can also result in severe inflammation of the heart or lungs. It also sounded like she rapidly deteriorated after they put her on the vent. So what killed her? The lupus or the covid? </p>
<p>The third girl was only 28 yet had a strong history of pneumonia and bronchitis in the past. Clearly she had some underlying predisposition to severe respiratory infection. Either there was something structurally wrong with her lungs, or she suffered from a congenital immunodeficiency which was previously undiagnosed. And she died of a brain hemorrhage due to complication of ECMO, not of a brain aneurysm per se. </p>
<p>The point is there still room for doubt in all 3 cases, and if they are real covid deaths, these deaths in young people are <em>incredibly</em> rare.</p>

<p>So rare case of fulminant myocarditis that caused dilated cardiomyopathy. Shame though, according to Harrison's, even these extreme cases if diagnosed correctly are treatable 90% of the time and ejection fraction usually returns to normal.</p>

        <p>I think there's a concern that if you present with severe symptoms, you'll get a COVID test, and if it's positive, you likely won't get tested for anything else. So what happens to the individual who has asymptomatic COVID and a strep infection?</p>

        <p>But why would someone who presented with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection get further tested if they were COVID-positive? Sure, I can see testing for both flu and COVID now that it's the season, but if I am sick and test positive for COVID and begin treatment for that, why would I need further testing?</p>

        <p>The swabs normally also test for other flus. If you are sick yhen chest xray +- HRCT is standard, as well full admission bloods and blood cultures. </p>
<p>Only if you are seen in primary care and completely well, sould you stop at COVID swab, only then.</p>
