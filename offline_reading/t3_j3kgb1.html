    <strong>Anyone given up on their friends coming around?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know about all of you but most of my friends have been mask nazi's since the beginning of this thing. At first it was cute and I could play ball because I assumed they'd come around eventually. </p>
<p>Now we're 7(8?) months in and they still are only comfortable hanging out in a park 6 feet apart. They suggested if we want to hangout in the winter we do so around a fire in someones backyard and bring blankets. They are nuts, I'm done with it. I don't hate them by any means but I've lost all trust in them, I can't help but imagine how they'd react if we ever truly had a real end of the world situation.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had to deal with this kind of thing? How are you dealing with it, am I just being too harsh? Because I could see it that way too, I'm just kind of at my wits end waiting around for them when it's very clear they have no intentions of going back to normal.</p></p>

        <p>I’ve been hanging out with friends like normal. Thankfully none of them are doomers. I don’t blame you for not wanting to be around people like that, anyone who is still that scared 7 months into this is living in another reality than you.</p>

        <p>Fuck you are lucky to have those friends man, I'm very jealous!
Unfortunately this is my entire friend group that is like this and I broke up with my girlfriend a few weeks ago so I now have literally no one to have a normal hangout with anymore.
My new friend circle consists of my mom and girls I go out with on tinder lol.</p>

        <p>I live right in the heart of LA and I have a group of friends from childhood that before COVID I would semi regularly have potluck dinners with. Most of them have been complete doomers over all of this, and besides a brief "socially distanced" meetup in a park back in June, haven't done anything else with them. Well things have changed, as we're scheduled to actually have a full on dinner this weekend at one of their houses, and it was one of them that suggested doing it. I think more and more people are coming around, though to be fair it's still pretty bad here in LA.</p>

        <p>I'm very selective of my friends so fortunately very few of them have been so retarded as to believe all the propaganda.</p>
<p>Honestly I wouldn't care too much about "firing" a friend who proved to be an insufferable moron, such as a these freaks that love wearing masks and enjoy being under house arrest. I'd rather surround myself with nobody than a bunch of people that make me miserable and angry. Besides, it would give me more time to enjoy my hobbies.</p>

<p>It's not even boot-licking anymore, it's boot-deepthroating. Though that wouldn't even be a problem if they wouldn't want to force it on everyone else, <em>that's</em> the thing I despise about them.</p>

<p>Forcing others to inhale the exhausted air the body just tried to get rid of - enriched with some bacteria- and fungi-colonies isn't selfish - it's fascist. If you don't like being oppressed by fascism you're apparently selfish, probably like all the jews that didn't want to wear a yellow star.</p>

        <p>As crazy as this sounds I'm Jewish and I equate wearing that mask with wearing the star. I took that mask off and if anyone asks I'll gladly tell them I'm trying to build herd immunity and also they can fuck right off.</p>

        <p>One of my friends is being weird but her husband takes some heavy prescriptions that make him immunocompromised, so I sorta get it. They are young though and he doesn’t have a history of having any bad flu or cold symptoms. I’ve long suspected his illnesses are...kinda overblown but that’s another matter. </p>
<p>Almost everyone else is 100% done. Went to plenty of parties over the summer. Gonna go to a halloween party. A handful of them might still act like masks are vital but they’re more saying it as a formality because they’re bartenders who want to keep their jobs. Basically their only argument is please just wear a mask and don’t start shit with people in bars and restaurants, they’re already under enough stress. It isn’t their decision. They don’t give a shit about going to parties and not wearing masks.</p>
<p>I have hopes the one friend will come around but she is normally a shut in anyway. I suggested I bring over canvas and paints and we do an online painting class and she was down, but she still doesn’t want to go out.</p>
<p>I couldn’t be around full on doomers. There’s no fun or joy in living like that or being around people like that.</p>

        <p>Most of my friends are either completely over all of it or will at least come hang out at the house and drink and chill. Everyone knows everyone else in my circle isn’t going to underground raves or packed places. We go to outside bars &amp; restaurants. I occasionally sit inside but no one knows that about me. People will gather and meet up for stuff no problem. </p>
<p>I have a few acquaintances that are just shitting a brick but even theyve caved and taken vacations and had outdoor gatherings at the very least. I am not associated with anyone who refuses to leave their home thank god. Even my most doomer friends are starting to crack.</p>

        <p>Very sorry to hear that. I have a few friends that I'm fairly confident I might never see again and to be quite honest, I am 100% ok with that. I've just lost nearly all respect for them. </p>
<p>It's lonely and not really the same thing, but I had a falling out with my best friend in my mid-20s, was a fairly tight friend group and they all took his side. So I kind of just stopped hanging with them all. Was weird for a bit, but I got through it and made new friends.</p>

        <p>Yeah. Well I’m not really friends with them anymore but they dropped me in May over covid. They’re all girls in their early twenties. I’ve noticed women tend to be more doomer-ish, and (sorry if I offend anyone) unattractive men are really doomer-ish too. </p>
<p>My husband and his friends are in their early twenties. They bring the TV outside and watch from the hot tub and drink. I’m about to go join them. They’re definitely cool and do not care at all about covid. Sorry to say it but I’ve definitely observed that attractive young men seem to care the least. Now I’m about to go observe some attractive young men up close.</p>

        <p>It's because women are significantly more neurotic than men [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2031866/">1</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00320.x">2</a>].</p>
<p>Definition of <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/neurosis">Neurosis</a>:</p>
<p><em>A relatively mild mental illness that is not caused by organic disease, involving symptoms of stress (depression, anxiety, obsessive behaviour, hypochondria) but not a radical loss of touch with reality.</em></p>
<p>You can see how most (all?) of those symptoms - especially hypochondria - would make a person irrationally terrified of covid. I suspect most male doomers are also highly neurotic.</p>
<p>As for why ugly young woman are more neurotic, well, ugly people have more to feel insecure about which would worsen anxiety and depression. I also imagine it would be a bit of a vicious cycle (e.g. comfort eating and self neglect due to depression and anxiety caused by being ugly, making them uglier). And of course, young people are famously full of angst and insecurity.</p>
<p>An ugly young woman is unsurprisingly going to be very neurotic, making them exceedingly doomerish.</p>

        <p>I wonder if women tend to be more doomer-ish because statistically, they use platforms like Instagram more than men. Therefore, they are exposed to the mask propaganda more and subsequently participating in it. Ya know, to feel like they are fitting in. Also P.S. I’m a woman. Not disparaging women, just making note of our Instagram usage.</p>

        <p>Yeah I use Instagram often. I’m pregnant so I’ve been home a lot and on my phone. It’s probably a contributing factor towards the doomer mentality.</p>

        <p>I'm a dude and can definitely attest to this, can see it in more women, not sure if ugly guys are more doomer-ish but I can certainly see it the "beta" ones.</p>
<p>Unfortunately all my guy friends are totally whipped by their girlfriends and so they have to be doomer by proxy.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah... I have a few different groups of friends. Some who have been bucking this whole thing since the beginning, talking about how much bs it all is, and hanging out like normal, sharing food and hugs. </p>
<p>And then I have some who will say things like, “Come over for a distanced porch hang!” And to be honest, just them latching on to that phrasing makes me want to barf. Needless to say, I have often been quite busy with work the times group B has reached out. It makes me feel terrible and really, really heartbroken. </p>
<p>But entering a situation with people you are supposed to be close with that is weird and uncomfortable before you even get there is not fun, it’s not engaging, it’s not productive, and it feels terribly lacking in heart and soul. </p>
<p>That being said, I’m still trying to be empathetic and to understand that these people have been scared and it’s not their fault that they are scared. They’ve been pummeled with this shit for months. Some people take it differently than others. So I try to respect that, even though I don’t agree with it. Although, that gets harder and harder with each day. Because sometimes I just want to scream, “don’t you see what you’re doing to yourselves?!” </p>
<p>So...I guess I’m taking preventative measures with these people to not ruin our friendship by telling them I think they are dumb. We still have many other things in common and none of them are bad people. They’ve just latched on to the madness and I will see them when they’ve latched off.</p>

        <p>I’ve had to deal with something similar.  My best friend was living in fear for a while.  She has finally come around but we’re not even close anymore.  It’s unfortunate that there are so many broken restrictions all because of fear and the restrictions.  I never stopped hanging out with others just because the government said not and I never will.  I ain’t got time to live in fear.</p>

<p>It's pathetic but also pity arousing, imagine thinking the blatant garbage spewed on the news where even remotely close to reality. They are lost, and it's painful in it's own way.</p>

        <p>Most of my friends are the types of people who are going to laugh at Trump testing positive. They have not changed their views at all and are still supportive of masks and shutdowns. Even the people I know whose jobs have been affected support the restrictions. We all know it’s one thing to be pro-lockdown when you have a job, but it’s bizarre to me that people who were furloughed or saw their companies take a hit still sing Wolf’s praises. I have a few friends who act mostly normal but still support masks. </p>
<p>I only have one friend with a lot of common sense. She wears PPE at her job and a mask in public where required but she still lives her life and even quit the gym once they required masks for workouts. Even with wearing PPE at her nursing home job, she doesn’t support rules like that outside of work.</p>

        <p>Not me because the two people still living in abject terror over this are out of my life.  However, our two mutual friends have basically given up on them and I think myself and my husband had something to do with it.  Basically, with us, they get to hang out in person and go to things with us (like trivia and game nights) We'll also never shame them for wanting to live like normal.  With the other couple (the friends who cut me off) they get zoom hangouts and long rants about how people like them are the reason we can't go back to normal.  Our two mutual friends realized that they get the better deal with us.</p>

        <p>Its a piece of cloth.  You guys say we, the people who follow CDC procedures, are overreacting; and yet you refuse to wear what is no more inconvenient then your basic wristwatch?  It is not fear, no it is concern.  Concern for our fellow humans.  We are all in this together, whether it matters to you or not.  And, if anyone makes the argument that masks might not be effective, well then I am happy to do a slight gesture such as wear a mask to protect someone's wife, someone's husband, someone's son or daughter, and someone's parents.  Wearing is Caring.  I wish you all the best.</p>
