        <p>I grew up with parents that didn‚Äôt trust doctors. I thought they were nuts. After becoming an adult and having a few doctor ‚Äúfriends,‚Äù I completely agree. They think they know everything. As a professional, I have a certain area of expertise. When my friends come to me for questions related to my field but outside of that area of expertise, I politely tell them it‚Äôs outside of my experience. I may know more than them on the subject, but I know I‚Äôm not expert even though my profession umbrellas that area. The majority of these experts may have a medical degree but they are not virologists or epidemiologists. Even then, they don‚Äôt know everything. It‚Äôs crazy people ask their PCP about the vaccines. They don‚Äôt know better than the average Joe!</p>

        <p>So for joint pain and inflammation, turmeric is really good. Black pepper helps with absorption. Then, palmitoylethanolamide can help with pain (it has been shown to boost anandamide levels--people with high anandamide levels attest to always feeling happy and feeling little pain) and its absorption is also boosted by turmeric and black pepper.</p>
<p>Dimethyl sulfoxide has also shown to help with pain but I can go into more detail on it in a bit.</p>
<p>Can't ever go wrong with magnesium chelate either</p>

        <p>Thanks!! Yeah I‚Äôve been doing tumeric and black pepper boiled in goat milk and taking curcumin+pepperine pills. It works miracles!</p>
<p>Magnesium is great too, have been supplementing with B complex as I find it helps the nerves and muscles. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve heard of DMS and will research it further!</p>
<p>First time I‚Äôm hearing of palimotyethanolmide. I‚Äôll look into it!</p>
<p>Also as a PSA to you and whomever you think it‚Äôs relevant to, I was able to cure myself of seasonal allergies by mega dosing on vitamin C (the good stuff with bioflavonoids) during pollen season. Legit took 10-20k mg a day (over a day) and my allergies were non existent. This year I didn‚Äôt even need to megadose. </p>
<p>Thanks and Godspeed!</p>

        <p>That's great! Is there a certain reason you boil them in goat milk or is it just for taste? I've heard of people doing "golden" turmeric lattes.</p>
<p>DMSO is relatively unknown but I'll happily drop you a link. It is very molecularly similar to water and mimics in the body. It may be the best anti inflammatory there is and also helps boost the absorption of other substances but the only downside is it can make you wreak of DMSO which many compare to a garlic/vegetable smell. But, the only solution I've heard of for that is drinking milk and no one seems to know why that is.</p>
<p>Palmitoylethanolamide is super unknown but yeah. My friend makes a mixture that boosts absorption with it that he sells. I sent some to my friend after her wrist surgery and she loved it and bought some of just the palmitoylethanolamide itself and has good effects but says it can feel different. </p>
<p>I've read about megadosing vitamin C. Last time I got sick, I took 3 grams every hour on and off but (and this could have been related to the sickness as well) got insane IBS. Quercetin is a fantastic natural allergy remedy and I've also heard moringa helps with allergies but it is a superfood, packed with nutrients and is super good for you on its own</p>

I also faced IBS-C when I took 6 glasses of citrus fruit juice and 6 glasses of coconut water only liquid diet throughout the day, it helped me cure my flu but then I think I faced IBS-c maybe because of high amount of vitamin c and fibre ?</p>

        <p>Sadly, vaccine injuries are one of the hardest things to accurately correlate. Not to say they don't happen ALL the time, but there are so, so, so many factors that it is about as difficult to directly link every symptom/injury to vaccines as it is to link chronic illnesses with one of the many artificial and likely carcinogenic ingredients allowed in our foods. Or GMOs. Or fluoride in our water. You get the point.</p>
<p>IIRC, the CDC estimated that 100xs the number of vaccine injuries reported go unreported. </p>
<p>As difficult as it can be to correlate certain things, it is truly astonishing that some people actually believe getting an experimental drug and dying 24 hours later must be unrelated. </p>
<p>However, doctors who say anything even slightly negative about vaccines and/or mention anything to make people question their efficacy can and will swiftly lose their license and potentially land in jail. If that isn't suspicious, add the fact that manufactures legally have 0 liability for any injury their drugs may cause. Almost like they are well aware of their potential dangers and only care about making money and manufacturing illness.</p>

        <p>Rockefeller medicine. Doctors only know what they are told to know and told to believe is the truth.</p>
<p>Like, for example, in the 80s when all doctors were taught about opioids was "They help with pain, give them for any kind of pain!"</p>
<p>Now, there are still plenty of doctors who are good people, but they are sadly led astray by their unwillingness (and inability) to question many aspects of their profession and day to day procedures. </p>
<p>This might sound a bit extreme for the average modern mind, but the Buddha said that anyone who practices medicine in exchange for money is unfit to be a doctor. Look where doing so has gotten us. Soon PCPs may be replaced by literal pharmaceutical vending machines.</p>

        <p>I agree that we are not taught to think for ourselves. Institutions, funded by different corporations with different agendas, tell us what the facts are. Luckily, my profession relies on analytical thinking. So, I was actually taught to read the laws and come to a conclusion. Many of us can read the same thing and see different conclusions. These conclusions can be argued and debated. But, my own stupidity still surprises me at times. We are all influenced greatly by things that we were taught to be true without ever even considering otherwise.</p>

        <p>Yes. The educational system tends to teach everything except for critical thinking. Philosophy seems as dead as disco oftentimes.</p>
<p>What you say reminds me of my many psychedelic trips where suddenly I came to realize that even the most basic things I was always told and never questioned may have been just as fabricated, untrue, and/or easily believed in as Santa Claus. I am a skeptic above all else and find that tends to be the best approach to most things. Sure, I want to believe what I want to believe, but, when it comes down to it--and especially as far as "science" or politics are concerned--I have no real horse in the race either way and thus leaning one way or another really makes no difference to me. It could be true. It could not be true. All science ever seems to prove is that science was wrong and that typically seems to be the case, whether it takes 1 year or 100 years. It may or may not be a real Buddha quote and I'll probably notch it here but "Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who has said it--or even if I said it--unless it aligns with your own conscious understanding and reasoning."</p>

        <p>They did the same thing with cigarettes decades ago. Scientists determined the harm was caused by the "nicotine delivery system"; the tobacco companies had spent decades creating the most addictive product possible. </p>
<p>In their conclusion, instead of suggesting certain practices that made cigarettes so addictive be banned, they said they should be taxed.</p>
<p>Weird eh? Government funded scientist suggest the government earn more from them, and the cigarette companies, and ignore the cause.</p>

        <p>&rt;Lancet Paper reveals that COVID jab efficacy is far lower than reported when Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is considered (that is, the difference between attack rates with and without a vaccine, considering the whole population): 1¬∑3% for AZ, 1¬∑2% for the Moderna, 1¬∑2% for J&amp;J, 0¬∑84% for Pfizer.</p>
<p>Wait, it's not like only a handful of people have gone through their full round of shots ! I'm no statistician, but they would have to show how the amount of people who have been "fully" jabbed is not enough to make any inferences.  </p>
<p>The ARR, before mass distribution was like 0.7%(.007) in a sample size of 44,000 flippin people !! Come on, man !</p>

From what I'm reading, doesn't this just mean that ARR is just the chance of you still getting covid after being vaccinated, while the RRR is about vaccinating a whole population?</p>

        <p>Deep down I knew this was true. There's no way in hell that any of these vaccines are 95%+ effective. It's official, the risk HEAVILY outweighs the benefit.</p>

<p>&rt;    <strong>Outcome Reporting Bias in COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Clinical Trials</strong></p>
<p>&rt;    by Ronald B. Brown</p>

<p>&rt;    Received: 13 January 2021 / Revised: 15 February 2021 / Accepted: 22 February 2021 / Published: 26 February 2021</p>
<p>&rt;    (This article belongs to the Special Issue Pandemic Outbreak of Coronavirus)</p>
<p>&rt;    <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>&rt;    Relative risk reduction and absolute risk reduction measures in the evaluation of clinical trial data are poorly understood by health professionals and the public. The absence of reported absolute risk reduction in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials can lead to outcome reporting bias that affects the interpretation of vaccine efficacy. The present article uses clinical epidemiologic tools to critically appraise reports of efficacy in Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine clinical trials. Based on data reported by the manufacturer for Pfzier/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2, this critical appraisal shows: relative risk reduction, 95.1%; 95% CI, 90.0% to 97.6%; p = 0.016; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; 95% CI, 0.59% to 0.83%; p &lt; 0.000. For the Moderna vaccine mRNA-1273, the appraisal shows: relative risk reduction, 94.1%; 95% CI, 89.1% to 96.8%; p = 0.004; absolute risk reduction, 1.1%; 95% CI, 0.97% to 1.32%; p &lt; 0.000. Unreported absolute risk reduction measures of 0.7% and 1.1% for the Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, are very much lower than the reported relative risk reduction measures. Reporting absolute risk reduction measures is essential to prevent outcome reporting bias in evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy.</p>

        <p>That study has a similar finding, so I don‚Äôt see your point. </p>
<p>I never said that it‚Äôs wrong, I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre misinterpreting it if you think this means we were lied to about vaccine efficacy, as a Lacet Paper study points out, too. </p>
<p>RRR and ARR are different measurements and you can‚Äôt directly compare them. For example, the absolute risk of you being attacked by a shark while grocery shopping is very low. However, once you get into the ocean, your relative risk of being attacked by a shark goes up. The same thing has been demonstrated by these studies with Covid and the Covid vaccines. Your overall risk of dying of Covid is about 1% according to the studies, and these vaccines are effective at preventing infections‚Äî95% for the Pfizer as these studies point out. </p>
<p>This post shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what this study says, again, like what a co-author of the study points out in the politifact fact check.</p>
