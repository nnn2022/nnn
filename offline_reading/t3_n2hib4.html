    <p><p>Oh wait, you don't have to 💀</p>
<p>Edit: my posts are being downvoted and upvoted at the same time lmao. </p>
<p>These people couldn't read or use critical literacy if their lives depended on it. Instead, they grovel and get one threat from an unhinged dude and say "this guy sent a rape threat and talked about Jews" like all of us agree with that dumb shit. Obviously, we don't. These people are trying so hard to ban and report all our shit because they simply can't stand actual statistics and research. </p>
<p>They would rather virtue signal and act holier than thou because they use the fear instilled by an untrustworthy government and media as an excuse. They base their world view off fear-mongering sentences spewed by the government/media that say they have researched but in reality, its shallow research that is bent and they don't read it themselves.</p>
<p>These people take everything at face value, who instead of researching and listening to other people's researched opinions to have an open discussion, they deflect and ignore anything you say. No, they would rather attempt brigading, reporting, and ban people who share info against mainstream narratives because of FEAR.</p>
<p>Like who are you trying to save with a 99% survival rate, you ain't changing any of our minds. God forbid someone does research and believes something on this sub. Absolute insanity</p></p>

        <p>I follow theycantsuicideusall on IG, you should see 👀 the 3 part story posted yesterday!!!!!!! Some rando found a video of a stranger wearing a see through thin mask and this psycho decided to make several social media posts about it, report her to the airline co, the police, the feds etc. Then went further to stalk this strangers social media and report her entire life. I have never seen such a crazed psychotic act- calculated insanity and this psycho cannot grasp any reality what so ever. These people are sick</p>

        <p>I got banned from Covidvaccinated because I told someone who was questioning getting the vaccine that they should follow their gut instinct and just wait it out. I said that they are still in clinical trials and you are not right or wrong for whatever you choose. I got banned for conspiracy? Lol</p>

        <p>Slightly disingenious of you, when your actual comment was this:</p>
<p>&rt;If you’re on the fence, don’t do it. That’s your gut telling you to wait it out. You’re not wrong for getting it or not getting it. If you are not 100% sure, then don’t get it. A lot of people are worried about the long term effects of this vaccine. It is still in its testing phase which means that <strong><em>we are the test subjects</em></strong>. You’re not wrong to question it.</p>
<p>Unless you've signed up for the phase III trial, you're not a test subject. Talking about it like that is a clear indicator of buying into the conspiracy fearmongering around the vaccine.</p>
<p>Considering that you've been posting in /r/conspiracy (and NNN) prior to posting that comment I'm not surprised the mods chose to ban you.</p>
<p>&rt;A lot of people are worried about the long term effects of this vaccine.</p>
<p>Strictly true but that doesn't hold weight over whether there are actually negative long term effects of it.</p>

        <p>Oh thank you, I didn’t know how to find my comment. It had disappeared when I was banned and I don’t really understand Reddit. I mean test subject as in you literally don’t know what is going to happen... we don’t know the long term effects yet and we won’t for a few more months when the first clinical trial is finished. I guess I could have used something else besides “test subject”.</p>

<p>We already have almost a year of data from tens of thousands of test subjects in the phase II-III trials. The phase III trials might uncover some <em>very</em>, <strong><em>very</em></strong> rare side effects, but the vaccine has already been shown to be much safer than getting infected with the virus itself.</p>
