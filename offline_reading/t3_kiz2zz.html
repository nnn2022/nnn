    <strong>Principles</strong>
    <p><p>Anytime someone says "it's just..." or "why can't you just..." I realize they do not understand the concept of principles. Because if they did they would realize nothing important to someone is ever "just..." Principles are the most important thing to have. If you don't draw the line somewhere, if there is not something you simply won't do, you are not a man.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed. I was telling my in-laws the problem is people lack integrity, in fact they never had it to begin with, otherwise they would stand against a violation of their principles. This is why I don't wear masks.</p>

        <p>If someone doesn't mind wearing masks then fine. But if they don't understand why someone else wouldn't "just wear the mask" then they likely lack integrity.</p>

        <p>This is an interesting take, but only works in the person claimed to hold those principles above everything else. Principles are important, but often there are practical trade-offs that are agreed upon by everyone in today's society. </p>
<p>For example, laws limit peoples' freedoms in order to protect property, i.e., you can't step onto someone else's property without their permission. This violates the principle of freedom, but no one would say that this is unreasonable; most often, there are tradeoffs between principles, in this case, between someone's property rights and others' freedom. </p>
<p>In the same vein, these reactions only mean that they believe certain values are more important than others, in this case, safety over freedom. And that is a legitimate belief to hold: there are regulations about the temperatures, cleanliness, and types of food production allowed to protect consumers at the cost of freedom of producers, of course, one could think that there are too many or too few regulations, and that is the point, that individuals can have different types of beliefs on this sort of thing.</p>

        <p>Yes, people can have different beliefs, but it is the people who don't understand how someone would have an uncompromising belief that I am referring to. I am not saying you have to refuse masks. I am saying if someone refuses masks, then they are acting on principle, and people who don't understand that don't understand principles.</p>

        <p>That makes sense, but if the law said mandated masks, would you follow it? It's my belief that I should, because in my opinion, in general, we can't have individuals making their own choices based on their unique beliefs when it comes to a question of a balance of rights, rather there should be a standard for everyone to follow, right?</p>

        <p>Jefferson said it was your duty to oppose unjust laws. A law requiring everyone to wear a mask everywhere for no good reason is unjust.</p>

        <p>But then you'd understand how these people you're referring to feel right? Because just like how you think they don't understand principles, they think the same way about you about your beliefs which aren't complying with a law they agree with.</p>

        <p>Oh, come off it.  Morals don't dictate chromosomes.  This is a textbook definition of an ad hominem attack.  I don't disagree with you at all about the importance of holding principles, but it has nothing to do with gender.</p>
