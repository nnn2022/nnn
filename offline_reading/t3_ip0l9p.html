    <strong>Kid from my school committed suicide last night. Thanks, doomers.</strong>
    <p><p>Using a throwaway because I doubt there were very many suicides of high school kids last night so you could probably figure out where I go to school based on this post. </p>
<p>We should be having in-person classes right now. There’s no doubt in my mind that online school (and the general doom and gloom shared daily by the media, but especially online school) was part of the reason he ended up committing suicide since he wasn’t able to see his friends every day like he would if we were in-person.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 0 people with any connection to the school at all have died from corona. No students, no family members of students, no teachers, no family members of teachers, no friends of anyone I know in this entire metroplex, no one. So in my bubble and as far as I’m concerned, the “cure” has been a hell of a lot worse than the disease. But if schools were open, many more people would die from corona, say the doomers! At least he didn’t die from corona!</p>
<p>That’s all I’ll say. I’m not asking for sympathy or anything because I wasn’t close friends with him, but it’s just sad that this is how things are. 
I was always a little upset that schools weren’t open for selfish reasons, but now I’m fucking pissed.</p>
<p>I hope the doomers are happy.</p></p>

        <p>Wishing you luck with that, but given the way California's politics skew, I'm not hopeful.</p>
<p>You might see support in the interior of the state, in the northern half, maybe even in San Diego, but what about that liberal strip between SF and LA?</p>

        <p>I don't know how LA's opinion has shifted, but here in the SF Bay Area, there's enough of an effort I see. Several stores in my county are hosting petition collections or petitions people can walk in and sign.</p>
<p>There's more reasons for the recall efforts gaining momentum. The left actually isn't approving of him because they feel he hasn't done enough and he "caved in" to demands for any reopenings.</p>
<p>It's the exact opposite momentum we can't afford in the long term, but as long as it gets rid of Newsolini, we can use it and game the system in favor of a more moderate governor. And Southern California, and even some parts of LA county, are very conservative and would be energized by such a shift.</p>

        <p>I'm with you. We started with "flatten the curve" and it turned into you can't leave your house till we force you to take a vaccine. A country doesn't fundamentally reorganize the way businesses are run if it isn't permanent. People being hopeful that the lockdowns will end are delusionally optimistic!</p>

        <p>" It’s not profitable take Australia for example they are in recession "</p>
<p>It has been highly profitable for some very rich people. The big box stores will benefit from this, in the long run, because the administration of the lockdowns have frequently been discriminatory in a way that favors them: they have been allowed to stay open, while the independent stores which competed with them were frequently forced to stay closed, even when they had more than enough floor space to operate within social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>Have you been outside for the last few months? Is there anything I just told you that we have not all seen with our own eyes? I sense that you will ask me for a source for this, but that's a little like asking for a source supporting the claim that the Sun rises in the East. "Just go look" is sometimes argument enough, and it certainly is when the same thing has been done by almost every state in the Union.</p>
<p>The lockdown has been highly profitable for online firms, because people are more reliant on those for the ordering of goods, and for what passes for human contact, these days.</p>
<p>Rich people contribute to political campaigns, and can be very, very generous, so politicians benefit from that. As for the impact the lockdowns have had on the rest of us, yes, we've taken a massive loss, but what happens when any of us try to speak up on our own behalves? We get dogpiled by doomers, and on a number of platforms, get silenced. On Reddit, our comments get downvoted into oblivion, and on Twitter, Facebook and Youtube, our content is deleted (and sometimes, our accounts suspended) for violating "community guidelines" into which viewpoint discrimination has been blatantly built. Our suffering doesn't matter, even though we've (not surprisingly) lost more than the privileged few have gained, because most of the time, we can't make ourselves heard, and when we do, we find that most of the other little people have turned into docile, compliant little sheep, afraid to speak up or even question the official party line on much of anything. </p>
<p>" Edit: Okay your all actually insane I’m out "</p>
<p>The only insanity I've seen in this discussion, so far, has been your own hysterical response to the fact that others didn't agree with you.</p>
<p>By the way, "your" is the possessive. The contraction you should have used is "you're." Please make a note of it.</p>

        <p>No I haven’t been outside, wanna know why? I do what I’m told and keep myself and the ones I love and the others in my community safe 😉. Next you’ll be telling me that this whole thing was biologically made to make the rich richer and that, that will make my day. I agree that their choices of businesses that got to stay open and had to close was fucking dumb but you vote with your money, if you don’t wanna support them don’t give them money.</p>

<p>Our favorite troll would seem to be attempting what one might call "the Hogg Maneuver." Remember David Hogg, the mouthy teenager from Parkland who wanted to unilaterally write the gun laws for the US? Remember the attempt to silence any criticism of his views under the theory that since he was underage, any counter-argument he encountered would qualify as harassment of a minor?</p>
<p>u/CrunchyPac would seem to be trying to make use of that same odd theory that adults have a duty to be seen and not heard when the teens decide to speak. While the theory is lacking in legal merit for obvious reasons, the fact that CP would sink to trying to trump up such a charge that says a lot about him.</p>
<p>He's a psychopath. I'd recommend blocking him, immediately.</p>

<p>Gosh, BillyBob, that sounds sort of ageist. Aren't you supposed to be sent in for re-education, now?   🙂  </p>
<p>Also, times don't really change as much as you personally would like to think they do. While the kind of unquestioning, boot licking obedience you describe might be <em>perceived</em> as a virtue in some circles, today, it remains an expression of cowardice. Cowardice remains a damnable vice, especially in an alleged republic, no matter what the general population thinks about the matter.</p>
<p>Cowardice enables tyrants. It also makes rational discussion of almost anything impossible.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>\&rt;   "you probably think that it’s wrong to use proper gender pronouns </p>
<p>\&rt; and  that girls should have less rights than men, and even if you</p>
<p>\&rt; say you  don’t your logic is still the same as that so shut up."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What exactly are you trying to say in this garbled passage?, u/CrunchyPac? Sounds like you're angry with u/ShakeyCheese for not sharing what you perceive to be his hatred of women and transpeople with you? Why would that be? Are you a misogynistic transphobe? You do seem to get angry whenever you aren't being validated, so that would seem to be the best explanation of your behavior. Tsk, tsk ...</p>
<p>You really are in need of sensitivity training, and maybe a hug. Not that I'm offering one.</p>

        <p>Yes, a number of them do. I think CP is hoping to get this group brigaded by angry feminists and angrier trans activists, and that this is why he went off onto that bizarre tangent. I think he's hoping we'll say something he can quote, and use to bring people in.</p>

        <p>&rt; "No I haven’t been outside,"</p>
<p>Which means that you're either lying through teeth like the troll you are, or are so rich that you can afford to have your food delivered to you, every day, and have the nerve to be self-righteous toward those who have to wander outside in order to avoid death from starvation, literally.</p>
<p>In the latter case I'd have to ask, do the words "check your privilege" mean anything to you?</p>
<p>&rt;  "wanna know why?"</p>
<p>Not particularly, but I'm sure you'll tell me.  🙄</p>
<p>&rt; "I do what I’m told"</p>
<p>The willingness on the part of the population to believe that's a good thing, in and of itself, is one of the signs that one is in a developing police state. I see that you would be proud to be part of such a trend.</p>
<p>But in most of the US, at least, what you are hinting at is a lie. In most of the US, we've never been told that we could not go out for groceries, or even for exercise. That's a talking point pushed by some very loud control freaks on the Internet, not something that has been part of the so-called "stay at home" orders anywhere outside of a relatively few unlucky communities.</p>
<p>&rt; "and keep myself and the ones I love and 
&rt; the others in my community safe 😉."</p>
<p>That talking point has been debunked at length, repeatedly, already. Time for you to set up a straw man, and here it is ...</p>
<p>&rt; "Next you’ll be telling me that this whole thing
&rt; was biologically made to make the rich richer 
&rt; and that, that will make my day."</p>
<p>While you'll tell me that whatever the herd believes must surely be true. That wouldn't make my day, because unlike you, I have a life outside of the Internet.</p>
<p>Now tell me, before I block you (because I can see that you're all mouth and no brain), what exactly makes you feel qualified to have an opinion on the science? What makes you feel that your layman's opinion about this subject is worth more than that of the scientists at the World Health Organization who did a study that found that asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 was very rare</p>
<p>https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread-who-bn/index.html</p>
<p>only to find that their own organization backing down and recanting in response to bullying on social media? What makes you believe (assuming that you actually do) that your own voice and those of your fellow trolls together carry more weight than do those of a number of actual PhDs?</p>
<p>As for myself, I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics specializing in Probability, so I might just possibly, conceivably know a little bit more about Mathematics than you do. Two of my brothers are physicians, one of them a clinical researcher, and my father is the former head of medicine at his hospital (and a medical researcher himself), so when I have question about medicine, all I need to do to get good information is either pick up the phone or text somebody, and I frequently do. And you know what - a lot of what we hear on the Internet is bullshit.</p>
<p>What a surprise - a group of uneducated nobodies posting in a deliberately inflammatory way turned out to not be the best source of information, ever. Who woulda thunk, Billy Bob?</p>
<p>&rt; I agree that their choices of businesses that got to stay open
&rt; and had ad to close was fucking dumb</p>
<p>So you've granted my point, but you're going to personally attack me for raising it. Should tell the reader something about what kind of person you are, shouldn't it?</p>
<p>You obviously aren't somebody who places any value on the truth. </p>
<p>&rt; "but you vote with your money, if you don’t wanna
&rt; support them don’t give them money."</p>
<p>More easily said than done when, thanks to the venal use of government power, there's nowhere else left to purchase the things one needs to use. Also, you're missing the point, quite deliberately I suspect.</p>
<p>During the time of the forced shutdown of smaller businesses, the bills have been piling up for those businesses, at a time when they've been denied the freedom to earn the income needed to pay those bills. Those businesses are now going bankrupt, because the power of the government is being misused to force them into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>I can not spend my money at a business that no longer exists. Nobody can. If you really can't understand that, there is something profoundly wrong with you.</p>
<p>But then, I suppose that much was obvious, already.</p>

        <p>Imagine thinking that losing an argument would make you a victim of bullying, even if you really were a teen, "Crunchypac."</p>
<p>The only thing any of us can say for sure about you is that you're a troll, so when you tell me something about your personal background, I'm not about to take your word for it. You didn't even introduce that alleged fact about your life until just now, after you lost the argument, so it looks more than a little fishy. Like you made it up just to create a little drama, and divert attention from the fact that you had nothing intelligent to say.</p>
<p>At this point, I think I'll block you.</p>

        <p>That's still 6-7 fucking months away and it's sad to think we would be overjoyed if we were to hypothetically know shit would be back to normal by then.  But the funny thing?  My life wasn't that great to begin with.  But in contrast to this it sounds amazing.  Maybe perspective, I don't know, I have to resort to all the mental gymnastics now to keep myself from falling apart.</p>

She fled the USSR when it was falling apart and has seen calcified totalitarian states. We were talking about her childhood and how after 9/11 things just never went back to normal. Instead we got Homeland Security, we got the TSA, we got endless travel restrictions and stupid rules and massive waste and so much of that will never go away. </p>

Meaning that in those places in which the lockdown has been taken so far as to be the functional equivalent of placing the entire population under house arrest with limited furloughs, millions of innocent people will have served the equivalent of class one felony sentences just because some trolls on a few social networks decided to have some fun stirring the pot, and our governors decided that they could profit by going along with the hysteria whipped up by the trolls.</p>

<p>It is not how it had to be, and I now hold the people forcing this issue to be directly responsible for every death from neglected mental health, every missed diagnosis, every obstacle placed in front of regular care. I blame them for every business closure. Every tumbleweed of discarded, improperly used PPE that blows across Walmart's parking lot is their fault. I place every single moment of hopelessness and despair this has caused for any person in this world directly on their hands. If I am going to be blamed for spreading a virus, then I turn it around on them and they can take responsibility for ALL the things they have done and stop pretending this was inevitable and free. They bought their veneer of safety in human blood and tears and I hope one day they know how foolish and terrible they truly are.</p>

        <p>What no I was talking about Reddit Karma I got plenty to spare so keep the downvotes rolling? Yeah cases were still rising but that’s because no one took them seriously, people still don’t, and America decided to do protests and burn their own country down for fun, not to mention the nearly 1 million people who have died because of Covid and the millions who have gotten extremely sick because of people not doing what they are told, if people just kept to themselves inside for a month or two this would all be long gone, but people just had to sneak around and visit their friends and go out past curfew because their “rights” are more important than the safety of others, no where did I state that teenagers aren’t important me being one myself I think we are more important than anyone over 40, but at the same time I’d like to keep my mum and my grandma and the rest of my family, if like people to be able to see their grandkids get born, I’d like to see people get to know their newborn isn’t at risk of a deadly virus just because you couldn’t stay inside for a couple months, people need to shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down and do what they are told, stop just thinking about themselves and save lives. Stop putting words in my mouth you fucking degenerate I was just stating that suicides aren’t the only danger of Covid, I actually agree that schools should be open on the condition that social distancing measures are met, people mask up and sanitise, even if people can only go into school for a few days a week it’s important that they get that education and the socialising but adults have no fucking reason to be walking around with their masks hanging on their ears or their chins, adults are once again fucking everything up for the younger generations for their own selfish or just dumb reasons. So once again you can fuck right off with your bullshit cunt.</p>

        <p>Any virus like that is going to take <em>some</em> lives. Most of them will be elderly people, and most of those will have other conditions that weakened them to it before they even got infected. The point is that destroying the lives of billions of young, healthy people around the world was <em>never</em> necessary or in any way a good idea. I won't deny that lockdowns may have flattened the curve. But that doesn't mean there will be any fewer cases or deaths, just that they will be spread out over a longer time span. This would have made sense if the healthcare systems would have been truly overrun as we expected in the spring, but that never came close to happening and hospitals were laying off staff because they didn't have enough patients. We should have allowed COVID-19 to spike in a very short time, run it's course, and then gotten back to life as it was a year ago. This would have had very minimal effect on daily life for the vast majority of the workforce because the virus mostly affects older people who are no longer working anyway. This summer was effectively stolen by people in authority who wanted an excuse to abuse and grab more power. COVID-19 was just the trigger.</p>

        <p>No deaths are necessary.  But some are acceptable.  Life doesn't come without risks, and ultimately we accept some risks in exchange for the freedom to live.  It's tragic that some may die, but I'm not willing to sacrifice this entire country for the small chance that we could save a few people.  And I certainly won't stand on the graves of others to push the systematic removal of freedoms.</p>

        <p>I think it would be very disrespectful of me to reach out to the news or publicize his suicide in any way. I will leave that decision up to his family.</p>
<p>You know, now that I’m thinking about it, I never realized how disgusting it is when doomers use people who died from coronavirus whom they aren’t related to in order to try to advance their cause (like when they find a random 20 year old who died and publicize his death to a great extent to “warn others”). It’s really messed up to exploit others’ deaths like that unless their family gives explicit consent. Even if you think your cause is “the right cause,” it’s still gross. This definitely brings a new perspective to me.</p>

        <p>It's up to the families unfortunately, you would be surprised at the amount of suicides that are publicized as "accidents" because of shame/stigma surrounding suicides. </p>
<p>People think that suicide is a form of "weakness" or "selfish" act. Couldn't be further from the truth, when I was suicidal I truly believed that ending my own life would improve everyone else's lives, and my friends who are no longer with us shared the same feelings in their suicide notes.</p>

<p>Pretty sure one college acquaintances' sons  committed suicide a few weeks ago, perhaps aggravated due to the Covid lockdowns, because the obituary simply mentioned "the loss of our beloved on son on xx date." Gave no cause of death whatsoever.</p>
<p>I also have a friend whose son committed suicide directly related to Covid lockdown. He had continual years of mental health issues which were aggressively brought to a breaking point in lockdown. </p>
<p><strong>That is two people I know who died of suicide during Covid.</strong>
<strong>I know NO ONE who has died of Covid.</strong></p>
<p>It sure would be interesting to know how many people on this sub know someone who has died of suicide versus died of Covid.</p>

<p>Very few are dying "of" covid, most are dying "with" covid. The tests are bogus, most people will test positive whether or not they've had "covid". The inventor of PCR test explicitly stated it should not be used to diagnose infectious diseases. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd4De47ldYs</p>

        <p>I'm with you on feeling like ending my own life would improve everyone else's lives. I was also in such a dark place that I just didn't want to exist and was thinking to myself "even if they are sad, I'll be dead so I don't have to worry". It's truly a scary place to be inside your head and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia: Copycat Suicide
“The publicized suicide serves as a trigger, in the absence of protective factors, for the next suicide by a susceptible or suggestible person. This is referred to as suicide contagion.”</p>

        <p>The fucking doomers idiots “ahhh you think Rona isn’t reall!!!  Aaah!”   There have been 2 Rona deaths in my county since March.  2 people over age 80. Two octogenarians in 7 months.   So yeah.  Rona doesn’t exist in my world.   There are plenty of places like that just like OP says. No one in there died from Rona.  Covid is a big city problem that the rest of us are suffering for just like literally every other single problem in this country.  New York and LA have covid. Shut down the economy in the rest of the country where there are no covid deaths. NY and LA can’t stop shooting people.  So try to ban guns where there are no shootings.  In NY and LA there’s a homelessness epidemic.  Tax people where there aren’t homeless clogging the streets.  The cost of living is high in big cities. So fuck up the economy in places where it isn’t.  Obviously not just New York and LA.   It’s all big cities.   They have these rampant problems like shootings and covid because they pack people like rats into apartment buildings and subways and wonder why disease spreads.  We don’t do that in the small towns. But we have to pay for the shitty lifestyle choice of people who may as well be in a different country because their culture is so different from the rest of us.  Then they elect their shitty politicians to ruin shit for the rest of us. /rant.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry to hear that. Fuck this nonsense. The goal is to drive people crazy so that they do anything to get back to normal so they will have to take the rushed vaccine which will have god knows what in it to suite their agenda for control. Hearing this stuff makes me so angry at how the leaders of provinces/states who just listen to the prats above them have let people down so much by sucking all the fun and beauties of life away. I am starting uni tomorrow (obviously online for 4 months minimum because since early June my province has had ONE person die “after testing positive for” COVID19 and he was 91 years old) and all I want is to go on campus, meet people, party and enjoy life. This world has been turned to shit. Reading your post has made me so angry, if anyone else here is feeling down about this stuff (I do everyday) just remember, we ARE going to win this and the world will be better for it.</p>

        <p>This madness has gotta stop. I now am beginning to see these doomers say that even when we have treatments and vaccines available, we must do this bullshit. I say we need to revolt if that happens, I’m so sick of social distancing, masks, temperature checks, and lockdowns. We have to get our lives back, w/o any of the things I mentioned being crammed into our throats. Now thankfully, my state will probably lift all the restrictions fairly soon after we get stuff available to help treat and create immunity. Hopefully, by this time next year (at least in red states), we can get back to normal. Hiding our faces and being forced to isolate and have our activities restricted isn’t normal, and this new normal nonsense can fuck off.</p>

        <p>yes, this pandemic and the lack of social gathering has greatly impacted peoples mental health but lifting this lockdown will kill so many more people than suicide will kill. We need mental health systems and a friendly community, most people on this sub are the type to encourage anyone you dont like to kill yourself.</p>

        <p>What happened with your peer is terrible. That kid should not have died. </p>
<p>But it begs the question, Might it be that nobody died from covid where you are because of the mandates? Because we all wore our masks and distanced and washed our hands, we succeeded in our cause! That’s not doom, that’s success and should be praised! </p>
<p>how many people may have died due to exposure from kids with covid had we gone on with “business as usual”? I’m just wondering about weighing the options. It sounds like people are dying either way. Which one causes less deaths?</p>
<p>That being said, there definitely needs to be some mental health advocation in your highschool community. I feel we need protection from both problems, rather than neither. Maybe the solution is not to take off our masks and not think about about mental health  solutions. Maybe we need some guidelines for how to safely visit and hang out with friends and loved ones. That would help me immensely. </p>
<p>Im so sorry that you lost a peer. Many of my own family members have also taken their lives throughout my years, including my own mother. It hits hard. I hope we can find a way to help everyone through such a rough rough time in humanity.</p>

        <p>But all we've done is traded the lives of younger people for older people as Covid is only dangerous to over 65s mostly, sure it saved lives but how many were old people in care homes with little time left. It sounds cold but i'd rather keep the younger generation alive and well than keep 85 year old janice in the care home with dementia alive for 2 more years in isolation</p>
