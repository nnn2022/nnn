    <strong>Need advice about talking to parents about vaccination</strong>
    <p><p>Hello. I’m a 15 year old and a few days ago I got my 1st shot. I’ve been lurking on this sub a while, but still thought it was a good idea to get it. It was largely due to the fact of lots of social pressure and also I’m going through a mental rough patch (which largely came from lockdowns)</p>
<p>However, the day after, I almost immediately regretted getting the vaccine. I didn’t experience any side effects, but my instincts told me I did something wrong. I know I can’t go back and undo getting the first shot, but my gut tells me I shouldn’t get the 2nd shot. I want to discuss this with my parents, but I’m scared of bringing it up to them. Earlier today, my family brought up a story of a doctor recommending against the COVID vaccine who later died of COVID, and they all laughed and said it was karma. I’m also scared of not getting my second shot because I live in a very blue area where people were leaving school early the day the vaccine was approved and there is a lot of pressure to get it. </p>
<p>Does anyone here have any advice on what to do about not getting the 2nd shot and also about talking about it with my parents? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>Go ahead and DuckDuckGo “1976 Swine Flu 60 Minutes” and educate yourself. The government, CDC and celebrities have been used in the past for a vaccination that killed and crippled Americans with their knowledge of the risk it entailed, yet they covered it up, campaigned and released it anyhow.</p>

        <p>"Be true to your own act, and congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and extravagant, and broken the monotony of a decorous age. It was a high counsel that I once heard given to a young person, “Always do what you are afraid to do.“ - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
<p>The answer to your question is simple and terrifying. You must do what you fear most - don't take the second shot and tell your parents the truth - you are not going to do it because you are the one who decides what happens to your body. This is YOUR life. You are young but very wise and very courageous and you have the strength within you to stand in your own truth and call your own shots (pun intended.) I applaud you and want you to know that you are not alone. I live in a blue state as well and most of my family thinks I am crazy for not taking the vaccine. I know that at least in the near future some of my options will be limited if I don't take the vaccine but I am willing to suffer those consequences rather than submit to an authority that I believe is in the best case wrong-headed and in the worst case evil. Those of us who resist are like the Rebel Alliance in Star Wars. We are fighting an Empire based on fear and a dark addiction to power. We are scattered and silenced and ostracized and demonized, but we are fighting for freedom and we will prevail if we don't give into the spells of fear they are trying to cast upon us. You already know what you believe about this choice. You'll never regret being true to your own convictions. Stand strong, young friend. I have faith in you.</p>

        <p>Also, I am sorry your family would laugh about someone's death and call it karma. As you are well aware, this exposes that they are under the spell of fear and hate. This may be difficult to believe and even more difficult to resist doing, but you do not owe them an explanation about your choice. This is a trap they will set for you - asking you to defend your choice. You already said all you need to say -you just know in your gut that it's not right. You are going to have to be a rebel, an iconoclast, a maverick, a non-conformist. And that's a pretty cool thing to be.</p>

        <p>In delaware close to 70% got the first shot but only 30% of the state is fully vaccinated. Since the shot is now walk in and available everywhere the fact that half the people that got their first did not return for the second should tell you something. Your not alone and I've seen personally people get fucked up after the shot my mom's friend is in the hospital getting transfered to Hopkins tomorrow because beebee in Delaware can't figure out what's wrong with her</p>

        <p>You absolutely shouldn't do anything you believe is wrong for you. Forget about the second shot and try not to let yourself worry about getting the first one. We've all had various viruses and illnesses, and eaten foods with dyes and things that aren't healthy....try not to let yourself worry too much about having gotten the first one and just let it go. Focus on getting yourself into a better mental space, that is much more important. Also: it's no one's business. If you feel social pressure, you're under no obligation to say anything. Just let them talk and cheerfully agree. If asked directly and you want to answer, you got one! You were vaccinated. No one even needs that much, let alone more. I would be honest with your parents.</p>

        <p>I had the exact opposite experience: it felt great to get my first shot of Moderna sure I had to deal with the sore arm every vaccine gives you but that's better than COVID. My second shot was the same: sore arm for a day and nothing else. Highly recommend getting your second shot, don't listen to the BS on this sub it's BS, remember many of these people are the same god damn people who say vaccines give you autism</p>
