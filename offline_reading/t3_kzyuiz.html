    <strong>Germany: Tomorrow they'll tighten the lockdown against scientific evidence</strong>
    <p><p>Tomorrow there will be another 'Bund-LÃ¤nder-Konferenz'. First of all their is normally no legitimation by law for this group of people to decide, but our parliament decided to give all their power to this non-elected group of people within the conference. </p>
<p>Cases are declining here, ICU-occupancy decreased by \~15%, the 7-day-incidence is at around 130/100k (which seems perfectly fine for the height of the flu season), we never were on the verge of collapse when it comes to our hospital capacities. And still, it's somehow already decided, that they want to tighten the lockdown by introducing curfews and limited opening times of the already scarcely available shops. Of course, these measures don't make any freaking sense. On top of that, they always claim to stick to science while completely ignoring scientific studies and facts. A few days ago, a german journalist and activist against these lockdown measures asked the representatives at the federal press conference on which scientific studies and which data their measures are based. They couldn't give an answer to that and just said, that they were counselled by their 'experts'. They're restricting the freedom of 83 million people in this country and destroying our economy and therefore also the basis of the health care system. It's all a bad dream. </p>
<p>So many people are still supporting this, so I hope the conference tomorrow and the resulting tightened lockdown will open more people's eyes, because it will not be based on any evidence. </p>
<p>The measures have to be suitable, required and relatively. And they have to be checked everyday, if they're still one of these three. And what's the goal anyway? First, it was to flatten the curve, then to get under a specific R-value and now? We had all of this and they still locked us down. Our health minister is notoriously lying. In September he said 'With what we know today, we wouldn't close retail and small businesses anymore.' They're all liars and I don't understand how anyone can still trust these people. </p>
<p>If they're really going to tighten the lockdown tomorrow, it should be evident to everyone, that the goal is something different and we're perfectly in time for the scripted Great Reset.</p></p>

        <p>I feel you. I moved away from Germany years ago and can only shake my head at the level of brainwashedness of my friends over there. The "if only we had 100% compliance, this is all the fault of Querdenker and Nazis" attitude is alarmingly strong, nobody even stops to ask if anything of this makes sense.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's really sad. Those are the only people seeking to justify measures with scientific facts and are completely defamed and blamed. From the government we just hear, that 'they believe in the measures, because they believe in science'. This is not religion, folks</p>

        <p>I lived in Berlin for a long time and I miss it dearly. But I came back to Canada last year when the Covid stuff started.</p>
<p>Right now my city of 500000 has 40 Covid patients in the hospital and 140 total covid deaths with about 75% of them from senior's homes.</p>
<p>And we just went to full lockdown. No leaving the house except for essentials or exercising nearby. You cant meet with other people outside your household unless you live alone. All non-essential shops closed.</p>
<p>For 40 hospitalized out of 500000 people.</p>
<p>It's crazy. But at least in Germany there is resistance. Here in Canada we try too hard to be "not American" so the "Covid denial" is seen as a very "American" thing.</p>

        <p>Except, that we're still allowed to leave our house (let's see how it'll be tomorrow), everything non-essential is closed here aswell. I live in a city with close to 1.9mio inhabitants and there are currently a total of 92 Covid-patients in intensive care. We never had more than 120. Of those 92 only 77 are inhabitants of our city, the other patients are from other cities or countries.</p>

        <p>Practically, we can leave our house since we could "theoretically" be on our way to do something "essential". But the police can stop anyone and interrogate them and ask for some kind of "proof".</p>
<p>There has been a little protesting happening here in Toronto and Montreal. But unfortunately we are in Canadian winter and that means it's not very nice to stand outside. Plus, our cities are so far apart you just cant grab a cheap train to go to a nearby protest in the next bigger city. </p>
<p>It's so frustrating. This city has been destroyed. The entire downtown is out of business. Everything is boarded up like some kind of post apocalypse zombie film.</p>
