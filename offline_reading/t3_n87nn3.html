    <strong>My doctor knows masks are useless</strong>
    <p><p>I had a checkup a few days ago and when I got there he told me I could take my mask off (which I did) and that they don't stop a virus. Strange how a professional for treating diseases knows that masks are a waste, but people who don't know a thing about viruses scream when you don't wear one. There's so much propaganda about masks but the doctors that aren't feeding the lies know they're pointless. It's really unfortunate. He doesn't require anyone to wear masks in his building, so that was cool</p></p>

        <p>Not a Doctor but I know they are useless. By the way people handle it, take it off and on, put it in their pocket. The cloth masks they sell are for fashion use only. </p>
<p>So yeah doesn't take a doctor to figure that out.</p>

<p>There's not much speaking out they can do without compromising their careers. It's such a well designed system because if you remain anonymous, you're invalid, but if you come forward, you're finished.</p>
