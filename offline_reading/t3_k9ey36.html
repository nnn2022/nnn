    <strong>Here is why being "anti-lockdown" does not equal being selfish</strong>
    <p><p>From the beginning, the very beginning of this whole shit show I felt like something was wrong with the way it was panning out, the media coverage and, of course, with the response to it. For the past 9 months or so I have tried to keep myself as informed as possible and kept an eye on the numbers. </p>
<p>I live in a capital city, which I believe is one of the top 5 most populous cities in Europe (Bucharest) and I haven't had any friends, close friends, or relatives suffer from this virus. So all this time I was feeling angry because I believed we are being grossly manipulated and that there should have never even been a discussion which involved lockdowns. Not even a discussion. Not even those "2 weeks to flatten the curve".</p>
<p>Most recently, the father of one of my friends has gotten ill. It's almost definitely COVID and it seems like his father is having trouble fighting the illness. The first things that went through my mind were: "maybe I was wrong!" and: "maybe the lockdowns were the only solution". And then I realized that THINKING LIKE THIS IS SELFISH. Someone I know might suffer because of the virus and all of a sudden I feel like lockdowns and curfews and government ordered business closures are normal. This was the moment I realized that emotion should never be part of problem solving. </p>
<p>No matter how real of a threat the virus is, the response to it needs to be measured, proportionate to the threat, and it needs to take into consideration all of those involved and affected by the virus itself and by the measures taken to address the virus. </p>
<p>To sum this all up, if I were to die tomorrow directly from COVID, I would still want lockdowns to stop because of the suffering they cause which is being completely ignored.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed. I was willing to do lockdowns for at most 2 weeks out of a yearly period. We are now closing on 9 MONTHS of this lockdown bockdown tockdown nonsense.</p>
<p>When is it time to admit that lockdowns do not work? I think it was after the lockdowns were extended the first time and the case rate didn't go down.</p>
<p>Especially after we found out that the PCR tests being done were inaccurate above 30 cycles and most labs were doing them at 35-40.</p>

        <p>The lockdowns didn't work in the USA. In New Zealand, there are only a few COVID cases due to their strict lockdown cases while Freedomland is jsut "stay home if you want, i guess, just wash your hands if you feel like it."  If we want lockdowns to work, we need to actually do a lockdown.</p>

<p>Just because this is hell on earth for the economy doesn't mean you have to stop supporting small businesses.</p>

<p>What? All kids are either at home or at school. Please clarify.</p>
<p>&rt;mental health</p>
<p>The only one I agree with. COVID is hitting hard on our mental health, and lockdown is only rubbing salt into the wound. However, I feel that sacrificing my mental health for the greater good is a worthy sacrifice.</p>

        <p>If lockdowns do nothing to slow the spread which is what the data tells us, are you still happy to do so? Are you happy to do so knowing an entire country, Sweden, had very few enforced mandates yet has no unusual year on year excess deaths and no issues with overwhelmed hospitals, and less raw covid deaths per million than a lot of countries which enacted draconian measures?  Exactly the same in South Dakota, which has better mortality rates than California and New York yet zero restrictions?  Does it not make you angry that you have been sold a lie and forced to sacrifice a lot when it looks like it made no difference? Are you sure you're not just trying to protect your own ego because you have been deceived by a coercive, manipulative media in cahoots with a government which really doesn't care about you?</p>

        <p>Uh huh, the tiny proportion of us that are against this is why lockdowns don't work. I see. In that case, they will never work, because you can never have 100% compliance, so you are proving me right either way, your sacrifice was for nothing.</p>

        <p>You are missing the point. A better solution needed to be found so that people don't suffer as a result of governments "trying to contain the virus". The negative effects of the lockdowns have never been part of the discussion and were never taken into consideration. Governments and "experts" are acting as if the lockdowns were necessary and that they had no choice. Luckily, Sweden has proven to the world that lockdowns are NOT necessary. I know this will sound insensitive but a few thousand deaths in care homes are not the end of the world. A traumatized population is a lot worse. And they avoided that by simply following the pre 2020 book.</p>

        <p>I still don’t know anybody who has died FROM covid. But I know people who have died BECAUSE of covid. My friends mom decided to stop her medical treatments because she couldn’t handle what’s happening anymore. She wasn’t elderly or on her deathbed. Lockdowns are causing deaths too, to people who wouldn’t die by getting covid. The solution to the problem cannot be worse than the problem itself (or however the WHO said it).</p>
