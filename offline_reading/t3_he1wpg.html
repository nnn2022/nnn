        <p>It's so disgusting how people are becoming violent towards one another.  My mom was telling me about how my grandfather grabbed a kid by his shirt and threw him to the ground.  Why?  The kid didn't have a mask and reached over my grandfather to grab something.  My mom was talking about how inconsiderate the kid was because my grandfather is old... And I had to ask... What is the fucking logic of physically assaulting (thus touching and exposing yourself to a myriad of germs) someone for not wearing a mask?  We took a non issue and turned it into a safety situation where people are being physically beaten and the potential to come in contact with blood and other fluids is increased.</p>
<p>Seriously.  What the fuck.  Every life is sacred unless it's a non mask wearing defector?  God I feel so fucking bad for people who can't wear masks for health reasons.</p>

        <p>That’s what I don’t get — when de Blasio made the statement that cops will drag people who want to swim on beaches out of the water, I kept thinking like, “won’t that spread this illness more than they want to, instead of leaving them be in the ocean where they can’t infect anyone?” Mind you, I’m convinced the reason they’re forbidding swimming has more to do with not wanting to pay for lifeguards since the city has lost so much money.</p>

        <p>Not to mention that if de Blasio did carry through with having cops drag swimmers out of the water, the optics would look very bad, especially now post-George Floyd. There's no question this would be disproportionately enforced on minorities. And videos of children and teenagers being physically dragged out of the water by cops in the middle of the summer would just be bad publicity waiting to happen.  That's before the lawsuits contesting the validity of said orders and violations of people's civil rights. The city would be spending millions fighting lawsuits and paying out settlements.</p>

        <p>90% of citations and arrests for mask and social distancing violations were issued to black and Latino people in NYC. </p>
<p>Did you see the video I posted above of the subway incident in Brooklyn? It’s already happening. It’s been happening and it should be a surprise to no one what groups are paying the price for these bullshit enforcements of bullshit laws.</p>

        <p>It’s not just happening in Spain. Last month a young woman in Brooklyn NY was harassed, assaulted and arrested by police (all right in front of her young child) for failing to have her mask on properly before boarding the subway. </p>

        <p>That video is so important, thanks for posting it. Keep in mind that she had a mask on, but her nose was peeking out, that's what brought on the vicious assault.</p>
<p>Covid-nazis are heartless, dangerous bullies, totally devoid of human decency. They pretend to care so much about "grandma" that they can excuse any brutality and violence. They've managed to take power over most of the world and are rolling out a totalitarian police state that makes North Korea look like noobs.</p>

        <p>Right. That’s why I said “failing to have her mask on properly”. The most ridiculous thing about this arrest was that she WAS wearing a mask, it just wasn’t pulled up all the way around her nose the way they wanted it. She could have had asthma for all they knew. </p>
<p>I sent that video to a friend of mine who loves to argue with me that what we are experiencing is NOT a police state. She lives in NYC. No comment on this video. Lol. Of course not.</p>
