    <strong>Protestors against Covid Restrictions are received positively in every other country except the US</strong>
    <p><p>I could be talking out of my ass here since i'm using youtube for reference, but here me out.</p>
<p>If you can't figure out this is a make-trump-look-bad-and-china-look-good psyop by the dems and US based mega-corporations, go look at the comments of covid restriction protest taking place in America. The comments are all making fun of the protestors, with the typical responses such as</p>
<p>"George Carlin quote number infinity"</p>
<p>"The rest of the world is laughing at you" or some variation</p>
<p>"murica"</p>
<p>"natural selection" </p>
<p>and curiously no comment ever brings up the BLM riots.</p>
<p>However, go on a video of covid restriction protest for the UK or Germany, or Italy, almost all the comments are siding with the protestors and saying they're in the right, even on left leaning news channels. And you even have comments defending America.......... on videos of protest NOT IN THE US.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, big tech is gaslighting you into thinking that people fighting the new normal is a small minority of loud people that are to be mocked and ridiculed. This is not the case. They are deleting and banning comments to make it seem like we're stupid. And I wouldn't be surprised AT ALL if they were CCP paid shills or party members posing as regular people.</p>
<p>And with Reddit, we can safely say that the CCP have a stranglehold on this corpse of a website.</p>
<p>You are not alone, and you are not a minority. They are just making it seem like you are. DO NOT LET THEM DEMORALIZE YOU.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with your idea that the there is a far more powerful brainwashing mechanism in the USA than everywhere else. I happened to have lived in several countries during my life because my parents worked in diplomacy, so I have friends practically everywhere. I can definitely feel that the American ones are far more gullible to all the lies and mandates we are getting from the media and the government. People out of the US, only a very small percentage accept what the government tells them. </p>
<p>That being said, for me Trump and Biden are working for the same boss, but pretending that they fight each other over things that don't make any sense. I think they are both puppets, actors. Otherwise, how do you explain that Trump wants to mass vaccinate the USA when Bill Gates' vaccine is "ready"? That is what Trump's warp speed program is about, pushing the RNA Bill Gates vaccine to the public. He even said that he would make the US Army distribute it....</p>

        <p>Comments in Germany greatly deviate from the general public opinion as there are actually organised right wing groups commenting online.</p>
<p>There is a growing sentiment of doubt here, but its nowhere near the majority of people. The media did do a good job here in painting everyone questioning the status quo as either a conspiracy nut or a far right nazi. The left did use to be more questioning in march, but that completely changed following the media's smear campaign against anti-lockdown protests.</p>

        <p>What the hell. I live in Germany, and I've participated in several of the manifestations with most of my friends. There are people from all the ideologies in the marches. That thing about only "right wing groups" is a lie the media tells. Don't buy that crap. This is not a right vs. left circus-show, this is we the people against the dictatorship of the government. This is a fight for civil liberties.</p>

        <p>That's true, I'm talking about the heavily politicised online presence, on YouTube for example. That's not new, it was rightoid infested long before this march.</p>

        <p>Haha, no its not. At least there are states in the US that you can escape to. I can tell you in Canada its a country of conformists.</p>
<p>Don't look at just your own region. Look elsewhere. If you compare overall you'll see US is among the sane.</p>

        <p>Definitely agree on Canada, so many people I talk to agree masks and lockdowns are the wrong thing to do. But then I see virtually everyone walking around with masks on indoors or not. Embracing lockdowns and just saying they hope this ends soon, but cases are on the rise so we need to do our part.</p>

        <p>Part of it might be that the protests in the USA started back in May or so when people were still under the idea that coronavirus was deadly whereas these protests in other countries started much later when more people began to realize how weak the virus is and how overboard the response was.</p>

        <p>The US is always in the spotlight. The world loves it, but doesn't want to admit it. That's what you get from being a world superpower.</p>
<p>Nothing was more apparent than during the BLM insanity. Many countries completely unrelated(and completely homogeneous in terms of racial diversity), protested around the same time.</p>
<p>An article said Australians were more obsessed with US politics than their own.</p>

        <p>What was that quote about tearing down the Soviet infrastructure in the former USSR "territories"?  Ten seconds in Belarus, ten minutes in Latvia, ten days in Czechoslovakia, ten years in Poland?  Something like that (I probably have the countries wrong).  The more the Party hold was shaken before it left, the more its relics were tolerated.  Lockdowns in the US haven't been as bad as much of the rest of the world, and so the masses aren't as pissed.</p>

        <p>In western Australia here, we have one state that's got a few anti lockdown people and we all think there absolute fuck wits. And the whole country, even the ones unhappy about being in lockdown themselves, think America is the biggest lot of them. Save the crazy "Dems are brainwashing us" speech for the next time there's a trump rally lol. The state I'm in went hard lockdown almost immediately and was pretty much able to put a halt to it within 3 months, now we're almost completely lockdown free. The few restrictions we do have are common sense guidelines more than anything</p>

        <p>We’re not seeing as many restrictions in most states and sports are back on. We also have had riots but they have been veiled as anti racism protests.</p>

        <p>Bro Im from Germany and I can confirm that everyone is just making fun of those idiots, not only our satire shows on TV (e.g. heute-show), no even our main news like the „tagesschau“ make fun of them. Nobody stands with them, thats just bullshit Im sorry.</p>

        <p>The mainstream media says what the government wants them to say. And Heute-Show hasn't been objective in years, they never make fun of the political left, it's always right-wing jokes.</p>

        <p>Yep, can confirm for the UK as well. We think you’re all off your nut, and yes we do laugh at Americans like you, and if you get covid from your protests it’s definitely natural selection doing it’s part :)</p>
