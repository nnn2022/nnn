    <strong>Just realized.... I’m even more in disbelief..</strong>
    <p><p>So there’s roughly 328million people in the US, 7 million cases.. that’s only two percent of people are even GETTING “sick” what the f^{%. And it’s like .03 percent of THOSE are the “deaths”</p></p>

        <p>2 percent have tested positive.    The real number is much higher.   Meaning the virus is much less fatal than its being portrayed by the media.   Many of the fatalities are also death with covid rather than death from covid.</p>

        <p>And people will disagree that any more people in the US died of pneumonia in 2020 than an average year. </p>
<p>If people acknowledge that A LOT more people died of pneumonia than normally do, and were totally ok with it then that’s one thing.  But people are denying that it’s happening. People are saying it’s the same as any other year.</p>

        <p>I haven't been on Reddit long. I don't get the whole karma thing or why it matters. I don't pay attention to up votes of comments and always go read the downvoted ones. I replied how I feel to that comment just now. I had empathy at first, I'm a psychologist and empathy is something I have plenty of. My job would be easier if I didn't have empathy and just pretended, because clients suffering wouldn't hit me so deeply. I can't even step on an ant. </p>
<p>At this point though as I told my mum a couple of days ago, my empathy is at zero for them. For many, many reasons I could go into.</p>
<p>I also understand the psychology of it... but yeah I don't have empathy anymore for those who support policies that have done what they have.</p>
<p>Edit - just to say that my personal feelings are that I can't stand those who say the virus is fake. They make us look bad, and damage our arguments. I wouldn't want to silence them, the issue is that it's these people who the media tries to paint us all with.</p>

        <p>Well I can honestly say you have succeeded in silencing me. </p>
<p>I accept the lockdowns because of my sick mother who lives in a care home.  And in your comment on the other  thread you basically  told me that I am as bad as someone who let people be killed in the holocaust.  I’m not sure what kind of psychologist you are but you are most definitely capable of stepping on an ant because you just did.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry but lockdowns don't protect care home residents, as is well evident. The isolation of care home residents themselves is predictably causing their health to deteriorate leaving them more vulnerable to <em>any</em> infection and also killing them. The health effects of prolonged isolation are well known. </p>
<p>This is long but you should read it. Btw those who reported my Jewish relatives in hiding during the holocaust? They thought they were protecting themsleves and their loved ones also... </p>
<p>I had a great uncle in a care home during this. He was more of a father to me along with my grandpa, his brother in law, than my own father. We were extemely close. He was happy early this year despite dementia. He was doing well. He died following months of torture through isolation, isolation killed him but only after months of prolonged suffering. The virus did spread through his nursing home regardless, because lockdowns don't protect them. I <strong>wish</strong> he had been lucky enough early on and had been among the minority who die from the virus. He died following horrendous and prolonged suffering while you were at home believing harmful lockdowns were protecting the vulnerable, when they do not prevent the virus entering care homes and they do not protect the elderly. While you were easing your fears with the idea isolation wasn't a threat to those in care homes, when it's deadly.</p>
<p>My grandma sent me a photo of her brother and the state his body was in. He was a skeleton. Just skin and bones. So distressed his health deteriorated physically and mentally over those months and he eventually stopped eating. Better he had died from the virus. </p>
<p>My grandma herself had a heart attack early on and paramedics tried to refuse to take her to hospital because "virus". A cardiac arrest is far more deadly than a virus that has a small IFR even for those in her age group  - she's 91. Yeah protect my grandma by killing her right?</p>
<p>My closest friend's sister, also a good friend who I've known since I was 9, killed herself because of this. Her children are without a mother. She was happy and hopeful about her future and the start of this year after escaping domestic violence a couple of years ago </p>
<p>An 11 year old I knew when she was little ended her life here. She was 11 and I would rather my grandparents who I love dearly die over an 11 year old child with her whole life ahead of her. Guess what? They feel the same. My grandparents would rather die than someone young. I myself would choose to save a child over myself, and I'm still young myself but have lived more life.</p>
<p>Another friend attempted suicide but survived. My mum lost a friend to suicide because his family restaurant past down from his parents didn't survive this. </p>
<p>Then an old friend over in America has a 5 year old with cancer. She was going to start a clinical trial that was the best option and final chance, but it was cancelled for this virus hysteria. She's <strong>dying</strong> because people like you are so selfish you can't see the disproportionate harm done by lockdowns to everyone, and you support them out of blind fear. I hadn't spoken to her in a while, used to speak daily as teens, but had followed her daughter grow up. I messaged her and she is destroyed by this. <strong>This overreaction killed that little girl who unlike the average covid death had her entire life ahead of her</strong>.</p>
<p>A disabled friend in the UK who is entirely bedridden had her carer cancelled. Cancelled. Her carer who would come move her for bathing, place her in her wheelchair and take her to the living room and outdoors  to give her some sort of life. Who did all the basics she needs. Her mum cannot move her. She suffered for months in that bed, her mum unable to move her so unable to wash her sheets. She didn't get to bathe, her mum would only wipe her down with a cloth. She developed pressure ulcers and no doctor or nurse would come see her, they became severe, infection went to her blood before they treated her in hospital. </p>
<p>Not to mention all the harm done to people en masse in ways I won't go into because I've made this personal. All the terrible consequences that will lead to more deaths not just now but in years to come. outside of developed countries as a result of this choice you support. </p>
<p><strong>So no, I no longer have empathy for you because even if you were originally unaware of the horrendous disproportionate harm lockdowns would do it should be obvious now the harm has been done. You should also be aware by now that lockdowns don't protect care homes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This isn't protecting your mum, but it is harming everyone young to old more than the virus ever could and for years to come</strong></p>

        <p>Just a pro tip.  If you actually were a Registered Psychologist and not someone saying they were one on the Internet you would know what the word empathy actually means versus sympathy.  The way you keep using it is known as sympathy.  Empathy is simply the ability to understand someone else’s perspective.  It has zero to do with agreeing with that perspective or caring for the person in question. </p>
<p>Since you have said you are from Australia I feel safe in thinking you have a firm grasp on the English language.  So the fact that you don’t understand how to use the word empathy means you are  likely not actually a person that holds a graduate degree in the subject of Psychology. </p>
<p>A registered psychologist also wouldn’t have a pathological need to list the 11 days from Sunday why I’m wrong about my mom and her care home.  </p>
<p>Peace out Australian Psychologist!  May your clients value your amazing wisdom!</p>

        <p>I am actually a clinical psychologist. I know what empathy means versus sympathy, which by the way I have none of for you either. I have neither empathy of sympathy for anyone supporting this at this point because the harm is now obvious, so how anyone can support this by this point I cannot comprehend. I could emphasise at first, no longer. You are not the only ones with relatives at risk. I have several. I still can't understand your feelings, or even imagine them at this point, and can't out myself in your place even though I have family at risk of viral infections. I cannot see your perceptive or share your emotions on this. It's monstrous to support this and I don't know how you can.</p>
<p>I don't understand your perceptive when the disproportionate harm is clear including to those in care homes when it's obvious lockdowns don't protect them. I cannot put myself in your shoes at this point because I cannot imagine how you could continue feeling and supporting what you do, being willing to sacrifice all when your mum was at risk without covid. It is beyond my comprehension. I can't imagine how it feels to actually support this harm, and never will. I also cannot understand how it feels to be willing to catastrophically harm everyone because you're scared of a sick loved one dying. To be so willing to harm innocent others en masse including children despite lockdowns not protecting care homes. </p>
<p>I would sacrifice my mum (though not elderly) and would sacrifice my grandparents so as not to harm children and young people with their lives ahead them. they would sacrifice themselves. I would sacrifice myself. Except we <em>did</em> sacrifice the elderly during this but along with them we sacrificed the young. We didn't need to sacrifice either if we had followed how we had followed pandemics in the past, and we had actually protected care homes with represent a high percentage of the deaths despite being a tiny percentage of the population. </p>
<p>Empathy leads to compassion. I have none of that either for anyone supporting this by this point. It is predicated millions will die, mostly children, around the world from starvation alone due to these choices. I cannot emphasise with the support of harm, suffering, and causing death.</p>
<p>I don't have sympathy, and I have no empathy, and I don't have compassion for those who continue to be complicit in this harm.</p>

        <p>Well thanks for barfing all your anger out onto me. </p>
<p>I will keep that all in mind when I wear my mask to protect my sister.  Maybe she’s young enough to be worth worrying about in your mind?  Having survived being in a medically induced coma six years ago from an influenza virus while her son had his 2nd birthday?  Is that ok with you?  Probably not because I fit your profile of a deranged person who you ASSUME doesn’t care about any of the suffering caused by covid restrictions.   Since that time my sister has had a pacemaker installed because her heart is now failing.   So thanks.  But I’m well aware of what viruses can do to formerly young healthy mothers. </p>
<p>You don’t know anything about me or my family. </p>
<p>Get a grip.  So you aren’t in your professional space. You still told a complete stranger that they were as bad as people who let atrocities happen in the holocaust. Is this one of your finest moments?</p>
<p>Can we stop having this conversation now or do you want to dump more crap on me?</p>

        <p>Your sister is an outlier, though influenza is more of a risk for young people than covid. We can't destroy everyone because a minority may suffer harm from viruses. I suppose she hasn't seen your unmasked face since, considering any virus could do her further harm with her heart and she'll never see your face again? Also masks aren't effective and don't prevent viral transmission, you've fallen for the spin. We don't even use them here. </p>
<p>You are complicit in these atrocities by supporting them. Covid is here <em>forever</em> so it's about time you come to accept it's existence is something you will have to live with. You're free to wear a mask forever, if you wish, isolate, socially distance, not go out, not go to restaurants, pubs, clubs, festivals. Don't expect the world to stop because your family members will always be at risk of viral infections. The harm from these choices is greater than that of the virus and will last for years and years to come. My cousins with DS and heart problems have been on life support several times the past few years from viral infections. My mum has a damaged heart from when she was a child, like your sister a rare outcome of influenza. I was disabled by a virus as a child and it changed my life entirely. I still don't support this harm in the name of this virus, the IFR being calculated to now be around that of influenza worldwide...</p>
<p>Truth is your sister being harmed by influenza should give you perspective. The perspective to realise that we live with viruses and sometimes they can unfortunately harm us. It's no reason to destroy ourselves, or allow this harm.</p>

        <p>Ok, Australian Psychologist person. </p>
<p>You are now officially rambling to hear yourself speak.  Did I ever say I wanted this to go on forever?  Do I live in a place where people are actually locked in?  No I do not.  </p>
<p>Does my sister see my unmasked face.  Yes.  Actually we visit our mother together each week on Saturday  and we sometimes eat at a restaurant afterwards.   GASP.  Guess what?  You can’t actually eat with a mask on!  Also there was the time last Saturday where we tiedied up her daughter’s GRAVE.  I passed rocks to her and her face was right beside mine.  </p>
<p>Why the heck are you going off on me so hard?  What are you actually getting out of this really? </p>
<p>Again.  You don’t know me.  You have made all sorts of assumptions about me and are being an utter dick.  So for the love of god, go pick on someone else now. K?</p>

<p>They purposely mis portray this number as if it’s terrifying because there are so many people walking around “asymptomatically”.  What it tells anyone with a brain is that this number means that even if you do “catch” this, you will likely have no symptoms whatsoever.</p>

        <p>this asymptomatic shit, is a fancy way of saying 'not sick'</p>
<p>these pcr 'tests' are shit and can easily produce 'positive' results by ramping up the 'cycles' used in the lab, and it's not like a home preggo test, there is no +/- sign, each test must be 'interpreted'. </p>

        <p>Exactly right.  That weekend that the commie times came out with that article was the same weekend we had those explosive numbers from the CDC.  I figured that if anything were going to change people’s minds it would have been that.  </p>
<p>The cycling of these tests is the scams and you can guarantee that when the fake vaccine is ready they will turn those cycles way down to show less positive cases and claim that they fixed a non-existent problem.  Sort of like they did with the polio vaccine.</p>

<p>hawaii had a 1.2-1.3% 'postive rate from feb til the end of july, when they ramped up the cycles and overnight the rate quadrupled to 5-6%</p>

        <p>That is 2.8%.  Many experts  agree that the cases are much higher. Maybe 10x higher bringing the death rate percentage way down from 2.8%.  That is a very good thing.   </p>
<p>The longer it goes on, the better they are getting at treating it.  The people who got severely sick at the beginning had the worst chance at surviving because nobody yet know what worked to stop the body from over reacting and attacking itself.</p>
