        <p>OK. So you linked an article about the president of Tanzania sending in secret papaya samples to their labs because he suspects there's something wrong in the results. Well, let me tell you this; they're either not testing their samples at all, or they are lying. However; that does not mean that laboratories in the US, EU, or anywhere else for that matter have falsified results.</p>
<p>A PCR test cannot give a false positive on a papaya sample, unless SARS-CoV-2 particles were actually inside the papaya. It is extremely disingenuous to claim COVID-19 tests give positive results on any fruit.</p>
<p>I actually work at a company that manufactures these tests and if you have any questions, in good faith, I'd be happy to answer.</p>
<p>edit: as for goats; cats and dogs have been tested positive for COVID-19, so it's really not implausible that a goat could contract an infection as well. I however believe the simplest answer is that understaffed and low resource laboratories are not testing any samples at all. A swedish health care company falsified results for tens of thousands of tests, and got caught. What I'm saying is: it happens, but it's not nearly as far spread as some seem to believe</p>

        <p>5% is conservative and yes, 25% is certainly possible which is why testing healthy people was always a mistake. It dismisses seroprevelance and pushes false positives, as your cited study suggests.</p>
<p>With the testing numbers of my own state, given that the majority of tests were given to healthy college kids</p>
<p>5% of 2,838,766 is 141,938.3</p>
<p>with "77,122 " cases that falls well within the margin of error. iMy computer is going haywire, but I feel its important to ask, given recent changes to testing requirements to filter out the flu, and given the average age of death where I live is also the average life expectancy.... Is it all in fact a grotesque lie?  A global conspiracy? when the countries involved just happen to be in the "coalition of the willing" in Iraq, we must be able to debate whether or not this is all just fakery.? nto</p>

        <p>I question authority. It's not fun to review the evidence and conclude that there is a massively evil force that's using contagion to take away people's constitutional rights and liberty.</p>
<p>if you're working in the system and NOT questioning it, you're looking through the wrong end of the telescope.</p>
<p>The Nazis were very scientific. It is our obligation to ensure the witch doctors aren't slaughtering people. (cough) opioids (cough) lobotomys (cough) beta-blockers (cough) Thalidomide (cough) DES (cough) Vioxx</p>
<p>In the end- whether contagion is true or not- the pathogen is still nothing. People die from it due to poor health. Imagine if a fraction of the effort spent on testing would have been invested in housing or cleaning up pollution.</p>
<p>nope! all testing all vaccines all masks all profit</p>
<p>ours is a nonviolent movement- the contagion cult hinges on non consent and force.</p>

        <p>&rt;Your brother and Uncle sound like they are susceptible - not only tocorona but to everything. Your brother and Uncle also should not everwear a mask. Frail people in masks? It was grotesque and wrong.  Mask Induced Exhaustive Syndromeis a description of what happens to your body when all your functioningsystems are taxed by masks. Masks are another thing tho.</p>
<p><a href="https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/why-face-masks-are-critical-for-people-with-asthma-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/">there is no evidence that wearing a face mask can worsen your asthma.</a></p>
<p>\^The Finnish asthma alliance actually recommended using face covering for asthma patients during pollen season, WAY before COVID-19\^</p>
<p>Most "adverse effects" observed from wearing face masks are; itching, feeling uncomfortable, localized acne and / or rash as well as many other non-lethal and mostly niche side-effects. The study about MIES that you linked (thank you for that!) also states that is _only_ looked at negative effects, and after sifting through the findings your argument about not forcing vulnerable people to mask up is not holding water for the most part.</p>
<p>No health official would force you to wear one if it produces extreme uncomfortable skin conditions, heart-rate increases or other health hazards (which I fully admit is a real thing for a very, very small subset of people; hence, some people are exempt from wearing face masks).</p>
<p>But I don't even think people who are already compromised either with respiratory or pulmonary conditions should be forced to do anything, what I'm trying to say is that _healthy people_ should be wearing masks when appropriate and get vaccinated as soon as possible in order to protect those who _can't_ use a mask or get vaccinated. Masks don't necessarily protect the wearer, but they definitely protect surrounding people from breathing in aerosols or droplets.</p>

<p>NOW. What you said about children and COVID not being dangerous. Oh boy. That's a dangerous lie to be propagating...</p>
<p>(Ever heard of multi inflammatory syndrome in children? MIS-C)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fox26houston.com/news/texas-childrens-hospital-reports-increase-in-covid-19-hospitalizations-due-to-delta-variant">Texas childrens hospital</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.local10.com/news/local/2021/07/30/south-florida-childrens-hospitals-report-uptick-in-covid-19-cases-among-children/">Florida sees uptick in children hospitalized with COVID</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMe2023158">More on MIS-C</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/07/210716112443.htm">Although the risk of a child being admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is small, a new UK study has found that around 1 in 20 of children hospitalized with COVID-19 develop brain or nerve complications linked to the viral infection.</a></p>
<p>Now please, tell me how MIS-C or brain/nerve damage for children, or being put on a ventilator as a young young child, isolated from other people is _better_ than having to put on your big boy pants and MASK UP?</p>
<p>Well over 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered globally already, 343 million doses in the US alone.</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html">Reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination are rare.</a>More than 342 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered inthe United States from December 14, 2020, through July 26, 2021. Duringthis time, VAERS received 6,340 reports of death (0.0019%) among peoplewho received a COVID-19 vaccine. FDA requires healthcare providers toreport any death after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’sunclear whether the vaccine was the cause.</p>
<p>0,0019%. That's the "death rate". Which is of course is not, because you could die from constipation the week after your vaccine and it will still be reported in these statistics because we cannot say with 100% certainty that the vaccine had nothing to do with it, but saying that it definitely did is irresponsible and misleading.</p>
<p>Weird how 70% of Finlands population hasn't had serious complications due to the vaccine yet.... Hmmmmm...</p>
<p>Meanwhile I'm making an appointment to get my 2nd shot earlier :D</p>
<p>(BTW. Anecdotal evidense here regarding your last sentence; I was a couple hours away from dying as a child due to an enterovirus infection (same virus family as Polio, fyi, so children DO die from respiratory viruses, and many develop latent infections which flare up, attacking your CNS and causing meningitis, encephalitis and myocardial infections later on).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These vaccines undergo seriously rigorous testing and are made absolutely sure to be safe for the general public, any special case should be handles on a case-by-case basis, but saying vaccines are dangerous, especially compared to what COVID can do, is utterly ridiculous.</p>

<p>Covid restrictions have led an additional 118 million people to fall into hunger. 1 in 5 children will be stunted due to malnutrition. You're freaking out about a near infinitesimal risk to children while ignoring a massive man made humanitarian crisis. 
You want to blow hard about kawasaki disease call George W Bush. he's really worried about women's rights in Afghanistan too. That's why he had to begin a war that has killed over 100,000 civilians.
Like I said, wrong end of the telescope buddy.</p>

<p>118 <strong>additional</strong> people faced hunger in 2020 rather than in 2019.</p>
<p>No, masks and vaccinations don't cause malnutrition. But <strong>Gangsters</strong> in a Massive Global Cabal that require certain face ornaments and papers in order to travel or earn a living: <strong>they do</strong>.</p>

        <p>I'm not a doctor. I don't work for doctors.</p>
<p>I develop and research molecular diagnostics tests specifically for stool parasite infections, antibiotic resistant bacteria infections, bacterial gastroentitis infections and as of 2018 respiratory pathogen infections (think enterovirus, influenza A/B, RSV A/B, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Adenovirus, Human coronavirus NL62, HCOV OC43, HCOV 299E) and yes; SARS-CoV-2 as well!</p>
<p>Just because you don't understand a single thing about RT-PCR tests, how the data is analyzed and how INSANELY STRICT quality controls are in this field does not mean it's witchery. But if you're resorting to calling scientists witchdoctors I don't think you even want to understand the very basics of SARS-CoV-2 or any other potentially lethal respiratory virus for that matter.</p>
<p>You should be happy that the research and development I and all of my colleacolleagues are doing is to the benefit of you no matter what kind of 10 year-old logic you use to rationnalize your misguided beliefs.</p>
<p>I doubt you even really understand what Ct is, and eve if you do; the tests I work with do not only use RT-qPCR but also a DNA microarray to ensure the result is correct. But feel free to lecture me on how many "Cts I should run my .. machine..? up to". You are truly clueless :DDDD "Running up Cts" oh christ.</p>

<p>...in other words NOT isolated.</p>

        <p>Interested to hear more.  </p>
<p>Can you elaborate on what you mean with the cytopathicity tests?  </p>
<p>Also, how do you know it is the causitive factor in the disease? By what procedure is that determined?</p>
