    <strong>At what point do you say "enough is enough"?</strong>
    <p><p>I have taken their controlled demolition as politely as I can. I have sucked it up and worn a (NATO NBC gas) mask. I have made not a single peep about being on house arrest for five months. I have watched from the sidelines as the equities get hoarded at the expense of small business.</p>
<p>I have been a very patient man.</p>
<p>If they try to stick me with a Bill Gates vaccine, I will kill them. (You can ban me from the sub. Ban me from reddit. Red flag me all you please. I want to go on the record.) If you make any attempt to put me in a line to get a vaccine from a war criminal, I will kill you. You might kill me in the process, but I will not go peacefully. </p>
<p>What's your red-line, reddit?</p></p>
