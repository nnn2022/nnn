    <strong>You know, it's crazy how many "conspiracy theories" regarding Covid have been proven true or at least been discussed as possibilities</strong>
    <p><p>There's been so many things about Covid that were once deemed as "conspiracy theories" that have been proven true or at least discussed as possibilities. Some examples include:</p>
<p>Vaccine passports</p>
<p>Vaccine shedding (Pfizer said its a possibility)</p>
<p>Vaccine bribery</p>
<p>Vaccine dangers (though the media like to keep quiet about this, it's all but confirmed now that the vaccine is dangerous, being more detrimental to children's health than Covid itself)</p>
<p>People going door-to-door to try and get people to take the vaccine (Biden just announced this one)</p>
<p>Lab leak (it has recently been discussed that Covid could have been intentionally released)</p>
<p>New strain hysteria (they use new strains to promote more fear, like we've seen recently with the Delta, Delta Plus, Lambda and Epsilon variants)</p>
<p>Mask ineffectivity (Some studies have shown that masks don't work, which could be partly why some places have been loosening or outright removing mask mandates as of lately)</p>
<p>These are just the ones off the top of my head. I'm sure there's more.</p>
<p>Yet they call us "crazy conspiracy theorists". I'm not saying all conspiracy theories are necessarily true, but when there's been all these conspiracy theories about Covid coming true, something is going on.</p>
<p>How many of the things above once deemed "conspiracy theories" have you guy personally called?</p></p>

        <p>In fairness, most of them didnâ€™t take a genius to figure out. Lab leak was the most frighteningly obvious one.</p>

        <p>I have been searching for this. I hope folks will finally listen to me. Iâ€™m 31F. For my whole life Iâ€™ve had regular 28 day periods no issues</p>
<p>After staying with my bf parents post their vaccine I had 3 periods in 2 months</p>
<p>After spending more time with them I developed an ovarian cyst that ruptured for the first time in my life</p>
<p>It happened a second time a month later while I was staying at their house</p>
<p>It happened a third time after staying with my dad post his vaccine, spent a 2 hour car ride with him to a hiking spot- half way up the mountain it ruptured</p>
<p>Maybe this is all coincidence .. I have not gotten the vaccine.. But this has been the weirdest 6 months of my life and maybe coincidence it lined up with me spending time around vaccinated folks idk</p>

        <p>I'm afraid to say it's not a coincidence. Spike proteins from the vaccine are likely being shed onto you. Thousands of other women report similar issues. To anyone who thinks vaccine shedding isn't real, are you going to tell me that thousands of women are just starting to coincidentally have menstrual issues after being around vaccinated people?</p>

        <p>Thank you. It seems to be too much to be a coincidence. His sister is coming to stay with use for 4 days (non negotiable so far) and Iâ€™m not sure how to really protect myself from this- I cannot stress enough how painful ruptured ovarian cysts are- and furthermore I worry about my fertility as I havenâ€™t had kids yet</p>
