<title>This is Tokyo right now. Lots of people, some are wearing masks, some aren’t. No mandates, most importantly. This is basically what I saw when I was there in June 2019. So happy to see this.</title>

        <p>But I was told that Japanese people are born with masks attached to their face and it never comes off and that's why they are superior to Americans.</p>

        <p>I know you're joking but it seems there are some people that genuinely believe Japanese people wear masks in public all the time. They only do it when they're sick and only because they can't get off work.</p>
<p>If covid doomers want that kind of work culture, where you can't call in sick unless you're bedridden, and you have to come in, so you wear a mask and suffer through it, they're in for a rude awakening once their work from home period ends.</p>

        <p>It’s more common in Japan to wear a mask, even prior to this madness. But it’s never been mandatory, which is why it doesn’t bother me. It was a little weird to see even in 2019, and I’m guessing more people choose to wear them now, but it can’t be compared with the mask mandates in Europe and the US, cause here it’s seen as the universal cure for covid and if you don’t wear it you’re actively killing people, at least that’s what a lot of people seem to believe. In Japan it’s simply a question of courtesy, which is such a huge part of their culture.</p>

        <p>I live here and for now, things are almost normal besides 99% of people in mask, social distancing stickers all over, temperature checks in some stores and parks and plexiglass dividers all over. <br>
But they are claiming more cases and I have a feeling they’ll lock us down soon. They are also promoting the vaccine daily in the media. I just hope Japanese rise up and fight against it.</p>
