    <strong>DAMNING SNOWBALL II. Comment sources and a key takeaway.</strong>
    <p><p>Continuation of DAMNING SNOWBALL I. Here's how it works: comment sources along with a key takeaway from that source. After a few days I will take the best of them and compile and categorize them and release DAMNING SNOWBALL III, with the sources from this thread in the body... and so on in each thread. The idea is to get our shit together.</p>
<p>Sources can be about anything No New Normal, science and stats will have a higher bar to meet - unless you are purposefully pointing out junk from the Branch Covidians.</p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
<p>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html</p>
<p>&rt; "In Massachusetts, from 85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle threshold of 40 would have been deemed negative if the threshold were 30 cycles" </p>
<p><strong>Breakthrough Cases</strong> </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf</p>
<p>&rt; CDC will only investigate breakthrough cases that have a cycle threshold of &lt;= 28</p>
<p><strong>Vaccines</strong></p>
<p>https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/faqs#vaccine</p>
<p>&rt; Any adverse reaction to a vaccine is an OSHA recordable incident if it is a condition of employment.</p>
<p><strong>The Fourth Estate</strong></p>
<p>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28110/w28110.pdf</p>
<p>&rt; U.S. major media readers strongly prefer negative stories about COVID-19, and negative stories in general.</p></p>

<p>I had a cat named Snowball.</p>
<pre><code>    She died, she died.

<p>Mom said she was sleeping.</p>
<pre><code>   She lied, she lied.

<p>Why oh why is my cat dead?</p>
<pre><code>  Couldnâ€™t that Chrysler have hit me instead?
