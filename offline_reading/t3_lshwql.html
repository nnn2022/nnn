    <strong>It's time for doomers to realize it doesn't work here.</strong>
    <p><p>You coming here with all the mainstream nonsense is a bad idea to convince someone to <em>REJECT THE EVIDENCE OF THEIR EYES AND EARS</em></p>
<p>We never told anyone to go fuck himself. We never told anyone to die. We never told that anyone "should be executed publicly in front of their family to prove the seriousness of this pandemic" (it's not that it's just because a doomer wrote it, but honestly that is one of the scariest things I've ever read).</p>
<p>So what are we doing here? Is it possible to be considered as a community full of hate speech if the biggest insult here is being downvoted? Yes it is. Is it possible to be considered a hero even when spreading misinformation? Of course.</p>
<p>What you don't realize is that you have no freedom, and you never actually did, even before this. The authorities that make you wet your pants... It's not that they only have freedom, they have power. You don't have neither freedom nor power anymore. And it's a fact that should make you think about priorities in life.</p>
<p>You are being abused and humiliated. Your rights and freedoms are being taken away right before your very eyes while you are convinced that you should give your freedom away in order to have it back. </p>
<p>Well, it's time to admit to yourself, it doesn't work that way.
 "It makes no sense", "What have we been thinking", "How did this happen", "How come we have two sides when it comes to science? Shouldn't science be based on facts that everyone agrees upon?", "Isn't it strange how they reopen everything during a pandemic still going on?", "Dancing nurses?", "Why do they put dolls in hospital beds?" and so on... The list is too long I haven't even scratched the surface. </p>
<p>So, time to get back to the point: YOUR FEAR MONGERING PROPAGANDA DOES NOT WORK HERE. </p>
<p>Your "kill yourself" and "I hope you die" or even "You bioterrorists! " is so contradicting that it makes us cringe.
 Even then, we are willing to help. This is not an echo chamber, this is not a community that promotes hate speech. This is a community where censorship does not exist, where you are allowed to have different opinions and don't get perma banned. Actually you don't find much places like that on the internet anymore, right? </p>
<p>If anyone of you really cared about life at all, or about the lives of others, you would suggest your family members or you should convince your neighbor to stop smoking. You should make it clear that McDonald's is not healthy and that overweight girl should eat more fruits and vegetables. If you really cared about life AT ALL you would stop destroying nature and you would suggest to stop that damn deforestation. YOU WOULD START A TREND TO DONATE TO THE STARVING KIDS IN AFRICA, BECAUSE MILLIONS OF THEM DIE OF HUNGER YEAR BY YEAR, BUT YOU ARE STILL SMOKING, YOU ARE STILL THROWING AWAY FOOD, YOU ARE STILL SPILLING WATER, YOU ARE STILL SPENDING MONEY SUPPORTING YOUR FAVORITE DAMN YOUTUBERS, YOU ARE STILL BUYING THE DAMN DRUGS BECAUSE DEEP DOWN YOU KNOW THIS DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY, AND YOU HIT THAT JOINT JUST TO FEEL SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU REALIZE WHATEVER YOU DO YOU WILL NEVER ESCAPE THIS DEPRESSION. </p>
<p>But, wear a mask, they said it would save the world. </p>
<p>I mean, 
Just think independently, <em>it's not that hard</em> .</p></p>

        <p>Damn that was good! But I would suggest more than one mask lol I believe that’s the update now, as many masks as possible and the more difficult it is to breath the better for the wearers protection right? Lmfao jebus! </p>
<p>On a serious note, we just held a protest in our small town to help people wake up, and it really just pissed people off, anyone have other suggestions to help their communities to wake up?
Cheers!!</p>

<p>I live in the most NWO compliant area in the country, or one of them.</p>
<p>Everyone wears masks on hiking trails around here. I simply did not and one older woman walking alone saw me breathing the fresh air and took hers off.</p>
