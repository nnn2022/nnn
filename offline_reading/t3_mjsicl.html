    <strong>I probably have no choice other than getting vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>You'll see from my comments history that I am one of your own. Just been away to switch off from all this.</p>
<p>I am Indian, been living in the UK for many years. I still have strong ties with India, with my parents, my siblings, most of my cousins, in-laws and most of my wife's family still in India. Normally we'd visit India at least once, sometimes twice a year, but we haven't visited ever since this covid melodrama broke out, simply because we didn't want to go there and get stranded.</p>
<p>I will be asked by NHS to come and take the jab any day now. I have no desire to do that because I know that whatever else it may be, it's no vaccine, but I also know that my life will be made increasingly difficult when I refuse.</p>
<p>Which is fine, but I'm 100% certain that starting next year, I'd be stopped at airports if I am not vaccinated, and not allowed to fly anywhere.</p>
<p>That's something I cannot handle. My parents are old. I cannot be in a situation where I am not allowed to fly.</p>
<p>I also thought of refusing the vaccine for now, and only take it when they make it mandatory for international travel. But that would be a short-term solution and I'd just be delaying the inevitable.</p>
<p>Is there anyone else on this sub in a similar situation?</p></p>
