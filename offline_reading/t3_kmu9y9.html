    <strong>I don't fucking get it. I really don't.</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a locked down county in the US and before it was locked down, I loved my town. There was always something going on, things to do, people to meet. Now that it has been locked down, with restaurants closed for indoor AND outdoor dining, and a town full of brainwashed citizens, I am finding it hard to justify why I like it here.</p>
<p>We have to travel to a nearby county to do <em>anything</em> remotely normal. Today we went on a walk through an ecological reserve and had lunch outdoors at a fantastic Hawaiian place. There were maybe 30% of people wearing masks outdoors on that walk. But where I am, 80% of people wear a mask outside, and you get harassed if you're not or you get really fucking dirty looks. </p>
<p>I am writing this because I am so god damn frustrated trying to find a fucking hair dresser because they've been shut down. Please tell me: How is having a one-on-one appointment with a hairdresser inside <em>LESS SAFE</em> than going shopping in a crowded Costco or Walmart? Please explain to me, because I don't get it. I really don't. And you cant fucking convince me it is contributing to COVID statistics. Because it is not, and your fear is made up, so fuck you.</p>
<p>I could vent for hours, and thanks to the scamdemic, I have plenty of free time to do so. But I wont because I know you guys on this subreddit also feel the same way. This is the only sanity I get on a daily basis. So thanks for that.</p></p>
