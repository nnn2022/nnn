        <p>I agree. People think it means you're a republican but it's just means you see things for what they actually are and you are not blindly believing what you are being told  anymore. It was so painful when I took it. I wished I could go back to being asleep about everything. It's an easier life. When I disagree with people who are where I used to be and they immediately default to calling me a trump supporter or a murderer or a racist, the usual things that they call people who disagree with them... I always think to myself I wish I lived in your world where things were this easy and you put people in Little Boxes like this to make yourself more comfortable. It never occurs to them that you could be thinking like this and not wearing a Maga hat and going to a Klan rally. Especially when it involves things that aren't even political, they need to politicize everything to make sense of it.</p>
<p>I'm kind of at the blackpill stage right now. Working on the white pill and not sure if I'm going to get there.</p>

        <p>It's hard to accept that the world has changed like it has. I live in Santa Cruz California and 99% of everybody here are like the sheep in Animal Farm. It's so sad. I came here to study music and surf but I won't be able to continue at my college without the vaccination. I don't want to leave but I think I'm going to have to. I've lived all over the country and I love New England so I might head back there but I imagine that the mindset there isn't much different. I lived in Athens Georgia for a while and I loved it but it was too far from the coast. Texas is too landlocked for me also and I've never been to Florida and imagine it's too hot and muggy even with the ocean. I just want a peaceful cabin in the woods near a surfable beach and neighbors who are not too close but good self-reliant freedom-loving people. I'm an artist and I wouldn't mind living in an artist community as long as everybody respected each other. I want to live in a world without fear and hate. Is that too much to ask?</p>

        <p>I could have written a lot of what you said! I totally agree! I am so deeply disappointed in New York City. I really thought people here thought for themselves far more than they do. I love the Northeast, I was born here and I really don't want to live any place else. I really enjoy cold weather and mountains and I like having access to the ocean as well. I like the East Coast I like the climate. I think out of all the states in this section of the country New Hampshire is probably someplace where I would go. Vermont is a total loss, Massachusetts is awful and Maine really isn't much better. Out of all the states in the surrounding area I think New Hampshire is probably the best bet to be around freedom-loving people. It's also beautiful. I grew up in the Adirondack Mountains in Upstate New York and that's truly where my heart is. It is gorgeous and I feel happy and peaceful when I'm there. The people are really nice too. I just love it. The problem is New York City drags the entire State down. Every place outside of New York City has far more normal mentally healthy people. But the population density of New York affects who we end up with in charge of our government. New York City controls the entire State. It's terrible. But the Adirondack Mountains Upstate are really where I would live if I could choose any place. Honestly local government means a lot more than federal and state. If you live someplace where you have a really good Sheriff your life is going to be much better.</p>

        <p>I lived in Boston, Burlington and Portland, Maine while I was traveling and indie touring. Yeah, New Hampshire is nice. I love the cold weather and snow too. I can surf the mountains in the winter. OK now I have a plan, thank you. I'm serious! I've been agonizing about what to do. All I need is a plan and I'm good. Hey maybe we'll even meet up IRL, I can tell that we are gonna be friends :) https://youtu.be/PKfD8d3XJok</p>
