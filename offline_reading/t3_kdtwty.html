        <p>This right here should show everyone how none of this is based on actual evidence and science, if anyone had any doubts before this (looking at you doomers). NY bans indoor dining even though it accounts for only 1.43% of infections that they’ve traced, and they’re threatening a full shutdown even though they show 74% of cases coming from in home gatherings. Some places have restaurants closed because they’re the big issue, but gyms open. Some have gyms closed and restaurants open. Some have both closed, and then some have both open. </p>
<p>If there was conclusive evidence to show one activity was responsible for a huge amount of cases we’d inevitably see nearly every state (at least blue) close that and leave the low risk ones open. Instead it’s a big hodge-podge of restrictions. They don’t care about anything other than looking like they’re doing <em>something</em> so they get approval points from the seeming majority.  </p>
<p>Fact is it doesn’t matter where cases come from, nothing justifies this. And even if it did, most cases are coming from gatherings at home so yes makes perfect sense to close public places and force people to spend more time at home. There’s no way to logic your way out of this because it’s not based in logic whatsoever. People who support this crap are insane.</p>
