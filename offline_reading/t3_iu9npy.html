    <strong>My Mom is a Football Doomer. And I Can't Take This</strong>
    <p><p>So the Big Ten is coming back to football this Fall, and I'm happy about it even though it will be awkward with masks and little/no fans in the stadium.</p>
<p>However, when my mom brought it with me, she was mad. She says that "money always prevails" and she doesn't want "people to die or get long-lasting effects of COVID"</p>
<p>This is the most angry I have been since CA shut down again in July. I told her that we need some form of life to go on, and we can't only have the media's fearmongering and the Trump and Biden show. I also told her that if the NFL can manage this, so can the NCAA. Most Importantly, these are 18-22 year-olds who are more likely to get CTE, Concussions, and torn ACLS than get very sick or die from this thing. Lastly, I said that we need distractions in our lives, but she is all "AHHH Long-term Effects and Death".</p>
<p>I just don't know what to say anymore. I actually very upset at this line of thinking, and don't know what to say back, since no one in my life knows I'm a "lockdown-skeptic".</p></p>

        <p>I hate when they say there are long term effects. How do they know that when they've only been studying this "virus" for only 6 months. My dad said the same shit the other day, but before I could make that point my step mom said something else and slightly changed the direction of the conversation. 
If they see that say 10, 15 years down the road, ok but 6 months? There's no way to know that at this point. Fucking insane.</p>

<p>That alone is probably making it a lot harder. Is there anyone in your life you can trust enough to share your feelings about this? I'd be going crazy if I wasn't talking about it.</p>

        <p>Sadly no. I live in CA (LA), and everyone I know is acting as if it's still March.</p>
