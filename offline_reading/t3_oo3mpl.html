<li>Only know of an 89 y/o grandfather of a colleague of mine who died while testing positive of COVID-19 but was already in and out of hospitals before the pandemic. I have a large group of colleagues, friends and quite an extensive family. </li>
<li>Last summer everything was sort of allowed without vaccines or PCR tests. At this stage COVID-19 was relatively unknown. Draconic measures would have made more sense last year, yet they came this year.</li>
<li>There is no scientific base for curfews or lockdowns, yet they were imposed. This came to light after they were imposed, but they will be imposed again.</li>
<li>Many top scientists and doctors have been censored/blacklisted. This would not never happen in a normal democracy. </li>
<li>Many draconic laws have been passed, for temporary use. But they are still there.</li>
<li>The contracts for the tracking and registration apps were already signed in 2018 by the EU member states. </li>
<li>3 Presidents of countries opposing vaccines died. Could be a coincidence but reading about the many South-American leaders dying in the cold war, I don't believe so.</li>
<li>The amount of bots on Twitter, Reddit and Facebook grew exponentially since the start of the scamdemic.</li>
<li>The fear mongering propaganda is everywhere, all the time. Whether you turn on the radio or TV it's non-stop covid covid covid.</li>
<li>Like you I also work in QA and I know a thing or two about testing. The way the test conditions are manipulated (cycles) in order to get the desired results is just scandalous. Also the quick-test had a chance of 25% on false negatives, where the PCR has a chance on false positives. These are not proper test tools and they are the foundation of many restrictions.</li>

        <p>I have political objections, ethical objections, spiritual objections, legal objections, and medical objections. </p>
<p>1) The two-year SOL (statute of limitations) through the CICP is laughable and most petitioners are refused compensation. Furthermore, no manufacturer, government agency, doctor, institution, service, or school can be held liable for any adverse affects. Which means... </p>
<p>2) My body, my choice. Just like each of the vaccine fact sheets for shots with EUA state: it is my choice to take the vaccine. Any attempt to coerce my actions by threatening my job or access to services will be viewed as impinging my Constitutional rights and need not be tolerated.</p>
<p>3) There were still extensive safety and efficacy concerns for in vivo mRNA treatments mere months before the first covid case. All the peer-reviewed medical journals leading up to the pandemic showed the technology was promising, but there were still major hurdles to overcome before any formulation could be ready to use. I've been looking for (and haven't found) any indication that the manufacturers addressed the known concerns in any of the studies. They just claim it was "test to use."</p>
<p>4) Key segments of the population were not considered in trials, including pregnant women, children, and people who already survived the virus. The last is particularly important because one of the known concerns for <em>in vivo</em> and LNP mRNA vaccines is cytocine storms and issues with immogenicity, inflammation, and disrupting the body's immune response when re-exposed to the disease being treated for (among many others). </p>
<p>5) The two previous attempts at prophylactic mRNA vaccines, for rabies and for Crigler-Najjar both failed. Both were pulled from clinical experiments for having too many adverse effects. </p>
<p>6) The historic legal precedence for mandating any vaccine or medical treatment has cited the extensive testing done by the FDA approval process as the justification for allowing said mandate. Without FDA approval, there is no other legal precedent other than police force. </p>
<p>7) Part of the reason the vaccines are considered safe is because the formulation is supposed to stay in the arm muscle. If the spike proteins are being replicated in any essential organs, reproductive organs, or cross the brain barrier, then the technology enters into territory that scientists have long cited as a problem of mRNA technology. The Japanese autopsy report showed the proteins in all the man's primary organs, which is disconcerting and contradicts the narrative and should halt progress until further safety research is completed. </p>
<p>8) The vaccines are based on the premise that the spike protein is harmless. The literature supporting this is sparse and unclear, but more and more evidence is coming out to show that the spike protein itself might be dangerous to the body. </p>
<p>9) Death comes for us all and dying is a natural part of life. The virus mostly affected old, sick, or unhealthy people. These populations also seem to see the most benefit from the vaccine and seem to have fewer reported side effects (that I've read about). Conversely, most accounts of extreme side effects I've seen have been in young and/or healthy people. This places more risk on healthy members of society, and threatens to degrade the overall health of any nation. </p>
<p>10) Statistically speaking, a large enough data set presented in a graph will present in a bell curve, with the most common factors in the median and a diminishing arc on either end of the bell. Since most people have mild to moderate effects, we can safely assume that one end of people will have no effects. This means the other end are the people who have extreme effects. Since Phase 3 trials are not complete, we don't have much known about WHICH members of the population are negatively affected, nor WHY. Without long-term studies, every participant is hoping they don't have something in their genetic makeup that will trigger one of the many known negative reactions. The unknowns of it all make it a bigger personal risk for me than contacting a disease I've already survived. </p>
<p>Bonus reasons:</p>
<p>11) I'm religious about caring for my body and being in control of what I consume. I practice yoga and exercise regularly, and pay extra for organic and non-GMO foods to avoid chemically altered substances as much as possible. I refuse to take hormonal birth control or flu shots because of my beliefs, so definitely not going to take new medical treatments cooked up in a lab. </p>
<p>12) I already survived covid at the height of virulence, and given the lack of evidence to demonstrate the safety of vaccinating someone with natural antibodies, the known risks are not worth the benefits for my age and health status. Furthermore, I'd rather face the evil I know and have already beaten (covid), then risk the major side effects, like brain fog, hormonal imbalance, heart inflammation, etc.</p>
<p>13) My sibling had vision problems and ended up in the ER immediately after the first shot. My sight, my mobility, my heart health, my hormonal balance, and my ability to think and work are all at risk of being significantly adversely affected by the vaccines. COVID was bad, but not as bad as any of those risks to me. </p>
<p>14) I am not responsible for anyone else's actions or choices. Driving comes with the risk of accidents. Being a member of society comes with the risk of contacting the flu, etc. There is no way to completely eliminate risk. Healthy people should be encouraged to be productive in order to strengthen society and the economy, otherwise we risk significant societal structural collapse (Atlas Shrugged, anyone?).</p>
