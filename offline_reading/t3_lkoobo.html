        <p>I'm female and I have observed a lot of that this past year, although a) I've also seen plenty of women who aren't like that, and b) I've been on lesbian dating apps but not straight ones, so my sample group is pretty skewed. </p>
<p>The typical profile of the most bigoted adherents of lockdown propaganda that I've seen, is a college-educated (often grad school educated) woman who is a semi-professional activist. Maybe she works as a freelance journalist for left-ish news/opinion websites, or maybe she's a musician who promotes herself as part of a playlist of artists from oppressed groups. She is not black, but talks nonstop on her social media about How to Be an Ally to Black Liberation. Contrary to conservative stereotypes, she isn't particularly likely to have purple hair.</p>
<p>Why women? My guess, based on the above, is that more women than men believe that Helping People is the way to get ahead, career-wise. And that more women than men are socialized, from an early age, to never show anger <em>unless it's part of a holy moral crusade.</em> The old stereotype of women being the moral guardians of the world while men go out and make money doing shit like screwing people on Wall Street.</p>

        <p>I feel like girls/women are socialized to be more compliant and confirming to authorities and also socialized to enforce conformity upon other women particularly, and society more generally.  Read any novel of manners/watch almost any period drama and you will see this dynamic in play.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. Also, generally speaking, women are more emotional rather than logical, so they are not as likely to use logic to work their way out of the fear that was pushed on them.</p>

        <p>We're judged as more emotional, and expected to be, but I don't think it's as simple in practice. What gets counted as 'emotional' or not is skewed by the observer's gendered expectations. Male politicians -and I'm not saying the female ones don't do this too- can pretty blatantly act on ego not logic, as I'm fairly sure we've seen throughout this, but that doesn't get counted 'emotional' as often. It's also an expectation that's extremely bound by time/place -I'm saying this having just taken a break from reading The Sorrows of Young Werther. Pretty good book so far-, with the narrowness of behaviour expected from men in Anglophone but especially US culture today -in so far as it affects the UK at all it is as an import- being quite the strikingly bizarre historical blip, far more so than sensibility.</p>

        <p>Interesting observation there. Definitely acting on ego is emotional as well. I would say almost everyone is driven by emotion. If you're not, it's extremely difficult to find people you can relate to, or have any sort of real human connection at all. Obviously most men aren't like that.</p>
<p>Can you expand on the narrowness of behaviour thing?</p>

        <p>It has it's good and bad points.  Women tend to want to help and care for others more but on the flip side, IMO they are more prone to caution and thus fear can have more influence for that reason.  In a balanced situation, women can keep an eye on men and reel them back from doing some of their extra stupid shxt.  And that kind of patience and love and attention to potential danger is really needed when raising children.  But in an unbalanced situation, you can have a lot of gossip, passive aggressive behavior, anxiety and incomprehensible behavior from them.</p>

        <p>And lets face it, a big percentage of men prefer women that are pliant and feminine and go along with what they say.  That trains us to act like that more.  However I think it tends to drive natural aggressive tendencies underground and you tend to get someone that is more passive aggressive and less straightforward.  They even themselves probably do not understand that part of themselves and how it is subtly driving their actions.</p>

        <p>That's funny cause I'm pretty easygoing with my bf but not at all with the government. I've mostly listened to my parents (except for during my teens, but who does?) and we agree politically, but am rebellious against most other types of authority. My sister has always been much more rebellious toward our parents, but is totally buying into all this BS. I don't know how any of that is connected, just some musings....</p>

        <p>Women are most likely to lean left politically as well, because their most important moral trait is "care", care about other. Jonathan Haidt and Jordan Peterson are explaining that quite well in some in some of their YT videos . They promoted lockdown as some virtue signalling that you actually care about others, hence I'm not surprised women are more likely to approve them. In my city, the only double-maskers I've seen are women working in clothing stores.</p>

        <p>I'm not super convinced by what I've read of either: Haidt overemphasizes the "today's college grads are fragile snowflakes" argument and thus misses the vicious cruelty of that crowd's power politics. And Jordan Peterson is of the "social inequality is natural, you can't fight biology" school of thought, which is typically used to justify continued oppression of various groups of people who were oppressed before, especially women.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that the psychological dynamic I've seen drive women towards lockdown propagandizing isn't "care"; it's masked rage finding a socially acceptable outlet. It has given women in my life a virtuous excuse to perform various uncaring behaviours like: dumping a "friend" just as she's dealing with serious anxiety/depression, telling someone suicidal to just go kill themselves, flaking out on a planned date, badmouthing strangers on social media, etc. Imo, the issue isn't so much "women like lockdowns because they are more caring", as "women are more likely to have been taught to feel obligated to <em>appear</em> caring, unselfish and non-angry at all times, thus they're more likely to channel their repressed anger into public moral crusades, instead of acknowledging that they have selfish desires and get angry for personal reasons."</p>

        <p>No, Peterson is much more than that...I don't want to debate that case here however. Women are that not oppressed. During my studies I encountered much more silent men in distress then what society acknowledged. I know this is a weak argument, but this is my life experience. I don't care much about society obligations.</p>

        <p>&rt; Women are ... not oppressed.</p>
<p>Women are much more likely to be oppressed by other women.</p>
<p>As to women often being the enforcers of ‘the new normal’, perhaps it’s true. But this is because they’re generally the social enforcers. They care much more about ‘what people think’.</p>
<p>In the traditional society, women made the men to be more conformist in order to be a good breadwinner. Women made boys into men (i.e. more  ‘responsible’ ). Traditional stereotypes.</p>

        <p>That rings true to me to an extent, though again I'd suspect it's culturally bound. US women can seem to me to have an 'edge' to them, relative to here in the UK, but the expectations to perform femininity at all times are so much higher. Current US expectations of men are also less flexible, often downright unfair on them as humans, with perceived deviation seen as more of a threat - meaning both that the men are placed under more pressure, but also the women dealing with the men in their life are, from the emotional impact on partners etc, what those expectations translate to practically (eg. men seeming to believe childcare isn't at all their role), and the expectations men have of them.</p>
<p>Just in general the US has different expectations, skewing I think more to extremes, of nice Vs. nasty behaviour.</p>
<p>Class is a factor too, I think, though that's always a very nuanced one.</p>

        <p>Their most important moral trait is social acceptance. They wouldn't "care" if you got beaten to death for not wearing a mask, because your opinions and actions carry a low social status. If the media-run state started assigning low social status to people who wore masks, 99% of women would make a complete 180 within one or two weeks.</p>
<p>That's why it's important not to a let a hostile tribe who wants to destroy you totally dominate every single institution of your society.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why women? My guess, based on the above, is that more women than men believe that Helping People is the way to get ahead, career-wise. And that more women than men are socialized, from an early age, to never show anger <em>unless it's part of a holy moral crusade.</em> The old stereotype of women being the moral guardians of the world while men go out and make money doing shit like screwing people on Wall Street.</p>
<p>This is called agreeableness in psychology, and it's been demonstrated that women tend to be more agreeable than men. Agreeable people tend to avoid confrontations and questioning the status quo because doing so may result in disagreement, hostility, or conflict between them and other people so in order to get along with others and maintain their positions in society they are often quick to give in to social norms.</p>

        <p>Women rate a whole standard deviation higher than men when it comes to the trait of agreeableness.  The content of the language or the argument are of little consequence as long as everyone is agreeable.   This comes from thousands of years of evolutionary pressure, where women back at the cave, tribal hut, village, or yurts were expected to raise the young and keep the society in harmony while the men fought wars, hunt sabertooth tigers, etc.  Hence, why the value of "showing care for others by wearing the mask" is being so rigidly enforced.  Women in those societies did not hold supreme power when the men returned from the hunt, but in modern society they do.  They can ruin your career and more if you step out of line with whatever the modern orthodoxy holds sacrosanct.</p>
<p>The wage gap is a lie to weaponize women against men so that they do not to trust them.  This eroding of the naturally evolved relationship dynamics between men and women results in failed marriages, which results in more unhappy and bitter women furthering resentment.  This resentment is amplified when you see women being lied to that they need to get a college degree, going into hundreds of thousands of dollars into debt and eschewing marriage and childbearing during their most fertile years so that they can pursue a "career."  That "career" ultimately culminates in sad childless brunches into their 30s, with a bunch of plastic Chinese made shit in an apartment with a cat they have used as a sad substitute for a real child.  By this point they have largely passed their reproductive prime and are no longer sought after by any high value male partner for the purposes of starting a family.</p>
<p>I don't know where I was going with this and honestly don't care... but rereading your comment which got me going: yeah, women fall for it and then they are bitter and angry about outcomes and then double down on it.</p>
<p>When have you ever seen some childless single woman who chose career over acknowledging their biological imperative that looked legitimately happy?  Would any of the ones who held deep regrets ever be honest with a younger generation of women and warn them of the perils associated with ignoring the natural drive to have children?  Or would they instead feel the need to encourage the younger woman to follow in their footsteps because in some twisted way this will validate their own decisions?</p>
<p>I think that's where you see these rabid women defending abortion.  No female mammal I can think of tries to actively kill their own offspring, because it goes against everything that is built into their being.  It is entirely counter to nature.  But women who have had abortions need for more women to have abortions, because in some sick way it validates their own decision.  If an entire generation of women stopped having abortions even not because of laws, but because it went against nature, it would mean the prior generations that did have abortions would be forced to recognize that true gravity of their own decisions.</p>

        <p>&rt;When have you ever seen some childless single woman who chose career over acknowledging their biological imperative that looked legitimately happy?</p>
<p>Very often, but it's not that common that anyone of either sex chooses that. Nor is it even a logical choice. Women do have careers and children, just like men. Most jobs aren't even going to cause an issue. In my own family, my aunt, who is married, simply couldn't have children - in reality when people who'd wanted children are childless, it's usually because something just didn't work out.</p>
<p>I get the impression that history isn't your forte. It's not necessary to look at it very much, though, to see that working and lower middle class women have always worked. Even only going as far back as my grandmother, worked in a factory, had four children. Nor that marital unhappiness, or simply discord, isn't new. Life isn't a fifties advert of a shiny family, mum in front of the latest kitchen gadget.</p>
<p>Female mammals do kill their own offspring, entirely literally, it's a survival mechanism, often when resources are too scarce, or the mother is under stress in a situation that's not safe. Chinchillas -long gestation period- can reabsorb kits in the womb, other rodents and rabbits will eat offspring. Nature isn't a shiny picture, either. I had to intervene with a chinchilla mum snarling and lunging at her blind baby, I think she knew something was wrong, they can reject kits, especially with health issues, luckily my two are Ok together now.</p>
<p>The more you learn about societies over time, and nature, the more things look more complex than some modern gender stereotypes, I think.</p>

        <p>"Very often, but it's not that common that anyone of either sex chooses that. " - modern society promotes this childlessness through the lens of "environmental consciousness," hedonistic consumerism and white guilt.</p>
<p>"In my own family, my aunt, who is married, simply couldn't have children" - this is unfortunate and a sad fact of life, however it does not mean that they did not desire children.  In a lot of these cases, women in these situations end up adopting or becoming "aunty-moms."</p>
<p>I never said women didn't work in the past, or shouldn't participate in the modern workforce.  I just said that promoting the lie of career-woman foremost over motherhood is fundamentally toxic and unnatural.  A career is second to and should always be second to being a mother.   Similarly a man's job nor his career should define him more than his family he provides for and protects.</p>
<p>As far as your examples of females killing offspring, this is done as a "survival mechanism."  Messing up a college timeline, a 5-year career plan or whatever other rationale used is not "survival."  It is terminating offspring because of convenience, not a lack of resources.   Maybe in a third-world country I could see this argument being made, but there they wouldn't have access to abortion clinics, so it's a moot point.  A mother rejecting young in the wild is usually due to survival strategy and  resource scarcity.</p>
<p>Anyways, I was mad at first when I read the "history isn't your forte" comment but the rest of it really didn't seem mean spirited and I too am always learning more about nature and society so I thought I'd respond.  You seem like a nice girl and I hope that you do not find yourself too down by all the rampant insanity being shoved down our throats under the pretext of the "greater good" as of present.</p>

        <p>She did want children, and she's not coincidentally my favourite aunt. I am, though, also fond of my aunt who didn't want children, has never had any, and is clearly happy that way. She wasn't career-focused, just didn't want children.</p>
<p>I guess what I wonder, is the extent to which 'career women not having children' is a reality Vs. a myth? Certainly to the extent one could generalise about it. It's almost a played-out concept at this point, since it's been hanging around since at least the Boomers. Most of whom failed, despite dire warnings, predictions, and accusations about their intentions, to end up childless, though I can't vouch as well for their lack of bitterness, but eh, that's life. Looking at various factors most likely to result in undesired childlessness, and weighing probability, irresolvable infertility seems much more likely, followed by just not finding a stable relationship, than a woman somehow managing to prioritise a career, one that must have been seriously near-incompatible with children, which isn't many jobs, with absolute single-minded dedication, then changing their minds about wanting children at the absolute last minute, and fertility treatments not helping. I'm not saying it never ever happens, just that it must be so rare. There's a lot of very specific things that have to happen for that to be their situation. The vast, vast majority of those women had children, same for the Xers.</p>
<p>Certainly I've seen the odd wealthy-middle-class Millennial/Zoomer Lib think-piece about 'not having children because environmental concerns', but they're as eyeroll-worthy and disconnected from most people's reality -including the reality of more thorough environmental concern or clear genuine not wanting children-, as, well, anything else printed in The Guardian is. These women are typically still very young. Perhaps they got picked on and commissioned for the piece and aren't actually as convinced as they, sometimes unconvincingly, claim. Maybe 'environmental concerns' is just a trendy buzzword, maybe it's an excuse for normal human doubts, uncertainty, and ambivalence - having children is a big decision. Maybe they really are focused on maintaining a certain lifestyle for now: in this case, maybe they're just not ready for children, it's very normal for young couples. Maybe they don't want children now and will later: one of those feelings doesn't necessarily invalidate the other. Maybe they don't want children and never will. Women can sincerely feel that way. It's probably best for the children that those who don't, don't have any. I wouldn't expect that made the writers representative of an entire demographic of women.</p>
<p>But either way, oughtn't people -without interference from the government- make their own major life decisions, potentially bad ones or not? If an impulse were so consistent, strong and biological, a few Guardian articles aren't going to squash it. The women affected themselves wouldn't be most to blame if it did.</p>
<p>Not at all, different people are interested in different things, is all. I've shifted to more history from literature, but the latter of course still comes with a lot of historical context. Learning French the year before last and adding that context has been great.</p>
<p>Working class women didn't just contribute, what they did was essential: work or starve, and quite possibly starve anyway, with their children of course working alongside them. Middle class women, depending when/where we're looking at, their 'job' may well be wife, much more than mother. Babies sent off to wet nurses, older children handed off to the governess, boarding schools, etc. Their mothers create art, they write, they take serious interest in politics, in the sciences, perhaps particularly botany. Perhaps they are neglectful, but the fathers are also. Perhaps human parents often are.</p>
<p>Nor were the SAHM within our living memory necessarily particularly good parents, much less saintly mothers. My own has always liked to declare, somewhat pointedly 'It's like cats, they fuss over their kittens for a bit, then they get fed up of them'. Nurturing and ambivalence shading to indifference, as united rather than as incompatible impulses.</p>
<p>Are we humans wild, or are we self-domesticated, though? ; ) It's very much something animal breeders have to deal with either way, that evolutionary stress response is still in play.</p>
<p>&rt;You seem like a nice girl and I hope that you do not find yourself too down by all the rampant insanity being shoved down our throats under the pretext of the "greater good" as of present.</p>
<p>Thanks, hope you're bearing up under it Ok too. Ah, well... I feel this a little more, and I know I'm far from the only one, where the governments' utter trainwreck derailment of any life plans, leaves them in the situation where one of the things they're asking themselves is 'huh, maybe I won't ever be in a position to have children, if that's what I'd want to do...?'. I'm a hopeless romantic: drawn to ideals that aren't so much 'traditional' as 'you do realise those are over two hundred years out of date?'. I didn't set out to own half the stock exchange or be a master chef with a chain of starred restaurants, or anything of the all-encompassing-career sort. Nor did I set out to become significantly disabled: that's medical negligence and bad luck and a much more significant barrier to all forms of life plans than lockdown to date. It's...the cards fall as they fall, sometimes you don't even get to concretely decide what you might or might not have wanted. What would have needed to happen for things to be different? Lots of things, lots of improbable ones perhaps, does anyone ever know for certain? I would have liked/would like to remain in academia, but in terms of career, taken in the sense of life plans, I think I would have been quite right, that was by far where I am most likely to encounter people with whom I am compatible in any case. In twenty years, if a miracle treatment is forthcoming, if I am a lecturer with pets and no children, should my lifelong love of literature and animals be judged, by those who do not ask or care to know the circumstances or who expect neat and definite responses, as surely the product of second-best embittered disappointment? In the book I am reading, the hero is charmed by, yes, his, somewhat comically questionable, impression of the heroine's maternal care for her little siblings, but also by her views on literature, her enjoyment of dance. Maybe that is not terribly realistic. It also contains this line:</p>
<p>&rt;Yes, without doubt, my friend, you are right; men would suffer less vivid pains if ... (God knows why they are made thus ...), if they did not apply all the forces of their imagination to constantly renewing the memory of their past troubles, instead of abiding with a present that seems to hold no meaning to them.</p>

        <p>I think there is a real cultural disconnect between our perspectives because of our nationalities.  I also think your views are forever going to be through the lens of someone "significantly" disabled. Whatever that disability is, my heart goes out to you and in no way am I discounting your opinions.<br>
You have had to come to terms with a great deal of things that deviate from the norm, so while your views and opinions are valid, your outlook cannot be assumed to be the norm.  You've had to interpret the world through your position in it, which if is disabled, is not through the same thought process as someone who is not.  I say this because you seem to be highly intelligent, analytical and thorough.  Most people who are not autists or have suffered some malady like you will never know this level of interpreting the world.  I say this in response to your saying that a few Guardian articles a year about the lack of need to have children.  It's actually quite frequent and a lot more than you recollect, and to the average person its subliminal power given to the propaganda behind it is very strong.  Look at how brainwashed they are to Covid-19.  Because you are immune doesn't mean they are not.
I realize that you are quite intelligent and have spun a significantly intricate tapestry through which you filter the world.  Once I started reading, I really couldn't help myself but read the rest of it with a thick British disaffected accent.  I'm not trying to be insulting but what you wrote seems fundamentally sound, but at a base level more bleak than anything I have ever read in my life.  It was the mood of Morvern Callar, situated with a slight British twist and it felt like your island, hopelessly dreary and detached.
I hope you find true passion and happiness, and please whatever you do do not try to parse through the ins and outs of this response.  Just know that I see you, recognize the weight you carry and see a beautiful person deserving of beautiful things.  So seek out those with which your spirit most lies, and forsake those who wish to diminish your spirit.  You are a formidable force, you deserve better than to expel your musings hopelessly here in the void.
See, this is what happens when you listen to too many Oswald Mosley speeches and start corresponding with a Brit, absolute madness.
Be well friend.</p>

<p>LMAO, you really think women can ONLY be happy by having children?  That's just so wrong.  I never even wanted children. I could have them if I wanted but I just didn't.  They are a lot of work and I like my free time. One cat is about the extent of my maternal instincts and he's a fairly independent cat.  I thought maybe as I got older, I would change my mind but it never happened.  I think it's great if other women want to have children, I would never judge them. I think people should be able to live the life they want as long as they don't hurt others.  I also think the world is more fun with a variety of people in it.  I would hate for there to be only one mold and everyone has to fit into it.</p>

        <p>I really hope that you are happy, that you aren't lying to yourself, or even worse that you don't realize that you've been tricked into thinking this is what you wanted but wake up one day with a pit of regret.  I'm not saying this as a snarky asshole, I genuinely mean it.  I don't think women should be forced to have children.</p>
<p>I'm just speaking from personal experience as a man near 40, I bought into a lot of these white guilt, world is so terrible, the world is filled with pain and suffering so why bring a kid in the world, just enjoy the childless consumerism and lack of responsibility... all that I mentioned above in another comment.  I was fine and happy until I hit 35 and then the biological urge to have children hit me.  Baby fever for men is real too.  I don't really know how to explain it but the innocence of children would make me inexplicably start wanting to cry when I would see them sometimes, not weep, just get misty eyed.  I say this as a man, who is a lot further right than the mainstream, as someone who has experienced tremendous pain, austerity and mortal danger without buckling.  And I see these kids and I'm a fucking wreck. </p>
<p>And I know it's not too late for myself, but lately I feel like it almost is.  This fucking world is absolutely batshit right now and once I realize I want kids, I'm thinking to myself "I can't bring kids into a world so insane they will be force vaccinated or forced to wear a mask for a virus that is no threat to them."  And it's fucking depressing as hell, like this is worse than anything I've ever gone through in my life.  I'm in that pit now myself, and I hope that you and others don't find yourself here.</p>

        <p>Same. I'm 32 and have NEVER had the desire to have a kid. I wasn't around them much growing up, never a babysitter, etc. and I think that might have more to do with it. I would probably be a decent mother cause I would give up my whole life for a kid if I had one, like my mom did for me, but I just don't want to do that. And I'm grateful I never had that maternal instinct, since I would never want to bring a child into the world we're living in now!</p>

        <p>Actually, there are female mammals that eat their young. It's a well known phenomenon with dogs. Male lions are also known to eat the offspring of female lions before they mate with them. It's natural for nature to be brutal.</p>

        <p>I addressed this in my response to the other comment.  I know male bears do the same of murdering cubs in hope of passing on their own genetics.</p>
<p>So I stand corrected in that female mammals eat their young in survival situations or even kill offspring with defects in maximizing chances of the healthy normal offspring surviving.  I'm pretty sure that is the vast majority of cases this is done when there is a resource scarcity and the chances of survival of the young have dropped (deformities, etc.).</p>
<p>This doesn't apply to people in the first world.  There is not a resource scarcity.  And not being able to afford paying for private school or college tuition is not resource scarcity.  It's a luxury deficit.  </p>
<p>With all of the social safety nets at hand in America and other first world nations with food banks, food stamps, Section 8 housing, church &amp; charity food and clothing drives, etc. there is no acceptable excuse for a woman who has not 1. been raped, 2. found the baby having some horrific deformity or 3. found a major health risk to mother/child, to have an abortion.</p>
<p>Anything other than those reasons, does not constitute a risk to survival of the offspring/mother, it constitutes a mother killing their offspring due to convenience.  The lie today is that somehow flippantly killing your own child should be taken lightly because spring break is around the corner, and that somehow this can be related to what happens in nature when animals are pushed to the most stressful limits of their survival.</p>

        <p>My husband and i noticed that too. Schools are run by women who wants power control.
Few years ago we went to a meeting for our son,the principal,a teacher and another specialist (all women) welcomed us in their office,they were sitting on regular computer chairs and they gave us small chairs for children in kindergarden.
After a while they asked us to sit and we said NO. They demanded again that we sit and we said that if they want us to sit than give us chairs meant for grown up adults.</p>
<p>The chairs were so low that even me as a petite woman it was ridiculous but my husband who's a war veterant made it clear that they won't look down on us.</p>
<p>They called a MAN to go get chairs for us....</p>

        <p>I made it clear to my kids that using the bathroom is a right and not a privilege and that even if the teacher says no,they are allowed to go and i will deal with it after.</p>
<p>I also notice that they love to defend little girls who hit or bully boys and they always take their sides. My son came home with bitting mark on his arm,we could see the teeth of that little girl and he's the one who got punished because he apparantly "bugged" her so much that this is how she defended herself...Just imagine for a second that it was the other way around.</p>
<p>I seriously don't understand their reasoning and reading some of them online gives me goosebumps,in particular those who hate men and go get abortions as soon as they find out it's a boy. Just wow. These women are teaching to our kids and that's scary.</p>

        <p>Maybe not lump them all together.  I have known some really good teachers and I have also known some really bad ones. I do think in any org, there tends to be a certain type that likes power and works hard to get it.  The average person might find a lot of the chores distasteful but the power hungry will be eager to perform just for a tiny taste of that power and so they will tend to fight hard for those kinds of positions.</p>

        <p>Not all. But yes, many.</p>
<p>I'm a teacher. I wanted to become a teacher since 7th grade because I had an amazing English teacher then. She broke all the standards of the time...came to class in jeans and a mullet. Walked on the desks and taught us poetry. She defended and was a safe person for all us LGBT+ students at a time when that was rare and counter cultural. I was severely bullied and depressed until she showed me a way to express my pain through poetry and find support in other people outside the box.</p>
<p>I became a teacher so I could both be that to other kids, and also impart some of what I'm decent at to another generation. I couldn't care less about having authority over anyone, and a couple of my favorite students are some rowdy ones who I get a kick out of because I know they're just expanding their boundaries and figuring out who they are.</p>
<p>The problem isn't teachers. It's bad teachers. And like I said, theres a lot of them, but there's good ones too. Ones that show the way to think for yourself and provide a space for the outcasts to become empowered. Like my 7th grade teacher was. And hopefully someday I can be that for my students as well.</p>

        <p>I can definitely see how it’s relevant to the younger generation, as they are being brainwashed by tech, media, parents, etc. and being taken out of school and social settings leads to even less knowledge being spread but I don’t think this is true for women. If so, why?</p>

        <p>As a woman, I have found lately that my opinions are not tolerated at all in women-heavy communities on left-leaning sites (like Reddit). It's really demoralizing that I would have to pretend that I agree with the Female Conglomerate or get banned, shunned, and silenced. I hate that people assume I agree with the Accepted Viewpoint because of my appearance. Funny that they pretend they're all about strong women and uplifting women's voices, unless the woman is saying something that makes them uncomfortable. I don't want this meme and message to be real, but clearly I am in the minority especially on social media - and I hate that.</p>

        <p>So bloody true.  There’s a reason that meme “Karen” has took hold.  The most common bullies in the world in my experience are women.  There’s some particular feminine personality out there that rejoices in criticizing, belittling and tattling on others for not being as compliant, well put together sheep as they are.  Almost a “teacher’s pet” kind of thing.</p>

        <p>Women are biologically conditioned to obey authority figures. When they're young, it's their father. Traditionally the responsibility for being an authority figure passed from father to husband (that's why the father symbolically "gives away" the daughter during wedding ceremonies).</p>
<p>In modern times women have somehow decided that it's more "empowering" and "brave" to submit to big daddy government instead. So now every man in America is getting cucked by Fauci.</p>
<p>They genuinely NEED male authority or they go feral. That's why any workplace dominated by women quickly devolves into an insane asylum (schools, hospitals, HR).</p>

        <p>Isn't big daddy government, especially the ruling cabal of it, often mostly men, though? In cases where it is, like here in the UK, lockdown is their bloody stupid idea, and it's their ability to enforce it, not women's.</p>
<p>If I was inclined to generalise, I don't think it would give the impression they're capable of being responsible for anything without going insane. Here in the UK, men historically designed our institutions. To run the country, they thought it was necessary to have a stadium-like chamber in which they yell and make 'hurrhurr' noises at each other. Honestly, what rational human being would think that was a good way to organise anything?</p>
<p>Of course, I wouldn't generalise, because that would be grossly unfair.</p>
<p>My dad is a doomer, and he agreed with the invasion of Iraq. Maybe it's good I apparently skipped out on that bit of biological conditioning, otherwise I'd apparently be obliged to agree with him, and, um, all the men in government, while no woman in my family does?</p>

        <p>For a subreddit that's apperently very against silencing and hating oppression, they sure like downvoting the opposite opinion while feeling safe and secure in their own beliefs, intentionally blocking out any challenge.

        <p>Upvotes and Downvotes are part of the reddit game and you agreed with it by making your profile.</p>
<p>You are not being censored because you got downvoted,see you are still here and allowed to post. You aren't banned. People are only expressing their disagreement but they didn't cancel you.</p>
<p>You find it weird that they choose to trust certain sources and not others ?  That's fair. That's EXACTLY what we are saying too. </p>
<p>I personally choose to not listen to the sources of mainstream medias because the governement is funding them to tell us what they want. The fourth power used to be that real journalists tell the population what the governement is doing but these days it's the other way around. Their sources are biaised.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't care about up or downvotes, I was more referencing the "down/upvote, move on" mentality of quick dismissal.</p>
<p>I agree with distrust for the government, they lie and do horrible things a lot, but sometimes they agree with others and help promote that idea. For example, they promote the food pyramid, and it's proven not just by science but by looking around and seeing "hey, maybe eating fruits and not fast food is healthy"</p>
<p>As for the sources, I agree the media twists things, but that's true regardless of the side. Do I think opening a window will give you covid or masks have trackers(both extreme hyperbolic examples)? Of course not. But the amount of research going into this isn't there to scam people. The banking, taxing, medical (USA at least) already drains enough cash. But you can't dismiss all mainstream media as fiction, because a lot of it can be factual.</p>
<p>My final thoughts are that worst case scenario, if all of covid is fake, I'm just wearing a mask, a minor, minor, inconvience that I honestly don't get bugged by at all. But if covid is deadly, and I'm not wearing a mask, I'd feel like an asshole for helping spread it. Basically I'd rather be safe than sorry.</p>

        <p>It's generally from the responses given. Notice how she (I assume) clearly doesnt make a very well though out response. It's pure, mindless outrage. People on this sub do not stand for that and what it represents to them. And in the case of them not really listening to other arguments, it really depends on the subject matter or rather they have assessed it and found it lacking. </p>
<p>Women are more prone to acts of deceit towards others. They follow along with it out of the will to preserve their social standing and social security. It's just the nature of a woman but is not favourable to men who are more likely to stand up to something like this. Which is why he quoted Orwell on it.</p>

        <p>What leaves you to believe the person I replied to is a women, I'm curious? As for mindless outrage, that's what most of what this sub appears to be. This entire sub is upset with the current times and when I can get behind that in some cases, actively going against a solution that's been presented without trying it for a little while is as close minded as saying women are followers.</p>
<p>Anyone can be prone to deceit, the only people who specifically say women are more prone to deceit are usually incels who specifically have something against women. The rest of your argument is just generalization without even a single comparrassion. To which I leave you- men can do that too. Most of the Nazi army was men. Mind you, the nazis were also very close minded, not a majority group, and preached against modern and progressive society for a "better simpler time". </p>
<p>So if you somehow get confused the tldr: that's a sexist generalization, and I'm comparing the majority of anti mask people to any group in history who wants to intentionally hault progress because they're selfish megalo-nymphs</p>
