    <strong>Sharing About *New* r/r4rconspiracy Community</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Note:</strong> I lurk and know not everyone here believes in conspiracies, but I hope if you do you would consider! Mods- Let me know if this is out of bounds.</p>
<p>It's never been easy going against the grain and questioning narratives, but especially now. Many of us have seen hits to our friendships, work, family, and romantic relationships simply for darring to question what we've been fed. I too, grew exhausted of this and formed  <a href="https://ibb.co/hK9L6T4">r/r4rconspiracy</a>.</p>
<p>This 18+ community is a place to connect you to all kind of relationships i.e. platonic, romantic, casual, FWB, research buddies, longterm, shortterm, watch party, etc. </p>
<p>This community was created for conspiracy theorists, novice to experts alike, to have unrestricted community and ability to connect. You are not a side show, so you deserve to have others you can be your full self with without the threat of censorship, shills, trolls, or prying eyes. That said, this community has been restricted. </p>
<p>Only approved users will be allowed to join, post, and comment so that there will be less worrying about the ability to be your full self and find your people. While this is the goal, please remember to respect others. It is fine to have controversial conspiracies, just not offensive ones. The difference is one is based in substance and good intent. The other is the opposite.</p>
<p>To join, please message u/throwaway9591SFV, for now. Please send your invitation requests with the following: how long you have been into conspiracies, why you want to join this community (brief), and what conspiracies you endorse. <strong>This just helps to sort out bad parties ex. trolls, etc.</strong></p>
<p>You will not be turned away based on what conspiracies you endorse. You will however, be turned away if it is evident you are a troll, do not intend to follow subreddit rules, or intend to cause trouble.</p>
<p>As we expand, particularly in terms of the mod team, we will reconsider if there is any wisdom in opening back up fully.</p>
<p>While we are at this time officially SFW, NSFW posts are fully permitted. These posts are generally automarked as such, but occassionally the automation doesn't get it right.</p>
<p>Feel free to hit me up if you're interested in modding or having anything you'd like to provide as input (for consideration). We are a small community and brand new as of right now. We hope you join in and spread the word.</p>
<p>Just make sure to read the rules, and don't get yourself banned.</p>
<p>Ok' bye.</p></p>
