    <strong>Words of Encouragement</strong>
    <p><p>Let’s be a part of history. </p>
<p>We are standing firm on these matters for our descendants, for our people, the coming generations. </p>
<p>No one ever said totalitarianism or tyranny could NOT appear in the guise of technocratic “medical” or “public health policy” regimes (the least pernicious motives, at best, in this particular situation). </p>
<p>They now, obviously, have begun shedding the public health guise. </p>
<p>There is no necessity that tyranny needs to start with political parties—but it <em>always</em> begins with fear and hysteria and a moral panic of some kind.</p>
<p>This operation has been creeping incrementally, but it’s crossing the line into open despotism and epistemological fascism (the coming hammer of <em>total</em> censorship). </p>
<p>We know people are protesting all across the world over these restrictions, but you won’t hear of it from the media—because <em>they don’t want us to know we have massive numbers of co-resisters.</em>  </p>
<p>Let’s be a part of history our descendants will look back upon with pride. We will again become those who said no to George III, the abolitionists who went against the “settled racial science” and economic arguments of their day, those people tearing up the Berlin Wall. </p>
<p>Such things  never need come to pass—because of us, now.</p>
<p>Nothing is inevitable, although they (and their social media zombies) want you to think so. </p>
<p>There are far more of us questioning and saying no then we might imagine. The loudest voices crowd out the thoughtful and courageous. Especially on social media, where algorithms and bots can prevail upon and overwhelm those who dissent. </p>
<p>That day many of us imagined might be approaching is about to arise, if not already here. We need to be ready.</p></p>

        <p>So does everyone. But this has become a genuine struggle these past six months. I don’t want to either, but that’s the forced choice we’re facing.</p>
