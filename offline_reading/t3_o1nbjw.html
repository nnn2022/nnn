    <strong>This is just a eugenics program</strong>
    <p><p>You know the government is getting rid of the low hanging fruit of our species, right? Hell they might even be on our side, as weird as that sounds.</p>
<p>So dont waste your energy trying to convince people of anything. There is enough information out there for these people to make a sane, rational decision about their health.</p>
<p>Victimhood is a very powerful thing. If these 'people' believe that getting a needle in their arm is the right thing to do, then let them proceed...</p></p>

        <p>I might make a comment on a troll's post that amuses me, or lets out some of my vitriol towards them, but I never bother with "sources" or "citations" or any of that shit anymore. They've proven <em>countless</em> times that they don't read, they don't watch videos, and they don't think about anything they may skim over. It is truly a wasted effort at this point. </p>
<p><em>In person, however...</em></p>
<p>I just had an exchange with the laundry lady that lasted about 20 minutes. And she is very, very, very much a doomer. And it was weird, as we kept talking, I just asked about 10-15 times through the course of the conversation "if the vaccine works and it's effective, what are you scared of? Do you not believe you're protected?" Not in a creepy broken record way, but I just kept coming back to it, over and over. And toward the end, she finally just admitted that she can't stop being scared. She literally said "I know, you're right, but I can't figure out how to stop being scared." </p>
<p>I could see something clicked, and I doubt they'll change the mask policy I argued with them about earlier in the day, but I could see a little light go off in her that said "yeah...this is literally all fear-based. There is no science behind my feelings." </p>
<p>Small victory? Maybe, maybe not. But I at least saw her recognize that.</p>

        <p>See I totally agree with what you posted here, but I have another observation on encounters like this.</p>
<p>When I have met someone that is clearly on the fence, or making bold remarks like, "I would never get the f**kin vaccine!" we would converse. The conversation would go back and forth on why it's such a strange phenomenon that our governments actually care about us, rushing the vaccine, etc. and it would leave off like a very strong positive open-minded talk.</p>
<p>Then a week or two later that same person (has happened to a few people I've talked to) would come back and say, "yeah my parents forced me to get it", or "I need it for my job" and I would say in my head, "well that was weird, didn't they remember our heart-to-heart we just had??"</p>
<p>So what I've concluded is that this is an example of the saying, 'You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink'. I don't know why that saying has always stuck in my head, but it rings true right now. At the end of the day these 'people' are either a hybrid of a true open-minded human being, or they exist in another dimension on top of our dimension and they react, before they think.</p>
<p>I feel like communities such as /r/nonewnormal and other Youtubers that I follow are simply echo-chambers for those that are already in the community. There is a very very very small percentage switching teams, and I think that the human race was divided a few years ago. Definitely after 2010 is when people started to see the light, and realize that something is definitely broken in our world.</p>
<p>Those that are already on the boat of sanity have been here, and those that are lost at sea have been lost the entire time, and WILL NOT be joining us in the new world.</p>
<p>But I guess that if you have a pure heart you will still try to reach those that are blind and deaf (figuratively, not literally)...</p>

        <p>I can't agree with you because I was a Democrat for 7 Presidential election cycles and I've never, ever voted for a Republican in my life.</p>
<p>I'll be voting straight Republican ticket for the foreseeable future.</p>

        <p>Yeah but you know that there is a third choice in the presidential election, right? The choice is not to vote.</p>
<p>Why do you think the government pushes the phrase, 'every vote counts' so hard? Because they know that when you vote for red or blue, you are voting. Voting is consent to being governed. When you consent, you CANNOT complain about the outcome of the election, because you did your duty of voting at the polling place, and you agreed to having SOMEONE govern you with that vote.</p>
<p>The dragon has two heads, or if you like this analogy better, the right and the left wing carry the head of the eagle in the same direction.</p>

        <p>Like I mentioned above, when you vote, you are giving your permission to be governed by any of the candidates.</p>
<p>We do not need a president. Existing with smaller local governments, that can be voted out by the community, would be a safer way to live. Supposedly when the government was formed, it was supposed to be a small organization, not the massive monster it has become.</p>
<p>Anyways when you vote you give away your natural human rights to be free on this land. If voting was important, they wouldn't let us do it. It gives universal consent when you place your ballot in, and that tells the universe that you are OK with being governed.</p>
<p>Do you understand what I'm saying?</p>

        <p>There is still hope. My neighbor (72M) never believed me and for years thought I held outrageous beliefs about the Gov. </p>
<p>I don't know what it was that finally made him realize I wasn't crazy, I think it was a gradual thing. I put him onto Reiner Fuellmich, told him about the Aussie vaccine deaths...  When they had us believe that people were falling over dying in the street last Feb I told him it was just Gov BS. He didn't believe me back then. I reminded him about it a couple of weeks ago and asked him why no one else is falling over in the street any more and I think that kind of flicked a switch.</p>
<p>He now watches UK Column and is a reader of this subreddit.</p>

        <p>I think it's more than you would imagine but it must be a bit of a struggle when they first wake up. Imagine you lost a close family member then find out if treatments hadn't been withheld for political reasons, they would still be alive? That's going to take time for some people.</p>
<p>There are also so many bots and paid shills on reddit that it makes it look like we're in the minority.</p>

        <p>I feel somewhat compelled to disagree. I feel we should do our best to inform these people and encourage them to think for themselves. Alot of the citizens in this great nation have simply been indoctrinated from a young age to do as they are told and not ask questions as to why, this leads to poor critcal thinking skills. The media then reinforces the indoctrination and uses that to manipulate people.</p>

        <p>Yeah but it's deeper than this. People will make incredible excuses to back up the government and the current circus that's playing out. They will go to BOLD lengths to back up each and every claim, and ridicule/insult those that disagree with the current status quo.</p>
<p>Normal people don't do that. Normal people can have polite conversations on why they disagree on certain things. Think sports fans debating on their favorite teams, or food fanatics talking about their favorite restaurants, or movie buffs about their favorite movies. Calm discussions about things that are important in their lives.</p>
<p>To me that feels eery and strange. These are people from all walks of life, rich or poor, healthy or sick. To me there is something very strange happening, and the programming just doesn't work on certain people, whereas others eat it up like a bowl of frosted flakes.</p>

        <p>Agreed. The people that truly need to wake up are those that are already in our boat. They need to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Soul is eternal and the rulers of this game are trying to capture your soul, energetically. They don't care about the human body, they care about what's controlling the human body.</p>
<p>You feeding into their game is giving them more electricity. Playing the game is arguing about the rules of the game to others playing the game. The best way to play this game is to understand it's a game and not get involved emotionally (energetically).</p>

        <p>Agreed, if we take a step back and realize the Earth is just fine, the animals are just fine, and everything seems fine when you turn off the TV, we will all be fine.

        <p>When I relate to energy harvesting, I like to also mention that your experiences in this reality are constantly evolving to attract negativity if you'll allow it. When people say they are just having a 'bad day' it's that one bad thing happens to them, they allow the negativity to flow through them, and then that negative energy attracts more negativity. I am a believer in there being no such thing as coincidences.</p>
<p>Since discovering an alternative narrative in 2010, and following the likes of Alex Jones, who gets angry and tells the viewer to get angry, I've realized that's what the game wants. They don't care what side you are on, as long as you are putting your entire energy into the belief that this reality is all there is, they are happy with that.</p>
<p>They give both sides tons of valid information, whether you are a democratic, republic, truth seeker, they will throw out tons of breadcrumbs to get you to follow any of it. It's best to just understand this life is a complete joke, and to realize that you cannot save anyone. This is a lone journey and people need to stop putting energy into trying to get the other side to see their points.</p>

        <p>What non coincidentally perfect timing on your part. (Off topic anecdote, just felt kind of significant in the moment) One person in the house definitely had a few bad things happen this morning. They're usually really good about redirecting negative energy and not letting themselves unleash it on others, and today was an outlier, but your comment has helped me remember not to let that negativity grow in me. </p>
<p>It's hard to choose to be pleasant and loving. But I know it is a more effective means to achieve a more positive atmosphere in a home. Your comment was enough to tip over the first domino in the line of "good day" events. Much appreciated.</p>

        <p>Thank you! Someone from my post pointed me to yours. Yes sadly it's true that not all lives matter and the stigma/moral/ethical implications this topic has is exactly why people don't care to even consider talking about depopulation. It's also why I don't think our posts would be removed because they can just brand us as scary "conspiracy theorists" and the majority of people will just go with that.</p>
<p>It really is funny to me how we have so much documented history of real and crazy shit that has gone down, but yet people will refuse to believe that we could coincidental be living in a time in history where again, unprecedented crazy shit might be going down.</p>

        <p>Great minds think alike!</p>
<p>I guess I compare the all live matter, to the propoganda about voting they spew every 4 years. Telling everyone their vote matters. Well in theory one single vote out of 100s of millions of vote, statistically does not matter. But what's more interesting about the voting is that you give consent to being ruled by SOMEONE, doesn't matter if it's the person you voted for.</p>
<p>When I started seeing the homeless wear masks in early April (the same homeless shooting up dirty needles into their arms, and pissing on the streets) I knew something was horribly wrong with this reality.</p>
<p>Yeah this could be the reason why you and I are alive at this point, to face through this battle and see if we will stay true to our God given DNA. Because after all, they have made it explicitly clear that this vaccine is completely different than all the others. It will be changing a person's DNA, making them something other than a natural bred human.</p>

        <p>Yeah it sure looks that way, believe me, I've had that opinion for the last 10 years, but it wasn't until last year that I realized the governments all over the world are just playing a role in this game.</p>
<p>None of us know how we got here, and maybe we consented to their rule over us before we came to this earth, but we know that the people that make up the governments are too stupid to continue this charade with expert precision. There is some other power in control that we cannot see, or cannot know.</p>

        <p>I still hold strong to the bio weapons test theory. But hypothetically it could be a new foreign regime trying to fight the old soviet machine that infected America's before the fall of the USSR</p>

        <p>I'm not worried about all the liberal lunatics kicking off. That would be refreshing. Where my concern lies is that we are about to lose many doctors, military, and other first responders, which will set our society back to the stone ages. There's no stopping the fact that we are about to undergo a reset. The only unknown, is which side gets to choose the reset plan.</p>

        <p>Doctors are pill pushers, military is completely pointless as we fight wars we don't need to, and first responders can be replaced. The only good use of the medical industry is for severe injuries that require you to be stitched back together. </p>
<p>I think we will be okay however.</p>
