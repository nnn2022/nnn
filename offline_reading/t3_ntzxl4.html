    <strong>People think in the short term not the long term: Instant gratification taking people down wrong road.</strong>
    <p><p>I told my husband people are choosing short term gain, and short term gratification over long term health. So they take an experimental vaxx so they can go out and do things and be with their friends now and "fit in". It is scary as hell watching people question nothing and not even have worries about what the vaxx could do in the future. People are being led by instant gratification. Even the people dragging their kids to get the poison, refuse to think of long term things like a child being healthy, or living to be old, or being able to have children, they only care about today.  I never knew human beings could be such short term thinkers, it is shocking.</p></p>

        <p>And to think they didn’t even consider that they could “go out and do things” regardless of what the TV told them amazes me. Zero self respect or bodily autonomy</p>

        <p>Honestly, I think it’s they’re blind faith and medicine. I’ve heard a few people in my own life say “well we’ll cross that bridge when it gets here, for now we need to to go back to normal,” I think they believe we’ll be medically advanced enough to find unknown future symptoms. No one truly knows what the future has to hold and most people haven’t dealt with serious issue, so when they think I’ll have such and such issue they compare it to that (in ways I have been guilty of this but not with covid) because pain and suffering is subjective to ones experience. Not everyone knows the pain of a true ailment, some unfortunately do and I find them more hesitant on the unknown side effect part, not even the mandatory part. So when the average person thinks ok back to normal now for instant gratification (which is something I personally understand as I know many others do) and compares it to the pain of a broken bone constantly it’s really not that “scary” when in reality everything can far surpass our wildest expectations.</p>

        <p>I had a man tell me “I agree that the vaccine could be part of a population control agenda or have bad long term effects. But I’d rather turn into a gorilla 5 years from now than die of covid today”. I didn’t know what to say to that.</p>

<p>I heard stuff like that. A few laughed to me, we are old [50s-60s in this case] and are going to die soon anyway.</p>

        <p>I would’ve asked them “so you don’t care about the children?”. Ik they were probably not taking you seriously, but it would definitely make them uncomfortable and possibly get them to reflect.</p>

        <p>Yeah I may say that. I said to a few why are you wanting to give an experimental shot to kids, but they ignored me or changed the subject. The brainwashing is extreme out there.</p>

        <p>Yep. People either completely disregard what you’re saying or get angry at you. And although people have been conditioned, I believe it’s willful ignorance.</p>

        <p>I believe it's willful.I tried to talk to a few who refused to look at articles and links.Still remember the day two women I knew [from the community] wrote of having neuropathy like symptoms on Facebook from their first jab, and I went to go write them and told them to rethink the second dose and showed them websites like Covid Vaccinated and I was dismissed and told that was all lies and antivaxxers even though they themselves had harmful effects. That blew my mind. :'(</p>

        <p>I think this thing being "free" made people even more susceptible to making a quick, not well thought out  decision. One person I know drove someone else to get the vax. They said "I was already there so why not?"</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree, since it is "free" sure they will jack the price of the boosters later, they all lined up. I can see the boosters being in the hundreds or even thousands, later maybe even with student like loans to put you more in debt. Just thinking of the usual SOB tactics of our so called leaders.</p>
