    <strong>Does anyone know how many people in Italy died from influenza this year?</strong>
    <p><p>I can't find that data.  Each year they have quite a few influenza deaths.  The number has even been as high as just over 30,000 people and that's in recent history.  Each flu season the hospitals get overrun and there are a lot of fatalities.  This year, the data is missing.  All I can find is an article that states that 31,000 (approximate) people have died due to "covid-19" related issues.  That's the official number there- The media was saying that it was the worst thing in history and that they've never seen anything like it, but that's a typical flu season for them.</p>
<p>So where are the influenza deaths?  Why isn't the media giving us a count that's double what a typical year would be?    </p>
<p>Now, it's true that they could have simply had a mild year, but there's another article put out in January stating that half a million people were struck down in one week by influenza.  Half a million people in one week were KOed by influenza but none of them died from it?</p></p>

        <p>I'm from italy  and i didn't find such data.</p>
<p>It's highly probable that that data went directly into the covid ones, and we'll never know.</p>
<p>Plus you should consider also dozens of thousands deaths every year for generical infection in the hospital (best healthcare in the world, indeed), and for medical mistakes.</p>
<p>How they would be able to give us these data? I don't know</p>

        <p>I know theres a website for European flu data, but its confusing for me to navigate. I don't know if they have any data on the Italy by itself but here it is:</p>

        <p>That will probably never be known for 2020.  In the before times critically ill people arenâ€™t always tested for influenza let alone when all hell breaks loose and they canâ€™t admit all the people that need medical help into the hospital.</p>

        <p>The more probable story is that the number of people admitted for covid 19 symptoms were mixed with flu. </p>
<p>I mean...  donâ€™t you think that double the typical flu year would have made the headlines? Name me one MSM network that would have passed on a 60,000 to 70,000 death count from a combination of covid and flu in Italy. Name one.  </p>
<p>Italy was under a VERY heavy microscope this year yet 460,000+ people falling ill with influenza magically changes to 31,000 people dying of covid with no influenza count at all?  </p>
<p>Something is very wrong here.</p>

        <p>I think the headlines in Italy in March were about old people being turned away from hospitals because they had to triage their resources.   That was the main thing. </p>
<p>I donâ€™t live in the US.  But in Canada starting every fall there are articles about Influenza numbers.  Itâ€™s a hot topic ever since H1N1 influenza.  I can say for certain that if influenza deaths had doubled here last year it would have been a big deal here.  But thatâ€™s just here. </p>
<p>When Wuhan locked their citizens into their city and some of them into their buildings this new virus definitely became the more compelling news story over influenza ðŸ’¯</p>
