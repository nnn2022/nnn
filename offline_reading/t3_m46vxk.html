    <p><p>How is this even ok?
You're not supposed to ask about religion or sexual orientation or political representation but this is ok?</p>
<p>This is getting out of hand.</p></p>

        <p>I'm not okay with this and wouldn't like it in my workplace. I'm female and comfortable with that. I'm a little <em>un</em>comfortable with the idea of calling constant conscious attention to it. Performance is what matters, not my gender, and I already had to overcome some mildly negative stereotypes. "I AM A WOMAN, SEE, CALL ME SHE AND HER" is not conducive to creating a more gender-blind workplace where people are judged solely by their behavior and performance.</p>

        <p>I just remember when  I was management,  we never would ask anything personal. 
Are you married,  do you have kids what's your religion ect ect.
The purpose was to avoid stereotypes and bias decisions because that information was never relevant to being with. 
If you're qualified for the job and do it well why are we discussing anything but business?</p>

        <p>We just need to bring back the word "hit".  It's pronounced "it" with the H being silent. It was the 1930s word for a singular gender neutral pronoun. It was the singular version of "they". </p>
<p>It fell out of use because people didn't like the sound of being called objects.  "Oh that belonged to hit, but hit left already."</p>
<p>I say we bring it back and when these gender neutral people complain about being referred to as "it", we can simply say we're using the old 1930s word.</p>

        <p>They also had segregated water fountains, a great depression, and domestic abuse was common. 
But sure, be homophobic instead of just using they/them. But in the slight chance you didn't know that was an option, I know another word used in the 30s to describe you.</p>

        <p>Because it literally is comparing someone to an object. And the argument "they did it back then" doesn't work since they also used racial slurs constantly in the 30s. So the same reason it's racist to call people racial slurs. It feel outta style for a reason, and it was 100 years ago for a reason. Things tend to change 100 years later, and if they don't they usually die off.</p>

        <p>"no it literally isn't" isn't even a valid argument. Your original statement isn't even correct. A quick Google search shows the word was "thon" a contraction of that one. There's no information about referring to gender neutral people as "hit/it" outside of being homophobic. Your argument is horrible, and at the end of the day just homophobic. 
Tldr: So yes, you're being very homophobic and your argument isnt even correct, your best argument is "no it's not" so I refuse to engage with you further.</p>

        <p>Okay cool the word existed in even older times when they had public executions and everyone listened to kings. You're not actually addressing any of the claims I mentioned. The only thing you addressed was the word was used. Another word that was used in the past was the n word, and the f slur. And while they used to be socially acceptable to say a hundred years ago, they aren't now. And for good reasons.
And saying your claim is valid because it was a long time ago is idiotic, considering they used to believe draining blood was a cure all and that the sun revolved around the earth.
Seriously, I'm done replying to your idiocy, and I hate the waiting period. At this point just DM me and if you actually have an argument and not just saying "nuh uh" then I'll reply.</p>

        <p>It's still homophobic. Are you non-binary or prefer gender neutral pronouns? Cuz I know damn well if someone called some of my best friends "hit" (pronounced like it) then just said "idc I'mma say whatever I want" they'd be pretty pissed, and probably kick your ass. Cuz the 30s were 90 years ago for a reason, homophobic bullshit and idiocracy like the stuff spewing from you needs to die off. 
The argument wasn't if you cared or not, it's if the phrase was homophobic. And as a cishet dude, I'm very positive you never had to deal with homophobia. Your opinion is shit, your an idiot, and Darwinism will quickly do away with your pitiful existence.</p>

        <p>Idk, as an LGBTQ person would I know what that word means? Cuz if you think calling people it is okay you don't know what general decency is. You still have no argument!!! And you're just a snowflake (I hate using that word but I feel you'd say it unironically so I really wanna get under your skin) that can't argue and resorts to blocking. Honestly I see it as an honor to be blocked by homophobes.</p>

        <p>Pfff I put pronouns on my linked in page a long time ago. Also, I am thinking of coming out as non-binary to HR soon. I am married so I really have nothing to lose from telling the world 'i am a non-binary queer in a straght-passing relationship'.</p>
<p>Lots of places now struggle from finding qualified 'diverse candidates'. Nobody really want to decrease the quality of output, but look, if you have 0 qualified queer applicants what would you do? One bank in Switzerland increased womens representation on the board by converting one board member into a woman. It took her wearing lipstick 2 days a week. Not a big sacrifice, and she even got a prize for smashing glass ceiling in the corporate world.</p>

<p>So coming out as non-binary pronoun-aware indivudual will make recruiter's radar's ring. There aren't really many diverse candidates with my experience.</p>
<p>I wish I could do something about my race too. I am watching Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor closely. If he can be black &amp; marginalized, so can many of us.</p>

        <p>They're pushing this so hard they're trying to make this a thing. I see on friends social media they now write he/his or she/her on top, but that's what they were always referred to as so 1% of the population might want to be called something else so the other 99% have to walk around and make it be known that we're men or women to strangers. </p>

        <p>The way the social norms are nowadays, I agree, it absolutely isn't out of line, but that doesn't change the fact that it's absolutely ridiculous to even consider it an issue. I mean, after all, you are what you are and people will generally classify you as such. If you don't like it, it is up to you to change their perception by changing your appearance or whatever to change the way they see you. That's the way I see it, anyways.</p>

        <p>Compelled speech is totally normal now. Before things were like 'don't say these things and there won't be any trouble'. Now it's 'say this things and there won't be any trouble'</p>
<p>The list of things you have to say is only expected to grow.</p>
<p>Most constitutions outlaw complelled speech, but we know that constitution is a systemically opressive thing that was written by imperfect men and has to be dismantled.</p>

        <p>Calling someone a Miss instead of Mrs won't constitute hate speech. Also there's Ms, if you choose not to care about your interlocutor's marital status. </p>
<p>Misgendering someone is hate speech, according to Canadian Bill C-16.</p>
<p>If it wasn't difficult or a big deal, they wouldn't be throwing people jail for it. Also, weirdly enough, gay people never complained if you assumed them being straight. Gay people of 1970s mostly just wanted to be left alone, they didn't want to reshape and recenter society to validate them. Gay identity exists independently of what I think or say, but gender identity involves the whole society to participate in gender validation. If gender is not validated by society, it does not exist. Sexuality is within, but gender is indeed a societal construct, therefore we need bills like C-16 to support it.</p>
