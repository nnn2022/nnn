        <p>&rt; They’re being selfish, no matter how you look at it. </p>
<p>Actually they care about their health and you are reckless and irresponsible to compel people to damage their health with the habit of facemasking. That "piece of fabric" is worse than smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p><em>Dyspnea variation was significantly higher with surgical mask</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/</a></p>
<p><em>Ventilation, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and comfort are reduced by surgical masks and highly impaired by FFP2/N95 face masks in healthy individuals.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338098/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338098/</a></p>
<p><em>Wearing an N95 mask significantly reduced the PaO2 level (101.7 +/- 12.6 to 92.7 +/- 15.8 mm Hg, p = 0.006), increased the respiratory rate (16.8 +/- 2.8 to 18.8 +/- 2.7/min, p &lt; 0.001), and increased the occurrence of chest discomfort (3 to 11 patients, p = 0.014) and respiratory distress (1 to 17 patients, p &lt; 0.001).</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15340662/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15340662/</a></p>
<p><em>Irritant contact dermatitis was common on the cheeks and nasal bridge due to pressure and friction. Irritant dermatitis was associated with personal history of atopic dermatitis and prolonged mask wear (&rt;6 hours)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33011325/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33011325/</a></p>
<p><em>Respiratory pathogens on the outer surface of the used medical masks may result in self-contamination. The risk is higher with longer duration of mask use (&rt; 6 h) and with higher rates of clinical contact.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159777/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159777/</a></p>
<p>And other side effects affecting the heart</p>
<p>Inconsistent breathing, even slight, profoundly affects heart rate variability (HRV) And breathing constantly through masks certainly affect HRV. Read more here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311559/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311559/</a></p>
<p>Also with respect to environment</p>
<p><em>...disposable face masks (single use) that get to the environment (disposal in landfill, dumpsites, freshwater, oceans or littering at public spaces) could be emerging new source of microplastic fibers, as they can degrade/fragment or break down into smaller size/pieces of particles under 5 mm known as microplastics under environmental conditions. The Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis (see Supporting Information for details) of the degrading face masks (</em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/figure/f0015/"><em>Fig. 3</em></a> <em>) was carried out using PerkinElmer, UATR Two, USA, against a plastic specific spectral library (Perkin Elmer ATR of Polymers Library). The spectra showed a characteristic peaks of a polypropylene for the outer layer (</em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/figure/f0015/"><em>Fig. 3</em></a><em>a) and polyethylene high density for the inner layer (</em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/figure/f0015/"><em>Fig. 3</em></a><em>b). The spectra provide a piece of evidence that face masks could increase the accumulation of their related microparticles in the environment within a short time.</em></p>
<p><em>Another implication of this indiscriminately disposed face masks in the environment is the possibility of acting as a medium for disease outbreak, as plastic particles are known to propagate microbes such as invasive pathogens</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/"><em>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/</em></a></p>
<p>Plus the various elements in a mask</p>
<p><strong><em>Polyester</em></strong> <em>is a synthetic fabric that derives from petroleum, which essentially makes polyester a byproduct of oil. For the consumer, the issue with this fabric is that it doesn’t breathe as natural fibers do, which means that your sweat can’t evaporate, which is uncomfortable and can cause acne and rashes. For the environment, the consequences are even greater as polyester is not naturally broken down, which is a big problem as it continues to fill our landfills and oceans.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Neoprene</em></strong> <em>(wetsuit fabric) is a synthetic fabric. The North American Contact Dermatitis Group performed 10 years of research into neoprene allergy, and found that sensitive individuals can develop allergic reactions ranging from simple redness to painful blisters. For many people, the only way to avoid a reaction is to avoid the product.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Acrylics</em></strong> <em>can be found in anything from sweaters to masks. The issue with acrylics is that they contain</em> <strong><em>dimethylformamide</em></strong>*, a chemical known to cause liver damage. This chemical is so potent that the people who manufacture acrylic fibers have to wear protective gloves just to touch the clothing they are making.*</p>
<p><strong><em>Conventional Cotton</em></strong>*: We tend to think of cotton as a “natural” fabric, which to a certain extent it is. While cotton is grown from the ground and not in a lab, the cotton used in the fashion industry is usually still treated with a concerning amount of toxic chemicals. Typically cotton that is used in textiles is treated with pesticides, colored with toxic dyes, and treated with chemical coatings in order to give clothing the bright and shiny effects that consumers are drawn to. And while we all may love the convenience of having a wrinkle-free dress, all of those added chemicals make this “natural” fiber anything but natural.*</p>
<p><strong><em>Azo dyes</em></strong> <em>are common synthetic dyes used for coloring clothes, leather, and textiles. These dyes contain amines, which have been shown to increase the risk of bladder cancer in dye factory workers and hairdressers. The next time you’re looking for a dress in your favorite color, try reaching for a product with organic dyes to avoid these toxic effects.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Phthalates</em></strong> <em>are a fast fashion favorite. They are used in waterproof clothing, so think raincoats and leather. These phthalates are known “endocrine disruptors” that have been linked to both male and female reproductive issues because they interfere with how hormones communicate with our bodies.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Nanosilver</em></strong> <em>is an antimicrobial agent used to treat a wide variety of medical equipment, including gloves and face masks. Some research has already found that silver nanoparticles can kill brain cells in exposed rodents. There is also a concern that this risk may apply to humans as well, but lack of research has made it determine what level of exposure is considered dangerous and what the long term effects could be.</em></p>
<p><em>Anything that advertises itself as</em> <strong><em>static resistant, stain-resistant, flame retardant or wrinkle-free</em></strong> <em>develops these properties by being treated with formaldehyde, nonylphenol ethoxylates, or triclosan. These chemicals are absorbable through the skin and have been associated with reproductive and developmental effects in rodents, and potentially in humans as well.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Formaldehyde</em></strong> <em>has also been associated with skin reactions and nasopharyngeal cancer and is a likely culprit for facial dermatitis that is being seen in healthcare workers required to wear face masks all day while at work. Studies on factory workers who are exposed to triclosan suggest that regular exposure may contribute to increased cancer risk.</em></p>
<p><em>Despite these known effects of these chemicals, there is no regulation for the number of chemicals that can be used in products sold in the United States or a requirement for brands to report which chemicals are used in their clothing.</em></p>

        <p>It isn't about you.  Wearing masks is detrimental to developing brains that need to see faces to learn emotions, learn speech/diction, feel loved and welcome, etc.  Wearing masks in the presence of young children, toddlers, infants is destructive to their brains and lives.  You're a horrible selfish person for not even thinking about the impact it has on children everywhere.  The so called "follow the science" zealots?  They're just full of hate and ignorant of the impact they're having on the world.</p>
