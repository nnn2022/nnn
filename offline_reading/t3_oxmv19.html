    <strong>The secret Covenant. Look it up, it’s the reality we live in</strong>
    <p><p>They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn.   The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will feed them more poison.  The poisons will be absorbed trough their skin and mouths, they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems.  From all this, their children will be born dead, and we will conceal  this information.  The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them, in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear.   We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons for they can see far.   We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images and musical tones.  Those they look up to will help. We will enlist them to  push our poisons.  They will see our products being used in film and will grow accustomed to them and will never know their true effect.  When they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood of their children and convince them its for their help.  We will start early on, when their minds are young, we will target their children with what children love most, sweet things.   When their teeth decay we will fill them with metals that will kill their mind and steal their future………….</p>
<p>We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend.  The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers. They will be busy killing each other.  They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long  as we see fit……..</p>
<p>We will recruit some of their own to carry out our plans, we will promise them  eternal life, but eternal life they will never have for they are not of us.  The recruits will be called "initiates" and will be indoctrinated to believe false rites of passage to higher realms. Members of  these groups will think they are one with us never knowing the truth. They must never learn this truth for they will turn against us.  For their work they will be rewarded with earthly things and great titles, but never will they become immortal and join us, never will they receive the light and travel the stars……</p>
<p>If they ever find out that together they can vanquish us, they will take action.  They must never, ever find out what we have done, for if they do, we shall have no place to run, for it will be easy to see who we are once the veil has fallen. Our actions will have revealed who we are and they will hunt us down and no person shall give us shelter.  This is the secret covenant</p></p>
