    <strong>How do you cope with loneliness, both socially &amp; romantically?</strong>
    <p><p>And knowing that because of this lockdown shit, you’re going to likely be lonely for the rest of your life because you’ll be fighting against hordes of NPCs, if not the Gestapo of TPTB themselves. Knowing that you missed out on rituals 99% of your peers go through (first love, crazy friendship adventures, losing virginity) &amp; you’re never going to be able to go through them because you’ll be too busy fighting against the system that’s trying to kill you? Knowing that the people that can give you these experiences will instead try to turn you into a “cancelled” unperson. Knowing that they’re all really fucking psychotic narcissistic bullying sociopaths, but you have to kiss their ass to get along in society. Knowing that people now are going to be so fucking flaky that anything you do with them is fucking irrelevant the moment you leave their presence, &amp; that they give so little fucks about you you could not text them for decades &amp; they wouldn’t text or call you? How tf do you cope?</p></p>

        <p>I sympathize with you-feeling left out from gatherings (if theres masks-more like rituals) but, hopping on some of the other comments-there are people out there like you and you will find each other soon enough. And people who think alike tend to find one another eventually. This may come off as some corny new age stuff but I feel we tend to attract what we put out. If anything I feel these bonds will be stronger than what we all miss of the before times. And though we may find ourselves battling in a new paradigm there is still room for love, understanding, acceptance, and compassion. You will find it or it will find you. You are very much not alone. </p>
<p>I've been battling with suicide long before this abhorrent year and though it seems more appealing to just duck out of this-I will be damned if I give up one more chance to fall in love, foster a new friendship, or salvage an old one. Bc that would mean I would've given in to this disgusting attempt at culling the population. They've filled me with too much spite to give them an easy point.</p>
<p>The other comments said it better than I could: spring brings new beginnings.</p>

        <p>I’m an introvert.  My life hasn’t changed all that much since this stupid shit began.   My advice would be: get a cat.   Cute, snuggly, and low maintenance.</p>
