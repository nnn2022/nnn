    <strong>Bill Gates being the poster boy for covid vaccines + Epstein</strong>
    <p><p>I think we should start pressuring him with his eugenics obsessrd father and his relationship with a convicted child rapist and known trafficker. The media is doing it on purpose because they know this covid shit is obvious. They know we know people in positions of power are blackmailed and criminal. </p>
<p>If they ever had to admit fault they'd blame Bill Gates and say he was carrying out his father's plan or something. There was a MSM segment on Bill Gates before covid was even big so there's a reason they picked him. Had him predict it. Maybe this will open peoples eyes. Of course they will say it was him and a few others not a global conspiracy but this would be a win. This would be them backing down for a little bit and scrapping those vax ports</p></p>
