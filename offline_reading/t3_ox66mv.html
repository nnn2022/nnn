        <p>FIRST SECTION:</p>
<p>Me in Warehouse, walking from the bathroom, to confront Leaders over the situation. I tell them that based on my Love for Publix, its Ideas, and its People, and what I stand for, I cannot simply put this mask back on to earn money.</p>
<p>I make a joke by offering them the mask back, because I am certain that I would be allowed to proceed to work with it on even after man handling the mask.</p>
<p>SECOND PART:</p>
<p>after listening to me walk into the office of the managers, hear Greenwise Tallahassee Manager Justin's reasoning for the Mask Employee mandate. Notice that there is no preset speech detailing any COVID numbers, no Respect for an employees beliefs, him even saying that he hopes I change my mind.</p>
<p>Change my mind to get a job back? Losing a job for difference of opinion?</p>
<p>LAST PART:</p>
<p>I am not sad at all for making this move. Walking into that Greenwise and seeing every single employee whos happy faces I once admired, slap on a mask and walk about like an emotionless drone stocking shelves, was the most tragic thing I had ever witnessed. I don't regret this decision in the slightest, and I hope the blows reverberations are felt profoundly:</p>
<p>For every person that reads this post, for myself, and for everyone that ever Remembers me, James Rodriguez.</p>
<p>To see individuals so willingly give up their identity for a paycheck, is a tragedy to me.</p>
<p>Me quitting my job on 8-2, a month after being employed, at a great company meant to serve people, less than 10 miles from De-Santis- mansion.</p>
<p>Employees were so happy to be back to normal, no masking either for the customers or the staff, for the majority of the year.</p>
<p>Then, the CDC flips the tables again, ping ponging the public to catastrophy as they still can't seem to make up their mind over whether or not the cloth slapped on your face really helps</p>
<p>But do you think they'd really tell us, even if they were to make discoveries pointing toward the realization that it DOESN'T?</p>
<p>No. Which is why I quit my job now, and refuse to work in another establishment that has any opinion on the subject of Free Will, other than allowing people their Free will. What a shame that Florida, being the PINNACLE of COVID handling, would allow this in its CAPITAL.</p>
