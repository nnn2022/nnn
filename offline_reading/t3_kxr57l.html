    <strong>What would happen if I stopped paying business taxes? (In Canada)</strong>
    <p><p>Tempted.
I’d stop collecting HST and wouldnt remit anything my business owes to government.
I don’t support where our taxes go. Think how much was spent on vaccines, media alerts about covid, and just in general too.</p></p>

        <p>Im not sure about the laws in Canada but I would assume it’s be the same as defying any government.</p>
<p>Stop paying taxes, they fine you for it.</p>
<p>Don’t pay fine, they fine you more.</p>
<p>Still don’t pay, they issue arrest warrant with intention of attaching your wages. Will probably also just go to your bank for the funds. Banks will not protect your money from the government for taxation and will hand over your cash.</p>
<p>Refuse to go along with what the court says, get sent to prison and subjected to violence and rape from other prisoners.</p>
<p>Or resist arrest as not to even go to court and get shot.</p>
<p>The state, government, always results in violence.</p>
