<title>How many people do you think would still be alive if they hadn't been put on a ventilator? If they had been given Ivermectin? If they hadn't been told that masks were perfectly capable of stopping an airborne virus? If they hadn't been stuck inside for months on end? If they hadn't taken the vax?</title>

    <strong>How many people do you think would still be alive if they hadn't been put on a ventilator? If they had been given Ivermectin? If they hadn't been told that masks were perfectly capable of stopping an airborne virus? If they hadn't been stuck inside for months on end? If they hadn't taken the vax?</strong>
    <p><p>All of the medical advice and procedures throughout this "pandemic" have been ass-backwards and have actively contributed to the death rates. The fact that Ivermectin was scoffed at and buried just because Trump endorsed it is fucking disgusting if you ask me. How many people might have lived if their fucking doctor had just given them that? "OH NO, pEoPLe mIgHt tHinK i'M a rEpUbLiCaN!" Fuck you for putting politics above your patients.</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to build up old people's confidence by telling them over and over again how fucking perfect masks were, how they would protect them and keep them safe from a fucking airborne virus when there are multiple studies out there that say the exact fucking opposite. As you so often like to screech: IT'S A FUCKING PIECE OF CLOTH AND FABRIC.</p>
<p>If you ask me putting people on ventilators probably fucking ended up killing a lot of folks who would have otherwise survived. Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought you only put someone on a ventilator if they're about to die and it's just to give them more time so their loved ones could come say goodbye. How fucking cruel is it then that they denied their friends and family from visiting them on their death-beds.</p>
<p>I've been told my whole life that fresh air and a bit of sun is good for you, so how is it fucking good for our immune systems to be cooped up inside twenty four fucking seven then? The least they could have done is encouraged people to take vitamins. Not to mention the toll this has taken on people's mental health; how many people had to commit suicide for you to fucking feel safe?</p>
<p>Medical negligence and incompetence has been the real fucking killers during this "pandemic". The vaccine is just another part of it. We've all seen the videos, the VAERS reports, the posts on the CovidVaccinated subreddit... this is only the beginning. Long term side effects and ADE are still possible and I am fucking terrified honestly. I hope to fucking God we're all wrong but my gut tells me we're not.</p></p>

        <p>And as for combos:</p>
<p>Vitamin D + Calcium, for musculoskeletal and immune strength</p>
<p>Vitamin C + Zinc, for brain and  immune system boost</p>

        <p>Masks were useless, and were really just suggested because they were believed to serve as a visual reminder to socially distance. However, it seems to me that masks did the exact opposite of what they were intended to do, and actually encouraged people to not socially distance because they felt they'd be safe wearing a mask. </p>

        <p>The CDCs guidance on what to do if you test positive basically guaranteed the worst possible health outcome. They said that if you have a positive test you should go home and wait until you are experiencing difficulty breathing and then go to the hospital so they can strap a ventillator on your face. 80% death rate for any covid patient on a vent.</p>
<p>Funny how they didn't give any advice for treating the virus before going to the hospital to die on a ventilator.</p>

        <p>I agree with everything. Though I don't know enough about ventilators and I doubt you do either to make a conclusive argument on if they are bad or not.</p>
<p>However, ignoring all the alternative treatments that were brushed aside, what killed and harmed the most people wasn't covid and its long term effects, but losing their jobs, being isolated from friends and family, having to frugally live off of benefits, and the general destruction the economy. </p>
<p>Covid should've been let to run its course. Sure many would have died, but many people die from cars, it's statistically unlikely, even more so if you observe safety measures, but cars kill alot of people compared to other forms of transport, but we still use them, there is a good trade off between comfort/benefit of using a car and the risk involved. You could be killed at any moment any day from a stray lightning bolt or something else but you shouldn't let a statistical unlikelyhood rule you.</p>

        <p>Let me share a quick and personal story. My family and I own a food pantry (nonprofit). When covid hit our caseload went up by 500%+ because of the lock down and loss of jobs/income. For the entire year except one week between Christmas and New Year's, we served the public, giving groceries two days a week, and more. My husband was converted wfh. Many people where I live were poor prior to the pandemic so they couldn't afford masks. A tent city emerged and we served there as well. Don't focus on what I did - I saw easily 1000 people a week packing their cars with groceries, talking to them just trying to provide hope. I focused on my health, especially my mental health, eating well, not so much resting but def on my water, supps, running and exercising outside for the sun etc. The tent city had at its largest almost 350 people. No covid outbreak. None of us at the pantry got so much as a sniffle. And while I thank God for the extra protection - the point is we were outside. Essential and very much in contact with people. The overhype is completely by design and for nefarious purposes.</p>

        <p>It's wild. I'm not an anti-vaxer by any standards but this whole thing has opened my eyes. Now looking at the vaccine schedule for my little kids it kinda makes me wonder is this really what is best for my child, or is it just a money grab by doctors/hospitals to charge insurance and make a quick $200.</p>

        <p>Well it depends on whether you think the numbers are bullshit or not. Taking them at face value, based on the ivermectin effectiveness stats and ventilator mortality rates, several hundred thousand American lives could have been saved with early administration or prophylactic use of ivermectin and avoiding having a machine jammed down their throats. </p>

        <p>I don't think people have any idea of the reality we will be living through if the doctors reporting this lethality are right. Society will be in an upheaval. That many deaths and incapacities, every facet of life will be disrupted when there aren't enough able bodied people. Hospitals? Ambulance Drivers? Hell, garbage men and mail carriers. If the percentages are right on how many people got this thing, we could be witnessing a cataclysm both in terms of life but also the economy and society writ large</p>

        <p>1: Ivermectin isn't even an anti-viral, much less one that helps with covid. It wasn't scoffed at because Trump endorsed it, it was scoffed at because it doesn't work. Demanding it anyway, just because Trump endorsed it, despite doctors saying it's unsafe, is putting politics first, not the other way around. </p>
<p>2: No doctor has ever said masks were perfect at eliminating transmission. They said they were effective at <em>reducing</em> transmission rates. Covid is carried in aerosol, not directly in the air, which makes masks an effective countermeasure. </p>
<p>3: You are wrong about ventilators. Their purpose in this context is to keep you alive long enough for your natural immune system to kill the virus. If you're on a ventilator, the virus was gonna kill you anyway. With it, your body has a bit of extra time. You still have pretty bad odds, though, cause if you're at that point, you were already losing. </p>
<p>4: Vitamins won't help. Why would they help? Do you even know what vitamins are? Taking a vitamin won't help against covid any more than it would help you with a chopped off foot. You're complaining that doctors haven't been straight with you, then you complain they didn't bullshit you enough?</p>
<p>5: How are you gonna say covid isn't a big deal, but vaccine side effects terrify you? At this point, nearly half the country has gotten the vaccine, and according to the VAERS reports, only 6k people have died after receiving the vaccine. Not even <em>from</em> it, just after getting it. So even if there were no more covid deaths, and somehow we decided literally all of those deaths were from the vaccine, covid would still be 500x deadlier than the vaccine that treats it. Considering that the vast majority of those probably aren't from the vaccine, and that covid deaths are still rising, that 500x is probably a <em>lot</em> higher. </p>
<p>It's not your "gut" guiding you, it's your fear, and that fear has made you irrational. It has led you to trust people who are lying to you, and to ignore the people that are telling you the truth.</p>

<p>In the early days of covid, when nobody knew what was going on, people likely did get put on ventilators before it was absolutely necessary, because it was impossible to know when "absolutely necessary" actually was. But they were <em>not</em> used simply so the patient could die slower. Severe covid can make it harder to breathe, sometimes to the point where it becomes impossible without help, ventilators do the work of breathing for you, which gives your body some extra time to fight.</p>

        <p>Ivermectin wasn't used much outside the US either, so myabe its not because of that.</p>
<p>There might be studies that claim that masks dont effect spread, but there the ones that show that they have an effect  as well. If nothing else, even you and I can agree without medical expertise that spittle and relatively large particles are stopped by any kind of physical blockage in front of the mouth.</p>
<p>I agree that your government should have advised  people to get vitamins, but people mostly dont develop life threatening comlications with lungs because they sit cooped up somewhere.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for all the people who died from suicide, but don't use this arguement. That way you either validate people saying "how many people had to die just so me/you/her could get coffee", or you will look hypocritical.</p>
<p>The passage about ventilators immediately starts with assumptions, I'm not a medical expert so Ill refrain from guessing what is their exact purpose in medicine. But yes, for some people, maybe a ventilator was a bad decision, but for others it was not. Many people made a recovery only because of mechanicaly assisted breathing. The usage of which is up to individual doctors to decide. The government doesn't have a law of putting people on ventilators when they drop below certain oxygen saturation.</p>
<p>The long term guesses about the vaccine are mostly guesses. Its been out for months now, and been tested for sometime before that. I trust that people who develope and test medicine know what they are doing. But that's just me.</p>

<p>Maybe they protect themselves as much as they can, byt they catch it from non compromised people that did take more risks. That's the trouble with disease, its contagious.</p>

<p>Why don't you point out all other medicine developed over time that didnt induce brith defects.</p>
<p>&rt;Our immune systems are getting weaker by being cooped inside and sanitizing fucking everything.</p>
<p>So now that you know tha vitamin D deficiency is bad, what is the problem here? Also, regular immunty is against pathogens you already encountered. Strong immune system doesnt imply protection against covid.</p>

<p>Are you implying that ling scarring is worse than death?</p>
<p>&rt;Why not? If it showed promise in fighting Covid then surely it should have been used in other countries</p>
<p>Then maybe it didnt show promise? 
Also, its always about big pharma out to get us, but any medicine for covid is perfectly fine except the vaccines.</p>

<p>If they're out getting coffee they're not "protecting themselves as much as they can", are they? You can order anything to your house these days (if we couldn't there's no way this farce could have gone on as long as it fucking has).</p>

<p>Fucking... what? Dude.</p>
<p>&rt;Are you implying that ling scarring is worse than death?</p>
<p>I don't know what "ling scarring" is but I was pointing out that perhaps the ventilators were responsible for killing people who would otherwise have survived, and if all or most of those who DID survive the ventilators had lung scarring then this would back my theory up.</p>
<p>&rt;Then maybe it didnt show promise? Also, its always about big pharma outto get us, but any medicine for covid is perfectly fine except thevaccines.</p>
<p>It did, though. I would trust medicine that has been around for years over something that's been shat out after six months or so of rushed, sloppy testing. Go shill for the vaccine somewhere else.</p>

<p>I specifically meant by protecting themselves that they werent out getting coffee in this argument. You missed that point.</p>
<p>&rt;I dont think you udnerstand how an argument works
I was implying that statistcally more medicine is developed right than not. Do you have a right for concern? Always. Does it mean that it's statisically supported? Not always.</p>
<p>&rt;Strong immune system doesnt imply protection against covid.</p>
<p>Strength of an immune system makes sense when speaking against pathogens your body already came into contact. Like herpes for example. When the response to HERPES is strong, then it doesnt appear, when the immunity drops due to  stress or malnourishment, that's when those lesions on lips start showing. Against a disease with no experience, strength of existing responses doesnt directly translate.</p>
<p>&rt;I don't know what "ling scarring" is but I was pointing out that perhaps the ventilators were responsible for killing people who would otherwise have survived, and if all or most of those who DID survive the ventilators had lung scarring then this would back my theory up.</p>
<p>Lung scarring, sorry for the typo. I understand what you are pointing out, but doctors put people on mechanicaly assisted breathing only when death without  it is certain. No one makes that decision lightly. Second part of my argument still stands, I think lung scarring is better than death in people who survived. Not to mention its mostly covif that causes the scarring, not the ventilation procedure.</p>
<p>&rt;It did, though. I would trust medicine that has been around for years over something that's been shat out after six months or so of rushed, sloppy testing. Go shill for the vaccine somewhere else.</p>
<p>The crux of this argument is that time is the sole proof that medicine is safe. How much is that time?
Also, by this time, the whole world has been your lab rat. Vaccines are statistcally safer then contracting the disease itself. Also, what part of the testing was sloppy?</p>
