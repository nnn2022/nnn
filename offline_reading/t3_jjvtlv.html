        <p>&rt;Here is one case in hundreds over this year, when hastily reviewed papers with simple errors drive media frenzies that feed directly into political outcomes, paradigmatic cases in which the appearance of science overrides the real thing in ways that injure the rights and liberties of people.</p>

        <p>To be clear:</p>
<p>This paper with clear errors in it was published, but the DANMASK study is being blacklisted.</p>
<p>Masks totally work.  That's why we can't prove it.</p>

        <p>Someone please take a look at the Kansas mask study referenced in the NY Times a couple days ago.  It feels off to me, and I'm wondering if it relies on those bad charts from July-ish (don't remember the dates exactly - the ones where info was presented misleadingly in reference to two different y-axes) in some way.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time, we believed our “health experts”. We believed our doctors when they said “vaccines are safe and effective”. We believed our government was trying to protect us. </p>
<p>And then..... 2020 happened. </p>
<p>And now we see. Our health experts work for Big Pharma. Not the people. They will manipulate science for whatever suits their agenda. They will silence and censor anyone that does not agree with them. They will rewrite history to manipulate the minds of people. They will make up new pathogens to spread fear and compliance in the population for the purpose of removing our freedoms. They’ve bought our government officials. They own the MSM.  They are here to make us slaves to the medical system. To own our minds. To control our thoughts. To force us into medical slavery. </p>
<p>The current age of book burning is upon us. Anything contrary to the narrative is being destroyed. Anyone that speaks out is attacked. </p>
<p>“Trust the science” is the heart of the scam. The science is an illusion of fact wrapped in the loins of fiction. Humanity is not a disease.  Hollywood can no longer manipulate us into thinking mankind has the power to unleash a deadly virus on the world. It’s fiction plagiarizing as fact. It’s not true. We would have no control over a real virus. As soon as it was released, no one could anticipate what would happen or who would get sick. It could disappear in a day. It could mutate so rapidly that we couldn’t test for it. The science is so incomplete that I don’t think they even know how to create a virus. But because of Hollywood, most of us accept it as already having happened. No, a fake virus can do whatever you say it can do. You control the narrative. You control the story. And you have a test that will keep the virus alive as long as you are testing. </p>
<p>This is just another example of false info being accepted in the record of truth.  Until modern medicine accepts that our minds have more of an effect on our physical health than anything else, we will constantly be herded into medical slavery. That’s the only way this works. This is all about making money. This isn’t about morals or keeping people healthy. This is about medical slavery. Controlling our minds. Forcing us into a lifetime of sickness so someone can make a buck off of our suffering. The elite see us a goyim. Slaves. Parasites. We are here to serve them. We don’t deserve to be happy and healthy. We deserve slavery and the medical system is the tool of destruction and control. </p>
<p>We must stop this. We must stand up and take our lives back. We must say “no more”. We are the 99%. We are the power. We are only controlled and manipulated because we allow it. We have to wake up and create the world we all desire where love and light prevail. We can no longer live only worried about ourselves and our next paycheck. We must come together as one unit and bring in the age of prosperity for those that deserve it. We must put the parasites of our existence in their place. It’s only a matter of time. How much suffering will we endure before we say “ENOUGH”!!!</p>
