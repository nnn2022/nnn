<p>From the article, because the hell if I'm going to give the Daily Mail ad revenue:  </p>
<p>&rt;India's health system is collapsing as Covid variant sweeps country: Gravediggers burn piles of victims to keep up and crematorium furnaces MELT due to round-the-clock use<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- More than 200,000 cases per day recorded on average in the last week, 20 times as many as two months ago<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- UK banned travel from India Monday but acted 'weeks too late' as more than 100 in Britain have Indian strain<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- Boris Johnson to answer questions tonight over why 900 people per day allowed to flow into UK from India <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- New Indian Covid-19 variant has two mutations which scientists fear could enable it to evade vaccines<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- This B.1.617 variant is believed to spread more easily and could potentially be more lethal than other strains<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- Medics across India say patients are significantly younger than in first wave, with two thirds under-45 in Delhi<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- Young people experiencing 'increased severity' doctors say, particularly on their lungs, heart and kidneys <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- Delhi imposed week-long lockdown as city of 29 million struggles with fewer than 150 beds for critical care<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;- Across India crematoria have been working around the clock, cracking chimneys and melting iron frames</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>&rt;India's health system is collapsing under the fastest spreading coronavirus surge since the pandemic started, with gravediggers burning piles of bodies and crematorium furnaces melting from round-the-clock use.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Another 259,170 cases were recorded on Tuesday, the world's highest daily rate, and 1,761 deaths, the country's highest ever daily toll, after a new variant of Covid emerged which scientists fear could partly evade vaccines.  <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Britain added India to its 'red list' on Monday but was accused of acting weeks too late as more than 100 people in the UK have now tested positive for this Indian variant since the end of March, most traced to foreign travel.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Boris Johnson will tonight hold a press conference to answer mounting questions over why some 900 people were able to arrive from India every day for the last three weeks, while Britons have been banned from overseas travel to stop the spread. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Another 5,000 people are due to flow from India into Britain before the travel ban comes into effect on Friday amid a desperate scramble to dodge quarantine.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;They risk carrying with them variant B.1.617 which is believed to spread more easily and could even be more lethal than other strains, with Indian doctors concerned by a significant proportion of young patients. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Some doctors say the reason that under-45s are now vulnerable is that they go to work and eat out more, but there is no definitive proof. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;At the start of the year, India thought it had beaten the pandemic and had kicked off a mass vaccination drive.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Face masks and social distancing were cast aside and huge crowds flocked to religious festivals, election rallies and cricket matches.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;But in its hospitals, short of oxygen, ventilators and beds, doctors started warning that they were becoming overwhelmed, including by a new phenomenon - younger patients. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Medics in Delhi say that two thirds of their new patients are under-45, while in Mumbai, doctors say that they are seeing children aged 12 to 15, where there were virtually no child admissions in the first wave.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;One Gujarat hospital has set up the state's first paediatric coronavirus ward.  <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;'We are also seeing children under the ages of 12 and 15 being admitted with symptoms in the second wave. Last year there were practically no children,' said Khusrav Bajan, a consultant at Mumbai's P.D. Hinduja National Hospital and a member of Maharashtra's Covid-19 taskforce.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In Gujarat state, pulmonologist Amit Dave said young people were experiencing 'increased severity' from coronavirus for their lungs, hearts and kidneys.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In the southern IT hub of Bangalore, under-40s made up 58 percent of infections in early April, up from 46 percent last year.   <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It is believed the under-45s may also be more prone to a new 'double mutant' variant found in 60 percent of samples in Maharashtra, the hardest-hit state.  </p>

<p>&rt;On Monday, the health ministry announced it will roll-out vaccines to over-18s from the start of next month, but it is unclear whether the country of 1.4 billion, which is the world's biggest vaccine producer, has anywhere near the supplies it needs, raising concerns for supply chains to the rest of the world.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Delhi, a city of 29 million, last night imposed a week-long lockdown to protect its buckling hospitals with fewer than 100 beds available with ventilators, and fewer than 150 beds for patients needing critical care.  <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In the western state of Gujarat, crematoria in Surat, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Ahmedabad are operating around the clock with three to four times more bodies than normal.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The chimney of one electric furnace in Ahmedabad cracked and collapsed after being in constant use for up to 20 hours every day for the past two weeks.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The iron frames inside another in the industrial diamond hub of Surat melted because there was no time to let the furnaces cool.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;'Until last month we were cremating 20-odd bodies per day... But since the beginning of April we have been handling over 80 bodies every day,' said a local official at the Ramnath Ghela Crematorium in the city. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;With waiting times of up to eight hours, Rajkot has set up a dedicated 24/7 control room to manage the flow in the city's four crematoria.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;At two crematoria in Lucknow in the north, relatives are being given numbered tokens and made to wait for up to 12 hours. One has started burning bodies in an adjacent park.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Rohit Singh, whose father died from Covid-19, said crematorium officials were charging around 7,000 rupees (£67) - almost 20 times the normal rate.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Some crematoria in Lucknow ran out of wood and asked people to bring it themselves. Viral photos on social media showed electric rickshaws laden down with logs.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The rising death toll has also increased the grim workload for gravediggers dramatically in the last few weeks. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;When AFP visited the Jadid Qabristan Ahle cemetery in the Indian capital - which is now in a week-long lockdown - on Friday, 11 bodies arrived within three hours.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; By sunset, 20 bodies were in the ground. This compares to some days in December and January, when his earthmoving machine stayed idle and when many thought the pandemic was over. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;'Now, it looks like the virus has legs,' said Shamim, 38, a gravedigger like his father and grandfather. 'At this rate, I will run out of space in three or four days.'<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Around the graveyard, white body bags or coffins made out of cheap wood are carried around by people in blue or yellow protective suits and lowered into graves.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Just months after India thought it had seen the worst of the pandemic, the virus is now spreading at a rate faster than at any other time, said Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan who has been tracking infections in India. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Delhi recorded 25,000 new coronavirus deaths and 161 deaths on Sunday, making it the worst affected city, with a virus positivity rate at almost 30 percent.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;One doctor told Sky News: 'If the situation is not brought under control soon, it will get so bad that people will die on footpaths for lack of oxygen.' <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Distressing scenes in the city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, reveal a similarly dire situation, with ambulances backed up down the street from the hospital and Covid patients attached to oxygen cylinders.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Reports show that not only are many hospitals running out of beds and hospitals, but also basic anti-viral medicines needed to keep people alive. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The country began inoculating health workers in mid-January and later extended the drive to people over 45. India has so far administered 120 million doses to its population of nearly 1.4 billion. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It has now recorded more than 15 million infections and more than 178,000 deaths. Experts agree that even these figures are likely under-reported. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Amid the rise in cases, Mr Johnson called off a trip to Delhi to hold post-Brexit trade talks with Narendra Modhi.  <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Indian variant, which was first detected in October 2020, is believed to be more infectious than the first strain of Covid.  <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Scientists suspect two mutations, named E484Q and L452R, help the variant to transmit faster and to get past immune cells made in response to older strains.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It carries the same E484Q mutation as the South African variant, believed to make vaccines about 30 per cent less effective at preventing severe reactions to the virus. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;However, Public Health England's Sharon Peacock has said there is limited evidence for this. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Indian variant is yet to be properly understood by scientists and has been classed as a 'variant under investigation', a tier below the Kent, South African and Brazilian variants, by the UK government. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Peacock also said the variant may not be the primary driver of the current wave of infections in India.  <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;She said: 'The question is whether this is associated with the variant, with human behaviour (for example, the presence of large gatherings, and/or lack of preventive measures including hand washing, wearing masks and social distancing) or whether both are contributing.'<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;But, as a result of the new wave of infections, the country's healthcare infrastructure is being pushed to the limit across the land, including in the remote Himalayan region.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir, the weekly average of Covid 19 cases has increased 11-fold in the past month.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In Telengana state in southern India, home to Hyderabad city where most of India's vaccine makers are based, the weekly average of infections has increased 16-fold in the past month.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Meanwhile, election campaigns are continuing in West Bengal state in eastern India, amid an alarming increase there as well, and experts fear that crowded rallies could fuel the spread of the virus.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Top leaders of the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have campaigned heavily to win polls in the region.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;By contrast, in Delhi, officials have begun to impose stringent measures again.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Indian capital was shut down over the weekend, but now authorities are extending that for a week: all shops and factories will close, except for those that provide essential services, like grocery stores. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;People are not supposed to leave their homes, except for a handful of reasons, like seeking medical care. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;They will be allowed to travel to airports or train stations - a difference from the last lockdown when thousands of migrant workers were forced to walk to their home villages.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That harsh lockdown last year, which lasted months, left deep scars. Politicians have since been reticent to even mention the word. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;When similar measures were imposed in Mahrashtra state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, in recent days, officials refused to call it a lockdown. Those restrictions are to last 15 days.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Kejriwal, the Delhi official, urged calm, especially among migrant workers who particularly suffered during the previous shutdown, saying this one would be 'small.'<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;But many feared it would spell economic ruin. Amrit Tripathi, a laborer in New Delhi, was among the thousands who walked home in last year's lockdown.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;'We will starve,' he said, if the current measures are extended.  </p>
