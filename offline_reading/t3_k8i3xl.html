    <strong>I'm at stage now where I'll just take the vaccine... I don't give a shit any more</strong>
    <p><p>I'll hold it off for as long as possible, but it's a matter of time before you have to decide whether to continue living in the society or leave it altogether. There won't be any other choice.</p>
<p>My parents live halfway across the world (we emigrated). If I have to be vaccinated before I'm allowed to fly again, then yes, I'll take it.</p>
<p>My child's school sooner or later is gonna demand that either students gets vaccinated or they stay home. Once that happens me and my wife will also get vaccinated. Either it's none of us, or all of us.</p>
<p>I don't give a shit any more. Whether it kills us or turns us into mind-controlled zombies devoid of freewill - I don't care. I've had enough.</p></p>

        <p>Most people will be perfectly happy being slaves. However, I wouldn’t give in and roll up my sleeve so fast. There are a lot more of us not okay with this totalitarian agenda than you’d think and there are people actively working to build outside of their systems of control if you look in the right places. The American revolution only needed a tiny minority of the people to actively resist the British crown. </p>
<p>Also, many public schools do have exceptions, whether it is religious or otherwise. If they refuse exemptions, it may be time to consider pulling your child out of their school and doing homeschool or sending them to a private school if you are able to and can afford it. If one needs a vaccination card to fly on the major airlines, there will also most definitely be a market for falsified vaxx records.</p>

        <p>It's unrealistic to talk about black market vaccine records. In what other area of life have you used counterfeit records? There are thriving markets of forged passports and driving licences as well. How many of us have used those?</p>

        <p>It's fairly easy <em>now</em> because, unless you work in healthcare or some other job/school requires it, you can basically evade any vaccine you don't want.</p>
<p>However, if what they have been saying and implying is true at all, then having a health passport is going to be mandatory, and having it up-to-date with bullshit vaccines is going to be needed in order to do anything and everything.</p>
<p>Unless you plan to live in the mountains, they will manipulate you into it eventually. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they do shit like inject the vaccine into people who need medical attention (ex: your appendix ruptures and before they treat you for it, they demand you get vaccinated) or get arrested or whatever. Seems they also plan to scout areas like forests to find dissenters, and then lock them up in their isolation camps until they accept the vaccine. Before you give me a macho "Fuck that, I'll stay in their isolation camp forever", they're going to make it hell on Earth for anyone staying there; the kind of hell where you'll be begging for death and they won't allow it.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you feel that way, man.</p>
<p>I feel the same way, to be completely honest with you. As much as I want to fight back and refuse the vaccine, I also feel that, realistically, unless we have millions of people reject the vaccine, and more places refuse to accept health passports and the like, most of us are going to end up being forced into it eventually, one way or another. </p>
<p>I know people here will say "Just go live in the forest and evade it" but, if the leaks coming out are any true at all, the government is going to go after dissenters, and place them into isolation facilities until they give in and get vaccinated, and have their property seized on top of that. </p>
<p>Another thing is that I've been beaten down so much by the events of these last few months, the restrictions, by the people who are still terrified and support the government mandates, and even by folks fighting the New Normal who also seem to either support the vaccines or act like this is going away soon (soon being months in now, and they themselves hypocritically push the goalposts) that I just don't even care anymore either. I am emotionally and physically drained now. My body is weak from both health problems I've been having and stress from everything going on. I don't know if I have the will or strength to keep this going especially since I feel like a reject even in the group I am supposed to belong in. This has brought out such an ugly side of humanity, and my hatred of people has grown tenfold since March of this year. </p>
<p>Whenever I've talked to some people about what the New World Order will entail, know what they say to me? "That doesn't sound so bad! Why are you against a world that will have equality, and the government will be giving people money so they won't go poor?" Maybe humanity deserves whatever is coming to it...</p>

        <p>You nailed why these movements are cloaked in beautiful language, because if you disagree with the movement, you tacitly hate what it’s named. Disagree with the concept of UBI? You hate equality. Disagree with limiting production and consumption of animal products? You are a climate denier. Skeptical of the motives behind the BLM movement? You’re racist.</p>

        <p>Not to be rude, but "duh". If they said "Well, the Great Reset entails income for all, however we will be exerting more control over your lives via surveillance and other restrictions while also taking away private property rights", people would be less enthusiastic about all of this. Thus why they pepper words like inclusivity, equality, "a new beginning", and other flowery phrases. Same with crap said for the pandemic like "we're all in this together", to give an illusion of unity and comfort. It's psychological manipulation.</p>

        <p>That's their whole point.  They are counting on all the people who are tired of it to end up taking it to just get it over with.  All of it, the social bits, the news, the conflict, the shaming, the lies, the fear , it's all to wear us down.  They know many people don't want it, so they are long gaming, wearing us thin.</p>
<p>But the more people that say fuck it, the more of us get fucked collectively.    </p>
<p>Imagine the teenagers, young adults?  Many will run for this vaccine.  They equate it with being able to continue living free again.  That is coercion, and it is also a lie.  </p>
<p>Not to sound lame, but we all need each other.  Or none of us will be free.</p>
