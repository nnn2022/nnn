    <strong>Genuine question from a lockdown opponent</strong>
    <p><p>I haven't supported masks or lockdowns for covid since the beginning, and at first I found it refreshing to discover this group of supposedly like-minded skeptics.  But all I see here now is a reversal of covidiot logic.  Where they fear nebulous poorly-founded reports of "long covid", you guys fear equally nebulous and unfounded "vaccine injury".  Where young healthy doomers legitimately fear dying of covid despite the laughably negligible statistical likelihood, you guys fear dying of the pfizer jab.   Where they baselessly claim that covid causes infertility, you guys equally baselessly claim the reverse.  Where lockdowners hurl unrepeatable epithets at antimaskers for "killing grandma", I will never forget this sub wishing murder charges on a grieving mother who miscarried post-vaccination, despite the fact that her OB (as most do) recommended the shot, despite the fact that there's a 99.99% chance the miscarriage had nothing to do with the vaccine.  It's no better than covidiots attacking a mother for miscarrying after contracting covid from some unkosher socializing .</p>
<p>Covid exists, it literally does kill a small portion of people who get it, what happened to accepting the risk and living with it?  That's what I thought this sub was about.  But apparently now we're inventing vaccine risks and condemning people for accepting those risks, no matter how negligible.  Why not live and let live? </p>
<p>This sub has taken a real toxic turn since the vaccines started rolling out and I don't think it's doing lockdown skeptics any favors.</p></p>

        <p>You sound like the only thing you're truly upset about is the fact that some people on this sub are not in favor of the covid treatment. There are real risks and real consequences to something that is basically an experiment being tested on unknowing people whom honestly just want to be healthy. It's actually pretty sad.</p>

        <p>There are real risks and real consequences to catching covid too (which is also a new disease so uncharted territory there) so I don't understand the hate for people who make the pretty damn good guestimation that vaccine risk &lt; covid risk, <em>even if both risks are very very small</em></p>

        <p>Because I know the "experts" aren't actually stupid. They are clearly fear-mongering to push an agenda and the vaccines are a part of that. Why would I take an experimental medical treatment recommended by the same people lieing to me about the disease it allegedly protects me from?</p>

        <p>People here would rather trust their own immune systems than trust Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, etc who are pushing jabs that were insufficiently tested and have been known for decades to cause life-threatening conditions related to antibody dependent enhancement.

        <p>Well at least we have been dealing with covid itself for a year and some, and we know the numbers, symptoms and risks. The experimental covid jabs however are brand new, and we do not have any idea what to expect. You can't just say there is a small risk of injury from a jab that people have just started taking a few months ago. It's like you don't believe that vax injury is a thing at all. </p>
<p>But I do see your point with the post. I think spreading hate either way is not going to get anyone anywhere at this point.</p>

        <p>I get your points, and I agree none of us should be letting ourselves slip into toxicity like that. </p>
<p>However, may I just point out that covid is simply nature being nature, if you get it, it’s just nature being random. </p>
<p>But a vaccine is a manmade who-knows-what, and tptb want to force everyone to get it. It’s this issue that causes the anger and fear regarding its effects.</p>
<p>But yeah, whoever is fine with that can go get the vaccine, more power to them, and we should live and let live.</p>

        <p>For a 22 year old with no preexisting conditions, like myself, there is greater risk to taking the vaccine than actually getting the virus. Everyone I know who has gotten the vaccine says they felt like death for 3 days after getting their shot. Literally everyone. </p>
<p>I got covid 2 months ago however, and I basically just had a slight headache and a runny nose for 2 days. It was very mild compared to what I'm hearing from friends who got the vaccine.</p>

        <p>&rt;...  despite the fact that there's a 99.99% chance the miscarriage had nothing to do with the vaccine. </p>
<p>What science did you use to come by this number?</p>

        <p>Earnest question from me, a person expecting a child: I thought that the vaccine had not been tested on pregnant women?</p>
<p>I know in my jurisdiction some women complained about that, and so some pregnant health care providers were being vaccinated after consulting with a doctor. But in general in most places I thought pregnant women were not being given the vaccine because no testing had been done. Is this incorrect?</p>

        <p>If any OBs recommend their patients get the vaccine they are <em>not</em> following the manufacturers warning that pregnant women and women who want to conceive within 1-2 years not get the vaccine. </p>
<p>Also I don’t see anyone claiming the vaccine for sure causes infertility- we don’t know because they literally have not done the reproductive toxicity studies yet. The clinical trials as a whole won’t be done until 2023, and I won’t take an experimental treatment. There’s a lot of pushback here because a certain percentage of the population seems to want to mandate an unapproved vaccine (which is illegal both in the US and according to international law established after the medical experimentation that went on during WW2)</p>
