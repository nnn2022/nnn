    <strong>What ever happened to Beta and Gamma?</strong>
    <p><p>MSM/Pro-vaxx:</p>
<p>2 weeks to flatten the curve! Let me lick door knobs to get time off work! Let me get my UI benefits since the govt told me to shut down my small business and not pay rent, the moratorium will protect me for now. Let me lose my employment yet receive 3 stimulus checks, this should cover about 2 weeks worth of expenses! Let me walk my dog outside yet confine inside otherwise, can't hug grandma now, that would be too much serotonin and I was told not to! Go out and support BLM protests! Black squares or you're a racist pig! Oh, but #AsianLivesMatter don't really warrant a widespread protest. Just BLM. Oh, and Kamela reminded me that if Trump told me to get it, I wouldn't! Seems legit, she seems medically certified to give me advice over my health. I trust her. Also everyone, make sure to get the jab! 100% of us are unvaccinated yet still alive, but we JUST need to hit that sweet 70% and then we can take comfort in our new normal! I know it's only EUA, and technically there have been no prior studies on humans, but it's okay! This will help me go on that trip I've been dying to go on since the onset of this mess! Also I heard to get the jab and you won't have to wear a mask again! I could even win free incentives just for doing it, I heard there's a $50,000 dollar lottery in CA! Wonder where they got that from? Also if you get the jab and you'll have 99% protection against COVID! Hence why we can finally ditch these god-awful masks. We're all in this together guys! If it can save just one life, I'll fucking take it!</p>
<p>After &rt;1 month of freedom AKA summer:</p>
<p>VAERs isn't the complete picture, yet we can't rationally/statistically explain why! Death to the unvaccinated! Deny them health service, school, jobs, food! Let's create a 2-tiered society, seems legit! We're the non-discriminatory heroes in this after all! Delta is rapidly spreading through the unvaccinated! The vaccinated are sick now thanks to the unvaccinated! Delta is deadlier than previous strains! Delta is highly transmissible! The vaccine works, that's why we're masking again! Also my vaccine worked so well, that I have to get boosters despite being told 2 jabs and we could go back to normal! I wonder how many jabs I'll need to take next year...</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>The Skeptical/Uninjected/Anti-jab for specifically mRNA technology, not necessarily anti-vaxx:</p>
<p><strong>Aight so if I'm a super-spreader, how am I still alive to not only have the pleasure of witnessing the circus that has been the past 1.5 years, economic/social/political effects and all, but ALSO let COVID fester and mutate inside of me while having the magical pleasure of spreading it on to others while surviving myself?</strong></p>
<p>Almost like natural immunity's on my side like it has been up to now? Asymptomatic spread? Haha well, guess you should have kept YOUR masks on if that is in fact true and you in fact believe in the science. It's not like it would have just disappeared because you took the vaccine, unless for whatever reason in the span of 33 days injection efficacy wears off. Gee, maybe you should've waited for a more reliable injection?</p>
<p>Let me ask y'all this. How were you all still alive before you took the jab? Most of us who took it started getting it in say February/spring of 2021? So how is it, that you almost lasted/did last 1 whole year without taking the jab? Could it be, that the 99.9% chance of survival is in fact true?</p>
<p>We who continue to wait haven't seen that guaranteed ventilator and it's been 1.5 years now. It's almost like, we too have a 99.9% chance of surviving COVID per CDC data, granted we are relatively healthy and don't have a list of comorbidities that cause the complications a lot of you guys so willingly spread fear about! It's almost like, those who were subject to such things died with Alpha, and will continue being highest on the list to be at risk if they're still around! It's almost like, social media posts distorted that tiny percentage of people at the onset of this entire situation in 2020 in order to pen-hole you guys into believing that this virus was not just a novel virus, but truly deadly despite stastics saying otherwise, and using that narrative to support the rationale of taking an injection that, for whatever reason, is still only EUA.</p>
<p>It's almost like, we who continue to wait and be harassed by all sides of MSM, employers, friends, family, and those who wish us death, actually <strong>choose</strong> to decide what we want to do with our bodies, rather than allowing broadcasted fear-mongering/the govt/the CDC dictate our decisions. It's almost like, we trust our bodies to do our thing like we have been up to 2020. 2019 anyone? Remember living in a mask-free world, even though people die of the flu, homicide, car accidents, homelessness, poverty? Remember when masks didn't symbolize the censorship of the uninjected, which at one point <strong>everyone once was</strong>?</p>
<p>Remember that time, when we weren't so divided on such a personal matter, to the point where family members and close friends are no more?</p>
<p>Remember when you didn't have to announce or post to all your IG followers that you got the flu vaccine, because it'd be really awkward to just announce something so personal like that to everyone despite a good chunk of people still dying from the flu annually up to now?</p>
<p>Remember when viruses stayed in level-4 bio-safety labs, we didn't panic buy toilet-paper or all a majority of other supplies because that was the advice circulating, that we were somewhat more rational because we were able to engage in normal human activities without fear of discrimination or presumed risk?</p>
<p>Remember when we only relied on DNA-based vaccines to do the job for us, and didn't blindly just take a completely new technology for the sake of regaining our rights and freedoms we all (relatively) equally enjoyed?</p>
<p>Remember when those DNA-based vaccines actually did the trick, and had years of studies to back them up?</p>
<p>Why haven't we heard news on mRNA vaccines until all of a sudden, now?</p>
<p>Where are the previous studies on people/animals showing why this is completely safe, and that the benefits outweigh the risks?</p>
<p>Why are we rushing to inject everyone, despite demanding for no control group (that does not include the immunocompromised nor children, but relatively healthy adults), when there haven't been any previous studies on mRNA having been used on humans ever before? How can you compare vaccine efficacy if there's no other group for comparison? How can you know how to narrow down data for how mRNA technology affects people if there's no other group for comparison? Both short-term and long-term? How long are DNA-vaccines usually tested for full FDA approval? Should it be the same for mRNA technology? </p>
<p><strong>Why were mRNA vaccines promoted over DNA-based vaccines when DNA-based ones have served us just fine up to now?</strong> </p>
<p>Why couldn't mRNA have developed independently?</p>
<p>Why the rush?</p>
<p>Remember when we didn't anticipate what the CDC would announce next?</p>
<p>Remember when a good portion of us were skeptical of Big Pharma and started to want to eat healthier due to the amount of chemicals/preservatives the US puts in its food, despite healthier food typically being more expensive than junk food?</p>
<p><strong>Also, what happened to Beta and Gamma?</strong></p>
<p>Did they just not decide to show up for the party, showed up to the party at warp speed and we didn't even realize it, or is the CDC incapable of looking up the Greek alphabet AND providing us with consistent advice on what to do? Has there been any single explanation for this? Jee, it's almost like the goalposts keep moving no matter what you do, and the <strong>leaders you are to put trust in aren't entirely sure of their data, at minimum, yet have no problems pushing you to comply with their mandates</strong>. It's almost like, 1.5 years of isolation, social distancing, doomscrolling, lack of access to the outside world and gyms, lack of hugs and smiles have made people forget that <strong>social, mental and emotional health are also important to maintain. It's not called a health triangle for nothing.</strong></p>
<p>Please remember those that committed suicide, OD'd, had mental breakdowns, went homeless due to the mental/social/physical strain of lockdowns on all facets of life and the economy.</p>
<p>We, collectively as humanity, are <strong>social beings</strong>.</p>
<p>It's clear that we all have mentally suffered a lot these past 1.5 years, no matter your stance on anything, whether it be politics, science, or anything else you can think of that has only further divided people and made us hyperfocus on what makes us different, not complete as a whole.</p>
<p>Those who want to get it can do so. Those who feel this situation is off or want to wait for long-term data, since typically DNA-based vaccines alone take 2-3 years to complete rigorous testing including long-term testing, <strong>also have the right to do so</strong>.</p>
<p>We prized Western Civilization for the ability to have a choice, for the ability to speak freely, unrestricted, on any matter. We prized it for the ability to maintain freedoms that cannot be appreciated in places like North Korea and China, and the former USSR and 3rd Reich. If you want to be governed in such a way, feel free to move there, but respect that we, the skeptical, have a reasonable and valid cause of concern over this issue, and would very much like to maintain the rights and freedoms we all increasingly struggle to maintain.</p>
<p>Further division will not solve these problems.</p>
<p>Question who said it was best to impose lockdowns. Who said it was best to mask up. Who said it was best to social distance. Who said it was best to stay indoors rather than connecting with others, face to face, and not locking down. Who said it was best to get the injection, despite not seeming to know full data on it as we now know, yet made sloppy/pre-mature promises and continued furthering goalposts despite meeting past ones (and yes, the curve was flat. We did reach that even with half of us injected. The graph also went down in 2020, you'd think that's odd since there was no vaccine to rely on then, going by the logic that injections are the cure-all, right?)</p>
<p><strong>By the way, when was the last time anyone mentioned the pandemic becoming endemic?</strong></p>
<p>Oh that's right, that wouldn't enable Pfizer alone to continue making the $18.9 billion it did 2nd quarter through booster sales. Jokes on you, Iceland wants the goalposts in place for 15 years.</p>
<p>This ends when we all realize that there is no end to this goose-chase until we decide on it. It ends when we realize that the figures we trusted have not been able to come up with reasonable nor consistent measures, and instead feel the need to censor those that don't agree with them or question the rationale that led up to the impositions, using the media as its biggest tool.</p>
<p>It ends when we realize that this virus is in fact <strong>never going away</strong>, and at some point the immunocompromised, kids, and those who believe in holistic medicines and/or otheriwse will want to be human again, and we all live our lives freely like we once all did. We all will be exposed to it at one point or another. You can't prevent that from happening in a world of almost 8 billion. You may lose your vaccine card or have your phone stolen. It will soon become a hassle to have to check in everywhere when you could once freely go in. Think about it.</p>
<p><strong>It ends when all of us, as people, united against those that have been pro-longing goalposts and instating mandates without reasonable/clear explanations, say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, LET US LIVE FREELY LIKE WE ONCE DID.</strong></p>

<p>\^A lot of government documentation here. Even if you don't agree with all the videos, which I myself don't, this is a place to access direct government documentation and archives of what certain figures have done in the past, before 2020.</p></p>

        <p>The market does not need 15 different products. It only makes buyers confused what to buy. Marketing budget is also limited. It is more efficient to focus marketing effort on a single successful product(delta) and cancel other product lines. Gamma and Beta are like, the pontiac and oldsmobile of coronaviruses.</p>

        <p>Apparently delta (formerly known as the Indian Variant) has mostly out-competed the others to become the dominant variant due to its  higher transmittability.</p>
