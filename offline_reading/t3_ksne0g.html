    <strong>Saw this on FB today and it sums up perfectly the two side we currently have in the “pandemic”</strong>
    <p><p>I deleted someone as a friend earlier because they had a whole post dedicated to ripping non mask wearers to shreds. And the comments were awful. She’s absolutely entitled to her opinion, as are her friends, but I don’t need to be reading that rubbish right now. Just as I would hope people delete me if my posts make their eyes roll. </p>
<p>So apparently non mark wearers are 100% responsible for the rise in cases. A couple of things about this: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don’t know where everyone is seeing the maskless faces because, lately, I’m usually the only person I see anywhere without a mask. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People like me who refuse to wear masks are almost always certainly NOT getting tested. It’s not a case that we believe in one &amp; not the other. We think they’re both bullshit. I wouldn’t get tested even if I was bedridden because the test is 100% useless. I would treat the sickness like every other one...rest, fluids, sleep, vitamins. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The people who refuse to wear masks are also not getting tested. So who are those getting tested? </p>
<p>99.9% of those getting tested are mask wearers. So this is the group responsible for the escalating (fake) positives, right? </p>
<p>So are your masks working? </p>
<p>Oh...but the government said they are to protect others, not you. So, do you believe that a virus can get inside the mask when you are wearing it but if you are a positive case, it can’t get out of your mask to infect somebody else? Like a one way swinging door? </p>
<p>There is tonnes of evidence to suggest masks are useless (if you believe in all these so called positive cases), but let’s forget about evidence &amp; paperwork for a second. What does your brain say? Do you really think logic suggests that masks are beneficial? Or is it that you don’t care because they are psychologically beneficial &amp; make you believe that you are doing what is right so actual benefits are irrelevant? </p>
<p>There are those who are constantly shouting that it’s only a bloody mask &amp; we should all just stick them on us, regardless of how us anti-maskers feel, regardless if they work well or not &amp; just get on with it because everyone else is wearing them &amp; it’s no big deal. But it is a big deal to me. It might not be to you &amp; that’s fine. Wear your mask. Wear two. But I want evidence that they work effectively before I wear one &amp; that evidence doesn’t exist. Clearly. In fact, wouldn’t you agree that it’s quite the opposite? </p>
<p>But even before seeing the supporting evidence of mask wearing, I want to see evidence that the PCR is a reliable diagnostic tool because that’s really where the pandemic begins &amp; ends. That’s much more important to understand before we move on to following questions. But that evidence doesn’t exist either. Is that not deeply concerning to you all? </p>
<p>I told you to look into the PCR test but that’s not happening. People are still screaming about cases. When somebody approaches me to ask me where my mask is, I should respond by asking them where their evidence is to support the PCR as the gold standard of testing for this earth crippling virus. But I bet somebody would call me a nut job, a psychopath or worse for doing so. No more psychotic than a person asking me to wear a mask when they haven’t done any research into what they are actually trying to enforce me to do. If you want me to ‘share a link to any studies to support what you’re saying’ (😴), take a scroll back through my page since March/April. There is any amount to choose from in my Dr. Google portfolio. </p>
<p>Human rights gets laughed at a lot lately with narrative lovers referring to us as ‘Karen’s with hurt feelings’ among a load of other rubbish. They really can’t comprehend what they are laughing at, nor have they cared to look. The fact that their friends are laughing too is good enough for them. Independent critical thinking is not required. I wouldn’t be so quick to laugh at those fighting to hold possession of our human rights if I were you. </p>
<p>We are on the cusp of not being able to exist in society without a vaccine. A vaccine that I won’t discuss here because if you’re not afraid of it by now then nothing anybody says will instill reservations within you. A theory that was laughed at some time ago yet, here we are. A vaccine that is only step one of many steps that lie ahead. Again, if you believe in the vaccine, just like you believe in the masks, it is your prerogative whether or not you participate. Take as many as you want. If they work, then you don’t need to worry whether or not I have had mine. You don’t need to hate us or shame us or, worst of all, be afraid of us. You are only afraid because you have been told to be afraid but, again, please think critically. </p>
<p>Your vaccine offers you 99% protection (I say this only as a reference to the lies being spouted. I think it offers you jack shit apart from some potentially serious side effects). My immune system offers me 99.7% protection so we’re both good, right? We’ve just made different choices, right? Numbers don’t lie, right? </p>
<p>Contrary to what most people believe in 2021, I believe that clean air, fresh air, socialisation, hugs, basic soap, good food, vitamins, sunshine &amp; MY IMMUNE SYSTEM are everything I need to avoid being killed by a virus. You believe that masks, chemicals, social distancing, isolation &amp; a vaccine provide this. That’s ok. We are all allowed to choose how we feel &amp; what we believe, right? Especially saying as there are many experts worldwide who share my beliefs, just like you believe your expert of choice? Especially saying as I can’t harm you because asymptomatic spread doesn’t exist. Or don’t you believe that either? That’s ok too 😊 But that’s not what I believe. </p>
<p>If you still haven’t considered the possibility that Covid is a rebranded flu then, again, that’s your choice 😊 (getting a bit repetitive, isn’t it). But I believe that’s exactly what it is. And the numbers would suggest this is correct. </p>
<p>Still not a single case of influenza in Ireland since this year’s flu season began? 🙊 Apparently this is because we are wearing masks, social distancing &amp; hand sanitising but the rise in covid is because we aren’t doing these 3 things 😆 </p>
<p>Jesus, it’s even crazier when I type it out.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks. I think you’ve just formed the basic lay of the land for a covid Factsheet sheer I’ve been fantasising about putting together so I can give it to people who start arguing with me or who disagree or who genuinely are curious about the science.</p>
<p>If we take your logical argument, add in all the scientific journal articles that support it - of which there are many - maybe we can start an anti propaganda process!</p>

        <p>Let’s hope so, they’re going to have to listen to us at some point ... they cannot simply steamroller us when there is compelling evidence to the contrary... hopefully if we stick together we will be able to get them to see reason!</p>
