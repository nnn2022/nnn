        <p>Even if we had been super strict like Australia it wouldn't be enough for them. Just check out the Australia subs to see how many people are saying their country didn't go hard enough and they were totally incompetent and other No True Lockdown stuff.</p>

        <p>Yeah the Aussies wanting even more restrictions I find very shocking/disturbing, considering it's turned into a country in permanent martial law</p>

        <p>Not only that, its over a virus that has (if you are to crunch the case/death rate) a survival of 99.8% if your unvaccinated, almost 100% if you're vaccinated. If you're under 65 and healthy, the risk of death is very little. </p>
<p>Forfeiting liberties over a threat that is so banal makes this even more surreal.</p>

        <p>I had this argument with a family member.</p>
<p>"We were never locked down! No one held us to in our homes at gunpoint. It's such an exaggeration. There was so much more we could have sacrificed."</p>
<p>No, we were never "locked down". Just all my favorite restaurants that I knew and loved were forced to close down by the government and many were shuttered permanently because of it. Millions were just declared nonessential and were pushed to the brink of poverty. Millions in certain parts of the country were threatened with fines and even arrest for being out past some arbitrary curfew or because they were in a place they weren't supposed to be because it was "nonessential" during 'Shelter in Place'. People were even kept from buying certain "nonessential" items. </p>
<p>I don't doubt we have it better than many countries that went completely totalitarian and made it illegal to step one toe outside your house, but this thinking is so dangerous. Doomers are actually begging big daddy government to lock them down harder.</p>
