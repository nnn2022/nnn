    <strong>Are these just the death-throes of overaged societies?</strong>
    <p><p>Old people have become such a political power in our democracies that they easily outvote the young generations which are also less politically active and less experienced in the political game. Im sure this is one of the reason for the dominance of the catastrophic lockdown policies. The strong old generations sacrifice the weak young generation on the altar of their own spoiledness. </p>
<p>Healthy species/cultures/societies need to rejuvenate constantly. Virus epidemics used to be such a regulatory mechanism. When people live too long while not being productive, let alone re-productive, the society will shrink and vanish. Sounds harsh but that simple reality. </p>
<p>My initial take on the virus hype in March 2020 was that even if the virus would turn out as deadly as it was initially predicted by the "experts" it wouldnt be catastrophic for society but on the contrary a huge relief, a boon, a boost.</p></p>

        <p>my mom is a boomer, but obviously anti-vax, anti-NWO, very anti-new normal. we were talking today and she said (paraphrasing obviously) "i care about YOUR health. i'm 62, i'd probably be okay if i got the vaccine, but you're in your 20s. your dad and i have invested so much into you. why would we stop now? i'd like grandkids one day and the possibility for you to be able to occasionally lend me a hand in old age."  </p>
<p>my mom wants the best for me, she realizes she won't live forever. but it's bizarre to me that more parents don't think this way. like why are we sacrificing the health of young people with their lives ahead of them for old people who will die soon anyways?</p>
<p>the greatest generation did so much to give their kids (the boomers) a great life. most of them seem to have forgotten that.</p>
