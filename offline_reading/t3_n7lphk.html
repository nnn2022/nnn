    <strong>I don’t completely understand this sub yet</strong>
    <p><p>English is not my first language, sorry!
And it is not my intention with this post to disrespect this sub, i just have some questions about this subject.</p>
<p>Hi! First of all thanks for reading my post,
I just learnedly about this sub and looked around for a while, but after reading a couple of posts I wondered exactly how this sub think the lockdown and corona works, so I got a few questions that would clear it up for me.
Here are the questions:
1. Do you think the government believes lockdowns are necessary or are they enforcing lockdowns for other reasons?</p>
<ol>
<li>I see a lot of people saying that the corona-virus has a 99,7% survival rate to prove that a lockdown is unnecessary, yet the corona-virus has killed over 580.000 people, how could this be?</li>
</ol>
<p>3 there is more evidence of masks being effective than evidence against it, at least when i looked on google scholar, thats what i found.
So even though masks most likely work, and it doesn’t inconvenience someone whatsoever and only has benefits , why do you still refuse to wear a mask?(of course if you have a condition that makes wearing masks dangerous then this question is not for you).</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this, i hope some people will answer my questions. Bye!</p></p>

<p>The purpose of "lockdowns" is psychological.</p>

<p>The figure of 580k you mention is intentionally misleading.</p>

<li>I believe most governments initially had lockdown out of fears of models that said death tolls would be high. Since around July 2020, other factors have come in to play.  </li>
<li>You need to look at death numbers with more context to other years and remember recorded <em>infections</em> are likely much lower than actual. One of the worlds foremost doctors has estimated Covid to be just slightly more lethal than flu. John Ioannidis.  </li>
<li>Masks may have some dubious ‘science’ ‘proving’ they work, in a lab. There is zero data, we have a year of data now, that they have reduced deaths or infections.</li>

<p>Yes, it is an extrapolation from the sample. It is not 750 M confirmed cases. Therefore it is used in estimating death rates.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The case fatality ratio is measured by deaths / confirmed cases. Influenza's case fatality ratio is significantly lower than SARS-CoV-2's fatality ratio.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than influenza.</p>

        <p>2) 2020 in my country (Poland) ended in 60 thousand excess deaths. </p>
<p>35 thousand of those were due to the closed healthcare system, where they delayed a lot of services, operations and medical treatments, so people were dying to not cured/not detected cancers, not treated heart diseases etc.</p>
<p>25 thousand of those were due to the coronavirus, where only 5 thousand was due to the coronavirus only, and 20 thousand was coronavirus plus comorbidities.</p>
<p>Also a lot of information about incentives to give Covid code to many deaths due to the fact that every Covid treatment meant additional money for the medical institution.</p>

<li>We have vaccinated 50 and older in my province, which account for 98% of covid deaths in Canada. And we went into our hardest lockdown yet...</li>
<li>90% of Canada's deaths are with a comorbidity or more. In the US, it's roughly the same, so the 580,000 deaths are more like 60,000 deaths. <br>
<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2777502">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2777502</a></li>
</ol>
<p>\&rt;15.9 million (bootstrap 95% CI, 15.5-16.5 million) asymptomatic or undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections had occurred in the United States as of September 30, 2020</p>
<p>As of September 30, 7.55m had been diagnosed. So, only 1/3 of US cases were diagnosed.</p>
<p>So, if the trend continued, and the US has 33m diagnosed cases, it should have a total of 100m cases, which is 30% of the population.</p>
<p>60,000 deaths/100,000,000 cases = 0.0006 deaths per case</p>
<ol>
<li>That's kind of like asking the spectators for a car race to wear helmets. Helmets work in car races! True, but the spectators don't need one. We saw pretty early that covid is very dangerous for the vulnerable and pretty normal for most people.</li>

        <p>The Covid death statistics are useless as they rely solely on PCR which is incapable of diagnosing a disease. Excess death is better but still subject to manipulation as it is modeling. It also cannot be used as a 1-1 for Covid deaths as lockdowns are another unprecedented event and the adverse health effects from them are still being discovered. Even then I believe the excess deaths for the US, which I believe is what you are referring to with the 580k deaths, is about 10% higher which could easily be explained by the effects of long term fear, anxiety and isolation, plus the nocebo effect when "diagnosed" with the "deadly" Covid-19. While there are plenty of studies purporting to show masks work, they are all lab experiments and do not remotely represent the real world. All the real world trials done in regards to influenza and influenza like illness show no significant effect.</p>
<p>Edit: forgot to mention denial and avoidance of non-Covid healthcare as well for a contributing factor to excess death.</p>

<li>If you haven't figured this out, please hurry and get your shot.</li>
<li>CDC came out this week and revised down actual Covid deaths in America to 5 percent of the number of deaths counted, so, yeah, the survival rate is extraordinary.</li>
<li>A mask is Personal Protection Equipment. It's YOUR protection. My mask is not YOUR protection, so why you worried about MY mask? You protect yourself and I'll protect myself, as we both see fit. That's what FREE people do.</li>

        <p>Hi! So I will first say that you should watch yourself here, there really are people who could be defined as 'crazy conspiracy theorists', as well as brigaders trying to make us look bad. But here are my answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This is a tough question, but here I am inclined to say for other reasons. I honestly don't believe that they could be incompetent enough not to see that the sheer scale of the damage this is doing outweighs any benefit it has. And incompetence doesn't explain all of the manipulative efforts and messing with people's heads to get them to do what they want, not really. What could these other reasons be? Money, power, political credit are obvious ones at least. Politicians are getting praise for doing this and their number one concern is staying in office for money. I'm still open to it just being a case of they panicked, screwed up and admitting it would be political suicide, so they're trying to get out of it while taking credit, but at this point there's no need to prolong such strict restrictions in many places when we have vaccines available that they can take credit for and use to stop this, yet they're dragging it out for as long as possible. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of people don't pay attention to the fact that all deaths are recorded within 28 days of a positive PCR test, but most articles state it, at least where I am in the UK. I can see a number of issues with that. First, there's no follow up on whether the death was actually caused by covid, or just with it. That in itself is a problem. So, you could have recovered over three weeks ago, clearly have died from something else and yet you'd still be put in the stats. Secondly, the fact that it's just a positive PCR test is an issue too. Pcr tests, as stated by their creator Dr Kary Mullis, were not designed to be a diagnostics tool because they are too sensitive. It'll give a positive if it finds a dead virus particle up your nose, or live virus but not enough of it to infect you, so it just detects the virus rather than a true infection. Not only that, but there's also false positives simply because the cycle threshold is set too high, over the recommended number which I think is 25. So all in all, it's a recipe for totally innacurate, super inflated death statistics. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1">Here</a> are the death  rates, straight from the CDC, so to me that's the only explanation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks are a complex issue. In my view, there are two parts to the issue. The masks themselves, and the mandates. Now, when dealing with masks we first view the conflicting evidence - some studies say it works, some don't. When you have a lot of evidence for both sides, coming to a conclusion is very hard. But this evidence is primarily observational or lab studies. While these types of studies have their merit, observational studies can easily mix up correlation and causation, and the way things work in a lab might not reflect the way they work when affected by external factors. So the logical things to do is to get better quality evidence, right? That's where we bring in RCT studies, which are conducted in the real world and are basically the gold standard of studies. We currently only have one, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">here.</a> The results? Inconclusive. This further adds to the conflicting evidence on masks, rather than clearing anything up. So, with all this in mind, we are not basing the mandate on a solid foundation of clear evidence, which is never a good start. You might then say, 'even if we don't know, better to be safe than sorry, right?'. Well, in the way of you personally wearing a mask, sure you could say that. But when considering mandates, the issue is way more complex. I'll start by raising the question - is it ethical to force people to do something which in some circumstances may cause them difficulty, for unknown benefit, and is it okay to do that in a free country or does it step on bodily autonomy? Now, I think that policies which step on freedom and autonomy should not be considered at all until the evidence is clear that it'll work, but if you have a different answer to that question then that's okay, I understand. But back to the better to be safe than sorry thing. This is based on the assumption that mask mandates have no consequences. They do, from my observation both social and environmental. Social consequences include a general difficulty in communication, sometimes hostility between people or even violence in some places over the matter, increased disrespect for people's medical privacy, and just generally causes a decrease in morale since facial expressions are important for our communication and connection. Much as these may sound insignificant, when stretched over a prolonged time period they are bad for people's mental health. More importantly in my opinion, there is the issue with disposable masks. It is known by now that they are more effective that cloth masks, but the sheer number being thrown away is adding to an already serious problem with plastic pollution in the oceans. This is an issue we were previously trying to resolve, but now it is one that we're making even worse that it already was. I think it is also worth mentioning the way that people use their masks. Shoving them in dirty pockets, not washing them and all that bad hygeine regarding something you're using to cover your face could have potential health consequences, something I've been meaning to look into. So as much as in theory it could be good for our health, mask wearing in practice comes up against habits like these which could cancel out its effects or even be harmful to our health. So basically, my stance on mask mandates is that we shouldn't implement strict rules that have consequences based on conflicted and unclear evidence.</p>
