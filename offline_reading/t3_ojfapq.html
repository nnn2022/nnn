    <strong>Isn't automatically claiming we "spread misinformation" spreading misinformation?</strong>
    <p><p>I seriously doubt the folks who claim we "spread misinformation" are actually reading what we have to say. I bet all they do is take one look at title of the post and not even bother to read any of the points we make. That or they "skim" through what we say and not even fully read it and make conclusions on what we say based on their view. What people think of "spreading misinformation" is "information" given to them from the government or media.</p></p>

        <p>That‚Äôs the only response they have, they don‚Äôt want a debate and they don‚Äôt want to use any critical thinking. They are just following the MSM side of things and don‚Äôt question it. I do my research on anything that involves me or my family away from MSM and then make a decision. I am fortunate to have the time to do so. Others are peer pressures and brainwashed. It‚Äôs very very sad! If someone tells you to jump off a bridge are you gonna follow without questioning? HELL NO! That‚Äôs how I was raised. Thank god!!!  People are being raised now by MSM ,social media since they were kids. So so sad we don‚Äôt have many critical thinkers these days. I seriouslly think there are more people that question things but are too afraid to let others know .</p>

        <p>The truth is, both sides are spreading misinformation because neither side understand the long term effects of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Both sides mostly only have theories.</p>
<p>Still, I'd rather ask questions instead of just blindly accepting information.</p>

        <p>They are unable to say anything other than ‚Äòaw shut up and wear your mask, get your vax, stop spreading misinformation, it‚Äôs dangerous‚Äô. I have never (not once) seen someone genuinely argue something I or other reddit users have written. They can‚Äôt. There is no long term safety data ü§£ I love it when they come at us with the ‚Äòawww but it doesn‚Äôt matter that vaccines usually take 10 years because we did 10 years worth of testing in one week omg science üòçüòç‚úäüèºüí¶üí¶‚Äô </p>
<p>Eh, hello??? If they tested thalidomide with 10 years worth of testing in a week, would it have been safe? Would all those babies have been born with fully functional limbs??? No. They‚Äôd still be fucked. And it‚Äôs all on the scientists who developed the drug and didn‚Äôt test it for long term risks. If that‚Äôs not a lesson to learn from, I don‚Äôt know what the bloody hell is.</p>

        <p>The censors operates on a strategy of avoidance. They cannot defeat any serious argument because they do not operate on logic or good faith. By conditioning society to view people in terms of a collective group such as their race, sex, or class, they're able to categorize and apply collective labels to individuals which grants them a tool in which they are able to dismiss the arguments of individuals. This allows them fabricate the perception that they have stronger arguments without ever receiving criticism and prevents the indoctrinated whom support them from straying off the reservation as they view the world from an entirely collectivist lens. These people do not judge whether or not you have anything worthy of listening to until they understand what group you belong to, they are incapable of viewing you as an individual. </p>
<p>To compound this further, the censors often fabricate counter-culture groups to function as a controlled outlet for their opposition where they spread deliberate misinformation that later serves as evidence of the very conspiracies they criticize. An example of this is QAnon. QAnon is ridiculous because it is designed to <em>be</em> ridiculous. It was only ever used to tie dissidents down in false hope so that they would remain politically inactive during the 2020 election, trusting in some shadowy figure that would promise you that something would happen in "2 more weeks". You did not need to do anything, you did not need to be engaged, all you had to do was "trust in Q" and so these people were strung along until the election was over when they finally realized they got played. Where is QAnon now? Nowhere to be found. Like BLM it will go back into is box and appear again next election cycle where it will be used to ridicule the perfectly legitimate concerns half the population of the United States has.</p>
<p>Right wing, white supremacist, conspiracy theorist‚Äîthey're all the same thing, baseless labels to apply to people in order to dismiss everything you say before you even say it. Trying to argue with these people is fruitless when they won't even come to the table, only hard undeniable evidence in the atrocities they instigate will wake people up.</p>
