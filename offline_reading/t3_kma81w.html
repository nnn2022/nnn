        <p>We don't even need a vaccine for this thing. What we need is care packages of D, C and Zinc to everyone in the United States of America, for all businesses to be opened back up, and for the people who were pushing this masking and lockdown nonsense to be locked up in prison where they belong for abuse of their positions and lying to the general populace!</p>

        <p>Its just because they said so. Who knows what is in this vaccine. I hope someone tests it soon. </p>
<p>What I do know is, these people, with all the power, making all the decisions these days, will know, if they can get billions of people to shoot themselves full of a drug that was manufactured in a few months, for a virus that most everyone will survive, they can get billions of people to do just about anything.</p>

        <p>The utility is to make you immune to the virus, which means you won't get sick with the covid disease. Even if people remained contagious while immune, if a certain portion of the population is immune (40-60%) you get herd immunity, as the rate that the disease spreads is no longer exponential, so it slowly dies out.</p>

        <p>Herd immunity does not require vaccination. For decades, the definition has been that it comes from exposure.</p>

        <p>I didn't say or imply that it requires vaccination- but vaccination does also provide it, and one could also argue it does that in a safer method (as you become immune without contracting the disease, you are far less likely to experience complications). I also see that I'm getting downvoted and would like to note that I'm not taking sides, just telling you what the WHO would say the purpose of the vaccine is, even if it doesn't directly stop the spread of the virus- since you did ask.</p>
