    <strong>Guys, I’m losing my mind.</strong>
    <p><p>I lost my job 2 days ago. Today, I lost my 2 long-time friends, just because I’m affraid of Covid vaccines and I told them they should consider taking it. I even fuckin’ cried after similar discussion in the pub today, where I was (‘cause of restrictions) illegally. Another friend of mine told me there I should not take it so seriously and should just fuck somebody (a man if I want - I am a man).</p>
<p>I am telling myself it will get better, but it is getting too much for me to take it. I was always a helper and I stood by human rights and different opinions. Since barely no one takes me seriously anymore and I am tired of losing “friends”, do you have any idea how to stay sane? How to swallow a need to talk about it with people you care about? How to suppress my trait of expressing my opinions? How to keep fighting, fellow warriors of light?</p></p>

        <p>I've been in this similar situation many times. I've lost many close friends as a result of sharing information that went against many official narratives over the years. It hurts at first but knowing that you are fighting for truth you can only be rest assured that bending over and accepting the lies would only be a much darker path. Truth is that you can't unsee what you've seen and if they choose to remain ignorant or ostracize you as a result then they were never really your true friends in the first place.</p>
<p>I've come to the conclusion over the years that traversing the road of truth is not for everyone. And, for those that do decide to go on this journey are few and far between. Do not fret because eventually you find other like minded individuals, even IRL, that are on the same path as you and the friendships that you can build will be much better than the ones you've had before.</p>

        <p>Interesting. I guess I am in the middle of the truth path. I am figuring out how to adjust my life with this enlightenment. I still have at least 2 good friends, one of them shares the same opinions about vaccines and plandemic. We became very close during the quarantine, but sadly they both live in different towns and we have problem to find time to hang out. I need to keep going and hope other like-minded people will show up. Thank you.</p>

        <p>I post the shit out of stuff on social media especially instagram stories. Know how companies and media bombard people with images to change their thinking ?? I kinda do that but what I do want them to do is start thinking for themselves and waking up. I don’t try to have convos with people necessarily, aside from those who i can talk to about this stuff, or if i see someone post things they’re starting to question, or start convos with me. If people ask if aim having a vax i say honestly and with confidence “pffft! not a chance!” If people want to walk away and not be friends with me over my opinions then i’m ok with that because If rather not waste time having narrow minded people who can’t respect me in my life. A lifelong friend of mine went as far as to relive me on social media because I don’t agree with any of this yet I still wear a mask when out  i just don’t support any of it. She calls such people “selfish and entitled” lol the fuckin irony. My daughter had reaction to her vaccines as an infant, had her last shots at 11 months of age, 11 years ago this august. Since then I’ve become aware of so much since then, and in turn have been in the position you are for years. You find your tribe by speaking your truth. It’s hard and lonely at times but worth it</p>

        <p>Pandemic depression- sounds like you have it. Easy fix is to get a prescription for something. Harder road is to start throwing yourself into exercise, home organization, self-care, academic pursuits. And may I also suggest taking very serious time away from your screens - phone especially. Put down the phone, go for a run to the veg market, get some fresh produce, come home, make salad, smoothie, soup, whatever. Eat it while looking at a book, or out the window. Spend as much time outside, sweating, as possible. You will be immediately feel happier. Doesn’t sound like much but trust me, it works.</p>

        <p>You are definitely not a pussy, you are a human being. This has been a shit show of a time, and the depression and social ostracism is no fucking joke. Especially for someone who has an empathetic and helpful heart, which it sounds like you have. That’s good. The folks who have had an easy time with this are also the ones who are often being cruel and insensitive while claiming to be “saving the world”. Knowing there are people like you, with a good heart and a solid bullshit detector gives me hope in our world. Keep speaking up, even when it’s uncomfortable. You will lose friends, but not the ones worth having. </p>
<p>Sending you lots of love and solidarity</p>

        <p>Yo...I just wanted to say, you’re not alone in feeling the way you do —- and while that may not be much comfort, know also that you’re not alone in THINKING the way you think. THAT more than anything has been a TREMENDOUS comfort for me. Personally I’ve felt weird and alone and possibly insane my entire life, because I’ve never felt like I had much in common with people around me. And I still don’t apparently...but all this dumbness has led me to places like THIS, which is cool. YOU ARE NOT ALONE!!!!! It’ll probably get worse before it gets better in the grand scheme of things...but even when it does...and even when it feels like you are...remember...YOU. ARE. NOT. ALONE. Stay strong. Peace and God speed.</p>

        <p>I've lost a few friends during the pandemic, and BLM riots just for offering a counter view to the narrative they were fed. Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about it, some people can't survive outside of the Matrix. They'll reject reality even if it means stop talking to friends and family, they are more invested in their narrative than their loved ones.</p>
<p>They have been brainwashed to rejected anyone who opposes their view, no matter if they are family or friends.</p>

        <p>Hey buddy, I am so sorry for what you're ging through. Hancock, BoJo, et al have turned your lovely country into dystopian Airstrip One overnight and many people have turned on their family members, friends and neighbours. I honestly do not know how I would have made it through those long, dark lockdowns had I not been a Christian - to say that Jesus saved me from insanity is a gross understatement.</p>
<p>I am not sure how the churches are in the UK - in Cyprus, I have been attending illegal underground services for more than half a year because the restrictions won't be lifted - but I urge you to find a good church where you can nurture your relationship with the Lord Jesus with other people who are not living in irrational, demonically-inspired fear. </p>
<p>I also keep myself busy with hobbies: I learn languages for fun, play bridge, swim, run, cycle, communicate with family (who I haven't seen since Sept 2019), etc. Please don't allow depression and despair to settle in your life. Fight it off!</p>
<p>Oh, and as an ex-gay guy, sex with dudes isn't a good idea. ;)</p>

        <p>You are right. History will show. Not taking the vaccine is to avoid the ADE effect (take a look at all sarscov1 vaccine trials). Covid has a low mortality rate and the experimental vaccine is highrisk. And yes, it’s a hard time... so much people lost their critical thinking only because they want their freedom back which was taken without a cause... and when they will notice that the governments have not the intentions to give the freedom back, they will awake... but then it will be too late ...</p>
