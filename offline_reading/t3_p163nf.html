    <p><p>If the Thalidomide Tragedy occurred today in the day and age of the Internet and social media, how do you think it would play out? How would people react?</p>
<p>If the Tuskegee Syphilis Study occurred today, how would the Internet and social media react?</p>
<p>If Project MKUltra occurred today, how would the Internet and social media react?</p>
<p>If the Cutter Incident occurred today, how would the Internet and social media react?</p>
<p>I could go on and on because history is filled with incidents like these of the government and Pharma screwing people over and/or killing them. There have been many unethical studies done where there was no informed consent, or medical products that were put on the market either without being proven to be safe or actually being known to be unsafe. </p>
<p>Would most people right now believe what was happening or would it all be a giant conspiracy? </p>
<p>Sadly, I think many people would gaslight victims and ignore what was occurring, especially if the government or Pharma denied it. Weâ€™re seeing how these situations would play out with the COVID-19 jab reactions.  Mentions of people having complications from the jab or even dying are being ignored or even scoffed at. Simply asking questions or having a different opinion gets you in trouble now.  </p>
<p>What do you think?</p></p>
