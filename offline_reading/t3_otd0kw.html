        <p>Speaking of this so-called "fact-checking" that some social media platforms recently implemented, how does it work? Are these fact checks done entirely by an AI or there are people that do the checking? The people that do that, do they have to have qualifications and expertise in the field they are fact-checking or do the companies just delegate this job to any random employee? Or better yet, do they just rely on random users from the platform to do the fact-checking? There are so many questions that need to be answered by these companies.</p>

        <p>Journalists with degrees in social work and dyed hair and ear plugs in their mid-20’s who have never worked before tell doctors putting their entire career spanning decades specialising in the precise area, mRNA technology (Dr Robert Malone), heart and kidney specialists (Dr Hoffe) for eg, all at stake, alleging that they’re spreading dangerous misinformation because it doesn’t agree with the narrative that can’t be questioned, without actually addressing the claims with any amount of substance, merely dismissing them because their own High Priests of Science like Fauci have said so, without an iota of acknowledgment of his own conflicts of interest in the subject matter given his likely criminal involvement in state based espionage with the Wuhan Institute of Virology specifically Dr Shi Zhengli… </p>
<p>That was a long sentence…</p>
<p>As the saying goes, it’s better to have questions which can’t be answered than answers which can’t be questioned</p>

        <p>You know .. I have been, up to this point, and still very much am questioning this whole thing... Why else would I be on NNN... but scrolling through my feed and seeing this just now... I realized this is perhaps the 3rd or 4th tweet image capture I've seen from Dr. Malone.  </p>
<p>I think in order to maintain a clear head though all of this it is paramount to not take sides.  Which is why I also frequent places like r/politics and the pro vaccine subs... There's no reason not to.</p>
<p>However, my suspicious mind questions why Dr. Malone hasn't been banned. Like why is his narrative an available one to come across? In my opinion everything that is broadcast is approved... Especially regarding this topic during our present predicament (and it's on Twitter).</p>
<p>I would imagine tptb are controlling the narrative on both sides and that Dr. Robert Malone is no different than Dr. Anthony Fauci... He's just like the anti-Fauci basically... Like every good story needs a proper protagonist and antagonist for whichever side one is experiencing the story from. </p>
<p>I mean c'mon guys... Did you really think the vaccines "being less effective than expected" and everyone having to mask up again wasn't part of the plan? </p>
<p>All I'm saying is that whatever this is all about... It may very well have little to do with covid or a vaccine or even for that matter, the god forsaken microchip I unfortunately keep hearing about... Like maybe all this fear and talk of craziness on both sides is literally all a distraction from something that's being worked on in the background that we all just will have no idea about until it happens.</p>

        <p>Yeah I get it..he speaks as if he doesn't believe he is the property of tptb whereas tptb think oppositely. And I agree that your summary of the main argument here is most likely correct but I like to push myself to think outside the box a little and consider all the possibilities</p>
