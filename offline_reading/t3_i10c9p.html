    <strong>If you're gonna be a mask SJW make sure you're wearing it right</strong>
    <p><p>I'm so sick of this mask bs. If a store is gonna force you to wear one then fine, it's whatever. But if they let you wear a fucking cut up dish rag, a bandana, cloth mask, or a surgical mask with your goddamn nostrils exposed, they're tripping hard. </p>
<p>Like wtf is even the point? To make sure the brainwashed normies feel safe going into Wal-Mart? Safe from a virus that has almost a 0% chance of killing them if they're already healthy? I'm just so done being trapped in my house with nothing to do because the whole world has shut down because of a new strain of the common cold. How can people not see through these lies?</p></p>

        <p>I see that a LOT at the home Depot near me. During a heated discussion about dishwashers the other day me and the appliance sales guy both ditched our masks just because mumbled mask speak wasn't working.</p>

        <p>Surgical masks don't help.  They never have.  They won't protect you even if you're wearing it correctly.  The ONLY function of a surgical mask is to stop you from coughing or sneezing onto someone else.  That's all they were ever designed to do.  If you cannot talk without spittle flying out of your mouth, then yes; a surgical mask will help.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/top-suppliers/surgical-mask-manufacturer-suppliers/">https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/top-suppliers/surgical-mask-manufacturer-suppliers/</a> </p>
<p>" Certain masks are designed for higher risk environments than others. It’s important to remember, however, that a mask alone will not provide protection from COVID-19. Masks, gloves, and other PPE are needed in combination to protect the wearer, as well as basic practices such as hand washing and not touching the face. It’s also important to reserve the most protective masks for healthcare workers, who spend long periods of time in the highest risk areas for contagion. "</p>
<p>Surgical Masks are for low risk environments.  They won't stop covid-19.  An N-95 mask is slightly better, but that has to be properly fitted- and how many people do you know who do that?  Cloth masks are flat out bullshit.  It doesn't matter how you wear a surgical or cloth mask especially if you're reusing them.  You're supposed to throw away surgical masks every single day.</p>
<p>So no- it doesn't matter how they use them- they won't save you or anyone else.  The only reason we're not seeing mass deaths is because the danger from this virus has passed.  It's all for show now.</p>

        <p>They can't force anyone to put on a mask.  It's a choice to use your arms/hands and put shit on your face. Not disagreeing with you but the I want to be clear on what is force and what is not.</p>

        <p>It's no coincidence that the big techies are having gangbuster profits: <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/four-big-tech-stocks-add-214-billion-in-market-value-after-crushing-analyst-estimates-51596153411">https://www.barrons.com/articles/four-big-tech-stocks-add-214-billion-in-market-value-after-crushing-analyst-estimates-51596153411</a></p>
<p>The gatekeepers of censorship make fortunes when people are forced to put a halitosis diaper on their face to leave the house.</p>
<p>You've gotta be a dum-dum to think widespread masking cures coronavirus, but the big tech 50 cent army have birthed the 'we're in this together' conformity brigade. They feed on division and are happy to see society implode, especially if in the end they're clutching the bag of gold coins and we're kissing them hem of their robes.</p>

        <p>Atleast you can still breathe with your nose in that way. It is still humorous when the person scolding you is wearing a towel in front of his face. I mean atleast it is still unintentionally hilarious.</p>
