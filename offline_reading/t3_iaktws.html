    <strong>Wisconsin Mask Mandate</strong>
    <p><p>My friend and I live in Minnesota, which is just a nightmare all around, but we're close enough to the border of Wisconsin that we can easily go over there to go to the gun range. We had originally started doing that once MN started mandating masks, but now since WI has a mandate too we were curious how things would be. Well I have to report that I am pleasantly surprised. At the gun range the employees were wearing it down under their chin and I'd say 85% of the people there to shoot wore a mask in but then took them off when the went to shoot. Also we went to get food and went to a store after and i saw multiple people just not wearing them at all. Recently I have been getting really down in the dumps because of how everyone one seems to be blindly obeying anything they are told without so much as a question. But some of my hope was renewed today. It was nice to see others like me out and about in public. Stay strong and continue the fight!</p></p>

        <p>I live in Central, the only time I've ever worn a fucking mask is in a grocery store where they are being forced, everywhere else no one is wearing the fucking things. And a lot of restaurants and bars are not enforcing it either.</p>

<p>Wisconsin is one of the states that I'm researching for moving purposes, and I definitely don't want to remain in the leftist hell hole of CA so I'm definitely not looking for a leftist echochamber. And it would help knowing where all the doomers in WI are so I can avoid them</p>

        <p>I think we are gonna have to look past right-left loyalties in the future if we want to make any progress. Outside of certian pockets like Dane County, no one in Wisconsin gives a fuck about left-right politics, which is why I love living here.</p>

        <p>Evers is a whiny bitch with the mentality of a bratty child, he only went out of his way to bypass the previous SCOWI verdict by declaring a second health emergency to force masks because he didn't get his way with the lockdowns. He's a complete total clown, outside of Dane County and parts of Milwaukee County no one takes the fucker seriously anymore, he's basically a laughing stock to people on both sides of the political aisle around here.</p>

        <p>I think the big difference here is that Evers was already wildly unpopular when he was running but only won because he was going against an even more wildly unpopular standing governor and even then he only won unexpectedly by a hair.</p>
<p>He's always been a clown.</p>

        <p>He bypassed it by declaring another health emergency (which is pretty much bullshit, since he already used up his COVID health emergency), he also waited for his pet justice to get into office before doing so. </p>
<p>Unfortunately it seems the state legislature has been do-nothing this time and there are some rumors that they've caved, which I am hoping isn't the case. But regardless this clown has shown to be such a weak leader with the mentality of a whiny little spoiled brat so I highly doubt he will get re-elected.</p>

        <p>I dont know if it is or not. We currently have around a total of 65,000 cases. But more than 80% of our 1700 fatalities have been in long term care facilities. So i think instead of a mask madate we should have been protecting our nursing homes.</p>
