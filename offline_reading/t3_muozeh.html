    <strong>Chauvin trial...</strong>
    <p><p>You know what’s interesting? The defense and prosecution spent combined millions on different medical experts arguing the cause of death. They argued for days on whether a knee on the neck caused the death, or whether it was the drugs, the heart disease he had, “excited delirium”, even partial CO poisoning. This isn’t the sub to debate that part of things, and not what this post is about. </p>
<p>You know what hardly got brought up at all, only in passing? COVID. The defense didn’t even mention it in their closing argument, and while I didn’t watch the whole trial, I barely saw it mentioned at all by the defense. </p>
<p>Floyd tested positive for COVID one month before the incident, and was still testing positive for it after his death. A virus that’s so deadly, yet the defense attorney doesn’t even bring it up despite his client having comorbidities including heart disease. What happened to all the medical science that even young healthy people who recover from COVID have “permanent lung damage” and other “long covid” fairy tales? Apparently they didn’t think COVID playing a role in Floyd’s death could even cause reasonable doubt for the jury. I think that says a lot.</p></p>

        <p>This is around the time that the pandemic lost my attention.  It was clear, at that time, that media needed to make a scapegoat, for their political influence, and pandemic lost THEIR attention, if only briefly, for a time, as well.  </p>
<p>When I saw that, BLM and social justice became another political ploy, to me.</p>

        <p>Yep this is when I stopped caring. I wear a mask at work because my employer requires it and is within their right to. I put it on if a business requires it because it’s their right to. </p>
<p>When people in Michigan are called terrorists who are undeserving of healthcare because “they want haircuts” and meanwhile BLM is allowed to riot and pillage the entire country for months on end and they literally try to argue its helping end COVID it is just clear that this is more political than medical.</p>

        <p>Do you disagree with the statistical fact that Covid cases went down in the areas of mass protests, or do you disagree with news outlets offering lose speculation of possible explanations of that fact?</p>
<p>Do you deny that riots occurred? Why do you oppose "Riots basically forced a quarantine" speculation?</p>

        <p>Huh?</p>
<p>The point is, if the mainstream narrative is correct (which it isn't), then the BLM riots should have produced a spike in cases.</p>
<p>Either it didn't, and the media is full of shit about covid <em>as a whole,</em> or it did, and they're lying about it for political reasons.</p>

        <p>He's got it right though. The article makes a factual claim (not sure if true or not, but I mean it's not an opinion) that cases went down in places that had BLM protests.  It then speculates that the cause of this downturn is people too scared to go out because of the protests, which had a net effect of lowering community mixing.  The hypothesis isn't tested, but it's at least feasible.</p>
<p>Not that any such thing would justify either riots or lockouts, but it's always good to understand reality.</p>

        <p>You're claiming that the mainstream media narrative(That quarantining works) contradicts the claim that the decreased traffic and public activity from the riots reduced cases.</p>

        <p>Thousands or tens of thousands of people, mixing it up in crowds, many un-masked, would've been called a "super-spreader event" if it had been anything other than a Left-wing protest.</p>
<p>And then they circle back after the fact, with, "hey, we weren't wrong in not condemning the riots, because look -- cases went down! It must be because everyone was too scared to go outside." Except that cases also went down in most states, because coronavirus is seasonally less active in warmer months.</p>
<p>It's patently obvious the media is just making shit up. They want coronavirus to be super serious, but only when convenient.</p>

        <p>The jury started their deliberations yesterday. It'll probably be today or tomorrow based on just how big of a verdict this is.</p>
<p>This may sound whatever but I think they are going to make Chauvin fall on the sword because if he is acquitted, the riots last summer are gonna look like childs play.</p>

        <p>It's pathetic that that's what this country has come to. Instead of a fair judgement on whether or not someone is truly innocent or guilty, have to make decisions based on other people's predicted emotional responses. Regardless of what side you're on, that's just wrong.</p>

        <p>I actually disagree with you.</p>
<p>As petty as it sounds, the kind of crowd that sparks these riots up, is as fickle as the weather.  And the weather is going to be cold, for April.  I think it goes off, should there be anything less than a satisfactory verdict in their minds, as a non-news story.  Middle of summer?  Sure. But with a cold snap, much less physical attention paid to it.  Media will try to stir the pot, but it just won't register in the scale it did last summer.</p>

        <p>Another thing I’ve seen rarely discussed: that event occurred in May 2020, when a lot of people still couldn’t even get a haircut, let alone go out to a bar or restaurant. Everything was closed. Everything was uncertain. Election tension was high. There are plenty of idiots still out there to do damage, but May 2020 was a bad time for civil unrest, and I don’t think you have the same “lightning in a bottle” today.</p>

        <p>I don’t think there is any set date or time, especially for such a high profile case.  They deliberated for some hours today (yesterday, I’m up late!).  Should be delivered when they come to a unanimous verdict.  I try to avoid the media updates but it’s a pretty difficult task.</p>

        <p>The jury just went in to deliberating yesterday at about 4pm. They were allowed to go until 7pm if they chose. I wouldn't even venture a guess as to how long. No way to know outside of the jury room.</p>

        <p>This right here. The deadliest virus pandemic and it's not mentioned. They're trying to play the socio-economic card. The race card. Etc. These arguments seem to entice more emotion from people. It's very possible that he was having 'long-covid' symptoms or whatever you call it. The defense should have used this to create even MORE reasonable doubt.</p>

        <p>I completely agree based on a case-by-case scenario. I don't have a dog in the fight really, other than it sets a scary precedence. I do think there are other contributing factors in this particular case, but those will be shadowed by an onslaught of other politicized issues.</p>

<p>This man should be studied by Almighty Science as the only human being to have contracted Covid, died, and not had Covid marked as his cause of death.  Why?  Perhaps they can make a vaccine derived from Floyd's obviously superior DNA.</p>

        <p>I 100% agree that it doesn’t kill people like that, especially not younger people.</p>
<p>A lot of Reddit seems to disagree and the amount of times I’ve heard “long covid” and how terrible it is on this website is insane. Literally people on /r/coronavirus promote that nearly everyone that gets covid, even asymptomatic ones, will have lifetime disabilities. Some “experts” even agree with this crowd.</p>
<p>To be clear I 100% don’t believe coronavirus killed floyd, but it’s telling that in such a trial his defense didn’t even press it as a contributing factor to death. Really flies in the face of the covid doomers. That’s all this post is about.</p>

        <p>The r/covidlonghaulers should be taken off Reddit. I actually feel bad for SOME of those people. They make each other feel worse about their imaginary symptoms. IMO, some are suffering from real depression and anxiety but not exactly from extended covid. One lady admitted that "exercise makes her symptoms worse". &lt;&lt;&lt;LOL</p>

        <p>Last Summer, I worked for a company boarding up buildings that had been looted and/or burned on the South &amp; West sides of Chicago. The police looked "shell shocked" and defeated as they drove by. The amount of destruction wasn't always shown on the news. Dr. Fauci is probably disappointed that he won't be able to get much "air time" this week. The typical, selfish, Covid doomers will be upset that Covid will not be getting as much air time this week either.</p>

        <p>In the late 90's, I was a teenager and stopped as a passenger in a stolen car. The Chicago Police beat me to a pulp. I was so injured that the jail would not accept me. Luckily, a suburban police agency saw the beating and filed a complaint. I won a law suit. YES, I was in a stolen car, NO, I should not of been beaten. Fck 12    CPDK</p>

        <p>Here's the deal in my humble opinion. This goes way beyond George Floyd, Derek Chauvin or even racism. What is critical is the verdict, Derek Chauvin has been found guilty, and you know who supports this verdict, Joe Biden. The past year we have seen everything politicized and polarized, especially the Pandemic, and it has come down to simply Democrats believe and Republican's deny.. This guilty verdict under the applauding of Joe Biden reinforces to all these radicals that Joe and the Democrats are the right people and therefore can do no wrong. With this Verdict, they have solidified a civilian army moving forward. If the verdict had gone the other way, then all the Radicals who have sworn their allegiance to Joe and company would now be turning against them and they would lose the leverage that these people bring to the table. </p>
<p>They are moving the pieces around the board and pretty soon it's going to be "checkmate" for everyone.  </p>
