    <strong>Do I chose family or freedom?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not getting this vax. I live in NY suburbs an hour away from NYC. These new mandates are freaking me out a bit. I'm not in the city but who knows when they'll start making it a state wide thing. I can live without restaurants, gyms, entertainment venues. But who knows if they'll extend it further to grocery, parks, ect.  </p>
<p>I'm trying to decide if it comes to that do I move and leave all my family and friends behind? I have a big family and we are all very close and we get together often but I know the rest of them aren't willing to move since they're tied down to jobs even though we're all on the same page when it comes to covid and the vax. I have a one year old son who loves his grandparents and I've always wanted him to grow up around them and all his relatives since it was something I never had growing up. All my closest friends just had kids too. </p>
<p>I feel torn. If it gets bad do I leave them all behind? I don't think I'd ever give in and just take the jab. Although I can't say the same for my husband. 
Anyone else facing a similar dilemma?</p></p>
