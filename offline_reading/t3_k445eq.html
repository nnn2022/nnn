    <strong>Has anyone noticed the double standard with entertainment?</strong>
    <p><p>Why do pro-maskers not care about the social elite “spreading the virus and killing people selfishly”?</p>
<p><em>A couple of examples that made me scratch my head:</em></p>
<p>Local news stations sitting in studio, maskless, urging others to follow usual criteria.</p>
<p>YouTube channels based in large cities. Specifically GMM, a family friendly show based in LA. When this first started they made their content separately from home, and did their bit about the importance of masks, but now no one cares when they bite into the same slice of cake, prepared by their cook, and brought to them by an intern. </p>
<p>Football players? Fuck ‘em. They don’t count either. But you’re damn skippy the coaches need them.</p>
<p>Kevin Hart’s special made in his own home. The crowd is wearing masks, and he’s not. He even tells them he already had it, and a couple of people gasped, but NOBODY was concerned enough to leave.</p>
<p>All of these types of social circles are exempt, and mask people are just blindly all for accepting that they’re the diseased normies, and the social elite they idolize could <em>never</em> catch a cold.</p>
<p>Has anyone heard a counterpart to this argument? 
Any time I’ve tried to get a clear answer from a pro-masker, they’ve always responded with something regarding their emotional state with “everything going on”, and they don’t have time to worry about it.</p></p>

        <p>I’m gonna respond to each of these points individually. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Local news stations. 
Can’t speak for your particular local news, but most large news station anchors are wearing masks almost constantly, only taking them off when they sit down to film. Their seats are at least 6 feet away from other anchors and from the camera crew. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vloggers. 
I don’t watch this particular channel, but if they have a private chef and an intern, they probably spend enough time with them that they would be considered part of the family unit. Same as how parents and their kids obviously don’t wear masks around each other. They’re quarantining as a group. They also may just be ignoring guidelines, idk I don’t watch their channel. I’m just going off what you’ve said. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Football players. Most people are against sports right now, but some measures have been taken to make things more safe. I believe all players have quarantined for 14 days before being allowed to begin training or participate. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can’t speak for him, didn’t watch his special and couldn’t find it online from the quick googling I just did. However if he was six feet away from the crowd I don’t see why they would be concerned. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve commented in this sub before and gotten overly aggressive responses, so I’d like to preemptively ask people to respond to this in a civil manner. I’m willing to further talk about this so long as people argue rationally and don’t just name call.</p>

        <p>And not to mention that <em>families</em> are being advised not to gather more than 6 at a time, why on God's green Earth would that not apply to businesses that have already shown they're capable of doing it from home? </p>
<p>C'mon now. Even pro-mask political figures are being called out for having dinners and events. The hypocrisy is blatantly accepted among that side of the stance. They don't even try to acknowledge the double standard. </p>
<p>Its a social acceptance people are conforming to because they don't want to be outcasted by their peers. They are dehumanizing us and its sad and shocking to see the herd just file in without questioning whether this is practical or not.</p>

        <p>Just have to say that most people aren't "against sports" right now. Maybe hard core doomers who have a wildly incorrect understanding of how deadly this virus is, are against sports. But outside that out of touch bubble, most people are very happy that sports are going on. People are watching them, and millions would attend games if permitted. Parents are putting their kids in sports and watching the games. The people who are against sports now most likely never cared about sports before.</p>

        <p>I disagree with the vlog argument 1000%. If they don't live under the same roof, they're still coworkers with their own lives and their own families. At the end of the day, if they're being snobs about masks, it shouldn't matter how well they get along, they should practice what they preach or stop acting like masks sre going to prevent the black plague. </p>
<p>Same can be applied to sports, dancers, news casts, etc. </p>
<p>What's the point in self quarantine if you're just going to be sweating and running with other athletes? Its not like healthy young adults are waking up and realizing they're sick, when you dont start noticing symptoms after so many days.</p>
<p>I can get back to you on the Kevin Hart special if you want link or something, it was on either Netflix or Prime Video. I couldn't even tell you if it was any good TBH bc I fell asleep. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, all points listed still come off as "here is why its okay for these guys to do it"</p>

        <p>Sounds like a bad cold to me. I've had terrible colds in my life where I could barely breathe. You realize that the vast majority of people experience this disease as a mild cold, or they are completely asymptomatic. </p>
<p>No one is stopping you from wearing a mask. Wear 2 masks. Wear a hazmat suit. If that makes you feel better about yourself, more power to you. Just don't pretend that covid is the black death when you know it's not. Yes, it can be a pretty nasty cold, but having a bad cold once in awhile is unfortunately part of being a human being and living on this planet.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's also a virus, not a disease. 
I used a hyperbole to signify the severity of the situation when a normal person is getting milk unmasked, versus social elite doing it no problem.</p>
