    <strong>Would the best response have been to just tell elderly/those with pre-ex's to stay home and let the CoVid-19 virus rip through society?</strong>
    <p><p>I am serious here. I lost my parents to this virus due to the negligence of a rehab center. My 69 year old mother and I were sequestering and that was letting us avoid CoVid-19 until that g'damned rehab center sent Dad home to us with this disease.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that the best thing to do with the known IFR of this disease would have been to just allow it to rip through society, intentionally exposing everyone in good health and not living with those two groups aforementioned, and getting herd immunity as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Doing lockdowns and masks just drug out the inevitable and might even be harming us by allowing people who caught this in March to be reinfected now that their immunity is coming to the end of the most pessimistic estimates of immunity to coronaviruses like CoVid-19.</p></p>

        <p>By doing what you suggest, we would have reached herd immunity 6 months ago, minus the economic devastation and suicide increases, domestic and drug abuse, depression and social desperation.</p>

        <p>I agree, I think this is the only way as well. As an American, even if this was in the movies, super lethal, fall over dead when you open your front door deadly, my rights should still apply. Doesnt make it right for government to deem who is "essential" to society.</p>

        <p>Yes. Regardless of the number of bodies (sounds horrible, I know), 1% of the population is just not statistically significant. Pair that with the fact that there really are no excessive death counts in 2020, and all the negative impacts of lockdowns generally, fewer people will have died if we took the do-nothing-but-be-pragmatic approach from the get-go.</p>

        <p>Yes, especially at this point getting close to a year since this all started. Open everything up to full capacity. This virus is NOT going away. No matter how hard you try, it spreads like wildfire. It's time to let people make their own choices regarding their lives. </p>
<p>Hell, I looked this up the other day. With Ebola, they did lock down Sierra Leone. However it was criticized and called "heavy handed". Lockdowns and masks happen when you scare all the people who have felt so incredibly safe their entire lives. They cannot fathom that anything could kill them. Its the same people who a year ago would say "Live life to the fullest". Yeah this is that for sure...</p>
<p>We need to start thinking more critically now. Stop the blanket policies</p>

        <p>Yes, considering this virus apparently already hit North America as early as December (and probably even earlier) and most of us weathered through it with no lockdown, no masks, no distancing.</p>

<p>I lost two loved ones, a friend in her early 40s and my aunt in her 70s and both times it was because of separate health issues that weren't being looked at because all of this coronavirus mismanagement.</p>
<p>I feel ya. Sending good vibes ðŸ’•</p>
