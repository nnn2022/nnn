    <strong>My family treats me like shit when it comes to covid</strong>
    <p><p>Im sure you guys are probably experiencing the same as i am but i was just here to vent, because honestly ive been mentally abused by my family for sure, primarily from my close family. My mother and father....and my brother somewhat have been trying nagging me getting the vaccine because they are following the narrative from the MSM that if you get the Vaccine you can socialize with people.....which just gets me so angry. I had my bloodwork done for something unrelated to covid and i asked someone whos a nurse there who actually works with me in another job and asked her if they look at anti-bodies and she said they do. So i kinda took that information and told my parents that i dont need the vaccine because i probably have anti-bodies. Saying this, my dad wanted me to show proof, because clearly they dont take my word for it. I didnt really bother doing that because i dont feel like i shouldnt have to prove it to them. My parents are at the point where basically they are deep into the fear mongering that even tho im not sick or have been sick for most of late 2020 and even early parts of 2021, they still think im a carrier even tho i keep trying to explain to them that Asymptomatic is basically not a case of a virus going around.</p>
<p>So now, im in a spot where i feel like i shouldnt be taking this abuse from my family because they are being psychos. Basically they want me to either get the vaccine or else im basically exiled from anything, i kinda understand why suicide spiked and its abusive shit like this. im guessing you guys have been experiencing this?</p></p>

        <p>i’m going through the same thing, being told i’ll be “the only member of the family not to get it” and using any social tactics they can. any research i show them is considered misinformation so i can’t win either way :( stay strong, my friend</p>

        <p>The vax is being pushed with fear to us all. We don’t know what’s in it. There are alternatives to the vaccine. Richest get richer, we just follow rules blindly. Stop, take a look around and think. Look at the numbers. Think again. Are we being fooled?</p>

        <p>Have always been encouraged for debate, investigate and follow my intuition when it comes to “forbidden topics” - except for now. Whenever I find articles which are so clear as to what’s going on and share with them, they have no time or patience to read into it. They are actively denying hearing the other side on the debate. What the actual fuck?</p>

        <p>Honest question - why are you guys putting up with this shit?</p>
<p>Just bc they're your family doesn't give them any right to mock, coerce, shame or abuse you. If it was anyone but your family would you put up with it at all?</p>
<p>Take yourself out of these situations and go low to no contact. They're the ones wrecking your trust and taking advantage of you wanting to keep the family together - not you.</p>
<p>I'm someone who was raised by a malignant narcissist and have gone full no contact so maybe this seems more obvious to me than others. But just know you do NOT deserve this treatment from anyone!</p>

        <p>It’s hard when all you have is family. My best friends have moved out of state and although I talk to them I don’t actually see them. Families are doing this in hopes it will work. Exiling us is something they know will hurt because otherwise we will be somewhat alone. I have my fiancé, but that’s it and he works a lot. My family does ask me to do things but harasses me about the vaccine every time. It’s just really hard. I am honestly understanding why the suicide rate is going up too. It really fucks with you.</p>

        <p>But ask yourself- what is family supposed to mean?</p>
<p>Love, respect, companionship, trust etc</p>
<p>Your family is actively ruining those things and holding them hostage.</p>
<p>Do you really believe their actions are loving? Do they help you trust them? Do you feel respected? </p>
<p>Don't let them hold it over your head. Disengage from them without burning bridges.</p>
<p>If they truly are people who love you,respect you, want the best for you etc they will be back. </p>
<p>Walking alone does not mean being lonely.</p>
<p>If these people are treating you so badly you feel like committing suicide, break contact. Your mental health will thank you for it.</p>
<p>Also, narcissists are people who try to purposely put you outside of the pack and force you to be alone because it gives them power. Healthy people do not do this to others.</p>
<p>If you ever want to pm me you can. I lost almost everyone when I went NC with my mother last year. My mental health and lifestyle have never been better. Yes it hurt bad for a bit, but it is far better than abuse.</p>

        <p>You’re right, it really is manipulation and control. The insults, mocking, respect of boundaries. I believe my mom has BPD and/or covert narcissism. Sometimes they don’t harass me directly, just make passive aggressive comments like “well since we are all vaccinated we can do this” or “you really need to wear a mask since you’re not vaccinated”, etc. I have been in therapy with a wonderful woman who has brought my attention to this manipulation. Withdrawal of affection, passive aggressive jabs etc. Although they do still invite me to do things, it’s always brought up in some way. I’m a “conspiracy theorist” or “internet doctor”, or “how did this happen to you”. Really makes me feel so awful, I’m sensitive which sucks and pregnant on top of it and emotional. 
Thank you for saying I could message you if needed it honestly means a lot. I’m so glad you were able to disengage from a narcissistic mother. I know that was probably very hard but needed.</p>

        <p>Dealing with the same. I have no useful advice except for that I am planning to cut off contact if they don’t stop. I’ve already been told I’m not allowed to attend Thanksgiving, which makes me feel like my “family” is not my family. Fine. They’re risking never seeing me again, hope it’s worth it to them.</p>

        <p>Have been feeling like shit, sick, and they have been ignoring it - until I was in the hospital for 4 hours yesterday, diagnosed with bronchitis, very close to an actual pneumonia. They just fucking ignored it until I came from the hospital. Am I going crazy? How do you guys deal with this shit with your families?</p>

        <p>So, update: not covid. 4 different diagnosis, on women from 1 to 57 years old. Faringitis, otitis, bronchitis and sinusitis. At the same time, all were unwell before except for me, I was already sneezy and cough before, attributed it to an aggressive allergy attack..</p>
