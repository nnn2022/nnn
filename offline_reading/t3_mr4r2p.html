    <strong>I was going for a walk in the woods when I saw....</strong>
    <p><p>A guy wearing two masks and gloves waking his dog.... why do people do this. I laugh when I see this but it truly worries me. And a couple days before there was a family of like 7 all wearing masks while outdoors. It worries me about kids too not being able to see peoples faces</p></p>

        <p>I passed a family on my hike this weekend that was the most bizarre display of fear I have ever seen. They were all wrapped in plastic tarps, with double masks. The dad had his arms wrapped around his wife and two teenage sized kids pressed against his chest. Their faces were buried in his chest. The were as far smooshed into the bushes on the wall of the trail as they could be. They were all literally trembling. Minus the plastic, this is exactly how I would picture a family looking as the water filled their cabin as the Titanic sank.</p>

        <p>Some people depress me. Even after Covid is over (if it ever is) I bet some freaks will still do this. It's funny and sad at the same time</p>

        <p>I saw some kids in my neighborhood running around having a nerf battle... without masks... It  was incredible. But I can't help but get Terminator 2 vibes like Sarah Conner envisioning the playground and then the nuclear blast burns them all. That could be the last time I ever see kids playing normally without masks for all I know. This IS a sci-fi dystopian horror film we are living in and it wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the MASSES of people who fucking cling to their vapid bullshit and still talk sports and pop culture as if the world isn't being taken over by a faceless, demonic, technocratic elite who wants to kill, maim, or enslave each and every one of us and remove even the concept of freedom from the human mind. These vacuous slugs are what make it that much more unbearable. I think at this point they could have covid gestapo dressed in leather on every block demanding to see proof of vaccination and they would still believe it is for their safety and that we in this sub and who think like us are the dangerous ones!</p>

        <p>Because despite what they may think, those types of people are really <em>that</em> stupid and fearful. </p>
<p>I mean remember. These people think that that <em>they</em> are the ones acting normal and everyone else are raging lunatics.</p>

        <p>I was at a beach in Seattle last couple afternoons. 80% of people were masked, kids included. It's a spacious, open area. Yet people look at me with consternation.</p>
