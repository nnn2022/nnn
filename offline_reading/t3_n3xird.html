    <strong>Kicked out of furniture store for not wearing mask</strong>
    <p><p>Live in Florida.  I was kicked out of City Furniture this weekend for not wearing a mask.  I haven't been masking up anywhere for a couple weeks now, since anyone over the age of 16 who wants a vaccine has had it available for over a month now.  Every store still has a mask sign up, but this is the first place to actually enforce it, which is even more pointless given it's a 100,000 sq ft store with like 8 people in it.</p>
<p>Anyway, this got me to thinking about how to finally end all this mask bullshit.  People mostly just follow the rules that the stores have.  Stores keep a mask mandate because it's the CDC guidance and they are more afraid of the loonies than losing business due to forcing masks.  And it's obvious that the feds/CDC aren't going to roll back guidance on masks indoors anytime soon, if ever.  So how does this end?  </p>
<p>I decided I can just avoid companies that enforce their mask policy.  The furniture place lost $3k in revenue that day as we were ready to buy a set, but they may calculate that they'd lose more from spooked customers who need the psychological comfort of masks.  Is there anything more one can do to help return our country to normal?</p></p>

        <p>And, rest assured, they value the almighty $$ than they will EVER value your personal health, or the health of anyone in that store, including employees.</p>
<p>Especially a furniture store, which are a dime a dozen, and seem to always be having a "closing sale".  Eyeroll.</p>

        <p>I think that’s about all we can do. I’ve just recently started no masking wherever I go, but I’m going to start adding in leaving peacefully whenever they ask me to mask up. I’m not gonna make a big deal of it otherwise it’ll just encourage the idea that anti maskers are a bunch of loonies. Just gonna respectfully say okay, and leave and they don’t get my business. Unfortunately it’s one of those situations that if you do more it just encourages the stereotype. It’s either be respectful and leave, or go all out balls to the walls and start a revolution. And people in America are too lazy for revolution, so I’m just sticking to the respectful boycotting approach.</p>

        <p>I agree in not making a scene.  We just kind of laughed and asked if they were vaccinated.  The guy said he thought it was a stupid policy, but they had to enforce it.  I don't know if their corporate is super strict, or if this guy is just a nut.  I mean, there were a handful of other employees that saw us and didn't say a thing.  Either way, I'm mostly taking a friendly approach to this.  Just act genuinely surprised that they'd be worried given over half the state is vaccinated and let them know you'll take your business elsewhere.  The message will come across eventually.</p>

        <p>Half your state isnt vaccinated, you shouldn't spread lies. Maine is the most vaccinated state and they just hit 40% a few days ago. Most southern states are around 20%.</p>

        <p>So it's only 30%.  Big deal.  Every single adult that wants a vaccine has a vaccine.  It has been open for everyone for over a month.</p>
<p>Edit: Just noticed that for the adult population, vaccination is at 50%, with another 20% having completed their first dose.  Do you adjust your opinion now that you realize you have been looking at total vaccination instead of adult, or do you just shift the goalposts in your mind automatically?</p>

        <p>Ok, so it's the latter for you then.  If you notice, every time they mention vaccination rates, it's of the adult population.  Because, you know, only adults are eligible for the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Regardless of what your opinion is of stupid(irrelevant), this is the answer to your question. The whiners can drag this out as long as they want. The adults would like to get back to normal though. Try to keep up.</p>

        <p>Companies just need to believe that removing mask requirements is in their best interest.  They need to see people spending money elsewhere and avoiding their stores (and understand why).  Unfortunately, if their legal team assumes they'll see a handful of covid-related lawsuits, it takes a lot of lost couch sales to offset that risk.</p>
<p>I do make sure I let stores/restaurants know when I walk in or call that I'll be going elsewhere because of their rules.  If enough do this, and most importantly, if we spend our money at places without these rules, it will start to make an impact.</p>
<p>I'm still looking for a restaurant in maine/NH to support with my money.  Even a "we're complying with the letter, barely, but we despise our dictator" mentality would garner my support.</p>

<p>It's that last part that is tricky.  I wonder if an app that lets people crowdsource info on which stores are maskless-friendly would help.  If enough people got on board and it took off, companies would be able to see proof that enforcing masks is hurting.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's been discussed, but the policing effort on such an app would be monstrous.  Anti-trolling, out of date information, feedback from stores who disagree with how they were represented.  You're basically building yelp at that point.  Otherwise, yes, it would really help.</p>
<p>Co-opting an existing review app/site that doesn't just censor/ban for anti-lockdown sentiment would be the easiest approach, if one could be found.</p>

        <p>Yeah they actually rolled back restrictions here and when I mentioned it to a business (who had some stringent policies in place that quite frankly made me uncomfortable) I got a snarky tone in response " Well its OUR store" cool bitch, I'll buy my 3500 speaker system from someone else.

        <p>My wife and I went into a Target (gulp) yesterday evening.  We were two of a very few, who did not have masks on.  She's gotten more on board with me about that, even though she's the one that convinced me to get the pfizer shot.  So, we are trying to meet in the middle, I guess.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did see a handful of few other patrons not wearing masks.  Most were.  Target wants it, and might even have you thinking that they "require" masks.  Been in there about 30 minutes at this point, and I've got 700.00 worth of merch in my cart (bought a boxed mattress for a spare bedroom bed, that needed it).  Loudspeaker comes on, and some snowflake mentions that "masks are asked to be worn" and if you choose not to, "keep in mind our curbside and home delivery options".  Suck it, Target.  Kept doing what I was doing.  Hate that I gave them that much money for their junk, but I just hate Wal Mart that much, and don't have a ton of other options, for some things.</p>

        <p>That’s crazy you mention target. I walked in yesterday with no mask and I was the only one without one. It was packed. Within 15 seconds of me entering, the loudspeaker came on and they announced that “for everyone’s safety, masks need to be worn or please use curbside”. It was eerie how quick that message hit the speakers. Target must have cameras on the entrance, or those useless clowns that stand there and greet you are reporting it.</p>

        <p>I actually didn't think of it as a recording, and more of being some snarky-ass employee, being told by higher ups, what to do.  The Target I was at, wasn't crowded in any way, especially for a Sunday evening.  In fact, I personally think much of my metro area is still sheltered in place, or just left.  I'm not seeing many people ANYWHERE, except the damn county fair, which was jam packed with the kind of people you'd normally expect to see at the fair, including myself.  I felt like a turd in a punchbowl.  </p>
<p>I don't think crowds are returning to many places I used to expect them.  If ever.</p>

        <p>The loudspeaker at my target yesterday was definitely an employee and not a recording, and it happened almost as soon as I entered the building. Super passive aggressive and weird. I felt like it was aimed at me. It was your typical Sunday crowd, kids running everywhere. Families. All wearing masks. Could have been coincidental but man I felt singled out. I grabbed my stuff and was out in 5 minutes. Won’t be going back.</p>

        <p>I'm in MO, but I've found that a lot of businesses that "require" masks just have the sign up as appeasement (or because corporate told them to) and many employees do not care. Regional grocery chain here has signs requiring masks, but I have never shopped there with a mask. I even ran into the manager and he just wished me a nice day and moved on. My approach right now is to just ignore the sign. If an employee stops me and says it's required, tell them I don't have one. If they still insist, politely leave. I haven't had to wear a mask at Dierbergs, Dollar General, Target, Walmart, or Walgreens even though they all "require it." I'm sure the results are regional, but it's always worth a try IMO.</p>

        <p>Hang in there, my dude. Again, I'm sure it varies place to place, but even an employee stopping someone isn't much of a confrontation unless you allow it to escalate. It's almost always just the question,"Do you have a mask, sir?"  If you say no, they'll say it's required and you nod, say thank you, and leave. No one has been mean or rude to me, and I do the same for them. But the vast majority of the time no one has said anything to me. I walked past a girl who wrapped a sweatshirt around her head so she could buy a pack of masks at the front of Dollar General so she could feel safe shopping in the rest of the store and the cashier just nodded hello to me. I've been the only one not wearing a mask at Dierbergs for months, but just the other day I saw two more people and it made me so happy. Every little bit makes a difference.</p>

        <p>Definitely. Everything you said gives me hope that there’s people like us. Silent majority. I witnessed a Kroger employee (older female) scream at the top of her lungs towards a mom and a kid for not wearing one and chasing them out of the store. To this day it haunts me that I didn’t say anything or I didn’t step in. Gah. But you’re absolutely right, I always ask nicely, do I need to wear a mask and if the answer is yes, I say okay thank you bye. It’s just discouraging because they have more of the ppl who want masks so our business doesn’t mean much to theM. 🤷🏽‍♀️.</p>

        <p>I've noticed where I live there are more people getting lax about masks. For instance, at the gym I've noticed more people with their noses hanging out, especially when doing more stressful exercise. In general I've noticed more people pulling their masks down for a more extended period of time.</p>

        <p>I live in Northern Virginia and decided to ditch the mask. I am literally the only one not wearing a mask inside stores (and sometimes even outdoor), compliance here is 100%. The only time a staff complained I said I didn't have a mask and they let go. Am I lucky? Maybe because the 100% compliance, staff is not prepared to handle no maskers? Anyway, I recommend trying it out, just ditch the mask and live your life, even if you are in a very restrictive place. Anyone from Northern Virginia here who has a similar experience?</p>

        <p>Every propagandist knows from Edward Bernays to Hitler, to Mao, that you get the young women to follow you first... then they will have kids and blend regular childhood fun and nursery rhymes with propaganda... and then the men will follow after that because the men want access to the women.  Men who go against the system will generally become incels even if they are otherwise men of quality and character.  </p>
<p>The women are too perpetually afraid today to be with a man who will walk into a Walmart without a mask on.</p>

<p>Yeah, no shit they have the right to refuse service.  At what point in my post did you get the notion that I believed differently?  This post was a discussion to see if there was more that could be done to end this ridiculous mask situation.  You added absolutely nothing to that conversation.</p>

<p>You might not know this, but you can get the same bedroom set at any of a dozen furniture stores.  They all go to the same suppliers.  So the extra effort here was close to 0.</p>

        <p>Close to 0 but not 0....  also this was a question whether you should just put the mask on or find a different store. I responded with "vote with your wallet or shut up" (meaning - buy where they dont push agenda on you or else why bother posting).</p>
<p>The post expressed a dislike for this business practice, I merely said that it is their right just like you have the right to just go anywhere else.</p>

<p>Mandatory vaccination followed by what exactly? A vaccine passport? Why stop there?  Covid is by far one of the lesser diseases we have " vaccines" for, might as well make all those others mandatory as well. </p>
<p>What if someone refuses the mandatory vaccination? What will happen to them?  What happens if there's unforeseen consequences of the vaccine?</p>
