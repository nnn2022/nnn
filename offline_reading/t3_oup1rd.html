    <strong>COVID19 has created a Baby Crisis in the Foster Care System</strong>
    <p><p>My wife and I just got approved to be Foster Parents.</p>
<p>We were Rushed through the process as we are all set up to take a Baby  and an older sibling right away.</p>
<p>Learned through the Process how BAD the system has gotten due to COVID19.  </p>
<p>Here in Alberta Canada we have a BABY CRISIS.  To many babies in the system and not enough homes to take care of them.  Babies are being put in Group Homes as there is no other place for them.</p>
<p>What is not said out loud is WHY this has been happening...</p>
<p>IMO and from personal life experiences this is what happens when people are not able to leave their homes for an extended period of time.  People look for a little "release" and 9 months later Babies.</p>
<p>My brother was the result of a Blackout and I came out exactly 9 months to the day of my fathers birthday.  We saw the same happen in Eastern Canada after a Bad Blizzard/Ice Storm...had a little baby blip 9 months later.</p>
<p>This is all just part of the New Normal we are expected to accept.  </p>
<p>Children being tossed aside like garbage...  </p>
<p>At least my Government does not require the Vaccine to be a Foster Parent.  They need all the help they can get.</p></p>

        <p>They make it increasingly hard for anyone to take these children. Me and my husband have a house, lots of property, an 8yo (shared custody with my ex) and have applied and were discounted because we had a neighbour call into CFS about us (when the child was at her fathers ironically because the upstairs woman was running an illegal business and was seeing clients at all hours if you know what I mean) she called about yelling and screaming coming from our suite. My husband was on night shift at the time (proven to CFS with a pay stub) and text messages proving my child was at my exâ€™s and that I was the only one home, sleeping as I worked in 3 hours from the time she called. Now this little blip has put us out of the running to foster or adopt. Two people with no criminal records, steady work as income, a home, a yard and multiple hobbies but we still arenâ€™t good enough. Sometimes I wonder if they only give these poor children to the worst homes. Like they donâ€™t want them to have a chance. Iâ€™m in Manitoba, and if you
Look at our CFS record it would make you cry. Group homes are not a place to raise a child, let alone a baby. I am so sorry you are going through this, itâ€™s fucked when someone competent and willing to take a child is written off.</p>

        <p>We had a similar issue trying to adopt.</p>
<p>It was an BLM Activist who I got into a fight on Twitter with...she actually called our adoption agency to lie and get us dropped by them.  </p>
<p>We First went though an Agency and the Social Worker was very Cold and Unfriendly.  She was quite rude and discriminatory against me and my disability.  It was clear she did not like the answers she was given.  Even our family and friends who she contacted as references all said the same thing about her, she was very unfriendly and cold.  </p>
<p>It felt like the Agency did not want us.  We called them our for Discrimination and proved how the Social worker and the Director were twisting our words and lied right to our faces.  </p>
<p>The Government was far easier to work with.  Funny enough they were far more accepting and understanding.</p>

        <p>Those fucking cultists are disgusting. But then again, twitter is usually filled with cancerous people. I'm sorry you had to go through that with the agency.</p>

        <p>With a clear criminal record history as well as a clear animal and childrenâ€™s abuse registry being spot free it should be such an easy process with character witnesses as well as work references. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s a really sad process really, when you want to give an unwanted child a home. We wanted to foster and then hopefully adopt a child around my daughters age. For several reasons, one being children older than 3+ have a way harder time being adopted and as well as giving my daughter a sister she could love and adore that we could welcome into our family as one of our own. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s a really unfair system. If you want to PM me and talk more about this, I would love to know your story and see if I can help in any way!!</p>
