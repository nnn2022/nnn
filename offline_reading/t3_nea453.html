    <strong>I truly think the reason there is so much peer pressure to get the vaccine is because people are worried that you’ll be ok if there are life-long side effects</strong>
    <p><p>Just look at r/covidvaccinated. It is getting dangerously close to “misinformation” because so many people are expressing fear of a second dose due to the terrible experience they had with the first. People are starting to question if it’s worth it, but you’re only allowed to have doubts if you’ve had a shot. If you say you have doubts <em>before</em> getting a shot, everyone immediately starts talking like it’s the safest thing in the world. Want to know why? Because if you got an experimental treatment that did turn out to have life long side effects, wouldn’t you want as few people as possible to be healthy and free? Why do they get to enjoy happiness when I am going through hell for <em>”doing the right thing?”</em></p></p>
