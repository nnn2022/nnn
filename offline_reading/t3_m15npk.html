    <strong>The awful implication of states fully reopening...</strong>
    <p><p>Like falling dominoes, state after state is reopening to full and dropping the mask mandate. I can't tell you just how I glad I am to see this, as I'm sure many of you on this sub are as well.</p>
<p>But I wonder, are people prepared, or willing, to face and do something about what this implies?</p>
<p>-That the virus really wasn't that bad after all.-</p>
<p>How long have the authorities known this? </p>
<p>How was it so perfectly organized that nearly every country on the planet put people into de facto isolation for a virus not much worse than the flu, and often much less?</p>
<p>Will anyone be held accountable for the countless deaths -- not from covid, but the awful deaths of frightened, lonely people in hospitals where their own loved ones were barred from seeing them or hugging them one last time because the virus was supposedly so bad?  For all the suicides of despair?</p>
<p>As we go back out and mingle together, drink, dance, burn our masks and live our lives again, what will we do about the haunting and growing realization that it was all for nothing? Will our torturers even be held accountable?</p></p>

        <p>It’s not over. This is just one of the many steps towards technocracy, and TPTB that put in this place will not be going down without a massive fight. This is just the beginning of the tyranny, but I’m still holding out for the resistance. At any rate, two worlds are emerging, there is no returning to the pre-pandemic state, but we still have a choice for what we want moving forward.</p>

        <p>Depressingly...</p>
<p>Because of a fear of law suits, with covid still existing, pretty much all private transport companies; so buses, trains, taxis, etc; retail outlets, from supermarkets to clothing stores to fuel stations, and indoor sporting venues, will continue to enforce mask mandates out of a fear of an insurance claim.  The major ones anyway. </p>
<p>They won't care.  They know people will still use their services regardless.  </p>
<p>And they'll be right.</p>

        <p>&rt; They know people will still use their services regardless. And they'll be right.</p>
<p>I don't. I've never worn a mask and I shop exclusively at Aldi now because they don't have a mask bouncer. I can't get some foods I used to enjoy and the bacon and sometimes veg is of a lower quality but my principles come first. I can't stomach giving Tesco or Asda money ever again after how they treated me as a no-masker. I refuse to "play along" and even wear the lanyard either.</p>
<p>For sure the most infuriating thing has been the collusion between the big supermarkets, they all came out in the same week with the new tightened restrictions. They implemented the lanyard system and upgraded the mask bouncers from "recommendation" to not allowing you in the store + call the manager over to talk to you, ALL on the same day, with no change in government policy. The only way that happens is if they are colluding with one another so as to not lose customers.</p>

        <p>My state is reopening 100% and dropping the mask mandate starting tomorrow. The thousands of alt-leftists in my freedom loving state are flipping shit, acting like the Governor is trying to murder them with his bare hands. What’s funny, is most of these people weigh well over 300 lbs. and are as pale as milk. They can’t seem to make their own life decisions without the government doing it for them. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I’m happy to see some normalcy, though I’m pretty sure that most businesses are going to still keep these rules in place.</p>

        <p>My Dad was one of those people cowering at home, getting groceries delivered and double masking whenever he (rarely) went out.</p>
<p>During one phone conversation he was getting into the weeds of which masks, mask materials, designs and masking combinations he thought was best.  I jumped in and said "Dad, you can wear four masks and a face shield if you want, and maybe it will reduce your chance of getting infected, but one thing is certain.  If and when you DO get infected, the coronavirus will not know or care how many masks you've been wearing for how many months.  Your body will have to fight the virus on exactly the same terms as someone who's never touched a mask in his life.  When that happens, a healthy immune system is the ONLY thing that can help you, so don't neglect it in favor of masks."</p>

        <p>I think they'll have a couple of public hearings with designated fall guys like Cuomo.  A few quiet policy changes will be made, and a few lawsuits settled out of court.  </p>

        <p>I find it horrifying to be honest.</p>
<p>The fact the government decided to take away our civil and human rights for a generally non-dangerous disease and it faced no resistance from the people whatsoever at the start shows how easily manipulative we are as a civilization. </p>
<p>They only started to lift these mandates after they saw that a large percentage of the population doesn't believe them (referring to the anti-mask protests).</p>
<p>Not to mention that still quite a large number of people still believe the garbage they're being   fed.</p>
<p>The government is going to act like nothing happened even though they put these restrictions in the first place, and then they're gonna praise themselves for solving a problem that they created.</p>
<p>Let's be honest, they'll walk right out of this mess with no consequences and no resistance from the people who've just had their rights violated for a whole year. </p>
<p>Instead they're gong to make up another bullshit problem with a bullshit solution and another bullshit reason about why you should care while they retreat to the drawing board waiting for the next opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>And people are going to swallow it up again, and it'll be the talk of the town again, and then it will be replaced by another problem AGAIN in an endless circle of fucking bullshiterry that never mattered in the first place.</p>
<p>And it all works because the vast majority are the stupid to think for them selves, instead relying on politicians to make this choices for them.</p>
<p>Best of all ???</p>
<p>You have virtually no way of leaving this circle. You're stuck here.</p>
<p>Your family is stuck here.</p>
<p>Your children will be stuck here.</p>
<p>Until eventually, we go extinct.</p>

        <p>Most people in this sub already know that it was all for nothing.  It's the die hard lockdown proponents that will have to reconcile this for themselves.  I am sure the government will give themselves a pat on the back and mission accomplished banner to make people feel like this had any impact at all.</p>
<p>I spent the first year of this just being angry.  I felt the need to leave my home and a state I used to love.  I uprooted a world that was pretty perfect before this.  At this point though, I don't want to be angry, I just want to move on.</p>
<p>I agree with other point here too:</p>
<p>We still need to make villains out of this, all the states that are opening and dropping mandates are red, most gubernatorial elections are in 2022...</p>
<p>There will be things that are altered permanently.  Health passports to travel will be a thing.  I think in the US, it will be hard to implement these for other activities like work and concerts, as least vis a vis government intervention, but you might have businesses who dictate it.</p>
<p>Medical privacy seems pretty dead.  HIPAA is still a thing, but for some reason, we have decided to steamroll over it.  Your health status is somehow now everyone's business...</p>

        <p>They should be held accountable, and I've been saying all along that we can't just let them give us our freedom back since it was never theirs to take. We need to be the ones to take it back. I can't imagine a future where people still think like this. Where people think "Wow, remember that virus? It was so horrible, and the antimaskers just made it worse!" I just can't live in a world where people can't even realize the stupidity of this, even in the future. Because then society will just think we're the bad ones when we're the only ones that haven't lost our minds. We'll live in a world where we're at the mercy of our leaders because they'll feel they can do whatever they want. </p>
<p>They definitely need to be held accountable. It doesn't matter if they changed. What they did is done and it's still awful.</p>

        <p>I am sure reopening will be a disaster and fuel a push for mandatory vaccination and passports here in America as are already being implemented in other countries. See, here in America, we don't blaze new trails, we follow our global corporate masters. America. The land of followers, not leaders. The land of "no hurt feelings ever". Not the land of "no crying in baseball". Where weighing 600lbs is not only super healthy but also SEXY and if you don't think that, you are a misogynist.</p>

        <p>There will probably be a few scapegoats here and there to take the fall, like Cuomo, probably. Fauci retiring "to spend more time with his family" would not be surprising. If we're lucky, maybe some mild distancing from Bill Gates and his foundation . That's probably about it.</p>

        <p>All part of the dialectic process.  First, lockdown hard, remove all normalcy, take everything away.  Then reopen, but now with masks at every business, temp checks or covipass to get into a shop or travel, vaccines being coerced or mandated, especially by dangling the carrot of " freedom" if you comply.  </p>
<p>The technique is two steps forward, one step back.  Let's not allow ourselves to be tricked into misunderstanding what's happening here.  We haven't achieved anything, they haven't conceded anything.  There will be no accountability.  I'm sorry, for us all.</p>

        <p>oh as more states open more people will be waking up and asking themsevles " hey wait a minute...was the virus not as bad as the media and health experts were saying it is"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>" hey this virus was not bad enough to destroy our economy"</p>
<p>"if the virus was so deadly why were so many politicians and health experts caught not social distancing.masking and otherwise not following their own restrictions they had in place for the rest of us?"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>People hate to admit they are wrong..the especially hate to admit they were fooled. People are totally going to want some people to be held accountable. Here are my guesses as to whom.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fauci: This guy has flipped flopped on mask so many times and has even admitted to lying to the public. Also notice how he is freaking out now warning people of a dark turn if we open? He is aware he is fucked and the politicians will offer him up on a platter to us to appease our rage.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The media. People are going to be targeting them just as much. But I sadly think the media will just do a heel turn soon and report how lock downs were wrong. Trying to save face with the masses but I think the damage is done and people will be questioning the media more going forward.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Pandoras box has opened there's no way it can be closed. More states will be opening and more people will be questioning the whole virus narrative.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Government and media mistrust is going to be at an all time high for years to come. They played their hand and in doing so showed their true colors and it can't be undone.</p>

        <p>Call me crazy if it makes you feel better, but I'm a firm believer that the biggest driver behind last year's insanity was getting Trump out.</p>
<p>I know, this madness spread worldwide, but culture is the biggest export of the US and last year, fear was the culture.</p>
<p>I predict in 2023, around April or May, there will be a new lockdown ordered as variants or new viruses make their way to the forefront of culture again all in order to keep the bad Orange Man out of office.</p>

        <p>The lockdown/mask cultists own all the institutions that write the official histories, so I believe this will go down in history as a smashing success story of compassionate government triumphing over dangerous freedumbs, skeptic viewpoints will be gradually scrubbed from the record, and eventually skepticism will just be laughed off as something crazy racist old millennials in nursing homes rant about. </p>

        <p>I’m on the fence about this issue. I’ve been monitoring this sub lately. To me, the issue you all have is you don’t like this new normal. My question is, what exactly changed bedsides businesses closing earlier ? I’m in Pa and hardly anything has changed since the beginning of the pandemic. Masks  are a non issue. What exactly are you folks demanding for? You can already do everything that you could do before covid started.</p>

        <p>Aside from every event, even outdoor ones being canceled? Or some of our favorite places being closed permanently? Or perhaps, some of us with relatives in nursing homes we are unable to see? Everyone wears masks as a constant reminder that we're in the middle of a pAnDeMiC. </p>

        <p>Well, I'm not American so let me share what has happened here that I am so against.</p>
<p>The government has thrown democracy out of the window by enacting laws without any votes. For instance banning 1500 guns by name making millions of legal owners felons immediately. When asked about this overstep the comment was: "Canadians weren't voting in our favor so we bypassed the vote" this is one new normal I am opposed to.</p>
<p>People aren't allowed any gatherings of any sort, all churches have been closed (I don't go, but can still see how this is an issue) funerals aren't legal to attend, weddings aren't legal to attend. This is also apart of the new normal I am opposed to.</p>
<p>Currently we are in the process of phasing out cash under the guise of money being dirty and infested with these viruses. This may be true, but the reason for concern is the fact that this is a pretty obvious push to make all transactions traceable, no more helping family out or buying anything without a steep tax attached. You don't need to be a criminal to see how a cashless society hurts the average person and is best for government and control.</p>
<p>Small businesses are being crushed with these new restrictions(I know, I own one). They limit the amount of people allowed in stores as well as hours of operation to the point where everyone is having a hard time staying open. Wanna guess what companies are doing fine, or better than normal? Walmart, superstore, all the giant corporations. This new normal is in my mind a push to kill small business, and make it so the only people who can really own anything are the giant companies that already run our countries. Everyone who agrees with locksdowns in my mind is cheering for mega corporations to kill small businesses.</p>
<p>My 2 cents.</p>

        <p>Talking from a UK perspective here. No in person office work or schooling, no events and clubs running that make life interesting, most shops are shut and we can't go out and do anything, no opportunity to meet people, no domestic travel (understandable in this situation, but on the list nonetheless), people can't be with relatives in nursing homes or even on their death bed...you can't do anything at all. And even when you could do some of these things, there were so many restrictions on them that it was completely pointless anyway.</p>

        <p>Erm, whilst I hate it as much as you do, offices <em>are</em> open (I work in one) and <em>all</em>  schools opened earlier in the week, <em>all</em> supermarkets are open (but yeah a lot of other retail stores are closed); and buses, taxis and trains continue to run at diminished capacity</p>

        <p>I'm in Scotland. Offices aren't open, people are still working from home. Only some students are in school and I won't be back full time until mid April. Supermarkets are open with loads of restrictions and that's literally it, nothing else. No restaurants, no retail, nothing. I don't know how you can say this is almost normal.</p>

<p>Dude, we're in the third act of a fucking science fiction, planet-splitting dystopia under the guise of the sniffles, will a synchronous global response of tyranny.  Joy itself has been killed.  I really never said this was almost normal, just that shops and things were kinda still open.</p>

        <p>Oh okay, I misunderstood. I do wish I lived in England, it's just been confirmed for us high school students that the next three weeks aren't going to be normal school, and it will be after Easter that we go back properly (and even then with all the restrictions). Meanwhile England went back this week already.</p>
