<p>You are absolutely correct, unfortunately the masses are now allergic to 'good news' because this good news means they have to actually check their pride, and check their egos and admit that they were wrong. It will not happen trust me but stand strong and hold the line until the day you die. If it doesn't happen in our lifetime, it will happen in the future. You can not cage the truth as history shows again and again.</p>

        <p>Naaa. This is so unique. I am a respiratory therapist and I've seen a lot of covid. Hey now...I am anti mask and anti lockdown. I am against the reset, but, whatever is happening is too unique. I can't find a way your theory works. And I think the government is doing this. If it was just an expression of toxins, how could they know? Why would it be so fucking unique? How about all the corona virus research? They're all lying? I'm a skeptic looking for the truth.</p>

        <p>I really don't think so. Could be, but my reasoning says no. I mean it still could be exosomal expression transferred from one human to another, which might message others to detoxify, but I'm not buying that either. I'm seeing transmission of some illness. I mean, look at Fauci and his research into corona viruses. I just can't negate that. I 100% believe this was orchestrated and planned and I'm not sure you could do that with a.detoxifyimg theory. Not that that isn't some illness is expressed, but I think this is a man-made virus and it was purposefully released and this is just the beginning. The virus is going to mutate due to viral escape in my opinion. I believe I am already starting to see it. We are having a major uptick here in MN.</p>

        <p>My theory is, people a generally not very healthy.  Our bodies are being constantly assaulted with nutrient deficient food (fast food), radiation (EMF), vaccines (aluminium adjuvants), heavy metals, alcohol, smoking, lack of sunlight (from being locked down + seasonal effects), lack of clean air and other environmental factors.</p>
<p>Also, do not forget the power the mind has over the body.  When in a state of stress the body can become sick.  Do you think people are stressed at the moment with all the fear propogated by the MSM?  Interestingly enough in Chinese Holistic Medicine the lungs are associated with sadness or grief.</p>
