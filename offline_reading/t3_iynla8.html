        <p>A popular theory is that the upcoming vaccine will cause sterility in most or even all the people who take it, thus furthering his depopulation agenda. Of course, this will likely be blamed on the virus or some other thing they cook up or they will shrug and go "Oopsie, but at least you're still alive!"</p>

        <p>Overpopulation is a myth used to cover up the failures of central planning. They act like the only way to house everyone would be for everyone to live in tiny 600 square foot apartment, but just look at a zoning map for a city like Vancouver, BC... it's 85% single family detached homes, 10% townhouses, and 5% apartments. That is not what would happen in a free society with organic zoning produced through an iterative commonlaw process of contract negotiation and tort cases.</p>
<p>Until everyone realizes we're all still living in a largely centrally planned world, nothing will improve in regards to the systemic issues plaguing us.</p>
<p>Of course somone like Gates wouldn't even begin to think along these lines, he's already fully invested in the idea that he is a God and society is a piece of software for him to engineer and tinker with. Social engineering, so trendy.</p>

        <p>The smoking gun that media has morphed into a primitive propaganda machine is that they ceaselessly interview this guy. Not an MD, not a health professional, just a rich guy who donates loads of money to places like PBS Newshour and buys influence. It's a sorry reflection on what it takes to have your voice heard in America. He turned the internet into a pay to play and now he wants to use that model on freedom. It's despicable.</p>

<p>Third off the 200k number is the official death toll and even though it may include people that may not have died of covid it also doesn’t include everyone that has died of covid. The unofficial death toll is much higher. According to the NYT, US covid deaths surpassed 200k in early August </p>

        <p>Wow I can’t believe I have actually run into someone as dumb as you never thought it would happen. How is it possible that someone who DIED OF COVID BECAUSE THEY HAD ASTHMA DID NOT DID OF COVID. You are trying to tell me that they died of asthma. I didn’t know dying of asthma was a thing anymore but I guess if you don’t get vaccinated or go to a doctor to get prescribed medicine like an inhaler for asthma then I guess you could die of asthma. You posted a picture of some books? All of which were negative on vaccines. Not a single one said how vaccines work. You again have echo chambered yourself. Why are leftist news organizations that are highly acknowledged as being relevant and accuracy information not accurate? I could say the same for any of your sources and all of your books? You haven’t been able to make a coherent point yet. I watch fox and cnn and Ben Shapiro and npr. It’s called seeing the full picture.

<p>Can you read? 
Here is the headline: </p>
<p><strong>"Your Coronavirus Test Is Positive. Maybe It Shouldn’t Be"</strong> </p>
<p>So you cant be certain of Covid as the cause of death, if the tests generate FALSE positives. As Dr Birx stated - Covid is used whenever they suspect Covid. No talk of co-morbidities. </p>

<p>Ignoring the rest of this insane drivel. </p>
<p>&rt;You posted a picture of some books? All of which were negative on vaccines.</p>
<p>Because we are flooded DAILY with information claiming vaccines are panaceas to all our ills. Not a single new site, or publications talks of the ills of vaccines. If every major news organization is reporting positives - wouldnt you seek out negatives to balance it out ?</p>
<p>&rt; Also you roast leftist sites and then post another leftist site??? Huh? </p>
<p>Its called short circuiting your stupid argument. As I stated above <strong>I posted a left wing organization because I am certain its the only source you wouldnt discredit</strong></p>

        <p>First off, I don't have an NYT account therefore I cannot read the article. Thank you though.</p>
<p>You are assuming that a high percentage of the people that died of COVID didn't die of COVID. That is what you are insinuating. Here's a dumbed-down article for you from a different source that might help you to understand:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02497-w">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02497-w</a></p>
<p>Why did you ignore part of my response? I just said the same thing you did in your previous reply? Also just like you are saying the information on the internet can be wrong, so can the information in books. Also, you really think I'm a leftist? I'm tryna be a billionaire not give my money away to some poor fucks.</p>
<p>Also you now attacking my person in your other reply? Really had to resort to that instead of just acknowledging the words I wrote. A good tactic to dodge points well done.</p>
<p>I don't have a bookshelf. Books don't make you intelligent unless the content of the books in intelligent. I have yet to see a book that contains knowledge like this. Every thought you have had about vaccines have come from books with no correct information. Do you think that's a problem?</p>
<p>Have you never had a vaccine or did you get autism from your first vaccine?</p>
<p>But seriously chill with calling me a leftist that not cool.</p>

        <p>Well, at least I graduated, unlike your high school dropout ass. I don't watch tv so that in invalid point. I don't even have cable? So again not a valid point. But again why are your books correct but everything else is wrong? I hope you have vaccinated your 7-year-old else if he dies of a disease that could be prevented.. you can be charged with child negligence so be careful... <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5308147/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5308147/</a></p>
<p>Why do you think vaccines exist and have you ever gotten a vaccine? I really would like an honest answer to that question from you.  Also I probably pay your salary in taxes haha</p>

<p>blah blah blah. I have got lawyers for that. And a 2nd and 4th amendment in our constitution for dealing with overreach. </p>
<p>If you could read, you would know about the  </p>
<ul>
<li>National Vaccine Act </li>
<li>VAERS/VICP and the fact its awarded over 4.3+ billion for adverse reactions from less than 1% reporting </li>
<li><strong>Every state offers exemptions from vaccines (for attending school) to parents on medical/personal/religious grounds</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway enough of this, its been fun. I am actually wasting time with someone who hasnt read a single book <strong>for</strong> or <strong>against</strong>  this subject. </p>

        <p>Wow i feel extremlel bad for you 7-year-old. His 42 year old boomer dad goes on reddit and comments on r/EngorgedVeinyBreasts r/HairyPussy and r/HappyEmbarassedGirls. Feels bad. Cant belive 7000 people are in this subreddit. I was really hoping you would give me some facts about vaccines but apparently you never actually read those books. Wouldn't answer me about being vaccinated or why you thought it was bad. Something doesn't add up here? Oh maybe its that this man above me is beyond stupid. His IQ is most likely lower than the average of Africa.</p>

        <p>First off, your last sentence is not proper English so clearly you don’t know English either. 
Also I replied to your comment that talked about bill gates wanting to make money off of vaccines??? Did you ignore that part? 
You clearly don’t know anything about virology or vaccines because having to get multiple shots is healthy and necessarily in some scenarios, here’s some info: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-understand-color-office.pdf</p>

<p>the CDC is a corrupt organization:  Their thoughts on this subject mean NOTHING to me </p>
<p>https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2019/07/17/why-health-commissioners-end-up-with-big-pharma.aspx?v=1598274200  </p>
<p>https://healthimpactnews.com/2018/cdc-director-resigns-showing-conflict-of-interest-and-big-pharma-influence-still-reigns-at-the-cdc/</p>
<p>Julie Gerberding, the doctor who led the CDC from 2002 to 2009 (the time period when the Food and Drug Administration approved Gardasil without proper safety testing), <strong>left CDC to become president of Merck Vaccines</strong> and subsequently became Merck’s executive vice president for global strategic communications.</p>
<p>Media outlets are announcing the abrupt resignation of Brenda Fitzgerald, the physician appointed in July, 2017 to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </p>
<p>The resignation follows on the heels of reporting by Politico, <strong>which uncovered conflicts of interest pertaining to dubious investment decisions made by Fitzgerald after she became the nation’s top public health official—including the purchase of thousands of dollars of tobacco, pharmaceutical and health care stocks</strong>  </p>
<p>Thats TWO HEADS of the CDC who resigned on conflicts of interest - one left to work at Merck the very pharmaceutical giants they are supposed to watch over. Thats like LA cops resigning to join the Latin Kings .</p>
<p>Finally you claimed earlier that I got my info from social media. I responded with a picture of the books in my bookshelf - including three written by Medical Doctors.  I asked you to post a picture of the books in your bookshelf to prove YOU ARENT getting your info from social media  ...</p>
<p>I am still waiting </p>
<p>What you did was called "projection" and the longer you hold out of showing the books that inform your opinion the more you prove that it is YOU who are reliant on social media for your info and analysis</p>

        <p>Just because you own books doesn't mean anything. They were all books that coincided with your beliefs. This is called confirmation Bias. This is what I have been talking about the entire time with the Echo Chamber stuff. All those books supported your beliefs which again is something called Confirmation Bias if you have heard of that.

<p>Says the man who cant read. I fully expect an illiterate, uneducated man-child to say that and you did. 
My bookshelf is full of books on many subjects of interest to me. Its called INTELLECTUAL CURIOUSITY</p>
<p>&rt;They were all books that coincided with your beliefs. </p>
<p>So I assume your bookshelf would have books confirming your belief that vaccines are safe. Lets see those books </p>
<p>Because if you DONT have ANY books on the subject (positive or negative) it means EVERYTHING you know about vaccines and EVERY thought in your head was put there from television and social media .</p>
