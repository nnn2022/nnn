    <strong>Restaurants</strong>
    <p><p>"Gotta wear a mask in the door! Step, step step, sit SAFE!" The virus doesn't attack when you're seated eating!" </p>
<p>I was at a restaurant the other day and half the tables were closed off, but all the booths were open, so my head was four inches from the head of the person in the next booth over. Totally safe I'm sure! That's when you know it's all bullshit.</p>
<p>It's just like 911. Right after 911 if you had said airport security is just security theater you would have been lynched. Almost 20 years on and most people agree, TSA is just a clown show. This is no different, people are scared, so they make up a bunch of protocol bullshit to make them feel safe. The masks do next to nothing. Get the vaccine or don't,  or hide in your basement forever, or just resume your life, I say don't live in fear, life is too short for this bullshit!</p></p>
