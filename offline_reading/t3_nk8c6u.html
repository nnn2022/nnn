    <strong>The Modern Medical Industry Must Be Completely Remade</strong>
    <p><p><strong>ONG POST. TL;DR: Modern doctors see themselves as New-Age Gods that control life and death and resent you for not submitting to the technocratic medical elite. They are cultish ideologues without compassion who are in the industry for the money and most of them cannot replicate their own or anyone else's medical "research". The American Medical Industry is a disaster, all countries should disregard it and all of its "findings" for the safety of their citizens.</strong></p>
<p>The medical industry, as it exists today, is a Godless abomination that must be institutionally reimagined and rebuilt if we are to survive as a civilization.</p>
<p>Do me a favor. Open a new tab and search "Medical School Cheating" on Reddit. Click the result from the "Medicine" sub. (censored for AutoMod). Click on it and read the comments. This article is about medical students cheating on their medical exams. Look at the comments. Don't say anything, don't leave you own comment (No point. Mods over there insta ban people that question MuH ScIEnCE on sight.) Just look.</p>
<p>Look at how these fucking people talk about you. Look and get a rare glimpse into the mind and attitude of modern American "doctors". <strong>FUN FACT:</strong> Medical Malpractice is the 3rd leading cause of death in America. They cheat their way through school, and even if they don't, they only know "medicine" in so far as they know which horrific concoction the crooked witch doctors at Big Pharma have created to prescribe that suppresses symptoms but hardly ever treats the cause.</p>
<p><strong>European Redditors:</strong> Are you taking USA refugees? Ich spreche Deutsch und liebe Deutschland und Europa. Bitte hilfe. Bin Baby.</p>
<p>Most modern doctors resent the masses, they resent middle America, they resent people that don't submit to their medical tyranny, and they resent you for being free. They hate every unfortunate soul you've seen that suffers with obesity or unhealthy habits. They are secretly disgusted with them, and hate them for not being healthier. Instead of things like education, lifestyle changes, compassion, nutrition, etc, they simply give the worst off of us medicine to suppress the symptoms until they wither away and die. In their minds, the uneducated mass that doesn't understand why his lifestyle is killing him and just needs a push to get disciplined deserves his ill health. Medicine for profit run by sociopaths that haven't the compassion nor skills to be in their industry. Read their subreddits. Look at how they think about you!</p>
<p>Same thing with mental health. Oh, you're having this mental reaction to living in an intensely isolating and materialistic degenerate society? You have this disorder and that disorder. Clearly youaren't normal and must be indefinitely sedated so you go back to sleep. Stop noticing things! Here, take this mind altering addictive medication for the rest of your life. Will it cause brain damage? Chemical dependency? Don't ask such things! The science was settled by "independent" think tanks and research organizations that receive their funding from the same Big Pharma giants that make the pills. Why are you a science denier!? BIGOT! <strong>FUN FACT #2: The Replication crises!</strong> Did you know that 70% of "MuH ScIeNCe" Modern Doctors in a <em>Nature</em> survey reported to have tried and failed to reproduce a medical experiment, and that over half are incapable of reproducing their own experiments? ( <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a">1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility | Nature</a> ) <strong>FUN FACT NUMBER #3</strong> In a 2012 study by C. Glenn Begley, only 11% of pre-clinical cancer studies can be replicated. ( <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Drug-development%3A-Raise-standards-for-preclinical-Begley-Ellis/1a81d3d1e8a983e0551edf485f4ac1a8cdd7fea4">[PDF] Drug development: Raise standards for preclinical cancer research | Semantic Scholar</a> ) GEE GOLLY Its almost like they're a bunch of New Age religious ideologues that are only in it for the money!</p>
<p>I had a doctor tell my mother to her face that he doesn't understand why she wants to get her blood sugar under control such that she doesn't need medication anymore. She takes an extremely light dose of what she has, her blood sugar is excellent, and for many years she didn't need to take medicine at all. She said she wants to get back to that point and the quack doctor got mad! "Why would you want to do that? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Why the hell would you put yourself through that? What's wrong with the medicine?"</p>
<p>That encounter should tell you more than anything else. These people hate that you are free. They hate that the unwashed uneducated mass that they've so long written off and condemned to suffer are waking up and realizing the truth of health, and how the "medical industry" is nothing but a multi trillion dollar life support machine that keeps people dumb and addicted. That doctors violent reaction is because my mother doesn't need him anymore. That was her last appointment (Find and internist doctor if you can folks.)</p>
<p>He's angry because he has got it in his head that he is the new elite. He's a doctor! A technocratic oligarch. A blessed anointed one. With the power of medicine he wields life and death in his hands like a knight wields his sword. He holds your life in his hands! Why aren't you listening? Why don't you submit!? Science denier! Bigot! Redneck! Don't you know who I am? I am the one who commands mortality! I am the enlightened one! Come back! SUPER SPREADER! COVIDIOT! <strong>I AM GOD.</strong></p>
<p>Until these people face real consequences in a court of law nothing will change. Until this industry is institutionally dismantled nothing will change. Until we certify, as a matter of law, that they are responsible for the deaths caused by their quackery nothing will change. Neither changing to a single payer system nor eliminating government red tape will cure this moral abomination. This is a matter of law, a matter of justice.</p>
<p>The ride never stops!</p></p>

        <p>Without saying too much I 100% agree. I see patients come back with issues because the doctors botched their surgeries. On top of that my dad is on every pill imaginable because he thinks they help him and is too scared to ask his doctor how he can get off all the medication. Doctors don't even help him because they have a life long customer.</p>

        <p>I have been chronically ill since my late 20s and now in my early 50s. I don't trust doctors. Sure some helped me and even saved my life, but there's a lot of stuff I had to push to get diagnosed to save my life. I have had crazy ones on rare occasion that wanted to do experiments or put me on black box drugs etc. I have refused some procedures. The least invasive the better, is my general outlook. This Covid stuff has me freaked out because of people's utter trust in the medical profession. A lot of the population must have never been sick because otherwise this makes no sense to me.  I don't trust them. Things go wrong. Sometimes you do end up with the C and D student doctors who don't know what they are doing. The ones I have now seem to know the basics, but I've seen the other kind too.  I think they drum out all the caring people out of medical school and you get a parade of narcissists and sociopaths because of the make the residents work until they drop with no sleep crap. So you get the hardened, the cheaters and the burnouts who don't give a damn. Many are arrogant. Doctors can be scary people having so much power over you. I have noticed they train them to have no emotions but it has crossed a point where before it was to be in control and professional that's gotten so out of hand, they are turning them cold towards no hearts. I agree with the commenter that says medical school is a hazing experience. They drum out the kind ones and the independent minded ones.</p>

        <p>Medical school is set up to be like a hazing experience. It brainwashes the doctors into thinking they didn’t go through all that for nothing and they must have exclusive knowledge now. All by design thanks to the Rockefellers. The admissions process also self selects for lying, cheating narcissists.</p>

        <p>Yeah .. i don`t know how this could be fixed. You are right, but jail is  not the solution as it`s a process easy to corrupt, and they will keep doing what they do.If we talk about punishment, id go for public executions, eye for an eye, and nothing less. I think that .. before taking on doctors .. we should eliminate most of the causes that make us need a doctor, leaving just those that can`t be avoided.By doing this , number of patients will drop, and bad doctors will end up with no one left to treat. But this is .. impossible.</p>

        <p>If you know a cursory amount of information about something medical, you know more than your doctor. Then you can embarass him, so he won't give you your meds.</p>

        <p>Jeez some of the comments are disgusting and dehumanizing. They seem trained to see life as nothing but statistics and numbers. I actually wanted to go to medical school in my teens but I ended up having to take a gap year- in which I ended up reading a lot about the health industry and came to my own conclusion to not touch it with a 10 ft pole. I probably wouldn't be able to live with myself if I'd gone that way.</p>
