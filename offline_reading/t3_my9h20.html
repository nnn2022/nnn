    <strong>UPDATE: The Most Important MMR-Autism Study Ever Done - Age at First Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccination in Children With Autism and School-Matched Control Subjects: A Population-Based Study in Metropolitan Atlanta</strong>
    <p><p>UPDATE: to summarize the situation thus far. </p>
<p>in 2004, the CDC did a vaccine-autism study where they claimed they were unable to find a link between vaccines and autism. </p>
<p>in 2014, one of the co-authors of the CDC study made a press release, admitting to omitting the data that linked vaccines to autism. His name is Dr William Thompson, and he is now better known as the CDC whistleblower</p>
<p>in 2014, in response to the CDC whistleblower, the CDC issued an official statement, where they made three important claims. </p>
<p>1) "The study looked at different age groups: children vaccinated by 18 months, 24 months, and 36 months. The findings revealed that vaccination between 24 and 36 months was slightly more common among children with autism, and that association was strongest among children 3-5 years of age. <strong>The authors reported this finding was most likely a result of</strong> immunization requirements for preschool special education program attendance in children with autism."</p>
<p>2) "Additional studies and a more recent rigorous review by the Institute of Medicine have found that MMR vaccine does not increase the risk of autism."</p>
<p>3) the data set is available for public scrutiny. </p>
<p>the data set is 404 --&rt; https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/developmentaldisabilities/maddsp-data-sets.html</p>
<p>claim 1) (autism causes vaccines) </p>
<p>this was merely someones baseless opinion, which was never supported by any data whatsoever, and was an easy "fact" for vaccine critics to target and exploit. </p>
<p>claim 2) (Additional studies and a more recent rigorous review have found that MMR vaccine does not increase the risk of autism.) </p>
<p>this sounded a bit more credible, but there have emerged three major problems with the claim.</p>
<p>A) They cited these supposed "Additional studies and a more recent rigorous review" by IoM, but never actually linked to any source, and after challenging many vaccine proponents to produce these supposed studies and reviews,... </p>
<p>we finally have them! ... and they were published in a book... in 2012</p>
<p><em>Adverse Effects of Vaccines - Evidence and Causality (2012)</em></p>
<p>https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13164/adverse-effects-of-vaccines-evidence-and-causality</p>
<p>B) Because we already know that the CDC study fraudulently omitted data that linked vaccines to autism, it seems highly implausible that the CDCs fraudulent study could be replicated with any honest study. </p>
<p>C) Given the fact that the IoM published their findings in 2012, the IoM was probably not aware of the CDC fraud that was not disclosed until 2014, and were therefore unable to address it.</p>
<p>D) the purpose of "a more recent rigorous review" is to find fraud or other problems. if the CDC's fraudulent study was "reviewed" properly, how was this fraud missed? if they can miss the CDC fraud during a "rigorous" review, what else do they miss?</p>
<p>3) They continue to deliberately and dishonestly conflate </p>
<p>"our <em>studies can't find</em> the evidence" </p>
<p>with </p>
<p>"our <em>studies found that</em>...</p>

<p>2014, CDC whistleblower press release:</p>
<p>"...i regret my coauthors and i omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in journal Pediatrics. the omitted data suggested AA males who received MMR vaccine before age 36 mo were at increased risk for autism..."</p>

<p>2014, CDC statement on CDC whistleblower:</p>
<p>The study looked at different age groups: children vaccinated by 18 months, 24 months, and 36 months. The findings revealed that vaccination between 24 and 36 months was slightly more common among children with autism, and that association was strongest among children 3-5 years of age.

<p>unfortunately, the CDC does not have any data to support their theory about autism causing vaccines.</p>
<p>fortunately, the CDC whistleblower admitted that theres a link between vaccines and autism.</p>
<p>fortunately, the CDC rebuttal to the CDC whistleblower was not to deny a link between vaccines and autism,
but to acknowledge the link between vaccines and autism,</p>
<p>and then to offer some baseless theory about autism programs causing early vaccines,
as opposed to early vaccines causing autism programs.</p>
<p>just to be clear, in 2004 the CDC did a study specifically to see if vaccines cause autism,</p>
<p>and when their own data showed them what they did not want to see, the CDC simply omitted those data from their study,</p>
<p>and then proceeded to publish a study conclusion that was the exact opposite of what their own (omitted) data showed them!</p>
<p>in 2014, the CDC whistleblower, Dr William Thompson, made a press release admitting to omitting the data from their study.</p>
<p>in 2014, as a response to the CDC whistleblower allegations, the CDC made a statement where they come up with a brand-new theory about the data that showed a link between autism and vaccines.</p>
<p>the new theory was that link was because of vaccination requirements for autism programs.</p>
<p>so the timeline alone is very incriminating. 2004-2014-2014</p>
<p>the CDC didn't bother to try and explain the link between vaccines and autism until after the CDC whistleblower made his press release admitting that the CDC omitted the data showing the link between vaccines and autism.</p>

        <p>Do you not know why Andrew Wakefield (the guy who made Vaxxed) lost his job? He intentionally lied in his study published in The Lancet that claimed the MMR vaccine caused autism. HE LIED and lost his medical license for it.</p>
<p>Why would you want to trust anything he says??? He is a scam!</p>

        <p>yeah it seems a bit strange that all of wakefield's co-conspirators all got off scot-free, after they were each intimidated into taking their name off the study. wakefield wouldn't back down, and thats why they railroaded him. </p>
<p>brain deer, a so-called journalist, took 12 years to dissect the wakefield paper, </p>
<p>and why was he fixated on this one study, and who was paying his bills wile we went down a 12 year rabbit hole?</p>
<p>supposedly brian deer tracked down most of the kids in the study, and interviewed their parents, and their parents all claim that wakefield took liberties with the facts, </p>
<p>but we aren't allowed to know who these parents are, to verify with them, that brian deer did actually interview them. for all we know, brian deer just made his entire narrative up.</p>

        <p>Why are all of your sources from conspiracy sites, which are biased against vaccines?</p>
<p>There is no autism epidemic. The only reason autism has "more cases" is because the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) made it much easier to diagnose. For example, they say that "not wanting to do school work" is a sign of autism, however that can be said about literally any student.</p>
<p>There isn't more autism, there is just more being falsely detected as autism.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why are all of your sources from conspiracy sites, </p>
<p>pseudoscience: dismisses criticism as conspiracy theory. </p>
<p>&rt;which are biased against vaccines?</p>
<p>why are sources that are biased in favor of vaccines considered credible ?</p>
<p>&rt;There is no autism epidemic. </p>
<p>1 in 68 kids is now on the spectrum. </p>
<p>&rt;The only reason autism has "more cases" is because the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) made it much easier to diagnose. For example, they say that "not wanting to do school work" is a sign of autism, however that can be said about literally any student.</p>
<p>interesting theory. </p>
<p>you should be able to back that up with some data over time, like showing an inflection point when the DSM-5 came out.</p>
<p>but unfortunately, you can't show that with data, because thats not what happened.</p>
<p>no. they have been claiming for 40 years that they have better tools, better training, better diagnostics...</p>
<p>and what do they have ? a new edition of DSM? </p>
<p>is that why the cases of "mental retardation" is declining at a rate that is inversely proportional to the increase in diagnostics of ASD ?</p>
<p>what made "mental retardation" go away? nobody seems to be taking credit for this "miracle of science"? </p>
<p>&rt;There isn't more autism, there is just more being falsely detected as autism.</p>
<p>thats demonstrably false. </p>
<p>for example, there was a school board meeting in california, where they brought in experts such as accountants etc and they could show, over time that there is, and has been, an actual, measurable need for increased "special education" spending year over year over year</p>

        <p>Imagine thinking that 1/36 children having autism is completely normal. Imagine believing in evolution/survival of the fittest and having beliefs that weaker genes die off, the strong survive yet so many kids you see are autistic or on ADD meds, also imagine believe in God and thinking he would make it so common for us to be autistic or whatever what a joke.</p>

<p>&rt;Imagine believing in evolution/survival of the fittest and having beliefs that weaker genes die off</p>
<p>Well that only applies to wild species that struggle to survive and reproduce. It's not hard at all for a human to reproduce.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from my psychology textbook on what they think is the cause of the "autism epidemic":</p>
<p>&rt;Rates of ASD continue to increase, but the reasons for this change remain a source of debate in the scientific community. It is possible that the rates are truly increasing, but greater awareness by parents and health care providers, relaxed applications of the diagnostic criteria, and improved availability of services might also be contributing to the observed change.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the rates have never been increasing, they only appear to be increasing because of increased awareness and concern. Autism Speaks (although they barely represent autism accurately) was founded in 2005, around the time when autism numbers began to increase. Also, the Lancet MMR autism debacle happened in 1998, also around the time when autism numbers began to increase.</p>

        <p>You can't be serious you believe that we are just more aware of it now come be realistic. Autism should not be remotely this common its bizarre to think we are just more aware it now I know you don't think it's normal for it to be this common, I'm not saying it's just vaccines it's also all the shit in our foods and such.

        <p>Our brain still functioned before psychologists discovered how it did, does that mean our brains developed as new functions of it were being discovered? No, it's always been about awareness. Especially for mental health issues, in the 20th century you would expect to be sent to an asylum for the rest of your life but that has completely changed today. Diagnosing a mental illness is a better thing in today's world than in the 20th century because there are more options available to treat it.</p>
<p>There very well could be something in our food increasing rates of autism, but I think it is foolish to not include the fact that the way society handles mental diseases has completely changed over the past three decades. The increase in autism has many factors and they all need to be considered if society wants to reduce it.</p>

        <p>What does our brain functioning before psychologists knew how it worked relate to anything. Are you implying autism is not an irregularity. And just because they delt with mental illness in that way does not mean it's not an irregularity. If they find a better way to deal with mental illness that doesn't imply that they have found the root cause. Just a better treatment. Nothing could ever make me believe that autism rates and mental illness this high is an normal thing for humans thats beyond bizarre.</p>

<p>then they tried to explain it away. </p>
<p>100 more "studies" are never going to convince anyone that the CDC didn't commit fraud to coverup the fact that vaccines cause autism</p>

        <p>I give up trying to convince you, we are going in circles. It is clear that you will continue to think vaccines cause autism despite what I tell you, and I will continue to think vaccines do not cause autism despite what you tell me.</p>

        <p>heres a 2 minute video of a mother explaining what happened after she vaccinated her son.</p>
<p>please give me some good reasons to doubt her story.</p>
<p>"studies" that <em>can't seem to find the evidence</em>, are not good reasons...</p>

        <p>Autism as a whole needs more research, as to how its developed, what causes it, or if its just a “different” type of brain function and not caused by something. </p>
<p>And obviously deff need more vaccine safety research</p>

        <p>so, on the one hand we have pro-vaccine parents who vaccinated their kids, and their kids suffered a vaccine injury, which made the parents more skeptical of vaccine safety claims...</p>
<p>and on the other hand, we have 100 "studies" that claim they "can't find the evidence", which really ins't surprising, since no vaccine study in the history of the world has ever found that any vaccine has ever caused any long term problem. </p>
<p>the J&amp;J blood clot thing wasn't found with a study, it was found in the ER.</p>

        <p>i suspect its just a cover story. </p>
<p>they jump on this blood clot thing. bring everyones attention to it, to give us the impression that they are really keeping a close eye on adverse reactions...</p>
<p>then they come out and say, oh, no big deal, its just 1 in a million chance. </p>
<p>carry on...</p>
<p>in the meantime, they completely ignore all of the <em>other</em> vaccine problems that are much more common</p>

<p>if vaccines <em>didn't</em> cause autism, then why did <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754936">the CDC do a vaccine-autism study</a>, and then deliberately <a href="https://i.redd.it/1rb482xb9ty41.png">omit the statistically significant data that linked vaccines to autism</a>, and then when they got caught, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Autism/cdc2004pediatrics.html">the CDC claimed the reason vaccines are linked to autism, is because autism causes vaccines</a></p>
<p>idk, it sure looks to me like the CDC knows that vaccines cause autism, but decided to lie about it, probably because the CDC was concerned that if parents knew the truth, they wouldn't <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html">vaccinate as much as the vaccine quacks want them to</a></p>
