    <strong>What is the TRUE split of vaxxed/unvaxxed/on the fence?</strong>
    <p><p>We constantly hear the media tell us - “90% want to be vaccinated… 70% are vaccinated… 50% of business owners want the option to only serve vaccinated customers”. Etc etc</p>
<p>Now I know most these numbers come from silly biased surveys then the news announce it like it’s consensus. It’s purpose is to make the person who is on the fence, sitting alone at home, to feel like an outcast and join their group. </p>
<p>Would this be an accurate split?</p>
<p>-25% vaccinate. Very fixated on EVERYBODY being vaxxed. Prom mandatory vax and segregation. </p>
<p>-25% vaxxed BUT not in favour of any segregation… they are confident that vax protects them from any serious complications and they don’t feel endangered by others. </p>
<p>-25% on the fence re vaxx, probably not in favour of segregation. This is the key group the media wants to swing.</p>
<p>-25% don’t want the vaxx because we’re not at risk and it doesn’t affect transmission to others.</p>
<p>I don’t think mandatory vax/exclusion passports will ever work because too many people see how problematic it is…. But if the ‘on the fence’ category are swayed it might take their number to over 50%…. Surely the majority 60% won’t want to exclude 40%</p></p>

        <p>I am coming at this from a UK perspective.</p>
<p>Based on just anecdotal evidence alone from what I can gather from friends and family I would say that is probably a reasonable split. </p>
<p>From my experience, most will genuinely take every vaccination offered to them (say seventy five percent) but within that there will be a broad church of 'everyone must have the vaccine' to 'I am just having the vaccine because I want to go to Spain and get pissed'.</p>
<p>The remaining twenty-five percent is again a broad church, a very slim minority genuinely hardcore into facebook Bill Gates / lizard man nonsense. The rest ranging from hardcore conservatives who are against it purely as forced/mandated vaccination goes against their basic principles, some as they are yet to be convinced of the safety of the vaccine versus the severity of COVID, and a small but significant proportion of people who are just too lazy or unable to get the vaccine for other reasons.</p>
<p>I am VERY sceptical of the UK government numbers on vaccinations (I believe they may be a little overstated although it is clear that by and large the majority of the population is now vaccinated either fully or partially). But I am even more sceptical of these opinion polls.</p>
<p>Coindicentally, the UK Minister fo Vaccines (Mr Zahawi) I believe founded the large British market data and analytics firm 'YouGov' which is regularly cited on MSM for these sorts of things. <br>
[Proof of Mr Zahawi's involvement: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/161121/zahawi_nadhim.htm]</p>
<p>As a consquence of the vote to leave the EU, I largely don't see these polls as a good barometer of public opinion. When I see this:  </p>

<p>I don't pay it too much heed.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the comment.</p>
<p>Good point about the people who take the vaxx because they just want to go to Spain. </p>
<p>At first these people wouldn’t be in favour of mandatory vax… but after being continaully told “you can’t party because the others aren’t vaxxed, the only way you can party is if COVID passports are mandated” then they will jump onto that side</p>

        <p>I think everyone except a very very small few of the most stubborn people will go without this vaccine </p>
<p>A soon as they enforce vaccine passports</p>
<p>Then everyone will bow</p>
<p>How many people can sustain themselves ? </p>
<p>2 % ?</p>
