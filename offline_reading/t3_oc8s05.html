        <p>You’re correct, at least philosophically. But you’ll be happy to know that’s how science already functions. It is known as “disconfirmation” or “falsification”, and it’s a derivation of the “modus tollens” deductive structure that assumes the rejection of a hypothesis.</p>

<p>I studied philosophy as part of my undergraduate career, and I took this course called “Ways of Knowing”, taught by Dr. Jennifer Mundale, and one of the simplest things she said that stuck with me was, “To the extent that a given hypothesis cannot be falsified, it is a bad one.”</p>

        <p>That sounds like scientism to me. Non-falsifiable hypotheses may still be correct. They probably won't ever be <em>scientific</em> hypotheses, but that doesn't mean they aren't useful.</p>

        <p>Profit-driven anything sucks I think, but I'm not sure how much motivation people would have to fulfill certain occupations without the allure of money. It seems like products should be made to last and made to be easily repaired, but there's less money in that. There's also more money in convincing idiots they need a new version of something they already have. Aside from this a profit-driven education system is also a disaster. I would support the government paying for education as long as things were made as efficient and useful as possible. It seems like doing an internship or working with an expert would be the best training for most jobs, not a decade of school taking a bunch of irrelevant classes and memorizing a bunch of stuff you're going to forget.</p>

        <p>I think it’s on purpose, people say history repeats itself, I think that’s not human nature, I think it’s our overlords know how to keep history repeating the same cycle, they know the techniques that work and keep using them over and over again- I also think they keep repeating revelations from the bible because they wrote the bible and they just keep making it happen again and again, revelations has happened like a hundred times already lol
It’s just theatre they enjoy and we are the unwitting stage cast for this season of communist dark ages revelations —staring bio weapons and weird ass injections.
If you know anything about the occult - it makes sense that this time around they’re using technology and bio weapons and frequency etc
Because it’s Saturn in Aquarius- which rules technology, the future, sci fi, aliens- they’re just utilizing the energy that’s most potent right now</p>

        <p>Vaccines for this virus are <em>only</em> marketing and will never be science, just like "Drink Coke!" is marketing and not science.</p>
<p>Arguably, <em>the study of the effects of</em> these vaccines could be science, just like <em>the study of the effects of</em> coke could be science, but the vaccines are no more science than coke a cola or Pepsi is science.</p>
<p>Science is <em>not</em> about making up whatever you want and then proving it.  Science is about building on science.</p>
<p>To that end: pre-existing science must not be ignored.</p>
<p>Science can be built on by demonstrating what science held before is simply wrong (like concentric crystal spheres in the heavens, or like miasmas theory), or that what science held before is sort of correct, but materially incomplete (like Newtonian physics), or by refining what's already known (like showing vitamin D is not an independent variable, but is interdependent with several other essential required nutrients like magnesium, calcium, and the K vitamins).</p>
<p>Imagine thinking that it's somehow scientific to ignore pre-existing relevant science.</p>
<p>Marketing on the other hand can, and generally should, ignore anything and everything in science that might oppose the marketing agenda.</p>
<p>Science <em>must not</em> ignore relevant science.</p>
<p>The very proposition of vaccines for this virus ignores substantial amounts of relevant scientific knowledge and evidence.  The economic sector, their many affiliates, and all of their stakeholders have fiscal self-interests in <em>everybody</em> ignoring relevant pre-existing science, and only discussing their prescribed talking points.</p>

        <p>You know seeing the “trust the $cience” folks and how they act remind me a lot of the pseudo intellectuals that formed the Rick and Morty Fandom. The show for whatever was hyped to be a show that only someone with a “extremely high IQ” could understand and enjoy by the media and so it’s popularity exploded. </p>
<p>Internet chat rooms were filled with people saying how they view everyone that doesn’t watch it as inferior and lacking in intelligence or how they pitied people who didn’t watch as simply lacking the capacity to understand its profound meaning and wisdom. </p>
<p>Media basically signals what constitutes intelligence and so not wanting to miss the latest trend the pseudo intellectuals flock to it to signal their large brains to everyone else, even if they themselves don’t get it, but they’ll highlight the talking points for it and hope no one else bothers to look deeper. That’s why they “trust the experts” is a thing, they don’t get it, but they’ll defer to someone that supposedly does and hide</p>

        <p>How so, I’m not claiming intellectual superiority, I’m claiming body autonomy. I just made a correlation that I thought was interesting. People who love to signal how virtuous they are or how intelligent they are tend to be neither virtuous nor intelligent. They notice trends that are going on, find the bare minimum of what’s going on and/or what it’s about, demonstrate it, and then puff themselves up to be just a little bit better then the average person. </p>
<p>It seemed similar to me how the fan base of Rick and Morty act, or the South Park episode where the people who got hybrids had developed a over inflated sense of self worth and superiority. It’s making note of trends and the people who follow them and how those trends that people follow are developed.</p>

        <p>The number of comments here that give the impression of not having read the article—let alone the sources the article references—is killing me. Both the UCLA professor and the “YouTuber” are PhDs in physics, and their wager, at least in the abstract, hinged on a commonly misinterpreted mathematical representation related to this particular propulsion phenomenon. Moreover, the UCLA professor wasn’t entirely wrong; he and the YouTuber were simply operating on different formulations of the problem, which the YouTuber acknowledged in part and which prompted a call for a more controlled and comprehensive experiment. The UCLA professor still paid the 10k because he was already going to donate it if he won, and he said he would not consider himself the winner if he was not correct in ALL of his claims, which he wasn’t. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xuN-9C1Gs6MAVTJkhh1vMJw0atmSsTsKDkhEfN898K4/edit#slide=id.gb6e540a45a_618_70">Further explanation can be found here.</a></p>
<p>So this post is really just a lesson in reading past the headline. It doesn’t make y’all look any less silly for being anti-vaxxers. Because unlike this application-specific problem in physics, our understanding of the human immune system, along with the efficacy and safety of vaccines, is demonstrated over decades of consistent clinical data. </p>
<p>Science still won here. And whether science works is not contingent upon whether you understand it.</p>

        <p>Yes, science works. Check out all the peer- reviewed medical journals about mRNA technology for some more actual science. </p>
<p>These papers share about historically known adverse side effects from attempts at mRNA vaccination that were SUPPOSED to be addressed before experimenting on large portions of the population. It's ironic how all the adverse side effects being reported JUST HAPPEN to be the same side effects that medical journals were warning about BEFORE the pandemic. </p>
<p>In “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology</a>,” a study less than two years old at the time of the outbreak, it shares this info about mRNA trials:</p>
<p>• ex vivo mRNA cancer treatment (where a patient’s cells are treated and then re-infused in the body) is much more effective in targeting but also more expensive than in vitro mRNA prophylactic treatments (the current vaccines): - “Ex vivo DC [dendritic cell] loading allows precise control of the cellular target, transfection efficiency and other cellular conditions, but as a form of cell therapy, it is an expensive and labour-intensive approach to vaccination. Direct injection of mRNA is comparatively rapid and cost-effective, <strong>but it does not yet allow precise and efficient cell-type-specific delivery</strong>.”</p>
<p>• mRNA inhibition of antigen can also have a negative immune response: “<strong>innate immune sensing of mRNA has also been associated with the inhibition of antigen expression and may negatively affect the immune response</strong>”</p>
<p>Another study notes that until only recent developments in the last few years, “The majority of investigations focused on DNA-based vaccines because of <strong>concerns about mRNA instability and the inefficient in vivo delivery</strong>” (“<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5987916/">Nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines</a>…”).</p>
<p>Back to the original paper, it provides additional information about recent clinical reports that were less promising:</p>
<p>• “While preclinical studies have generated great optimism about the prospects and advantages of mRNA-based vaccines, two recent clinical reports have led to more tempered expectations 22,91. <strong>In both trials, immunogenicity was more modest in humans than was expected based on animal models, a phenomenon also observed with DNA-based vaccines171, and the side effects were not trivial</strong>.”</p>
<p>• “Recent human trials have demonstrated moderate and in rare cases severe injection site or systemic reactions for different mRNA platforms22,91. <strong>Potential safety concerns that are likely to be evaluated in future preclinical and clinical studies include local and systemic inflammation, the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen, stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies and potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components.</strong>"</p>
<p>• “A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms54,166 induce potent type I interferon responses, <strong>which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity</strong> 167,168. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.”</p>
<p>• “<strong>Another potential safety issue could derive from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination. Extracellular naked RNA has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may thus contribute to oedema</strong>” 169. [oedema is “excessive accumulation of fluid, mainly water, in the tissue spaces of the body”]</p>
<p>• “Another study showed that <strong>extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation [blood clots]</strong>170. Safety will therefore need continued evaluation as different mRNA modalities and delivery systems are utilized for the first time in humans and are tested in larger patient populations.”</p>
<p>To repeat: <strong>"Safety will therefore need continued evaluation as different mRNA modalities and delivery systems are utilized for the first time in humans and are tested in larger patient populations."</strong> I don't see any real evaluation of safety happening, only the claim repeated ad infinitum that they're "safe."</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631684/">A Comparison of Plasmid DNA and mRNA as Vaccine Technologies</a>” , one of the most recent major pre-COVID medical studies about this published in June 2019, provides a clear overview of vaccines technologies as recent as six months prior to the first SARS-CoV-2 case. As it states, “the vaccine technology alone is not the only piece of the puzzle.”</p>
<p>mRNA vaccines are inflammatory in nature – “The greater inherent inflammatory nature of the mRNA vaccines is discussed for both its potential immunological utility for vaccines <strong>and for the potential toxicity. This instability of mRNA has been a significant reason for the lack of interest in mRNA as a drug.</strong>”</p>
<p>Along with the instability of mRNA, the immune system response has the potential to be harmful and not only helpful – “In addition, RNA has long been known to be an immunologically active molecule. … <strong>mRNA has a number of immunostimulatory mechanisms, which may be useful—or detrimental—for mRNA used for vaccines or cancer immunotherapeutics.</strong>”</p>
<p>The study also lists <strong>nine areas that need continued research and development for mRNA vaccines, and nine “Issues to be addressed for clinical efficacy and safety of mRNA related to inflammation,”</strong> including:</p>
<p>• “Potential toxicity of mRNA due to inherent mRNA inflammatory activity, use of unnatural modified nucleoside, and the formulations;</p>
<p>• “Several pathways of RNA-induced inflammation: TLR 3, 7, 8, plus cytoplasmic pathways</p>
<p>• “Known toxicities of drugs containing unnatural modified nucleosides</p>
<p>• “Potential mitigation or enhancement due to formulation of the mRNA</p>
<p>• “Will anti-self RNA antibodies be generated and play any role in autoimmune diseases?</p>
<p>• “Design of clinical trials to detect inflammation/toxicity due to mRNA”</p>
<p>Finally, the paper also addresses an instance where one mRNA treatment for Crigler-Najjar syndrome was halted, and systemic adverse effects in rabies mRNA vaccine testing.</p>
<p>• “<strong>Liver toxicity was observed in pre-clinical studies with one potential mRNA therapeutic delivered in lipid nanoparticles for Crigler-Najjar syndrome</strong>… These were serious enough to apparently halt the work with this particular entity, or at least that formulation [59]. The formulation of the mRNA was thought to potentially play a role in the toxicity [60], and repeat doses were used. Nevertheless, this observed toxicity may be concerning for vaccines as well, since even live replicating viruses and viral vector vaccines (which generally are more immunogenic than subunit vaccines) need repeat dosing."</p>
<p>• “In addition, most of the mRNA vaccines in clinical trials appear to need formulation. The mRNA vaccines in clinical trials against infectious diseases from this same company are described as formulated in lipid nanoparticles, but whether they are the same formulations as those used for the Crigler-Najjar study is not publicly known.”</p>
<p>• “<strong>One should also not ignore the reported toxicities seen with the rabies mRNA vaccine [55] that included limited systemic adverse effects (AEs) for the majority of patients (78%) and even grade three AEs in ~10% of patients following doses of mRNA via different routes, although the conclusions were that the vaccine was generally safe.</strong> It is not known whether the pre-clinical hepatic toxicity that proved to be a “no go” result for a particular Crigler-Najjar mRNA candidate is relevant to the mRNA vaccine studies from the same company, because, despite the low doses used, the doses and mRNA formulation for vaccine studies may be different.”</p>
<p>Statistically speaking, many people should fall into the average range of the bell curve and have mild or moderate symptoms from these novel treatments.</p>
<p>However, these studies also confirm my belief that there is a significant amount of research and progress that still needed to be made as recently as 2019, and issues described sound like an understanding of how mRNA interacts with the body and to what extent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we look at the recent Israel Pfizer study, we see the actual numbers in addition to percentages, and then we see that the vaccines aren't making much of a difference in preventing hospitalization and death, which is the reason we're being sold to take the vaccine, since it doesn't necessarily prevent you from getting sick (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00947-8/fulltext)</p>
<p>"Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were:</p>
<p>• 97·2% against COVID-19-related hospitalisation (4·6 vs ,0·3 per 100000 person-days),</p>
<p>• 97·5% against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation (2·7 vs 0·2 per 100000 person-days), and</p>
<p>• 96·7% against COVID-19 related death (0·6 vs 0·1 per 100000 person-days)"</p>
<p>The 96.7% against death is a relatively small number in both groups, with 0.6 deaths per unvaccinated versus 0.1 deaths in vaccinated in every 100000 people. The hospitalization range of 4.6 to 0.3 is also low in both, which means the fatality and hospitalization rates are low in both groups, and shows we're definitely making progress toward herd immunity.</p>

        <p>So, instead of copying and pasting something you probably didn’t understand to begin with—how about citing a specific source directly, giving me some kind of indication that you understand what that source is saying, laying out your specific objections in light of that source, and we’ll go from there…? </p>
<p>Because for what it’s worth, I am a scientist myself, and the scenario where I do all the reading you didn’t do originally—only to arrive at the conclusion that there’s some aspect of microbiology or statistics you gravely misunderstood—has outgrown its novelty. </p>
<p>I now identify as tired and, as such, need to be coaxed into this discussion with demonstrations of competence.  </p>
<p>Also, I have both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines running rampant in my system as we speak—which is perhaps a misleading way to characterize it, given that they’re only made up of salts and fats, and the mRNA component disintegrates entirely after being read by the receiving cell—but I digress. What I’m saying is I haven’t grown a third arm or developed autism yet, so I can do the whole anecdote thing if that’s what really tickles your fancy.</p>

<p>Nice straw man argument. Choosing not to get <em>this</em> vaccine doesn't make one an "anti-vaxxer." I've had all the traditional vaccines, plus a few more (military, overseas), but I'm not getting this one.</p>

        <p>The UCLA professor was completely wrong. He chose to amplify some "relevant to a few %" parasitic effects which were easily shown to be too small to change the conclusion. As a kindness, the youtuber included those tiny effects in the experiment, and showed that the final result was robust against them. Anyone with an sense of proportion could immediately see that a 1-2% effect will not change the result that in some cases the faster-than-the-wind-with-the-wind vehicle was traveling more than twice the speed of the wind. </p>
<p>The UCLA professor was simply a scientist unable to think critically. They went with their intuition that FWIW breaks thermodynamics, and produced calculations to support their gut feeling.</p>

        <p>It also seems to me that most of the time when people say "trust the science", it's science which has already been tested over and over again. The people questioning the science are rarely the ones going off to produce verifiable evidence of their view, they just point at some guy on Youtube as a reason why the science should not be trusted as if that is the end of the discussion.</p>

        <p>Gotta love YouTube’s grand contribution to the disinformation cause. The number of times I’ve been asked to consider some random chiropractor’s opinions on immunology in the past year or so is staggering.  It’s not even the inability to conduct research that surprises me. Doing good research is hard.  It’s the inability to discern when a given individual is probably not speaking on something with any relevant expertise.  I’d like to think these people would have no such trouble figuring out why they shouldn’t bring their car to the local cake shop for an oil change.</p>

        <p>Sorry, but you don't understand what science is. </p>
<p>There are many examples of the science being settled. To take an obvious example, the most closely related species to humans are chimpanzees, and the last common ancestor was about 5.5 million years ago.  There is absolutely no question about this. The science is not going to change. Period.</p>
