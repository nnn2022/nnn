        <p>Just like they said the concentration camps were fake which allowed hitler years and years to perfect his method of killing and using because people are too dumb to believe the government might actually NOT do whatâ€™s in your best interest.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this. Sincerely. We need documented proof that this happened. The elites will deny this holocaust ever took place when this is over.</p>
<p>And based on these stories, it will end with them at the end of a rope. This is outrageous. It was all fun n games with the masking and social distancing but their level of psychopathic disregard for all of humanity through this vaccination agenda is an invitation for our total and complete vengeance some day!!! <strong>We will have justice!</strong></p>

        <p>Unfortunately many people have some sort of Stockholm syndrome and will say getting vaccinated is worth it even if their kid died. I saw a clip of that woman who was paralyzed from the shoulders down, she was crying that she couldn't walk or stand up to hug her kids anymore but that she didn't want to cause fear and that people should still get vaccinated. She sounded like a domestic abuse victim saying it was her fault for provoking her abuser.</p>

        <p>I'm on your side with regard to this, and you can see so in my comment history if needed.</p>
<p>But if you want to convince people who already aren't convinced, you have to approach it carefully because millions and millions have been vaccinated and I suppose someone could make an argument that the number of people who have had serious reactions is small, considering.</p>
<p>However -- even just the reactions my own friends and family members have had... It is significant. My father in law collapsed after he got home from his second shot. His wife found him in the bathroom on the floor -- thought he was dead. He's OK now.  And a girl I know in her late 30s, was in a pretty severe 'funk' that took about 10 days to fully get out of.</p>
<p>But it does seem the side effects are more severe than traditional vaccines. (Although my uncle actually contracted polio from the original polio vaccine and it quite literally ruined his life. So things happened even back then.)</p>
<p>The point though is ---</p>
<ul>
<li>We know they don't care about our health. I mean - come on, the lockdown restrictions  just made everyone more unhealthy. More likely to catch the seasonal illness.</li>
<li>They closed parks that children rely on for exercise. They closed gyms that adults rely on for exercise. Health departments made deals with fast food companies to offer "free value meals to anyone willing to get a Covid-19 test."</li>
<li>Now fast food companies are giving free "food" to anyone who gets a vaccine.</li>
<li>They didn't encourage exercise and healthy eating and sleep. Instead they dosed people with 24/7 doom &amp; gloom, causing them to stress eat themselves into greater obesity.</li>
<li>We are a nation of obesity, with an epidemic of obesity in children. And yet -- McDonalds was considered "essential" during the lockdowns.</li>
</ul>
<p>So... We know they don't care about our health. The vaccines aren't for that.</p>
<p>And we know they REALLY want us to take them. Why?</p>
<p>Is it about money?  Partly... but if it was JUST about money then why would they use "vaccines" with such severe side effects?</p>
<p>So.. If it's not about our health &amp; saving lives and it's not about money ---</p>
<p>What is it really about?</p>
<p>What is in that damned second shot that makes it so important to them that we take it? </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1386809816530702337">https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1386809816530702337</a></p>
<p>We all know "vaccine passports" are a thing. We know digital currency is coming. </p>
<p>But what is in this vaccine that makes them obsess over us taking it?  And what will be in the next one?</p>
<p>And these side effects -- yeah, they killed a small number of people that took the vaccines. And because so many people took them, it adds up to be quite a few people... But --- what will the effect be down the line?</p>
<p>And why was an executive order passed that paved the way for faster vaccine development &amp; approval --- before Covid-19? And why did that same executive order create a "task force" which we later knew as the Covid-19 task force? All before Covid-19?</p>
<p>If you make a list of the coincidences around Covid-19 and the response to it --- the list never ends.  At some point it's not a "coincidence."</p>

<p>Not a surprise.</p>
<p>Vaccines take 7 to 55 years to make it to market.</p>
<p>You usually start with animal trials, it either kills or injures or doesn't support efficacy, so reformulate, more animal trials, if those pass, phase I human trials, usually doesn't pass the first time. Reformulate, back to animal trials, back to human trials phase I. Then phase II. Then you might reformulate again. Back to animal trials, back to phase I, back to phase II. Then if you can this far, most don't, off to market you go.</p>
<p>These skipped animal trials, had a short term rushed human trial, then into hundreds of millions of arms.</p>
<p>Basically they picked homo sapiens as the animal in the animal trials.</p>
