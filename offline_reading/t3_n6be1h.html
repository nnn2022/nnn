    <strong>How we could have handled Covid without any restrictions</strong>
    <p><ul>
<li>If an employee shows up to work sick (temperature, coughing, etc.)  they should be sent home with sick pay.</li>
<li>Businesses can refuse customers <strong>IF SOMEONE IS SHOWING SYMPTOMS OF COVID</strong>. If you are sick and showing symptoms you should be resting at home anyway just like when dealing with hm oh I don't know a common cold or flu.</li>
<li>People who buy tickets for concerts, events, etc. but show up sick should be sent home and given a refund. The refund encourages people who are sick to avoid going to a public establishment sick because they couldn't get their money back. If they are able to get their money back they would be more tempted to go back home or stay home and rest.</li>
<li>Businesses can show they care about people getting sick from Covid by putting up posts as a <strong>"REMINDER"</strong> to people to wash their hands, avoid touching your face, and <strong>GIVE PEOPLE SPACE.</strong> That's all the had to do was advise people to give others space. They didn't need to introduce this 6ft, 3ft bullshit. This also doesn't install fear into people when we are told to <strong>keep our distance</strong>.</li>
<li>Businesses can <strong>OFFER</strong> the vaccine. Not <strong>REQUIRE</strong> the vaccine. Let people decide if they should get the vaccine or not. Trying to mandate the vaccine onto people is not okay!</li>
<li>If businesses have to address masks they can <strong>ASK</strong> customers <strong>IF THEY WANT TO WEAR ONE</strong>. If a customer refuses to wear one and clearly isn't showing symptoms they should be allowed to shop.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: Okay I realize there was technically two "restrictions" where employees couldn't work sick which should be a thing anyway. Why make an employee work sick? The other one was that businesses could restrict people from shopping if they were showing clear signs of Covid. This would make sense if someone was coughing all over the place it would make everyone uncomfortable. If they are that sick they should be staying at home and resting instead of being out. </p></p>

        <p>This would have been done it was actually about protecting people. A lot of effective, logical and  common sense things would be happening right now because that's how you actually save lives.</p>
<p>Idk what it is actually about. But I can say with confidence it's not about saving lives.</p>

        <p>It really is common sense. If someone is sick they should clearly be at home resting and if it doesn't get better than let them see a doctor if staying at home and resting isn't working.</p>

        <p>In regards to all this, we let them foist upon us the fraudulent PCR test which magically caused something called "asymptomatic carriers". </p>
<p>The PCR testing of healthy people and condemning them biologically turned out to be the medical equivalent of "show me the man and I will show you the crime". Because we never dealt with the fraudulent impementation and over-cycling of the tests as citizens and demanded they be stopped, we never had a chance. People think, oh, it's just a test. But that was perhaps the most nefarious part of the plan because it allowed the elites to potentially incriminate any and every one. This mistake will ultimately be society's undoing.</p>

        <p>Even if we had completely ignored it and the worst case scenario had happened, it would have been better than what we got. We pushed hundreds of millions of people into absolute poverty, for Christs sake. They and their children are starving! If we had ignored covid, life expectancy might have been reduced to what it was in the early 2000's. You remember how we were all in a panic because people died at 81 instead of 84?</p>

        <p>Doing nothing would have been best.</p>
<p>Here's what actually happened:</p>
<p>Democratic politicians went on the air telling everyone to go enjoy parties, ride subways, not worry about Covid, etc... Then they signed executive orders forcing nursing homes to keep covid patients and refused to allow them to turn away covid sick patients.  This all caused all the deaths from March until May.</p>
<p>This was the curve that we had.  It was PLANNED.  They needed bodies.  The people in charge of this plan did everything they could with the help of the news media to create as many bodies and as much fear as they could.  Everyone knows this.  This has been confirmed.  Dr. Fauchi, the WHO, Democratic governors and mayors all insisted over and over that every American should go out in public and play in the streets.  That's been proven time and again.</p>
<p>Then, after the nursing homes pumped out as many bodies as they were going to, they suddenly flipped, screamed in terror, said it's all Trump's fault (the only one who was trying to ban flights, building medical equipment and shelters, and deploying medical ships) and then they initiated all the lockdown orders which hurt the country economically.</p>
<p>The lockdown orders didn't come until after the virus had run its course.  That's not a coincidence.</p>
<p>If we had done absolutely nothing, the virus would have gone completely unnoticed by almost everyone in the United States.</p>
<p>Hell, almost everyone in the world.</p>
<p>If we had let people and nursing homes and hospitals do what they already know how to do, almost nothing would have happened.</p>

        <p>Addon to my above comment:</p>
<p>What's rarely talked about anymore is how they bankrupted all of the hospitals and then bribed them to play along:</p>
<p>In several states including my own, they forced hospitals to stop all elective screenings and procedures.  If it wasn't life-threatening, the patients were denied service.  Hospitals everywhere laid off staff, doctors, nurses, and techs, and shut down entire wards.  Hallways and even entire floors were closed.  Hospitals now had no income UNLESS it was a covid patient and if that patient was put on a ventilator, it was worth ten times as much as a standard covid patient.  Keep in mind that vents are last resort machines.  They are death traps.  They kill more patients than they save.  If you're on a vent for more than a couple of days, you're not expected to survive.  Peer reviewed papers have been written on this subject.</p>
<p>So now, we have actual payouts for putting pneumonia patients on vents where they stay until they die.  If hospitals don't play along, they don't get the money and they go bankrupt.  The hospital where I work still hasn't recovered.  We may not make it as we are STILL forcing everyone to pass a covid test to see if they can receive treatment- yes, they are STILL being denied treatment if they pop positive unless it's life-threatening.</p>
<p>This is how I knew this was all bullshit.  Every single mandate and procedure was engineered to hurt us, not help us.</p>

<p>President Trump sent a Naval Hospital Ship to New York and California.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/18/trump-navy-ship-coronavirus-new-york-harbor-135732">Source</a></p>
<p>He had an emergency medical facility built in New York with over 2,000 beds. He shipped over a thousand ventilators to New York. Governor Cuomo announced on the air publicly that he would flat out refuse any and all help from Trump and he was true to his word- he didn't use ANY of that. He instead signed executive orders along with the governors in Michigan, New Jersey, and a few other Democrat States that forced nursing homes to keep all covid patients indoors instead of sending them to hospitals. This caused tens of thousands of deaths!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/coronavirus-government-army-corps.html">Source</a></p>
<p>Why was Covid so bad early last year? Because the governors of New York, Michigan, California, New Jersey and Pennsylvania actually signed orders that forced nursing homes to take in COVID-19 residents and keep them there. In other words, they were not allowed to send them to hospitals. This cost tens of thousands of lives. Oh and ALL of these were Democratic governors. Democrats did this on purpose.</p>

        <p>I have a cold. I'm coughing and have a slight temperature. Can I come in?</p>
<p>My baby is teething. She's coughing with a temperature. Can she come in?</p>
<p>I've just been for a jog in the woods. Got a bit of hay-fever. My temperature is up and I'm coughing a bit. Can I pop in the shops to get some bread?</p>
<p>Many jobs don't offer sick pay. So, I'll lie and say I'm fine? Are you mandating temperature checks on people?</p>

        <p>No I don't agree with stores mandating temperature checks. It's unfortunate if people lie even though they are sick in order to get into a business and shop. </p>
<p>I mean you can recognize if someone is sick. I mean really sick especially if they are coughing all over the place. If they can't walk right it means either you are drunk or light headed which at that point you shouldn't be allowed to shop because something is wrong.</p>

        <p>For the jobs that don't offer sick pay and someone is trying to work sick because they have a shift then maybe the business can offer the employee a different day to work that can make up for the one they lost.</p>
