    <p><p>Oh really? Your not allowed to still stay home?</p>
<p>‚Äî‚Äîpeople need to work for money!!!</p>
<p>Oh, how will opening change that?</p>
<p>‚Äî- more people will encounter the sick people that need money to live and they will die!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Oh, what about all the gas station clerks, grocery store workers and delivery drivers y‚Äôall have been willing to sacrifice the last year?</p>
<p>‚Äî‚Äî aaaah, grandma killer!! I‚Äôm scared to work!!!</p>
<p>But you just said people need to work? I haven‚Äôt been able to work my normal job for a year, I‚Äôd kill to have the chance to be afraid to go to work, but shutdowns take my choice, when shit is open, you still have a choice.</p>
<p>‚Äî‚Äî but it‚Äôll kill people?</p>
<p>The people that have had to endure working lockdowns the entire time and haven‚Äôt had any release like entertainment, movies or concerts and bars???</p>
<p>‚Äî‚Äî- fuck you!!! Grandma killer!!!! 
You just want to work and have everyone die!!!</p>
<p>Oof, this is getting stressful.</p></p>

        <p>I've worked through this entire scamdemic,  it hasn't been bad we have zero sick people at work out of the hundreds that work there.
And all the positive  cases I've known about have been symptoms free.</p>

        <p>And I‚Äôm sorry people think you should have to work when everything was shut down.</p>
<p>I told people it‚Äôs either 100% shutdown, or they are hypocrites for convenience if they think gas station clerks, grocery store workers or any other ‚Äúessential‚Äù jobs are safe working l, but a shutdown is needed. Doesn‚Äôt make sense. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs all convenience and looking good to them.</p>

        <p>I'm actually essential well my type of work is anyways. 
We could never shut down, but they have been very lenient with leave.
Noone is worried about the virus at work, it's actually the only place that feels semi normal.</p>

        <p>I work in more than 30 schools right in the middle of a red zone. Been doing it the whole year. I go everywhere in the schools, talk to anyone. Go into classes at the same time there is the teachers and the children.</p>
<p>Havn't been sick all year, and I have yet to see someone having anything more than a flu.</p>
<p>Classes are being shutdown because the school receives a call from the public health services to tell them they have a children who is positive or was in contact with someone positive.</p>
<p>I mean.. I'm suppose to be working in one of the worst place possible, and I go around between 30 different schools, and there is nothing.</p>
<p>All of the few stories I've heard from staff, would be old people they knew dying in a center that had other conditions and often died from something else (but was signed covid).</p>
<p>It's so damn ridiculous to me when I see people freaking out like it's the end of the world.</p>
