        <p>It's such an obvious tradeoff it's amazing to me that young people are even considering getting either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of dying? If you're under 40, you should be more afraid of driving to work than catching COVID.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of feeling crappy for a few days? Based on the Pfizer safety data, it seems much more likely that you'll feel shitty after getting the vaccine. (In the 18-55 age range, 16% with a 100.4F+ fever after the second dose. 60% with fatigue. 52% with headache. 35% chills.)</p>
<p>Are you afraid of lasting impacts? We've lived with circulating viruses for a long time - COVID's lasting impacts seem to have similar severity and incidence to things like influenza. Whereas with the vaccines we've only had them for... months?</p>

        <p>I don’t get why these people are delusional. The vaccine is literally instructing your cells to create and spit out the spike protein that is on the coronavirus, to in turn make your immune system go wonk and think it’s fighting the real thing. So in turn you’ll basically have corona symptoms except for a shorter period and without any damage (unless your symptoms are reallyyy severe).</p>

        <p>That’s how vaccines generally work. You let your body kill off a weakened version of the disease so it recognizes it and is prepared if it ever comes across the real thing. Of course it’s a lot more complicated than that but that’s the gist. The question at hand is why subject yourself to a vaccine that’ll probably give you the same symptoms as just getting the virus (if you’re young and healthy), especially considering we don’t really know the long term effects of either. It’s not like say the polio vaccine where you might be fatigued but at least you won’t get a disease that could put you in a wheelchair. Of course there’s also questions about this vaccine specifically because of how fast it was developed.</p>

        <p>Thanks to Covid research I've learned type O blood people will have less severe or symptoms of Covid. I'll say this, when I was in the Navy in boot camp I got the battery of vaccines and all was fine. That is until I got the flu shot. </p>
<p>I had never been so sick in my life. The shot was in the morning and that day was light on the exercise. I know I wasn't drinking as much fluids as normal because drowning myself after drills was normal but we had minimal drills that day. At night I was achy and had a headache and figured I might be dehydrated. I drank a ton of water and went to bed. </p>
<p>Next morning with the typical banging and jump out of your rack wake up call, I'm standing on line feeling hung over, sweaty, and dizzy, headache even worse. During inspection I threw up. They sent me to medical. I had a fever of 101°F and they put me on bed rest after they took a few samples. </p>
<p>Next day still sick, feeling even worse. Now I'm congested and coughing. They send me back to medical. Still 101°F. I'm told I'm not sick, just reacting to the flu shot. It happens apparently. "You don't have the flu, just all the symptoms of the flu". Apparently I've never had the flu before or since. </p>
<p>This goes on for the rest of the week. My fever went down to 100°F but day 3 was the worst with cramps and then slowly eased up over the next 3 days. Day seven my temp was back to normal. They put an exemption for the flu vaccine in my record (it said a specific brad I can't remember) as my reaction was considered not worth the risk even if not fatal. </p>
<p>I've never had the flu vaccine since. I'm guessing I've probably had the flu, just didn't know if type O blood saves some symptoms. My wife is type A and she usually comes down with something that doesn't affect me or the kids. </p>
<p>I've been avoiding giving the flu shot for my kids, but my daughter turned 18 and her outgoing pediatric nurse offered it and she took it, as I never said why, and kids are usually happy to not get a shot. I was concerned, but she was fine. Either she doesn't have my issue or more likely the vaccine is formulated differently from 25 years ago. </p>
<p>Now I'm droning on... Oh yeah type O people are less sensitive and as a result have a much lower viral load to be super spreaders.</p>

        <p>Somewhere on r/askscience someone asked if natural immunity after having Covid was better, the same, or not as good as the immunity from the vaccine. You could almost tell who makes money from vaccines by the debate the question caused. </p>
<p>The bottom line seemed to be the vaccine immunity "might" protect you from another strain. The conclusion seemed to be the duration of immunity is likely to be the same. There was some minor discussion on false positives and that you should still get the vaccine because of that, which sparked a downvote spiral on both sides of that argument seemingly to bury the idea that a false positive person isn't getting reinfected if later they catch Covid. </p>
<p>Reinvention so far is far below the statistical false positive rate indicating to me that immunity lasts at least the whole year this pandemic has been going on, at least for most people. I'd expect the vaccine to last just as long, or why bother given the risks.</p>

        <p>“The vaccine is literally instructing your cells to create and spit out the spike protein that is on the Corona virus” </p>
<p>“…the WHO protocols Pfizer used to produce the mRNA [for the vaccine] do not appear to identify any nucleotide sequences that are unique to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. When investigator Fran Leader questioned Pfizer they confirmed: ‘The DNA template does not come directly from an isolated virus from an infected person’.” Article by Iain Davis “What Vaccine Trials”. Once again a “vaccine” for a virus that’s never been isolated which means it doesn’t exist. Which begs the question, what exactly is this “vaccine” doing??</p>

        <p>The better your immune system, the faster your body will get rid of the virus. Young kids hardly ever spread it because their body gets rid of the virus in a matter of days or even hours. Meanwhile, old people can carry it around for months. Same thing with other viruses like the flu.</p>

        <p>Visiting that sub was the single biggest reason for me not getting the vaccine, they think they're amongst friends so they're being 100% honest.  I'm not even anti vax either, it's just that out of all the past vaccines in my life (HPV, Measles, HEP and a few others), i've never experienced anything beyond a sore arm.</p>
<p>If you're getting chills and a fever that means you're legitimately sick, that's not a vaccine/cure, that's just injecting yourself with poison.</p>

        <p>The strangest part about not being able to taste is how your brain can trick you into thinking you can taste. Hard to explain and you probably know what I’m talking about, but if you eat something familiar the brain forces taste from memory.</p>
<p>Do not eat Chinese hot mustard with not taste, the only thing that comes from it is absolute bitterness!</p>

<p>I commented "then what's the point?"</p>
<p>mere SECONDS later I got banned for 'disinformation'  or something. people on that subreddit are really delusional. I saw someone post about laminating and framing their vaccine card.</p>

        <p>That must be what it is. There wasn't even time for anyone to see my comment! Let alone see it, report it, and for a mod to ban me! Why are they creating an echochamber around getting vaccinated? They are literally so fragile and brainwashed that they cannot accept simple questions. They see questions as attacks.</p>

        <p>I mean, it makes sense to me. Just because you’re unable to get sick from the virus doesn’t mean that you won’t be able to pass the germs along to someone else who can get sick, say by having some amount of the virus on your clothes, hands, etc. and passing it along</p>

        <p>I’ve even jn your shoes before and thought the same thing. I’ve  studied  the research for decades now have a decade of support. And i do not buy into a medical intervention espoused by a flawed scientific theory. I’m not going to change your mind as I’ve read the pharmaceutical Rockefeller based research you believe supports your stance, however if you’re open to learning more about why I believe vaccines are not effective, safe, helpful or useful might I suggest reading Moth in the iron lung, virus mania, toxemia explain, the last chapter in the history of biology, the contagion myth and the poisonous needle (which is free online).</p>

        <p>You’re not alone. I did too. I followed the pharm
Backed science heavily and thought it was ethical. Then I learned it was not and that changed everything for me. I still didn’t understand though because if germ theory were true needles should not be harmful so I wanted a safe alternative. When you learn germ theory is made up garbage that blows the water off the whole thing. You realize there is no need for the poisoned needle
And that the needle is healing to create lifetime patients in a for profit death care system</p>

<p>Really I’d like to see honest research into this. I’m sure there are a lot of psychosomatic reactions, allergies to additives etc. But it’s important to know reactions to the vaccine itself but because it’s being treated like a Fountain of Youth there’s simply no stomach for skepticism.</p>

        <p>I agree.  I don't mind vaccines, and given the extent of my world travel, I have probably had more than most.  This thing though is just not trustworthy.  A new type of vaccine for a type of virus we have never made a vaccine for, developed and deployed in under a year, little to no information on side effects, developers admitting that they don't fully understand what it does or how.</p>
<p>I was on a meeting with a bunch of doctors and nurses today who all got the second dose yesterday.  They were all sick, every one of them talking about how miserable they felt.  One said "I'm glad I feel this way, it means it is working."</p>

        <p>I’m aware. Supposedly it only produces the spike protein, which is the one that penetrates cells; but not the ones that make you sick... I suppose the provoked immune response is what could be making people feel bad. But the response shouldn’t be so noticeable.</p>

        <p>Most vaccines dont have the kinds of serious symptoms they are describing. If you are having numbness in your limbs, migraines that last for days, persistent high fever and difficulty with eyesight, that shit needs to be reported. I dont know how they can convince themselves that it's healthy and just means it's "working".</p>

        <p>I guess itll be hard for women to have babies if they have guillain barre, migraines, and god knows what else. Or they bodies react negatively to pregnancy because they were injected with fetal cells? </p>
<p>Vaccines are known to cause guillain barre. Theres a good reason vaccines need years of testing. </p>
<p>Its bizarre that they want everyone to get tested. Maybe so theres no control group? Low risk young people dont need this vax. Why not just give it to old people? I think if only old people get it that stats will look bad. If wont look good if we only give it to 85 year olds with diabetes who die soon afterwards.</p>

        <p>The covid vaccines are killing old people.  We don't need a vaccine.  We already have treatments that are proven to save lives and they have just finally been approved now that Biden is in office.</p>
<p>The vaccine isn't about saving lives.  It's about letting the government inject or implant you with anything at all if they deem it's for the "public good".  It's also about transhumanism, which is really the new face of the eugenics movement.  And we all know what Hitler and the Nazi's did with that.</p>

        <p>It's really not that crazy or unheard of to have strong but temporary reactions to any vaccine. If that was the only possible downside, shit, I'd be lining up for it as well.</p>
<p>The issue I have is that there is potential for long term negatives that we just don't know about. I should also point out that we will never really know what the possible long term effects are because society has shifted to a point where the establishment will face exactly zero repercussions for covering up data that does not support their narrative. In fact people will actively cheer when such data is covered up because they've been so effectively brainwashed into thinking data can be "dangerous" and <em>must</em> be erased.</p>
