<p>I was looking into how they tested the COVID-19 "vaccines" on animals. I haven't seen any reports of massive dead animals due to COVID-19, in fact, I don't think I've even seen one report of an animal dying from COVID-19. Gave me two thoughts, which I'll post in a different thread.</p>

        <p>They are planning on euthanizing the animals. I forget where Ive recently read this but they don’t want us having pets anymore. It will be part of the UN global climate change agenda. Agenda 2030 I believe. It’s possible I read it there but not sure. I was appalled at the lengths these people will go to to use their agendas to control every aspect of our lives. Another thing I read &amp; have seen videos on is about “owning nothing and being happy”. 
They are even going to make us rent clothing &amp; all the items we have in our homes, including our cars. Unsure how they think they will accomplish these things. </p>
<p>But the culling of the pets &amp; not allowing us to own them is what thoroughly disgusted me. My guess is this fake story about pets getting COVID could be part of that overall agenda.</p>

        <p>The scary part is many of the vaxxed will do it without issue if it will "save others" or "for the greater good." If they are okay with killing off their pets it isn't too far of a jump to killing off their fellow man. That would be obvious next progression. Scary times...</p>

        <p>Yes they have to do this all in steps. This is headed in a very bad direction &amp; these people won’t even look at other info or research &amp; are so arrogant in how they don’t care about half the population. This is the real brainwashing right there. They got them where they want them in their hatred for certain groups of people, that they will willingly participate, &amp; not care when the future atrocities happen to the groups of people they have been conditioned to hate. These people, even though many are for animal rights now, will be so conditioned to doing what government tells them,  without question, all of these things will be nothing to them.</p>
