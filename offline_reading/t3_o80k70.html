    <strong>Why not seeing ADE already from vaccine? Also is the vaccine a kill shot?</strong>
    <p><p>I am no means an anti vaxxer, I just don't like this covid vax, I keep hearing people say that the vaccine will kill everyone in 6-18 months from ADE. I also.listen to Mike Adam's who thinks the vaccine will kill most people that get the shot. My question is why are we not seeing massive deaths from the vaccine? I know the VAERS has reported 6000k deaths. And how long does spike protein stay in body?</p></p>

        <p>Whether some vaxxes are placebo or not, there has been too many deaths and side effects just to claim coincidence. I know lots of people that are vaxxed and almost all of them had no side effects whatsoever. This has me question the more extreme theories of depopulation etc. But I guess time will tell if it’s just a scam to make the Rich richer or if there is something more evil at hand. How people are not questioning the endless lockdowns and mask mandates is beyond me. I was blinded by the propaganda but a couple of months ago I really started to question things and I truly believe we are at a turning point in history if we don’t make a stand for our human rights.</p>

        <p>The theory goes that ADE will either manifest in the next flu season when the immune system encounters a wild coronavirus and overreacts , or at a later date within a couple of years when the TPTB trigger it manually using an actual lab created pathogen that triggers the overreaction, and call it "bioterror attacks". </p>
<p>Whether it will actually come to pass, who knows. There is some scientific discussion about this and past animal trials of mRNA point to something like this being possible, but I doubt many know this with full certainty yet. </p>
<p>Also it's not about how long the spike protein itself stays in the system but how the immune system and white blood cells have been trained to produce an overresponse to it, and that training lasts a lifetime probably.</p>

        <p>Nobody knows if the vaccine is a kill shot. Nobody knows the long term side effects. Nobody knows if this will affect our DNA or our children's DNA permanently. But one thing I do know. I would rather chance a virus with a 99.9% survival rate for someone my age. Then risk being a lab rat for a money hungry pharmaceutical company financed by people really worried about climate change and population control. That to me throws up instant red flags. But hey I don't have a high IQ and don't have fancy letters next to my name. I can't possibly read and understand research papers. Definitely don't have the mental aptitude to listen to opposing opinions and decipher what sounds logical and what sounds completely insane.</p>

        <p>Ade might already be occurring at a low rate i made a post about it. Seems like the next thing is a variant that causes worse ade at the level of the sars-cov-1 trials</p>

        <p>Probably because that would be very disruptive. They are giving many people placebos and requiring boosters, each of which have a portion of real and placebo doses so that it happens over time.</p>

        <p>It's been about a year since the 1st people.got the shots and I think if there was going to be a massive death rate they would have been the 1st to go and we prob would have heard something about it by now.</p>

<p><strong>F. William Engdahl writes:</strong></p>
<p>”Even the US Centers for Disease Control <strong>(CDC) a notoriously political and corrupt agency with for-profit ties to vaccine makers,</strong> in its official Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), shows a total of 193,000 “adverse events” including 4,057 deaths, 2,475 permanent disabilities, 25,603 emergency room visits, and 11,572 hospitalizations following COVID-19 injections between December 14, 2020 and May 14, 2021. That included the two mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna, and the far less prevalent J&amp;J Janssen vaccine. Of the reported deaths, 38% occurred in people who became ill within 48 hours of being vaccinated. The official US vaccine-related death toll is greater in just 5 months than all the vaccine-related deaths from the past 20 years combined. Yet the major media worldwide and the US Government virtually bury the alarming facts.</p>
<p>Some 96% of the fatal results were from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the two variants funded and promoted by the Gates Foundation and Tony Fauci’s NIAID with the experimental mRNA genetic technology. Moreover, Dr. Tony Fauci, the US Biden Administration vaccine czar and his NIAID Vaccine Research Center co-designed the Moderna mRNA vaccine and gave Moderna and Pfizer each $6 billion to produce it. That’s also a blatant conflict of interest as Fauci and his NIAID are allowed to financially benefit from their patent earnings in the vaccine under a curious US law. The NIAID developed the coronavirus spike proteins for the development of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines using taxpayer money. They licensed it to Moderna and Pfizer.”</p>
<p>“These examples are indicative of the fact that we are literally exposing the human race via untested experimental gene edited mRNA vaccines to incalculable dangers which in the end may exceed by far any potential risk of damage from something which has been called SARS-Cov-2. Far from the much-touted miracle substance proclaimed by WHO, Gates, Fauci and others, the Pfizer, Moderna and other possible mRNA vaccines clearly hold potentially tragic and even catastrophic unforeseen consequences. <strong>Little wonder some critics believe it is a disguised vehicle for human eugenics.”</strong></p>

        <p>It will start this winter and going forward. Their immune system has been primed to only respond to the covid19, so any new variants will go right through their defense system and most likely kill them. It wil look like Covid21 but it will be because of failing immune system.</p>
