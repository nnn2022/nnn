    <strong>Lifter experiencing muscle and joint pain 1 month since COVID vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>In the comments there are many others saying they got similar symptoms.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/mn0amu/body_wide_joint_and_surrounding_muscle_aches_pain/</p>
<p>&rt;30 yo male, active (gym 6 x a week), healthy diet (don't drink often, don't smoke, I even cut out coffee in the months leading to my vaccine dose)</p>
<p>&rt;Received my first dose of Moderna in early March - I haven't been the same since.</p>
<p>&rt;One day after my first dose, I began experiencing a mild chest discomfort (upper left area) radiating out my back and arm. Walked into an urgent care and while EKG was fine, they suggested I go to the ER for further evaluation. I did and they found a slight elevation of troponin (an enzyme that can point to heart damage) so they kept me overnight. Vitals checked periodically throughout the night and day and even an ultrasound of my heart was done - nothing abnormal. A slightly "low" HR but they said likely due to my training at the gym and likely the cause of my pain for overworking some muscle group. Sent home with ibuprofen, rest and recovery and follow up with PCP.</p>
<p>&rt;Since that event, the symptoms have overtaken my entire body. Elbows, shoulders, arms, legs, knees, hands and feet all have varying degrees of achiness, dull pain, etc. Day to day it's different in where the pains are and it's severity but my life has come to a complete halt.</p>
<p>&rt;I've had a lot of blood work done (ESR for inflammation, ANA for Lupus and other autoimmune diseases, Anti CCP, Lyme, Rheumatoid Factor and metabolic panel) and all are within normal ranges. Waiting on a HLBA27 genetic test for predispositions but so far my PCP and Rheumotologist haven't settled on a definitive diagnosis. My Rhuemo currently has two other patients in my age group that are experiencing the same symptoms post vaccine and we're currently on short course treatment of steroids. He is fairly certain that this is some type of inflammatory overreaction to the vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt;Has anyone else experienced this? Did it end? What did it take?</p>
<p>&rt;While I support the vaccine, If I had known this was a possible outcome - I would not have hopped on line. I'm trying to remain hopeful that this will subside but more people should be aware of this outcome as it has been the worst health experience of my life and is ongoing without any real answers. Just a hope that my body will just figure it out and get back to normal...</p>
<p>&rt;If anyone has answers or is further ahead of me in this adverse event, please let me know. I am happy to share any knowledge I gather through my healing. I need all the information I can get to get out of this or at least know there is a light at the end of the tunnel so I can get my life back.</p></p>

        <p>They say stuff like that to appease the herd. They dont want to be socially ostracized. Its like saying "ofcourse I believe in god, Im just wondering when he will start acting" they have to verify their faith so they dont get deemed an "anti vaxxer" or "racist" somehow</p>

        <p>Used to see the same tactic concerning Trump all the time. People would post about being fed up with how much negative press he received, but they would also post the disclaimer of "Don't get me wrong, I fucking HATE Trump, I think he's a total asshole moron buffoon Nazi, but DAE think the media needs to blah blah blah" </p>
<p>People are just scared of downvotes.</p>

        <p>Oh my god. 
It's like Stockholm syndrome over there. </p>
<p>Quote: It’s crazy to me that these stories aren’t being put out in the media enough. I understand the importance of vaccination and the overall rarity of these severe reactions but although rare they ARE happening to REAL people with lives, families, jobs, commitments, etc. Thankfully I’m lucky to have a remote job with full insurance to navigate this. But I imagine many others aren’t as lucky and this should be known! [Quote by OP]</p>
<p>While it’s made it a little harder for me to do my usual visit to Dr Google, I am happy the media isn’t putting out too many anecdotal stories about side effects because that would be used as anti-vaccine fodder and probably slow down if not completely stop our work towards herd immunity. [Response from some guy]</p>
<p>And another one saying they have autoimmune issues but will gladly take feeling bad and having an exacerbation of their condition than "risk long-term damage of the virus".</p>
<p>Which might as well cause a mild flu in them and nothing else. 
Holy hell these people are brainwashed</p>
