        <p>This. In my province, they told us 7 in 10,000 asymptomatic people test positive. So basically if you have no symptoms, you don't have anything to spread. This mask bullshit assumes everyone is a walking disease vector.</p>

        <p>I've been banned multiple times for posting several studies that clearly demonstrate that people with no symptoms don't spread covid. I've been banned for posting reports showing that if PCR tests were conducted normally instead of with an insane number of cycles, 70-90% of positives would go away. </p>
<p>People just don't want to hear facts. They want to hear that face diapers are their savior and anyone who doesn't wear one is just a bad person. Classic emotional reasoning and us vs them.</p>

        <p>This is true, except for crosscontamination - e.g someine sneezes on a door handle, you touch door handle, then let someone suck on your hand :)</p>
<p>But: You can have the disease and spread it without experiencing any symptoms at all. In fact, most people are very infectious 2 to 3 days before they develop any symptoms, that is why Covid19 is so hard to contain. And that's why mask usage in many (not all) scenarios makes sense even if you feel well.</p>

        <p>They derived that conclusion by examining throat swabs. They offer the correlation <em>high viral load=high transmission</em>.</p>
<p>But the primary vector of transmission is coughing and sneezing. Which obviously isn't happening in the case of an asymptomatic person.</p>
<p>So you'll pardon me if I raise my eyebrow.</p>

        <p>To quote from the "Matters arising" also on the page I linked to:</p>
<p>"Although the levels of infectious virus needed to achieve COVID-19 transmissibility are unknown, the best way to determine transmission potential is from carefully conducted epidemiological studies that determine the proportion of presymptomatic versus post-symptomatic spread. A review of several COVID-19 case studies5 found multiple instances of transmission before symptom onset. However, it is difficult to determine the proportion of pre- and post-symptom onset transmission from individual case studies. "</p>
<p>So I recommend you look at those epidemiological studies cited...</p>

        <p>People still do breathe and emit droplets and smaller aerosols when speaking, singing, shouting. Sure, you are probably emitting more of your spittle when you cough, but there is excellent evidence that you emit droplets when speaking, shouting, singing.. Do you just believe that or do you also want citations (I can find them, but don't have them bookmarked. But this is really common sense, even if you don't believe in aerosol transmission)</p>

        <p>Sure, but when you are presymptomatic and people do not keep a distance, you seem to still be easily able to infect others. And this does happen with Covid19, there are many cases of documented superspreading events even with presymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic (non-sneezing / coughing) people.</p>

        <p>I think Covid would have been under control a long time ago if it would not be for undetected transmission due to presymptomatic, asymptomatic and very mildly symptomatic people. The risk of Covid19 which makes it reasonable to mandate masks is high if it spreads uncontrolled through a population. And masks are one of those ways to put some checks on it's spread which are least intrusive into personal freedoms and harmful to the economy - when compared with real lockdown measures - e. g. enforced social distancing.</p>
<p>And no, I don't just count deaths as the outcome to prevent. I also consider possible long term effects (like heart disease, depression, kidney disease, chronic fatigue syndrome etc.) I don't think their probability after Covid19 has been finally established, but I find the reports about them credible enough to want to avoid the risk.</p>

        <p>SARS-1 was a much more deadly disease. But as far as I know, it only spread through symptomatic people who had fever etc. So it could be stopped much more easily. The presymptomatic transmission is what makes Covid19 so dangerous. And I knew this right from the moment when the first detailed reports about (mildly symptomatic) patient zero in Germany circulated. That was in January IIRC. That patient, a business traveler from China, only had headaches and slight bodily aches. No coughing or sneezing. Still she infected others during an indoor meeting of less than an hour.</p>

<p>Speaking as a mask enthusiast, why do people wear a mask when alone and driving in their car?</p>

        <p>This happens when you are driving from one location where you weared a mask to another one where you plan to do the same. It's just not worth the trouble of having to properly take off the mask, store it properly and put it on again. You just keep it where it is...</p>
<p>Or: You are driving around with someone else who is maybe high-risk  and take every precaution you can. I did that when driving around my wife's grandma who is 90 years old.</p>
<p>Another explanation is: Because the person is stupid. But I guess that's not the norm.</p>

        <p>From <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?fbclid=IwAR0ULN8J0yuwpkr5Fzn6iJQsVsAFkYFuy_-0I7WX_38I02TRcf1NmlHcRj8">New England Journal of Medicine</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers</em> <strong><em>little, if any, protection from infection</em></strong>. <em>Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</em> <strong><em>The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal</em></strong>*. <em>In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."*</em></p>
<p>You said something interesting : "when you are presymptomatic and people do not keep a distance, you <strong>seem</strong> to still be easily able to infect others."</p>
<p>Fauci has said himself that epidemics are historically driven by symptomatic people and not presymptomatic nor asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Also you said, "The risk of Covid19 which makes it reasonable to mandate masks is high if it spreads uncontrolled through a population."</p>
<p>I would argue there is very little risk considering the patch work of mandates across this country and the fact that infection rates were extremely low in places that were lax on their restrictions like Sweden where their mortality rate remained steady throughout these 8 months. And while one could point to their smaller population and the fact that their per capita was higher in terms of mortality, the fact that the death rate and IFR is lower than countries with more stringent measures is telling. Also the most at risk all over the world are those over 65 with co-morbidities and NOT the general population.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions#:~:text=Airborne%20transmission%20is%20defined%20as,long%20distances%20and%20time">WHO</a> : "<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols</em></strong>*.(13-16) These* <strong><em>theories</em></strong> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2  required to cause infection in another person are</em> <strong><em>not known</em></strong>*, <em>but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"*</em></p>
<p>Interestingly the end of the next paragraph reveals : "<em>To date, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by this type of aerosol route</em> <strong><em>has not been demonstrated</em></strong>*; <em>much more research is needed given the possible implications of such route of transmission.*"</em></p>
<p>I have not worn a mask this entire ordeal and don't plan on wearing one ever yet I'm still fine. Of course that is only anecdotal evidence but I would argue all evidence is anecdotal since whomever is recording the data is having a personal experience regardless of the setting or who is funding it, lol. On a serious note I have seen cases where people were isolated in lockdown, took all recommended precautions and still were infected.</p>
<p>Also from the NEJM: "<em>The extent of marginal benefit of universal masking over and above these foundational measures is</em> <strong><em>debatable</em></strong>*. <em>It depends on the prevalence of health care workers with asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic infections as well as the relative contribution of this population to the spread of infection.*</em> <strong><em>It is informative, in this regard, that the prevalence of Covid-19 among asymptomatic evacuees from Wuhan during the height of the epidemic there was only 1 to 3%.</em></strong><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?fbclid=IwAR0ULN8J0yuwpkr5Fzn6iJQsVsAFkYFuy_-0I7WX_38I02TRcf1NmlHcRj8#"><strong><em>4,5</em></strong></a> <em>Modelers assessing the spread of infection in Wuhan have noted the importance of undiagnosed infections in fueling the spread of Covid-19 while also acknowledging that</em> <strong><em>the transmission risk from this population is likely to be lower than the risk of spread from symptomatic patients</em></strong>*.*<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?fbclid=IwAR0ULN8J0yuwpkr5Fzn6iJQsVsAFkYFuy_-0I7WX_38I02TRcf1NmlHcRj8#"><strong><em>3</em></strong></a> <em>"</em></p>
<p>This seems in line with Lord Fauci's assertion that symptomatic people are the main drivers of this "pandemic".</p>
<p>Still, considering most people are not as vigilant as health care workers I personally think the mask give a false sense of safety, not to mention there are harmful effects of people who are not trained like health care professionals regarding proper usage. I know of multiple people using the same mask for days on end (they get expensive you know) and the surgical mask in particular should be discarded after about 25 minutes especially if you sweat in them, and even if you don't, your breath dampens the material making them bacterial traps and useless.</p>

        <p>First of all, I don't consider Fauci as an expert on Covid himself. I'm from Germany, and as it happens we have one of the world's most renowned Coronavirus experts, Professor Chrostian Drosten, an Epidemiological Virologist, who actually started to explain the science and his outlook to the general population throughout the Pandemic. He is the person who developed the test for SARS1 and the first and most widely used test for Covid19 (the one adopted by the WHO). So mentioning "Lord Fauci" doesn't really ring a bell with me. 
I also consider Eric Topol and Sandra Ciesek, as well as a few other people as top notch experts who also happen to communicate their thoughts well.</p>
<p>Anyway: yes, there is ongoing scientific discussion as to the efficacy of face masks, and particular about homemade/ cloth masks. Given that there is no standardized way for their manufacture, naturally, results as to their effiacy vary. </p>
<p>There are several newer studies than the one you cited, which come to the conclusion that masking policies help. Here are a few</p>
<p>https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-07-08-oxford-covid-19-study-face-masks-and-coverings-work-act-now
https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/36/eabd3083
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7191274/
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-0948_article</p>
<p>All of that said, I always recommend to use either Surgical Masks (to protect others) or at least cheap KN95 for at least some degree of self protection. And if I look around in my local supermarket, this is what most (60 to 70 % I guess) people actually use by now. I am also all for educating people of how to properly handle and reuse masks. As far as I know, it is pretty safe to reuse a properly dried KN95 after 5 days or so, or if you heat them carefully to 80 degrees for an hour. I combine heating and waiting for a day, which should be pretty safe given that I am no HCW. So a simple KN95 or FFP2 mask for less than 1 euro can serve me several weeks. </p>
<p>I don't buy the argument that improperly handled masks or wet masks are worse than no masks. If you have a contaminated mask, it is probably contaminated by yourself anyway. Low risk of additional infections. Even a completely wet mask modifies the airflow and will retain some particles. Even if it just delays virus particle release by a few minutes, that may be enough to have inactivated a proportion of the viral particles. </p>
<p>For me, the masks are just a minor inconvenience. I know someone with COPD, she tells me that she has trouble with prolonged waring of a medical-grade N95 equivalent (e. g. for more than 2 hours or so), but can wear surgical masks without any breathing problems at all. She is obviously high risk, so she does wear masks primarily to protect herself.</p>
<p>Mind you, the argument for bacteria is a completely different one. But I am not too worried about bacteria at the moment..</p>
<p>When it comes to Sweden, there is widespread misunderstanding about what they did.
 https://www.healtheuropa.eu/swedens-response-to-covid-19-life-is-not-carrying-on-as-normal/101515/
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_government_response_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic</p>
<p>In effect, they had a slightly less restrictive response than comparable neighboring countries, but also had a worse outcome and it took longer for them to mitigate the first wave. I think here in Germany the impact and restrictions that we had to place ourselves under was lower and shorter. Overall I don't think that their response or outcome was better than, for example, Germany's. (Which does have a much higher population density). They had a pretty high death rate until they often voluntarily applied social distancing. </p>
<p>No, comparisons with Italy, France and Spain are not fair, given that these countries have a higher pop. density and a culture of social closeness.</p>

        <p>Last Update to the paper is from August. I also recommend to look into the "Matters arising" from 20th of August where newer findings are mentioned. It's all there, including citations of recent supporting studies as well as data which contradicts it (but not to the point that there is no presymptomatic transmission. The question is only how much)</p>

        <p>My husband and I have started doing the same. Its actually very rare someone says something, if they do they don't ask you to leave or even put up a fight anymore. Most store employees at most places have been advised not to say anything because the company doesn't want to risk a physical altercation.  If everyone started doing this it would be over already.</p>

        <p>I would hope the company needs my money more than kicking me out because I can quietly walk out and take my business elsewhere. That was my thinking. Forgot some people fight about it lol</p>

        <p>Full support from me ! We've never used a mask and neither do our kids.
We take our business to those that support adults making decisions about their own body and children - funny how the tables turn on that one, huh ? </p>
<p>We're in the Midwest and only once have been approached by an employee, once turned away from a Game Stop... Tons of dirty looks and whispers and with so many stories of arrests, jailings, ankle monitors, and physical altercations over this bullshit I actually dread leaving the house now. 
I had a panic attack last time I went out alone because all o could do was hyper focus on everyone's masks and not being able to see what anyone looks like on the rare/off chance I needed a physical description.
Next time I had to ask my husband to come with me because I was afraid of a repeat panic.</p>
