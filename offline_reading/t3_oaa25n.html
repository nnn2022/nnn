    <strong>Mass Psychogenic Illness</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;Mass psychogenic illness (MPI), also known as epidemic hysteria, 
mass hysteria and mass sociogenic illness, has been reported for 
centuries and from all corners of the world, and is not uncommon in 
the UK. Whereas in the past, episodes were attributed to witchcraft, 
possession and malicious poisoning, today they are often attributed to 
perceived exposure to chemicals or radiation, and can thus present a 
challenge for public health response.
&rt;
&rt; <strong>What is mass psychogenic illness?</strong>
&rt;
&rt;MPI can be defined as ‘widespread, subjective symptoms thought to 
be associated with environmental exposure to a toxic substance, in 
the absence of objective evidence of an environmental cause’ (Jones 
et al., 2000).
&rt;
&rt;In other words, incidents involve two or more people 
who share beliefs as to the cause of their symptoms, although no 
source can be found that adequately explains the symptoms reported.
&rt;
&rt;As there is no biological basis for the symptoms experienced, 
symptoms reported vary between incidents, but can also vary within 
the epidemic, making it hard to develop a case definition. Two 
syndromes have been described: motor variant, where motor effects 
such as hysterical dancing, laughing, convulsions, pseudoseizures are 
more common, and anxiety variant, where symptoms may include 
nausea, vomiting, headaches, shortness of breath and confusion 
(Wessely, 1987).
&rt;
&rt;The latter is more commonplace in the UK and Europe, associated 
with perceived toxic exposure. Two examples of mass psychogenic 
incidents are described in the boxes.
&rt;
&rt;MPI incidents are by their very nature diverse, with triggers and 
spreading mechanisms varying between incidents. Boss (1997) 
reviewed reports of MPI and found the following themes to be 
common:
• incidents may be triggered by events, such as a real chemical 
 exposure, but the health response to these events goes beyond 
 what can be toxicologically explained 
• the presence of an odour, real or perceived, can trigger incidents 
• the affected group is often already under psychological stress, 
 such as poor work conditions, exam stress or concern about a 
 nearby chemical company or mobile phone mast
• incidents are more common in ‘closed’ communities such as 
 schools, workplaces, factories and hospitals
• there is often an ‘index case’ from which the ‘contagion’ spreads, 
 and spread is by ‘line of sight’, e.g. from friend to friend
• symptoms often spread from older or authoritative individuals to 
 younger and lower-status individuals
• females are at a greater risk than males
• most incidents are short-lived, especially if in a school or workplace, 
 but episodes in the community and family may last longer.</p>

        <p>I assume you’re bringing this up because of Long COVID?</p>
<p>Yes, that’s a psychogenic illness. Only about 20% of Long COVID “sufferers” have ever even tested positive for COVID.</p>
<p>Long COVID “sufferers”
are about 80-85% female, like the “sufferers” of other physiogenic  illnesses.</p>
<p>I’m not even going to get started on how some Long COVID “sufferers” report getting better after getting vaccinated.</p>
