<p>"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. <em>That’s</em>  the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come  immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would  have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews  in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the  windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it  happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them  imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next.  Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a  stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.</p>
<p>"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of  them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too  heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more  than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you  see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely  under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not  the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all  untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the  mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the  spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of  identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of  hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it  themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you  live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The  system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in  order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.</p></p>
