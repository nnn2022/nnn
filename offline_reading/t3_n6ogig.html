        <p>Ah, luckily we didn't have to wear them during the summer. Sometime around the middle of the year, but can't remember when exactly. We've had so many lockdowns and so many changing restrictions that it's all a blur.</p>

        <p>Canadian here, in the same boat my friend. Technically we've only had 3 "official" lockdowns but there's been red zones, grey zones, high risk areas, stay at home orders. Basically beery month same new BS that's impossible to keep up with.</p>

        <p>Oh no, Canada is just as bad, if not worse. Yeah I think we've only had 3 official ones as well but I mean even now we have a bunch of restrictions while not technically being in lockdown. And of course the borders have been shut for over a year now. No one can leave the country without getting an exemption from the government and they aren't letting citizens return either. </p>
<p>It's still hard to believe that all of this is happening, that it's not just a fever dream. Last year we were only allowed to leave the house for four reasons (essential shopping, essential work, care giving, essential medical care), we needed a work permit each week that showed our shifts/hours in case we were stopped by police (thousands of dollars in fines if caught without one, $19,000+ for your employer), only one person per household was allowed to go shopping for groceries once a day, we had to stay within 5km of our place of residence unless we were going to work or receiving essential medical care, we had an 8:00 pm - 5:00 am curfew, we weren't allowed to meet up with anyone outside of our homes (no guests, no family, nothing, not even in a bloody park), we had a limit of 1 hour of exercise a day, had no schools open for 1/3 of the year, had mandatory masks outside our own homes at all times ($200 on-the-spot fine if caught without one), faced a $5000 fine if we were caught outside our house for any non-permitted reason, and we weren't allowed to leave our state or to go elsewhere unless it was for essential work or unless we had permission from the government because of special circumstances... just to name a few.</p>

        <p>Wow that is an actual nightmare. I didn't know how bad you guys had it there. Here the only thing that's been worse is that winters are extremely cold made the lockdown somehow feel worse. But we only recently had police enforcing fines and people were so outraged that local policy pretty mulch refused to enforce it. I am worried though since it seems like our measures are only getting more and more strict as time goes on.  We have 2 weeks left in the stay at home order and yet again, our "science table" is saying they think its too soon and we should extend it based on modeling data. I wish I was dreaming but knowing this shit is actually happening with no signs of letting up is heartbreaking.  You never want to believe that your country could go so wrong but here we are. I want to believe things will get better, but at this point, I really don't know how they will unless people fully wake up and make a stand against this garbage.</p>

        <p>I have. Still not sure if it's real but its definitely very concerning and if it is, would explain a lot.  Right now just trying to keep my ear to the ground and see what I can do here to support protests and what not to try to fight back against this. I love my country but I hate our government for what they've done to us and I'm not willing to give up on this place yet.</p>

        <p>Yes. There's a Global Freedom Rally/protest on the 15th, in a week or so. Hundreds of cities all around the world are participating - you can check online to find your nearest one! It's going to be my first time attending one of these, hopefully we'll have several thousand people here in Melbourne.</p>
