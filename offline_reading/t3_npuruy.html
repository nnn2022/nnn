    <strong>How do you reconcile the idea that COVID is a bioweapon/engineered to be deadly, versus the idea that it's not deadly and is a hoax?</strong>
    <p><p>So, a little about me: I've believed COVID came from a lab since some point in 2020 (early on in the pandemic I think) although I wasn't sure if it was natural source but then accidental leak, or engineered to be "worse" but then also accidental leak. I played with the idea that it was deliberately released but ultimately realised if that were to happen then it would probably be much more deadly, or be harder on young people.</p>
<p>(I know not everyone here agrees, that's fine, I'm just really curious about this)</p>
<p>All that said, I understand why someone could look at the facts and think this was a lab leak. Frankly I thought it was ridiculous that "experts" were refuting this as if it was a totally absurd premise, all the way last year. I say this as someone who doesn't like Trump at all- it really seemed like just because Trump said something, there was a kneejerk reaction to oppose it, even if he was only right by coincidence.</p>
<p>Although I disagree, I can see why someone would look at certain facts and think covid isn't serious and it's a hoax. Certain things were inflated, such as the CFR in the early days (although to be clear, I very much think it's real and worth avoiding.)</p>
<p>What I DON'T understand is how someone can simultaneously think gain of function research engineered a supervirus, and that supervirus is also not serious and we don't have to worry about catching it. But I've seen people espouse both of these views at once, so can someone explain to me how this makes sense? I'm not trying to be an asshole, I'm genuinely confused.</p></p>

        <p>It can be bioengineered and not be a supervirus.  It could be a weapon designed to create uncertainty, distraction, and panic.  It could be engineered to be used for a specific purpose, in conjunction with people planning on trying to paralyze nations and crash economies.  </p>
<p>There's lots of things you could do with a virus.  Not only that, but it could also have just been an accidental release from the workers in the lab not following safety protocols after being bitten by bats in the lab.</p>

        <p>This.  THEY will never release a supervirus that they cannot control because it would wipe everyone out, indluding those that designed it.</p>
<p>It is deadly enough for the old and immunocompromised.  The CV-19 vaccinations are the real bioweapons.</p>

        <p>So I agree that it was likely an accidental release of a virus that was found in nature (my #1 theory honestly) but that's neither a hoax or a bioweapon. </p>
<p>Per your first thought, why create a bioweapon specifically to create panic when you could create one to kill the workforce?</p>

        <p>Look at the population that is most likely to die, the elderly and the infirm.</p>
<p>China has a problem with too many old folks now and not enough young people to work to support them.  Kill off the old folks and the infirm and you are left with the young and healthy without burden of paying for elder care.</p>
<p>Coincidence that the virus mortality rate for the people under 50 is less than 1%....  Maybe they thought they could contain it better and it just got out of control?</p>

        <p>Covid wasn’t as potent as they thought it would be. Our innate immune system had pretty much beat it with surprisingly low death rates considering it’s  origins.  Turns out over half of Americans have antibodies and many others didn’t even get sick enough to need to produce antibodies.  This disease was on its way out the door and was being propped up by number manipulation.  That’s why they needed to roll out the vaccine so quickly. Both use spike proteins to attack our bodies and the symptoms can be indistinguishable.</p>

        <p>The fact that they're still pushing variants akin to the "impending doom" type narrative despite nothing ever really panning out according to the fearmongering just deepens doubt about everything to come out moving forward.</p>
<p>There's a conspicuous absence of any assurances or relief when biblical death rates fail to materialize,  The mainstream propaganda industry just pivots to the next budding catastrophe in waiting doing everything they can to cultivate worry and terror.</p>

        <p>I think the spike protein is the bioweapon. Studies have shown that the vaccine is 10-20x more harmful than the virus.  I want to believe that those of us with strong enough immune systems can defeat whatever is in the vaccine just as those of us with strong immune systems can defeat covid.   Turns out ivermectin has worked as well for long haul covid and vaccine injuries. Between those two covid shouldn’t be a worry. That information is being suppressed so that we can force everyone into getting the shot.</p>

        <p>I don't think it was engineered to be very deadly, it was just engineered to easily infect people. Maybe they were trying to make it worse and it leaked by accident before they got that far, maybe infectivity was all they wanted. As I mentioned in a different thread, it can be a man-modified virus without being an intentional bioweapon, if it was truly meant for research only and its release was an accident.</p>
<p>This is part of why we need a full and honest investigation of what happened and what the lab was doing. Incompetence and malice require different responses and punishments.</p>

        <p>This exactly.  </p>
<p>If they released a bioweapon they'd end up killing themselves. </p>
<p>And even if one thinks they have some secret cure to the bioweapon for themselves,  they couldn't guarantee it against mutations or whatever, going by their own rhetoric. </p>
<p>Much easier just to rename the flu and ask the dumb masses to beg for their own poison out of fear. They do this kind of stuff all the time.</p>

        <p>Sure, but what about the theory that the MSM has embraced- basically, that it's a highly deadly virus that occurred naturally in animals? I'm guessing this isn't a possibility you're open to. Were you ever, and if not, what disproved this theory to you, but hasn't disproved the hoax or bioweapon theories?

        <p>This is how they discovered "SARS-COV-2" by assembling RNA fragments from samples with multiple sources of genetic material using an algorithm.</p>
<p>&rt;RNA extracted from <strong>bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid</strong> and <strong>culture supernatants</strong> was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. Sequence reads were <strong>assembled</strong> into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) <strong>with the use of CLC Genomics software</strong>, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed.</p>

        <p>I don't think its an intentional bioweapon. I think its the result of ethically questionable gain of function research- basically making something that doesn't exist in nature to see if its possible and then develop a way to protect against it. Mix in loose safety controls and its easy to see why everyone lost their collective shit at first. Doesnt justify the year and a half of lunacy, but leaders aren't known for level headed decision making once they head down a particular road.</p>

        <p>This is something I thought about myself and I don't think these ideas are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Here's the conclusion I come to:  Based on the events of the last year and a half, a pathogen doesn't have to be much worse than a virulent strain of influenza to attain it's goal.  Look how much damage fear has caused 
our country in the last year and a half.  </p>
<p>I'd also argue that the way this was engineered and delivered gave the creator plausible deniability.  Additionally, if the pathogen was too efficient at killing, it would flame out real quick.</p>

        <p>We've been lied to so much about covid-19 from our the Government and various organizations that I feel it can be hard and confusing to know the true facts behind this scamdemic.</p>
<p>I just keep an open mind about everything, and try to formulate on my own where this ride is taking us. </p>
<p>By the way, while the virus may have been engineered with Gain-of-Function (i.e. adding something to it), it may also have been given a Loss-of-Function as well (to make it benign). When I first heard that young people and children weren't affected by covid-19, my immediate reaction was "Give me a fucking break, this sounds totally suspect and bullshit", and I felt something engineered was either released (on purpose or by accident), but then again there are those who I follow that have stated covid-19 has not been isolated, which I also factor into my thinking process. </p>
