        <p>Not one person who is pro lockdown cares about all of the other ways people die.  They just don't.  They will eat popcorn as people die from depression or treatable conditions.  Every one of the pro-lockdown people care only for themselves.  They are nothing but hypochondriacs. "Don't kill grandma" means "don't kill me".  Grandma is just a slogan to them.</p>

        <p>I literally tried to have a discussion about this very thing yesterday in my city's sub. It was about protesters outside our health department, and no one seemed to think what they did was valid.</p>
<p>So I carefully explained the position of people who are, or have loved ones with, severe mental issues as a direct result of the lockdowns. Issues which could or already have, led to suicide.</p>
<p>And in response I was downvoted into oblivion with nearly 0 reasonable responses, because of course I was...</p>

        <p>I know of:</p>
<p>2 domestic violence murders</p>
<p>5 suicides</p>
<p>(All ages 20-40)</p>
<p>2 recovered cases</p>
<p>1 covid death (had stage 4 cancer and was like 80)</p>
<p>So... 1 covid, 7 others during lockdown</p>
<p>Edit: I clarified that 1 death was a covid death.</p>

        <p>Thanks, they weren't people I was close to, but still tragic. They were some I went to school with and one my mom was friends with and one was distant family, but still sad because it was mostly preventable.</p>

        <p>Because they usually can't stand having their shit opinions challenged and are too mentally weak to defend their viewpoints( Doesn't apply to all left leaning people,just the braindead fanatics we regularly see on that side)</p>
<p>Could also stem from the fact that doomers are quick to call those skeptical of lockdown/mask shit Trump supporters even though that obviously doesn't extend to everyone</p>

        <p>The problem is everything is getting politicized.  In this case,gun control or outright banning them altogether is a popular talking point for the leftist politicians.  As for COVID ,some of the more notorious fuckups when it comes to the overreaction are Democrats. And Trump has made it clear he wants to get things back to normal as soon as possible and the more insane leftists and MSM will oppose every stance he takes,regardless of the consequences.</p>

        <p>I was reading the NY Times yesterday. I came across an article about "excess deaths" (deaths above the average). If you take total deaths for the USA in 2020 and subtract COVID deaths, there are still \~80,000 deaths (this is about 40% the size of the COVID death count) left above average. The NY Times writer was very confused and wrote "what are all these other deaths, could we be missing COVID deaths". They seem to have mentally blocked themselves off to the idea of lockdown deaths. The true number of lockdown deaths is likely a little higher, since traffic deaths should be low this year, due to lockdown.</p>
