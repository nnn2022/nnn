    <strong>Any thoughts on the new Woodward book?</strong>
    <p><p>Trump on February 7th to Bob Woodward:</p>
<p>Trump called Woodward and revealed that he thought the situation was far more dire than what he had been saying publicly.</p>
<p>“You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed,” Trump said in a Feb. 7 call. “And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flu.”</p>
<p>“This is deadly stuff,” the president repeated for emphasis.</p></p>

        <p>The tapes are a nothing burger. He’s not a medical expert. Clearly some advisors in his inner circle were doomers, and he believed them. Back in Feb if you divided the deaths by cases you got a higher IFR than the flu. Now we know that there are at least 10 undetected cases for every confirmed one, most of which are asymptomatic, making this far less deadly.</p>

<p>If he's implying that it's airborne, and only breathing in air is what transmits it, then everyone is fucked. Cloth masks, and other such restrictions are 100% security theater. In order to prevent something like this, you'd need to wear a full blown military grade mask with filters. Of course, the fact many of us are still alive and well, even after having had the virus (allegedly, anyway, given the false positive rate), I'd say it's safe to take our chance with the outside world.</p>

        <p>If that's true, then how does <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/30/822491838/coronavirus-world-map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-outbreak">Japan have only 7,400 deaths and 72.7k cases</a> despite the only measure they're taking to combat the virus is mandating masks?</p>
<p>Almost like wearing a mask does more than block particles coming in, it prevents them from coming out too.</p>

        <p>Japan only has 1377 total deaths. </p>
<p>And while people do wear masks in Japan, the masks didn't have much of an effect on case numbers. They just had a huge <a href="https://imgur.com/PaDOOk6">spike</a> in cases over the last month. Mask usage has little to no impact on the spread of the disease.</p>

        <p>Need a source on the death count, and the surge has been attributed to colleges re-opening and a general fatigue surrounding the measures put in place, such as social distancing and mask mandates.</p>
<p>Also, there are hundreds of studies on how wearing masks combats the spread of airborne diseases. Look at H1N1's infection numbers, they're much, <em>much</em> higher than COVID, largely because it was an airborne pathogen, and masks were not made commonplace.</p>

        <p>Here is Japan's <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/japan/">death count</a>. Really not very hard to find. </p>
<p>Oh, I'm sure there is no shortage of excuses as to why mask wearing hasn't worked in stopping the spread as promised. </p>
<p>There are just as many studies on how mask wearing is not effective in stopping viral spread. The science is all over the place and extremely thin. <a href="https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy">Here</a> is one article that lists a bunch of studies showing that masks are ineffective. I post this not to say that these studies are conclusive, but rather to point out that there are plenty of studies that contradict what you are claiming. There certainly is no consensus. But every time I ask people why they support masks, they always refer to some random study, that usually doesn't say what they think it says. But while studies are fine and good, at this point we have plenty of actual data from all across the world from countless places that have had mask mandates in place for months, and when you look at the results, it clearly shows that mask wearing has had little to no impact on the spread of Sars-Cov-2. I posted this somewhere else, but here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>California</strong> 
California issued a statewide mask mandate on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/18/880583357/california-gov-newsom-makes-face-masks-mandatory-amid-rising-coronavirus-cases">June 18</a>. And some places like Los Angeles County had mask mandates in effect since <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/05/l-a-county-coronavirus-update-public-health-director-says-masks-are-in-fact-mandatory-across-the-entire-county-1202935226/">May 14.</a> So you would think that cases would slow down in California, but that's not what happened. <a href="https://imgur.com/dZVhEwi">Here</a> is the daily new cases chart from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/california/">worldometers</a>. It clearly shows that mask mandates have not led to a slow in the spread of the virus. In fact, the opposite happened. As masks were mandated, cases began to rise at a more rapid rate. After the statewide mandate, cases dramatically increased for over a month until it peaked on July 25th. If masks were effective, you would expect at the least a flattening of the curve. But this did not happen. What is also interesting is that Los Angeles County accounts for nearly half of all of California's <a href="https://imgur.com/ky2V0gh">deaths</a>, and they have had a mask mandate in place since mid May. And this <a href="https://imgur.com/PNjQIHP">map</a> from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html">New York Times</a> shows that California, and the LA area are very compliant when it comes to mask wearing. Mask wearing has not been effective in California.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong> 
The same thing happened in Florida. While there is no statewide mask mandate, most of the largest cities in the state (Miami, Tampa, Orlando) implemented mask mandates by <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/06/19/major-florida-cities-now-require-use-of-face-mask-in-public-places/">June 19th.</a> Yet after the mandates, cases continued to rise for nearly a month, finally peaking on <a href="https://imgur.com/48pabWz">July 13.</a> And in similar fashion, the curve wasn't flattened at all, on the contrary, the rate of new cases increased after mask mandates were implemented. Mask wearing has not been effective in Florida.</p>
<p><strong>Texas</strong> 
Texas has a similar story. While a statewide mask mandate was issued on July 3rd, the largest cities (<a href="https://patch.com/texas/irving-tx/dallas-county-judge-issues-order-requiring-face-masks">Dallas</a>, <a href="https://houstonse.org/blog/harris-county-new-mask-order/">Houston</a>, <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=342433">Austin</a>, <a href="https://www.bexar.org/3234/COVID-19">San Antonio</a>) all implemented mask mandates around June 22. Yet after this mandate, cases continued to increase regardless, finally peaking on <a href="https://imgur.com/qUuLpYw">July 16</a>. Mask wearing has not been effective in Texas.</p>
<p>The same thing can be said for Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. All of these places implemented mask mandates, yet cases continued to increase regardless (you can check out their curves <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">here</a>. And this is not just an American thing. The same thing has been observed around the <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries">world</a>. Spain, France, Belgium, Peru, Argentina, The Philippines, and countless other nations implemented strict mask mandates, only to have cases to continue to increase. And then you have places like Scandinavia, which didn't impose masks, yet had similar results (Sweden) or better (Denmark, Norway, Finland). The point is that mask mandates have been tried through out the world, and the data we have is very clear that mask wearing had no real impact on the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>As for H1N1, the comparison is not a very good one. Never in human history has a disease been so meticulously tracked and tested for by every nation on earth in the way that Sars-Cov-2 has this year. Flu numbers from any year are rough estimates. Few people are ever tested for Influenza, even deadly pandemics like H1N1. Whereas the case numbers you are looking at for covid are lab confirmed cases. To compare these two numbers is not really comparing the same thing. And then to jump to the conclusion that H1N1 case numbers (which are estimates to begin with) were higher because people didn't wear masks is based on nothing but wishful thinking. It certainly is not backed by any actual data. And the data that we have now about masks definitely makes your theory that much more ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Its not a fucking "theory", it's proven science. Masks catch and collect water droplets propelled from your mouth, which is the way that &rt;95% of airborne pathogens spread.</p>
<p>Also, I believe I made masks sound like the "end all be all" to completely halting the spread entirely. In every case you mentioned, these mask mandates were put into effect when cases were ALREADY on the rise. When you take into account the average 14 day incubation period of the virus, and assume people got tested when they showed symptoms (and thus were added into the national numbers), the case curves show a clear change. Not a complete halt in new cases, because masks aren't perfect, but they're undeniably better than nothing.</p>
<p>Also +2, Worldometer isn't a credible source, as they only say they get their data from "World governments", with no other indications of fact checking, verification, or anything of the sort. Ill stick with NPR.</p>

        <p>It absolutely is not "proven science". What was proven? How was it proven? Who proved it? When was it proven? You making this claim doesn't make it true. No one doubts that Sars-Cov-2 is an airborne virus and spreads through droplets. Whether masks have any impact on the spread of the virus is what science has yet to prove. And thus far, the data we do have is clearly showing that masks are not effective. </p>
<p>In every case that I mentioned, cases were on the rise, and they continued to rise more rapidly after masks were mandated. If masks were effective, you would at least see a flattening of the curve, showing that the spread of the disease was slowing, but that is not what happened. Even with 14 days, cases rose for a month after mandates. There was no change in trajectory, if anything masks increased the rate of the spread. The curves contradict everything you are saying. There are so many examples that fly in the face of masks being effective. Why do you ignore the actual numbers and twist yourself into knots trying to prove that masks work? Do you work for a mask company? It makes no sense to defend a policy that has proven time and time again to not be effective. Where do you believe masks have proven to be effective? Show me some convincing evidence. </p>
<p>You are discounting worldometers? Interesting. Ok, you can just google "Japan Covid Deaths" if you want, and you'll see <a href="https://imgur.com/ZQhZGwG">this</a>. Go ahead and stick with NPR, but that number you are sharing is completely wrong. <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/6087/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-in-japan/">Here</a> is another place you can find Japan's numbers. Or you can go to <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/japan">Johns Hopkins</a> and see for yourself. Bottom line, is you are wrong. It's pretty obvious that you haven't ever looked through the data yourself and are basing your opinion on incorrect NPR articles.</p>

        <p>Alright I'll eat the L on Japans numbers, clearly NPR needs to get their shit together on that one. Though my distrust for Worldometer stands, since they're largely just a privately run website and nothing more. Additionally, this discrepancy doesn't completely disprove that masks don't work, and if anything is an argument that masks can save lives.</p>
<p>As for masks not being effective. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/amp/face-mask-visualization-droplets-covid-19.html">Here is a video showing how far water droplets travel with and without a mask</a>. After doing some further digging, I started to realize where the misconception that "masks don't work" comes from, and that is from studies  asking if N95 respirators/Surgical masks were effective in preventing the <em>user</em> from contracting an airborne pathogen. A vast majority of these studies (which you can easily find on Google scholar) were primarily looking at if masks were effective at stopping an airborne pathogen from entering a person's lungs and resulting in a laboratory-positive test.</p>
<p>The resounding answer is no, which isn't much of a surprise to me. Virus particles are much smaller than the gaps in the fabric of a mask, and can easily slip through. However, the studies that I'm talking about didn't take into consideration the other way around, where the sick person is the one wearing the mask. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=10&amp;q=surgical+mask+effectiveness&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,10#d=gs_qabs&amp;u=%23p%3DUAPsCapYPrkJ">This one here from 1993 found that bacterial colonies were much less frequent in a surgical setting when the surgeon/assistants were wearing masks.</a> Admittedly bacteria are MUCH larger than viruses, but other studies examining bacterial spread with masks found the masks were still ineffective if only worn by healthy people. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=10&amp;q=surgical+mask+effectiveness&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,10#d=gs_qabs&amp;u=%23p%3D8GmWpQHduu8J">This one uses a mathematical model to determine what would've been different with H1N1 if only 10% of the population wore an N95 mask</a> and found cases couldve been reduced by as much as 20%.</p>
<p>It is proven. Masks work, just not in the way we thought they did. Wearing a mask doesn't prevent <strong><em>you</em></strong> from getting sick, it prevents you from getting <strong><em>others</em></strong> sick.</p>

        <p>But that's the problem, the actual numbers do not support this idea. Wearing masks has not been "proven" to prevent others from getting sick. I get the idea behind it. And a few months ago, there was enough justification to try using masks to slow the spread. But now, months in, the numbers speak for themselves. People wearing masks in California did not prevent others from getting sick. People got sick regardless of the masks. Masks did not prevent or slow the spread of Sars-Cov-2 at all. The same conclusion can be made for just about every state where mask mandates were implemented (Florida, Texas, Illinois, Michigan, Hawaii, Virginia, Maryland, etc). And this applies to countless nations around the world as well (Spain, France, Peru, Belgium, Argentina,The Philippines, etc). And then the places like the Scandinavian nations, which had no mask mandates, yet ended up with equal to better results as those nations that imposed mask mandates. The notion that masks being effective at slowing the spread of this virus is simply not supported by data. The best you have shown me is a 1993 study about masks stopping bacterial spread in surgical settings, which is not relevant to viral spread throughout communities. And a mathematical model talking about N95 masks and their theoretical impact on the spread of H1N1. Neither of these studies have much to do with what we are even talking about. But regardless, real world data trumps studies every time. The results are very clear that mask wearing has little to no impact on the spread of Sars-Cov-2. Where is a clear example of masks preventing the spread of this disease?</p>

        <p>Its all around you. Florida no longer has a mask mandate in effect, and their cases have spiked 900% since the mandate was lifted. The issue is, you simply can't prove that, in this particular case, masks will 100% help, because there is no control group. You can't have a control group. It's real life, and the numbers are going to go up one way or another. It's not about completely stopping the spread (a feat that would cost billions of dollars, if possible at all), it's about slowing it. If you'd get that through your dense head and stop refusing countless studies im throwing at you with hundreds more and several meta-analyses backing them up, you'd see that masks slow the spread of a disease by limiting the number of people who get sick from the virus.</p>
<p>Going back to Japan's death rate of 1300 dead to 70k sick. Do you know why that is? Because their healthcare system was never overloaded by massive waves of new infected. They've slowed the spread by effective use of masks and social distancing, those policies are slipping now, and the daily cases are climbing. The correlation is clear, and in two years when the studies are all written and published, causation can, and will, be established. Oh and also, H1N1 is hardly different. The methods of transmission are the same, and the R factor of both are relatively the same (Hovering around 1.28 on average).</p>
<p>Im done arguing with you because you see the facts, accept them, and then continue to make the same selfish fucking arguments all because it's too much of a hassle to wear a piece of cloth on your face while you're in a store for 15 minutes. Go back to Facebook, nobody wants you here.</p>

        <p>Florida? Why are you making things up? <a href="https://imgur.com/48pabWz">Here</a> is a graph of Florida's cases. Florida has never had a statewide mandate, but all the largest cities imposed mask mandates on <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/06/19/major-florida-cities-now-require-use-of-face-mask-in-public-places/">June 19th.</a>. For the next month, after masks were mandated is when cases spiked, peaking on July 13th. You really have no idea what you are talking about. Why make up statistics like that? </p>
<p>You are the one ignoring the actual data. I looked at the studies you shared with me. They are irrelevant to the conversation. Did you even read the studies you shared? Doesn't seem like it. I do not deny that there are studies that show masks can be effective. You have not shared any of them, and I am very confident you have never actually read one. But there are just as many studies and meta-analyses that show that they don't work, <a href="https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy">here</a> are some you should look at. We can throw studies at each other all day, but in the end, the actual data from the real world implementation of mask mandates throughout the world is very clear at this point, and it shows that masks have little to no impact on the spread of the disease. You have decided to ignore the actual data and rely on studies you have never read, and wouldn't understand even if you had read them. </p>
<p>All we have seen in Japan is that widespread mask wearing did not lead to a reduction in the spread of the disease. It spread and spiked regardless of mask wearing. It is baffling that you still cling to this notion that masks are effective, despite all the evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>The point about H1N1 isn't that they are not similar, they are similar. The point is that the way in which they have been tracked and tested for are wildly different, which makes comparisons not helpful. </p>
<p>And the fact that you think that I oppose mask wearing just because I am selfish and find it too much of a hassle tells me all I need to know about your ability to rationally think and understand people that have differing viewpoints. I hope you change.</p>

        <p>You're just an insane person who refuses to acknowledge that trends in cases continue after masks are mandated because they're not a magical "fix all" to everything. Im not gonna change, because real fucking scientists tell me to wear a mask, so I'm gonna wear a mask.</p>
<p>You're part of the reason that the U.S has well over 6 Million cases. Fuck you. Simply put, fuck you.</p>

        <p>So masks are effective, yet they don't slow the spread of the disease at all? Nearly every place where masks have been mandated the actual data shows that wearing them did nothing to reduce case numbers. No one thinks they are a "fix all", but you'd think they would fix something, but they have been shown not to fix anything. Yet you continue to advocate for their use. In reality, you are the one attributing magical properties to masks. At this point there is no logical reason to continue promoting masks as a way to slow the spread of the disease. The data does not support it. But you keep clinging to masks, and your only rationale is that some vague "scientists" told you to. You have chosen to ignore facts and reality and blindly trust "scientists". You really have turned off your brain. There are plenty of scientists and health organizations that don't recommend masks (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-netherlands-idUSKCN24U2UJ">Netherlands</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/07/29/no-point-in-wearing-mask-sweden-covid/">Sweden</a>, <a href="https://www.thelocal.no/20200508/why-is-norway-not-recommending-face-masks-for-the-public">Norway</a>). But you seem to think that because I actually follow the data and listen to actual scientists, I am somehow responsible for a virus spreading. Good grief, listen to yourself. You have proven to be misinformed and ignorant to what science actually says. And as should be expected, you ended up resorting to personal attacks and profanity, because your arguments are not supported by data or reality.</p>

        <p>When did I say they don't slow the spread at all? You have no basis to claim that without the mask mandates those cities would've experienced the same infection rates. Look at New York's numbers, and then compare them to the numbers after April 15th, the first day of their mask mandate. Look at Los Angeles after their June 18th. You can see that the acceleration of new cases during the spike slows almost immediately. </p>
<p>You don't look at a car crash 5 minutes after it happened and say  "Why would they have the airbags deploy? The seat belts were clearly enough, they're fine.". So why look at pandemic numbers after the fact and go "Well clearly those didn't work, our cases per day didn't drop to zero!"?</p>
<p>In the first article you linked, the Dutch cited improper use of masks to be the reason they were not mandating it. They even explicitly state that there can be benefits to mask mandates.</p>
<p>&rt;RIVM chief Jaap van Dissel said that the organization was aware of studies that show masks help slow the spread of disease but it was not convinced they will help during the current coronavirus outbreak in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Keyword there is "In the Netherlands". An incredibly small country who has a declining daily cases rate and cooperative citizens.. In addition, the article <em>also</em> mentions that masks are being mandated on public transport and airports already, and those mandates weren't going away.</p>
<p>As for Sweden, same story. Their critical covid case rate is nearing 0, cases are dropping every day, and with fewer people to spread it and most of those people seeking treatment, there are very few infected persons wandering around on the streets.</p>
<p>Same for Norway. Cases are already decreasing, not many people are around to spread it, we don't need this anymore. They're re-evaluating the effectiveness of masks as we speak, but theyre largely targeting the effectiveness of mask <em>mandates</em>, since they're mainly looking at misuse of masks and low quality masks and how they undermine the effectiveness of it all.</p>
<p>Youre just wrong. Plain and simple.</p>

        <p>You didn't say they don't slow the spread at all. The data shows that, you just choose to ignore it.</p>
<p>You are misinformed about New York. New York's cases peaked on <a href="https://imgur.com/PtrMq9K">April 10th</a>. New York's mask mandate went into effect on <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-issues-executive-order-requiring-all-people-new">April 17th</a>. If you look at the <a href="https://imgur.com/PtrMq9K">graph</a>, cases were already declining on their own, without a mask mandate for a week. If anything, after masks were mandated, there was a small uptick in cases. New York proves my point, not yours. New York's cases declined without mask mandates. If masks were effective, the rate of decrease would be more rapid. This did not happen. New York's mask mandate had no effect on the spread of the disease. </p>
<p>As expected, you are also misinformed about Los Angeles. While California enacted a statewide mask mandate on Jun 18th, Los Angeles, implemented a mask mandate on <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/05/l-a-county-coronavirus-update-public-health-director-says-masks-are-in-fact-mandatory-across-the-entire-county-1202935226/">May 14th</a>. Yet when you look at the <a href="https://imgur.com/dZVhEwi">numbers</a>, you see that after LA implemented mask mandates, cases continued rising at the same rate with no change in trajectory. Then when the statewide mandate was enacted, cases skyrocketed for the next month. Again, California proves my point, not yours. Masks had no effect on either New York or California. </p>
<p>You keep clinging to this idea that masks work, when the data clearly shows that they don't. Then you bring up examples that support my argument. It's kinda funny. The point with the Scandinavian countries is that they never needed to mandate masks, and their cases dropped regardless. The evidence against your argument is so clear, but you seem to be religiously tied to masks being effective. I get that you have faith in "experts", though you probably couldn't name one "expert" besides Anthony Fauci. I get that you are all in on masks. But it's ok to reevaluate your opinions. It's ok that you were wrong about masks.</p>
