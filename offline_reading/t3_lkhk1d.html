<title>COVID-19 is apparently more contagious than influenza or the common cold, and it's constantly said how effective social distancing and masks are, but I've had a cold twice in the last 12 months. I'm curious about the rest of you, so I made this poll.</title>

        <p>I work in an office and people have been snotting and coughing up their lungs for a year. None of it even suspected as rona. My kid tested negative for rona with cold symptoms ( he gave me that cold) and he has to wear a mask more than I do. He later tested positive for rona, but none of the rest of us got it from him. We didn't make him "mask up" or social distance in his own home even though i told the contact tracer we were.</p>

        <p>I clicked I had covid, because that's what the serology says. Meaning I have detectable antibodies. But to clarify, I was never sick since the beginning of the pandemic thing started. And since I live in Italy where you can get fined between 400 and 1000 euros for not wearing a mask, I do wear the damn thing whenever I can't avoid bumping into people. Enough said, me thinks</p>

        <p>I haven't had COVID, but I've had two colds since this whole thing started and I wear a mask as I am not allowed in stores without one. I think it's interesting that the things I've done to avoid COVID still didn't prevent me from getting a cold, which is less contagious than COVID.</p>

        <p>I’ve traveled to 6 states, been to get togethers and my grandmothers funeral in another state. Went to Disney World twice, rented a cabin with friends and family up north, etc. </p>
<p>I do not wear a mask (except at Disney and I was very loose with it) and I haven’t even had a cold once. Tons of people at my daughters sport had Covid, at least 10 of my husbands co workers or spouses had it. Our best friends daughter had it, etc. Every single one of them is fine. The mask wearers in that bunch definitely hyped up their sickness when in reality they were out for a couple days like any sickness. Then they pushed mask wearing (cuz it really worked, eh). </p>
<p>Nobody in my immediate family has gotten it. Not my kid at college, not my military husband, not me, nope.</p>

        <p>Last 3 years (til the end of 2019)... I got a very hard flu every year which floored me for a week.</p>
<p>It was odd for me because I'm pretty much never sick. I would get the flu or a cold one time in the winter, which would last 2 or 3 days top. So these last years were new to me because it hit me a lot harder and longer.</p>
<p>This year though... I got nothing. Winter 2020 through today. Nothing. I've been fine since October 2019.</p>
<p>Maybe the measures are part of it, but I'd like to add that I started practicing the Wim Hoff method last August. Been doing the breathing and the cold showers since then. I'm pretty convince it is a big contributor to me not getting sick this winter.</p>

        <p>I haven't been sick since wearing a mask/washing my hands multiple times a day, and using hand sanitizer regularly, I must admit. But I've also tested positive for covid multiple times with little or no symptoms. I work in food service so alot of this is company required, but I do think it's kinda a silver lining. I don't like it, but I can't exactly argue with the noticable results.</p>
<p>Recently I've been told that you can falsely test positive for covid for "up to three months or more"(so for the rest of your life?) after having covid. That's according to the CDC, so it's like how accurate is a test that it can't tell the difference between an asymptomatic infectious patient and a post recovered noninfectious patient? </p>
<p>Either way, I'd be ok wearing a mask in public for the rest of my life, even if other's didn't. I don't really care for the idea of breathing the same unfiltered air anymore as the common masses. And let's be realistic, this is the third viral epidemic that's come from china in the last decade. Covid19 isn't as bad as the media has made it out to be, but Covid19 is the calm before the storm.</p>

        <p>I'm fine with wearing a mask, but the fearmongering of the virus is getting out of hand. I want the stupid goddamn one way arrows to stop (most people ignore them anyway, but it just makes me feel like an ass if I don't follow them), and I want the limit to how many people are allowed in an area to stop. I want concerts, and sports, and parties back without getting a fine.</p>

        <p>I do too, this dystopia really sucks, nobody enjoys having to do any of this, but I really do believe that sometimes the only way out is through. I think the media needs to stop making this a sensationalized story and start taking it seriously. No need to feel like an ass if you don't follow some arrow sticker on the floor, it's more of a suggestion for health safety. Follow it if possible, but if not, whatever, so long as you're wearing a mask and generally staying a couple meters away then your fine.</p>

        <p>You have the right to wear a mask, if you feel it is in your best interest. </p>

        <p>I agree, but doesn't it gross you out that random people are kinda spitting in your mouth? Not judging, I mean if you're into that sort of thing that's cool. I just don't like the idea of breathing in small water droplets that came from other people's bodies, laden with viruses or no. At least without my consent.</p>

        <p>Ya know, you don't HAVE to be an asshole. Has anyone ever told you that? You actively choose to be one, and It kinda makes your points fall by the wayside. Not to even mention you don't have the balls to say that on your main account.</p>

        <p>I have young children, I get mildly ill with some bug or other a few times a year. This year has been less often at I would say two colds. It's impossible for me to know whether one of those colds was actually the Wuhan coronavirus, or if maybe I had it another time without any symptoms whatsoever.</p>
<p>As an aside, I am a bit concerned about my youngest children and their relative lack of exposure to viruses and bacteria. It can't be good for the development of their immune systems.</p>

        <p>I haven't been sick in well over 12 months, share and smoke bongs with multiple people everyday. Haven't worn a mask once, only wash my hands when there's shit on them. have had people over everyday, some from other states. Never social distanced once and I even got into a threesome last year during the peak of the scamdemic. 
I'm an antivaxxer, and if you tell me to wear a mask I will spit on you.</p>
