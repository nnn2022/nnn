    <strong>Unvaccinated populations do NOT cause variants. Here’s why.</strong>
    <p><p>Not only is the narrative that the unvaccinated are the cause of variants categorically false, but it is dangerous as well. Covid-19 is not an alien virus, it still operates within the confines of planet earth. Unvaccinated populations are not the cause of variants. </p>
<p>Unvaccinated populations would not put evolutionary pressure on a virus to mutate. That makes no sense. A virus has one goal. To survive, it survives by spreading. It would have no incentive to mutate if it was spreading within a population that has not contracted the virus. Viruses change because they have evolutionary pressure to do so. There are two things that put evolutionary pressure on viruses.</p>
<ol>
<li>It has run through a population and is encountering hosts that have antibodies. </li>
<li>There is a vaccine that is providing synthetic antibodies. (Variants occur when a vaccine is not 100% effective.) </li>
</ol>
<p>Viruses aren’t sociopathic masterminds, they don’t waste energy and efficacy forming variants unless they must. When a virus mutates it weakens. There are different ways a virus can weaken. It can become less lethal, (typically, the more communicable a virus, the less lethal it is) or it can become more lethal. If it loses lethality, it can spread faster and find more hosts, but will have to continually change. This is essentially how the common cold and flu viruses operate. If it becomes more lethal, it will burn through a population slower by sacrificing ease of transmission. This is how viruses with high mortality rates, like Ebola, burn out and come back again. <strong>It is exceedingly rare for a virus to be both highly lethal and highly communicable.</strong> If this was the case with Covid-19, you would know it, I would know it, there would be bodies everywhere. You wouldn’t need a faulty PCR test to tell you. There would be a complete breakdown of society. I’m not talking flatten the curve, I’m talking catastrophe. These fools out here freaking out about a 1.8% (in the US, per Johns Hopkins) mortality rate have no idea what bad is. Just reminding you of what you already know, you aren’t the problem. They are. </p>
<p>TLDR; Unvaccinated populations don’t put evolutionary pressure on viruses. Ineffective vaccines and populations that have already contracted the virus do.</p></p>

        <p>I'd debate some of the finer details in your post, but I'd agree with your TL:DR</p>
<p>In evolution, we term this phenomenom a "selective pressure" - I remember learning about it at school. The "mutant" that is better suited to survive in its environment, survives to reproduce because it out-competes its fellow "non-mutants".</p>

        <p>I think when covid first hit it was pretty lethal, but as it spread it sacrificed lethality for easier transmission. My apologies if I’m using these terms incorrectly, it’s been a minute since I was in microbiology. If they ever decide to unleash smallpox we are fucked.</p>

        <p>I loved during the early pandemic when the research was saying that smokers were at less risk than non smokers. I was laughing/coughing so hard.</p>
<p>A respiratory illness that impacts smokers less. Once I saw that I knew it was bs. It was just impacting 80-90 year olds, and the majority of those people who would’ve smoked were dead by that age. </p>
<p>Simple common sense to shift through the bs</p>

        <p>Evolutionary pressure doesn't cause viruses to mutate; it only determines which mutations survive. Mutations are nothing more than errors in the cloning process that viruses use to reproduce. Mutations are going to happen even in the absence of any evolutionary pressure.  </p>
<p>The reason that the unvaccinated facilitate (cause is exactly the wrong word too) mutations is because they have longer illnesses. Longer illnesses means more opportunities to clone and thus more opportunities to mutate. It's a degree thing, not a cause and effect thing. Even vaccinated people can be the source of viral mutations, just to a lesser degree.</p>

        <p>Should also point out that vaxxed/unvaxxed has nothing to do with it. Severity of infection is what increases the chance that the virus will mutate. So basically immunocompromised and obese people are the "variant factories" not the unvaxxed. I would argue that a fully vaxxed but unhealthy person would be sicker for longer when compared to a healthy, young person who's unvaxxed.</p>
<p>What the OP said regarding leaky vaccines and selective pressure is true though. If we had a 100% effective vaccine and 100% vaccination uptake then the virus would re-emerge after mutating outside of the current vaccine coverage.</p>

<p><strong>Nothing</strong> increases or decreases the chance a virus will mutate. It is an autonomic process that occurs irrespective of any environmental condition.</p>

        <p>OK! Now we are working from the same starting point. There is a case to be made that vaccines, especially "leaky" ones, do in fact serve as selective pressure on viral adaptation. It's an interesting subject and one that honestly has not been studied thoroughly in the literature. </p>
<p>I am agnostic/open minded on this particular argument. We don't know enough to fully understand the cost/benefit tradeoff of various strategies, especially working on a mass scale of billions of people. Even assuming that to be true, however, it doesn't follow that the present focus on targeting the unvaccinated is wrong. Something has to be done and this is as reasonable a strategy as anything else.</p>

        <p>A much more reasonable strategy would be to offer vaccines to those most at risk of death from covid whilst letting the rest of population gain herd immunity through previous infection. 
No more lockdowns basically.</p>

        <p>&rt;Viruses change because they have evolutionary pressure to do so.</p>
<p>No, viruses change because of random mutations that turn out to be advantageous. People hosting COVID-19 provide millions of opportunities for a virus to randomly mutate. Vaccination helps you stamp out the virus quickly before it has a chance to mutate.</p>
<p>Of course vaccinated people with local SARS-CoV-2 infections can be hosts for mutations- but the chances of it are far, far lower than somebody with full blown COVID-19 (regardless of vaccination status).</p>
