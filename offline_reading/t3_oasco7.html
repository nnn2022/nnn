        <p>That P.O.S. disappeared just in time, didn't he?  <em>What a coincidence.</em></p>
<p>By the way... PR like he got with the divorce doesn't just happen. Believe it or not, he's not interesting enough for the news to obsess over like that for free.</p>
<p>That was a negative PR campaign... And I believe he financed it himself. To look like he was 'out of commission' and no longer in the limelight.</p>
<p>On the surface he appears to have tucked his tail between his adulterous legs and went into hiding... But really he's just out of the picture while the protests happen and the side effects become known.</p>
<p>His objective is accomplished. He got "shots in arms" and that was always the goal. According to the SPARS Pandemic Scenario published in 2017 ( <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/Center-projects/completed-projects/spars-pandemic-scenario.html">https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/Center-projects/completed-projects/spars-pandemic-scenario.html</a> ) the next step is for the side effects to become well known... And eventually the president will apologize to the country and thank the people who took the experimental vaccines for their bravery and patriotism during a time of crisis.</p>
<p>Eventually after we all accept the "accidental" side effects and long term damage done to people by these vaccines, he'll return to the limelight with a new PR campaign...</p>
<p>He'll end up just like George W. Bush Jr., who was hated for a period of time for tricking the nation into going into an unnecessary war in Iraq that killed hundreds of thousands of people... All because they supposedly had "weapons of mass destruction" and attack from Iraq was "an imminent threat."</p>
<p>There were no weapons of mass destruction... And the people have forgotten. Their memory only goes back to the last thing they're shown on their screens, and that was "George W. Bush Jr. is a guy you'd want to have a beer with."</p>
<p>So you can expect Bill Gates to be similarly reinvented at some point after this all blows over... And the people will eat it up, just like they accepted the business closures, the lockdowns, the curfews, the social distancing, the masks, and took the vaccines.</p>

        <p>You're right that people forget, and they also don't give a shit if they're proven wrong. I was a huge anti-Iraq war person back in the day. I lost a lot of friends I'd had in high school over this. Because I "didn't support America", didn't "support the troops" and didn't support "stopping WMDs." </p>
<p>I'll never forget one guy telling me I deserved to be hung for "going against America." </p>
<p>This is why when people talk about how crazy and divided we are today, I'm like eh... it has been this way for a long time. I think people just forget how nasty people were to each other back in the George W. years. There were vicious, horrible fights between a lot of people I knew about politics back then. It wasn't quite as intense as it was during the Trump years, but people have always been complete sheep for the mainstream media and hateful toward anyone who doesn't think like them.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point of this story is when it came out there were no WMDs, none of these people apologized to me. They'd all just moved on. They didn't give a shit that they were wrong or that they'd treated others like crap over their stupid beliefs. If we get proven right about this vaccine and all this other stuff, it's going to be the same.</p>

        <p>Yeah! Also interesting is how the ropes kind of flipped. Now it's the Democrats that are pushing this nightmare agenda, but the Republicans that think Trump was there to save them are just as lost.</p>
<p>When I realize it's a small number of people that know both parties are against us, I'm reminded of how hopeless the situation is.</p>
<p>I'll be right there with someone as they rail against Biden and the Democrats. Yeah! Yeah! Right on! And then they'll say, "If only Trump was still in office." And I realize that person doesn't actually have a clue about the bigger picture.</p>

        <p>Yup, Democrat and Republican are now just two wings of the same bird. I think more and more people are slowly starting to realize this.<br>
Voted for Trump myself, but kinda hope be doesn't run again, just because it seems so many people think he's some kind of savior or end all be all</p>

        <p>Oh please, Trump &amp; his supporters know all about the Uniparty GOP. We had to defeat them in the primaries before going up against HRC. We saw them stab us in the back again during the 2020... The only thing we can count on is Trump not being "them"</p>

        <p>You're right, they'll forget... But we won't. They pulled off a massive attack in 2020 on two fronts; and useful idiots will always be useful idiots. However many of us who were tricked into apathy about politics growing up are now paying very close attention. They won the battle yeah, but they also woke up Voltron. And he's pissed.</p>

        <p>No. Just no. There's so much to unpack in those statements:</p>
<p>Bush Sr. &amp; Cheney were not "calling the shots" in Jr's presidency, and Bush Sr. didn't call the shots in his own. The office of president is a sort of <em>figurehead</em> position. There's an entire administration around them, and that administration carries out the recommendations (orders) of certain thinktanks which are funded by corporations and concentrated wealth.</p>
<p>The President, like most political positions, is more like a salesman position. His job is to sell an agenda to the American people with the power of his words, his image, his charisma. But... He doesn't set the agenda.</p>
<p>He's CREDITED with the agenda, so that when The People finally realize they were swindled -- they just replace the figurehead. The real power, behind the scenes, rarely changes.</p>
<p>And that's how we go for decades swapping power between Democrats and Republicans and yet we somehow end up going down the same direction of more debt, greater wealth inequality, increased surveillance, and growing authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Finally, George W. Bush Jr. isn't a "doofus." You don't rise to the top of national power by being doofus. That's just a nice-guy act that a lot of these people do in order to be likable.</p>
<p>In truth, he's calculated and cunning... And intelligent enough to make the right connections in order to have been President of the United State.</p>
<p>Sure, he had help. But a lot of people get help and never rise to accomplish anything. In fact, most of us work our entire lives away to make THOSE people incredibly wealthy... While calling them dumb, idiots, incompetent, or doofuses.</p>
<p>It's almost like a cow on a farm telling the other cows that the rancher is a moron. But... They're the meat.</p>
<p>These people have a parasitic relationship to us... And there are FAR more of us than them... And yet -- we never overthrow them, and we fall for the same tricks year after year, decade after decade.</p>
<p>When you look at it that way, I'm not sure who the doofuses are but it's certainly not the people in power.</p>

        <p>Well not only did he encourage others to take an experimental vaccine but also funded it himself. He didn’t push for the adverse reactions to be known. It’s like a half truth thing and telling only half the truth to anyone is not okay.</p>

        <p>Should anyone who tells half-truths about covid and covid vaccines be arrested? Is it just people who underplay vaccine risks, or people who underplay the risks of covid itself?</p>
<p>As far as funding goes, my understanding is that the Gates Foundation donated money to other organizations that manufactured and distributed vaccines.  Should people be arrested for charitable donations?</p>

        <p>We’re not talking about the average person who shares the things they think they know about the vaccine. Bill here has emerged as one of the leading forces in the global fight against infectious disease <em>cough cough</em> COVID.</p>
<p>In any event, the Gates’s efforts in the realm of disease response clearly prepared them for the current moment, they saw something most of us did not. In 2015, Bill Gates held a Ted Talk in which he heralded a future pandemic for which, at the time, we were not prepared. Considering the daily news surrounding COVID-19, we never closed that gap.</p>
