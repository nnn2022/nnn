        <p>Well, my neighbors have reported me (and a few others) several times for various offenses regarding not social distancing and whatnot.</p>
<p>Edit: I am receiving a lot of comments and messages expressing shock that PA would even have a "snitch line". I can assure you, <a href="https://coalregioncanary.com/2020/04/24/pa-opens-a-coronavirus-snitch-line-for-social-distance-warriors/">PA does have one</a>, and people do use it. The snitch lines for PA and for NY have both been brigaded by trolls as well, and I can provide links if people need further proof.</p>

        <p>Damn. That is infuriating. The fact that just living your life how you see fit and weighing the risks on your own is seen as wrong now and dare I say borderline illegal is truly insane. This is one of the reasons why places like Georgia and other states that didn't succumb to this are the only silver linings of hope here.</p>

        <p>Not wearing a mask while walking, having a friend over, they used the Pennsylvania "snitch line"/website to report me to the township wherein I got written up and visited by a town official, and so on.

        <p>Huh. I guess I don't go out enough to get snitched on.  I live in a mildly affluent area of PA (north of Philly) and we certainly have our share of busybodies.   I didn't even know PA <em>had</em> a snitch line. Jayzus.  Our township is tiny and from what I can tell the code officer hid out at home for two months.  I guess they'd send the police instead.</p>
<p>My wife has been doing most of the shopping, but I did go to the supermarket a month ago. I was almost done when a manager walked up and offered me a mask. I thanked him, then vaguely pointed at my chest saying "I have a medical condition", and he left me alone immediately. He had mumbled something about "making other customers uncomfortable" so someone must have snitched on me at the service desk.  The person at the checkout didn't seem worried about my lack of mask. Perhaps they think the 2'x2' square of plexiglass protects them, or they're just not saying anything to 'idiot' customers like me.</p>
<p>My wife and I took a walk at the big state park near us this past weekend.  I'd say 3/4 were not wearing masks, which is sensible since we were all out in the sun and fresh air, and exercising.  Later that day I stopped by the health food store which has been really suffering for lack of customers. The woman at the register saw that I didn't have a mask and immediately asked "can I help you?" but I sailed by, cheerily saying "Just here for chocolate!" (I really was craving dark chocolate and they were the closest source.) I put my chocolate on the counter, paid, and left.  Normally I browse the store and end up buying more than I really need, but I felt the need to get my chocolate and go.</p>

<p>Well, the public official was given pictures and several complaints about me (and my spouse). I was really creeped out by the fact they were taking pics of us, actually. I spoke to the official, and he mostly backed off because "I seemed nice", and I haven't seen him again since.</p>

        <p>Your neighbors?? I feel like my Neighborhood is so chill about the social distancing.  No one cares at all. People are all walking together and going to each other’s houses (I live in a primarily Indian neighborhood).  Also what state has made it a law that you need to wear masks? I thought the states just had guidelines.  Didn’t know that any of them passed an actual law?</p>

        <p>Yikes.  What happened?  Did the police show up?</p>
<p>I had an outdoor gathering two weekends ago with 15 people.  It was legal (I think my state at the time allowed up to 25), but I was worried the whole time that someone would call the cops because I live around Karens who still act like it's March and haven't realized regulations have changed.</p>

        <p>In my case, due to the snitch site/line, I received several notifications on my doorstep, a notarized letter, and an official from the township came to my door. The times the cops came, it was because the neighbors called them on me.</p>

        <p>I think these people are probably everywhere, but society keeps a lot of them in check. Not all of them, but a lot of them. The wife works at the hospital in a small town. She went to pick up Subway sandwiches for her department. Got in, paid, picked up sandwiches, left. When she got back someone had called the hospital and complained to the CEO that they just saw a healthcare worker in public with no mask. And named her to him. So yeah, these pussies are everywhere but they don't dare confront you. This asshole says he has approached them about it before, but that's a lie. That's just to keep someone on his precious reddit post from saying "why don't you go say something to them?" Truth is, this pussy will barely look up from his iPhone.</p>

        <p>A month back I went to the supermarket and out of maybe 80 people there, I was the only one without a mask.  No one said a word to me, but a manager came up to me when I was almost done, offering me a mask. He mumbled something about "making other customers uncomfortable" so obviously someone snitched.</p>

        <p>Society in London seems to encourage it to be honest so I disagree with that but you are absolutely right that this person did not confront them before.</p>
<p>I honestly thought someone would say something to me the past two days but people just stare when they think I don't notice and take pics and probably make OP style posts. These people are not the sort of people to confront anyone about anything. I'm that sort of person, and I'm not wearing a fucking mask.</p>

        <p>This honestly scares me it really does. Now society can dictate what you can't and can do and report you for not "obeying". When did we as a society get to the point where we snitch on other people over a virus that is far from a death sentence. This along with the covid notification thing on phones (which is unethical in itself considering that its automatically installed without your knowledge).</p>

        <p>Day 3 of Mandatory mask on public transport in London. </p>
<p>Monday I just wore a mask because I wasn't feeling up to dealing with assholes but today and yesterday I didn't put my mask on once. I normally see about two people also not wearing one but the vast majority are obeying. </p>
<p>The thing is with London is that evreyone is a fucking pussy and nobody dares say anything to anyone. I'm sure I've instigated some social media posts and probably had some creepshots taken of me but I even walked past police earlier and they didn't say anything. </p>
<p>Thank you to my fellow disobeyers. I probably would have pussied out if it wasn't for you.</p>
<p>I'm also just going to leave this here: most of my comrades are Indian looking?? Are there any UK South Asians here who can explain why you are so based when it comes to stupid rules? Or is it just that your beards are too great to cover? I  can respect that too.</p>

        <p>I don't think they can enforce the mask on the transport if wearing one would cause you 'severe anxiety'. </p>
<p>I wouldn't normally play that card, but honestly fuck these people. Masks should be voluntary not compulsory.</p>
<p>I keep hearing 'but what if you infect others? You don't have that right.' Well, nobody has the right to endanger another's life on the roads, but we haven't banned driving because we accept the risk and take reasonable steps to manage it e.g. having speed limits, bit not outright insisting everyone stop driving and walk.</p>

        <p>I couldn't put a percentage on it, but I certainly know or have encountered plenty of people like that. Masks and protesting (but not necessarily at the same time lol) have become the gold standards of virtue signaling.</p>
<p>My daughter recently had a lame parking lot graduation and the principal was completely open about her terror that a non-mask, non social distance photo of the event might end up on instagram and make the school 'look bad.'</p>
<p>Meanwhile a few miles away tens of thousands were packed together protesting.</p>
<p>Add to that there are plenty of otherwise rational people still terrified of the virus. So panic and virtue signaling are making policy decisions.</p>

        <p>The other day, a lady in my community posted a question to us: there is a new family who just moved in, and they have a 12 year old son who rides his dirt bike up and down the street. How can she get them all arrested? The dirty bike sound is annoying her. People were evenly split on this one. Masks are just another catalyst for assholes. They’ll find a way.</p>

        <p>Not nearly so bad as your example, but my mother-in-law is so gung-ho about masks (which she reuses without washing or disposing of, and pulls under her nose frequently to chitchat with people in the grocery store while giving them great big hugs) that she keeps nagging me and my husband to wear earloop masks like her instead of the bandanas we prefer. Last week, she forgot to wear a mask to the store, and my husband was so proud of her until she got upset no one reminded her to wear a mask. Also spends $5 to $10 each on masks that represent her favorite sports teams, nevermind our household income being less than $10,000 a year. Her younger sister is big on the WHO elbow bump, or at least she was a few months ago, and disinfected her fence because I touched it after touching my face. She won't deny that the virus is quite mild for the vast majority of people, but the fact that "it's everywhere" really scares her. The flu doesn't scare her even though it's everywhere. Both mother-in-law and her sister also wear rubber gloves to the grocery store, often reusing the same pair and otherwise using them incorrectly just like the masks.</p>

        <p>&rt; the fact that "it's everywhere" really scares her.</p>
<p>Nobody knows how viruses work, though everyone <em>thinks</em> they do.  Every virus is "everywhere" and you can't hide from them in your house, or filter them out with anything short of serious respirator headgear used in biological labs, which costs thousands of dollars. And even then you'd have to take it off sometime.  Cloth won't stop them, cheap paper masks won't stop them, they can still land in your eyes... </p>
<p>But none of that is a reason to be terrified.  Mammal immune systems have evolved over millions of years. They're not perfect of course, people still get sick and die.  But eating healthy and getting plenty of sun to up your Vitamin D levels goes a long way. Also, sadly, not having other medical conditions you may have no control over. But maintaining good health and strong vitamin D serum levels goes a very long way.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, I know people who act like this , but most will make a public scene -- loudly -- at non-mask wearers because police here would only variably warn people. And then they post all about it on social media and everyone cheers them on. People express violence towards non-mask wearers, and you can't go into a store without a mask by law.   </p>

        <p>A guy I went to college with bragged on IG how he made these “information packs’ that contain research that says mask wearing is super effective, and how he takes them everywhere and if anyone says anything to him about wearing a mask (he lives outside Seattle, so I’m surprised people are doing that there but w/e), he first confronts them by saying ‘oh so you know more than researchers and doctors?” And hands them a bag of this info and usually calls them an asshole for not caring about others as he leaves.

        <p>Luckily I don't know anyone that has snitched or been snitched on. I even had a birthday brunch for a family member at the end of May - about 20 people were in my backyard (and going into the kitchen to get food) - and my neighbours didn't snitch or complain. We did take a few precautions like hiding people's cars in my garage (putting my own on the laneway) and some people parking a street over and walking to my house. I didn't want to flaunt it, haha.</p>
<p>One of my brothers is completely paranoid and terrified of the virus. If anyone would be a snitch it would be him, so I don't tell him anything just in case. However, I think if it came right down to it he wouldn't actually go through with making that snitch call. Still, he and his wife have their small children in complete lockdown.</p>

        <p>No one in my neighborhood hides their parties.   It helps that our police chief has said they are not enforcing this BS, so snitching is pointless.  They don’t even come for petty crime either, though.  They tell you to file a complaint online.</p>

        <p>I am part of an online neighbourhood group and shockingly a few people on there mentioned having called the police because there were groups of kids hanging out in public and "not observing social distancing". IRL I don't know anyone who's done that, although I do have a few friends who've revealed themselves to have slightly authoritarian leanings.</p>
<p>Luckily I live in London (UK) where the police made it clear they would encourage people to comply with lockdown, but would not be implementing active enforcement. </p>
<p>UK society for the most part has been one of "live and let live", despite all the online warriors and NIMBYs wishing otherwise. (While police departments have set up "incident report forms" online, it's mostly been an empty gesture to placate the vigilantes. And some police efforts -- such as using drones to patrol outdoor areas -- drew a lot of criticism when used.)</p>
<p>This is not to say that I haven't had people sneer at me on the street for running past them or whatever. But I haven't experienced or witnessed any actual confrontations, thankfully.</p>

        <p>My neighborhood is full of crazy Karens who yell at me and my friends to wear masks and stay 6 feet apart from ourselves and them. We just ignore them, but yes, these people are everywhere, at least where I live.</p>
