    <strong>A friend told me today that Facebook told him the vaccine is made from aborted fetuses. I must have told him that at least 3 times last year.</strong>
    <p><p>Today, a friend gave me the bad news: A person on a certain Facebook group says that one of the vaccines has aborted baby "stem cells" and how the cells aren't really from a baby, but copies of cells from a baby, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I looked at him and nodded my head and shook my head and I said "hmm mmm" as if I was really listening and learning, and not fuming with anger.</p>
<p>He was telling me this as if I didn't know. As if I didn't tell him first. </p>
<p>I told him about the aborted fetuses in the vaccine months ago last year at least 3 times. He was around when I told other people. He listened when I told my mom over the phone. I brought it up again and again. I showed him that video where the woman is pointing at her computer screen and walking people through the ingredients on an AstraZeneca box.  </p>
<p>But Facebook told him so he finally listened. </p>
<p>The real question is what was going on in his head while I was telling him? Honestly, what was he thinking about? His shopping list? Was he just off in some dissociative fantasyland? Did he somehow just forget? Is it some kind of weird hypnosis? I just don't get it.</p>
<p>Maybe he was fucking with me, but I don't think so. That's not his style. He seemed genuine.</p></p>

        <p>I think it's simply that he didn't care and it didn't affect him then. Now he's thinking about it himself and open to listening.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s this. Some of my friends did the same too, they didn’t listened to almost anything I said. Some people are way too ignorant until it’s too late.  Their ego is too big. And I have some good friends that think like that.</p>

        <p>Well, whatever the reason is, I'm glad that it's a lesson learned that will save me from a lot of frustration in the future.</p>
