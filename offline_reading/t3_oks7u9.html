    <strong>Are any of you in a church where everyone took the vaxx and believes in this?</strong>
    <p><p>Are any of you in a church where everyone took the vaxx and believes in the Covid narrative? I care about the people in my church and they are very kind people but it's separated me from them inside. At least 90-95 percent of the church has gotten the vaxx, they are quite open about it and believe in "science". I am in a very liberal church. I know some have even vaccinated their children, the ones above 12.  I now worry about their influence on my husband lining up for the poison shot, we are going to Zoom services still, they are doing hybrid but he sees all the vaxxed people happily hugging. They have made it a rule for unvaxxed people to be masked, so the separation of unvaxxed from the vaxxed, is something I don't know if I can deal with. How will it feel to watch people eating together while you can't? Or happily hugging while you are a pariah? I was very happy in this church prior to Covid, and this is more heart break. I find myself thinking don't make enemies, wait for this to be over, and then happily return but seems more and more it won't ever be over. I care about the people but can't believe they just lined up and no one questioned anything. </p>
<p>I know they would be shocked at my musings about bible prophecy etc. They know I am an ex-evangelical/fundamentalist, was honest when I came in.  </p>
<p>I don't feel as comfortable there. I only told a few, some asked so insistently about the v, I just said I had health problems that impacted my decision which is true. I don't want to show up, wearing a mask so the whole place knows I didn't submit. I feel differently about things now. This upsets husband everytime I bring it up because this church was our main social outlet. I still am going to services and more, but I think how can you all support this and it's broken my heart. I also worry about what is going to happen to the people who took it because I care about them. This church was far nicer to us than any of the past ones who weren't very friendly to a disabled woman and judged people if they didn't have the normal middle class and above suburban lifestyle. They put great stock in intellectual freedom and things like that, so watching this parade, it has been beyond shocking.</p>
<p>:( Anyone else in this position...?</p></p>

        <p>&rt;I am in a very liberal church.</p>
<p>Honestly, I am not surprised that they have such a high vaxx rate and "believe in science." My observation of interacting with Christians from many denominations around the world reveals that charismatics/Pentocostals are the LEAST vaxxed and most sceptical of the narrative, followed by evangelicals. Liberal churches on the other hand are on the polar opposite.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; wait for this to be over, and then happily return </p>
<p>It won't be over. The schism in the church is only getting worse.</p>

<p>&rt;I know they would be shocked at my musings about bible prophecy etc. They know I am an ex-evangelical/fundamentalist, was honest when I came in.  </p>
<p>If your church is sceptical of Biblical prophecy then you may need to find another church.</p>

        <p>Yes the liberal churches are lining up and this one being the most liberal, they are very provaxx. It's been shocking to me.  I am glad Pentecostals are refusing. Around here even the baptists are lining up, I don't know if the fundamentalist baptists here have lined up or not. There was only one small church of those here, and I attended for a short while but left when they praised war and the place seemed run like a cult by the older pastor.  They put me down and ostracized us over being lower income. </p>
<p>I worry it won't be over. </p>
<p>I will admit I am in a very complicated spiritual place with the deconversion and my history. I am thinking bible prophecy is true. I wrote about it for more than 7-8 years on that blog. I may be "lost" anyhow given the deconversion. I never became an atheist and believed Jesus was a spiritual teacher with many others...[acceptable belief in my very liberal church]</p>
<p>I don't think one can "return" biblically, but I am trying to pray and figure out what to do. You seem like a nice person but the evangelical Christian world was a horrible place for me.</p>
<p>I also have to make sure given my history of spiritual abuse, and complicated history and autism, I have to be very careful when it comes to religion. I was basically in a cult before when I was in the IFB and got hooked up into a mini-cult with an abusive deliverance minister.  </p>
<p>My husband I think is worried that my past involvement in extreme religion is affecting me now. I am even trying to keep religion out of our discussions though it's come up a few times.</p>
<p>If my church knew what I was thinking inside, they would write me off as a "crazy "conspiracy theorist" and "qanon" [I never supported Trump in my life]</p>
<p>I may even take time off, to figure out what I want because I am in a confused place right now, and around fall, tell this church I am taking a "break" due to extreme illness. {which my health is poor enough this would be accepted} and then I would not completely burn any bridges. I was happy there for many years so this all is heartbreaking. I can't believe these things have been taken to the extent they have.</p>

        <p>No I haven't forgotten you. You are fortunate not to know what evangelicals are. I definitely will be rereading the bible and asking God to show me the truth. I am not sure one can deconvert and "go back', thinking of Hebrews 6 but if I am refusing the MOTB, maybe the being born again, "took". LOL</p>

        <p>That's a misunderstanding of Heb 6:4-6:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;4 It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, 5 who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age 6 and who have fallen[c] away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Unless you have ticked all of these boxes, it doesn't apply to you. This applies to "super Christians" who had attained an unusually high-level of maturity who ended up shaking their fists at God. I think that only John, Paul and possibly Peter ever attained that.</p>
<p>You're not too far gone, sunshine. All you need is to return to the Lord whose arms are open.</p>

        <p>In my area, there is a church that was promoting the vaccine and even allowed vaccine clinics on their property.</p>
<p>We have stopped going to church because of the false teachings that many pastors are into today. The Bible warns us that there will be many false teachers and that many in the church will be wolves in sheep's clothing.</p>

        <p>I saw a sign here for a baptist church to hold a pro-vaxx clinic in our inner city area and was horrified, but yes that is happening here. When I was a fundamentalist, I had some years where I consider myself a "home-churcher" and believed then the churches were "fallen away". I used to write about it on the old blog.  I wrote on the bible prophecy blog, all the churches except for very few would fall away and even now believe that Jesus never intended on an "empire".  Even for my liberal church, I was happy there, for years, but I feel different now, thinking how can they accept all this, why do they trust all of it? It is very scary to be in a group of people knowing they would consider you crazy for these differing opinions. I don't fit in conservative religious circles either, I mean I was IN THAT WORLD FOR FOURTEEN YEARS [I grew up Catholic] and now the left has betrayed me too. I guess I am screwed. May as well keep mouth shut IRL [I am speaking out online] and just become a hermit.</p>

        <p>My church is very small and we are all close and share most of the same beliefs. We have never required masks, even though it was mandated by the county, and we still met in person during the lockdown, just at different members houses. I started going here right before the pandemic and I believe God led me here for a reason. </p>
<p>I did attend Catholic mass a few months ago and it I knew it would be different but it was extremely uncomfortable. I asked if the daycare was open and they looked at me like I was insane, reminding me of the pandemic. Everyone had to wear masks, pews were blocked off, no one held hands or hugged. I felt no presence of the Lord in that church. </p>
<p>Here is a good Orthodox perspective on why creating a “dirty” class of people is not Christian: https://youtu.be/j4K06iUmQkU</p>
<p>There are churches out there not complying and not pressuring medical inventions on their members, just seek them out. You can always look around and attend a few different services to see if you feel more comfortable. No one should ever feel uncomfortable at their place of worship. Church is a place to let down your guard, worship, and never be judged by anyone other than God. </p>
<p>If you choose to stay at your church, just remember that you are strong and God didn’t make you to be loved or to fit in to this world. Pray about it and stand strong in your convictions. I will pray for you 🙏</p>

        <p>I am glad you have a close small church. Sounds like they have been supportive to you.  Yes all those pandemic rules it had to be horrible. I think creating a "dirty" class of people is very evil, they definitely are using it to separate people. I have heard of churches who aren't complying.  This one has especially to the extreme. I agree someone should feel comfortable where they worship, and not scared to voice an opinion. Thank you.</p>

        <p>It seems they've forgotten this...</p>
<p>“Those who live in the shelter of the Most High will 
find rest in the shadow of the Almighty. This I declare about the Lord: He alone is my refuge, my place of safety; he is my God, and I trust him. For he will rescue you from every trap and protect you from deadly disease. He will cover you with his feathers. He will shelter you with his wings. His faithful promises are your armor and protection. Do not be afraid of the terrors of the night, nor the arrow that flies in the day. Do not dread the disease that stalks in darkness, nor the disaster that strikes at midday. Though a thousand fall at your side, though ten thousand are dying around you, these evils will not touch you. Just open your eyes, and see how the wicked are punished. If you make the Lord your refuge, if you make the Most High your shelter, no evil will conquer you; no plague will come near your home. For he will order his angels to protect you wherever you go. They will hold you up with their hands so you won’t even hurt your foot on a stone. You will trample upon lions and cobras; you will crush fierce lions and serpents under your feet! The Lord says, “I will rescue those who love me. I will protect those who trust in my name. When they call on me, I will answer; I will be with them in trouble. I will rescue and honor them. I will reward them with a long life and give them my salvation.””
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭91:1-16‬ ‭NLT‬‬</p>
<p>I hold this near and dear to my heart.</p>

        <p>I am glad they leave it up to the person's choice. I was hoping I was "wrong" you know and that there would be some people like me who refused but as the numbers of people who told me they got it, increased, it was a problem. I nodded and smiled, I didn't want to be contentious with people. But of course on my end, there's no one to tell my opinion or what I am going through.</p>

        <p>Here they all talk about getting it, I hoped a few were lying but as time went on seems they did get it. I don't know if they are checking. I did try to warn a few, so told too many. I would have to lie, that I "gave in", lying is not easy for those on the autistic spectrum. I did consider it but the ethical aspects bother me. What if I had to join a legal or otherwise public fight later? There's also the problem that if a dangerous "variant" comes or they start dying of the vaxx that if I am "found out", I would be blamed. I don't want to sit in a backpew with a mask on as everyone else is happily hugging and eating meals. I already face enough social ostracization. Husband is going to be very upset if I tell him I am rethinking this church and is irritated about my pondering of the bible prophecy I used to blog about. I do think my deconversion was rooted in lack of fellowship, spiritual abuse and the fact I was in a life where there were no Christians around me especially after a move. Even with my religious views now with the liberal spirituality I can't submit to an evil system, and believe Jesus was right to warn about an "evil world system".</p>

        <p>Yes. I sent an open text to the leadership several months ago saying if there’s any hint of masks, experimental injections or (anti)social distancing then I am not interested. I fellowship with Christians who can see the agenda. I am still in touch with a few folk but the general failure to even make the connection with the mark of the beast I find bizarre.</p>

        <p>Yes i had to stop attending. Everyone lost their mind last year. First they were all about BLM which repelled me because I am in nyc and BLM is a destructive  terrorist group from my observation. I was grossed out that they were so naive they bought into the "anti racist narrative. A few vocal people made some extremely offensive statements about white people and I was not feeling the love, which I should be at my church. I pointed out the insanity of the BLM protests during a "pandemic" as well as the issue of the destruction of small businesses via the looting and rioting and people looked at me like I was nuts. Then the masks and fear. Constant fear. </p>
<p>I stopped attending. I now stream services from pastors who are normal and not pushing any of this crap. I am not going to let something that is supposed to give me spiritual support stress me out. It's the opposite of what it's supposed to be. I hope to eventually find a decent church community again but it seems that wokeism and coronatarianism has infiltrated a lot of religious institutions and I am not going to subject myself to any bullshit and additional stress voluntarily. If I have to behave like a trained seal and submit to these things it's not for me.</p>

        <p>I am waiting things out to see if this ends and I can be happily in the church again, I am still going to services etc, but keeping silent. They are my only social contact outside of husband. However more and more I worry this is not going to end, and things will only worsen. I used to support BLM, my church is into anti-racism and I am fine with that but I noticed everytime I talked about class, and economic issues that the rooms would shut down, I felt nervous. I have lived in the ghetto and worked in residential care with troubled inner city youth in gangs, and worse. It seemed my perspectives were not respected, and I found a lot of virtue signaling in the BLM lets paint murals on the streets while the ghettos economically collapse. I dropped out of all of that. I read books by Dubois and Bell Hooks and have interest in those things but the official corporate media BLM etc, is kind of disgusting me now. Covid policies are destroying our neighboring inner city area and no one cares. It's like pandering. Does that make sense? I felt the BLM rallies were used as distraction now.</p>
<p>I too wonder about stress and spiritual support. I can't be "me", if I opened my mouth and I was dismissed when I said a few mild statements, "I don't trust the new mRNA technology" that I know I am rethinking a lot of things. Their beliefs are closest to my own. I don't want to return to some of the problems I had in fundamentalist Christianity, where I was judged as a disabled person, with the racism, authoritarianism and sexism.  I was in the IFB before independent fundamentalist baptist. This church supports intellectual freedom and that is important to me. I think "wait things out" and be happy again, but how can I forget this? What if we really are near the "end" or there is going to be a new "reset" and this is 10 more years plus of BS where I can't get on board? I know I am in a lot of religious and spiritual confusion, and it shows on my posts. I am tired of the virtue signaling wokeism and say that as a leftist and loathe the censorship they all support. The blind and open bowing before corporations too, is sickening me. I did have a few in the church make jokes about me being a "radical" prior to Covid. I think I may be one of those people who questions society and society as a whole is ready to put me on the burning pyre, even the so called "left"</p>
<p>I loved being in this church for 5 years. My husband would flip out if he knew and a few times, I have told him I am reexamining the teachings of bible prophecy he is not happy and I can tell.</p>

        <p>For over ten years we went to our old church and loved it. When covid hit is shut down hard and I was surprised. We eventually found another church that never shut down and never required masks but was over one hour away. Despite the drive this new church felt right so we switched. One Sunday we didn’t feel up to the long drive and went back to our old church. Not only were they separating masked and unmasked people. They used the church to jab over 1000 people. So now we drive over one hour every Sunday for church but it’s worth it. </p>
<p>Masks and jabs are a symbol of faith or lack there of. Stick with the people who have faith in God not faith in the media.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear this happened to your old church. I tried to find churches an hour away after a move. I know that's rough and in our case being lower income it didn't work out. Yes the separation between the vaxxed and unvaxxed with the masks as a marker.  I am going to Zoom hybrid services but if I went back wearing a mask, I would be a pariah. I can feel "light ostracization" now in that maybe they can pick up my uncomfortableness. I did say a few things about totalitarianism and other subtle hints, but waking anyone up is a waste of time. My church did a survey and I wrote in there, if people want to wear masks, whatever their status let it be a choice.</p>

        <p>Good question. Jesus would not like people lining up to an evil government system that wants to experiment on children. </p>
<p>I told husband if you get it, that's submission and saying "yes" to everything that happens including the experimentation on children. I said even if I die of Covid at least I won't be guilty of supporting the whole enterprise.</p>
