    <strong>Florida: What's a good location/city?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a state that will be locked down hard again to March levels and I'm done. I've always wanted to move to Florida. I am a therapist and discovered a way to get licensed that I previously thought was impossible, so I'm now investigating where to move. </p>
<p>What cities are chill, open, and mask-free in Florida? I'm not a fan of the super big cities.</p></p>

        <p>Just stay outside of the bigger cities and you‚Äôll be fine. I would also recommend looking at state election maps‚Äîthe redder counties will be better.  </p>
<p>And FWIW, I don‚Äôt wear a mask anywhere. </p>
<p>Highly recommend moving here‚ÄîI never want to leave.</p>

        <p>As long as you stay away from the big cities you should be free of nearly all restrictions. Unfortunately you do have to wear a mask in Publix and Walmart which are very popular in Florida but that‚Äôs just about it.</p>

        <p>So is Orlando pretty bad with masks and security theater? I‚Äôm considering moving there since I‚Äôve heard things are wide open in Florida and there might be somewhat of a tourist industry there with Disney World and the other amusement parks to jump back into my career. I am in Bay Area California currently and there is no way it can be as bad as it is around here.</p>

        <p>I would try to stay away from the Orlando-Kissimmee area. The outskirts are OK. Smaller towns are better. All will be better than California, though.</p>

        <p>I just drove from Tennessee to Milton/pace/Pensacola and then down as far as port Charlotte. </p>
<p>The pan handle barely acknowledged any of this.  A few people here or there were wearing masks but it was very chill. Tennessee was about 50/50.  Some areas around Tampa were wearing masks more so but it‚Äôs a bigger city which tend to be more left wing. 
Ocala didn‚Äôt seem to care but I wasn‚Äôt in and out of many businesses. </p>
<p>Bradington/Sarasota was about 50/50 as well but no one said anything to people choosing to not wear face coverings but I wasn‚Äôt there long. </p>
<p>Basically everywhere was laid back but the pan handle was very laid back.  </p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt explore the east coast at all so I can‚Äôt comment although at the time there was a news article about a bar that did not allow patrons to were masks while there. </p>
<p>Mostly the politically conservative areas ignored COVID and the democrat areas were stricter which is odd since in the past conservatives would have been stricter and more follow the rules types and the ‚Äúliberals‚Äù would be more pro freedom. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm considering a move as well. The Milton/pace/Pcola areas will be super chill and cheaper housing. 
The p Charlotte, Venice areas are super nice but pricier.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm in Pensacola and basically nobody wears masks or anything. He‚Äôll not even the police wear them whenever I see them. Downtown is perfectly open and it‚Äôs incredibly easy to forget that there is a pandemic. Restaurants are open completely but some places like Publix still make you wear a mask.</p>

        <p>I will also be vacationing in south FL soon and am anticipating some BS. But I don't want to live where I'm vacationing so it's fine. Some of the live cams I see are already 100x better than where I live. People wear masks outside alone here and were going back into hard lockdown. It won't take much to get an improvement!</p>
