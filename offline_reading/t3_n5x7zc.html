    <strong>Depopulation agenda?</strong>
    <p><p>Back in 2010, Bill Gates said and I quote "Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent." See the video on https://youtu.be/JaF-fq2Zn7I?t=237</p>
<p>Current population of earth: 7,760,675,700+ according to https://www.census.gov/popclock/world</p>
<p>Current number of COVID-19 vaccines administered: 1,210,000,000+ according to https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/</p>
<p>Percentage of population vaccinated based on this data: 15.591425885764%</p>
<p>Coincidence? I'll let you decide.</p></p>

        <p>I feel like this mentality is the problem. We need to stop pretending we are at war. Everywhere you look it's a conflict, violence around every corner. The controlling class would have you believe that war is nature, and that the world couldnt exist without violence. </p>
<p>News flash, the world wouldnt exist without symbiotic relationships that foster life. The reason our bodies can survive here is because of the symbiosis between nourishing plant species that feed the food chain below us.</p>
<p>We are not at war. There has never been a war. We are all here, we are alive, and you, your neighbors and the people on the other side of the world are all the same. We all have hopes and dreams, and we know that we are all the same - sovereign human beings. </p>
<p>As long as you believe that we are at war, you necessitate the need for a power structure that takes you out of control and puts someone else above you. Once you realize that we are all equal and there is no true conflict, then you begin to take back your own power and your own life. </p>
<p>Stop perpetuating this war nonsense. Spread love instead.</p>

        <p>We can also sit around a campfire and sing kumbaya, but that doesn't change the fact that the people in power are violent sociopaths hellbent on destroying the world. Just in the last 14 months, they have caused incalculable damage to the economy, to people's health and well-being, arrested people simply for living their lives, forced millions into poverty and starvation while suicides, homocides, and domestic violence spiked. Sorry to break it to you, but this absolutely is war. They've made that part very clear.</p>

        <p>Not new, just tired of speculating and living in fear. </p>
<p>Either we are or we aren't part of some depopulation agenda. Is there something sinister going on? Absolutely. Ask most (normal) people and they will tell you that things don't add up. Have we been given reason to BELIEVE that all the hype is related to drastically reducing the population? No. Have we been given reason to SPECULATE? Not really.</p>
<p>Just because some rich asshole thinks theres too many people buying Microsoft at such a rate that he cant hire enough Indians for tech support doesn't necessarily mean that we are in trouble.</p>
<p>As far as anyone knows, this could be just a well orchestrated transferring of wealth between the government and healthcare institutions. </p>
<p>Does it really matter? No.</p>
<p>If we die, we die. We are all born to die anyways, there is no sense to living in fear. Live your life, understand why we are here, then focus on creating the world that you want to live in. When we put the power of our lives in others hands by perpetuating this nonsense about this agenda and that agenda then we lose our own power over our own reality.</p>
<p>Stop speculating about all the bad stuff that COULD happen, and MAKE your own future.</p>

        <p>Bill gates has actually said depopulation through vaccination is a goal. Yeadon has already made it known that infertility is a major mechanism of the pfizer vax. Agenda 21 &amp; the "green reset" is all about depopulation. See limits to growth published by the club of rome. </p>
<p>It's not speculation. This is actually what elite policymakers want and if you don't know that you're just willfully blind</p>

        <p>This is the way I look at it; nothing is guaranteed until it's already happened. Maybe this is what they are conspiring to do, but until we have some concrete evidence, I'm not falling into speculation anymore. Sure we have books about the great reset, but any two bit goon can write a book these days. Certainly BG has talked about reducing population thru jabs but talk is just talk. Maybe I'm indifferent because I wont let anyone else make my decisions for me. </p>
<p>Ultimately, if you know that there is even a chance of depopulation via jabs, just dont get the jab, it's that simple.</p>

        <p>I'm dumb and don't know anything, which is why I'm asking, but is it possible that he's talking about enriching medical help to people worldwide, and that the better healthcare and standard of living, the less people there may be, or the less population growth? I think poor people in the developing world have a much higher infant/youth mortality rate, so having many kids ensures that statistically some will make it to adulthood. Whereas I have free access to good healthcare, so I can just have 1 kid and be pretty certain that they will survive.</p>

        <p>The the birthrates of third-world immigrants is anything to judge by, that's not true. They move to rich countries and out-breed the locals 10 or more to 1. Just look at British schools. Wealth does not result in increased IQ or improved mentality.</p>
