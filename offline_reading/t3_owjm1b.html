    <strong>Calling out the blatant lies...</strong>
    <p><p>We all know that the media likes to twist things or find those statistical rarities and present them in a way to make people believe that covid is killing everyone it infects. It's not too hard to read through the bs when it comes to those articles, but it's the articles where the "facts" that are being reported are absolute blatant lies that I just can't take anymore.</p>
<p>Case in point...</p>
<p>I work for a local hospital system in California. Part of my job is running analytics for the higher ups.  This morning I read an article in the newspaper on the topic of vaccines in which the president of our hospital system is quoted as saying "not a single vaccinated person has been hospitalized for Covid since the beginning of the year." </p>
<p>That statement is complete and total bullshit. </p>
<p>Here's the truth...</p>
<p><strong>Every single patient that is currently in the hospital for Covid has received at least one dose of the vaccine.</strong> Every single one of them.  Now, granted half of them only received one dose of a two dose series, so technically they are not considered "fully" vaccinated, but what about the other half that received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine months ago.  They would be considered fully vaccinated, wouldn't they? </p>
<p>How is this ok? Why are we not only hiding the full truth from the public, but actually blatantly lying to them?  Are they worried the truth will cause panic among all the people that foolishly believed that the vaccines were the answer? Worse, why are they STILL pleading with everyone to get vaccinated when they know the real statistics. I expect it from the government and the media at this point, but knowing that the lies being reported are coming from the actual hospitals, from the people that have taken an oath to "do no harm" is just absolutely maddening.</p></p>

        <p>Masks are unfortunately making something of a comeback here in Palm Beach County due to how bad COVID supposedly is here. Until two weeks ago only 20-30% of people here in PBC were wearing masks indoors, now it seems to be about a 50/50 split.</p>
<p>Supposedly masks never went away in Miami-Dade and Broward counties in the first place. (It says a lot about the effectiveness of masks if masks were unable to prevent those counties from becoming COVID hotspots.)</p>

<p>Well, if you know the truth, what are you doing to expose it? Posting anonymously on reddit won't do a damn thing.</p>

        <p>I do get what you're saying, and if I thought it would make a tiny bit of a difference, I would actively work to expose it. But let's be honest, the media would do absolutely nothing with any information that goes against the narrative. Posting it on my personal FB page, which is the only social media account I have,  will just result in me being labeled a crazy extremist/conspiracy theorist and will be largely ignored, or even more likely, censored and removed. So why lose my entire career and means of supporting my family by doing something that will likely make little to no difference. So for now,  I'm keeping my own personal records of all the evidence of the lies being told and will hold on to that information until a time when the world is ready to see all the lies exposed (which will take something a lot bigger than this), and in the meantime, continue to post anonymously in a community of people that are actually interested in knowing the truth. </p>
<p>Tldr: Why throw away my entire career for a bunch of sheep that don't even want to know the truth?</p>

<p>Ditto and it takes not only courage but a bit of F-U money to expose your own employer's lies. But you can try to do it anonymously. For example if the newspaper prints the CEO's comments without questioning, you can assemble the real data and mail it to the reporter, along with an admonishment to stop taking things at face value. Or you can write a letter to the editor either anonymously or under an assumed name. </p>
<p>You could also identify activists in the community who would love to do the dirty work of exposing the lies and they don't even have to know it came from you.</p>
<p>It might not change one person's opinion even a little bit. But it might embarrass your company enough that they don't lie so blatantly. It might embarrass the newspaper enough that they don't accept any "facts" without proof or a follow-up question. It might give hope to a fellow employee who knew it was BS.</p>

        <p>Thank you.  I truly do appreciate the tips and advice. </p>
<p>I just got word that my employer is mandating the vaccine for all employees, even those that have no patient interaction and work 100% remote (as I have been since March of last year), and the only exception they'll allow is for those with medical documentation of a history of anaphylaxis to any of the vaccine ingredients. So basically it looks like I'll be out of a job come October 1st either way,  so that definitely changes things. So over the next few weeks here,  along with starting the job search, I'll also be  compiling as much data to expose their lies as I possibly can.  Honestly just feel sick by all this right now.  😔</p>
