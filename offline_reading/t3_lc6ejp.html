    <strong>I was alone at the gym and an employee came up to me to tell me that i need to wear my mask.</strong>
    <p><p>I was working out ten minutes before the gym closed so there was only one other person there, at least twenty feet away. I took my mask down to breathe better and an employee popped up out of nowhere, stood 3 feet away from me and told me I need to put my mask up when I’m on the floor, I can only put my mask down when I’m using the cardio machines (which are in the same room). So I have to wear my mask here if i’m working out, but not over there if i’m working out. Oh and I need to have it up even if there’s absolutely no one around me.</p>
<p>I’m so over this shit.</p></p>
