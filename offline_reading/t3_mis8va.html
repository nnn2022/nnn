    <strong>If our governments cared about us, they would have mentioned; Zinc, Vitamin D and Ivermectin</strong>
    <p><p>They (Big Pharma especially) benefit when people are sick, why would they promote healthy eating/Vitamins if instead they can make money off of medicines and get control through vaccines?</p>
<p>9/10 Covid deaths have been linked to low Vitamin D levels:</p>

        <p>I recall a govt released study that proved that taking 50,000 IU of vitamin d weekly was super effective in avoiding the worst case scenario of covid.  This was about 6 months ago.  Zinc I heard about being effective a few months into covid.  One of the earlier treatments since it is effective against the common cold.  I never heard of the other one, but that doesn't mean there wasn't some study on it or it wasn't being used.</p>
<p>Just cause you didn't read about it, doesn't mean it wasn't written about.  Like a child who plugs his ears, closes his eyes, and starts yelling "they never mentioned it,  they never mentioned it".</p>

        <p>If this was a viral pandemic the govt would go house to house handing out N95's and monthly food rations and taking your used up masks in biohazard containers to be burned at their facility. Instead we were left to survive on $8.70 a day in stimulus, essential workers got no hazard pay and no biohazard suits, and masks are literally all over the floor.</p>

        <p>Vitamin D is a universal thing. If you aren't white as chalk and don't live close to the equator, chances are that you are vitamin D deficient in the winter half of the year. It's an important factor in immune system activity and also positively impacts your mood alongside the other sun-dependent biochemistry.</p>
<p>Zinc sadly doesn't do much unless you are genuinely zinc deficient, it has been tested alongside HCQ a number of times and always failed to create a statistically significant benefit.</p>
<p>Quercitin and other flavonoids had a few papers published early on that showed how remarkably well they fit into the notches on the spike protein but I haven't read anything since. Seems like they are a dead end which is sad because it would have been an easy answer.</p>

        <p>So, this is only a personal experience, but considering the fact that I'm seeing some people in this sub making snarky comments like "just got the vaccine and I feel fine tee hee" I'll go ahead with mine:</p>
<p>I had/have a drinking problem, and though I exercised regularly was not in the best of health -- mainly due to said drinking problem.</p>
<p>I'm nearing 40 years old...I thought if I got Corona I'd certainly be a goner. Back around the early days of covid I heard about the Vitamin D thing. I began a regimen of Vitamin D, C, Quercetin, and Zinc -- as well as a few other supplements that I'd been hearing positive things about not strictly related to COVID... I wasn't entirely faithful but I figured it couldn't hurt.</p>
<p>Despite social distancing (never a problem for me I'm a bit of an introvert), diligent mask-wearing, being extra careful -- I got COVID this past November. I'm guessing it was from a co-worker (we'd gone remote shortly before Nov), or one of my forays into a local grocery store for items that weren't available via Walmart pick-up.</p>
<p>Couldn't believe it was COVID. I told myself it was probably something else. Lack of sleep, exhaustion perhaps. I'd been working pretty hard... The first night I had awful fatigue, fever chills, and felt near delirious like I was in a dream -- but I was in denial so I even went ahead and had my nightly dose of Vodka.</p>
<p>Went to sleep exhausted as hell, and with a high temp. Woke up the next morning, no fever but still exhausted. Felt fine enough to continue working remotely.</p>
<p>Following day, sickness was all but gone. Save for a lack of smell that lasted over a month.  A couple of weeks after I felt better, I went and got an antibody test, the results of which were positive.</p>
<p>For me, the worst symptoms only lasted about a day and a half. Once all had passed, I actually felt physically better than I did before I got COVID.  I obviously can't prove it, but I truly believe that the aforementioned vitamin supplements helped keep me from getting any worse.</p>
<p>In the light of all this, I've since cut back on my drinking drastically (it's a long road ahead...) and started thinking more seriously about my health.</p>

<p>Smell returned about a month later. I was actually hoping it wouldn't ever come back because it kept me from enjoying junk food (ha ha).</p>

        <p>This is just my experience, but take it as you will. I was sick for about a week before being formally diagnosed. I was taking Robitussin, Mucinex, and general stuff to keep it away, but to little use. I was still hacking up a lung and couldn't sleep for shit. This irked me because I usually get sick once every 3-4 years or so, and I'm typically better in a day. </p>
<p>My better half (thank God) forced me to go to medical that Monday, and I popped for covid. Started taking Vitamin D at the suggestion of my mother, along with a general supplement for Vitamin C, Zinc, and a butt ton of other minerals. By the end of the week, I was wanting to go back to work. </p>
<p>Maybe the bug just ran its course. Maybe the supplements helped. I don't know, but I think they did. I know around day 2 after taking the supplements I was already feeling much better.</p>

        <p>The vaccines are only authorized in the US (possibly others, haven't researched) under an emergency authorization that would not allow them to be expedited if available treatments ate viable. </p>
<p>Essentially, if Ivermectin or Hydroxychlorquine were "viable" treatment options, the vaccines would have to go through further studies and be approved by the FDA before being released in masses</p>

        <p>That's not all: the advice they give for avoiding COVID-19 is largely trash.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that washing your hands prevents the transmission of COVID-19.  And yet Fauci, Biden, and every public service announcement keep mentioning it.  It may prevent the common cold, but it does not prevent COVID-19.</p>
<p>You have to be indoors in heavily infected air for at least 10 minutes (and usually longer) in order to catch COVID-19.</p>
<p>The public service announcements should be saying things like:</p>
<p>"Open doors and windows when you have guests (any ventilation greatly reduces the risk)"</p>
<p>"Keep your business well ventilated."</p>
<p>"Meet outdoors whenever possible."</p>
<p>"Keep indoor visits to minimum with people from outside your household."</p>
<p>And of course, they should be constantly repeating the conditions that make you most vulnerable to COVID-19: obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and old age.</p>
<p>This stuff is NOT being said.  During recent surges in my area, it was obviously because of poorer people visiting family and friends in their own homes and working in certain environments, NOT from failing to wear masks when they left their houses.  The health authorities just ignored that stuff and kept going on about masks, social distancing, and hand washing.  It's like they WANTED people to keep spreading it.</p>

<p>Stay home.  Consume mainstream media and be afraid.  Don't go outside.  Avoid fresh air &amp; exercise.  Don't hang out with friends, visit family, or enjoy any hobbies.</p>

        <p>Yes I agree. They at least need to address why they don't give that advice, but literally no one asks them about it. I remember a few times on the news where local health were like 'sure it's good to have enough vitamin D but it won't stop you from dying of COVID'. Of course on the local news they never go into enough detail for anyone to realize they are just talking out their asses.</p>
