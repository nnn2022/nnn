    <strong>When did you start suspecting something was up?</strong>
    <p><p>I never really got scared about COVID-19.</p>
<p>I remembered H1N1 in 2009, when the papers and the news were all going crazy about the swine flu, and assumed this was another of these 'pandemics'.</p>
<p>Then lockdown #1 came. It sounded a bit excessive but I went along with it. 'Hey, let's do this for a few weeks and get this behind us'.</p>
<p>Then summer came, they slowly started re-opening businesses with a few restrictions, which, I assumed, would be slowly lifted. Then the muzzle came. Then lockdown #2 in October, which was the breaking point for me. </p>
<p>Ever since I don't believe anything we're being told. It's not about a virus.</p>
<p>It's getting worse week after week and yet.. a large chunk of people are still sleeping.. smh.</p></p>

        <p>Immediately. I never liked the idea of the lockdown, and felt it was going to go on for months and months on end if people didn't put a stop to it. I figured the government would continue them artificially for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Then I read up on Agenda 21 and the NWO, and I now understood the true motivation for this, and wasn't far off from my original theorizing.</p>

        <p>The second it came out. I remember being in college for H1N1 and people being scared and taking flu shots. I had a friend who got a flu shot every year, and every year she got the flu, where as I MAY have had the flu ONCE as a really young child, but I don't remember if that was when I had the chicken pox. If people are not falling down in the streets dead with boils, body parts falling off etc. Then life goes on. Maybe I'm just not scared of being sick idk. We were created to survive this stuff idk why people forget that.</p>

        <p>Back in january/february I thought it sound like bullshit. More media fear mongering, like swine flu or zika virus or MERS. Then when they started with the lockdowns in march I thought it was insane bullshit. I couldn't believe the people around me were putting up with it.</p>

        <p>I was never scared of COVID. I kind of supported not traveling and being around large groups of people at the very beginning. I never got behind the mask hysteria. I started to get really pissed off when the nearby states of South Carolina and Tennessee started reopening but my state of North Carolina was still delaying reopening. Then I realized that the Republican states were opening and the Democrat states were not opening. Then the BLM riots really pissed me off that it was suddenly okay to gather in mass. And at the same time, the media was trying to keep everyone else scared to death of COVID throughout the entire summer. </p>
<p>Like the OP, I assumed that once summer came and businesses slowly reopened that the restrictions would be slowly lifted. It is January 2021 and people are more scared than ever and the government is finding more situations where people have to be muzzled (outside, while exercising now).</p>

        <p>the first reaciton was perfectly reasonable. It's some bullshit from a chicom lab, God only knows what they did to it. </p>
<p>Once the survival rate was documented and established at &rt;99.5%, especially among &lt;65 year olds, that really should have been it. Secure the nursing homes if you want to, fair enough, but the rest doesn't add up.</p>

        <p>I know I got a big whiff of shit when my local county official said that not wearing a mask outside could result in 6 months in jail and up to a 10,000 dollar fine-she had to walk that one back. In my mind I was thinking why put someone in jail with others who may have a respiratory infection, that is certainly not contributing to the solution/why impose excessive fines on those struggling to make it in a hard hit economy. But when the windsurfer was outside ALONE in Los Angeles-when he was arrested for not abiding by the lockdowns-that's when I know nothing made any sense. No one is social distancing better than someone out on the water, on equipment that can only be used by one person at a time. And of course when the protests started for a dead crackhead who once pointed a pistol at a pregnant woman's belly-i was done. End the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I wasn't concerned at first for the same reason. Then when the "two weeks to slow the spread" got started, I was a little concerned, but then I still had to come to work everyday. I bought a month's work of groceries, just in case I got quarantined. The mask mandate absolutely sent me. I had a full panic attack when they started forcing those at work after hearing we shouldn't wear masks unless we had symptoms. I haven't trusted anything SINCE.</p>

        <p>Why is that embarrassing to say? Not embarrassing at all. We all had to see the truth at some point. Also, it was bullshit that people gave you shit because you were depressed about lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I guess it was embarrassing because I’m not like a huge Elon fanboy or whatever. He’s got kind of a cult of personality and that’s fine and all but I don’t form opinions based on what celebrities think. I just find him interesting and he was the first high profile person that I saw openly criticizing it.</p>

        <p>When I looked at the data, saw that this pandemic wouldn’t be that bad, and then governor closed all restaurants the very next day. That’s when I knew something extremely fishy was going on. Either the data was wrong and they knew something I didn’t (not the case) or this was some kind of political conspiracy.</p>

        <p>In early March I had my suspicions, especially with the previous Swine Flu madness.</p>
<p>I even joked with a silly conspiracy that this was created for hand sanitiser companies to sell their products. I told people to stay calm, keep healthy - and don’t worry - this is not a plague - nowhere near the devastation of the Spanish flu. You don’t understand how many times I had to debunk these stupid tweets telling us that the virus will come for the young in wave 2.</p>
<p>Lockdown 1? Fun fun fun, I suppose. Working from home. No commutes, no waking up early in the morning. A short break from life. There was a sense of camaraderie in the community. People, myself included volunteered to help out the NHS. People ran and made a donation to the NHS. There was a community spirit.</p>
<p>But I started to have skeptical thoughts due to two things - around mid-April, when I understood the grievances of the protestors (though I was like - come on, it’s not going to go much longer) - and my then estranged aunt starting to sending me lockdown-skeptical videos. </p>
<p>Then it got extended. The exchange of information between me and my aunt became frequent. But I still thought ‘we do need it for a little longer’ - even though the effects on society were disastrous. How naive I was. Now 10 months later things have become even worse.</p>
<p>I can pinpoint the time I became extremely depressed and suicidal when the masks came into the picture.</p>

        <p>From the off I was suspicious. The fake news publishing young adults deaths as coronavirus caused, and then their families writing in to the papers telling them it was bs. Also, anyone with a brain has to be very suspicious of a government quarantining the healthy, especially when it's a CCP export..</p>
<p>Luckily Peter Hitchens was talking about his opposition to it early on and was backing it up with various experts around the world. Sadly, very few listened then and few listen now.</p>

        <p>January 31st. My family was talking about it, and I was like "look it's just to make China look bad". I didn't think it'd go on for this long, but with each month, I'm more and more skeptical. I don't think it's to make China look bad anymore, think it's way worse!</p>

        <p>At the beginning I was cautious. Then when the first lockdown ended a housemate had to go to another country on important business. Whilst there every family member of theirs was diagnosed with covid. I was generally concerned for them. They told me they hadn't caught it, but I was still doubtful and worried when they returned and self isolated. I explained to the company I worked for that they were isolating but was told I could still work unless I had symptoms. Needless to say I never got any. So yeah, chances are I may have caught it at some point but after that I started questioning just how serious it really was.</p>
