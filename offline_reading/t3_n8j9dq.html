    <strong>The Opioid Epidemic caused by Big Pharma never ended, and nobody was ever really held accountable for it. The same will happen if COVID vaccines turn out to be dangerous</strong>
    <p><p>Big Pharma is almost entirely responsible for the Opioid Epidemic. It did not start organically. It started as a direct result of the overprescription of highly-addictive opioids, which led to people eventually turning to harder drugs like heroin and fentanyl once the pills were no longer accessible. </p>
<p>The Opioid Epidemic has killed roughly as many people as the COVID pandemic over their respective lifetimes, with around five to six hundred thousand officially dying from each one (in the US.) It is ongoing in many parts of the country (with far more deaths than COVID in some areas like San Franciso) yet we don't care anymore. </p>

<p>Big business profited greatly, but won't be punished. Furthermore, pharmacists knowingly dispensed highly-addictive drugs to individuals that they knew were abusing them, and did nothing about it. </p>
<p>https://treatmentmagazine.com/news-posts/will-walmart-face-punishment-for-opioid-prescription-practices/ </p>
<p>Doctors were often complicit (if not actively engaged) in furthering the epidemic. Purdue (the driving force of the epidemic) knew of numerous doctors that were writing illegitimate prescriptions for opioids, yet did nothing to stop them. </p>

<p>https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/opioid-manufacturer-purdue-pharma-admits-guilt-fraud-and-kickback-conspiracies </p>
<p>Purdue paid doctors to overprescribe opioids. They were charged with (and admitted to) violating the Anti-Kickback Statute. Not only did they personally pay doctors to write more prescriptions for their product, they paid an electronic health records company to "refer, recommend, and arrange the ordering of Purdue's opioid products." </p>
<p>Furthermore, they were found to have "represented to the DEA that they maintained an effective anti-diversion program when, in fact, Purdue continued to market its opioid products to more than 100 health care providers whom the company had good reason to believe were diverting opioids." </p>

<p>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/24/purdue-pharma-pleads-guilty-charges-admits-role-opioid-epidemic/6413789002/ </p>
<p>Furthermore, they used marketing firms to increase sales of their highly addictive drugs. It wasn't enough to just make their highly-addictive poison, no, they had to actively dump it into poor areas like rural West Virginia. Nobody did anything to stop them at any step of the way. </p>

<p>The Sackler family (who owned the company and are exceedingly wealthy) intentionally peddled this garbage knowing the dangers. Regardless of whether or not it would harm people, they pushed for increased market share and use of their product (sound familiar?) </p>
<p>https://abcnews.go.com/US/jersey-sues-sackler-family-purdue-pharmas-alleged-role/story?id=63380541 </p>
<p>https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/hearings/the-role-of-purdue-pharma-and-the-sackler-family-in-the-opioid-epidemic </p>
<p>Purdue was fined $10 billion for their role in the Opioid Epidemic. That sounds like a substantial amount of money, until you consider the fact that they made over $30 billion from Oxycontin alone. There was a $20 billion net gain for them from their role in the Opioid Epidemic. Crime doesn't pay, right? </p>
<p>Furthermore, in 2007, the company pleaded guilty to misbranding Oxycontin as far less dangerous and far more effective than it actually was. </p>
<p>They knew the entire time that it was horribly addictive and unsafe to be prescribed as it was being prescribed, but they didn't care, as it helped grow their profits. </p>
<p>Even though there was concrete evidence from their own internal controls that doctors were prescribing far more doses than needed, the company did absolutely zero to stop it. </p>
<p>"Between 2007-2017, Purdue ignored doctors suspected of improperly prescribing opioids that were flagged by its internal controls, and failed to report OxyContin prescriptions from these physicians to the Drug Enforcement Administration as legally required." </p>
<p>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-opioids-plea-idUSKBN2842SQ </p>
<p>Folks, this is not ancient history. This is happening right now, in the present day. These companies don't give a flying fuck if you live, die, or spend the rest of your days in horrific agony as a direct result of using their product. </p>
<p>According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, as referenced earlier in my post, over 500,000 people in the US have died from the Opioid Epidemic. </p>
<p>Most of them were innocent people. Think blue-collar workers who got an injury on the job, young athletes who got an injury playing sports, or older folks who had chronic ailments that just wouldn't resolve on their own. They trusted that their doctor would help them get better, and they were wrong. </p>
<p>Their doctors were bought and sold by Big Pharma, and overprescribed them highly-addictive narcotics to make a quick buck. Once they could no longer prescribe more to the now-addicted patient, they cut them off cold-turkey, offering no treatment or help. </p>
<p>Many then turned to the streets, buying low-quality heroin full of dangerous impurities or highly-potent fentanyl. Many turned to crime as a way to support their habit and new inability to hold a job as a result of their addiction. </p>
<p>Over half a million people may have died so far from the epidemic, but how many families and adjacent lives were also forever ruined? </p>
<p>How many formerly vibrant communities were absolutely gutted by a substantial portion of their citizens becoming drug-addled, unrecognizable shells of their former selves? </p>
<p>The amount of damage inflicted on this country as a result of Big Pharma conspiring with scientists, doctors, pharmacists, government agencies, and other supposedly trustworthy institutions and individuals is incalculable. </p>
<p>"Trusting the Science" cost over half a million people their lives, and countless more their livelihoods. Science in this country has whored itself out to anyone who has enough money and power to influence it. </p>
<p>The "Science" behind opioids was all a bunch of garbage, yet was still justification enough for the mass overprescription of them. It was all garbage funded by the makers of said drugs, and yet nobody questioned it. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, nothing will be done. Out of all the people involved, barely any have been convicted of any crimes. </p>
<p>The Sacklers, who personally profited more than anyone from the epidemic, received immunity from further prosecution in a deal with the government. None of them will ever see jail time, and they will likely be allowed to keep the vast majority of their ill-gotten fortunes. </p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/2021/05/03/991648432/25-states-mount-legal-fight-to-block-sackler-bid-for-opioid-immunity </p>
<p>There is no justice or recourse for those who were directly harmed by the actions of Purdue. None of those responsible for the wholesale slaughter of half a million Americans will ever personally suffer to any great degree for their actions. </p>
<p>https://observer.com/2020/10/purdue-pharmaceutical-settlement-no-jail-time-sacklers-outrage/ </p>
<p>How does this tie into the New Normal? Take a look at what happened here. Should these vaccines ever turn out to be dangerous, you will never have a way to do anything about it. All manufacturers and developers have complete exemption from liability. </p>
<p>Nobody will be held liable personally, and those who profited off your suffering will never really lose that profit. You will be left with whatever ailments their product gave you, and you'll get a "sorry" at best. </p>
<p>Remember this lesson from the Opioid Epidemic - your doctor does not necessarily have your best interests at heart. Your pharmacist doesn't have any qualms about giving you medication that could ruin your life. Your government will not protect you from the evils of Big Pharma and predatory "Science." </p>
<p>It is up to you to preserve the integrity of your body, mind, and soul. It is up to you to make an informed decision as to what you are putting into your body. </p>
<p>Others will pressure you, no doubt. But if you're the unlucky bastard who gets harmed, they will cast you out with last weekend's garbage. The people trying to shame, coerce, or force you into receiving an experimental injection will turn their backs on you should it harm you. </p>
<p>That would hurt their "safe and effective" narrative. Nobody could be harmed by a COVID vaccine in their minds. The cognitive dissonance is strong. </p>
<p>They have been conditioned to believe that these injections have zero capacity to do anything bad, and their minds cannot reconcile that belief with the fact that people are reporting being hurt by them. </p>
<p>As a result, they must pick and choose - one of those things must be false. They don't want to believe that their beloved vaccine could be anything but a perfect miracle, so they will choose to block out any mention of side effects, regardless of how valid they might be. </p>
<p>Dropped dead 20 minutes after your experimental MRNA vaccine from an ultra-rare brain hemorrhage previously seen once in a generation? </p>
<p>Coincidence. Correlation does not necessarily equal causation. Probably was COVID. Get that man a 40-cycle PCR test, stat! </p>
<p>Skin peeled off post-vaccination and left you looking like a blood-red version of a marshmallow after it fell off someone's stick and melted in the campfire? </p>
<p>Probably just anxiety from getting the shot. Happens to the best of us, really. When you go in for your booster, make sure to practice controlled breathing techniques. </p>
<p>Complete paralysis immediately after injection that leaves you unable to move the right half of your body? Probably just didn't eat enough before your shot. When you get your second dose, make sure to bring some juice and crackers. </p>
<p>I kid, but I have seen posts and replies not far off from those. At the end of the day, if you still trust Big Pharma and your government, go get your shot. That is 100% your choice. But I urge you to do your research first, and make a truly informed decision. Do not succumb to peer pressure. </p>
<p>And when I say "do your research," I don't mean do a deep dive into some random guy's conspiracy blog that appears to be more about chronicling his descent into paranoid schizophrenia than displaying anything of substance. </p>
<p>Read the legal histories of the companies producing and distributing the vaccines. Try to primarily read sources ending in .edu or .gov. </p>
<p>Look up what Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, and AstraZeneca have been involved with legally. I promise you that you will think twice about getting a vaccine after reading into their histories. </p>
<p>Look up the judgments against them. Look up the settlements. Look up the charges and criminal complaints. See if you still trust them. </p>
<p>Read official data from the CDC's own website. It will tell you that if you are not exceedingly old or unhealthy, you have a negligible chance of dying with (not even necessarily from) COVID. </p>
<p>Read legitimate, credible, unbiased sources. The information is out there. </p>
<p>Don't let anyone tell you that you need to have a PhD in epidemiology or virology to read readily-available CDC data (that has already been tidied-up to make it usable by the general public) indicating that the disease poses little risk to most people. </p>
<p>You do not need to have a Juris Doctor degree to read DoJ press statements about what companies such as Purdue and Pfizer have done in the past. They have already put it into plain English for the layman to read. </p>
<p>Ask yourself - do you really believe that for-profit companies like Pfizer would place your wellbeing over their profits and market share? </p>
<p>Pfizer certainly doesn't have a proven history of misrepresenting their products and marketing them for unsafe and unproven uses, and offering kickbacks to corrupt doctors that push these products on their faithful patients. </p>
<p>So we should all be good, right? </p>
<p>https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history </p>
<p>Research science is certainly not biased in any way, shape, or form by the influence of Big Pharma. Ignore the fact that "60% of department chairs have some form of personal relationship with the pharmaceutical industry, and two-thirds of departmental units are firmly obligated to the industry by way of research equipment, unrestricted funds, residency or fellowship training support, continuing medical education support and funding from intellectual property licensing." </p>
<p>https://www.newsweek.com/2014/05/30/sunshine-act-will-publicize-big-pharmas-undue-influence-doctors-251736.html </p>
<p>That doesn't mean anything. Surely, for-profit Big Pharma companies ask for no return on their multi-billion dollar investments in researchers and institutions. They don't have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders, right? </p>
<p>Do not blindly trust anyone, regardless of how respectable, credible, or professional they seem. That is how you become a victim - if you don't believe me, just ask one of the more than 500,000 folks who trusted their opioid-peddling doctors just a bit too much. </p>
<p>Actually, that one might be a bit difficult.</p></p>

        <p>Well, I personally agree with you based on what I've seen. But many folks that could be shown the truth will at first be skeptical of anecdotal evidence when there is such a concerted media effort to frame COVID vaccines as 100% safe and effective. </p>
<p>I decided that it would be better to show them how to arrive at their own conclusions like many of us have.</p>
<p>The average person still trusts the powers that be. I was hoping with this post that I could show them why that's a terrible idea.</p>
