    <strong>"It's about people's health!"</strong>
    <p><p>This is a line I hear constantly, and can't wrap my head around. Simply because I don't think it is about health. </p>
<p>If this whole thing was to protect people's health, why are apps like GrubHub and DoorDash exploding in popularity, despite having an ACTUAL obesity epidemic (speaking as an American here)? Why are fast food places still allowed to be open and function as normal but places to get healthy food have either been restricted or closed completely? Why is there more push for staying at home in a little bubble and watching the news while crying instead of being active? Why are 600 pound land whales allowed to screech at people not wearing a mask and then getting winded if they have to walk up more than half of a curb or, god forbid, an inclined sidewalk? Why is the government preaching about health but keeping gyms closed up like movie theaters?</p>
<p>I'll be up front about it. I'm not the healthiest person. I've been working on fixing my habits and making better choices, and good lord this hysteria over some sissy little virus has kicked that motivation into overdrive. I'd rather die happy running around forests than live as some sad pile of pudge binging League of Legends because I'm too terrified to even look at another person.</p></p>

        <p>You are starting to get it. It's not about health. Want to see what 'health' it is about? Look at the profits of the largest corporations! That is all this is about. Look at who is profiting from the companies making this 'vaccine'. That is what this is about.</p>

        <p>People with real illness should be taken care of, not people who fear for a flu.</p>
<p>They suffer real symptoms which have real deep impact on daily life(if we can call that living in many cases) often for many years past and to come, thats is very hard to sustain for most.</p>
<p>This should be a high priority, not covid. </p>
<p>people are backward and sick in their mind, they need help too, but not the "vaccine" kind of help.</p>

        <p>Idiots think that health = the absence of COVID, poor health = the chance of catching it. All other health concerns are now irrelevant.</p>
