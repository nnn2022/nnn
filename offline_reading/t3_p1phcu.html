    <strong>Living with a vaccinated partner?</strong>
    <p><p>I do! The plus is he can get me food during the apocalypse, but it does come with its own set of challenges. He got the vax early due to his profession. He accepts my decision, but isn't completely supportive. Like if I'm stressed about something, instead of being like "yes fight back against this!" he's like "why don't you just get it then?" When I told him the feedback I gave on a work committee around "return to office," he advised that I don't say stuff like that anymore bc I could lose my job (all I said is that we need to offer options besides the vaccine because not everyone is comfortable with it right now). </p>
<p>We live in a place with few restrictions, travel is mostly the same for vax/unvaxxed, and my job hasn't mandated. I don't think he'll be supportive if I'm faced with losing my job or if vax-only mandates come into play here. I wish I had a partner that was fighting besides me rather than just tolerating it because it doesn't inconvenience him...yet. I wonder how many relationships (friends, family, partner) are being destroyed by this?</p>
<p>How are you holding up living with a vax partner? How is this affecting other relationships?</p></p>

        <p>From what I am gathering, and maybe someone can confirm or correct me, the jab doesnt protect against jack shit. It just eliminates symptoms so if people contract, they won't be inconvenienced with symptoms. In other words, it masks the virus making infected people clueless they are contagious. </p>
<p>That being said, the virus is being carried around and spread by a fully vaccinated person easier then an unvaccinated person, because the unvaccinated person at LEAST has the edge to be able to know when they are sick. </p>
<p>As far as mutating viruses, this happens when people are vaccinated improperly and allows a virus to continue and mutate. Unlike small pox vaccine which its aim was to eradicate the actual virus, the covid jab only serves to mask symptoms. </p>
<p>The superspreaders are the partially and fully vaccinated people walking around with a virus they have no idea they have.</p>

        <p>There's definitely a lot of unsettled questions at this point. Much too unsettled to make long term decisions like getting a vaccine you don't want. And much too unsettled to mandate for employees. This stays with you the rest of your life. Your job can fire you at will for no reason (for the most part). It is unethical for them to ask you to make irreversible decisions when all jobs are essentially "temp jobs."</p>

        <p>Exactly. And people saying they were forced to get it? No, you were pressured and you buckled. Not all of us are that weak willed or lack critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>I for one know based on video games alone, you do not rush production of a video game. It will be filled with glitches, freezes, crashes and updates won't come quick enough! </p>
<p>Sure the masses line up for it, thats not a determining factor as the masses line up for chick-fil-a! And if video games have taught me another thing, its when you encounter resistance or enemies in your path, you are going the RIGHT way. </p>
<p>Stay strong. You know you are right!</p>

        <p>At one point they said it would take 5 years and then Trump said no you need to do it in 9 months. I always think about what happens at my job when we are forced into a shorter timeline....shortcuts are taken, less than optimal products are released, customers are inconvenienced.</p>

        <p>Many relationships are being destroyed by this. The supporters of the Covid regime, who vastly outnumber people like us, at least where I live and in my more general experience, despise us, it would seem. It is more disconcerting than I have words to describe.</p>

        <p>I've actually been delighted with my wife over this. I was very resistant to the idea, and only caved when it was clear I was running out of time to opt for the traditional Sinovac type of vaccine.</p>
<p>Still got damn side effects and so refuse the 2nd. Recently it's become known locally they will be forcing that 'conspiracy theory' of passports. When I showed her that she just hugged me and was all "Well fuck em, I can do the shopping and we can eat good food and watch movies, or order Grab or something."</p>
<p>Didn't even begin to suggest I reconsider a 2nd shot or complain it will be a hassle. Hashtag Keeper</p>

        <p>So this one rings home for me; my wife (she’s 22, I’m 23) is extremely depressed because her parents nonstop badger her with their propaganda. Telling her she’s going to die, our 5 month old son is going to die, nana is going to die, etc. they’re guilt shaming her. Previously she would get furious with me when I start spewing what I believe to be facts about this vaccine. After seeing her frustration; I merely asked her to trust me as her husband as I will never lead her or our family to danger or astray. Not immediately, but days after, her demeanor has changed a bit. She doesn’t want the vaccine, her hold up has been not wanting to affect other people by not getting it. I told her that’s not your job nor life’s position to worry about things other than our family at the moment, and that we want to have more children soon, I just kindly asked her to trust me until at least after the children are born, then she can make her decision (I told her I’d repect her decision nonetheless I just said I thought it was really ducking stupid to vaccinate when we’re at absolutely no risk of this shit). She fully recognizes the weird coercion’s happening. God help us all, they are purposefully trying to tear our families apart. We will be nowhere without our families. If my in laws continue to push her, I will gladly step up and tell them to fuck off with it. I refuse to allow others to emotionally torment my wife.</p>
