        <p>Free societies put restrictions on behavior all the time, and they remain free societies. Drunk driving, for example. You are free to drive, but you are not free to drive while drunk, because it poses a risk to public safety. It‚Äôs not healthy for a society to allow anyone to do literally anything they want, especially to do actions that, when replicated en masse, are guaranteed to put others in harm‚Äôs way.</p>

        <p>We all draw the line a little different. But if we are now classifying simply walking down the street as ‚Äòallowing anyone to do literally anything‚Äô then I think our society has strayed a <em>long</em> way from ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô.</p>

        <p>Nobody is saying you can‚Äôt walk down the street, they‚Äôre just asking you to wear a little piece of cloth on your face when you do it. That‚Äôs not a slippery slope to fascism and government brain control, it‚Äôs a well-intentioned piece of public safety advice that is recommended by public health experts around the world to help keep the people around you healthier. </p>
<p>If you‚Äôre worried about people turning into sheeple via government mind control, then you‚Äôre better off protesting the fact that kids are made to recite the pledge of allegiance every morning, or protesting laws that enable voter suppression, or protesting laws that outlaw boycott of Israel, or any other number of legitimate breaches of human rights.</p>

        <p>Here‚Äôs a some excerpts from the list of exceptions to the ‚Äústay at home‚Äù guideline (which can be found at the following URL, and is linked to on the link you just provided: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tier-4-stay-at-home#stay-at-home ):</p>
<p>&rt;People can also exercise outdoors or visit some public outdoor places, such as parks, the countryside accessible to the public, public gardens or outdoor sports facilities. You can continue to do unlimited exercise alone, or in a public outdoor place with your household, support bubble, or with one other person if you maintain social distancing. You should follow the guidance on meeting others safely.</p>
<p>&rt;You can leave home to buy things at shops or obtain services from a business which is permitted to open in your Tier 4 area, but you should stay local. For instance you can leave home to buy food or medicine, or to collect any items ‚Äì including food or drink ‚Äì ordered through click-and-collect or as a takeaway, to obtain or deposit money (for example, from a bank or post office), or to access critical public services (see section below).</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre allowed to walk to the park to exercise, or to the store to buy a soda, then this ban on waking down the street that you‚Äôre describing must not be as severe as you‚Äôre making it out to be. The full list of exceptions is quite exhaustive, and gives you plenty of excuses if you have the desire to walk down the street. You‚Äôre blowing these guidelines out of proportion and sensationalizing them in an attempt to prove your point - unless you have evidence that people in the UK are being fined and detained for walking down the street in tier 4 areas.</p>

        <p>&rt;Large parts of the country went into T4 from this midnight, so we‚Äôll see.</p>
<p>What about the parts of the country that were already in T4? You couldn‚Äôt find any evidence of people getting locked up for being found walking down the street, huh? If that‚Äôs the case, then you are absolutely sensationalizing these shut down orders and blowing them out of proportion.</p>
<p>&rt;Having to have an excuse to go out would have been unthinkable here a year ago.</p>
<p>So what? Being expected to stand 6 feet apart from people at the store was also unthinkable a year ago. Then, COVID spread more and more, and the seriousness of the pandemic became more clear to politicians and public health experts, and it became clear that precautions like these would be in the best interest of the public‚Äôs health because they would save lives. And many studies have shown that social distancing measures, including shut downs, did, in fact, save lives. See below for a few examples of such studies:</p>
<p>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239798</p>
<p>https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00608</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200910110824.htm</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7307990/#!po=0.877193</p>
<p>https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=covid+meta+analysis+social+distancing+decrease+deaths&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart#d=gs_qabs&amp;u=%23p%3DylfxRKmuu6UJ</p>
<p>&rt;By the time we reached a state that you think could be legitimately called ‚Äòoppressive‚Äô it would likely be too late to do anything about it.</p>
<p>I can distinguish between well-intentioned public safety measures that are implemented to save lives and legitimate examples of government overreach and oppression. You‚Äôre relying on the slippery slope fallacy for your argument. </p>
<p>Already during the pandemic, the lock down measures have become less severe (i.e. have switched from higher tiers to lower tiers, to use the UK‚Äôs system as an example) when the numbers of cases and deaths were low enough to indicate that easing up on shut down measures would be safe to do. You seem to be suggesting that you might be expected for provide a reason to walk down the street well after the pandemic is over. The fact that we‚Äôve gone up and down tiers already during the pandemic suggests otherwise, as it demonstrates that these measures are not intended to be permanent. They are intended to be temporary, and assuming otherwise is to succumb to the slippery slope fallacy, unless you have any real evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>&rt;This is what all those ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô individuals are concerned about. They are trying to prevent us getting to that point, rather than just continually telling people it‚Äôs ‚Äònot that bad‚Äô right up until it is that bad.</p>
<p>What the ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô individuals fail to understand is that it‚Äôs healthy for a society to decide to make temporary, if disruptive, lifestyle changes if public health experts say those changes are necessary to save lives. Crying ‚Äúoppressive authoritarianism‚Äù at any instance of the government asking you to make a temporary change to your lifestyle, without analyzing that specific instance‚Äôs individual merits to determine whether or not it really would save lives, is an invalid argument grounded upon nothing but fear and paranoia. </p>
<p>There is a line to be drawn between government actions that constitute oppression, and government actions that constitute the well-intended guidance of public health experts. If one is too paranoid, they will lose sight of that line, as I believe you and many others here have. As I‚Äôve said in a previous post, there are many examples of real government oppression, and the UK has historically been the perpetrator of many instances of such oppression (one can find many examples by reading a book about the history of how the UK has treated its colonies throughout the last few centuries). The COVID response, generally speaking, is not one of those examples. </p>
<p>The shut downs and such precautions could‚Äôve been executed in a more effective way by the UK and practically every other government in the world, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that these measures did succeed in slowing the spread of COVID and saving tens thousands, or more likely hundreds of thousands, of lives worldwide.</p>

<p>This is reasonable. However, one part of your post is unreasonable, and I will point that out now:</p>
<p>&rt;If instead it‚Äôs the same or worse, regardless of [reasons]</p>
<p>You can‚Äôt just lump every possible reason for a government action together like this. It‚Äôs indicative of a lack of intellectually rigorous analysis on your part. I‚Äôve already explained in my previous post how important it is to analyze the best available evidence to determine whether any particular government regulation is oppressive or is based in good public health policy. </p>
<p>You can‚Äôt just dismiss the guidance of public health experts as [reasons]. If the pandemic is still ongoing a year from now (god forbid), and social distancing measures were still needed to save lives, then the government advising people to follow those measures would still not constitute real oppression. If the pandemic is still ongoing a year from now, I would expect that those experts would be able to make new recommendations for the details of shut downs (like which business might need to reduce their capacity and by how much) based on over a years‚Äô worth of research into the effectiveness of various social distancing and shut down measures. Hopefully, those new recommendations would be less disruptive than the ones we face now.  </p>
<p>Obviously, though, my true hope, and the true hope of basically everyone on earth (including both people who support social distancing measures and those who sneer at such measures alike) is that the vaccine rollout will be successful and will allow the world to go back to normal well before next Christmas. Nobody likes the shut down measures. Nobody likes not being able to see their families and friends as often as they‚Äôd like. But, if the pros outweigh the cons, as they do in the case of the temporary COVID shut downs, then it‚Äôs a necessary sacrifice for the greater good, and should be tolerated in order to preserve human life.</p>

        <p>One thing which has been apparent, particularly in the UK, is that the reasons change, but the restrictions remain. Always there is a slightly different narrative to explain why we need continued restrictions and why we are idiots for questioning it. Past a certain point, some of us grow suspicious.</p>
<p>Since ‚Äòreasons‚Äô usually entail subjective value judgements, my ‚Äònormal by Christmas‚Äô was an attempt to offer an absolute metric, independent of justification.</p>

        <p>&rt;One thing which has been apparent, particularly in the UK, is that the reasons change, but the restrictions remain. Always there is a slightly different narrative to explain why we need continued restrictions and why we are idiots for questioning it. Past a certain point, some of us grow suspicious.</p>
<p>What reasons have they provided that weren‚Äôt consistent with the ultimate goal of reducing the spread of COVID in order to save lives?</p>
<p>&rt;Since ‚Äòreasons‚Äô usually entail subjective value judgements,</p>
<p>I suppose it‚Äôs true that not everyone subjectively values the merits of taking temporary measures in order to save hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lives (citation: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3638575). I suppose some people would be fine with letting so many people die without trying to implement temporary measures to prevent those deaths from occurring.</p>
<p>&rt;Are you able to suggest an alternative, objectively verifiable, circumstance within a given timeframe and irrespective of external factors?</p>
<p>An alternative circumstance to what? An alternative to using COVID infection and mortality rates as a metric for ending shut down/social distancing measures? Please let me know if I‚Äôm not understanding your question properly. </p>
<p>COVID infection and mortality rates are extremely important ‚Äúexternal factors‚Äù that cannot be excluded in any analysis of whether a pandemic shut down measure is justified or not. If I‚Äôm mischaracterizing your argument, then I apologize and hope you will clarify it for me, but it seems to me that you continue to try to divorce shut down measures from their life-saving effects, which is a nonsensical way to analyze the necessity of shut down measures.</p>

<p>How does one flatten the curve? To put the same question another way, how does one prevent hospitals and healthcare workers from being overwhelmed by high numbers of COVID cases? One does so by enacting social distancing measures, like shut downs, in order to reduce the rate at which the virus spreads and thus to keep the number of cases low. Reducing the rate at which the virus spreads is synonymous with stopping the spread. So, the goal of flattening the curve is consistent with, and is essentially the same as, the ultimate goal of reducing the spread of COVID in order to save lives. People who ask ‚Äúwhatever happened to flatten the curve‚Äù must fail to realize the fact that flattening the curve is just a particular practical example of stopping the spread.</p>
<p>Herd immunity had been floated as a goal, but this method would be deadly, and scientists don‚Äôt think it would even work (https://m.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/us-infectious-disease-expert-darkest-yet-to-come_uk_5f8d3325c5b62dbe71c45552?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMZhfqNO6PqPdApt8NZDmtgNAfE2ogYmzPsZns5O8dh9VNHcfaD6BCWcWCFACQ-u8c4-dhnQGS1fOR-9AIK4UVPg9v_dYhE7S6mLVTGdO60VAKjkeun_nHFad7RcUwD5IJvADtNX51mugqsq4BAouJQII2hTHaUYjAjOiojw1UZ5). It‚Äôs been my understanding that a vaccine, or some other type of cure, would be necessary before it would be safe to lift social distancing measures. One big problem is that some politicians, including Boris Johnson and Donald Trump, haven‚Äôt always listened to the advice and guidance of public health experts on COVID. This has led to further confusion among the population and, oftentimes, to further distrust in the government and distrust in experts by many members of the population. Johnson, rightfully, got a lot of pushback for advocating for a herd immunity strategy, which would be deadly and would require an unnecessary loss of human lives (see https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/herd-immunity-is-a-fatal-strategy-we-should-avoid-at-all-costs).</p>
<p>&rt;All i can say with respect to value judgements is that if sacrificing 10 yrs off the end of my life was what was needed to ensure my children continued to enjoy all the freedoms i‚Äôve lost this past year then it would be a price i‚Äôd gladly pay. I would even go so far as to say that anyone unwilling to risk similar sacrifices was themselves being selfish.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve already explained to you how temporary shut down measures do not constitute permanently lost freedoms. I won‚Äôt explain again that you‚Äôve already seen your country lift certain shut down measures when it was safe enough to do so. Stop sensationalizing the shut downs to such an absurd degree when you have no evidence that any of these measures will be permanent. </p>
<p>You saying that you would sacrifice ten years off your life to prevent shut down measures from ever having gone into effect is tantamount to you saying that you‚Äôd sacrifice ten years off of your life to ensure that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of more people would have died of COVID. I hope you can recognize how morally abhorrent a statement that would be to make.</p>
<p>&rt;Where i was going with the ‚Äòalternative circumstance‚Äô was to try and make our relative positions objectively falsifiable. Mine is falsified by things being normal by next Christmas, what would falsify yours? We can‚Äôt have an ‚Äòunless n amount of people are still dying‚Äô clause, because everyone dies of something that is usually, at least in the short term, preventable. e.g. you could argue fatty foods are a humanitarian crisis and have the numbers to back it up.</p>
<p>Your equivocation of COVID to fatty foods is nonsensical, as these health issues are completely different in terms of how they are caused and how they spread. Eating fatty foods is not contagious. If I eat too many hamburgers and harden my arteries, and go to a restaurant, it‚Äôs impossible for the other restaurant patrons to contract hardened arteries by breathing the same air as me. The same cannot be said of COVID. If heart disease, or diarrhea, or whatever other health issue you might substitute as an example, were as contagious as COVID was, then you might have a point. They‚Äôre not, though, so your point is nonsensical. </p>
<p>I will also dismantle your fatty foods example from another angle. I‚Äôm sure you can find scientists or dietitians who are in favor of banning the sale of fatty foods, as doing so would likely prevent many people from dying of heart disease. However, those who eat such foods excessively are only harming their own health. No matter how many burgers I eat, it will never cause another person to have heart disease. The same cannot be said of a contagious virus like COVID. Someone who fails to comply with social distancing measures is more likely to develop COVID, but unlike someone with calcified arteries, the person with COVID has the potential of passing COVID onto someone else, which can deadly consequences.</p>
<p>And if you‚Äôre planning to ask why we don‚Äôt then shut down society over the flu, since the flu is also a contagious virus, the answer is this: because the flu is not a novel virus, and we already have a vaccine for the flu. A vaccine is basically the best feasible tool to prevent the spread of the flu that we‚Äôre ever going to get. Once the COVID vaccine is widely available, there will still be instances of people getting sick of and dying of COVID, just like people still get sick from and die of the flu. However, far less people will die of COVID once the vaccine does become widely available. Shut downs are necessary so that we can stop as many people as dying from COVID as possible while we work on a vaccine. As I‚Äôve already shown you, the number of lives saved due to shut downs is at least in the hundreds of thousands, if not in the millions, and I would say that a temporary shut down is worth it to save that amount of lives. </p>
<p>&rt;What circumstance would make you admit that our concerns about restrictions are not misguided?</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say that we come to a time when pandemic has subsided, and public health experts have assessed the best evidence available to them and advise that the shut down measures are no longer necessary to prevent the spread of COVID (i.e. the experts advise that lifting shut down measures will not lead to an unacceptably high amount of preventable COVID deaths). If, in such a case, the government is still restricting people from leaving their homes without an excuse and is still limiting the number of people who can be in a restaurant at a given time, despite the fact that such measures were no longer considered by the experts to be efficacious, then I would agree that your concerns are not misguided. </p>
<p>Let me present you with a metaphor for the COVID situation that I hope will make clear a fatal flaw that I‚Äôve described in your reasoning on this issue:</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say a hurricane was coming through your town, and you decide to protect yourself and your family by going into a basement shelter. A bit of time passes. If you are making a decision of whether or not you and your family should now leave the shelter, which of the following two factors are more important to consider?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>whether not not the hurricane is still active, i.e. whether or not it will be safe to leave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether or not I feel like being stuck in a shelter is a violation of my freedom to not be inside of a shelter</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you rely entirely on factor 2 to make your decision while completely ignoring factor 1, then you‚Äôre likely to put yourself and your family in harm‚Äôs way. Now, replace ‚Äúhurricane‚Äù with ‚ÄúCOVID pandemic‚Äù and replace ‚Äúleave shelter‚Äù with ‚Äúend the shut down.‚Äù</p>

        <p>‚Äòflatten the curve‚Äô implied definitive temporality. The curve was flattened back in June, here we still are.</p>
<p>The Guardian article gets it epically wrong even by Guardian standards. Herd immunity is not a ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô, it‚Äôs an end result of <em>every</em> strategy or even no strategy at all. Dismissing the idea of protecting the vulnerable while the ‚Äòyoung‚Äô go on as normal by saying ‚Äòthat‚Äôs not how society works‚Äô is laughable considering the state we are in. Particularly when the chances of dying vary 10000 fold according to age.</p>
<p>‚ÄòExperts‚Äô do not speak with a unified voice. They never have, and anyone claiming to be led by <em>the</em> experts gives themselves away as being agenda led. It seems strange that normal people are in the position of having to weigh up differing scientific opinions, but here we are. I tentatively go with these guys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz_Z7Gf1aRE </p>
<p>Fatty foods was just an example (ok, a bad example) of something with a death toll, not a comparison. Ye got me, I was going to go with seasonal flu too. Even global warming, which we‚Äôre told is to have an epic death toll.</p>
<p>Point is, your spectacular death stats are misleading. Only a tiny <em>tiny</em> % of corona deaths are 100% corona. If an obese 88yr old dies of corona then their death was probably 40% obesity, 50% old age and 10% corona. Change those %s if you like, but the fact remains, <em>everyone dies of something</em>, hence the fatty foods example. This is why I spoke of sacrificing years off the <em>end</em> off my life. That is how this disease works. It increases your mortality by a factor of 1. https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3259</p>
<p>Hurricane example is illuminating. Sure i‚Äôd wait out the hurricane, but only up to a point. If somehow global warming gave us extended or even perpetual hurricanes then yes, i would at some point except the risk rather than live out my days in a shelter. Nature has certainly given us a perpetual supply of contagions, so the example is apt.</p>
<p>Perhaps the difference between our positions is how we view <em>responsibility</em>. You believe people spreading disease are the aggressors. I believe the ultimate responsibility for <em>your</em> health rests with <em>you</em>, not other people. If you are vulnerable to corona and you catch it that‚Äôs <em>your</em> fault. Not those breaking lockdown, not those without masks, but you. If you didn‚Äôt want to get it then <em>you</em> should have self isolated. I know life is not always so easy, so we should indeed help these people isolate if they choose. But the responsibility for their health should not be born by others.</p>

        <p>The point is, if you go out of your way to ignore public safety recommendations and put people‚Äôs lives at risk (including and especially the lives of local healthcare workers), then you risk alienating the very healthcare workers you depend on. If I was a nurse, I‚Äôd rather work in a place where people take communicable disease seriously than a place where I‚Äôm more likely to A) be exposed to the virus because more people in that area were deliberately acting without precaution, and B) end or sour their relationships with me over professional public health advice that I share in the interest of people‚Äôs safety.</p>
<p>There are real examples of authoritarianism in the US (or whatever other country you could be from, more likely than not), but expert-recommended, temporary lifestyle changes that are implemented to stop the spread of a virus in order to save lives is not a real example of authoritarianism. </p>
<p>Sometimes, you need to listen to the advice of the experts and make inconvenient changes to their lifestyles for the good of the community, i.e. for the good of other humans. If anyone is suffering economically as a result of safety measures - such as those who have lost their jobs due to shut downs, for instance - then they are suffering because our government has failed to provide them with adequate financial relief. Social distancing and shut downs are important tools, but our government cannot allow these tools to bring common people to bankruptcy. We must demand an adequate stimulus from the government, and we must demand that the stimulus include things like strong unemployment benefits.</p>

        <p>People have a right to go to places like the grocery store and hospitals without worrying about catching a potentially deadly virus. People have a right to do things like learn from their teacher and attend court without worrying about catching a deadly virus. It‚Äôs the government‚Äôs responsibility to do as much as possible to ensure people‚Äôs right to safety and life in these ways. You have no right to put others at risk by recklessly ignoring the advice of public health experts. The government is, at least theoretically, chosen by the people and beholden to the interests of the people. If the government advises shut downs, then they have every right to do so, as that is the will of the people. In addition to that, the government has the responsibility to prevent financial ruin from coming to those who must stop working as a result of lockdowns.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not a violation of rights to enforce public safety by preventing jackasses from behaving recklessly and putting other people‚Äôs lives at risk. That‚Äôs why drunk driving is illegal, for example.</p>
<p>Edit: forgot to reply to this part:</p>
<p>&rt;No, sometimes I don't. They will be replaced.</p>
<p>No, they won‚Äôt be. They‚Äôre not being replaced fast enough, anyway. That‚Äôs a big part of why rural healthcare is crumbling.</p>

        <p>Then take the virus to court for violating your life.</p>
<p>I don't have the virus so you have no legal leg to stand on, further, you would have to provide undeniable evidence that we interacted, that I had covid 19 when we interacted, and that you did not have it, AND that it killed you.</p>
<p>I also have the liberty to not wear a mask.</p>
<p>Since a grocery store can refuse you service for any reason, you do not have any right to go to a grocery store.</p>

        <p>All rights are human inventions. We can create, and enforce, any rights that we so choose. The right to the highest possible attainable standard of health, as I‚Äôve described it, is essential to any healthy and just society. </p>
<p>There are people who would say that humans have no right to clean water, people who would, when given the opportunity, hoard the world‚Äôs supply of water and refuse to provide it to those who couldn‚Äôt pay, regardless of how many deaths that would bring. It is up to the people to decide what our rights are, and it is up to the government we elect to ensure that those rights will not be violated.</p>

        <p>I do have those rights, and so do you. The social distancing measures and shut down measures are examples of one of those rights being enforced by the government. Cry about it all you want. </p>
<p>But if you don‚Äôt believe that humans should have a right to clean water, you are either a heartless sociopath or suffer from an imagination too limited to envision and to help create a world in which people actually look out for one another and care for one another.</p>

<p>You have the right to decide if YOU want to wear a mask or not.</p>

        <p>The people in this article remind me of the cops who  snicker about how BLM protesters will be crying for police when someone gets murdered, but the police won't be there, haha... essentially refusing to do their jobs out of spite at the beliefs of the people in the neighborhoods they "serve and protect"... something I suspect happened this year in Chicago. </p>
<p>If you are a healthcare worker who is doing this and trumpeting to the media how no one should provide healthcare to the people in the town you deserted, then you are a despicable person who should not be working in healthcare. It's like refusing to treat someone for lung cancer because they smoked, or refusing to treat someone for AIDS because they had sex bareback or injected drugs, except that there's far less evidence for lack of masks being the reason people get infected with covid, so really it's more like refusing to treat someone who doesn't believe in your religion.</p>
