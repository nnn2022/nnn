        <p>What has really made me lose faith lately is all the people shaming each other and snitching on their neighbours. It is insane. Good to know that fear will make people behave in the most inhumane and irrational ways. People in my city are getting $2,300 fines for having a few people over to their house and their neighbours are the ones calling it in.</p>

        <p>Cancel culture was already a plague on society even before this. People need to mind their own fucking business in general. I don’t understand why that’s such a difficult concept for them to understand. If there’s like a violent disturbance going on at your neighbors house it makes sense to call the police but in that instance it’s about trying to prevent harm and actually looking out for your neighbors rather than shaming and fucking with them. I’ve lost faith in humanity too.</p>

        <p>Remember when Animal Farm and 1984 seemed absurd and like it could NEVER happen?</p>
<p>I scoffed in HS.  Refused to read 1984 on the required reading list - we had other choices and I can't remember what I chose instead, maybe Last of the Mohicans, but 1984 seemed so laughable to me, I wouldn't read it... until last winter at the age of 46.  I'm not laughing now.</p>

        <p>Frankly, if it seemed absurd, that just means people never read history or paid attention.</p>
<p>When I first read 1984, I was amazed at how similar it was to what happened in Venezuela, my parents’ home country. And now I am even more amazed and terrified at how both stories are becoming real.</p>

        <p>I'm not fighting or trolling anyone. I got suggested this thread by Reddit, I looked at it and checked the comments and simply replied my opinion. Your reaction to this simple chain of events is to attack my character, life choices and everything else you could squeeze in a reply while knowing nothing about me. I don't care what others do with their time (or that others even exist) unless it directly impacts my life. And people not following quarantine has an impact on my life, so I expressed support to those particular individuals that report such selfish and dangerous behaviour.</p>

        <p>This is not a one off, this is every MSM narrative. The only thing special about covid is the scale. They control public opinion like a volume knob, turning it up and down at will. Such as how they turned covid down overnight to make way for the race riots, an equivalent bit of insanity, and now are turning that down to turn covid back up. </p>
<p>The entire history of the news has been one long string of completely manufactured and false narratives. Constant panics, one after the other. For instance the esteemed doctor Fauci, during the AIDs panic, was assuring us that millions and millions of people would die. Something like 1 in 10? And he promoted a drug called AZT which in fact began pushing us down that route as it was far worse than the disease itself, similar to now promoting lockdown and ventilators to juice the death numbers.</p>
<p>Even if you go back to look at, say, the propaganda used to get us into WWI and WWII it was similar mass lies and calculated fearmongering. This is all nothing new although the scale and idiocy of it are.</p>

        <p>That's a good point, especially about the WW I&amp;II. People keep referring to those as "just wars" or "real wars". Especially the II is supposed to be a classic good vs evil black &amp; white scenario. Infact  the truth is a lot more complicated and as always there was a benefactor and orchestrators to the ordeal.</p>

        <p>Hi! I'm a career psychologist out of Boston. The reality is, people hate themselves after a certain point of perceived self-failure. </p>
<p>It's like emotional debt. After a certain point, personal growth becomes less of an incentive and they just default to being pieces of shit while insisting they aren't. I wish I were joking. I have a masters in psych and have worked here for 7 years and people are all the same. If I weren't paid insanely well I'd live in a cave. I'll probably retire to one. </p>
<p>The only thing more terrifying than the average person's lack of self-awareness is the elite's intentionally manipulation OF that.</p>

        <p>&rt; It's very unfortunate how something like a overhyped flu virus and the fearmongering from the MSM made everyone lose their critical thinking and logical mindset </p>
<p>These people lost their critical thinking long before this overhyped flu virus. It's just that most of us only started noticing it recently, because it's become much more obvious now.</p>

        <p>I've been pondering selling my car and just using the money for something else. I work from home now, thanks to the scamdemic, and I have to work many hours to make ends meet b/c I'm now a gig economy member, and I earn much less than I did in my profession. I don't drive my car more than once per week, and only to get groceries.</p>
<p>It's winter here. There is nowhere I can go without a mask, and there is no one I want to see. </p>
<p>It really struck me that I could be carless and it totally would not matter. To think back to just 9 months ago, how different life was...it's crazy. I am utterly disillusioned as far as wanting to bond with anyone who is still falling for this bs in any way. I'm alone and I think it's going to be that way for most of 2021, the way things are going.</p>

        <p>If anything it has made me really understand how all the great dictators like mao, Lenin, Stalin, hitler and all the more modern ones.. came into power. Like how it really really happened. Normal people just complied like sheeples and believed every lie. The fanatics has the biggest bull horn and kept reciting whatever their dear leader told them.

        <p>This is the worst part of all of it for me. I am losing respect for people I have known for years. The mass stupidity is mind blowing. I have moved out to the woods where I talk to trees more than people because I just can't stand watching what is happening.</p>

        <p>History has shown us this over and over, but there is a difference between reading about it in single, flat dimension and living it in all them.</p>
<p>We all now have the complete perspective. </p>
<p>So the historical events were not 'one off' events as one would believe when seen in a single dimension, but actual every day human behavior.</p>

        <p>&rt;When I was a child, I used to believe humanity had intellect, critical thought and wisdom</p>
<p>We had... or at least our leaders and leading intellectuals had. If you read books from the 1920s, you will often find a combo of critical thinking and wisdom way beyond what one can witness today among leaders and intellectuals alike.</p>
<p>"Democracy" &amp; corporate interests corrupted our political leaders. And politics corrupted our intellectuals. And now we live in a clown world, where critical thinking &amp; wisdom have become exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>Society is being destroyed in front of our eyes as a consequence of a mixture of great corruption and great incompetence. And the longer we wait to stand up, the less there will be left to save!</p>

        <p>Sincerely i ask: why do i should think im actually smarter than a whole bunch of experts on any matter? Especially since all i seem to have to support my views are not peer to peer revised academic articles? Not saying that scientific knowledge is the only form of knowledge but in this particular case why wouldnt scientific evidence be considered stronger than anedoctal ones?</p>

        <p>Individual people have intellect, critical thought and wisdom the problem is when you put people in a crowd they lose those abilities. </p>
<p>Now that the crazies are winning with their socialism/communism it makes the country 1 big crowd instead of a collection of individuals. Thought and reason get laid to waste.</p>

        <p>you know in the soviet union they actually had elections for some time before the collapse and the idiots still voted for communists</p>
<p>Russia could have kept all their land and been saved from collapse, but no. They were too afraid the spooky capitalists would get them that they preferred starving and being paid in bread.</p>
<p>That says enough about human intellect</p>
