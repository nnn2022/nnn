        <p>Costco used to leave you alone if you said you couldn't wear a mask. But now they require that you wear another form of muzzle if you don't want to wear the other type. </p>
<p>Boycott these bastards please, everyone.</p>

        <p>Not a problem at all. I had a membership years ago to Costco and got rid of it. Costco is the most annoying place to shop at and I really disliked how they checked your receipt and cart before you leave the store like you are a criminal. Not to mention, they were the first to jump on the mask bandwagon.</p>

        <p>I also disliked their absolute refusal to provide any sort of carry baskets or provide express or self-checkout services for us single types who were only grabbing a few items.</p>
<p>Nothing like waiting half an hour behind Welfare Wilma with 2 full cartloads when you have half a dozen items. And of course, God forbid she lets you go first!</p>

        <p>The Costcos here were some of the first businesses to jump on the face diaper bandwagon. And even pre-Corona, I didn't shop there much (other than gas) because they were home to the most obnoxious, oblivious, rude, entitled Karens on the planet. If there was any place I would expect to get into a confrontation over masks in my area, Costco would be it.</p>
<p>Think the welfare mother clientele of Walmart, with an extra helping of entitlement fuelled by "I paid for a membership here!"</p>
<p>I haven't set foot in the place since last February, and won't be renewing my membership.</p>

        <p>The fact that nobody cares about people with disabilities is just beyond me.</p>
<p>I cannot wear a mask properly for a variety of reasons — I have a debilitating fear of not being able to breathe, to the point that I can’t wear turtlenecks without holding it away from my throat the entire day. I also get anxiety attacks that can cause me to be unable to breathe and pass out. In addition, I have language processing disorder, and having to communicate to people in masks while also in a mask is like being thrown into a foreign country where you don’t speak the language. It is scary and frustrating. If I don’t wear a mask myself, I am able to understand people 50% better which makes functioning in the world easier. I am always telling people to either speak louder or to pull their masks down so I can see their lips move while they talk, otherwise I don’t understand most people.</p>
<p>So when I do have to wear a mask, like at my job, I wear it in a way that doesn’t make it impossible to breathe — I put the bottom part on the middle of my chin so the mask sits away from my face and gives me a pocket to breathe in. My mouth and nose is then technically covered.</p>

        <p>Yes, they threw asthmatics and claustrophobes under the bus, and the crowd cheered. It's disgusting, and in urban areas, it's commonplace, which should tell one something fairly disturbing about urban culture.</p>
<p>As an asthmatic (with chronic bronchitis and rhinitis aggravated by black mold exposure), I'd purely love to boycott all of the companies doing this, but, regrettably, if I did that at the moment, I'd starve. Every food store I can find is doing this same thing. What I had to do was wait for a few weeks until my keffiyehs arrived through the mail. Some of us have been wearing them as if they were bandannas, because they pass more air through the fabric, itself, and because they're easier to breathe through than those surgical masks. Wearing one of those, I would get dizzy in under a minute.</p>
<p>The position of Jewel foods was that this was my problem, and that of Potash Brothers (a small local grocery store chain) was that having asthma made one an "a**hole" and that asthmatics weren't welcome in their store. If that sounds like a blatant violation of the ADA, it is, but the government doesn't care about that, any more. There is a moral panic going, and our civil servants have only so much time to cash in on it. So, some of us got to go without food for the two weeks Amazon needed to get those not-quite-masks delivered to us.</p>
<p>They make <em>some</em> difference, but not enough. I can last a few minutes instead of one before starting to pass out, but I still have to sneak into aisles where nobody is looking, slip my hand under my keffiyeh as discretely as I can, and loosen the thing so I can breathe. I'll do this a few times during a trip to the store, hoping not to get caught (so far, so good, but it's just a matter of time, I know). Even so, I come out with lungs burning, and a disturbing realization.</p>
<p>I'm losing ground. There has been a marked deterioration of lung function, over the last few months. At first, I'd be winded until I got home, two blocks away. Then, until after I took the elevator up, and then, each day for a little longer. I don't have enough time to recover from what is being done to me until I have to go through it, again, just to get more food. I'm now short of breath, constantly, just to varying degrees at different times of day, and it's getting worse.</p>
<p>But try to explain this to people, and at best, I'll get a glib, dismissive "we all have to do our part," usually from somebody in his 20s who will then tell me how scared he is that Covid will kill him. Even though, as a factual matter, his risk is low, and that this constant strain on our longs is not a tiny risk for us. The CDC has said as much, listing breathing problems as a reason for a mask exemption.</p>
<p>I'm truly learning to not merely dislike, but to actually hate my neighbors. I can't wait to move out of Chicago, permanently, and to never step foot in a large city again, if I can help it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Once I'm in a place where people tend to be better at acting like human beings, maybe I'll start boycotting CostCo, again, even if the CEO undoes and condemns the policy, puts on sackcloth and ashes, and drops to his knees begging for forgiveness from every American with impaired breathing. When people are treated like this, that should never been forgiven. Having taken part in something like this, somebody should find that his own outrageous behavior will follow him around until the day he dies. Such people are beyond redemption.</p>
