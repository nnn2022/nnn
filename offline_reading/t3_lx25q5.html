    <strong>Not forgetting</strong>
    <p><p>As mandates (appear) to be declining throughout the country, I believe it is important to stay vigilant and keep up the pressure. Continue to protest and make noise, call governors' offices, etc.</p>
<p>I believe, even if the mandates go away, we need to remember the businesses that were Nazis about masks. If you are able, continue to boycott these businesses. I think we should, even after the mandates end, patronize businesses that were non-enforcing during the mandates. </p>
<p>I know a Goodwill store in my city, where I walked in last week. I was holding my rosary in one hand, because I was on a walk and wanted to get my 15 decades done for the day. I entered the store, without a mask, and an employee belittled the Catholic Church, to my face, and swore at me, and I left, after arguing with him for a few minutes, loudly. Before I left I shouted so everyone in the store could hear: Covid is a hoax! Then I walked home.</p>
<p>Will I go back to that store? Probably not. Not without complaining to the management for the horrid behavior of their employees. Definitely I will always remember this, even after the mandates end.</p></p>
