        <p>I imagine that 2020, if people are being honest, can be remembered as a year of lies.</p>
<p>Not that most years aren't filled with lies, but this year has the biggest, life affecting whoppers in my lifetime.</p>

        <p>All those negative tests that were poorly designed to give misleading results.  You need zinc.  Half the tests didn't have zinc in them.  How stupid can you be?  The inventor of the protocol said you need zinc.</p>
<p>They tested 2x the safe dose and people died but no zinc so we conclude its too dangerous and doesn't work.  No one is that dumb.  It was willful.</p>

        <p>The American Medical Association has been adamantly against hydroxychloroquine as a therapeutic for COVID for the past year. Just a few days before the presidential election they reversed course, reversing their opposition. Did they suddenly realize HCQ might have benefit in certain patient groups or were they lying for the past year? How many individuals died as a result of being denied potential lifesaving treatment?</p>
<p>No, we knew this the whole time...</p>

        <p>Additional information - Dr. Meryl Nass has uncovered a hornet’s nest of government sponsored Hydroxychloroquine experiments that were designed to kill severely ill, Covid-19 hospitalized patients. On June 14th Dr. Nass first identified two Covid-19 experiments in which massive, high toxic doses – four times higher than usual of hydroxychloroquine were being given to severely ill hospitalized patients in intensive care units.

        <p>Politics will be the death of medicine, which is very sad because we have come a long way in medical advancement. We are able to cure and treat once thought to be incurable or untreatable illnesses, prolong life, etc. People are going to start losing trust in medicine.</p>
