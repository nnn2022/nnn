    <strong>Boris attempts coup</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1380297/lockdown-uk-end-date-tier-4-coronavirus-rules-restrictions-tier-5-latest-boris-johnson">Lockdown until March 31: Small print in legislation shows shut down set to last MONTHS | UK | News | Express.co.uk</a> </p>
<p>Lockdown secretly extended in sudden law, with suggestions of May - three times the publicly-claimed February date! - unless the vaccine 'rollout' is successful. But here's the thing: government has <em>deliberately messed up</em> the vaccine 'rollout,' including declining small pharmacies and splitting the doses to the point <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9117839/Coronavirus-refuses-UKs-Covid-vaccine-dose-spacing.html">even the WHO and Pfizer think they don't work</a>.</p>
<p>Surely even the most trusting, naive, milkthistle apparatchiks can see the contradictory and put two and two together? How can you trust someone who point-blank does nothing they say?</p>
<p>This is the same government whose response to the new mutant super-COVID mega-spreading uberplague was delayed by <em>three months</em> - after its discovery in September - until the day after parliament broke for Christmas, meaning there was no vote or scrutiny of the Cabinet or their science.</p></p>

        <p>The reason there has never been a vaccine against this type of virus is that it mutates too quickly for us to keep up. It's how viruses adapt to thrive in an environment.</p>
<p>It's why flu vaccines aren't very effective, and change every year.</p>
<p>The "medical professionals" know this, but there is too much money to be made, too much political power to be usurped, and a compliant and stupid populace - so the charade goes on.</p>

        <p>I feel bad for you guys.  You need to boil that potato.</p>
<p>Why are there so many issues with the vaccine roll out?  Same is happening here in Ontario.  Why would govts be deliberately botching the roll out?  Something I'm missing?</p>

        <p>And in Germany, too. They're acting against 'the science' and the WHO to make sure the vaccines are effectively spoiled. The only reason I can think of is because they want to continue lockdowns: if people aren't vaccinated properly, they can drag them on longer. They've been saying for a year we can go back to 'normal' when we all take the jab, and that's either not true or governments don't want it to be.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, some class clown is going around downvoting <em>all</em> the comments. How much of a scrub do you have to be to go up to people outlining government malfeascence and say, "yes - I <em>will</em> support my betters! I am going to make a trivial dent on your honour on an Internet forum! That'll show you!"</p>

        <p>It was "botched" from day 1 - because they knew all along it wouldn't work. At least not to bring the ScamDemic under control.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's worked very well to enrich the elites, allow the indefinite use of rule by decree, and destroy and divide Western societies.</p>
<p>And mass refusal of the fake vaccine will simply be the pretext for more draconian measures; governments have learned very quickly that they can do as they please and that the threat of a citizen revolt is almost nil.</p>

        <p>Yep, the day before he introduced one. Schools were open that day on the promise they would remain open throughout spring. At 8pm, he shut them. It's not incompetence because U-turns like this have been constant since September: it's deliberately wrong-footing opposition.</p>

        <p>Probably to cancel elections. Local elections will likely see a Tory wipe out that will demonstrate lack of consent for lockdowns. They won't want that happening and will deem them 'unsafe'</p>
