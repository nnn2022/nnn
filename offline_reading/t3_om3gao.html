    <strong>The gradual decline of self sufficient resources and skills. Coincidence or orchestration?</strong>
    <p><p>When you look or talk to the older generation (past encounters or  currently living today) many grew up in a time that didn't rely on  supermarkets or mass manufacturing of products and services to survive.  Without those things, people were more self sufficient. This could be  seen as a 'threat' to globalists. Has anyone noticed this and do you  think it was due to a multitude of factors (by random) or a cunning plan  to control?</p></p>

        <p>It is a real development that works on many levels. There is a group of people behind the scenes who plan all day how they can enslave everyone. In order to get closer to that goal, they rely on a managerial and business class that is systemically coerced into supporting this agenda. At the bottom of our illuminati pyramid is the consumer who could change everything by simply awakening and building a better system.</p>
