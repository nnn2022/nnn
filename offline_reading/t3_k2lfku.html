    <strong>I NEED to vent. CW: suicide (not personally me)</strong>
    <p><p>I am SO  angry. Warning: discussion of suicide</p>
<p>I work with people. Suicide was always far away. Sure, there was discussion about suicidal thoughts etc, but it mostly just helped people to vent and to share, so that they didn't feel so alone or stigmatized. </p>
<p>And here's the thing...</p>
<p>A woman I worked with, ended her own life. I'm dealing with the aftermath and supporting the other people who knew her. Another woman, a volunteer where I work, made an attempt. She'd been in the hospital for a week. Colleagues say that more and more people are talking about suicide.</p>
<p>The woman who passed was 34. I think of her voice, her mannerisms, her face. She was exactly right the way she was, a beautiful, unique person, smart, strong.</p>
<p>I can't help it... I think it's coincidence that the subject of suicide (not a native speaker) is suddenly coming so close. One attempt, one successful suicide, more and more people talking about having such feelings....</p>
<p>This is no coincidence and it makes me SO angry. So, so angry. Those who support this madness to ''save'' those whose time left on this earth is counted only in months, sacrifice those who have decades left ahead of them. People feeling SUCH hopelesness, loneliness, pointlesness, young people, it's insane. It's a horrible, monstrous, sickening crime. How can you look yourself in the eyes while thinking this is worth it? People are struggling really badly. It's nauseating and I'm so angry.</p>
<p>Also, there'll be a mask mandate next December. It makes me feel SICK. I think it's a disgusting crime. Just yesterday I wanted to enter a store and they forced this thing on me. I just walked out because I CAN'T STAND it. I hate it, I refuse it, I want to keep these tyrants away from my body. I don't believe in it, it's tyrannical, it's disgusting, it's driving people to utter hopelesness, it's none of their fucking business what I wear on my face.</p>
<p>I really needed to vent to people who may understand my anger because I'm surrounded by people who reiterate the same dumb bullshit about this joke virus and hospital capacity. Fuck off. You know what also puts pressure on hospitals? Suicide attempts. These people want to sacrifice lives. These people support such horrible destruction. They support horrible tyrannical rules that infringe upon basic human dignity.</p></p>

        <p>"Flatten the curve" indeed - </p>
<p>a short, acute peak of illness and death (if their claims are to be belived),</p>
<p>versus ...</p>
<p>an indefinite prison sentence for all of society, everybody slowly wasting away in isolation, family and neighbors pitted against each other over imagined moral transgressions, losing their livelihoods, being forced to suck at the government teat to survive</p>
<p>but at least the hospitals aren't full, amirite?</p>

        <p>Fucking hospitals. Those things are meant to <em>increase</em> health and life, not to be such a burden on society that they and their shitty stupid capacity numbers <em>cost</em> endless health and life.</p>
<p>I'd hoped that during summer, my government of where I live would work very hard to increase capacity for a ''second wave'' (which I knew was BS, but anyway. Weren't those ''2 weeks'' meant to buy some time? Summer gave a ton of time)  but instead, not much changed, and everyone gets to suffer. (not that I think that ''hospital capacity'' is a valid reason to destroy society)</p>

        <p>Suicide is up around me too. My boyfriend of 8 years has told me he’s suicidal. I’ve been having dark thoughts myself lately, can’t seem to crawl out of a pit that is only worsening because of everything going on. Most of our friends are service industry and encounters with them are all sad and hopeless too. Drinking is done to numb ourselves. </p>
<p>Whatever I’m ranting. Up and can’t sleep, just sitting here intermittently sobbing. </p>
<p>I feel what you’re saying.</p>

        <p>I wish I could help somehow, somehow make you feel better. If you want to PM, you're welcome to do so. I hope that you and your BF soon find some light and hope, some relief from this misery. I've also been struggling myself, not suicidal, but really, things are getting so difficult, aren't they?</p>

        <p>My little brother took his own life a month ago. He was a bartender in Las Vegas. We're not sure why he did it, but a lot points to some work place drama and alcoholism. Apparently he was heavily invested in his job and his boss put out a nasty rumor on Facebook about him. Not sure if 2020 events were a factor too.</p>

        <p>A first we were devastated and I found out 10 minutes before clocking on to my shift. But a couple days afterward my Dad and I were pretty mad at him, it's such a selfish act. He could have reached out to us, said something, anything. But what's done is done, you can't reverse it, death is final. I've been going through a really rough year myself (probably the worst in my life) and my parents are always calling me now and telling me not lose hope. But I have two boys, I could never do that to them, I want to always be there for them no matter what. I'm the kind of person that if I hit rock bottom and life was too hard to handle, I would just hitch hike across America or go live in the forest like that Into the Wild movie.</p>

        <p>I stopped taking a life saving medicine that I require about 3 months ago. I'm just waiting to die naturally now (hopefully very soon) because I can't live in this world anymore. Everything is a lie and we're never going back to normal. I can't live in this new world, this new abnormal. I have a solid medical background and know that this is all a lie and antiscience. They're relying on the fact that most people don't have a medical background and trying to silence us who do. I know we're in a more secular society now, but for those who have faith in God, we see where this is heading and why it's happening. It's only going to get worse from here and I'm simply not strong enough to handle this anymore. I broke down and starting sobbing yesterday after going to petco and seeing this precious young child in a mask and he acted like it was so normal to be in his mask. My heart broke for him. I can't even leave my house anymore because I feel like I'm living in a nightmare when I see everyone wearing a mask everywhere I go. I'm already feeling the effects of not taking my meds and every morning that I'm still here is making me so sad.</p>

        <p>I know I'm just a random stranger on the internet, but please know that your life has value. Things may seem impossibly hard right now, but if you manage to keep going, there will be moments that make you so glad you did. Is there someone in your life you can reach out to about what you are feeling, a family member, friend, or pastor?

        <p>My heart goes out to you. Like u/Cool-Village-8208 said, you're precious, your life has so much value. I don't know where you live, but I'm sure there must be help out there. I get it. The masks everywhere, that they're mandated, it's horrible, dystopian and wrong and goes against our human rights. Is there anyone in your life to whom you could talk, vent and cry? You matter,  and it's so wrong if the good people feel inclined to leave this increasingly sick world.</p>

        <p>Remember someone did this to you. Maybe a politician, maybe a police officer, maybe a health administrator or maybe someone who felt they needed to control you and for whatever reason had the authority to.</p>
<p>Before you take your own life consider and dwell on that thought for a moment.</p>

        <p>I'm someone with a lot of drive to live and even I've been feeling it, the fact there is no end in sight. No breaks, no going out anymore, nothing to look forward to as I desperately try to find new things to do but that's running out. It does make me feel sick being in public now, it's so overwhelming now. I just left a place too cause I don't even have one on me and I'm not doing it besides where at work because if I don't I'll have no money at all and then things would really be shit. </p>
<p>As were in ranting territory anyways something happened there that made it so dumb I actually thought about quitting. So my boss brings up a bunch that press and seal stuff (the not plastic wrap but semi transparent foam like stuff) and I ask what he's doing and he wraps the whole keyboard and pin pad in this stuff. I was so confused, I asked if he just messing around because now I can barely even type fast enough or accurately resulting in stupid long lines and us looking like absolute idiots as the people pile up because we keep making typing mistakes. But no this is real and apparently what they were told to do. This is psychotic, what is this protecting us from? We're still touching everything anyways! Brain can not compute.</p>

        <p>The thing with mind-numbingly dumb restrictions is that they're also extra humiliating to follow. It's an insult.</p>
<p>And I feel likewise... I'm not suicidal, and I too have a drive to live, but it's just as you describe-- endless, pointless, meaningless, with nothing to look forward to, with increasingly tyrannical and controlling rules. I try to find and shine my inner light, but it's a challenge to say the least. Hang in there.</p>

        <p>Same here. Oh man the humiliation of it at work, it's so degrading. You lose so much self expression covering and the nose and mouth and I am an extremely expressive person. So in even trying to be anything more than this cold, nearly emotionless robot only makes you look more ridiculous and creepy. Whenever I see an unmasked person and I want to express my gratitude for doing the least to stand up for themselves I feel even more shame there.</p>

        <p>It's so horrible, I know. Sometimes I wonder why I'm still here. As of the last few months I've channelled all my energy into art and plan to make some anti lockdown/mask art and stick it up wherever I go. Honestly from what I can see more people are waking up, and this sub reminds me I'm not alone too! I wish you the best, and remember that there are people out there ready to fight with you! ❤️</p>

<p>I know that is your first instinct and it makes sense, but try to channel that anger into helping others, as always.</p>
