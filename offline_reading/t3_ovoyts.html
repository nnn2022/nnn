        <p>It’s like this: This pandemic happened because of a common cold virus that China pretended was a deadly plague, probably so they could subdue Hong Kong with it. The world panicked, and governments copied China implementing lockdowns. Later, blatantly obvious proof started coming out that this virus is NOT a deadly plague, but Governmnet continues to pretend it is, because dropping it would  proclaim that they got played by China, AND, the governments have used the virus excuse to exploit the economy. So with those two reasons they cannot let the pandemic end unless it’s their savior the vaccine doing it.</p>

        <p>China did lockdowns because that’s the type of thing that  China has long done. Subduing Hong Kong had nothing had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Other countries have done lockdown (and have continued lockdowns even after China itself stopped doing lockdowns) because those countries  discovered that they actually enjoyed acting like China.</p>

        <p>No, it's not whataboutism, you said the government is doing a thing, he listed multiple examples of them not doing that thing, now the burden is for you to show them doing that thing. It's like if you claimed cows were carnivorous, and he showed evidence of their digestive system being set up to handle vegetation and posted a picture of a cow eating grass, that's not whataboutism, that's evidence based arguing and now you need to provide your own evidence instead of arguing from theory</p>

        <p>You’re right, it’s weak, that’s why this is so exasperating.</p>
<p>But look: they only care about covid deaths, not people who die from car accidents, or flu, or meningitis or hepatitis or any of the dozens of other deadly viruses, and not any of the terrible things the restrictions are causing: such as the 30% increase in depression, the 13% increase in substance abuse, the suicides, all the job losses, all the businesses that ended permanently, all the people separated from loved ones abroad. This is a lot of stuff for them to turn a blind eye to. </p>
<p>Plus, it isn’t the governments job to mandate to us how to avoid getting sick from natural things like a virus, thats for people to decide individually. </p>
<p>Each person, during this pandemic, could 100% have chosen, without the government’s directions, to order a biohazard suit and wear it when needing to go out and otherwise stay home in self quarantine.</p>

        <p>I explained it, but you didn’t want to consider the narcissistic tendency for government leaders to save face and look good especially when their masses of voters are in a panicked state.</p>
<p>And another response explained the politicians are getting their campaigns paid for by big pharma as a result of forcing the population to get the vax. It may be free to you, but I assure you, pharma is making $$$ somehow, they wouldn’t develop a vaccine and distribute it en masse for free 😂</p>

        <p>Read about the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the Great Reset, these things aren't a secret. The goal of the vaccine is the vax passports which are the first step in getting the people in the west onto a digital ID/Social Credit system. That's why they are still pushing mandates and the passports despite admitting the vax doesn't stop transmission.</p>

        <p>The Davos Clique and the CCP (two of the most powerful and nefarious groups on Earth) openly talk about resetting society and fusing man with machine. They announce their agenda openly at almost every turn. They want to create a “digital wallet” which will hold every innate detail about your life and personal affairs. This wallet will be linked to a bio-imprint under the skin (Gates is calling this a Quantum Dot Tattoo, Christians are calling it the Mark of the Beast) so that you can never be separated from it and can never run from it. You will then be assigned to perform digital “tasks” on a device which is synced to a cryptocurrency server that mines a new block as your reward when you complete said task. But this cryptocurrency is not like Bitcoin; it will be completely programmable by the state. Meaning they can tell where to spend it, how to spend it, and how long you have to spend it. This is all assuming you survive the ungodly amount of toxins they’re putting in everything (graphene nanoparticles), in conjunction with the massively increased radiation coming from 5G. Hate to burst your safe space, but you’re simply not listening.</p>
<p>If you are indeed ready to listen, I can share some helpful advice for detoxing your body and returning to an organic, natural human lifestyle.</p>

        <p>&rt;The Davos Clique and the CCP (two of the most powerful and nefarious groups on Earth) openly talk about resetting society and fusing man with machine. They announce their agenda openly at almost every turn. They want to create a “digital wallet” which will hold every innate detail about your life and personal affairs. This wallet will be linked to a bio-imprint under the skin (Gates is calling this a Quantum Dot Tattoo, Christians are calling it the Mark of the Beast) so that you can never be separated from it and can never run from it. You will then be assigned to perform digital “tasks” on a device which is synced to a cryptocurrency server that mines a new block as your reward when you complete said task. But this cryptocurrency is not like Bitcoin; it will be completely programmable by the state. Meaning they can tell where to spend it, how to spend it, and how long you have to spend it. This is all assuming you survive the ungodly amount of toxins they’re putting in everything (graphene nanoparticles), in conjunction with the massively increased radiation coming from 5G. Hate to burst your safe space, but you’re simply not listening.</p>
<p>😂. Gonna respond to that later.</p>
<p>&rt;If you are indeed ready to listen, I can share some helpful advice for detoxing your body and returning to an organic, natural human lifestyle.</p>
<p>Oh do tell. What would cleanse me of the nanobots in my bloodstream?</p>

        <p>Glutathione. Its the only antioxidant that can effectively flush graphene oxide and is probably THE most powerful antioxidant that your body produces naturally. The problem is glutathione can’t be taken as a supplement or even taken directly from any one food source, you have to give your body the building blocks called “precursors” to maintain healthy glutathione production. The other problem is that stress, radiation (from our phones), and chemicals in our everyday products reduce glutathione production dramatically.</p>

        <p>Dude, the World Economic Forum has a youtube page with many videos about The Great Reset. Usually with many appearances from world leaders and heads of international monetary and financial cooperations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/WorldEconomicForum">https://www.youtube.com/user/WorldEconomicForum</a></p>
<p>Look at the Davos parts of their videos.</p>
<p>It's really peculiar how a lot of these world leaders are regurgitating the same phrases. About how Covid is a great opportunity for a reset. Using the exact phrase "Build Back Better."</p>
<p>This isn't just a Biden phrase. Boris Johnson here in the UK, Justin Trudeau up in Chinada, many others.</p>
<p>And the head of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, wrote this book...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/COVID-19-Great-Reset-Klaus-Schwab/dp/2940631123">https://www.amazon.co.uk/COVID-19-Great-Reset-Klaus-Schwab/dp/2940631123</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Plus look at the PCR testing having its emergency use authorisation revoked by the FDA because it can't differentiate between Covid and Influenza (couple that with many news articles about Flu going extinct) and it suddenly becomes impossible to say that any of those Covid positives that we've had were actually Covid.</p>
<p>That means unless you can reconcile that fact then none of your arguments have a leg to stand on. We would first even need to prove we were ever in a pandemic.</p>

        <p>For me the answers obvious: mRNA therapeutics are a promising technology with ethical concerns that the pandemic usurps.</p>
<p>If we were using vaccines launched on a more typical platform and the messaging from healthcare providers + government was more respectful there would be far fewer people concerned about what’s going on.</p>

        <p>&rt;Honestly, what do you think the government gets out of vaccinating you?</p>
<p>Money and control. Let me tell you why.</p>
<p>Multiple German politicans have been caught in "mask deals". <br>
https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/wdr/corona-masken-gewinn-101.html<br>
<a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr-wdr/klage-provisionen-corona-101.html">https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr-wdr/klage-provisionen-corona-101.html</a><br>
Both sources are in German since I am talking about German politicans here.</p>
<p>I reckon this is only the tip of the iceberg. We only know about the ones that were caught.</p>
<p>Do you really think someone would make a profit off mask mandates but not off tests or a vaccine mandate?</p>
<p>Even if this was not the case governments have already spent money to order vaccines from producers. They do have an incentive to use them otherwise the blatant waste of taxpayer money might cast a shadow on their image.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now let's talk about control.</p>
<p>Most media in Germany cover the pandemic from a certain point of view. Not all of them but most. Isn't it interesting how the media can be used to influence the people in a specific way.</p>
<p>To shape someones view in a certain way is everything a politican can dream of.</p>
<p>If you control the way the people think you have total control. No need to force someone to do sth if they do it because they want to.</p>
<p>To give an example how this can be used:</p>
<p>Climate change is a very popular topic in Germany. It has been used to implement a new CO2 tax at the beginning of 2021.<br>
If people think of climate change as the biggest problem they are way more likely to pay more taxes to stop it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; What agenda do they have?</p>
<p>If you had the power to run your country the way you want to wouldn't you use it?</p>
<p>Maybe you wouldn't deceive people to act in a way you want them to but I guarantee you not everybody has a moral compass that points towards north.</p>
