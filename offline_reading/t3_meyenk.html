    <strong>The Absurdity of the Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>My employer has surprised me by not requiring the vaccine. What amazes me is the fact that so many people have volunteered to take it despite people who have recieved it before them saying how much it fucks you up. Everyone in my workplace walks around talking about how sick they felt, the hot flashes, the aches and pains, puking their brains out, etc. So what do they do!? They take the damn shot. It's the most asinine thing I've ever heard</p>
<p>They also managed to get my brother to be one of the first in line for the shot. Normally he doesn't buy into this kind of hype and has been critical of our overreaction to the virus since day one. But he was convinced he'd be doing it for the better of society since he is a first responder</p>
<p>Another thing is that everyone talks about how everything should be "free" and provided by the guv'ment. But look at the atrocity that is the vaccine rollout. Inefficiency, waste, and excess spending are hallmarks of any government authority. Do you really want this level of inadaquecy controlling every aspect of your daily life?</p></p>

<p>He survived 15 months of being exposed to the pathogen and now thinks that his immune system doesn't work. I'm sorry to hear that a family member made this decision.</p>

        <p>I’m 100% sure I had covid after my roommate got back from China last year. I had all the covid symptoms and even “long covid” because it took forever for the cough to go away. Have been totally fine for a year.</p>
<p>I’ve been working and traveling all over the country for the last year. I don’t wear masks unless I’m somewhere that requires it. I’m immune because I already had the damn shit, and if I get it again I don’t care because it’s just an annoying cold/flu for a healthy 32-year-old. I’ll take a week off and call it a day.</p>

        <p>Yes, I'm quite surprised as well</p>
<p>I tried explaining this logic to my father who got his first jab on Friday. He said since he has comorbidities he's safer getting the vaccine. So basically he's guaranteeing that he gets sick from the vaccine rather than having a very low chance of getting the actual virus. And he hasn't contracted it in the first year and a half since the "outbreak" happened</p>

        <p>I went to a bar in my liberal town the other night, was talking to strangers, and people were praising the vaccine. Some didn’t even know that it has immediate side effects for many!! I keep saying that my child’s teachers couldn’t even do a phone parent-teacher conference because they were so sick from the FIRST vaccine shot. They called in sick the day after being vaccinated.</p>

        <p>My employer isn't mandating it either, but every week they announce a new special privilege the vaccinated get. I about lost it when one privilege is the ability to travel out of state without quarantine. Since when does my job dictate what I get to do on my time off? I'm not in the gd military ffs. I don't even work for the state or the government. The state doesn't even have a travel ban anymore. Insanity.</p>
