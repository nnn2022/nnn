    <strong>Dutch Students share their worries about the future. Depressing as heck.</strong>
    <p><p>So in <a href="https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/studenten-over-hun-zorgen-en-toekomst-alles-wordt-kapot-gemaakt~b611b774/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">this article</a> from a decent middle ground-ish newspaper in The Netherlands, students share their fears and concerns for their future.  My country very strongly blames young people and students for the second wave we're in right now. These stories by students are simply depressing. Things cant go on like this. </p>
<p>I'm not gonna translate the whole thing word for word-accurate but grab some main things. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Rough translation:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Rijk (21) Says:  </p>
<p>Young people need to make themselves heard, not just whining and complaining. Take action. What makes it extra hard for us is that they make it seem like we're not being responsible, but that's not all of us. My social life is minimal. I live alone and study online. Teachers try, but you cant make online class interesting. I want to discuss the material and talk on after class. I think I'm missing out on knowledge.  If feels like things are on standby. I'm lucky that i'm still studying. I couldnt imagine Having to find  a job right now. Economic consequences will be great and I'm worried about that. As an Arts student i was already worried about that, but now its worse. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Rivka (17) says: </p>
<p>I dream about failing my studies. I was looking forward to studying. I'm worried that when if finish my internship i wont be capable enough because it is all so limited. </p>
<p>Marya  (20) says: </p>
<p>I was trying to find my own place to live and was looking for a job at restaurants. All that ended. I have no social contacts, no income, studying is hard. It requires a lot of discipline to study online. I do not have that discipline. I feel like I'm learning a lot less. I have no idea whether i will learn enough to be able to practically work in my field. My adult life is delayed. This is a very stressful period for me. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Amine (26) says:</p>
<p>Everything i put every last minute of free time into for years is gone. I ran an events company next to my studies and invested all my time and resources in it. My company almost doesnt exist anymore. I have so many questions: how long will this take? Will i be able to keep studying? Do i just keep hoping things will work out somehow?  I have a lot of fear and stress. It shows itself in eating and sleeping badly. I am irritated where before i was always joking. It is very depressing that I was working so hard on my future and now it no longer exists. I hardly go outside. I want to stay in bed all day. It's ridiculous that they point to young people to place blame. You cant generalize like that. it only polarizes us. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lena (23) says: </p>
<p>I am good at minimizing things, other people always have it worse than I do, and that way i stay positive. But I'm struggling because i go outside so little. I live on my own and couldnt visit my parents because they are vulnerable. I have only one our of physical school a week. In the short term I'm not very worried. I took some time during lockdown to find out information and sing up for extra classes that i otherwise would never have done. But if this continues i could have problems. I need to do a report for my minor, and that is very hard in corona-times. So i went to protest at the Museumplein last month, to show that i want changes. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Levi (20) says:</p>
<p>I'm on the board of my student union. That should bring people together. I'm 20, this should be the best year of my study, but it isn't. I get that it cant be helped. But it's a shame. I don't meet new people, especially now that everything closes at 10pm. I was thinking about getting on a dating app, but I'd rather meet someone irl.  Studying is harder too. Normally I would ask questions after class, but that is harder. Concentrating is harder too. Even though I'm a positive person. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sara (21) says:</p>
<p>I was supposed to be studying abroad. Going to the UK to meet new people in a new place. It almost feels like i'm just biding my time. If all goes well i'll get my Bachelors this year. I was planning to begin a Masters after this. But now i might take a gap year. I notice I'm rethinking a lot of my choices. Although i'm not sure if I'll be able to travel during a gap year.  How, when Where? no one can tell me. Socially I'm doing alright. I live with my boyfriend and some housemates. But I see very little of my friends. A huge contrast to before when i often went for drinks.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sohpie (19) says:</p>
<p>i used to go clubbing every week. I try to stay positive, this is a hard time for everyone. But I'm worried about how long this is gonna take. I'm doing an internship at a hotel and have seen the consequences. i hope to find a job in the tourist industry. When I started studying i thought there would always be work in tourism, but now i worry about getting a job. Next year i finish studying, i hope things will be better then, but who knows. It doesnt help that i cant even go partying anymore. I find it very weird that people blame us young people for the crisis. We cannot go out and many people like me adhere to that. I wonder if clubs and bars will survive the crisis. Will we be able to go out after corona? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sjoerd (21) says: </p>
<p>You cant put all the blame on us. I was able to do fun things the last two years of my study. I pity the firstyears. They say your study time is the best of your life. That's different now, it's not nice at all. I lost my job in the service industry. I feel like it is taboo for students to complain or show resistance now. We are told to stop whining so much. As though we are less important. Yes we played a part in the spread. But you cant just blame us.</p></p>

        <p>it’s sad for sure, but i’m not surprised. i know 2 people in this age range that have already killed themselves over this BS. these dictators have taken away everything we had to live for without any set date for when it’ll end. </p>
<p>i wonder how anyone is still happy during these times. i was happy and expecting to do plenty with my future before this lockdown, but now my day-to-day moods only consist of anger, sadness and disappointment.</p>

        <p>Tell them to go into law... Court rooms and politics is where we will win back our future!</p>
<p>The great reset and depopulation agenda is being taking very seriously by the group who is orchestrating the whole thing... It's time people started pushing back as seriously as the eugenics planning global depopulation.</p>
<p>Europe is back in lockdown mode within a few weeks, the propaganda networks have been reporting " record cases " across Europe.</p>
<p>They won't give you your freedom back, you'll have to take it back from them...</p>

        <p>The court room is completely rigged by the same people pushing this global reset agenda, there is nothing to be won there.</p>
