    <strong>So what the fuck does the "vaccine" actually do exactly? Cause so far I'm pretty fucking unimpressed.</strong>
    <p><p>You can still get Covid. You can still spread Covid. You can still die WITH Covid. On top of that you're putting yourself at risk not only with the short term adverse effects (sorry, ANXIETY ATTACKS) but with unknown long term effects too. You are literally taking a gamble with your life for a cold virus with a 99.9% survival rate.</p>
<p>All so you could, what, feel smug and superior towards the unvaxxed? So you could go on holiday to some country that will no doubt go into lockdown because of their authoritarian government using the excuse of a few fucking cases to tighten their iron grip on a subservient populace scared of their own fucking shadows, forcing you to scurry your lard ass back to the airport before you're left stranded there and isolated in a fucking hotel room for three months?</p>
<p>It's fucking cowardice and a lack of critical thinking that's left you feeling like absolute shit, pissing in the wind with your fucking "I'm vaccinated!" sticker taped proudly to your fucking balls. Don't blame us, cause we tried to fucking warn you over and over and fucking over again and all we got in return was a giant middle finger and death threats. Do yourself a favour: wake up and smell the burning toast, because it means you're having a fucking stroke and you need to get yourself to a hospital ASAP.</p>
<p>What a fucking joke.</p></p>

        <p>Not too long ago I had a doomer screeching at me over on /r/uk because I said I wasn't going to take the holy vax. </p>
<p>Fast forward a couple of days later and the obesity problem comes up, with the government discussing various taxes on junk food. I put my two cents in (i.e. people need to take responsibility for their own health, eat less and exercise).</p>
<p>The same user from before starts chastising me about how hard it is for them to lose weight, how obesity is a disease, how it's everyone else's fault that they're the size of a bus.</p>
<p>So essentially I'm expected to pay through the nose when I occasionally want chocolate or something because this pre-diabetic lard arse can't control himself. On top of that, I'm a bad person if I don't let them inject me with untested sludge, because this monstrous, corpulent piece of shit can barely steal himself away from eating long enough to walk to the fridge and is therefore vulnerable to kung flu.</p>
<p>I'm done trying to reason with them. They can shove their jabs up their flabby arses. Who knows, maybe it <em>is</em> all a conspiracy to reduce the population. If so, at least I won't have to put up with their stupidity. Remember that these morons can vote. Depopulation is looking better by the day!</p>

        <p>You need to stop thinking about it as protection from a cold virus with a 99.9% survival rate.  Do you really think global governments, the government/media complex, and big pharma reaaaalllyyyy care about your health?  Do you think that you surviving Covid19 is really their underlying motivation?</p>

        <p>It's all in plain sight because they have to leave admission to truth; they're never hiding it they are convincing you to choose not to see it. That difference zone is called propaganda. You're never off limits from rectifying contradiction; you're made to CHOOSE TO FEEL STUPID for doing so. Most people have no self-esteem. It's an easy win.</p>
<p>People that do not understand that this is how they/the elite fucking skirt karma, are the first to line the fuck up and insists conspiracy isn't real because money etc. You literally cannot have a larger group of morons to farm into infinity for what little wealth leverage they may possess.</p>

        <p>I'm a biologist and I'm as angry about this as you are. But the vaccines are still very effective at preventing severe cases in people who are actually at risk for it. </p>
<p>Part of the strength of NNN is that we don't deal in absolutes. We can appreciate the nuance of things. So while you CAN do all the things in your first sentence, what matters is the probability of all of them!</p>

        <p>I agree, over 70 and I’d consider it… for almost anyone else it’s a total waste of time and likely to cause unnecessary evolutionary pressures leading to something like Mareks Disease</p>
<p>Given how hard it’s being pushed, to all ages, regardless of whether or not you’ve had a previous infection and now have natural immunity, makes me think some sort of agenda is in play</p>

        <p>I thought this too, but I just read some mainstream article saying that they are finding that the vaccines are not as effective for the frail elderly and immunocompromised (which would be who would need the most protection). So now I'm not sure if it's even worthwhile for the vulnerable to get them.</p>

        <p>I think that assessment is complicated by the fact that we had likely already reached herd immunity by the time the vaccines were available, so the case can be made that while you may be rolling the dice with covid, you are rolling a die with far fewer faces (if you take my meaning) by going out of your way to inject yourself with a product known to have severe adverse reactions</p>

        <p>Exactly! There are even risk calculators that can estimate your chances of hospitalization and dying based on your sex, age, pre existing conditions. I recommend everyone try it. Based on my findings, my risk is so low that it is completely unnecessary for me to get the vaccine. But someone over the age of 65 who’s obese and maybe has a couple of other health problems, yeah I can see it being beneficial for them.</p>

        <p>&rt;So far I'm pretty unimpressed.  </p>
<p>This is really a very professional way to put it when your employer mandates the vaccine.  If they can't see that they got the ol' bait and switch on the vaccine, then they're beyond hope.  </p>
<p>Pfizer's gone from a claimed 95% efficacy rate (high enough to get you back to normal life they said), to a revised 86% efficacy rate (almost assuredly lower tho) with renewed masks and lockdowns for everyone including vaxxed.  And now they're trying to get everyone to think the booster shots are the answer?</p>

        <p>It's actually higher than that and jumped a lot over the last month because of the increased spread. I agree to an extent in the UK, I think it's gonna burn itself out of people to infect. But the bulk of that coverage is through vaccination, not natural exposure. It's why the least vaccinated states in the US are getting the most cases now</p>

        <p>That's such dog shit and you know it. It's clearly being/been spread by people who are exposed to the symptomatic. 90% exposure means 90% meaningfully exposed. Of those I'd suspect 75% actually got it, and of that .03% died.</p>

        <p>Where did you magic the 0.03% from? 1.77 in US and 2.2 in UK. Even if the deaths are a 10th of what's said its nowhere near.</p>
<p>How do you explain the increased spread in unvaxxed states versus vaxxed states then? Hospitals filling up in all the southern states. Bought and paid for hospital staff lying I guess.</p>

        <p>Right...</p>
<p>On worldometer. There have been 4,229,654 deaths, and 198,295,012 cases globally. (4,229,654 / 19,8295,012) * 100 means the average death per case is 2.13%. This is probably inaccurate due to the third world unreporting deaths, and if you want to argue overeporting on PCR tests (false positives would make covid MORE deadly but nevermind), fine. But this is the approximate we have.</p>
<p>The 99.97% number has been around for ages, and if you're arguing that that against the entire world's population, then you're saying Covid has infected every single person on earth. How is that remotely possible or provable? And this number has floated about for ages.</p>
<p>4,229,654 (Deaths) / 7,800,000,000 (world population) *100 = 0.054%. already higher than the 0.03% deaths you just said, probably because someone magicked that number when deaths were around 2,340,000.</p>
<p>So covid has infected everyone on earth at that time last year, and everyone's still getting reinfected. Is that what you're saying? 2,340,000 global deaths occurred at start of this year, so you're saying Rona spread from Wuhan, China to every single person in the world in that year, and vaccines or natural immunity do nothing as people keep getting reinfected?</p>

        <p>Tripling the cases would be 600 million, still nowhere close to 7.8 billion to make the 0.03% arguement work. Also if cases aren't being counted (which I agree with), what makes you think the deaths are being counted accurately either? In some remote village or town, without a clinic, let alone a hospital with covid treatment and testing facilities.</p>

        <p>It reduces your chances of getting COVID to around 5% of what it was before, but if you still hit that 1 in 20 chance it also reduces your chances of dying from it, and more importantly it reduces your chances to give it to others, thus making more lockdowns unneccesary.</p>

        <p>RRR and ARR are complementary, not contradictory. Risk reduction is used to guide decision-making in RCTs, in addition to weighing clinical significance vs statistical significance. 
It’s also important to consider NNT and CI while considering the precision of effects.</p>

<p>I agree with that. I'm just pointing out that most people see "95% effective" and don't understand what that really means.</p>
<p>A study might show 95% efficacy for a treatment, but if the risk to the control group is already less than 1% then it's really statistical noise at that point and you're just cherry picking which study gives the most favorable result.</p>

        <p>ARR is specific to RCT. It doesn’t have real world meaning. For instance, RRR tells you how effective the vaccine, regardless of the number of cases. ARR tells you the difference of risk for someone in the control group vs the treatment group. It’s more useful for, let’s say, studying the benefit of a cardiac medication, cause you aren’t going to catch a cardiac disease by going outside. With a virus, your chance of contracting the virus isn’t going to be same as those in the study. There are varying risks across populations, geography, comorbidities and variants.</p>

        <p>A month ago I heard people saying with the vaccine you cannot get covid. The latest mainstream articles now are saying things like "3/4 of these people who got infected with covid at zyz festival had been vaccinated." This happened in the us were the vaccinated to non vaccinated is still 60/40. Also Iceland is 90 percent vaccinated but most of the hospilizations of covid were the vaccinated. And also this new mainstream article directly contradicts your point of reducing your chances of giving it to others https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/cdc-team-war-has-changed-as-delta-variant-dangers-emerge/2021/07/30/545b1634-f145-11eb-81b2-9b7061a582d8_story.html</p>

        <p>Look, I'm not going to change your mind but just understand this: if a vaccine that is given to 100 million people has a effectiveness of 90% that means 10 million of those people won't develop antibodies and therefore will be just as vulnerable to get COVID-19 than before</p>
<p>Vaccines that had been available for decades like polio are less effective than that. But they work on a large scale, they stop massive transmission but individuals only get improve chances.</p>
