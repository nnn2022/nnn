    <strong>Authoritarians had happily seized an entire year of our freedoms, on top of destroying the general mental health of a functioning society</strong>
    <p><p>After reading this article, I’m even more aware of the horrible effects on a society’s mental health such as depression and paranoia over the 
COVID shutdown and mandatory masking. </p>
<p>I fear the long term ramifications on a society that accepts this to be the “new normal”, just because we’re supposed to accept order authoritative orders from the elites who “know best”</p>
<p>Worst still, is how it’ll affect the normal development of children’s psychology, even when the facts and science shows that children are not a vector of infection. </p>
<p>As the article said, authoritarian people do no seek truth, they seek authority. </p>

        <p>Makes me think it was intentional at this point. They were losing their ability to disrupt the economy when they felt convenient due to the proliferation of new forms of currency. This was their last hoorah to ensure they maintain power over the world's economy through planned implosions.</p>
<p>I mean just look at the pattern of countries that abolished their federal reserve bank, and what happened to them, is that us all right now?</p>

        <p>I don't see the late night shows as spearheading it so much as simply carrying the narrative and helping to impress on the masses that questioning vaccinations is the act of whacko conspiracy theorists.  Of course that helps with instances like Connecticut, whose legislature is pushing through a measure to eliminate the religious exemption for vaccinating children.  All is part of a far bigger picture where individuals are expected to cede more and more personal decision making to centralized authority "for their own good".</p>

<p>We are really fucked if we allow them to inject us or our kids when we don't believe in it. You are sort of permanently weakened at that point, after giving up that sovereignty. I already feel weaker for wearing the fucking mask but at least that's not inside my body</p>

        <p>Solid thought... Christianity seems to be more in the political crosshairs than Judaism though.  The selectivity exposed by the deafening silence concerning hardline Islamic sexism and homophobia is more consistent with this being a war on the culture and community stabilizing influences that minimize the need for central government intervention than it is with concern for the plight of groups designated for special protections and for which the "hate crime" upgrade supposedly benefits.</p>
<p>Christianity is more mainstream than Judaism... Christianity is also seen as more of a blue collar spiritual path helping to govern the behavior and morals of a larger population.  Pushing themes equating its teachings/interpretations with intolerance and non-inclusiveness together with sowing resentment of the church's tax exempt status will erode its influence over time.</p>
<p>Also- there's seemingly less concern about painting Christianity with a broad brush regarding the conduct of some who profess it- like the Klan- but don't dare associate the throwing of gays from rooftops by radical Muslims... just an example.</p>
<p>What Jews believe is not currently of too much concern- at least not now.  Marginalizing and silencing Christianity seems a priority currently- perhaps once that community has been intimidated into slinking into the shadows, attention will be turned to Judaism.</p>

<p>Whenever you see a unified global response to something (and any state that doesn't play along being demonised) then you can be quite confident that the aim is always more power, more control, more authority, more centralisation of decision-making, and more domination of resources for the elite.</p>

        <p>I am a progressive, I feel weird even being on this board but I don't trust or accept what is going on anymore. I even in one group said totalitarianism is getting worse. Yeah via Covid it definitely is. We were all played for fools, from both sides, as they are now busy tightening down the screws. None of us choose for this to happen, they let this shit spread willfully, whatever real virus there is, I think something is happening, but they are cooking numbers too and manipulating the hell out of people with 'fear', variants" and "asymptomatics" and now experimental vaccines being shoved down everyone's throats. </p>
<p>They don't give an F if we even have health care and many Americans don't but we are supposed to sign up. Whose going to pay the medical bills if this stuff goes wrong? Even with Medicare you have to pay 20 percent of the bills. What about uninsured people? They have used fear and lies to screw us all over.  None of us chose this. The economy is beyond repair. The work my husband lost won't come back, and when unemployment ends, what will happen then. He has some work from one company [gig] but if that goes there's not going to be anything left. This is entire society is based on lies. Both sides suck, good cop, bad cop.</p>

        <p>think of it more as what "tools" people have - and what sort of "frames" they are using to look at the world, i typically view ideologies as different sorts of colored glasses which color reality to a specific way.</p>
<p>half the population is higher on the F-scale - being libertarian (not necessarily politically libertarian, just as far as actual negative freedoms / choices) has been the exception, and actually respecting other people's rights has never been the norm nor respected by the majority.</p>
<p>and to add a little postmodernist thinking here - biases / bigotries don't disappear, they change into new forms to reinforce new or existing power structures. </p>
<p>look - throughout history the hierarchy has despised the mob for various reasons - some valid, some not, depending on your political persuasion.  however, what aristotle as well as stalin had in common was a despising of the common person, or what a described as living hand to mouth - i don't think this can be solved in any way, unfortunately.</p>
<p>so the next best bet - a war of narratives which eventually decide shit.</p>

        <p>I would venture to guess, and this is only a guess mind you, that once this covid thing has passed, the mortality rate among seniors will plummet for the next 3 years. This will tell us one thing. That a virus turned pandemic by the governments and media merely advanced the death of the elderly by 2 years on the outside. People well over the average age of death. And that is why we destroyed the lives and livelihoods of millions. Shameful.</p>

<p>I call BS.</p>
<p>Because how many times did we hear this story from <em>all around the world</em>?  Dozens and dozens of times over the past year.</p>
<p>And how many times did it actually happen?  How many times were people dying because the hospitals were flooded with covid patients?</p>
<p>How many times did news report on something that "had happened" instead of something that "was about to happen"?</p>
<p>Apparently <em>every country in the world</em> regardless of prosperity, economic system, government, or "caring people" managed to avoid having their hospitals flooded.</p>
<p>Even the poorest countries with huge slum areas where you <em>think</em> the virus would do some real damage avoided those nightmare scenarios.</p>
<p>Everywhere, apparently, just "lucked out".</p>
