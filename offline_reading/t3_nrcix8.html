        <p>Again, the real purpose of mandated masking is forcing people to participate in political theater.  The masks are little more than crisis costumes and irritants with minimal effectiveness to limit virus spread.</p>

        <p>The tweet author picked a great spot to crop his screenshot. The full "bottom line" is</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Bottom line:</strong> generally there were not differences in Ill/URI/or flu rates when masks were used, although when early use and compliance was taken into account, a few times a difference was seen. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
In addition: <br>
This case control study noted that, among SARS patients in Hong Kong without a known source of infection, cases {27.9%) were less likely than uninfected controls {58.7%) to report wearing a mask frequently in public , for what that's worth. </p>
<p>My interpretation is: Masks might not have a big impact on transmission, for any effect to be seen people need to wear masks pro-actively and consistently. Additionally, during the SARS outbreak, people who got sick were less likely to have been maskers.</p>
<p>All this seems to support having the public  proactively wear masks to reduce pre-symptomatic spread, and reinforce the idea that masks alone are insufficient so social distancing and limiting gatherings should also be recomended.</p>
