        <p>everyone is feeling this in different ways ironically enough. i say this despite the breadth of opinions on current events. further, having been involved with more than a few different groups since the lockdowns took off, i find that one is better off bolstering themselves in these times, rather than seeking those with which they share an ideology. recognize and have faith that things are changing and that if and when we start to see a significant push for mandatory vaccination, there will be a backlash concurrent to the effort on the part of the govt to force the shit. what is better is trying to find ways to genuinely enjoy the company of those around you that have different, sometimes drastically so, beliefs from your own. that said, if they are advocating mandatory, enforced vaccination, distance yourself as much as possible and donâ€™t engage with them about any of this stuff.</p>
