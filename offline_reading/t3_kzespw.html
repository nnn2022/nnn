        <p>No. If the vaccine works on YOU then YOU will not be able to spread it to OTHERS anymore. Therefore, there should be no reason for you to continue social distancing or wearing a mask.</p>
<p>You can only spread covid if you have covid. The vaccine is supposed to stop you from getting covid. Unless you’re saying it doesn’t actually do that... is that what you’re saying?</p>

        <p>The covid “vaccine” isn’t really a vaccine. It’s an MRNA treatment (the first of its kind) designed to lessen symptoms and make it easier to get over covid quicker. It doesn’t provide herd immunity or prevent recipients from being disease vectors.</p>
<p>Most people have issues with it due to one or more of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s being falsely marketing as a vaccine.</li>
<li>The injection has had less research than most traditional vaccines, even though the technology is completely experimental.</li>
<li>We have no idea what the long term side effects of MRNA could possibly be.</li>
<li>Many who’ve tried to raise awareness of negative reactions that have already happened have been silenced or told that severe side effects are rare by the manufacturers, their scientists, and injection proponents. There haven’t been studies done on what might be actually causing those reactions or making them more likely.</li>
<li>Governments, businesses, and schools are already planning on making this experimental injection with unknown side-effects required and many (mainly tech industry) billionaires are advocating for mandatory injections and planning to create tracking systems for it. </li>
</ol>
<p>Injection mandate advocates argue that this is the same as making certain vaccines mandatory in schools. It’s not. The whole reason why traditional vaccines are mandatory is because some students may have conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated and if most other students are vaccinated, they can’t be disease vectors for the students who can’t get the vaccine (also called herd immunity). Some people take issue with that but it’s not really relevant to covid because this argument doesn’t hold up for the covid MRNA treatments. The covid injections don’t prevent recipients from being disease vectors, meaning they cannot provide herd immunity. </p>
<p>Why are powerful people trying to mandate an experimental treatment with unknown long-term effects that has caused severe side effects in some recipients for unknown reasons that are not being studied, and acting like it’s the same as vaccine mandates, when mandating it won’t even achieve herd immunity (the stated purpose of traditional vaccine mandates)?</p>

        <p>A traditional vaccine injects you with antigens to train your body to make its own antibodies. With mRNA, your body makes the antigens as well. It’s not a vaccine as much as it is a mechanism that trains your body into becoming its own vaccine.</p>

        <p>Some can take it like that but as someone who isn't anti-vax I don't see it that way. When you're vaccinated there's no undoing it, what is done to your body is done. Someone else being vaccinated doesn't magically change what your vaccine does for you. It's ridiculous when vaccinated people get scared of others who aren't, because that means they don't believe it works (at least well enough to be worth crap like being the least bit exposed to the disease they are vaccinated for) yet still choose to get it and push others to get it.</p>

<p>So I get vaccinated but i'm just as vunerable as if I never got vaccinated, then suddenly it starts working and doing it's thing on my body once everyone vaccinated? You're saying there is no point in getting vaccinated unless the whole population has?</p>

        <p>I'lll give you the BOTD and assume you actually don't have any idea how vaccines work. </p>
<p>So, you build up an immunity when you're vaccinated but that doesn't make you absolutely invulnerable. Just like you can still get the flu, anthrax, yellow fever, chicken pox, or any other disease that you can be vaccinated against, you can also still get COVID after being vaccinated. However, that isn't as big an issue when the vast majority of people are vaccinated against a disease. When everyone has a much higher resistance to catching an infection, it naturally cuts down on how many people have and are transmitting that infection.. which cuts down on the risk of catching it even further... That's how we've nearly erradicated diseases through vaccination. Not because we literally <em>couldn't</em> get them, but because we built up a large enough population with a high enough resistance that there simply wasn't anyone to spread it. If one person gets vaccinated, making them let's say 80% immune, but they're constantly coming into contact with people who are spreading the disease, they'll still eventually contract it. There's still that 20% chance every time they meet someone that they'll catch the disease (these are just arbitrary percentages to help prove a point). If everybody is 80% immune, except for those who cannot get vaccines because of allergies, then you're coming into contact with far fewer people who would have the disease, and that 80% immunity is going to be pretty effective against the few people you do come into contact with who have that specific disease. You still have a 20% chance of catching it everytime you run into someone with it, but now instead of 600 people exposing it to you, let's say you only have 10 people that are... So you're much less likely to have the unfortunate outcome of contracting the disease. This isn't just for COVID... This is literally any and every vaccine out there. </p>
<p>But either this subreddit is legitimately filled with absolute morons, or the word COVID just makes people shut off their brains and they think that somehow it's supposed to be different. </p>
<p>What I don't understand is how there are grown ass adults that can't figure something out about vaccines that most of us learned when we were like 5.</p>

        <p>The measles vaccine is 97% effective after the second dose. If you take the measles vaccine, it doesn't matter if no one around you takes it. You are still 97% protected from contracting measles.</p>
<p>Herd immunity works a bit differently. When a high percentage of a population is vaccinated against measles, outbreaks don't happen. It doesn't make the herd immune to the disease; it makes the herd less susceptible to waves of the disease.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this particular type of vaccine does not bring sterilizing immunity. It only protects the recipient from severe disease symptoms. The more people who get it, the more asymptomatic infections will occur.</p>

<p>The only difference is that you made the distinction between sterilizing and effective immunity. However, effective immunity still prevents the contraction of disease in most cases too.</p>

        <p>Let's go slowly, in deference to you:</p>
<p>The OP posted a meme with the tagline: My vaccine <strong>won't work</strong> unless everybody else gets vaccinated.</p>
<p>You show up and demean the room by name-calling and spouting the lie that "That's how vaccines work." Then you respond to a perfectly civil question with more insults and a needlessly long condescending answer, which still attempts to bolster the false concept of "my vaccine <strong>won't work</strong>."</p>
<p>My answer boiled the truth to the essence: Your vaccine works, no matter who else takes it. </p>
<p>Stressing out about others' vaccination status (as the title meme shows) is a useless activity. How do authoritarians live happy lives when they can't control everyone's lives?</p>

        <p>No, OP called those who get vaccines COVID - idiots because people who are vaccinated are pointing out that vaccines are only <em>so effective</em> unless we all get vaccinated. </p>
<p>I made the correct assumption that the person did not understand the concept of vaccines and then explained the situation as simply and thoroughly as I could. I was not being condescending with that explanation, but if you took it that way maybe it's because I pointed out some <em>very obvious facts</em> about vaccines that you and this subreddit seem to miss, and you felt threatened by that.</p>
<p>Again, I will state, if something is 97% effective against a disease, your chances of contracting a disease <em>are still higher</em> unless <em>everyone</em> has that 97% effective immunity. This is really, <em>really</em> simple math. </p>
<p>You quite literally said "actually that's not how these things work" and then said <em>exactly</em> what I said using different words and percentages. </p>
<p>So yes, this subreddit is filled with dillusional morons. I'm not being condescending; I'm not being childish; I'm stating a fact. You're literally explaining to yourself how vaccines work and <em>why it's important for large populations to get vaccinated against diseases</em> and yet you and this entire subreddit still don't seem to understand that's <em>why</em> people are saying to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>This whole subreddit is about "No New Normal" after COVID; however, at every single step of the way towards fighting and preventing the spread of this disease so that we can move on with our lives and get past it, people like <em>you</em> and people inhabiting this subreddit are quite literally doing everything in their power to stop us from moving past this thing. I've never seen so many people so <em>willfully ignore</em> all scientific fact and reasoning, turning on the <em>very people</em> who study this shit for a living. So yes, I'm going to call you idiots. Because you are. </p>
<p>I was not being condescending when I responded to the <em>very</em> stupid assumption that "oh, well I get vaccinated but it's not effective so why get vaccinated but it magically works when everyone's vaccinated" by explaining how resistances and herd immunity works.</p>

        <p>&rt; No, OP called those who get vaccines COVID - idiots because people who are vaccinated are pointing out that vaccines are only so effective unless we all get vaccinated. </p>
<p>No, that's a lie. "Covid-idiot !!!" was the title to the post, not a reference to people who get vaccines. The wording of the meme is important: "My vaccine <strong>won't work</strong>..." Your explanation of vaccines in a larger society doesn't correspond to the expression of despair from the "Covid-idiot" pictured in the meme.</p>
<p>&rt; You quite literally said "actually that's not how these things work" and then said exactly what I said using different words and percentages. </p>
<p>That's a lie as well. My comment: 
&rt; "The measles vaccine is 97% effective after the second dose. If you take the measles vaccine, it doesn't matter if no one around you takes it. You are still 97% protected from contracting measles.</p>
<p>&rt; Herd immunity works a bit differently. When a high percentage of a population is vaccinated against measles, outbreaks don't happen. It doesn't make the herd immune to the disease; it makes the herd less susceptible to waves of the disease.</p>
<p>&rt; Unfortunately, this particular type of vaccine does not bring sterilizing immunity. It only protects the recipient from severe disease symptoms. The more people who get it, the more asymptomatic infections will occur.</p>
<p>Kindly show me where I <strong>literally</strong> said "actually that's not how these things work." In fact, you claimed that my comment repeated everything in yours. So which is it? </p>
<p>So to simplify this: YOUR VACCINE WORKS IF YOU TAKE IT. EVEN IF YOUR NEIGHBORS DON'T. So don't stress out or panic if you find that others don't behave the way you want them to. Don't attempt to browbeat them into acting in your best interest, or even "the greater good" by insulting them and their life choices. Mind your own business, and stop acting as the town busybody.</p>

        <p>.. expect for you not to be able to post an actual constructive response? Are you using social shaming and insults because that's a tactic that works well at getting you to think something?</p>
<p>Your video consists of two men throwing balls at skittles, calling claims that vaccines don't work "bullshit". That's it. There's no explanation.   It's presumably aimed at children.  In any case it does nothing to prove what you asserted it did. Did you not watch it? Why did you post it?</p>

        <p>Jfc. So believing in science and trusting that the scientists who have racked up 100s of thousands of hours doing <strong><em>actual</em></strong> research for this vaccine know more than the general public is an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect fucking how??

        <p>Hey, buddy. It'll be okay. You'll get to kiss your siblings on the mouth again someday. I know wearing a mask scares you shitless, but listen to the rest of us - you can be brave. It'll be okay. I promise you it will. </p>
<p>And yeah, RuneScape is fun. </p>
<p>You seem to know a lot about gay acts and seem to have a real fixation on them though... Do you have something you wanna explain? If you're gay, it's cool. Nobody is gonna judge you. Have you not been able to kiss your boyfriend lately? Has he not been there to hold you and comfort you at night? Is that why you're so angry and scared and acting like the world is ending? Awww, buddy. I'm sure he misses you too. But I promise you, you'll get to kiss him again one day. Just stay strong for a little while longer, lil fella. I know you can be brave!</p>
