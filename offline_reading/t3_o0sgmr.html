    <strong>Does anyone know anything about businesses requiring vaccines in Tennessee?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m going to Nashville in July and I obviously don’t have my vaccine.  Nor do I plan on getting it.  I know many southern states have already passed bills to keep businesses from requiring vaccines but I’m having some trouble finding information on Tennessee.  Is anyone from Tennessee or Nashville or knows this information?</p></p>

        <p>I live in Nashville.  Most businesses are going on good faith that maskless customers have been vaccinated.  Even thought its not a vaccine and is pure toxic crap. So you shouldn't have problems shopping. Some store are sadly still clinging to the useless mask policy. Now here is where it gets interesting, that is the case for customers, but as I've told people there as an undiscusssed issue. Most businesses are telling their employees mask up or vax up and yes, they wanna see proof. 1930's nazi Germany, " show us your papers." Me and a group called Tennessee stands tried to pass a law that would ban vaccine passports, wich is what a vaccine card is. So they are already here. And another law that would make requiring the vaccines or masks illegal in businesses and to governor and mayors. But they failed or were not even heard. We are still fighting here and will not give up. I never mask, and will never vax. There are many who feel that way. But so far only employees are being forced, customers in most stores can shop maskless and vaxless as they are not asking for proof. But they will never get me to comply. And I have done neither. I can list cities and stores that are actualy following the constitution for you if you want. 
                         Kind regards and fighting every day,
                              San</p>

        <p>That’s great to hear!  Keep fighting the good fight.  I’m doing the same up here in the Midwest.  Thank you for the information, and yeah I’d love to see that list of places still following the constitution.</p>

        <p>I can't speak about Nashville but I have had no problems in kingsport or Johnson city. The places I have been didn't have a mask sign except for a kroger, which wasn't enforced.
No one asked about vaccine status either.</p>
