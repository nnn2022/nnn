        <p>The elite know DAMN well the amount of business they will lose if they fully go through with requiring vaccinations, that's why they are pushing it so fucking hard right now. No way in HELL businesses are going to turn away ~50% of their clientele. They know this, government knows this, it is just a scare tactic to get as many vaccinated as possible to get that $$$$$ before the majority completely check out and wake up.</p>

<p>Yeah, they will. This is a purposeful demolition of the economy, of liberty, and of society. They are all smugly smirking as this happens. Once the economy tanks, they will initiate the next phase wherein you must give up all your property and also get their vaccine/passports. The leaked documents of the Canadian government's "Covid roadmap" states all this.</p>

        <p>I frankly don't give a fuck about Canada. They may as well already be Marxists. I know that this is the intent of some higher ups here in the U.S. government, but what I'm saying is, companies will not put up with it. Massive companies may be in on it, but for the most part I daresay that smaller business will just say fuckit and serve everyone.</p>

        <p>They're doing this all over the world, in basically every country. Canada's roadmap is one of many scripts being used (and the leaked documents state that every country is following this, more or less). </p>
<p>lol, massive companies want this, and are all in. You're blind if you think they actually care about profits now. This is about more than money, it's about changing all of society in such a way that benefits them.</p>

        <p>What do you think their goal is, exactly? </p>
<p>My impression, given how much property blackrock and vanguard have been buying (not ignoring Bill Gate's property holdings either..), is that they want no one to own anything. They want you to rent your home, your car, your services, etc. At the end of the day, the intent of a tyrant is to control you. What greater way to control you than to have only two classes: Those that own, and those the subscribe. Live in the pod, eat the bugs, use the public transport, you'll be happy! Everyone will look the same, think the same, have the same beliefs and culture. </p>
<p>Am I missing something? It's been globohomo since the start, that's their goal.</p>

        <p>Most already are, ESPECIALLY in the Military. I think something like 1/3 of the military in the U.S. outright refused it, who knows how many just haven't gotten it so it may be even higher. Cops for the most part appear to not give a fuck either. We have friends in powerful places, so don't worry about what government goons say. </p>

        <p>Seriously because who the fuck wants to give their medical information just to sit down at a restaurant. This is especially stupid considering when they did the whole sidewalk thing people were bungled up next to each other with no mask. Then they'd get up and put the mask on like COVID somehow knows when they're sitting down to eat.</p>

There were businesses I was going to when indoor dining was banned because they kept their doors opened and ignored the mandates.

        <p>Also obesity.  Just imagine how up in arms these people would be if you were barred from a restaurant if you are BMI was over like, 28.  We'll let you be a bit overweight.  If we want to be hardcore, 25.</p>
<p>Obesity is a bigger killer than covid, so it would be good for your health, like putting your dog on a diet.</p>

        <p>Of all the nonsensical choices, this one confuses me the most.  Nailing your economy to the wall lets you enact all sorts of bullshit they've been trying to push through for years, but just abusing those most loyal to the cause while the red states are staying open and free seems to have no clear advantage.</p>
<p>Take their freedoms, ruin their schooling, oppress them, and they'll like it, sure, but eventually the narrative will fall apart because states that have been open for months (or never closed, bless you Noem!) simply aren't showing negative impacts from the "neanderthal" thinking, and they'll begin to show better school stats, better economies, and obviously more freedom.</p>

        <p>They won’t have a choice.  They will send enforcement officers around to the businesses to make sure they are scanning enough people et cetera.  The enforcement officers will of course have to walk past numerous actual crimes to get to the restaurant but they wont have time to stop them, because they’ll be on a mission of saving the world!</p>
