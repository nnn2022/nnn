    <strong>My teacher's husband died because of covid, and you are here saying nothing happened.</strong>
    <p><p>He was only in his early forties, healthy, and his wife is my english teacher. He wore a mask, but someone else didn't and spread it to him. He was healthy and not too old, but unlucky. now he is dead. And you say nothing is happening? My english teacher is crying over zoom, while you say NOTHING is happening? That it is fake? Go tell it to her face that the risk isn't real</p></p>

        <p>If he was wearing a mask then why would it be somebody else fault?</p>
<p>Should have used an actual respirator instead of a cloth mask, which gives the false impression of safety.</p>

        <p>and why is that? because your selfish ass generation fucked up the economy. Student loans are impossible to pay off, property tax is crazy, and more. Not only that, but you asshats forced african americans too have little money, therefor end up in poor neighborhoods, therefor get bad educations. Ironic that you yourself clearly didn't get a good education since you are on this sub. Or maybe just your sense of wanted others like you, and to feel different since all you are is another boomer that annoys the shit out of everyone and wants to be accepted anywhere, so they start to deny science.</p>

        <p>The fact you think "COVID would have died" lets everyone know that you are an absolute idiot who wouldn't recognize a science if it fell on your head. <br>
Still no proof that your story is true, huh? It sounds 100% made up to me but if you happen to find any proof feel free to share it. <br>
Nice link there, did you find it in the op-ed section? Let me up you some actual scientific studies. Since you are such a strong advocate for "listening", I'm sure you will take the time to read through some actual science: </p>
<p>· <strong>February 2021</strong>, the academic journal <em>Aerosol and Air Quality Research</em> published <em>Effect of Wearing Face Masks on the Carbon Dioxide Concentration in the Breathing Zone</em>, <a href="https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-20-07-covid-0403">(Geiss, 2021)</a>. The empirical study's abstract:</p>
<p>the carbon dioxide concentration in the breathing zone was measured while wearing a surgical mask, a KN95 and a cloth mask. For the surgical mask, the concentration was determined under different conditions (office work, slow walking, and fast walking)...Detected carbon dioxide concentrations ranged from <strong>2150</strong> ± 192 to <strong>2875</strong> ± 323 ppm. <strong>The concentrations of carbon dioxide while not wearing a face mask varied from 500–900 ppm</strong>...Walking at a speed of 5 km h–1...resulted in an average carbon dioxide concentration of <strong>2875</strong> ppm. No differences were observed among the three types of face masks tested. According to the literature, these concentrations have no toxicological effect. However, <strong>concentrations in the detected range can cause undesirable symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, and loss of concentration</strong>.</p>
<p>· <strong>February 2021</strong>, <em>The Lancet</em> published <em>Transmission of COVID-19 in 282 clusters in Catalonia, Spain: a cohort study</em>, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099%2820%2930985-3">(Marks et al., 2021)</a>. The authors noted in the Discussion section (page 7):</p>
<p>We did not find <strong>any</strong> evidence of decreased risk of transmission in individuals who reported mask use.</p>
<p>· <strong>January 2021</strong>, <em>The Journal of Hazardous Materials</em> published <em>COVID-19: Performance study of microplastic inhalation risk posed by wearing masks</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389420329460">(Li et al., 2021)</a>. The main empirical result was:</p>
<p>Wearing masks poses microplastic inhalation risk, reusing masks increases the risk.</p>
<p>· <strong>January 2021</strong>, <em>PLOS One</em> published, <em>Comparing the fit of N95, KN95, surgical, and cloth face masks and assessing the accuracy of fit checking</em>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245688">(O'Kelly et al., 2021)</a>. The authors noted:</p>
<p>This study confirms that NIOSH certification that a mask can perform at N95 levels alone is insufficient if the mask is poor fitting. <strong>Proper fit is absolutely necessary if the mask is to offer the wearer protection</strong>. Furthermore, our results indicate it is not enough to assume that any N95 respirator will be likely to fit the majority of a population. The most widely fitting mask, the 8511 N95, fit only three out of the seven participants. Other masks, such as the Aero Pro and Xiantao Zong, did not fit any of the participants adequately.</p>
<p>· <strong>18 December</strong> 2020, in <em>Face masks for preventing respiratory infections in the community: A systematic review</em>, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.16.20248316v1">(Saijonkari et al., 2020)</a> concluded:</p>
<p>The reported effect of masks used outside the home on transmission of droplet-mediated respiratory infections in the population is minimal or non-existent.</p>
<p>· On <strong>20 November</strong> 2020, <em>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</em> published <em>Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses</em>, <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5/epdf/abstract">(Jefferson et al., 2020)</a>. The review noted:</p>
<p>Medical or surgical masks: Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes <strong>no difference</strong> in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort. N95/P2 respirators: Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well reported; discomfort was mentioned.</p>
<p>· On <strong>18 November</strong> 2020, <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> published <em>Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers. A Randomized Controlled Trial</em>, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">(Bundgaard et al., 2020)</a>. This is the first and only RCT we have on mask effectiveness against COVID-19 in community settings, but its findings of ineffectiveness are fully expected in light of all the other RCTs we have on other respiratory viruses. The results of the study:</p>
<p>A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. <strong>Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection</strong>.</p>
<p>· On <strong>17 November</strong> 2020, <em>International Journal of Infectious Diseases</em> published <em>Meta-analysis on facemask use in community settings to prevent respiratory infection transmission shows no effect</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220324504">(Gómez-Ochoa &amp; Muka, 2020)</a>. The authors noted:</p>
<p>there were no significant differences between medical facemasks use only and controls in the odds of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness. Similarly, no differences in laboratory-confirmed influenza risk were observed when comparing mask use solely versus combined intervention of face mask and handwashing, indicating that facemask as solely intervention in community is not associated with reducing respiratory infection. Given the studies used medical masks, cloth masks' efficacy is expected to be even lower; a randomized cluster trial showed that respiratory infection is higher among health care personnel using cloth masks than using medical masks (MacIntyre et al., 2015)...Due to these divergent results and the lack of high-quality research in this area, strong recommendations for facemask use in the community context should be issued with caution until new evidence is available to show their effectiveness. This is even more important, considering that several studies showed that mask use is associated with headache incidence and worsening of pre-existing headache (Lim et al., 2006, Rebmann et al., 2013, Szeinuk et al., 2000, Radonovich, 2009, Shenal et al., 2011).</p>
<p>· On <strong>27 October</strong> 2020, <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> published "Update Alert 3: Masks for Prevention of Respiratory Virus Infections, Including SARS-CoV-2, in Health Care and Community Settings" (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L20-1292">Chou et al., 2020</a>), to summarize very recent research on masks up until 2 October 2020. The authors noted the serious methodological limitations of the more recent studies and concluded:</p>
<p>The strength of evidence for mask use and risk for SARS-CoV-2 in <em>community settings</em> remained insufficient...Evidence for mask use versus nonuse and comparing masks types in <em>health care settings</em> remained insufficient...There were no new studies on the effectiveness and safety of mask reuse or extended use.</p>

        <p>Here is a little more science for you to enjoy:  </p>
<p>· On <strong>25 September</strong> 2020, the academic journal <em>Frontiers in Medicine</em> published <em>Effectiveness of Surgical Face Masks in Reducing Acute Respiratory Infections in Non-Healthcare Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</em>, by <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.564280/full">(Wang et al., 2020)</a>. The review failed to find a statistically significant effect and concluded:</p>
<p>Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is <strong>not significantly associated</strong> with reduction in ARI [acute respiratory infections] incidence in this meta-review.</p>
<p>· On <strong>22 September</strong> 2020, the academic journal <em>Environmental Research</em> published <em>The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain: Hygiene habits, sociodemographic profile, mobility patterns and comorbidities</em>, by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120311208?via=ihub">(Rodríguez-Barranco et al., 2021)</a>. The authors noted (the quote is from section 5.1. - page 7 of the pdf.):</p>
<p><strong>In the case of masks, the results of this study slightly suggest the opposite effect to that of protection</strong>, possibly due to misuse of masks by the general population untrained in their use.</p>
<p>· On 23 July 2020, <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine</a> has issued an overview of the <em>ongoing</em> research on cloth mask efficacy. The authors stated that:</p>
<p>The increasing polarised and politicised views on whether to wear masks in public during the current COVID-19 crisis hides a bitter truth on the state of contemporary research and the value we pose on clinical evidence to guide our decisions...There is <em>considerable</em> uncertainty as to the value of wearing masks. For instance, <em>high rates of infection with cloth masks could be due to harms caused by cloth masks</em>...The numerous systematic reviews that have been recently published all include the same evidence base so unsurprisingly broadly reach the same conclusions. However, recent reviews <em>using lower quality evidence</em> found masks to be effective...This abandonment of the scientific modus operandi and lack of foresight has left the field wide open for the play of opinions, radical views and political influence.</p>
<p>· <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1435/rr-43">University of Cambridge biomedical scientists have written in 2020 in the British Medical Journal</a>:</p>
<p>The evidence for the effectiveness of face masks in reducing viral transmission is <em>very weak</em>. Few studies examine the use of face masks in community settings; those that do find <em>no evidence of reduced transmission compared with no face masks</em>...Efforts to communicate a position so strongly in favour of widespread use of masks in the community...in the face of persistent evidence gaps, <em>risk promoting policy based more on eminence than evidence</em>. The unintended consequences of unequivocal advocacy of a contested position go beyond the downsides of policy implementation: they include the potential erosion of trust in science more generally, when the measures put forward fail to live up to their promise, or result in problems that could be, or had been, anticipated.</p>
<p>· The gold standard of evidence in biomedical research is the randomized controlled trial. A <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">systematic review</a> of cloth mask research published in 2020 in the academic journal <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em> of the <em>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</em> concluded that:</p>
<p>Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did <em>not</em> support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</p>
<p>· The foregoing finding has been reinforced by a Bayesian analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials. <a href="https://www.qeios.com/read/1SC5L4">Perski et al., 2020</a>, concluded:</p>
<p>Available evidence from RCTs is <em>equivocal</em> as to whether or not wearing face masks in community settings results in a reduction in clinically- or laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections.</p>
<p>· A systematic review by <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1">Brainard et al., 2020</a>, concluded:</p>
<p>The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.</p>
<p>· A systematic review and meta-analysis by <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2">Jefferson et al., 2020</a>, noted:</p>
<p>We included 15 randomised trials investigating the effect of masks (14 trials) in healthcare workers and the general population and of quarantine (1 trial). We found no trials testing eye protection. Compared to no masks there was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50).</p>
<p>· A most recent systematic review of 18 randomized controlled trials and of 11 other systematic reviews by <a href="https://www.cfp.ca/content/66/7/509.abstract">Dugré et al., 2020</a>, concluded:</p>
<p>This systematic review found limited evidence that the use of masks might reduce the risk of viral respiratory infections.</p>
<p>· A systematic review and meta-analysis of potential health risks of face masks by <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20133207v1">Bakhit et al., 2020</a>, concluded that:</p>
<p>There are <em>insufficient data to quantify all of the adverse effects</em> that might reduce the acceptability, adherence, and effectiveness of face masks. New research on facemasks should assess and <em>report the harms and downsides</em>. Urgent research is also needed on methods and designs to mitigate the downsides of facemask wearing, particularly the assessment of alternatives such as face shields.</p>
<p>· A peer-reviewed paper from August 2020 by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09581596.2020.1797997">Martin et al., 2020</a> assessing the overall wisdom of recommending masks for the general public, noted:</p>
<p>There is very limited evidence that cloth face coverings reduce the burden of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19...Few studies examine the use of face coverings in community settings: when taken in aggregate, those that do find no statistically significant evidence of reduced transmission compared with no face coverings...Rather than communicate a falsely unequivocal message about the value of face coverings, researchers should articulate scientific disagreement, the nature of scientific uncertainty, and its implications for how we act to improve knowledge and action.</p>
<p>· The <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-and-masks">World Health Organization</a> admits to this day that:</p>
<p>Non-medical, fabric masks are being used by many people in public areas, but there has been limited evidence on their effectiveness...</p>
<p>· A September 2020 empirical study (preprint) by <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">(van den Broek-Altenburg et al., 2020)</a> highlighted the foolishness of rushing to recommend or mandate masks for the general public. One of the study's key findings was that:</p>
<p>...Wearing a facial mask outside work <strong>increased</strong> probability of COVID-19 infection.</p>

        <p>A couple more studies for you to look over:</p>
<p>· Dr. Jay Bhattacharya (Professor at Stanford University Medical School, a physician, epidemiologist, health economist, and public health policy expert focusing on infectious diseases and vulnerable populations) speaking in <strong>October</strong> 2020 on the topic of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=KG4_ovtHXRo&amp;app=desktop">masks</a>;</p>
<p>· An open letter from <a href="https://docs4opendebate.be/en/open-letter/">September 2020</a> signed by 418 medical doctors states:</p>
<p>...Masks belong in contexts where contacts with proven at-risk groups or people with upper respiratory complaints take place, and in a medical context/hospital-retirement home setting. They reduce the risk of droplet infection by sneezing or coughing. Oral masks in healthy individuals are ineffective against the spread of viral infections. Wearing a mask is not without side effects. Oxygen deficiency (headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of concentration) occurs fairly quickly, an effect similar to altitude sickness. Every day we now see patients complaining of headaches, sinus problems, respiratory problems and hyperventilation due to wearing masks. In addition, the accumulated CO2 leads to a toxic acidification of the organism which affects our immunity. Some experts even warn of an increased transmission of the virus in case of inappropriate use of the mask. Our Labour Code (Codex 6) refers to a CO2 content (ventilation in workplaces) of 900 ppm, maximum 1200 ppm in special circumstances. After wearing a mask for one minute, this toxic limit is considerably exceeded to values that are three to four times higher than these maximum values. Anyone who wears a mask is therefore in an extreme poorly ventilated room. Inappropriate use of masks without a comprehensive medical cardio-pulmonary test file is therefore not recommended by recognised safety specialists for workers. Hospitals have a sterile environment in their operating rooms where staff wear masks and there is precise regulation of humidity / temperature with appropriately monitored oxygen flow to compensate for this, thus meeting strict safety standards.</p>
<p>· Almost 100% of known transmissions of corona happen from extended interaction (home, work, public transit) - you are very unlikely to get it from a stranger passing you by the sidewalk or by a grocery aisle - see <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com./2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>· Cloth masks are ineffective against transmission of COVID-19 through aerosolized respiratory droplets (i.e. smaller droplets &lt;5 μm that remain in the air for hours) and this airborne route of transmission has just been emphasized by many experts to be the most likely primary means of infection. The solutions that would work to address this route are not cloth masks, which can filter only larger droplets (&rt;5 μm), but "social distancing, limiting interaction indoors, avoiding air recirculation, improved natural and artificial ventilation, and innovative engineering solutions which collect and neutralise aerosols to provide clean air in personal and community spaces" (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3206">Wilson et al., 2020</a>). For more details, see also the peer-reviewed <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798">letter to the WHO signed by 239 experts</a>, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167395v1">this paper</a> from August 4, 2020, as well as the corroboration from <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/2430860176/fulltext/C115FCBCDAE64E71PQ/1">(Donaldson, 2020)</a>.</p>
<p>· This <a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/report_little_or_no_benefit_to_widespread_mask_use/11376476">Finnish governmental report</a> concluded that the majority of systematic reviews of empirical studies on mask efficacy found no benefit to wearing masks.</p>
<p>· Data from US areas with widely different frequencies of mask wearing do not support the idea that cloth masks are effective: e.g. <a href="https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/one-month-after-statewide-mask-mandate-california-daily-case-average">California</a> <em>versus</em> <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/arizona-most-anti-mask-state-sees-coronavirus-cases-fall-1519129">Arizona</a>, as of late July 2020. A <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/12/cdc-study-finds-overwhelming-majority-of-people-getting-coronavirus-wore-masks/">CDC study from mid-October</a> 2020 found that "the overwhelming majority of people getting coronavirus wore masks". In <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.21.20208728v2">November 2020</a>, a preprint widely shared on social media as putative evidence that mask mandates in the US have been effective was withdrawn by its authors because the new data - i.e. rising infections in areas with mask mandates - do not support their initial conclusions.</p>
<p>· Oxford University Professor Carl Heneghan explained on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNI2ocgosgA&amp;feature=youtu.be">13 August</a> that UK's recent experience suggests masks for the general public have been ineffective. In a interview from <a href="https://twitter.com/PhilipWatson_/status/1299850554320072706">29 August</a> he stated: "the high quality trial evidence for cloth masks suggest they <strong>increase</strong> your rate of reinfection".</p>
<p>· This analysis from <a href="https://gript.ie/real-talk-have-facemasks-failed/">20 October</a> written by a <a href="https://twitter.com/john_mcguirk/status/1318503851075534849">strong advocate for masks</a>, as well as this <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/j2ys0d/allcause_mortality_during_covid19_no_plague_and_a/g7a64fo/">collection of graphs from around the world</a> depicting number of COVID-19 cases before and after the start of mask mandates strongly suggests that universal wearing of masks has been an ineffective intervention.</p>
<p>· The Beijing Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has re-assessed the evidence and announced that wearing masks outdoors is <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/coronavirus-beijing-announces-wearing-masks-outdoors-not-necessary/articleshow/75787242.cms">not necessary</a>. This change is in line with research at the University of Illinois, Chicago <a href="https://publichealth.uic.edu/news-stories/commentary-masks-for-all-for-covid-19-not-based-on-sound-data/">"Masks-for-all for COVID-19 Not Based on Sound Data"</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">16 July follow-up commentary</a>.</p>

        <p>So whats your solution? More power to the government? 5 masks? The fact is you will never get 100% of the population to comply to a mask mandate. Its not physically possible so they will keep using that excuse to take away more of your freedom until you have none left. Good news tho. Fauci said we might return to normal by 2025 if people bend over a little bit further.</p>

        <p>my solution is quite simple actually: stay six feet apart, and wear a mask just in case you have to come closer. Everyone does that for two weeks and covid will die out on its own. Oh yeah, and people like you get the death sentence while they scream and cry about freedom and their rights</p>

        <p>so some people deserve to die sooner?  That is what a psychopath says in response to having killed someone "we all die one day". So if your family and loved ones died it would be fine because it happens eventually anyway?</p>

        <p>It’s extraordinarily unlikely that someone under 45 who is healthy would have died from Covid-19. If that’s the case it’s a very sad loss. But you can’t just blame anti-maskers without any information on how he contracted it</p>

        <p>anti maskers are the reason it spreads. And as you say now, and always say it is very unlikely for someone his age to die. But some people aren't as lucky as others. He got that slim chance. Doesn't matter how low the chance is, people are dying. hundreds or thousands of innocent americans die every day. He wore a mask while he got groceries and one of you wasn't. and killed him. you killed him, all of you</p>

        <p>The virus spreads in places where people wear masks and in places where people don’t. It may add a small layer of protection, but it isn’t magic - this is an airborne virus. There’s no evidence this person was “killed” by a non-mask wearer, and blaming it on a Reddit community is logically incoherent</p>

        <p>It's real, very few on this sub deny that. It's the moving goal posts, the endless lockdowns, no mask/mask/wear 2 or 3 masks, schools on half-assed schedules, depression, suicides,  and self-righteous , insecure, insignificant Karens like yourself who think they're morally superior for suddenly being pro-life - that's what most here are opposed to, Karen.</p>
