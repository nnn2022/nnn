        <p>&rt; When I was offered Covid vaccination by my GP, I asked him which it was he was offering me. He thought they were all the same until I explained that there are 7 technological approaches being employed in the making of the 214 vaccine candidates that were in the pipeline or had reached emergency authorisation in December 2020. This impression of homogeneity has been allowed to be glibly glossed over in the mass immunisation programme. </p>
<p>Imagine that random people on Reddit who don't even have related educational backgrounds can understand basic differences that TrUsTeD mEdIcAl ExPeRtS do not even know exist. Unbelievable!</p>
