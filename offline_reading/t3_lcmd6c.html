    <strong>Dealing with Trolls</strong>
    <p><p>I know it’s tempting to argue with and insult the folks from the Covidiots sub when they come on here—I’ve done it a few times—but I really think we should stop interacting with them. We all need to let out our frustrations and it’s easier if we have a target to attack behind the anonymity this platform allows, but if we stopped giving them the attention they are so desperately seeking I’m sure they’ll lose interest. They want a fight, they want drama to screenshot and repost on their sub.</p>
<p>In the future can we just make more of a collective effort to ignore them? We aren’t changing their minds and they do not come here out of a genuine interest to hear our side. We don’t need to make the same arguments over and over or waste our time compiling links that support our position.</p>
<p>I already recently made this point in a comment on another post, but I figured I’d go ahead since there’s just been another troll. I’m just downvoting their posts and blocking those users… attention whores don’t deserve my time, I don’t know about y’all. Being denied the attention they seek is more infuriating to them than getting insulted.</p></p>
