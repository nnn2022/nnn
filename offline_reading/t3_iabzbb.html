    <strong>The Effects of Participatory Propaganda In The " New Normal " Described</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/jyzg7j6x/release/2">https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/jyzg7j6x/release/2</a> </p>
<p>One may argue that propaganda has become less interested in changing people’s opinion about a specific object or in convincing people that it is either truth or fiction. The main purpose of 21st century propaganda is to increase the scope of participation in relation to the object of propaganda. In a digital environment relying on user participation, propaganda is a technology of power that drives the socialization of conflicts and a tool for increasing the scope of contagion. While participation in political debates is often considered to be an important feature of democracy, propaganda allows us to define the structure and form of participation in a way that serves only those who generate propaganda, and minimizing the constructive outcomes of participation. In addition, the focus on propaganda as a driver of participation could be considered a meeting point between political and commercial interests, since increasing engagement with a given object of content is a path towards more pageviews and more surrender of personal data. In that sense, propaganda serves not only the deep state, but also the platform owners.</p>
<p>Over the last century, propaganda has gradually moved from open squares and public places to our homes. As a consequence, propaganda infiltrates our most intimate spaces, where users interact with their laptops and mobile devices. The location of technological interaction is not simply the household, but the bed or sofa — spaces commonly associated with relaxation and entertainment. Propaganda moves from the living room to the bedroom, follows people as they travel to work on crowded public transport, and remains with them in office time. We can wake up and fall asleep with propaganda in our hands. It finds us at the university, in the bathroom or on the beach.</p>
<p>The integration of content generation/sharing and content discussion creates an immersive effect whereby users are unable to separate content consumption (and its impact on their lives) from their personal communication. In online environments, the consumption of propaganda is deeply embedded in the structure of social relations, which allows the propaganda to further infiltrate our everyday lives. More important are the ways social media and the spread of online content create opportunities for immediate action: spreading propaganda further, or taking other actions directly suggested by the propaganda.</p></p>

        <p>Also would like to give a shout out to Sharyl's new book coming out in November, it's gonna be a banger, she goes in deep and exposes the propaganda networks from the inside...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Slanted-Media-Taught-Censorship-Journalism/dp/0062974696">https://www.amazon.ca/Slanted-Media-Taught-Censorship-Journalism/dp/0062974696</a> </p>
<p>Virtually every piece of information you get through the media has been massaged, shaped, curated, and manipulated before it reaches you. Some of it is censored entirely. The news can no longer be counted on to reflect all the facts. Instead of telling us what happened yesterday, they tell us what’s new in the prepackaged soap opera they’ve been calling the news. </p>
<p>Most frightening of all, a broad campaign in the media has convinced many Americans not only to accept but to demand censorship over journalism. It is a stroke of genius on the part of those seeking to influence public opinion: undermine public confidence in the news, then  insist upon “curating” information and divining the “truth.” The thinking is done for you. They’ll decide which pesky facts shouldn’t cross your desk by declaring them false, irrelevant, debunked, unsafe, or out-of-bounds.</p>
<p>We have reached a state of utter absurdity, where journalism schools teach students that their own, personal truth or chosen narratives matter more than reality. In <em>Slanted</em>, Attkisson digs into the language of propagandists, the persistence of false media narratives, the driving forces behind today's dangerous blend of facts and opinion, the abandonment of journalism ethics, and the new, Orwellian definition of what it means to report the news. </p>

        <p>Its peer pressure, no different than "if all your friends are doing it you should too." It's the exact opposite of what we tell children, with the bridge question, "if everyone is jumping off a bridge would you jump too?" Its almost like society is imploding and regressing.</p>

        <p>Global societies are regressing cause the propaganda networks have stepped their game up hard in 2020, the marketing campaign for the lockdown hoax is all day every day everywhere in your face with masks and clown laws being enacted by the week.</p>
<p>I think once people really understand that main stream media, social media and the internet is general are strictly tools for propaganda and brain washing for what ever the agenda of the moment is. A lot of people got woke to this in 2020, but still many more need to open their eyes and realize reality for what it is, almost everything seems to be socially engineered...</p>
