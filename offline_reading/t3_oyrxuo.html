    <strong>Why are they not vaccinating the 3rd world countries?</strong>
    <p><p>So I was excited today to be able to have a civil and constructive conversation with a provaccination friend of mine who mostly believes the general narrative.</p>
<p>She, however, is intelligent and together we like to discuss and build on each others theories and ideas. </p>
<p>I havent settled on any certain theory, but definitely lean towards believing that this is a reset scheme as the resources cant sustain our population etc. </p>
<p>But my friend raised a very good question: if this was a grand reset scheme using the vaccinations to eliminate the population, why would they target the western countries? Why arent africans and asians and other third world countries the main targets as realistically the supposed 'elite' would probably prefer a whiter world, so why would they eliminate Europe and other western countries so effectively?</p></p>

        <p>Because it’s all about money and conditioning. Third world countries can’t afford to buy the vaccines—they depend on others buying and donating it for them. They’re not exactly reliable/profitable customers for Big Pharma, so they’re not top targets. And politicians have nothing to gain from conditioning another country to accept tyranny.</p>

        <p>So i dont buy into that narrative , i think the vaccines are dangerous for what they are, untested, unproven genetic treatments etc etc</p>
<p>However, if i was to subscribe to the theory then targeting western civilisation first would be done to remove the main area of opposition</p>
<p>If, for example millions started dying off in India and Africa even the most obstinate of people could not overlook it and governments could not deny it, if you remove the potential opposition first and get rid of the those who have the ability to stop your plans you can then go about happily decimating the large third world populations with little or no prospect of being halted</p>

        <p>They’ve tested tons of drugs on Africa, how often have you heard about that?</p>
<p>These vaccines aren’t going to kill millions of people, African or otherwise. </p>
<p>Asia has already been conditioned to accept communism/social credit. The East was first, not the West. See Mao, and modern China. </p>
<p>The west is last. </p>
<p>African and third world countries have been left alone as far as COVID vaccines because the vaccines are about getting western societies to volunteer their civil liberties. That’s ALL the vaccines are about. Pfizer, J&amp;J and whoever the hell else, currently enjoy carte blanche in Africa. They’ll all get vaccinated soon enough.</p>

        <p>I have a different interpretation...Middle east 3rd world countries are at their 3rd dose ! But the difference with the western countries is that they all believe the narrative so there is very very very little resistance...so they vaccinate them all...I have news from Morocco Turkey they even don t need to make it mandatory because people are obeying....when goverment says all health givers vaccinate yourself BOOOM all of them obey maybe a few people are resisting....so in western countries they have to FORCE people because communication mind manipulation IS NOT ENOUGH...</p>
<p>That s why this hoax first started in Asia (succeeded) then middle east (succeeded) then Italy-France-Spain (some resistance) then UK (lots of resistance)...lastly italy-spain-France finally ended up understanding the hoax which is a big problem for them that is why in France EVEN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL CUNCIL validated the law project of Macron the dictator...the paradox is this law is ANTI CONSTITUTIONAL !</p>
<p>How can a constitional cuncil can validate a anti-constitituonal law ?</p>
<p>ANSVER : There is no constitution no law no human rights that work ANYMORE BECAUSE these guys who want to impose us this vaccine and delete all our liberties are in fact A MAFIA / A CULT !</p>

        <p>Maybe not, but that hasn’t stopped colonizers/big pharma/militias funded by (insert first world power here)  from stomping all over various African countries. Africa for the most part doesn’t have any civil liberties to hand over - western countries do.</p>

        <p>&rt;why would they target the western countries</p>
<p>Power in the West is being/has been transferred to a network of corporate globalists. The most likely people to resist this are long-term citizens, mostly of European heritage, who believe they should have national sovereignty and personal freedom. Lessening their numbers, and their proportion of the population, lessens their collective power. This is why mass migration is also being pushed.</p>
<p>&rt;realistically the supposed 'elite' would probably prefer a whiter world</p>
<p>I wouldn't assume this given that the elites are promoting critical race theory, BLM, mass migration from Africa and the Middle East, etc. They prefer an obedient world and may believe some demographics to be easier to control than others. The Economist, for example, has expressed satisfaction at the prospect of native UK ethnicities getting smaller proportionally over time, for example.</p>

        <p>Kind of advanced question even if it seems simple. Thus, the answer can't be simple even more <em>for the uninitiated into the theories</em>.</p>
<p>A grand reset scheme will require all the world, not only racial agenda or only 3rd world countries - a grand reset will require going big and knowing what you do.</p>
<p>Supposed that killing of the people through the vax would have been the only or the most important target of this pandemic, it would have been to obvious to only target the 3rd world countries. So the "security" aspect of them doing that vs. let's say the supposed racial agenda, far surpass the supposed racial agenda.</p>
<p>Another one, would have been the production of the vaxes selectively, for 1st world countries, 2nd, 3rd, etc. - so different "batches" - very complex to pull it world wide in this way.</p>
<p><em>Fasten Your Tin Belts!</em></p>
<p>Firstly, there are more agendas at work with this pandemic. Some "obvious", others not so obvious. To the theorist, they are mostly obvious. To the "educated" society person POV, not so obvious.</p>
<p>OK, so we now elevated a bit the POV from which we can now oversee the problem in a much broader view.</p>
<p>The reset is based on technologies that were developed covertly under military applications and "special programs". This means our world using old technologies (petrol and other burned fuel resources) was artificially sustained that way with the knowing of other technologies that were actively developed and suppressed in the same time (in order to maintain control over them).</p>
<p>Those technologies that were and are suppressed could be run only by a handful of people to basically run the whole world - this right here answer your/one answer question.</p>
<p>The vax could have been specifically designed with the new mrna tech to kill the people <em>by design as a "mistake"</em> given by a <em>supposed</em> deadly pandemic. Not instant kill, but something more progressive - the vax being the real deadly "pandemic". (0 to 3 years spike protein - Dr Charles Hoffe)</p>
<p>Causing pregnancy problem. So also depopulation through infertility.</p>
<p>Based on the false virus psychosis and the aftermath vax manipulation, they also pushed for the vax mandate through the mandating of health passports! The "pandemic" situation alone it's such a mess, that basically every lie they launch justify another measure they take.</p>
<p>So with all this mess and destruction they gradually pull up new technologies as "a solution" to "the problem". We already seen pull up two; gene editing medicine (test and vax) and digital human identification (vax digital "health" pass).</p>
<p>It's a gradual depopulation worldwide where the vax was distributed, with many other agendas running in the background that sustain this scenario created by them.</p>
<p>Basically all the conspiracies now come together. 🤔</p>

        <p>The news reported several months ago that countries like Argentina were being bullied by Pfizer et al. to sign supply contracts that required putting up state assets as collateral and give them legal immunity. But residents of 3rd world countries don't necessarily enjoy the same level of freedom or welfare as in the west, and it might be easier to keep dissidents under control. Places like Israel and Gibraltar are the most interesting test grounds though.</p>

        <p>It's a good question and one of the reasons that I don't believe this is some kind of population control exercise, although I'm still not convinced that we know enough to say that the vaccines aren't going to have a negative effect on fertility. </p>
<p>I truly believe this is just an episode of mass hysteria that the government is using to enhance their power, either purposefully or because they legitimately believe what they are doing is right (which, God help us is somehow both worse and more likely).</p>
<p>I am struggling with why the Dems in the US are pushing vaccination and the zero case goal so hard, the best I can come up with is a way to score political points (we got everyone vaxxed, we beat Covid, etc.) ahead of the mid-terms. And possibly they are controlled by big-pharma (which I am sure some are). </p>
<p>What I don't understand and I hope anyone who reads this could help me out with, is why are the Europeans pushing this so harshly? Is there a political outcome they are trying to achieve? Best I got there is it's somehow tied to keeping EU proponents in power, but then you have the UK/Canada/Australia.....</p>
<p>Third world countries don't have time to deal with Covid and the propaganda, if they want their populations to comply they just use brute force. Plus, they have more important things to do, like figuring out the best way to steal as much money from their people and international organizations.</p>

        <p>Yeah, i think it is about money and greed. I dont buy the depopulation narrative. 
But I do struggle to explain the mandatory vaccine orders for an experimental technology. That part I cannot explain. It makes no sense at all unless you start thinking about a kind of medical fascist state. But even still, makes more sense to have safe vaccines from this point of view. Maybe it is a mix of money/greed and control/fascist tendencies.
Either way, I think this will fail in the medium term. The "west" may well be commiting a kind of suicide now with all this nonsense. 
Suppresion of ivermectin by itself is a crime against humanity which people will realise in the next month.  That will be interesting as the cognitive dissonance explodes peoples minds. We will have a very angry, populace seeking new approaches to politics and healthcare all over the westetn world</p>

<p>Personally my wife and I find it more than a bit off-putting that for all the talk of equity diversity and inclusion, being global citizens and treating all countries' citizens as equals, that the vaccines that we are sharing with the 3rd world are essentially all AstraZeneca doses that we've deemed unsafe for our own citizens.</p>
<p>Not that we don't think governments should look out for their own citizens first we absolutely think that, but the hypocrisy rankles.</p>

        <p>Because no one is trying to kill off a bunch of people. At most there will be reproductive issues in the future, and you can just import people to make up for that. And even better those folks you import would be happy with a fraction of the niceties and conveniences westerners are accustomed to. It’s a win win, and there’s no overt genocide along the way.</p>
