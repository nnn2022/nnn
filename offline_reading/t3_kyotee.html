    <strong>Is it me or the people that should be most rational are actually the most irrational? (Atheists,educated people)</strong>
    <p><p>Atheists seem to blindly follow their new religion of "science". and it doesn't matter what those scientists or experts will say. they will always accept their words as holy words from god and will bash any heretics (skeptics) and will say that they are uneducated and anti science.</p>
<p>Im non religious, Used to be atheist but now Im just agnostic because I realized that there is more out there than what I thought and nothing is ever black and white. but that's not the point.</p>
<p>the point is that people who used to be skeptics those who always criticized government, religion different institutions even big pharma. are now blindly following the TPTB agenda without realizing that they are being played.</p>
<p>on the other hand the people that usually seem to be the most stupid are the ones who are asking the questions</p>
<p>whats going on!? clown world and its getting more ridiculous by the day</p></p>

        <p>You're probably wise enough to figure this out as an agnostic, but some atheists are so un-self aware that they don't realize they are just as faithful as the religious they claim to know more than. It's just as simple as asking, what do you believe or think happens after you die? If they don't say I don't know then ask how they know that. Get to the root cause of the reason why. Every single reason why will be rooted in faith on the side of the atheist. The only truly reasonable and rational religious critic is the agnostic who admit they do not know anything about anything and remain a fence sitter. And really, there is more to be said about the religious because at least they have books to point to. The atheist just has whatever they shat into their hand and really is MORE faithful in their beliefs than the religious, because at least honest religious people sometimes have questions. The scientist, the real scientist is a curious agnostic in search of deeper understanding. The atheist is the lazy one.</p>

        <p>it was primed by the trump hate fest circle jerk bible study that was the last 4 years.  And once trump staked a position as less than hyper vigilant about covid, the correct position was to oppose that.  nyt/vox/wapo/cnn piled on, and now you have 20 and 30 yo’s masking in cars and not seeing anyone for months at a time.  fucking crazy.  you also have the creative class mostly supporting censorship, because it currently vibes with their leanings and prejudices.</p>

        <p>Atheism or education doesn't mean you're not gullible. </p>
<p>It's a difference between understanding and believing. 
If you're an atheist because you believe what scientists tell you then you're just as religious as theists.</p>

        <p>On average higher education correlates with gullibility. Reason is that those who are the least gullible know to steer away from education before they get infected by the doctrines. Those who manage to shrug off the indoctrination ( =education) and continue on to academic endeavors have to either be incredibly strong mentally or they must already have lost the battle for individual thought.</p>

        <p>Education != intelligence.<br>
When we look at the definition of intelligence we can state that a fancy dude with a bachelor of sciences can be more "dumb" than your neighbour that works at the grocery store:<br>
Intelligence has been defined in many  ways: the capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning,  emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking,  and problem-solving. <br>
Some educated persons might lack several of those traits.</p>

        <p>Same here.</p>
<p>I will add that many people identify as atheists because of the "I fucking love science" herd mentality and the trend towards atheism because it is now associated with being a hard-core liberal (a term I hate to use because I think politics is bullshit, so I am open to alternative terms but I'm tired right now and low effort today hah). Which is ironic since these people treat the new Science^TM like the bible.</p>

        <p>I used to call myself an atheist until I realized it was more accurate to call myself agnostic. It's not that I 100% believe there is no god. It's that I don't give af whether there is one or not. If there's a term for someone who doesn't care one way or the other, let me know. </p>
<p>I know non religious and also Christians who are questioning everything. The Christians seem to be following Trump. The non religious seem to be following conspiracy theories. I don't know about all of the conspiracy theories those friends are throwing out, but shit just isn't adding up and I'm a little concerned things ARE going to get worse instead of better. But mostly I try and focus on the now so that I don't get too bent out of shape and struggle to function.</p>

        <p>Something I noticed about educated liberals is they have a disconnected inner alarm system due to having been trained to disconnect and disregard it. For example, if you say 'I have a bad feeling about this' they'll usually tell you that you're worrying for nothing, that they are sure the person doesn't mean it, that maybe you should see your doctor for anxiety. They don't trust their gut feeling and they disregard other people's gut feelings too. They often roll their eyes and mock anyone who is spiritual or religious or has a bad feeling about something  believing they are superior because they follow The Science™ (ignoring or being ignorant of the fact that The Science is often created by people paid by a handful of billionaires to discover a pre decided outcome).</p>
<p>It's an arrogant stance where they put all their trust in the government, the education system and the media rather than trusting their own instincts or those of their friends and family. </p>
<p>An 'uneducated' but smart person is much more likely to trust their own judgement.</p>

        <p>I think most atheists are a little more skeptical of everything than you give them credit for. The only “Doomers” I know are Christians. I’m an atheist and I’m one of the least doomer people you will find. Do I believe in the scientific method? Yes? Do I believe all scientific claims? Fuck no!</p>

        <p>Many Christians I know (mostly the very conservative ones of a particular denomination) think this is all overblown over politics and don't trust the vaccine. Some of them though, particularly elderly take this virus very seriously (most in my family are this way).</p>
<p>I myself am somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>One of my friends is atheist and somewhat liberal, and he believes in wearing a mask but isn't much worried about the virus itself or lockdowns.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the reason the atheists are doomer over this is they tend to lean toward the democrat view of things (big gov, gov should help the people, basically be what the Christian church used to do) and they believe that the government has failed, and of the course the biggest issue is Trump is the main failure in this, and it's a great way to show how much worse Orange Man Bad is.</p>

        <p>I've been thinking about this recently: religion is no longer as prominent as it used to be, but without knowing it, people have created a new sort of modern religion. The cultist 'science' is a big part of this. So these people saying they're superior for being atheist are actually thinking in a way that's far more irrational than religion can sometimes be, and what's more it's not even bringing the positives of religion. As a whole, I've noticed that the people I looked up to have gotten caught up the worst in this whole scam.</p>

        <p>It is weird. I was an atheist the first 25 years of my life. The big man in the sky thing never added up to me. Since science involved math, which I always trust, I trusted scientists on face value. I first noticed the religion of “science” a few years back when I realized I was blindly taking scientists word for everything without doing the math myself just as a devout Christian would in church. Once the hypocrisy dawned on me I started getting skeptical. I couldn’t shake the feeling that science can be just as crooked as organized religion. They say what’s profitable because nobody fact checks them and if you actually do and find inaccuracies they turn you into a looney tune.</p>

        <p>My take:</p>
<p>There are plenty of anti-lockdown atheists. I'm one, in both cases because I came to the conclusion based on my own sense of logic and life experience. But the same kind of people who yell "haha the bible is a fairytale" all over the internet are the same people yelling "haha anti-lockdown people are Trump worshippers who are all gonna die of covid" all over the internet, because quite simply, some people are waaaaay too invested in pwning people over the internet and getting internet virtue points from their peers who all buy the same groupthink they do.</p>
<p>As for educated people: many think the act of going to college automatically means they're good at critical thinking, and thus never think critically about anything again. The more elite the school, the more likely this is. Because why use logic or scientific studies to prove your point when you can simply assume your degree makes you smarter and therefore right? Meanwhile, those without degrees are dealing with the real world under harsher conditions and never got a 4 year vacation from it. Their political opinions are more likely to be formed from actual life experience, rather than whatever the latest fad is.</p>

        <p>I follow the work of someone called Mark Passio. He talks about natural law etc. He used to be a priest in the church of Satan and learned a lot about the elite and different things throughout the years. He says there's people who are left brain imbalanced. This means you only are able to see the world in concrete, scientific terms. People who are right brain unbalanced are only able to view the world in spiritual &amp; emotional terms. To be completely balanced, you have to take in both sides. </p>
<p>Anyone interested in listening to his podcasts, the website is whatonearthishappening.com. His YouTube channel is under Mark Passio.</p>

        <p>A lot of people follow atheism as a form of rebellion against their catholic parents. Notice how a lot of the time atheists talk more about god more than a Christian would? Atheism is unfortunately now a trend and a lot of people turn into atheists because they want to be “quirky”. Atheists may seem like skeptics at first, but the truth is that for many atheists gullibility to the anti-religious MSM (Religious ideals usually go against the MSM agenda) is what lead them to Atheism in the first place.</p>
