        <p>And it won't change a thing. They are passing a law that makes legally challenging these insane measures impossible.</p>
<p>I'm a middle aged, middle-everything nobody living in Germany, but even I came to the conclusion that in order to actually change something, you need a (maybe silent) majority behind you, and that's simply not the case in Germany. The majority of Germans see these protesters as virus spreading, anti-social, right-wing extremist, conspiracy theorist scum, and many openly demand them to be placed in quarantine camps and denied medical treatment in case they catch the flu. The majority of Germans demand even <em>more</em> and <em>stricter</em> measures. </p>
<p>There's a saying you can't do a revolution in Germany because first of all, it's prohibited to step on the lawn, and second, there's no form for that.</p>

<p>That is the only way this will stop. People seem to be naive that protests will do anything. If anything, protests might go against us because violence, riots and looting can happen very easily which will play into governments hands even more.</p>
<p>I've said it many times, the only way to stop this is non compliance to the rules by the millions.</p>

        <p>I agree, but then there's the patriot act danger of senseless and endless biosecurity theater looming. Even if people stop caring and go about their lives practically in noncompliance with the most intrusive measures, say, curfews, or human contact rules, we might still have to live with permanent chin masks, immunity passports for travel, temperature checks at mall entrances, signs and symbols everywhere, and other generic pandemic-reminders. </p>
<p>The only way this truly stops is when a vast majority becomes a vital threat to the politicians re-election due to single issue voting. And I don't see this happening anytime soon.</p>

        <p>From what you observe would you say it's all too late? </p>
<p>I have hope but I must admit it is dwindling fast as the months move on. The vast majority just don't seen to be waking up fast enough.</p>

        <p>I think there is hope as all this theater, at least in western Europe, is financially built on sand. The moment the actual, tangible personal and financial consequences outweigh the benefits of virtue signalling, it's over. The moment the majority of saturated, western WFH-people painfully feels the financial consequences of those decisions they once feverishly supported is the moment the torches and pitchforks come out.</p>
<p>I don't think, the government even of super wealthy Germany, can do this much longer than early next year. And once the hush money dries up, this mass psychosis is going to end.</p>

        <p>The only thing keeping it all from unravelling is structural confusion and despair. The European economies, among others, are already living on borrowed time. When this starts imploding over the next six months, it will be truly massive.</p>

        <p>that is not true.</p>
<p>the number of people waking up and actively fighting the insanity is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>this german video has a nice graph in it showing the number of querdenken initiatives, that went from 17 in june to 126 in oktober and keeps rising.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUN3n38XABY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUN3n38XABY</a> </p>
<p>if you still watch ANY mainstream media, then remember, that all of it is propaganda to push the lie of people being fine with the dystopian nightmare mostly.</p>
<p>they deliberately lied about the demonstration on the 1.august in berlin claiming, that it was 17000 people and a loud minority, while in reality it was 100000s.</p>
<p>don't fall for defeatism propaganda.</p>

        <p>I'll believe it when I see it.</p>
<p>I'm not a defeatist, but I do believe you need a majority of people behind you to officially win over a political argument like Covid unquestionably is. And I simply don't see that happening. I myself am more leaning towards clandestine resistance, counterintelligence and sabotage more than hoping the movement will gain mentionable momentum. Lead by example.</p>
<p>I said it elsewhere on this sub but I'm a firm believer that this crisis will be ended not with a vaccine or winning a political debate, but with pitchforks and molotov cocktails, unfortunately.</p>

        <p>The real question is, is that what ordinary Germans are asking, or is that what the MSM and bots are making it out to look like, in turn, making real people believe it as well?</p>

        <p>I genuinely think that's what the ordinary German believes, or, has been made believe. It just matches with my daily interactions and observations, it matches with anonymous polls, it matches with the ratio of comments in the commentary sections.</p>
<p>Of course I am not a social science expert and my view is of course anecdotal and subjective. I don't even think this particular situation is steady or eternal; just now it looks like that. People are still too saturated and unaffected by the situation to flip or really care.</p>
