        <p>The WHO sets their masking age at 12. The CDC sets it at 2. Probably not coincidentally, the CDC is aiming to eventually make 2 the minimum COVID vaccination age.</p>

        <p>It all is pretty related. Demanding that 2 year olds mask in order to create the impression that 2 year olds are at risk of COVID,  so that way people will eventually get their 2 year olds vaccinated for COVID.</p>

        <p>But you get most vaccinations by then, they wouldnt do it if it was dangerous for kids. So it shouldnt upset you so much. You were injected with like 15+ vaccines as a kid. Those choices are made by people who've spent years studying to become specialists in all kinds of healthcare, pediatric and virology. Anything goes bad they are public figures and can be prosecuted. I dont see what's so upsetting? Here come the downvotes for saying normal things. What a world.</p>

        <p>A great point I was about to make.  Instead of the downvotes people, how about a logical response? I'd rather have to not get a vaccine as well but the reality is it's the best we can do at this point. If we want to drastically reduce the likelihood of such things in the future there are steps we can take related to our exploitation of the planet, yet most are unaware/unwilling to do so, so I suggest yall get used to the band aids that vaccines are.</p>
<p>I think we can all relate to witnessing what we consider bad parenting, but children wearing a facemask in public for 1-2 hours a day a few days a week for 1-2 years is the least of our worries. The significant problems are in plain sight. A major one I struggle with witnessing on a daily basis is the terrible example our culture sets for kids in regards to diet. The mass marketing of junk food, and parents lack of understanding on the importance and preveleance od the issue. Could add to the list all sorts of other poverty related issues such as poor education and social support, or even the dangers of social media on the youth. These are the areas we should be focusing on. The mask thing has been marketed as a big hot button issue and too many are taking the bait. Breaks my heart to see so many of us misdirecting our passion like this...especially when described with such expressions like "punch parents in the face". </p>
<p>Please people, back to the basics here. Yes, pandemics suck, but going forward, there are things we can do to limit them, yet for now, gotta get through it. 1 in 6 children live in poverty in our country! Childhood obesity over tripled in last 40 years! Teen suicide rate in U.S is at record levels! The list goes on. Please don't be distracted by the masks.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this considerate, well worded and above all truthful point. People tend to lose themselves in hysteria, panic and outrage, when there are much worse problems in the world than having to wear a face mask. I couldnt agree with you more.</p>

        <p>Why stop at 2? Why not make it when the kid is born? Or maybe invent a special syringe that can vaccinate a baby before birth? Or how about a special vaccine for the night conception takes place. You can't be too careful with COVID!!!!!</p>
<p>My cracks aside... This is very troubling. These points aren't original to me, but it's worth repeating: We don't have long term data about these vaccines. Kids may be taking extra risk, since their bodies are still growing/developing. Kids also have the issue of more years ahead of them that could be compromised.</p>

        <p>My kids are young and the things I see amongst their peers makes me so sad.  </p>
<p>One mother at camp pick up casually mentions that her kid (5 or 6) comes home ravenous because they have lunch inside (and by ‘inside’ I mean a big open hut thing with no walls) and he is scared to take off his mask to eat.  </p>
<p>This is so normalized here that I am the weirdo for being upset by it.</p>
<p>I have done my best to keep my kids in every normal activity available and to travel as much as we could while explaining the masks that get forced on them in some places as ‘making freaked out people feel better’ so I like to think they will ok but they are going to grow up with peers with massive issues and I am scared for them to be around the fallout.</p>

        <p>I think the guideline in my area is that one is supposed to wear a mask unless vaccinated. But I'm glad that I'm seeing plenty of kids who are too young for the vaccines who don't have a mask on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I see plenty of kids with a mask on who are with (presumably vaccinated) mask-less parents. And I bet those parents will be the first to embrace vaccination when it's available for 8 year olds...</p>
<p>And I've speculated that one of the reasons why they suggest masks for the unvaccinated is to give incentive to vaccinate kids when the vaccines are available. Heck, even kids who DESPISE needles might welcome a couple of jabs if it frees them from a mask.</p>

        <p>What gets me is seeing parents maskless and their four little kids muzzled up and miserable. I want to slap them for how abusive and evil they’re being. How can you force your children to do something and not even do it yourself? You’re setting them up to never trust you and to resent everyone around them.</p>

        <p>All these f*ckers need to get thrown in jail. How many kids died from Covid vs How many kids with developmental disabilities and those at risk for abuse will have shortened lifespans? Because trauma and poverty kills quality of life and shortens life span. </p>
<p>This is immoral. Any ethics committee gathers intel and approves a human study even if it's a questionnaire. And this is okay, to inject non-FDA approved medicine/shots to kids?</p>
