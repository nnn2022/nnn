<p>That‚Äôs a common misconception. </p>
<p>COVID-19 particles are around 0.125 microns, but they are always bonded to something larger. There isn‚Äôt naked virus particles expelling from your body.</p>
<p>The virus attaches to water droplets or aerosols that are generated by breathing, talking, coughing, etc. These consist of water, mucus protein and are all larger than 1 micron. </p>
<p>So yes, masks do provide a protective layer to reduce the amount of droplets entering the air. The effectiveness of the mask depends on the material. If you can‚Äôt get a medical mask, multi-layer cloth masks still offer some protection.</p>

        <p>From literally the source you linked...
"We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org)1 as support for discrediting widespread masking. In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less. It is apparent that many people with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic or presymptomatic yet highly contagious and that these people account for a substantial fraction of all transmissions.2,3 Universal masking helps to prevent such people from spreading virus-laden secretions, whether they recognize that they are infected or not.4</p>
<p>We did state in the article that ‚Äúwearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection,‚Äù but as the rest of the paragraph makes clear, we intended this statement to apply to passing encounters in public spaces, not sustained interactions within closed environments. A growing body of research shows that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is strongly correlated with the duration and intensity of contact: the risk of transmission among household members can be as high as 40%, whereas the risk of transmission from less intense and less sustained encounters is below 5%.5-7 This finding is also borne out by recent research associating mask wearing with less transmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in closed settings.8 We therefore strongly support the calls of public health agencies for all people to wear masks when circumstances compel them to be within 6 ft of others for sustained periods."</p>

        <p>The flimsy blue masks and 1 layer cloth masks offer little protection. Medical masks are obviously preferable but if you can‚Äôt get them, multi-layer masks offer more protection.</p>
<p>You also need to handle them and dispose of them properly. Constantly touching and reusing them is counterproductive.</p>

        <p>I read the articles, a few notes:</p>
<p>https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy</p>
<p>&rt; Furthermore, the relevant known physics and biology, which I review, are such that masks and respirators should not work. It would be a paradox if masks and respirators worked, given what we know about viral respiratory diseases: The main transmission path is long-residence-time aerosol particles (&lt; 2.5 Œºm), which are too fine to be blocked, and the minimum-infective dose is smaller than one aerosol particle.</p>
<p>Virus particles bond to water droplets or aerosols that are generated by breathing, talking, coughing, etc. These droplets are larger than 1 micron. There aren‚Äôt any naked virus particles just floating around. </p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20200605090916/https://www.oralhealthgroup.com/features/face-masks-dont-work-revealing-review/
A deleted blog from 2016. It doesn‚Äôt actually prove that masks don‚Äôt work, it just says they need more research on surgical masks. </p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372
It doesn‚Äôt say that masks don‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs saying they‚Äôre less effective in a community setting vs. a hospital where you have a gown, gloves, and eye protection. That‚Äôs kind of a given. If you want more protection feel free to wear goggles.</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/?fbclid=IwAR0Uev3X3h3TZnpGBGP5Q5Mz6NmDdrJ5ektPdKK5k5sbTfAouBkyz8_aCzE#!po=87.5000
The article is from June so more research has been done. </p>
<p>&rt; Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 (COVID‚Äê19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7‚Äâdays. Thus, a pre‚Äêsymptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others. </p>
<p>The fact that surgical and cloth masks offer <em>no</em> protection is disputed by other studies. https://msphere.asm.org/content/5/5/e00637-20</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/</p>
<p>&rt; The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of cloth masks to medical masks in hospital healthcare workers (HCWs). The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between medical masks and cloth masks.</p>
<p>The study was of healthcare workers in high risk wards. Obviously healthcare workers shouldn‚Äôt use cloth masks.</p>
<p>https://archive.org/details/covid-censorship-at-research-gate-2/page/2/mode/2up
This is a story about an article that was removed from ResearchGate. It was called ‚ÄúMasks don‚Äôt work: a review of science relevant to COVID-19 social policy‚Äù. It was removed because it had ‚Äúquestionable scientific basis‚Äù. The author is the guy from the first link.</p>
<p>https://off-guardian.org/2020/09/23/is-evidence-masks-dont-work-being-purged-from-the-internet/
Again, this article doesn‚Äôt prove that masks don‚Äôt work, it just complains about the second article being removed from the internet.</p>
