    <strong>No sense of self-preservation...</strong>
    <p><p>When you willingly subject yourself to new experimental vaccines, especially when you have been informed of other options, or when you are not at risk. </p>
<p>But as much as I guilt myself over not “doing enough” to inform others of the risks of these vaccines... I know that <em>fear</em> is what got them into this mess—something tells me that <em>fear</em> (of adverse effects) won’t get them out of it.</p>
<p>But I don’t know what will.  What can even be done for those who have taken it?</p></p>

        <p>And use the FLCCC protocols needed.  I got Ivermectin in case friends and family have side effects from the vaccine or wind up as breakthrough cases.  And as a prophylactic for me, since I'm unvaxxed.</p>

        <p>I got the vaccine and have experienced literally no side effects, not even arm pain. Don't see why everyone doesn't want to take it, maybe they just have a fear of needles.</p>

        <p>I studied mathematics. Dont understand why almost everyone else sucks at it, maybe they are just stupid?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Maybe it is because the numbers put forward by pharma companies and health "authorities" dont add up?</p>
<p>Maybe it is because I simply refuse to acknowledge anything that comes from ignorant arrogance as is the case with "modern health" in general?</p>
<p>I really wouldnt mind a proper talk on vaccines. But as it is, the "health community" pretends to know everything and to not make mistakes. This is a ridiculus stance given how often doctors dont know what to do, how many illness cant be properly treated, how many "civilization illness" spike, etc. pp.</p>
<p>If the "health community" would come forward and admit that they actually know very little, that few published research is worth the paper it is written on, I might be inclinced to be more trustfull towards them.</p>
<p>As it is, the "health community" is provably full of scummy scammers who want your money more than your health.</p>
