    <strong>Anyone else actually think that viruses are a GOOD thing?</strong>
    <p><p>This whole response and cultural reaction is so full of hubris. The arrogance required to reject the natural cycles of life and death and try to "eradicate" our only remaining natural predator, illness, honestly disgusts me.</p>
<p>We have an over-population problem, so isn't something that kills under one percent of the population, mostly targeting the sick and old actually beneficial? I hate to sound cold or excessively darwinian, but honestly, it's what I think. This disease is a good thing and we should be welcoming it. Those whose immune systems are strong will live and reproduce, those whose are not, will not.</p>
<p>We will decrease our population problem as well as create a naturally-selected stronger humanity.</p></p>

        <p>Just being completely hypothetical because it's an interesting topic, what if most people were already infected by some plague and a side effect is irrational hypochondria. Viruses can do all sorts of weird things. Iirc toxoplasmosis from cat feces makes people like cats more. </p>
<p>When I was in school I did an assignment on a science news article. I found an article that was about a study where they were swabbing people's mouths looking for something and they accidentally discovered that over half the study subjects were infected with an unknown virus that impacted motor skills and thinking. It was a pretty well reviewed and robust study. I'm not sure if I can find it again though. </p>
<p>Scientists know almost nothing about the world and even less about the human body. They are also really bad at interdisciplinary work since studies usually only focus on one question and aren't looked at or maybe even useful to people outside the field.</p>
<p>A few hundred years ago we didn't even know cells and atoms existed. Imagine what we could discover in another thousand. I suspect the reality of our universe is more strange than we could ever imagine. I mean think about archaea, an invisible order of life that exists literally everywhere but no one knows really what they do. Most people probably don't even know archaea exist in the world not to mention inside every person's mouth and butthole.</p>

        <p>Another thought for you about viruses -- what if they are a byproduct of other diseases going on in the body, and terrain theory is the correct hypothesis, not germ theory? </p>
<p>This is put forward in the book "Virus Mania" from 2009, quite the eye-opener, if only to get one thinking. ;)</p>

        <p>Yes they are. Viral infections such as cold and flu viruses trigger fevers which destroy potential tumors and also cause mucus production which expels bad, potentially cancerous cells out of your body. 
It's a purge of sorts which is good for your body and serves a purpose. Everything has a purpose in nature.</p>

        <p>Check out this article: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1313773/Can-fever-cure-cancer-Jordan-baffled-doctors-leukaemia-vanished-new-evidence-suggests-remarkable-explanation-.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1313773/Can-fever-cure-cancer-Jordan-baffled-doctors-leukaemia-vanished-new-evidence-suggests-remarkable-explanation-.html</a></p>
<p>Several reports, including a recent paper in the Netherlands Journal Of Medicine, have linked a significant number of spontaneous disappearances of leukaemia to fever caused by serious infections.</p>
<p>Now, scientists believe they understand how this might work. There are two theories: the first is that an infection serious enough to provoke a fever response can push the body's immune system into a high-powered, hypersensitive state.</p>
<p>This helps the patient's immune system detect the fact that cancer cells are subtly different from normal healthy cells. It then attacks the tumour cells as though they are infectious invaders.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/surgery/hyperthermia-fact-sheet">https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/surgery/hyperthermia-fact-sheet</a> Hyperthermia (also called thermal therapy or thermotherapy) is a type of cancer treatment in which body tissue is exposed to high temperatures (up to 113°F). Research has shown that high temperatures can damage and kill cancer cells, usually with minimal injury to normal tissues (1). By killing cancer cells and damaging proteins and structures within cells (2), hyperthermia may shrink tumors.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the links. That’s an interesting read. It seems it’s not a panacea but another tool with (at the moment) varied results. Good stuff.</p>
<p>I especially like the fever theory, we already know that fevers are an effective immune response, so this resonates.</p>

        <p>I tend to see it as just a fact of life that we need to adapt to. It's ironic to me that over at r/collapse, a sub that pre-COVID had a good number of people saying that the world is overpopulated and needed disasters to control the human population, most ended up flipping to lamenting that not enough is being done to control the virus. The common thread is self-righteousness, the vibe over there is that we're doomed because people like them aren't making the rules for everyone else to live by.</p>

        <p>Yes. Immunological adaptation and evolution necessitates constant communal and environmental exposure to each other's "coodies".</p>
<p>"Only the strongest survive" is natures well designed process for ensuring the evolutionary genetic strengthening of all biological species. Illness is a necessary and natural process for eliminating the genetic vulnerabilities in the immunologically weak and elderly. Big Pharma and it's germ-theory based vaccine pseudoscience are trying to disrupt this natural process among humans by genetically weakening the entire population with immunologically damaging toxic cocktails that cause an endless list of developmental and chronic disorders. It's no coincidence that the epidemic of exploding cancer rates directly mirror the significant increases in vaccination rates multiplied by the  ever growing list of vaccines to what are now very low risk diseases due to advancements in sanitation systems, hygienic care, and most importantly, access to better nutritional foods and overall dietary health.</p>
