    <strong>What's going to happen when the unemployment benefits end and rent moratoriums?</strong>
    <p><p>There's no jobs out there. A few low wage fast food is available. But family supporting jobs, forget it, at least around here. Unemployment here ends in the Sept. I just read an article millions have not made their rent for more than a year, So what happens when all the moratoriums stop? I keep thinking they have to be collapsing the system or have nefarious purposes behind the shots, because I don't see how this isn't going to end badly.</p></p>

        <p>Literally everyone around me is hiring! My husband owns a lawn care company and he can’t find employees. Everywhere has hiring bonuses and now hiring signs…. There are jobs… people are just not working because the government is paying them not to.</p>

        <p>Are you kidding?  There are a ton of jobs out there.  Employers all over the country are hurting because they can't find enough people who would rather work for a living than suckle off the government.  ALL benefits should've ended months ago.</p>

        <p>One-third of our businesses here closed [this number was reported]and went bankrupt since Covid, I live in a smaller town. We see closed up and boarded businesses everywhere and this is not due to lack of employees, they are GONE. Seriously this does not apply everywhere. I am disabled so not searching. I know Florida and some Southern states may be doing a LOT better, but NOT here.</p>

        <p>So... you're on disability, then?  That's not unemployment.  That's an entirely different thing.  You might want to say that in your op.  If you're on disability, why are you worried about unemployment ending?  That doesn't affect you.</p>

        <p>Both.  Both are available.  Most of the minimum wagers should be high schoolers.  But there's plenty of $15/hour jobs available right now.  They are advertised all over the place.  And there's a lot of $40k &amp; $50k jobs available, too. My firm is in desperate need of project managers at $65k.  The construction industry has exploded.  But it's in real trouble because there's not enough people to work the jobs that support it.  My firm's controlling partner had to actually send out an email this past Friday to everyone in the firm essentially begging us all to try and find someone who can come work for us because we have so much work to do.</p>

        <p>i have been worried about this for many months now. i had a lot of people around me saying all the "saving lives is more important than the economy" and "let capitalism burn" stuff. i had to ask them how they imagine women and children fare in failed economies, how the disabled and infirm fare in failed economies...</p>
<p>anyway the number of homeless in my area exploded around last june and it's only been increasing since then. i dread the winter for them.</p>

        <p>Me too. The poverty here is getting scary, I am seeing endless people in streets walking with bags and carts and holding cardboard signs, our inner city area looks even more depressed. We literally have boarded up businesses everywhere, there is a richer section of town but even a lot of those have closed. Yeah none of them care how people fare in economies. I can see even disability crashing and burning seriously. The numbers of homeless are exploding here. Also noticing a lot of people disappearing from groups and whatnot, new poverty and pressures of life? I can tell with a couple groups a LOT of people are moving..</p>

        <p>every single person i know has fled my city and i will be leaving shortly myself. with the increase in poverty there's been an increase in crime, i also live in a rich area and the entire neighborhood around my apartment building is full of "for sale" signs. the wealthy are leaving with their tax dollars and everything will just get worse. it's pretty rapidly turning into a shithole.</p>
<p>when we had enhanced unemployment the bars in the area changed as well, new ones took the foreclosed spaces, attracting people who have no jobs and all this new money, so they're here getting drunk every night and end up shooting each other. there have been shootings in my neighborhood every week since april i'm pretty sure. 🤦‍♀️ none before that.</p>

        <p>The reason for all of this trickery on the part of the elites—and yes, this includes creating the conditions causing the unemployment crisis—is <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">the Great Reset</a>. Broadly speaking, the Great Reset is a plan involving remaking the world’s economic and political systems on the basis that what we have now doesn’t work. There are many components of the Great Reset, lbut the core theme of it is sustainability in the form of “carbon neutrality,” as they put it.</p>
<p>That sounds good on the surface, even if they are taking advantage of the pandemic as <a href="https://www.weforum.org/focus/the-great-reset">“a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world.”</a> As the saying goes, though, the devil is in the details—besides <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles">phasing out fossil fuels</a>, they will be <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9501565/How-Bidens-climate-plan-affect-everyday-Americans.html">cutting red meat consumption to just 4lbs per year (a 90% reduction)</a>, forcing people to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2021/04/04/home-radiators-will-have-ten-degrees-cooler-britain-reach-net/">turn their heaters 10 degrees Celsius cooler</a>, <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/299414/REP_Absolute_Zero_V3_20200505.pdf?sequence=9&amp;isAllowed=y">stopping shipping and air travel completely</a>, and many other things besides. Most ominous is the WEF’s vision for 2030, which involves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBBxWtKKQiA">people “owning nothing” yet being “happy.”</a></p>
<p>The first of two major methods they are using to begin is process is COVID vaccination, which they are using to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/05/15/vaccine-passports-covid-19-vaccine-verification-coming/7130642002/">introduce vaccine passports</a>, the first of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/nyregion/excelsior-pass-vaccine.html">having already been rolled out in New York (the Excelsior pass)</a>, to which it is conspicuously easy to attach a digital wallet. And this will likely be the next step, given the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/benefits-cashless-society-mobile-payments/">WEF’s open support of a cashless society.</a> It does not really need spelling out (but I will do so anyway) that the reason for this is to remove physical money from the equation in order to establish control; it is all well and good if you have money, but if you can’t use it because it’s all in the cloud and you’ve engaged in too many “dissident” activities,  then it doesn’t matter if you’re a broke college student or a multimillionaire—you’re still not going to be able to feed yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/">The prevailing theory regarding taking away everyone’s property and possessions (or their ownership of them, at first) is that there will be a debt forgiveness program</a> (note: while I don’t know how true it is that that link is an actual leak, I am providing it because it makes logical sense, and shows I am not just making up my own theories on this). Once the economy has crashes, the government will say something like “we know the economy is terrible and you don’t have a job, the money to pay your debts, or the means to put food on the table; but if you join our debt forgiveness program, it’ll all go away, and you’ll receive a UBI payment, too.” But in order to join the program, you’ll have to be vaccinated and give up ownership of all your possessions. This would include money (after all, money is used to buy possessions).</p>
<p>The second way is through the budding cyber pandemic, which <a href="https://youtu.be/0DKRvS-C04o">Klaus Schwab himself said will make COVID look like a minor inconvenience, and will involve a grid-down scenario.</a> Indeed, there have already been <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-fireeye-breached-after-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/">attacks on SolarWinds and FireEye</a>. Most troublingly, FireEye’s offensive toolkit, one of the best in the world and normally used to test defensive software for large corporations and the government, was stolen in the hack. This was preceded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210531124228/https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/02/investigative-reports/from-event-201-to-cyber-polygon-the-wefs-simulation-of-a-coming-cyber-pandemic/">Cyber Polygon 2020, which conspicuously was planning for that exact type of hack, reminiscent of how Event 201 preceded the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic by just a few weeks</a>, and will shortly be followed by <a href="https://cyberpolygon.com">Cyber Polygon 2021 on July 9th</a>.</p>
<p>They will use this second line of offense to justify the creation of a new system, since the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, along with the shipping container and crop shortages (and other artificial agricultural vulnerabilities), will trigger a depression worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s and prove to the people that the current system doesn’t work.</p>
<p>That said, this isn’t even half of what is going on here, so I highly encourage you to look into it yourself.</p>

        <p>Huge companies like Blackrock are buying up all of the houses. It's a sellers market and no one will be able to out compete these companies for real estate. Rentals are already full and new leases are more expensive than they were last year that's for sure. </p>
<p>People are refusing to work and this supplemental stuff will come to an end. I see a lot of homelessness and many unprepared, confused people wandering around wondering why the government doesn't care about them anymore.</p>

        <p>Then you need to move to where the jobs are.  You don't get to just live wherever you want and expect the taxpayers to fund the lifestyle you want.  If you can't find a job that you're qualified for where you're at, then move to a city where you can find work.  EVERY US city right now has plenty of jobs!</p>

        <p>I've moved multiple times, in my life for the sake of finding work--predisability. It's weird you all are saying there's plenty of jobs, maybe there are astroturfers, didn't you have businesses close from this bullshit where you live? [yeah astroturfer -13 karma score]</p>
