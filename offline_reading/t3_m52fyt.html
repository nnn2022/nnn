    <strong>If you own a business and shut it down during the scamdemic I have some news for you...</strong>
    <p><p>You don’t actually own your business, the government does. You might have the keys, but daddy government tells you when you are allowed to use those keys. Daddy tells you when you can be open, how many people can be in your business and what they have to wear in your business.</p>
<p>Most of the businesses that were deemed non essential in Canada took government subsidies during 2020, what did you think you were exchanging for that subsidy ? </p>
<p>I can’t imagine ever starting my own business in the future simply because of this fact. You don’t own your business. Hell, most people don’t own their own bodies anymore, they would cover their own airways and inject themselves with who knows what to avoid having to deal with clear government overreach. </p>
<p>I saw some tattoo shops and bars go underground in the beginning but even then, once they were found out, they rolled over because of the illegitimate fines that were being handed out that will be thrown out for those who fight them, just watch. </p>
<p>Business owners who think they own their businesses and people who think they own their own bodies, look in the mirror, that’s a cuck you see in the reflection. That’s what defeat looks like and most of you didn’t even put up a fight. Pathetic.</p>
<p>Edit: I will add that protests don’t have to be large demonstrations in front of a government building. When the mask mandate was put into place, I refused. I was told I’d be fired if I didn’t by both a government agent and the owner. I still refused, I was not fired, they removed me from the schedule however but I wasn’t fired. One other employee followed my lead, the rest wore masks until the place was shut down entirely. If you give an inch, you will lose a mile.</p></p>

        <p>This was all by design of course.</p>
<p>For example in Canada, small businesses were offered a $40,000 loan of which only $30,000 was repayable by December 2022.</p>
<p>The Communist Intelligentsia which makes up the majority of Canadians in our helplessly cucked nation hailed this as "revolutionary" and a sign of our "excellent government response" (I personally just puked in my mouth for writing that).</p>
<p><strong>They break your legs, then hand you a crutch.</strong></p>
<p>I have my own small business, and was essentially forced to take this loan.  Free 10K right?  Can't be that bad.  Right?</p>
<p>Except my business still goes down to zero and I have to close it (tourism based business).  </p>
<p>So now I have this 30K loan I will need to pay back in the next two years.  This is without a job, without a business, without an industry in which to work.</p>
<p>There's basically no way I'll ever be able to pay that back.  Certainly not if I'm not able to run my business.</p>
<p>It's like extortion.  Make them an offer they (literally) can't refuse.  Promise them it will only be a few weeks of closures.  Offer them light at the end of tunnel with shiny government language like "we've got your back" and other such platitudes.</p>
<p>Now check this out.  <strong>These loans were all given out by the banks, backed by the government.</strong></p>
<p>When these loans fail, and it's easy to imagine an enormous number of these loans will fail spectacularly, who's going to be left holding the bag?</p>
<p>Not the banks, you can rest assured of that.  It will be Government.  The tax payer on the hook.</p>
<p>It's frankly corrupt, criminal activity.</p>

        <p>Since you seem to be fascinated about others fucking your wife, (Which is what "cucked" means) all you are doing by saying taxes have a 'utility' is haggling about how deep your wife gets fucked by other guys. IMO, once the head is in, might as well take the shaft. </p>
<p>You could have just stopped with "if you think you own".... You don't own.</p>

        <p>I could have stopped anywhere lol much more effective to draw parallels between an outside man coming to fuck your wife and the government coming to fuck your business. </p>
<p>I’m not married so I’m not a cuck, but had I worn a mask, ever, even once, I would draw parallels between me and a literal cuck, like I do with everyone who wears a mask. </p>
<p>If you took the scamdemic seriously, or if it was an actual pandemic, you wouldn’t even open your business, you also would not wear the same mask your dentist wears to prevent splash, you would wear a hazmat suit or you wouldn’t leave your house. </p>
<p>So I draw parallels, if I offended you, cuck, I’m not sorry.</p>

        <p>I own a business that was affected  by this. I am grateful I got my money back with PPP and other subsidies. My business pays taxes, I should have support. </p>
<p>Sorry to hear your employers were being difficult. Probably had something to do with getting money. But also not firing you so they could count you as an employee on PPP application. I don’t know... but I’m guessing if you dig down enough, it’s money. Sorry to hear you got the short end of the stick. </p>
