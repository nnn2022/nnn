    <strong>My idiot of a mother let our bird die because going to the vets is not essential in lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>I hate my mother and am considering reporting her for animal cruelty. </p>
<p>Our bird a kakariki got egg bound the other day and the egg was too high up to be removed with home treatment. </p>
<p>I suggested we had to take her to the vets or she would die as this is an emergency but my mother repeatedly said nothing other than ‘we are in a lockdown. We can’t go to the vets. It’s not an essential reason to leave our home. We have to stay home protect the nhs and save lives’. </p>
<p>The nearest avian vet is 20 miles away and when I went to book a taxi to take the bird myself my mother threatened to report me to the police for leaving home without an essential reason during lockdown- I said treating the bird was an essential reason but she just repeated “there’s a serious pandemic. 50000 people have died of covid here. We have to stay home protect the nhs and save lives. We are in lockdown!’ </p>
<p>The bird died an hour ago. </p>
<p>I’m actually thinking of reporting my mother to the RSPCA for animal cruelty- I absolutely hate her. Since covid she’s become incapable of doing anything other than mindlessly repeating mantras from the govt and regularly reports people to the police who she sees walking down the street with one other person. </p>
<p>As you can probably guess she’s incredibly uneducated- she has no education past school and is on minimum wage. I despise her. What she died our bird just because of lockdown shows what a disgusting human being she is.</p>
<p>Edit: people are saying I should have got in the taxi anyway; my mother turned the taxi away and was ranting h about police- do you think a taxi driver would take a teenager as authority or the mother when it comes to picking the teen up and driving said teen to the nearest avian vet? It goes without saying the taxi driver drove off and left my Karen mother ranting and raging. </p>
<p>I actually regret not phoning the police on myself so they could explain that I’m doing nothing wrong to my mother but she would still consider it illegal; we are in Surrey the nearest vet is Berkshire who does exotic birds so she would have sperged out that while Surrey police accept it maybe Berkshire police would arrest her or whatever (and honestly in fairness to her Surrey police is a lot more laid back than our neighbouring counties with enforcing lockdown so taking Surrey police’s acceptance that it’s not a lockdown breach wouldn’t help when Berkshire and Thames valley are almost as bad as Derbyshire with persecuting people over lockdown).</p>
<p>And a friend who could drive? I mean mate this is the UK driving lessons in south east England are like £50 a go if you go with a decent driving school (rather than Bob or Gillian the solo driving instructor who’s students are crap at their driving tests). Most people in Britain (and indeed most of Europe and other expensive countries like those in east asia) don’t learn to drive until their mid 20s and the few teenagers who have licenses usually don’t have their own cars. I know about one guy under 23 who has a driving licence AND his own car. It’s also prohibitively expensive to insure a driver under 25 so even if I could fork out £150 a week (3 lessons with a decent driving instructor) for however long putting me on my mother’s car would be another few thousand and getting my own car and insuring that would be even worse. And that’s how it is for all my friends too so the 5 with driving licences have no access to a car. 
Driving lessons in lockdown were also impossible so it’s a miracle anyone between 17 and 19 has a driving licence.</p></p>

        <p>Sorry about your loss but, taking a pet to the vet is an essential reason to leave the house. Yeah your mother was being a complete idiot but you could have just taken the taxi to the vet anyway... I doubt the cops would take the time to hunt down a taxi for someone taking a pet in for medical treatment...</p>

        <p>I apologize if I'm a bit nieve about the situation, I'm not saying your mom was in the right by any means... no point in dwelling about what you could have or should have done anyway.. The next time you are put in a situation like that just try calling the cops.. pretty sure taking a pet to the vet is essential so cops would have likely sided with you and let you leave.</p>

        <p>I'm disgusted for you.  I am. And I'm not going to sit here and ask you to forgive her because she's your Mom. This is some shit my Mom would do and did plenty of times. I've mostly blocked it from my memory. I left in high school and have very, very little to do with her. She's insufferable and I don't owe her shit. </p>
<p>Good luck processing your anger and deciding what to do now and in the future.</p>

        <p>That is horrible. I just looked at a list of the rules for leaving. This does fall under legit reasons. Both essential activity and animal welfare reasons. Possibly even medical care if the category includes animals</p>

        <p>Check out r/raisedbynarcissists. But I wouldn’t necessarily share your story because most of Reddit is extremely pro lockdown. However, it might be helpful to read other people’s stories- it sounds like your mom could have a personality disorder. And I’m sorry about your bird 💗</p>

        <p>The bird's death is lamentable, but the elephant in the room is that you hate your mother.  This could be because she's a narcissist, or even because you are.  </p>
<p>I'd recommend serious research into family therapy.  Get whatever space you can away from each other, before this explodes into violence or addiction.</p>

        <p>I would absolutely report her for animal cruelty. Animal abuse can and does often eventually turn into domestic violence. Sounds like she could use a reminder that laws still exist outside of "what will spread COVID or not."</p>

        <p>As a bird owner myself, I really wish you had ignored her and taken the bird anyway. But since you're a teenager, I totally get why you didn't have a ton of options because you're not the "adult power" in the situation. Really, really sorry about the bird. The good news is, you won't be a teen living with her forever. Eventually you will be an adult and have more freedom.</p>
<p>If there's more abuse that this going on, seek out help from other adults. If it's just her being hysterical and brainwashed and it's not typical behavior, you'll have to live with the fact that parents are human beings too and sometimes make really, really terrible mistakes, even when they continue to believe it was not a mistake.</p>

You can’t help it if your mother is being that unreasonable. Again, I’m very sorry for your loss, it’s extremely upsetting to lose a pet and my heart goes out to you.</p>

        <p>I can understand why you're annoyed. I would be devastated if anything happened to harm my dog, in fact, it wouldn't happen because I just simply would have got in the taxi and fucked the consequences. But you may be quite a bit younger than me.</p>
<p>However, your mother is not a bad person, she's just been conditioned by decades of propaganda. My own family are clueless. They're as helpless as your bird. It's not productive to feel hate towards your mother.</p>

        <p>My heart is breaking. If I lost my bird I’d be a wreck so I can only imagine what you’re feeling. </p>
<p>But Please dont direct your anger at your mother. It’s the media and elites that did this to her. You’re rightfully upset but I don’t see how reporting her would solve anything.</p>

        <p>Agreed, this was wrong. If you have the balls to report your own mom for a crime, she certainly committed a crime here.</p>

        <p>Yeah it’s horrible. But if you really want to make that rift between you two, just be aware of the possible consequences. There’s also no telling if anything will actually happen if you report it. Not sure where you are but the state could side with your mom. </p>
<p>Why didn’t you end up getting the taxi? Or find a friend that could drive? If you really didn’t care if she called the police...</p>

        <p>She turned the taxi away</p>
<p>And a friend who could drive? I mean mate this is the UK driving lessons in south east England are like £50 a go if you go with a decent driving school (rather than Bob or Gillian the solo driving instructor who’s students are crap at their driving tests). Most people in Britain don’t learn to drive until their mid 20s and the few teenagers who have licenses usually don’t have their own cars. I know about one guy under 23 who has a driving licence AND his own car.</p>
