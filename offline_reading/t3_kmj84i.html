    <strong>On today's propaganda agenda: online school!</strong>
    <p><p>Let's choose 4 local well-off families and interview their kids to parrot off how much "fun" (their words) online school is and how much more they enjoy sitting in front of a screen instead of playing with their friends in person. The first part of the interview sounded very scripted with the same terms we keep hearing (i.e. zoom play dates and such).</p>
<p>The conclusion, however, was glorious: the reporter asked the 8 kids who would want to do this forever, and their faces dropped and not a single hand shot up with enthusiasm like they did at the beginning of the interview. That last part was met with the generic "but we have to do this to stay safe" lecture by the reporter but those kids just stayed deflated until the end of the report. Kids are good at word vomiting scripts when told, but they're also good at showing their true colors. And, of course, zero mention of poor families who have been robbed of an education period, and even of proper meals in many cases.</p>
<p>Edited to add: I don't find it glorious that these children are very obviously deprived of a normal education and overall childhood, but the fact that the news couldn't hide their faces was refreshing to see.</p></p>

        <p>Excellent! I love my fellow humans so much that we must keep up this charade and ignore the actual tragic effects of lockdowns themselves.</p>
