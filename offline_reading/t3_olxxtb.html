    <p><p>like, instead of talking so much about how much this sucks, talk about how to fix this dystopia we are in. yeah, I'm all for exposing shit, but not telling about more positive things (like others resisting, willingly vaxed people refusing to wear masks, stuff like that) is fear mongering, and is most likely taking a toll on our mental health.</p></p>

        <p>We have already said again and again that there is only one way that this bullshit can be fixed. All of the brainwashed morons have to take their face diapers off and stop "obeying the new rules". You, and everyone else here knows, this is not going to ever happen. The average person is fuckin dense, and is mind fucked by the TV. We are in this endless tyranny because of the stupid sheep complying. It is as simple as that.</p>

        <p>Agree. It‚Äôs been said here MANY TIMES. There is no other way to stop this. People need to stop acquiescing. Governments aren‚Äôt just going to say hey guys it‚Äôs over ! That will never happen. People need to stop going along with this bullshit.  That is how to ‚Äúfix‚Äù this. </p>
<p>Also , I have to fucking hold all of this in to get through the day where I live.  I feel trapped and demoralized and connecting with others who are having a similar experience is helpful in keeping my sanity.</p>

        <p>And now they've have committed, literally, their lives to the state. Most people I know that will not take it are mostly the independent type and don't consume the cheese in the governments mousetrap. Even then, it is such a shift in one's reality to accept the truth that not only is the mouse trap going to maim or kill yourself or a loved one, but the government put rotten cheese and in the trap and manipulated other mice into telling you to take the cheese. All whilst hiding scars on their backs... </p>
<p>We think we have let the multi-media/entertainment industry rule in lieu government but they are one and the same.</p>
<p>We are all guilty of holding onto a part of this flawed system that gives us a form of comfort, we're on reddit after all. Hell, I went through a rough couple of years trying to accept it, but I'm at peace with however things turn out because of the spiritual growth that occurred through that process</p>

        <p>I fully agree with you. They never have nor  experienced real trauma, for if they did, more sheep would be awake and fighting against this corrupt nonsense.  Wish I was able to live such a sheltered life as they have.  Fuck me and the dirty shit I‚Äôve been subjected to against my own being.
