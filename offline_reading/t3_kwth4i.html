    <strong>2019: Loneliness Epidemic; 2020-21 Socialising = Being Selfish &amp; it's a crime</strong>
    <p><p>I mean, before all this crap people were spending more and more time on their screens (I'm guilty as charged, I'll admit), loneliness was called an epidemic, young folks had significantly less friends than previous generations, and what is the "Public Health" thing to do?</p>
<p>Lockdown, cut social ties, destroy communities, force people who are not at risk of dying from THE DISEASE OF THE CENTURY to stay home. I'm sick of BS like <em>thank you for socialising less</em> and <em>this year, wave instead of hugging</em>. This. Is. Absurd. And what about stuff like support groups? AA, NA, etc. It's just irresponsible to do this. Big kudos to the Great Barrington folks, they're brave in a time when it's encouraged to be silent.</p></p>

        <p>Not that they care about yours. If you say you don't support lockdowns they happily tell you "I hope you die of covid". So why should I give a fuck about these people? Should I kill my life and dreams to protect people who wish I was put in an internment camp?</p>

        <p>Thanks for the question. Efficient use of limited resources, by offering protection to those at-risk (65+, people with chronic issues) and priority vaccination. Those not at-risk may choose to carry on as normal, as the collateral damage of protecting themselves far outweights the advantages of shielding against a disease that statistically is not relevant to them, death-wise.</p>
<p>Basically, doing what Humanity has done pre-COVID, but better, by protecting even more efficently those at-risk.</p>

        <p>With Focused Protection, which is what I described, there's no problem to carry on as normal. It should actually be encouraged, because panic ain't good in a pandemic. They shouldn't lose friends, that's terrible and unnecessary.</p>

        <p>I'm so tired of people who are not afraid of this virus being called selfish or greedy. You know what's greedy? Forcing the majority of the population into isolation in order to protect the minority. It's selfish that protecting your 93 your old grandmother, who is likely going to die within the next year regardless, is more important than the millions of children out there that are being deprived of an entire year of their childhood. Or the millions of people whose mental health is suffering far more than any amount of suffering this virus would cause them if they were to catch it. </p>
<p>Those that are elderly or vulnerable to COVID should absolutely take precautions and be staying home. As long as they are protected, there shouldn't be an issue with overloading the hospitals. And those who are afraid they'll be one of the less than 5% of otherwise healthy people that end up seriously ill from Covid should also have the choice to stay home if that's what they feel is best for them. Those of us that are not afraid of this virus should be allowed to make our own choices regarding our own health and live a normal life if that's the risk we're willing to accept. </p>
<p>All I know is that even if I did end up being one of the unlucky ones the ends up seriously ill and dying from Covid, I sure as hell would have wished that I'd spent the last year of my life actually LIVING and being with the people I love rather than this bullshit shell of a llife we've been forced into for the past year.</p>

        <p>Which is why the elderly should be isolated from all those awful greedy people that believe life is about more than simply existing and breathing.</p>
<p>Or should we just continue to take away years of everyone else's lives, destroy their livelihoods, shut down their family businesses, essentially destroying their futures so that we may extend the lives of all that have already lived long and full lives by another 6 months or so?</p>

        <p>I've stopped listening to anyone who equates wanting to live a normal life with selfish.   Those people are either not even practicing what they preach, (several friends scream online about people being out but then they go on vacation, out to eat, etc), are shut ins anyway so haven't had to sacrifice anything or change their lives at all, or are simply scared for themselves and hide behind the moral superiority of "staying home to protect others.  The last group is becoming more transparent as they openly complain about how they should be vaccinated before the elderly/high risk. (You know, the people they claimed to be protecting this whole time.)</p>

        <p>It's an old problem: it doesn't happen in my backyard, it doesn't matter.
My mom just can't understand what it feels like to socialize so little as I do probably because she's very work-oriented and didn't hang out regularly with friends. So it doesn't affect her...</p>
<p>This is about empathy/compassion. I know how much I've suffered this past year, but I also care a lot about all the other people. Figures like 130 million excess people at risk of starvation worldwide or 1 in 4 US young adults considering suicide in June 2020 absolutely appall me.</p>
