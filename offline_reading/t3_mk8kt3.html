    <strong>My coworker had Covid, and was the biggest drama queen about it.</strong>
    <p><p>Like the title says, my coworker had Covid fairly recently, and his recounting of it just tells me the guy has apparently never been sick before.
He talks about how his chest hurt so bad, how all he ever wanted to do was sleep, and couldn’t stop coughing.</p>
<p>As someone who grew up getting bronchitis once or twice every single year for the better part of 15 years, everything he has described sounds pretty much identical to every bout of bronchitis I’ve ever had. Actually, it sounds milder, since he said his was a dry cough, whereas my bronchitis cough included phlegm, which would regularly get caught in my throat and make me shoot up in bed feeling like I was drowning. But I digress.</p>
<p>Here’s why I’m here to rant. I’ve overheard this guy telling others about his experience, and saying bullshit like “yeah, experiencing something like that, it just really makes you think. It’s very sobering.”
The dude wasn’t even hospitalized. He had a crummy respiratory illness for a couple weeks, and is acting like he had a near death experience.</p>
<p>He also keeps acting like everything is a long term Covid symptom. Was acting like he has brain fog because of the supposed lack of oxygen in the brain during Covid. Then went on to tell me about how he worked 40 hours at his side job over the weekend.
So apparently sleep deprivation is long term Covid.</p></p>

        <p>They always do this. Everyone I know whose caught COVID really plays it up, yet what they describe always sounds like your run-of-the-mill flu or cold.</p>

        <p>People who have never experienced a bad case of the flu don't know how bad that shit can fuck you up. It's a week of abject misery, followed by another two weeks of gradual recovery.</p>

        <p>Yup, there are definitely a lot of people who have never experienced significant illness before.
My bronchitis could last up to a month or more. At the very least the cough would hang on for close to two months. A couple times it almost went into pneumonia, or maybe it even did, and I wanted to die.
But I guess if someone’s never experienced that before, then a nasty cold for two weeks must feel like the end.</p>
