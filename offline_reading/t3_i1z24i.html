    <strong>Is it a violation of medical privacy for 3rd parties to require access to COVID test results?</strong>
    <p><p>Throwaway because I'm posting a document from my university. In order to register for fall semester classes, my university is requiring students to be tested for COVID at the start of the semester, as well as randomly throughout the duration of the semester. They are requiring this for all students who live in the same county as the university, even for students who are taking online classes only, and even for graduate and professional students who are already permanent residents of the county and have never left. </p>
<p>I am concerned about the "Release of Information" section, as it seems to be consenting to waiving my HIPAA rights. If I sign this, I'm consenting to the university receiving the results of all of my COVID tests at the same time that I do, right? I'm not alright with my university having immediate access to my personal medical test results, especially when I know they'll be using them for contact tracing measures and hence not keeping them private. This seems fishy to me and I haven't signed it yet. Here is the release form at the end of the website where you have to sign up for testing (with names redacted) - what do you all think? Is this reasonable or ethical? What should I do?: </p>

        <p>You <em>might</em> be able to post in r/legaladvice they may be able to help you better.. I'm not sure how it would go down over there though... if you do that let us know the result though.. I am looking at something similar with my job</p>

        <p>Yeah, it looks like I'll need to ask a lawyer about it. I've heard that a lot of universities and companies are trying to do these mandatory testing programs, and it really makes me uncomfortable, especially after reading the fine print. Seems like a slippery slope to start allowing businesses and employers to have access to medical test results. If I find out anything about the legality of this, I'll let you know!</p>

        <p>I understand, I have a problem with mandatory masks too (I guess most of us on this sub probably do!). I don't necessarily mind getting tested before going back to campus, but I do mind my private medical data being shared with anyone other than my doctor. Hopefully this release form isn't as sinister as it looks.</p>

        <p>It seems like it's saying that the organization you listed will just get the results of your covid test which is no different than basically a note from your doctor saying whether it was positive or negative.</p>
<p>No offence, but if you are being tested through work and this is what they asked for, that seems entirely reasonable and ethical to me...</p>

        <p>I read it and the only thing it authorizes release of is the COVID-19 test results. You can revoke it at any time but once it is to the organization requesting it, itâ€™s theirs to use. Whether or not this can be required is another question entirely. Certain types of health examinations can be required for work or school I believe but I am not sure about the legal issues here.</p>

        <p>Health privacy laws went right out the window. We are in a post-law society where laws are selectively enforced based on the immediate situation, if somebody is scared and feelings are involved, or what side of the aisle you're on.</p>
