    <strong>My mom is the only one believing this shit</strong>
    <p><p>My whole family thinks it's bullshit and won't take the vaccine but my mom already took it, felt like shit for 2 days after her shots, and is now trying to convince everyone to take it.</p>
<p>My dad is a medical assistant who is in effect a family doctor over here, he won't take it because of allergies and he doesn't trust it because it was developed way to fast.</p>
<p>My aunt had covid and and while she had it my mom was fearmongering everywhere saying that she almost and died and shit and when I spoke with my aunt now she's made fun of her and is anti-covid shot, saying that it was only a bad flu.</p>
<p>My cousin is also against the new normal and we spoke about it at the Easter dinner, she, her husband and two kids won't get the shot for the same reason, because it's long term consequences haven't been researched.</p>
<p>When she brings up the subject and everyone disproves her with millions of articles and everything - she just says okay and tries to change the subject or she just says "you won't ever convince me".</p></p>

        <p>It's funny...nobody who doesn't want the vaccine is telling others not to get it but most people who do have it are telling others they have to or should get it.</p>
