        <p>Trust me I am not a doomer or pro lockdown, but COVID does actually cause blood clots. While its unfortunate this lady died and others will of similar COVID complications I dont believe the whole world should pay.  it I'm only saying this because I think to make a persuasive case we need to be aware of our own mis-information.</p>

        <p>Oh no lol I DO NOT believe in masks. I had COVID (super mild not even a cold) and probably got it from wearing the same mask to work, fumbling with it, taking change fumbling with it again etc. I am also super super AGAINST lockdowns. I have seen first hand, how they are far more destructive than this virus. My JOKE of a university decided to close campus and the library unless you have a booking, which is harder to get than a Coachella ticket at the detriment to students who have to share rooms with like 5 siblings, or live with an abuser, or simply need the library resources. I know this example doesn't even scratch the surface of how badly people have been impacted by the lockdowns. It's a virus, its nature, it can't be controlled and unfortunately people will die, but people will also die crossing roads or getting the flu, we just can't ruin people's chances at living because of this. My point is yes COVID kills, mostly people on their death beds but with every virus or illness there will be a few tragic deaths, this does not mean that for every fluke 30 year old that dies we can ruin the livelihoods of 100 (some people will never financially recover from this and students graduating into a recession always make less than their peers). All I meant by my above comment was that to make an effective argument we need to make sure we have the facts. One wrong statement on our side destroys our chances at ever being listened to.</p>

        <p>I mean... it's sad.  But there's a reason why pregnancies over 35 are "high risk". Unless she has a kid every year since she turned 18.</p>
<p>But that's not the point. The point is A: people have a hyperactive empathy response because most of them haven't seen true suffering in generations. B: the media and governments have no problem manipulating society and exploiting point A.</p>

        <p>It's not super common in modern times outside of certian religious groups, but not too strange even just over recent history. The modern method of having just one and then devoting all your time and energy to consumer culture is a much weirder way to live.</p>

        <p>Yeah I'll say you are the odd one, especially in this sub, which is usually filled with non judgemental people, ironically it has been judgemental people that has led to this sub being created in the first place. If you'd like to chat in the private chat on reddit, I'll gladly tell you all about the 8 children I've had (no twins) while I'm 33 years old and am killing myself to make sure my children are raised to respect others (a lesson you seem to have missed. Was this because you had 7 siblings?) while my criminally abusive parents get your tick of approval because they had the socially acceptable pigeon pair two kid family. Grow up and stop judging.</p>

        <p>What if she had 20 kids? One every year of her life since 16. Thereâ€™s a limit to how many children you can financially support. Iâ€™m with OP. In a world where we have limited resources, this is pretty selfish behavior. </p>
<p>This kind of made sense back 100-200 years ago when you lived on a self-sustaining farm and half your kids would have died from some disease. In the modern world, having this many kids is just selfish. </p>
<p>If you have the time and energy to raise that many kids, you should adopt!</p>

        <p>I agree somewhat. But with all due respect, turning this into a debate on how many children one should have isnâ€™t really the point of this sub. Itâ€™s unrelated to covid for the most part. Personally, I love kids, but I donâ€™t want any of my own and I have been judged for that too so I try not to be a hypocrite.</p>

        <p>My only point is that at some point you have to admit the number of kids some people are having is absurd. </p>
<p>I grew up in a family of 4 kids and my parents were absolutely at their limit. The younger siblings didnâ€™t get near the amount of attention as the oldest 2. Maybe this woman was some kind of superhuman that could pay attention to 10 kids at the same time I have no idea. </p>
<p>We had our first kid this year. Itâ€™s 100% a full time job taking care of her. Not sure what kind of a parent I would be if I had 9 other kids to help raise... not a very good one. And thereâ€™s no way I could keep working full time.</p>

        <p>I know plenty of families that have 5+ kids and are well off-never been on any public assistance.  Some women handle pregnancies like a breeze.  We thought we were going to have a huge family because my first two pregnancies were awesome but then I developed an autoimmune issue with my third.  So 3 it is (and all going to private schools-that we pay for- at this time).</p>
<p>How many kids a family has if they can support them is none of your business.</p>

        <p>Every death in every article mentions covid anymore. She has a stroke but recently had covid so they blame covid. </p>
<p>I read the article about Larry Kingâ€™s death. Hereâ€™s a quote..</p>
<p>King died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Ora Media, the studio and network he co-founded, tweeted. No cause of death was given, but CNN had earlier reported he was hospitalized with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Again, no cause listed but CNN said he had covid recently. So now itâ€™s in everyoneâ€™s mind that he and this mom died of covid. It just creates more fear.</p>

        <p>The part that gets me is that this 36 year old is the example THEY chose to drum up fear. Surely they have an example of some random person who did actually die of their precious virus.</p>
<p>A case like this, where someone dies from something completely unrelated to Covid, but is still marked as Covid is the thing you would expect our side to be spreading.</p>

        <p>Counting every death within 28 days of testing positive for COVID-19 as a death caused by SARS-Cov-2 is certainly not a perfect criteria, however using some maths you can prove that the vast majority of these deaths are infract caused by virus.</p>
<p>In the UK, there were <strong>616,000</strong> deaths in 2018. These can be classified as non-Covid deaths. 616,000/365 = <strong>1688</strong> non-Covid deaths per every day on average. 1688*28 = <strong>47,254</strong> non-Covid deaths every 28 days on average.</p>
<p>There are <strong>66.65 million</strong> people living in the UK, so 47,254/66,650,000 = <strong>7.09*10\^-4</strong> as the fraction of the total population that die every 28 days for non-Covid reasons.</p>
<p>As of 9th January there have been 2,957,472 positive COVID-19 cases in the UK. The fraction of these people that would be expected to die within the next 28 days from non-Covid reasons would be (as calculated) 7.09*10\^-4. This calculates to 2,957,472 * 7.09*10\^-4 = <strong>2097 people</strong>. This means that of the 79,833 deaths reported at the 9th of January to be caused from COVID-19 in the UK, 2097 were caused by non-Covid reasons, which is <strong>2.63%</strong>. This is a tiny minority, although an existent amount.</p>
