        <p>You can tell it isn't entirely about health because those under most pressure to get a vaccine are the likeliest to die from side effects but <em>the least</em> likely to die from COVID-19 (healthy under-30s: the survival rate is above 99.99%). From a health perspective, certainly a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-years_lost">YLL</a> perspective, that just doesn't make sense, and supporters of mandatory vaccinations and 'vax passes' can't make it make sense: natural antibodies and lateral flow tests do the exact same job, and certain vaccines not yet approved (e.g. Novavax) do the job better.</p>
<p>The <em>only</em> things driving mandatory vaccinations currently, with Pfizer and Moderna on the table, are <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/23/pfizer-plays-hardball-in-covid19-vaccine-negotiations-in-latin-america/">Pfizer's aggressive shakedown tactics</a> <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-04-19/pfizer-backs-down-over-asset-seizing-clause-in-south-africa-vaccine-deal">tied to legal cases</a> and <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/pfizer-said-to-warn-israel-pay-up-or-go-to-back-of-vaccine-line/">alleged non-payment</a>. In Moderna's case it doesn't hurt that Bill Gates, an advocate of mRNA and patents, owns the medical and agricultural research industries; you can't have a good career in medical research and criticise the Gates' financial interests. I won't get either Pfizer or Moderna because I don't think human bodies are collateral for trade disputes, or <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/04/bill-gates-foundation-philanthropy-microsoft">that one cutthroat monopolist should use life-saving industries as a tax-saving PR vehicle</a>. Anyone who says, "no no, you <em>must</em> get either Pfizer or Moderna," is a shill of the highest-order, and probably a hypocritical coward too.</p>

        <p>Hard to tell, since they are suppressing even the ones we know about, so it is hard to even guess a number. Some deaths are reported as being caused by other things, while injury is typically  declared "probably not because of the vaccine so don't worry"</p>

        <p>Further more the worst effects are probably long term, one of the reasons they’re pushing so hard for everyone to be jabbed is because they don’t want a control group of “anti-vaxxers” that can prove the damage is coming from the jab.</p>

        <p>Can you tell me why you think this vaccine is so likely to have long term side effects? I’ve never heard of a vaccine having side effects that started more than a month or two after it was given, so I’m just a bit curious as to what led you to that conclusion.</p>

        <p>Have you ever heard of a vaccine that ends up in your brain? Moderna admitted that mRNA was found in the brain at 2-4% of plasma level. Now if you are lucky and your nurse is competent, not much mRNA will end up in your blood. But imagine a simple mistake which puts some of the shot in your blood vessels.</p>
<p>10 billion lipid nanoparticles in the shot. 10% of that goes to your blood, Thats a billion. 2% of that go to your brain, that's 20 million. Each non-immune cell absorbing mRNA will be killed by immune system for being a spike growing traitor. So you have a chance of losing 20 million brain cells per shot.</p>
<p>Do you want to gamble with your braincells? Especially if booster shots become routine?</p>

        <p>Because many brain injuries are subclinical that slowly accumulate unnoticed until nasty clinical effects appear. Brains have multiple redundancies and are resilient to a point. Routine boosters would contribute to a lot of people suddenly developing nasty neurological issues.</p>

        <p>Can’t getting Covid do the same? If anything this just implies the long term risks of Covid are a more serious threat, because the vaccine likely gives much less exposure to the spike protein, and brain fog is a well documented symptom of Covid. I’m not discounting that this could be a risk of vaccination, but also it seems strange to me that nobody studying the vaccine seems particularly concerned about this as a potential side effect.</p>

        <p>Can I ask you why you think scientists aren’t raising concerns regarding this as a potential side effect? What you’re saying overall makes sense, but the main source you’ve provided just says that there was mRNA in the brain after vaccination, everything after that regarding the amount of cell death seems to be pretty heavily extrapolated, so I’m just curious as to why I can’t find anything else online suggesting this specifically may be a threat.</p>

        <p>I can see why a doctor telling you this theory might convince you of it’s validity, I might be convinced if my doctor did the same. But I don’t see why I should be convinced by a theory when the only evidence for it is someone on the internet telling me their doctor told them this.  The idea sounds at least plausible to me as a layperson, but I also just don’t have the expertise to evaluate whether or not this is a serious threat without being able to consider anything other than your word.</p>

        <p>This is why vaccine undergo studies which last many years. So that all long term effects or lack thereof can be shown to the regulators who have the expertise.</p>
<p>These vaccines did not complete such long term studies. Which is why their long term risks are not possible to estimate at this time. Without a risk estimate there is no way to run risk/benefit analysis. Vaccine risk for young healthy people may prove higher than covid risk. We don't know yet.</p>

        <p>Generally vaccine clinical trials don’t take a long time because they’re looking to test for long term side effects, from what I can find it’s extremely rare for a vaccine side effect to take longer than a few months to become apparent (https://www.muhealth.org/our-stories/how-do-we-know-covid-19-vaccine-wont-have-long-term-side-effects).</p>

        <p>Good news, mRNA vaccines are pretty much identical in terms of mechanism, and they’ve actually been doing clinical trials for non Covid mRNA vaccines since at least 2012. Here’s a phase 1 clinical trial that ran for 2 years from 2015-2017 where there were no significant safety issues. I can understand if you may prefer a larger scale study, but given that there have been probably like a dozen or so of these smaller clinical trials over the past 10 years without safety incident, I’d guess at least a few hundred people have been tested for long term effects. When paired with the fact that Covid vaccine clinical trials started over a year ago now, it seems to me highly unlikely that there’s going to be some dramatic shift in the safety of vaccines that only emerges specifically in the 1-2 years post vaccination range.</p>

        <p>It sure did take some time to notice. I consider effects that take time to notice long term effects too. </p>
<p>There are about 9 million fully vaccinated males 18-25 in US. They already recorded over a thousand cases in this demographic. That is 1 in 9000 chance if one happens to be 18-25 year old male. Doesn't seem so rare now. Remember the Rotashield vaccine that was pulled from the market in 1999. It had 1 in 20000 chance of causing intussusception, a bowel obstruction condition. It was pulled from the market. And this vaccine is only half as safe for this particular demographic. And this is just one serious side effect.</p>
<p>Shouldn't we demand safer vaccines?</p>

        <p>But if it took so long to notice because the number of cases is extremely low, a longer phase 3 trial wouldn’t solve that issue. A clinical trial of 40,000 would never have caught that risk at that rate. Forgive me, but I’m not convinced by the argument that the vaccine isn’t adequately studied because there may be even rarer side effects that we literally haven’t noticed because it hasn’t impacted enough people.</p>

        <p>1 in 9000 chance for a demographic of 18-25 year old males is not rare enough to not worry about it. I already showed you a vaccine that was pulled from the market even though it was twice as safe as 1 in 9000 chance of severe side effect. </p>
<p>What if other side effects are similarly clustered, so they appear rare overall, but not so rare for an affected demographic?</p>
<p>What if VAERS data on deaths after vaccination is actually a good approximation of its relative safety compared to flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Over 11 thousand deaths reported after covid vaccination.</p>
<p>Less than 50 deaths reported after flu vaccination on a given year.</p>

        <p>Every method has its flaws. This clinical trial would probably not catch it, but if a parallel clinical trial for children 12-16 was run, that one might have caught it.</p>
<p>But we do not know, we don't have a time machine to go back and undo hundreds of millions of experimental shots already made. We should have been given a chance like they do for any other vaccine in existence.</p>

        <p>Those shots would have also been given in a timeline where they did longer clinical trials, we just agreed that it most likely would have been approved had the standard timeline been followed. What you just mentioned about a parallel clinical trial on kids isn’t considered standard, and if a clinical trial were to be done on younger people, it likely would have involved a smaller sample that still would be unlikely to pick up a trend. The only difference between these two timelines is that likely a few hundred thousand more people would have died of Covid waiting for the vaccine rollout only for the exact same issue to present itself after that started, because again the issue is really too rare to notice a definitive trend if you aren’t literally vaccinating a few million people</p>

        <p>It's insanely hard to prove that a death is directly caused by the vaccine. Same goes for most diseases. Just because there are signs of endothelial damage, blood cloths, immune overreaction, etc. doesn't prove anything as they can be caused something else. Doctors are at least somewhat biased to not point to the vaccine as they advocate for it. Also when they say they don't know the cause and that it's unlikely to be caused by the vaccine they are telling the truth. They can't know for certain and the trial data shows adverse events are unlikely.</p>
<p>That together can lead to underreporting of vaccine adverse events.</p>
<p>Btw. Technically everyone gets injured as the spike protein and immune response causes damage. Usually it's just insignificant and easily repaired.</p>
