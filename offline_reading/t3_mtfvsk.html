        <p>Sorry guys but this "study" is fucking retarded.</p>
<p>First paragraph is FULL of simple grammatical errors</p>
<p>&rt;"Although, scientific evidence supporting <strong>facemasks’</strong> efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological and health effects are established. <strong>Is</strong> has been hypothesized that facemasks have <strong>(a)</strong> compromised safety and efficacy profile and should be avoided from use <strong>(wtf is this sentence)</strong>. The current article comprehensively summarizes scientific <strong>evidences</strong> with respect to wearing facemasks in the COVID-19 era, providing <strong>prosper</strong> information for public health and <strong>decisions</strong> making."</p>
<p>It's immediately obvious this is not a good study from that alone and hasn't been reviewed by any serious journal. Referencing retarded shit like this just makes us look retarded. Please use your basic critical thinking skills if you have them.</p>
<p>There are plenty of pre-2020 studies that show masks aren't effective.</p>

        <p>This! People are so quick to trust the “science” that has come out since March 2020, but dismiss any of the science that proves them essentially useless for decades prior. “Well covid is different, it’s more transmissible. You can’t compare it to the flu.” Except if it’s more transmissible, wouldn’t studies that prove that masks don’t stop a less transmissible virus prove beyond a doubt that masks won’t stop a more easily transmitted virus?</p>

        <p>Also: "flu is virtually non-existent this year because everyone is wearing masks!" but at the same time: "covid is running rampant because there are so many anti-maskers!"</p>
<p>So "anti-maskers" are able to spread covid, but not influenza? Interesting...</p>

        <p>We need to be exact if we're not going to be dismissed so easily. What is being talked about in this article was not a study, it was an article written by a doctor giving his opinion on masks based on the available evidence. Also the only connection with stanford is that the guy is employed there.</p>

        <p>Not exactly.</p>
<p>First, the hypothesis must be tested as being a proper scientific hypothesis.  A misplaced hypothesis is not a proper hypothesis.  A proper hypothesis must have appropriate target and scope.</p>
<p>The proposed hypothesis is: "masks don't/work to slow the spread of covid, prove me wrong".  That's a meme; it's not <em>at all</em> science.</p>
<p>In science, one cannot simply dream up any hypothesis that comes to mind and say "prove me wrong."</p>
<p>Let's examine the target of the proposed component of the hypothesis; "slow the spread of covid".</p>
<p>The examination, in 'point | counterpoint' format goes something like this:</p>
<p>Why do you want to slow the spread of covid?  | Because some people are getting sick, some seriously so, and among those some are dying.  This consumes public resources at a high rate and is therefore a public burden.  We have some duty to mitigate public burdens, and to mitigate sickness and deaths.</p>
<p>Yes, okay, but people are always getting sick and/or dying.  | But these instances of people getting sick, and some even dying, due to the cause of a new virus going around can be easily prevented.</p>
<p>Now you're saying that really the goal is to prevent so many people from getting so sick and some dying, not "slow the spread"?  | Yes; the public burden that we have a social duty to mitigate is people getting sick and dying, and consuming public resources.</p>
<p>Okay, we see that the proper target is NOT to "slow the spread of covid".  Can we rationally break it down further?  WHY are some people getting sick, of those some very sick, and of those, some dying?  | Because of the new virus going around.</p>
<p>So the new virus going around makes everybody with an infection sick and they die?  | No, only some people get sick and of those only some die.</p>
<p>Is it almost everybody that gets sick, and of those, almost everybody dies?  Are we talking about the natural 2% to roughly 8% immunity that the human species would always have against all pathologens?  | No, it's FAR from that; practically inverted:  we see only a small portion of people with an infection get sick at all, and of those, a fairly small portion get really sick, and if those (since Drs stopped ventilating their patients to death) only a fairly small portion die.</p>
<p>So, it's clearly not a problem with this new virus vs. the human species, it's a problem with some individuals bodies not working adequatly consistent as everybody else's, right?  | Yes, and masks can help slow the spread.</p>
<p>Note the circular lack of reasoning.  At this point, I have to switch from try to represent how the people arguing about masks DO present their case, to how they SHOULD, <em>IF</em> they were actually interested in science, and how the scientific method MUST work to actually be science.</p>
<p>But the spread isn't the problem that needs to be solved; the problem that needs to be solved to mitigate the public burden is that some people's bodies aren't working properly.  | Some people's bodies not working correctly is the more fundamental problem to be solved in order to mitigate the public burden caused the this new virus.</p>
<p>All life has requirements for life to proceed <em>at all</em>, and typically higher requirements  for life to thrive.  Does science have any relevant knowledge and evidence of ordinary requirements for the human body to be expected to function properly?  | Yes, science has vast amounts of knowledge and evidence about ordinary requirements for the human body to be expected to function correctly.</p>
<p>Does science know if the population properly meets/adheres to those known requirements?  |  In fact, science knows that significant portions of the population DO NOT properly meet/adhere to those requirements.</p>
<p>So ordinary requirements for the humans body are known to science to not be properly met/adhered to?  |  The dependant variables of ordinary requirements that ALL of this hinges upon are known to be RANDOMLY met/adhered to.</p>
<p>Are masks an ordinary requirement for the human body to generally be expected to function properly?  |  Not normally, no.  Only in some cases such as when people are exposed to aerosolized particles such as found in a mine, a bakery, and various other specific conditions.</p>
<p>Masks are an extraordinary measure.  |  Yes, masks are not ordinary, they are extraordinary.</p>
<p>Is there any scientific evidence that properly meeting/adhering to known ordinary requirements would be meaningfully inadequate to mitigate the public burden that we have a civilized duty to mitigate?  |  Not only does no such evidence exist, there is substantial evidence indicating correlation between lack of proper adherence to worse outcomes, which in fact has strong explanatory power to be causative OF the poor outcomes.</p>
<p>Can science be a matter of "Look at me; I ignored substantial scientific knowledge and evidence about the ordinary and make up something extraordinary: prove me wrong!" |  That's marketing, not science.  For science to BE science, it must grow and build upon it's foundations.  If foundations are shown to be too weak, they must then, and ONLY then, be tore down and rebuilt.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence of the scientific knowledge and evidence about requirements for the human body being too weak for the health of individual living breathing people at large?  |  No.  The only 'lack' shown there is that it does not concentrate profit potential for corporations, their affiliates, and their stakeholders who's revenue depends on people being unhealthy.</p>
<p>What we see from this is:</p>
<p>1)  The proposed hypothesis is wrongly targeted at solving a supposed "problem" that is not actually the problem that needs to be solved</p>
<p>2)  That mistargetting lead to a proposed hypothesis of application of something extraordinary, while completely ignoring the random adherence/meeting of known ordinary requirements.</p>
<p>3)  Since science must grow and build upon foundations which haven't been shown to be too weak, any and all proposed hypothesis of any or all extraordinary measures (such as masks) that ignores what science knows about the ordinary is anti-science.</p>
<p>4)  In science, you have to break things down as far as can sensibly and rationally be broken down and get to the roots of the matter, to help make sure that the scope of the hypothesis is correct.</p>
<p>That's how science works.  That's how science HAS TO work.</p>

        <p>It's been the working hypothesis for decades. This is nothing new, it's standard knowledge.</p>
<p>The only thing that is new is the ridiculous idea that the Wuhan Flu doesn't follow the same rules. </p>
<p>Only since 2020 has this new, unproven theory, that masks slow the spread, been insisted on. With zero factual evidence to back it up mind you.</p>

        <p>FYI, it says that the masks and common materials people use does not help much in stopping the wearer from getting infected. In a situation where the virus is in the air the materials don’t matter the mask won’t stop you from breathing it in. It is very narrow in the study. </p>
<p>The problem is the headline. The headline you see here is completely opinionated. It’s misleading and tricks biased people into thinking that the situation only has one variable when nothing is just one variable. </p>
<p>Why is the title misleading? Because it makes you think masks are useless. They just aren’t. The mask controls how far your aerosol droplets move from your body. So that’s why the mandate is to wear a mask and social distance. If you do this then the spread is controlled. Not because masks block viruses but because they control movement and distance from the infected individual and hopefully not able to reach those around you. The virus doesn’t have wings so wearing a mask is the simplest thing you can do to combat the spread. </p>
<p>When people utilize this as an open and shut, black/white I know how compromised their rational thinking is. Because nothing is as black and white and science doesn’t give a shit about political lines. </p>
<p>Source: I work in life sciences. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Study is right you are just as likely to breathe in the virus regardless of mask material. However the headline is fabricated and very misleading. Masks aren’t useless because it controls the distance an infected person’s droplets can travel and this coupled with social distancing of six feet is the most basic way to control the spread.</p>
