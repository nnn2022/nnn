    <strong>Formerly healthy people crippled by "vaccine" is the New Normal</strong>
    <p><p>Since this shitshow started, I've known a few people who "tested positive" but nobody who got sick except one guy who described it as a flu.</p>
<p>Since the "vaccines" started rolling out, <strong>two</strong> people in my circle who were "fully vaccinated" (noticed how they don't say "immunized" or "inoculated" -- weird how these evil people have to tell the truth on some level) have died "of Covid."</p>
<p>Those aren't even the ones that make me mad.  One was 70 and the other was in his 80s.  </p>
<p>It's the one who is still alive and suffering that rankles me to my core.  This person was a very healthy, vivacious 20-year-old who eagerly got her injections because she's a good person and thought it was the right thing to do.  </p>
<p>Now she is basically a cripple with chronic debilitating migranes, vertigo, hearing loss, chronic fatigue, seizures and probably other symptoms (menstrual) that she's not talking about.  She is highly intelligent and good-hearted, would have made an excellent mother and a great practitioner in her rigorous field of study in which she had been performing at the highest level, academically.</p>
<p>I'm very worried for her and fear she's not long for this world, and it <em>pisses me off!!!</em> </p>
<p>Anybody else know vax-injured people?  How do we get justice and ensure that they don't die in vain?  How do we make sure this never happens again?</p></p>
