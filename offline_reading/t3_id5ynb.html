    <strong>Something about this coronavirus crisis just... does not feel right...</strong>
    <p><p>Here are some reasons why COVID-19 is different than every other worldwide crisis before it...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the first major historical event that is truly anti-freedom. The measures taken shortly after 9/11 were purportedly supposed to protect freedom in a sense. With COVID-19, however, people are outright saying that freedom is bad.</li>
<li>It is the first major historical event where one or more sectors of the general public are the bad guys. In this case, it's the "karens" who are the bad guys. Before COVID-19, the bad guy(s) of every major historical event were either one or more powerful groups of people, a single powerful person, or nobody at all. Even in the early 2000s, you weren't considered a threat if you didn't want the U.S. to "turn the desert into glass". With COVID-19, however, you are considered part of the main problem if you even SAY that masks do not work!</li>
<li>The political message that COVID-19 pushes is way less specific than with any previous major historical event. I mean, it pushes every "common sense" draconian measure imaginable! That includes environmentalism, mandatory vaccination, UBI, extreme surveillance, the end of free speech, veganism, gun control (somehow), a one-world government, scientism, increased trust in our world leaders, going cashless, intensified hygiene, the portrayal of economic growth as harmful, anti-Christianity (mainly portraying Christians as "karens"), the end of peaceful protesting, and so much more!</li>
<li>Everything was completely normal in early March. The vast majority of people still didn't even know of the concepts of social distancing and locking down. But then out of nowhere, the world suddenly turned into some bizarre germophobic dystopia. It was almost as sudden as 9/11, and for seemingly no reason at all.</li>
<li>Barely any of the pandemic's key events have particular dates. It will probably just be taught that COVID-19 kept getting "worse and worse".</li>
<li>COVID-19 will come with a very stupid lesson that future generations will probably be taught: "Always wash your hands"? Really? How cringy that will be...</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sure, there was the Spanish flu that happened, but over time, that became a very obscure piece of history that pretty much only high-schoolers knew about... until 2020 of course.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I swear.</p></p>

<p>The sad part is people keep comparing this to the Spanish flu and it is just not the same. The Spanish flu was so much worse, it just goes to show how little these doomers actually payed attention in history class.</p>
<p>We're not even in the same ballpark of population adjusted numbers of Spanish Flu. Not to mention the Spanish flu killed healthy people in the 20-40 range, and the older were more likely to survive it, the exact opposite of seasonal influenza and COVID-19.</p>

        <p>The Spanish flu killed between .48 and .81 percent of the US population after infecting 28%.  That's an IFR of as high as 2.9%.  By comparison COVID has an IFR of <em>maybe</em> .6%.</p>
<p>In Sweden 34000 people died of Spanish flu.  At the time the population was around 5M.  Today COVID killed less than 6000 in a population of 10M.  That's literally 10x less deadly, and considering it's mostly old people, the actual cost of human life in years is likely 100x lower.</p>

<p>All I hear in these subs is "I'm not an anti-vaxxer, I swear!" and "I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I swear!", and it makes me sad.</p>
<p>The campaign to vilify anyone who asks any questions or challenges the status quo has been so depressingly successful.</p>
<p>Excellent post though and I agree completely. This one is different, and there is a very strong anti-human streak throughout it.</p>

<p>the weird thing is even when you <em>point this out</em> to people they still continue ignoring that and behaving how they've been instructed. i can no longer discuss these things in good faith with certain people as they're just beyond helping. maybe they want to remain wilfully ignorant, i don't know. ignorance is bliss eh?  cringe.</p>

        <p>It is not a rational kind of manipulation that's going on. People are not simply being told convincing lies. There is an emotional dimension too. Fear and comfort. Identity and hate. Tribal stuff.</p>

        <p>I agree. That's what I meant, people are talking about things, which are clearly not conspiracy theories, but they still feel pressured to throw up disclaimers that they're not a conspiracy theorist. Or if they have a completely legitimate and entirely factual and well sourced commentary on vaccinations, they have the "but I'm not an anti-vaxxer!!" disclaimer. It just speaks volumes as to how successful the smear campaign against dissent has been.</p>

        <p>If you’re not going to listen to 99% of official health experts then you’re definitely not going to listen to some random guy on Reddit. I’m not here to change your mind, just to shame you for your selfish attitude.</p>
<p>Fact is, wearing masks has proven to lower the infection rates. Countries like New Zealand, South Korea and Germany have for the most part worn masks in public settings, whereas a large portion of countries like USA and the UK resisted them for months. Just compare the numbers with these countries.</p>
<p>Even if masks are ineffective (which they have proven not to been), then the worst case scenario is mild inconvenience. The worst case scenario of not wearing masks and the virus spreading exponentially is thousands of deaths. This is why I think anti maskers are selfish brats</p>

        <p>I'm 50. I value my individual freedom more than anything else. Over the years, I've always wondered what event will "trigger" my fellow Americans to once again revolt against the anti-freedom authoritarians in our government. </p>
<p>Understanding the ancient tyrant's tactic of "bread and circuses" to keep the masses complacent, I thought that modern sports being taken away would start an uprising. Personally, I don't like sports. I don't understand the hype. I think it's a giant waste of time. I'd seriously rather watch grass grow...</p>
<p>However, I do understand my dudes' obsession with watching pro sports. When the pandemic hysteria reached the point of sporting events being cancelled, I thought, "THIS IS IT! Protests will now commence. The line has been crossed!, Wannabe-dictator politicians will be removed from office! Get the tar and feathers ready!"</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise -and extreme disappoinment- when NOTHING happened. Crickets...All I heard when the sports cancellations were made was a silent, collective "OK" from my countrymen.</p>

        <p>What I've noticed first and foremost is that fight has been taken out of the people. Ever since the 60s everybody has to cumbaja. You can't stand up for your rights as a minority, you have to 'educate and show kindness'. You can protest but only at mandated times and only if you can get time off work, etc. </p>
<p>Governments everywhere stuck their tentacles into protests and movements turning them tame. Nobody will protest because people have been conditioned to do so and the rest won't protest because they have reason to be scared: they'll probably never participate in society again.</p>

        <p>&rt; But then out of nowhere, the world suddenly turned into some bizarre germophobic dystopia.</p>
<p>I think the main tipping point was when a few doomers started panic buying toilet paper, paper towels, and hand sanitizer. Suddenly going to the grocery store and seeing empty shelves was something actually tangible which affected normal people in their day to day lives. "Maybe if everyone is buying everything up, this is actually going to be pretty serious?".</p>
<p>It was around this time where grocery stores started suggesting everyone wear masks too.</p>

        <p>I was in the store a lot around March-April, during the height of panic buying and the stores were <em>packed</em> and not a single person was wearing a mask.  The fact that masks have been pushed so hard no, five months after the outbreak, is strange to me.</p>

        <p>&rt; The political message that COVID-19 pushes is way less specific than with any previous major historical event. I mean, it pushes every "common sense" draconian measure imaginable! That includes environmentalism, mandatory vaccination, UBI, extreme surveillance, the end of free speech, veganism, gun control (somehow), a one-world government, scientism, increased trust in our world leaders, going cashless, intensified hygiene, the portrayal of economic growth as harmful, anti-Christianity (mainly portraying Christians as "karens"), the end of peaceful protesting, and so much more!</p>

        <p>Good post; for those prone to conspiratorial ideation, I liked this recent post by <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/i9mccl/why_are_so_few_people_skeptical/g1hjfsd/">user mrandish explaining what has happened as an unfortunate conjuncture (and aggregation) of multiple localized incentives</a>. </p>
<p>At the moment the piece of news that worries me the most is about epidemiologists within Sweden putting pressure on Tegnell to copy the rest of the world and do mask mandates and lockdowns. The arrow of influence should go in the opposite direction: the world should copy what Tegnell did. If Tegnell gets replaced and Sweden goes under the new normal, we are really fucked.</p>

<p>This is very important and something to take notice of.</p>
<p>Whenever something bad happens and the government takes countermeasures, the normal thing would be to take a countermeasure to that specific problem, for example, if there are forest fires, the government has to take measures only to combat forest fires, such as build firewatch towers and hire fire watchers, maybe cause preventive fires, etc... but if they force other things such as bug eating, raise of taxes, survillance, gun control, etc just to prevent forest fires, then it means their real aim isn't to prevent fires but to push other agendas, they have a covert agenda.</p>
<p>And this is what is happening, they are using covid19 as a way to push their other agendas.</p>

        <p>And to take it one step further, was covid19 implemented INTENTIONALLY in order to move forward those agendas?       Everything seems to be running along much too smoothly from a totalitarian control perspective for it not to have been planned at some level.    I mean look at Australia and that dystopian nightmare that is already being put in place.</p>

        <p>&rt; It is the first major historical event where one or more sectors of the general public are the bad guys. </p>
<p>This has happened all the time in history, albeit typically on a more localized/national scale. The Holocaust is an easy example. Only seems like a cliche reference because it's so obvious. But finding a large portion of the populace to villainize is as old as propaganda.</p>
<p>&rt; Sure, there was the Spanish flu that happened, but over time, that became a very obscure piece of history that pretty much only high-schoolers knew about... until 2020 of course.</p>
<p>Also, Spanish Flu killed the equivalent of 200,000,000 people (based on modern population). If Covid were even a tenth as dangerous I might actually be concerned! It's not even close. It's funny how the pro-lockdown crowd loves to scream "this isn't the flu!!!"...until they want to compare it to the one flu that is objectively the FURTHEST from Covid in terms of mortality risk.</p>

        <p>I think the lesson we will learn is to not underestimate our leaders’ propensities for manipulating situations to smear others or to bolster themselves. I think Corona is certainly real; we are all <em>pretty much</em> in agreement here that it exists. I, however, do not doubt that numbers are being fudged, and I also cannot deny that news media outlets are telling me the president and his staff (Kushner) effectively “allowed” the virus to eviscerate blue states; to crush mail-in voting, our now only voting method, to ensure his otherwise improbable reelection. </p>
<p>I’m sorry to bring America into this. I know not everyone is from the U.S. But goddamn our country is a decrepit regime. Our decrying China and Russia, the old villains, is the pot calling the kettle black.</p>

        <p>I have this feeling the end of this crisis will just be as sudden and non sensical. Changes will happen overnight. The penny will drop and it will be civil unrest it economic based. My money on explaining away the drastic overreaction is that the virus has become less virulent. "It has mutated to be less dangerous and we're also out of money"</p>
<p>The penny dropping moment will be like this:

        <p>I blame it on how information spreads, by now it's not just fast, it's delivered 100 times over. Huge pressure, emotions aplified. The government parts... this first part was overreaction, now it's just "we don't go back or we are to weak to rule", basically. My view, I don't "get informed" from "a source".</p>

        <p>Some things I disagree with.</p>
<p>Many actions taken after 9/11 were extremely anti-freedom. The violated a number of rights such as the patriot act. </p>
<p>https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/surveillance-under-patriot-act</p>
<p>Being asked to do things is VERY different than being spied on from the government. Also I’ve seen very few people that have said ‘freedom is bad’. What do you mean by that? </p>
<p>“It is the first major historical event where one or more sectors of the general public are the bad guys”.</p>
<p>Disagree. Groups such as Muslims were attacked and hated by the public, even though they weren’t responsible. They can’t really choose who they are or should be forced to change it. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_the_Backlash:_Muslim_Americans_After_9/11</p>
<p>“It pushes every ‘common sense’ draconian measure imaginable...Veganism..intestified hygiene..” The other stuff is more disagreeable but I want to ask about these. How is it pushing Veganism? I don’t get it. I at least haven’t heard anyone that has made any relation to COVID and Veganism. Also is there an issue with more intense hygiene? Even after COVID, Hand washing and things such as blocking your sneezes have been largely forgotten and more people need to keep those habits even after the pandemic </p>
<p>“Barely of the pandemic’s key events have particular date” </p>
<p>How do you expect there to be dates? It’s a virus. Tracking where it even started is hard. Development on things such as a vaccine can’t have a deadline forced on them as it requires intensive research. You can’t put a real time on that. Just, what do you want dates for? </p>
<p>“Always wash your hands’? Really? How cringy will that be..” I don’t get your issue here. Future generations won’t have to deal with the virus, a vaccine will more likely than not be developed by then. Even if basic health measures like hand washing frequently stick around, how is that a bad thing?</p>
<p>Also on the Spanish flu, It probably became obscure because it’s not one of the biggest events in history and anything like it was unlikely to happen again. Of course it’s more relevant now</p>

        <p>Tons of people have stated that freedom (or freedumb, as they call it) is a trivial concern in a pandemic and should OF COURSE be set aside in the service of public safety.</p>
<p>To me there’s no of course. And the lack of an exit strategy leads many of us to fear that our freedoms will be curtailed long-term. And that’s not OK.</p>

        <p>This! Completely this.</p>
<p>The "freedoms" taken away by the Homeland Security laws were astonishing, and watching people go along with them willingly was bizarre. The same people who now are decrying their "freedoms" when faced with a real and credible threat.</p>
<p>"no sectors of the general public" - read no white male Americans...</p>
<p>There's plenty more to question, but the stand-out for me was the comment that 'everything was completely normal in early March'... yes, exactly! IF the US had taken this seriously in January, or even in February, you would have had a few hundred catch it and you'd be back in full production by now. But it was ignored, downplayed, the experts and scientists laughed at and here you are.</p>

        <p>I see that as a good thing. I don't want people to get self-conscious and/or anal-retentive about their hands in the near future. It's frustrating that nobody considers how these "common sense" hygienic measures will affect people mentally.</p>
<p>And it's not like hand washing slows the spread of COVID-19. Hand washing removes bacteria from your hands, but it doesn't prevent bacteria from getting on your hands afterward.</p>

        <p>Lmao the 9/11 measures were scary and authoritarian as well, and were also supposed to be 'temporary'. </p>
<p>I remember being a very young child at the time but already feeling scared. The measures seemed based on nothing and would only be a slippery slope leading to more shit- like our current situation. We've already been primed to give up our freedom in order to be allowed to keep it. That's why you can't freely enter a train station, why there's cctv everywhere, why you can't take shampoo on a fucking airplane. Fuck, you can't even bring a water bottle into a festival anymore. None of this has to do with safety, all of it has to do with economics and the limitation of personal freedoms.</p>

I like that you’ve chosen to troll a sub about the current pandemic as well! It really shows where your priorities lie between peoples lives and getting points from crazy people on the internet.</p>

        <p>There’s a couple things to unpack here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why do you keep using trolling as some sort of threat or punishment? I assume we’re all adults here, we don’t actually care about trolling. You’re talking about this like it’s some kind of raid or something, which would have been slightly annoying in 2012, but today it’s just sort of weird and funny. I’m doing this for my own amusement and cause I think you people are insane for not taking basic precautions against the plague. What are you going to do other than look more crazy to others than you already do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You say that I can’t get you quarantined because it’s only been implications, right after you directly confessed to planning on trolling multiple subs. Do you know what the word implications means? I wouldn’t get you quarantined because then people wouldn’t be able to come explain why you’re wrong/mock you. But you should probably have a better understanding of words before you use them.</p>

        <p>So ur saying it’s fake to take away our freedom? Also it will not get worse and worse unless we ignore cautions. Look at New York, started out with one of the highest number of cases in the USA and is now doing amazing with the coronavirus. It proves stuff can work. Also it’s like every other pandemic in our history we will find a vaccine or cure get it every year or something and this will never happen again</p>

        <p>They have partial herd immunity, not enough to make it go away entirely but enough to slow it down.

        <p>Ah I did in fact misread the death totals for the two...I saw that Spanish flu was 75 to 100 million and BP was 50 mil when it's actually reversed.  That's my mistake.</p>
<p>However the reason the SF wasn't as deadly was in fact mask wearing and protocols....can only imagine how much less deadly it would have been if even more people followed stricter protocols.</p>

        <p>Thats the real problem. People keep saying “masks arent gonna make it go away” no shit sherlock, masks are designed to help slow the spread. Every fucking doctor on tv and the internet has made that abundantly clear. But because dumbasses think high-school level history knowledge is some obscure tome in a hidden chamber in the library of congress, people have exaggerated the effectiveness of masks to try and get these crybabies to put a piece of cloth on their face. But god forbid my sister needing an abortion, choosing any religion that isn’t Christianity, or holding any political ideology besides theirs. “Land of the Free so long as you know you’re only Free to do the things I like.”</p>

        <p>You shouldn't spend that much energy on these people. Everyone who adhere to this sub is incapable of doing bare scientific research.  </p>
<p>I loved the part OP talked about veganism taking over.  </p>
<p>Like yeah, that's the end goal! To become vegan... I can't even imagine the mental gymnastic needed.  </p>
<p>Make some tea or take a beer/glass of wine and head over to /r/eyebleach or /r/Mademesmile  </p>
<p>No point arguing with stupid.  </p>
<p>Edit: from OP  </p>
<p>&rt;That includes environmentalism, mandatory vaccination, UBI, extreme surveillance, the end of free speech, <strong><em>veganism</em></strong>, gun control (somehow), a one-world government, scientism</p>

        <p>Guess what? You can still accept science and scientific fact while still being a skeptic of it all, as a matter of fact they go hand in hand. Using words like "scientism" and indirectly shining a negative light on science makes the rest of your post less credible.</p>

        <p>It’s more like science is corrupt these days. Scientific views that don’t meet a certain narrative get suppressed. Academic funding makes people malleable. Science, yes great! But in today’s climate the argument is overwhelmingly one sided. We need protests against bank corruption, or against high birth mortality rates, or being denied health care, the fact that a minimum wage job cant pay for rent anywhere in the us, or the trillions of dollars borrowers from out tax pockets that we will likely never see if we just sit here and panic about flu and allergy season ....Or against pot holes that damage our cars damit!!!</p>

        <p>You can be pro-science and anti scientism, the latter being blind faith in anything purported to be “based in science.” Skepticism is a vital part of all scientific practice and it is sorely lacking right now amongst the pro-lockdown crowd. Literally anytime you hear a new rule come down, you should be asking yourself: </p>
<p>1) are there good scientific reasons to assume this will actually work? </p>
<p>2) Are there any unforeseen negative consequences that might outweigh said benefits?</p>
<p>If you aren’t asking these questions, and you are just blindly accepting these rules without fully understanding the science behind them, then you are practicing “scientism.”</p>

        <p>It sounds like we’re redefining the term to fit our staggered narrative here. Let’s say it like it is, money corruption. Just like how a lot of dumbasses think gatorade is actually an appropriate thing to drink when you’re dehydrated. Its because we paid a bunch of dorks in lab coats to say our sugar water is good for your sweats</p>
