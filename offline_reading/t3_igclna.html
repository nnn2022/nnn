    <strong>Mask "Myths"</strong>
    <p><p>I work in healthcare, and recently got an email promoting mask use and discussing mask "myths". This whole article was written by our lead MD on Infectious Disease.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/mCqeBfY">THIS</a> particular bit stuck out to me. It both admits that A- The actual virus is smaller then the pores on most masks, but also B- that the droplets the virus houses itself in can be smaller then the pores of the mask. It clearly states the droplets can escape the mask. The ONLY thing it's saying to defend the mask is the THEORY that the mask slows the forward propulsion of the droplet, causing it to head down towards the ground faster and not infect people.</p>
<p>Considering that, though, if it's a small enough droplet to get through a mask, it's going to float around the air a LOT longer then a bigger droplet that would naturally fall faster anyway. That's what smaller droplets do. Even if they don't float as far away from their initial expulsion, they still hang in the air longer. This seems like it's trying to defend masks, but giving information that they're absolutely theatrics and not really of any use.</p></p>

        <p>I can understand the idea behind a mask being able to theoretically stop some droplets. Sure. But to enact mandatory policy based on this? It's insane. The science behind the effectiveness of masks actually slowing viral spread is very flimsy.</p>

If you're just a regular asymptomatic Joe, and you're not sneezing or coughing everywhere, I don't see how you would be producing a significant amount of droplets.

        <p>I’m still highly skeptical that this virus can stay “airborne” for more than 30 seconds or so. Calling the virus “airborne” like measles is just incorrect. The preponderance of evidence suggests droplet spread. Which people seem to forget means that very small droplets can spread through the air over very short distances. </p>
<p>At least this person is telling the truth about masks not being totally effective in filtering out most virus particles. Cause that’s how they are being presented to the public. </p>
<p>Whatever you think about masks and how well they (might) work, people should be free to choose. Mandates are simply not the answer.</p>

        <p>Think of those invisible droplets as visible vapor. When you see someone exhale in the winter, their breath (made out of those droplets that you usually can't see) floats a bit before disappearing. That's what's carrying virus, and if you're close to someone who's infected, their breath will carry the virus on the air you're breathing. </p>
<p>My own theory is that it's carried right onto the cloth or paper mask we're wearing, trapping it there and keeping it warm, moist, and alive until we inhale it. It would explain a lot of why the US, with all its emphasis and mandates on mask wearing, has so much more spread than places whose people don't wear them.</p>

        <p>Choices don't occur in a vacuum. A "choice" based on societal pressure isn't a choice. A "choice" based on irrational fear isn't a choice. A "choice" based on ignorance isn't really choice. A "choice" based on disinformation and brainwashing propaganda is not really a choice at all. These people who support masks would have never worn them six months ago. They love them now and "choose" to wear them because they have been brainwashed and programmed. Masks have created a toxic fascist cult, and as long as it's normal to wear them then that will exist.</p>

        <p>The idea that it "might" block a droplet carrying a virion that "might" <em>potentially</em> infect someone in a hypothetical scenario is all well and good - to that I say, fine. It does <em>nothing</em> to refute the studies <em>not</em> in support of wearing masks to protect against respiratory viruses, but still, fine! That hypothetical is good enough to <em>recommend</em> people wear a mask, IMO.</p>
<p>Where they lose me is using that flimsy position to rationalize mandating entire populations of healthy people wear "face coverings" or be fined/jailed, all stuck together with completely arbitrary and inconsistent "rules" depending on where/when they may apply.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://lbry.tv/@LockdownSkepticism:f/Gigi-Foster---Inquiry-into-the-Victorian-Government-Response-to-Covid:7">Gigi</a> explains in this Australian inquiry to covid response, there just hasn't been the cost/benefit analysis that would normally take place when making public policy decisions, especially those of this magnitude. And when we say "cost" in this context, we're not talking about money, we're talking about human lives, qualify of life, life-years lost, etc etc. I highly recommend everyone watch that video.</p>
<p>All of this has been supported in more of a cult-like fashion than anything else.</p>

        <p>Taking a mechanistic view will not get us anywhere. We had done many randomized control trials on cold/flu in previous years and the results on effectiveness were inconclusive. RCT are high quality evidence and it doesn’t care if we can fully derive the transmission physics from the ground up.</p>

        <p>I understand the theory behind it catching a droplet.  </p>
<p>It seems to me the mask would make it worse because the particles go from being stuck on a droplet to being stuck on the mask, then pushed out into the air with each breath.  If there was no mask, any droplet would just fall to the ground.  </p>
<p>Not to mention there aren't enough viral particles in a single droplet to infect anyone, especially to the extent that they would become ill.  All evidence I have seen shows that you need to be exposed to a symptomatic person for an extended period of time (10-20 minutes) in close proximity, and that there has been zero confirmed cases of asymptomatic transmission outside of a lab setting, and even then it was 0.03%, which is essentially zero.  </p>
<p>All conventional wisdom and science prior to CV19 was that masks to little to nothing to stop the spread of any virus, and healthy people should not wear them. Then it was all turned on it's head in the matter of days.</p>

        <p>The masks don't make the particles smaller, it just catches a lot of the particles, both bigger and smaller. The main "escape" from the masks are towards the chin, which tends to be facing downward. So the droplets that come out this way tend to be directed at the ground, so they fall straight down.</p>
<p>We know masks work, the evidence is overwhelming now and the theory is very strong. It's one thing to be against mask mandates, but trying to justify it by denying they work is just blatantly ignoring reality.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying the masks make the particles smaller. This, from a doctor, is literally saying droplet particles are small enough to GET THROUGH the pores of the mask. It's saying that the mask slows it's momentum down so it doesn't spread as far. They're saying that yeah, the droplets with virus escape, but they don't travel as far and that's the helpful part. Not that they STOP them. Which is what other science also says. My question was if it's small enough to get through the pores of the mask, would it likely float around the air longer anyway, still causing a threat?</p>

        <p>Say I have a chain link fence with holes slightly larger than a baseball.</p>
<p>We start throwing a ton of baseballs at the fence. The vast majority of the balls aren't going to get through, as they are going to hit the chain part of the fence in some way that makes them bounce back. Of those that do make it through, most of those have hit the fence in some way that they have lost momentum, thus the ones that do make it "usually travel a much shorter distance." It's only the rare perfectly thrown ball that goes cleanly through that still travels like a ball thrown without a fence in the way.</p>
<p>Of those that don't touch the fence at all, which would be the bulk of the escaped balls, they are pointed down out toward the ground and thus "usually travel a much shorter distance."</p>
<p>On top of that, how you get sick is basically an equation of dose per time. Like if someone coughs directly into your mouth, you won't need much time exposed to them as the dose/time is so high. If you are sitting in a big room with just one other person (no mask), then you probably have to be in that room for much much longer to catch it, because the dose/time is so low.</p>
<p>So if the bulk of the balls aren't making it through the fence, and those that do are less likely to reach you, then the dose/time you are subjected to drops dramatically. Which is why the masks are so effective at decreasing the risk of transmission, even if it doesn't block all of the "balls".</p>
<p>As far as I know, no science says that masks stop all of the virus. Everything I've read has suggested that the virus can get out multiple ways, including through the mask, it's just that you are blocking the vast majority of the virus-carrying droplets from traveling beyond the mask and of the stuff that does make it through, it is doesn't typically travel as far.</p>

Plus like generally what it has been like navigating feedback to your decisions or if you’ve had any pushback from ppl you manage if your view differs from the norm ... or if your training has handled that. </p>
<p>Like, if the medical review board or your office management meetings have been sources of pressure over the past months.</p>
<p>And obviously some of those questions are not at all relevant if your work is nursing vs reception vs manufacturing vs sales, etc. Like some things only apply to certain jobs and some don’t apply to certain jobs ya know</p>

        <p>This is a <em>very</em> understandable line of thinking, but it misses a few key points that make things seem more absurd than they are. I haven't been in this sub much before, but I hope my attempt at explanation isn't a violation of the rules:</p>
<p>The majority of COVID transmission is via direct contact with recently-expelled droplets, not droplets that linger in the air.  While there have been studies that show droplets <em>can</em> hang in the air, and we're <em>pretty sure</em> we've seen cases caused by lingering droplets (contact tracing is hard and imprecise), the proportion of cases that can be traced back to unprotected physical contact with an infected person is very high.</p>
<p>Your mask is most effective at protecting <em>others</em> in the case that you're infected.  That's why it's important for everyone to wear a mask.  Yes, some droplets can escape a cloth mask, but the distance they travel is far shorter. This makes the 6-foot distancing much more effective. Nobody should be claiming that a mask is 100% effective, but the reason they're so important is that they really do drastically reduce the rate of transmission in daily living conditions.  The goal until we reach a treatment or vaccine is to keep the rate of infection low.  Specifically, if we're able to keep it so that on average each infected person infects <strong>at most</strong> one other person (less, ideally) then we're in much better shape because the disease won't be spreading exponentially. See here:  https://rt.live/</p>
<p>So, yes it's possible to still be infected by small droplets when wearing a mask, but it's much less likely - which is the whole point.  I really wish we could viably protect everyone, but until then it's so important to keep the rate of infection low.  Until we have a vaccine or effective treatment, we have to do the best we can do, and a mask is the best tool we have for keeping people safe while still allowing them to live their lives as normally as possible.  This is not the new normal, it's only a transition period.</p>

<p>If you are scared or concerned, stay the fuck home. I don't want, need, or expect your 'protection'; and I am not concerned for your fears or safety. Leave me the hell alone! </p>

<p>Yes, the 'normal' that is coming is going to be far more dystopian than a fucking dirty contaminated mask that is being pushed right now by these traitors.</p>

<p>I want to believe that, but the problem is, is SO MANY are so poorly informed about any of this they believe such extremes. Saying "masks don't stop the spread of the virus, they just might slow it a bit" is fine, I can take that and go "ok I get it".  But too many others are going to get hyperbolic and start pushing "YOU'RE KILLING PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T WEAR A MASK!" and making insane blanket statements. </p>
<p>Laws and orders are being made, arbitrarily, concerning them. Mandates wearing them in, say, stores is one thing. Then restaurants get weird. Wear one walking through, but when you sit down you're good? Now some places are saying when you sit down you're good, until you order, then you need to put it back on talking to the wait staff, but once they're gone off again? It's tons of arbitrary, over the top, rules and I think they're going to last MUCH longer then needed. Because people are going to go too far with them. </p>
<p>Politicians will think they look strong, and people with little to no real understanding of these things will just say "YUP MAKES SENSE!" and support it. I'd LOVE nothing more then to think "Yeah this is a transition" but the way the public reacts, I truly can't see that. </p>
<p>Side note- I appreciate your response, and will look more into the information you posted. I'm not "anti mask" I'm more anti-mandates/laws and what I'd call "Mask Agnostic".</p>

        <p>Again I really do understand the position you're taking and I think it's a very common one right now.  I can't deny that some of the mask rules (like your restaurant example) are counter-intuitive and probably not very helpful to health/safety.  The reason rules like this rise up is because the "correct", health-oriented approach is to say "don't go in restaurants", but in practice that just doesn't work.  Many places of business can't afford to stay shut, especially given the rather pathetic measures that have been taken to try to hold people over through these times.  In addition, most people don't want to stay cooped up for an undetermined period of time (and "don't want to" is honestly a severe understatement - many people cannot mentally handle this situation).  As a result, both customers and businesses are trying to return to a semi-normal level of business - but they also want to stay safe.  That's usually how you get such convoluted rules for masks.  The people at the restaurant (especially servers who interact with way more people) are just trying to stay safe.  The rules that come about are more like security theater than actual security, but even that is important for mental health.</p>
<p>The one thing I'd leave you with in all of this, is that there are ignorant and irrational people on every side of every issue, including this one.  I know you see people saying "YOU'RE KILLING PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T WEAR A MASK!", and yes that's hyperbolic and unhelpful.  There are also people screaming "MASKS ARE TAKING AWAY ALL OF OUR RIGHTS", which is similarly hyperbolic and unhelpful.  I think "mask agnostic" is a fine place to be in all this (although I'm personally very "pro-mask"), because it puts you in a situation where hopefully you're able to make decisions based on data and reason instead of the baseless fearmongering that you're inevitably going to encounter coming from either direction.  </p>
<p>One ignorant person screaming "YOU'RE KILLING PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T WEAR A MASK!" doesn't invalidate all of the good points that the "pro mask" side has put forward.  One ignorant person screaming "MASKS ARE TAKING AWAY ALL OF OUR RIGHTS" doesn't invalid the good points that the "anti mask" side has argued.  Unfortunately, you'll see a lot more of these meme-able, easy to repeat (and usually easy to debunk), sound bytes than you'll see well-reasoned discussion.  Especially in communities that  form around one side of the issue, which can quickly deteriorate into "echo chambers" full of these hyperboles.</p>
<p>I'm glad you appreciate my response, but it was instinctively silenced by the community, without rebuttal.</p>

        <p>&rt;"masks don't stop the spread of the virus, they just might slow it a bit"</p>
<p>There is a concept of R0, which is typically how many people an individual will spread the disease to. If the R0 is currently just above 1, which means the number of people infected is growing, then the disease will continue to flourish. If wearing a mask will put the r0 below one, then the disease will slowly disappear. So they could effectively stop the disease. There have been a lot of scientists predicting that if we could get 100% compliance, which obviously will never happen, it would just go away. But the higher the compliance, the lower the R0.</p>
<p>&rt;But too many others are going to get hyperbolic and start pushing "YOU'RE KILLING PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T WEAR A MASK!" and making insane blanket statements. </p>
<p>It's kind of like driving drunk. You might think you are a good driver while drunk and that you aren't putting people at risk. . .and hell, you've done it a ton of times before with no problem. But even if you are a good drive while drunk, which is unlikely, there are tons of other people who aren't and are likely to kill someone. With masks and drunk driving, people should be saying "you are being reckless which might kill someone," so it is a bit hyperbolic, but not that ridiculous, because we are talking about acting recklessly in a way that puts others lives at risk. And in both cases, the more people that do it, the more that die.</p>
<p>&rt;Wear one walking through, but when you sit down you're good? Now some places are saying when you sit down you're good, until you order, then you need to put it back on talking to the wait staff, but once they're gone off again?</p>
<p>This makes sense because we recognize that it's kind of hard to eat with a mask on. But if you are going to the bathroom, then there is no reason you can't wear your mask because you are no longer eating (hopefully). Furthermore, they can space tables 6 feet apart, but if two people from separate tables decide to go to the bathroom at the same time, then that social distancing goes away.</p>
<p>While one is more strict than the other, and I think is better and still very reasonable, they are both perfectly reasonable and rational mandates. Neither is really arbitrary as they are creating the policy while considering the real world application. Would be kind of ridiculous to say you have to wear your mask while eating.</p>
