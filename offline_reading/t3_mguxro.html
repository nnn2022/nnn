    <strong>OSU Covid Testing Twice Weekly</strong>
    <p><p>So now as an OSU grad student (living off campus mind you and only really allowed on campus for one lab a week anyhow at this point, which is already ridiculous for what I’m paying to go here for my veterinary degree), we are being forced to get tested not once, but TWICE weekly indefinitely. I seriously can’t at this point with all of this, I’m going to lose my freakin’ mind. </p>
<p>An excerpt from the email from our college president:
“The state of the pandemic-
The positive developments – especially vaccinations – since the worst of winter are leading toward a path that we all want: a spring re-emergence of in-person activity, including our first in-person commencement since late 2019.
However, several COVID-19 variants are circulating that are more contagious and can cause more serious illness, even among younger people. As is the case nationally and internationally, these variants are trending toward becoming dominant among cases here at the university, including among Columbus campus students.<br>
The identification of variants on campus was expected, based on activity seen elsewhere and because viruses routinely change through mutation. What can we do to respond? The key is to remain committed to our safe and healthy behaviors that we know will help keep the virus from spreading on campus and in our community. We cannot let our positivity rates, which at this point remain low, increase. 
For us to progress toward a more normal spring, summer and fall, COVID-19 spread must remain low. We all want to go back to a more normal life, but to do so we need to remain diligent by wearing masks, physically distancing, avoiding large gatherings and getting vaccinated. Student testing is another critically important component. 
What you can do to help
These conflicting developments may be confusing: Are we doing better or worse against the virus? While there are more reasons for optimism right now than at any time in the last year, we have to remain vigilant. Many at-risk Ohioans remain unprotected by the vaccine. There are ways for all of us to help as vaccinations continue:
Students: Get tested twice a week. Beginning Monday, April 5, Columbus campus students who live on campus, attend in-person classes, visit campus for any reason or interact with other students and campus community members must schedule and complete two COVID-19 tests each week. Students can schedule their weekly appointments via MyChart. Instructions to schedule using MyChart can be found at go.osu.edu/MyChartInstructions. By increasing testing now, with cases still relatively low, we can prevent another rapid rise of cases. Ohio State’s on-site testing lab has significantly increased capacity this semester. Regional campus students remain eligible for weekly testing; that has not changed. 
Everyone: Get vaccinated as soon as possible. You can sign up now on the Wexner Medical Center website, or one of the thousands of locations, big and small, across the state. Check back often for open slots – they are frequently updated. The quickest path back to normality relies on all of us getting vaccinated as soon as possible. Visit the Safe and Healthy Buckeyes website for more information about vaccination, including a link to the state’s search tool. 
Everyone: Do not gather with large groups. We want students to take the opportunity to relax during this week’s instructional break, but please do so safely.
Everyone: Continue to wear masks properly, over your nose and mouth. Continue to maintain physical distance. Continue to wash your hands frequently.”</p></p>

        <p>Pretty much. This new lady that is the school president this past year is a complete whack job. We get constant weird emails from her with overt political messages too. They don’t even hide it at this point.</p>
