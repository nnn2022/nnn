    <strong>Vaccine dispute among family</strong>
    <p><p>First off, wow, thereâ€™s so much going on regarding the vaccine right now. So much discussion &amp; debate. Itâ€™s all over the news and I hear people talking about it in town walking by and in cafes. It seems inescapable. Thereâ€™s so much advertising &amp; push for people to get vaxxed &amp; to trust the vax. </p>
<p>Hereâ€™s my current situation and looking to hear thoughts about it. Me and my girlfriend are planning a trip to Europe, specifically Greece and Croatia, and part of the time will be spent with her parents. They have been recommending that we get the vax for a couple months now, and weâ€™ve both been hesitant especially because we both got Covid in the winter and had a pretty easy time dealing with it physically. I feel like I already have a strong enough defense against covid after having it once, and it hardly making me feel that sick anyways. I donâ€™t feel motivated to inject a rushed vaccine when Iâ€™m not afraid of the actually virus itself. It makes sense to me that if people are afraid of getting sick, then they will receive the vaccine to protect themselves. </p>
<p>This has all been fine since the rollout of the vax, but now itâ€™s all coming to a head as our family is a few weeks away from taking this trip to Europe.  The parents are telling me that I wonâ€™t be able to go into any restaurants, bars, museums, etc without proof of vax. And they are saying that we are going to ruin their trip. I think thatâ€™s pretty selfish to say, but anyways thereâ€™s lots of talk about vaccine mandates for employment, renting housing, traveling, and more which all sounds pretty freaky to me. I donâ€™t want to miss out on an epic trip to Europe, and I donâ€™t want to cause anxiety for my girlfriends family, but I also am still hesitant to get this shot. I feel like think Iâ€™m a crazy conspiracy guy and Iâ€™m selfish cuz I donâ€™t want to get vaxxed. Thereâ€™s been a few conversations that have gotten pretty heated between the 4 of us ðŸ˜¬ </p>
<p>I feel like if I get the vax I loose and Iâ€™m caving into all this pressure and exposing myself to potentially unforeseen long term side effects, and probable short term effect, but my family is happy. If I donâ€™t get it, I loose cuz the family is pissed at me, and I may loose out on opportunity to travel, or be hired, or rent somewhere.</p></p>

        <p>It is simple, what is the single most important factor here?</p>
<p>I suspect, your self respect, integrity, and ongoing health.</p>
<p>Everything else is just details.... </p>
<p>You may have to drop out of the holiday, which is worth it in my eyes to maintain your wellbeing/not betray yourself.</p>
<p>Do the right thing, no matter the cost. This will blow over one day, you've just got to hang in there.</p>

        <p>If you've already had it then get a test to prove it, then avoid the vaccines.</p>
<p>Get some kind of proof you already have the antibodies.</p>
<p>And you need to read up on ADE</p>

        <p>There is an antibody test that can determine what level of protection you have. If you already have antibodies, you DO NOT want to get vaccinated (I would say don't do it in any case, but especially not if you already have the antibodies). Because you probably have a strong immune system, the vaccine could cause an overreaction and cause lots of damage.</p>
<p>You can even order the antibody test online, although after that lab exposÃ© where they were just tossing them about, I don't know if I'd trust it.</p>
