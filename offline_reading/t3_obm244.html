    <strong>PSA for anyone dealing with school/work vaccine mandates: if your religious mandate got denied with no reason given like mine did, look into any anti-discrimination laws your school/work may have</strong>
    <p><p>My university violated their own Anti-Discrimination Act, which gives me an excellent grounds for appeal. If they still deny to tell me WHY my religious exemption was denied, I go straight to their office on ‚Äúequity‚Äù for being discriminated against for my religious beliefs. If they doesn‚Äôt work, I have a winning lawsuit on my hands.</p></p>

        <p>Definitely document. I lost my job of 6 years over internal politics, but they tried to say I was underperforming (students rated me a 4.3, higher than the schools average and the charters average of 25 schools).</p>
<p>Then they tried to deny my unemployment during the lockdown. I luckily document those 6 YEARS of good reviews and faxed all that to Unemployment. Took forever and a free lawyer helping, but I got mines üí∞</p>

        <p>I, just for show i guess, like to see the religious tenet that says you are not allowed to get a vaccine that would help the lowest and worst off of our society. I don't care about arguments or interpretations - just tell me the religion and the tenet that says you can't get one.</p>

        <p>NAL, but I believe In the USA, it's against the law for your employer to require a vaccine if it's not FDA approved. The Covid vaccines out there right now only have emergency use authorization, and it can't be used as a requirement for employment. Of course, they can fire you for some other stupid reason, but keep your receipts (documentation) so you can prove your labor or civil claim.</p>

        <p>That isn't the case for Houston Methodist and numerous other companies that is threatening to fire people for not taking mRNA injections. Even the courts ruled that Methodist could make non-FDA vaccines a requirement.</p>

        <p>I think they're opening themselves up to litigation. If the vaccine harms enough of their employees, and that was a requirement to keep their job, they could be looking at class-action lawsuits down the road.</p>

        <p>They think they‚Äôre in the right and have an army of lawyers ready to fight.</p>
<p>My employers rationale for mandating this says it all:</p>
<p>The EEOC guidance takes into account the fact that COVID-19 vaccines are currently subject to Emergency Use Authorization.  Some COVID-19 vaccines may only be available to the public for the foreseeable future under Emergency Use Authorization granted by the Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA requires vaccine providers to give each individual receiving the vaccine the information contained in the Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers.  &lt;Our organization&rt; complies with these obligations.  In the coming months, we expect to see vaccine manufacturers submitting requests to be considered for full FDA approval, as Pfizer has already done.  Pfizer is still awaiting full FDA approval.</p>

        <p>OK so say what grounds based on the EUA and the fact sheet that you don't accept the fact sheet. Use the FDA and CDC's own information against them and your employer.</p>
<p>Armies of lawyers lose from time to time or frequently depending on the case and event. It would depend on your conviction and a lot of other things. </p>
<p>I'm sure others can help by following up with useful information that supports my post. I'm certain this is winnable and even if its only temporarily, if the people don't succumb they can't win in the long-term.</p>
<p>You have to come at this from the perspective that you know you're in the right, and the question is how do you get from point A to B knowing you're right.</p>
<p>Anybody willing to sue has to know that they are right to do this, even in the face of others' losses. You don't go in to lose, you go in knowing that no matter what you see elsewhere this is stoppable with some unknown combination of resources, facts, and pushback.</p>

        <p>I know your pain. It's what it is. I worked for a hospital. For anything else, it's beatable, but for hospitals, I couldn't see winning UNLESS I was a doctor and had a team that doctors on my side willing to quit with me. The optics of a non healthcare professional trying to win when precedent has already been set for vaccines including eliminating religious exemptions made me also decide against fighting it. </p>
<p>Had any one of those circumstances been different, I'd have fought it.</p>
<p>I'm moving to a better state soon.</p>
<p>Last year I was also depressed. Boozing and not exercising (gyms closed) was the main reason. Isolation and friends avoiding me was another, and a third was that everyone around me had the IQ of a golf club. </p>
<p>You need to quickly quickly get away from negative thought loops.</p>
<p><em>Last year was designed to break you. The New Normal is designed to force compliance. None of this is for the faint of heart.</em></p>
<p>I will say any non health field has a great shot of winning somehow. I also feel that even hospital employees can win and get this all reversed IF enough of them are the healthcare providers themselves and back it all up with facts and their own teams of lawyers.</p>
<p>Finally the last way is to leave NY and run for local office somewhere sane and surround yourself with like minded people.</p>
<p>As an aside, I suggest toughening up. I am not blaming you for pain, quite the opposite really. If you're going to fight this thing you have to train yourself to relish some of the hatred (while not becoming what you hate, by knowing history will judge us). </p>
<p>Or learn mindful meditation or take up relaxing hobbies.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry you feel alone in this. There are so many who were borderline suicidal and extremely depressed during this insanity. </p>
<p>Lawsuits are costly in so many ways, and you've mentioned some already. It can cost your health, relationships, livelihood, time, etc. Lawsuits are time-consuming and costly. Things can drag out in court forever when the opponents have countles resources. </p>
<p>I totally get where you're coming from. You're not alone in this.</p>

        <p>&rt;they could be looking at class-action lawsuits <strong>down the road</strong>.</p>
<p>And that's why it is important to keep documents for quite a while. It might take a year for public opinion to sway, but if you can sue in 2022 for illegal shit they did in 2021, you can still win. Isn't that how all big cases work? It's not like a company releases a dangerous product and gets sued in the same year. It's always years later that they get what they deserve.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm already looking and refusing to comply with my employer‚Äôs mandate despite the fact I was an idiot and got the Pfizer mRNA shot in March and meet their requirements.</p>
<p>It creeps me out based on principle.  In addition to mandatory vaccination you have to receive a PCR test to come back, download a contact tracing app, agree to a revised health agreement, and still have to comply with random PCR testing.</p>
<p>I would bet every dollar I have that as soon as there‚Äôs a booster they‚Äôre going to use this as precedent to force that as well.</p>
<p>This is medical tyranny.  And what do I get out of it?  No increase in pay, no benefit‚Ä¶. Nothing.  Actually I‚Äôm part of a group that will be forced to return to the office while many in our organization are drawing NYC salaries and living in low cost of living states and won‚Äôt need to be return.</p>
<p>I could go on all day but I‚Äôm just leaving.  I‚Äôm not giving them my CDC card.  They‚Äôll have to fire me, I won‚Äôt quit.  Hopefully I have another job lined up by the deadline in September.</p>
<p>I notice most people okay with this are teens, or people that have never had to work for a living.  I‚Äôm in my mid-30s and can‚Äôt rely on mommy and daddy.</p>
<p>They won‚Äôt need to mandate it on a state or federal level.</p>
<p>My employers rationale for mandating this says it all:</p>
<p>The EEOC guidance takes into account the fact that COVID-19 vaccines are currently subject to Emergency Use Authorization.  Some COVID-19 vaccines may only be available to the public for the foreseeable future under Emergency Use Authorization granted by the Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA requires vaccine providers to give each individual receiving the vaccine the information contained in the Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers.  &lt;Our organization&rt; complies with these obligations.  In the coming months, we expect to see vaccine manufacturers submitting requests to be considered for full FDA approval, as Pfizer has already done.  Pfizer is still awaiting full FDA approval.</p>

<p>I've not even gotten a TEST throughout this whole thing. Did they ever debunk the weird nanoworm things on them?</p>

        <p>Hmm wonder how strong the religious exemption would be considering Jewish, Christian and Muslim countries and their leaders have been administering the vaccine and making it a requirement in places...</p>

        <p>The little research I did through DuckDuckGo brought up a college that had a fact sheet that was trying to limit/nullify religious exemptions; however we need to think like them and use all their tools against themselves. </p>
<p>But for Christians (or people recently identify as Christian üòâ) there is the concern of fetal cells used in the testing or production of the vaccines. </p>
<p>This is according to that sheet, so I‚Äôm going to do some work to verify, but Moderna and Pfizer only used them to develop, and J&amp;J used it to develop and manufacture. </p>
<p>If there is no way to verify if the cells used in any stage of development of these shots were procured from fetus not coming to term naturally, but from elective abortion, then all 3 can be refused.</p>
