    <strong>Insane thought. Preparing us for something bigger?</strong>
    <p><p>I flaired this as Junk science/misinformation because I know that this is kind of "out there" in terms of possibilities.  I just don't know where else to post it. </p>
<hr>
<p>There are so many different things going on that don't seem to add up.  The only thing that really lines up is that everyone is finding reasons to hate each other. </p>
<p>In the US, anyway, it seems like politicians are hell bent on turning us against each other on basically every front. At a minimum, they are inciting a personal liberties war and a race war.  There's also plenty of threats of world war...and it seems that we're on the precipice of financial disaster to boot. </p>
<p>The pandemic incented many people to buy guns.  The threat of disarming us has pushed us even further to stock up on weapons and ammo.</p>
<p>The pandemic also caused many people to move out of big cities.  Many people have become preppers and homesteaders.</p>
<p>Is it possible that someone with top secret code word clearance knows that humans need to prepare for something that our government(s) aren't ready to share with us?  Then they concocted all of this insanity to make us stronger?</p>
<p>Honestly I would feel a lot better if this crazy idea ended up being true...but that's just wishful thinking.</p></p>

        <p>I actually would kind of find this sort of benevolence by those in charge to be quite heartwarming &amp; endearing! Helping prepare us for an alien attack or something...</p>
<p>Nah, pretty sure those in control are just selfish, egotistical, maniac pricks.</p>

        <p>This isn’t making the country stronger.  It’s making people fatter, more depressed, angrier, more paranoid and creating more drug addicts and alcoholics.  It’s making the country weaker and more divided.</p>

        <p>You're probably right, but I can see it both ways.  I know people who have started growing their own food, learned new skills, purchased weapons and even a couple who have lost weight and gotten into shape.</p>

        <p>No, the powers that be are not benevolent, they are quick to lockdown businesses while giving themselves raises...</p>
<p>And most importantly, they have the technology now to fake an Alien Invasion If they wanted..</p>
<p>They could easily do something like this:</p>
<p>1) Pandemic to initiate control and depopulation 
2) Climate change to control survivors, where they go, what they eat
3) Famine to make people even more dependant on government handouts.
4) Fake Alien Invasion into bring in one world government.</p>
