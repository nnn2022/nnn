        <p>I think we (everyone who is not trolling on this sub) all agree with this guy. The problem is he would be (and probably already is being) used as an example of a "crazy covidiot." The fact that so many are not questioning the contradicting messages being shit out every day via every possible channel is alarming. The fact that they're happily shoving down the agenda of the day without acknowledging how wildly inconsistent and inaccurate it all is (yes, even for science it is inconsistent af), all while smugly shaming anyone who even questions it, is even more alarming. Especially in this era, where we have access to so much information. People choose to digest what is being fed to them. Losing hope over humanity here.</p>

        <p>The fact that it’s taboo to even question things right now is worrisome. Even to remark that you dislike masks (as I do, they are hot and give me the creeps BUT I wear them because they are required here) is seen as wanting to murder people. It’s a dangerous precedent.</p>
