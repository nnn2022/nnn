    <strong>This is flipping insane...</strong>
    <p><p>I’m in Canada, and FYI, a state in Canada is what we call a “province”...</p>
<p>A province in my country just introduced mandatory curfews, with other provinces throwing around threats  of curfews of their own. I feel like it’s a matter of time until it hits my home province.</p>
<p>Full grown adults. <em>Full grown fucking adults!</em> Not allowed out past 8pm. Not for gas. Not for groceries. Not for a dog walk. Stay home. A first-world country, in peace-time. </p>
<p>This is on top of masks, on top of social distancing, on top of multiple shutdowns of all “non-essential” businesses, on top of calls for hyper-vigilant hygiene. On top of calls to work from home.</p>
<p>With all of these arbitrary measures, with all of these numbers being blasted at us from every news source, with all of the passionate whining/fear 
mongering from all directions, you would think there are people collapsing in the streets! You’d think you’d spot at least 1 person in your local grocery store coughing their lungs out. Maybe leaning against a shelf halfway down the isle, ready to collapse due to lack of 02 sats. Ambulances screaming up and down streets 24/7. Screams of worried family members, asking if there’s a doctor in the building? Any of this?</p>
<p>It’s getting so surreal! What world am I living in? Who am I living here with? If this all has taught me anything, it’s who I want <em>nothing</em> to do with. This fiasco has, in essence shined a spotlight on every smug, self-righteous virtue-signalling goober in my life. At least I know who surrounds me. I won’t even get into the people who post in the local subreddit for my city, there’s no sensical discussion to be had there.</p>
<p>I’ll end this rant on a positive note. My wife shares my sentiments. This last few months, I’ve been venting to her often, as well as sharing the opinions of some of the more respected/recognized critics I come across. She’s even educating herself regarding the bigger picture, and how this all ties in with globalist campaigns with an unsavoury end-goal. I hope all of you have a partner that affirms your theories as well.</p>
<p>Okay, end-rant.</p>
<p>Edit: guys, huge win. Turns out those in Quebec ARE allowed to walk their dogs, as long as it’s within 1000M of their homes. Huge win! Vive le Québec libre!!!</p></p>

        <p>I'm in Ontario.  What I'm currently trying to get to the bottom of is who is saying that hospitals are overwhelmed or predicting they will be thus we need more restrictions and where is their data to prove it.  If they're not acting out of good faith then what is the real motive.</p>

        <p>I don't think it is either but there has to be some coordination among entities across the world.  It's not like some secret shadow organization is running everything like eg the Ontario Hospital Association.</p>

        <p>Ohhhh got it. Sorry. I honestly think for 90% of people at organizations like this, the “experts” say something and they don’t want to go against it and be seen as a quack so their automatic mental response is just to assume the experts know what’s best and are surely not up to anything nefarious. Then they fully commit to the same narrative the experts are spewing and are unlikely to backtrack once they’ve invested in it. And I think the other ~10% might question but don’t speak up for fear of backlash. </p>
<p>It’s always kind of amazed me how wrong a group of professionals can get something when the available  evidence so clearly indicates their position is incorrect. It has actually always been shocking to me how the nutrition scientists/healthcare industry peddle incorrect and harmful info re dietary guidelines - don’t eat fat, eat carbs!!! I had a false diabetes diagnoses based on a weird A1C test that ended up sending me down a years-long rabbit hole researching nutrition - like, we can fully and completely reverse T2 diabetes in most cases with the right low carb diet and the amount of well-meaning doctors I’ve personally discussed this with who flatly deny this is possible without further research is absolutely wild. Sorry for the rambling post but I think it’s just basically people conforming with what’s acceptable. </p>
<p>At what point up the ladder you actually get to the “expert” or leader that knows hospitals aren’t overwhelmed and that they have no data showing restrictions would help even if they were, I don’t know but I bet it’s higher up than we think. I could see the head of the hospital even thinking like, well, my hospital isn’t overwhelmed yet but it’s good that they’re saying this as a precautionary measure so that it doesn’t happen so this is really all for the greater good. I just think coordination on this level could be achieved with a relatively limited number of knowingly complicit actors who incentivize the rank and file to unknowingly go along with it through various means.</p>

        <p>This makes sense.  Also follows with the politicians.  Some may actually be well intentioned and not up to anything malicious.  But they may also be stupid or totally incapable of understanding anything beyond the most simplified version of the situation and just act to align themselves with the accepted narrative and response.  Also with journalists - their opportunities to publish and reputation itself may be compromises if they step too far outside the accepted version of events.</p>
<p>It really is sad and fucked though.  Because something clearly <em>wrong</em> is going on that should wake everyone up to the idea that the place this is all emanating from/the people at the top and those knowingly complicit actors, are engaging in something nefarious that has nothing to do with public health.  The collateral damage of all these restrictions alone should give people pause regardless of how threatening covid may be.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's actually Doug, at least here in Ontario. The way he talks and the way he looks when he gives these press conferences makes it seem like he's got a gun against his head. Now I'm not excusing him, the buck does stop with him, but I don't get the impression that he wants to do this. It's very clear that it's his health expert panel bolstered by media narrative that is pushing this. He desperately needs to be seen to be doing something because he's afraid of what would happen if he just went the way of Florida. </p>
<p>That being said, I noticed something interesting in his last press conference. When asked if he should be doing more and considering the measures Quebec is taking, he deflected multiple times to the vaccines being the solution. Now we're still probably going to get additional restrictions, but I get the impression that Ford is dealing with internal strife - from his cabinet and definitely from his voter base - so he's trying to shift the narrative to the vaccines instead of the lockdowns being solutions. He didn't even call anybody idiots or yahoos this time, and acknowledge that everyone is tired of the lockdowns. </p>
<p>Doug Ford has always been driven largely by polls and I don't think that's any different here, which is why we're seeing a shift in narrative from his side.</p>

        <p>For now anyways. I've been writing to him, my local MPP, and my local politicians for the last few months expressing concern. I'll tell you this, the ones that did actually respond showed me that there's a lot of disagreement going on internally. His voter base feedback can't be good, not with everything that's happening. We know that he tends to follow the polling, so we'll see where this leads us.</p>

        <p>Yes, I know 2A rights are important.
But if the loss of arms gets forced because of majority rule, what can a person do?</p>
<p>All of our 2A rights and millions of gun owners aren’t helping us Americans so far: We have Puppet Biden and his manager Kamal, a capitol 
rally and protest last night that ended in a chaotic mess. </p>
<p>Again, I am all for the right to bear arms but I am not seeing how it’s going to help us as a country,only that it can help you if an armed intruder breaks into your home, or some similar situation.</p>

        <p>When does it end? The eroding away of freedoms, over taxation, crumbling infrastructure, horrendous to the point of non existent public services. You can’t protect yourself here, you can’t speak out for fear of prosecution and now you’ll be in prisoner in your own home while our “leaders” take vacations and funnel money into bullshit foreign humanitarian causes and social justice campaigns. We already live in a communist shithole, how much worse can it get? Now get in your home, put your mask on and shut up slave!</p>

<p>Oh, that thing that's been happening to minorities for decades.</p>
<p>&rt; funnel money into bullshit foreign humanitarian causes and social justice campaigns</p>
<p>And here I've only been complaining when they funnel the money into their own pockets. </p>

<p>God, when it's someone complaining about how X is slavery, it's always some whitey who has never actually experienced slavery or even had a relative enslaved anytime in the past few generations. But here you come, elbowing to the front of the oppression line.</p>

        <p>I'm convinced they're doing this now, going into the end of flu season/end of winter, just so that the natural drop in cases can be attributed to lockdowns and thus gives them cause to continue lockdowns as the end all be all</p>

        <p>I'm in Ontario too and want to rant all day because I just don't see any sense in any of this. We still have outbreaks and the majority of deaths in LTC and people of that age bracket. I'm not saying their lives are worthless, but if the rest of society has sacrificed so much for them, why hasn't their situation improved? Why hasn't the government worked to solve that problem as much as they're policing how many people are at my church?</p>
<p>I have two young children and they are on par to lose at least a year of social development and the associated skills that come with that that is paramount to being contributing and responsible adults.</p>
<p>I've personally struggled with making friends myself and have worked hard in my rural area to build relationships to see most of them disappear this year. We have neighbors snitching on each other and the bars and churches we used to meet at are closed.</p>
<p>Ultimately I saved up a lot of money and sold a bunch of stuff in the spring to grab some acerage before home prices went further nuts. It's not much but I put a huge dent in my grocery bill from gardening and at least am on my way to some fresh air and peace of mind.</p>

        <p>Join the March for Freedom at 12pm every Saturday at Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto. Protesting the lockdowns in Ontario. People say protests don't do much, but it's a start at least. Does more than just complaining online. Also, write to your local politicians!</p>
