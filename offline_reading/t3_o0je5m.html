    <strong>As someone who has had their COVID jab and thought this would be the end of it: You guys were right all along. The goalposts have shifted yet again. The vaccines are not "not enough", so yet another lockdown is brewing.</strong>
    <p><p>I will get my second covid jab but I don't blame anyone who doesn't want to get theirs, especially those above 40. One of my family friends had to be taken to the hospital after he experienced severe side effects from the vaccine, while I remember my landlady (with whom I live) being bed bound for weeks after her first COVID jab. She had every symtptom they warned her about (headaches, chills, fevers, pain, swelling, fatigue, blurry vision, etc). All for fecking what? A virus which she most likely has already contracted since there is no way anyone would have gone a whole year without catching it if it truly is so contagious.</p>
<p>I'm tired of the bullshit. I'm tired of all of our freedoms being restricted. People can't work to feed themselves, industries are dying, many are stuck in abusive households with no chances of escaping, young people can't get their driving licenses, and speaking of young people, way to fuck over the young! We were already dealing with a shitload of issues but now they're made even worse since millions of opportunities have been wiped out because of the gov's handling of the spoooky scary pandemic. </p>
<p>What was this pain and suffering for again? A virus that kills under 2% of confirmed positive cases (so asymptomatic people and those who didn't take a covid test aren't included)? I can't wait for the Zulu Covid variant from Ukraine.</p></p>

        <p>Of course you have to do what you feel is in your best interest - but please, before you take the second shot - you owe it to yourself to listen to some of the doctors who are speaking up about what its doing to people.  From one internet stranger to another i wish you much luck.</p>

        <p>Unlike you, i read information i may initially disagree with to assess and reassess my own stance on the topic.  </p>
<p>Experts have said we should lock down, experts said kids should get vaccines despite negligible risk, experts say tobacco helps pregnant women get over morning sickness.  </p>
<p>By golly if only you applied critical thinking instead of just agreeing with anyone that has credentials.   </p>

        <p>Good luck with traveling since they are admitting flying could contribute to blood clots. I would really reconsider taking the second one. Just because someone has degrees in a certain field doesn't mean they're smart or that they aren't working FOR a company that is actively trying to harm you.</p>
<p>My sister has a doctorates and so does her husband and while they are definitely sharp mentally there are some really boneheaded things they've done recently that has raised some eyebrows. Hope you don't get the 2nd shot, and if you do get ready for a major disappointment.</p>

        <p>sure he can take the vaxx if he wants, but "blending in to survive the system" is pure cowardice and exaclty the mindset that would lead us into complete enslavement when enough people would think and act like that.</p>
<p>he is annoyed by the restrictions but still wants so play along. this is inacceptible imho! where is the love for freedom and justice? why are people so devoid of balls and spine?! its just sad...</p>

        <p>They clearly don't want to, in a system with no coercion or duress this person would not take it. They are taking it because they are scared of the social consequences of not taking it - yes, that does make them a coward, a pragmatic one maybe, but a coward who will betray their own principles due to peer pressure.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I know COVID is real, I just think the effects of the virus don't justify the lockdowns. Wish there was a community for people like me. Cause my friends know COVID is real but they still don't want a lockdown cause they need to get back to work. This is since a 1% chance of dying to the virus is way less scary to them than a 100% chance of dying in the cold streets hungry.</p>

        <p>So a friend of ours has refused to do anything until he gets his girlfriend double jabbed (August time). So he's planned a massive camping trip for September. </p>
<p>But don't think it'll happen. We'll be in lockdown by then again and he'll have missed his entire summer. He cancelled a camping trip so she could get her first jab</p>
