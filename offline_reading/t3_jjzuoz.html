    <strong>What kinds of ways you saw to cheat lockdown in your city?</strong>
    <p><p>Some cheats we did here. São Paulo/Brazil:</p>
<p>Haircut? The hairdressers had doors closed, but they have the whatsapp number on the door. You call and, in 15 minutes, they open the door for you.</p>
<p>Drink? Get at a gas station and sit on the sidewalk in front.</p>
<p>Gyms closed? After May, you could get a personal trainer.</p>
<p>Speakeasy? Know the guy who delivers online drinks for you</p>
<p>If you work at an office and not a company that has a public front open at all times (shops and drestaurants), no one bats an eye. A lawyer or accountant can go to the office in person or speak with clients on zoom.</p></p>

        <p>Haven't really had to much in my city in Illinois since June, the governor recently tried shutting down bars and restaurants again but most in my town have decided to defy his orders and stay open, luckily it seems they have the support of most of the community and the courts. People have had enough of this, despite what subs like r/coronavirus or your local covid sub want you too believe most people don't share their doomer views and are waking up to the bullshit</p>

        <p>I knew of speakeasies where you could enter with a password, operating as normal bars and one as a dance club. I knew a gym that stayed open because it was no longer a “public” gym, the owner had a few members in at a time as “friends and family”. No swiping in with member cards or anything, she’d go and unlock it at certain times and you worked out there as her friends just hanging out, all arranged via a group chat. They’re also circumventing mask mandates now and it’s wonderful. I knew dog groomers who started doing grooming out of their homes and you didn’t pay for the service technically, you voluntarily gave money to a friend returning a favor. Hairdressers did this as well. A couple restaurants just stayed open, they never closed and the ones in counties that disagreed with the governor just turned a blind eye to it. The unlucky ones got their licenses pulled and were fined out the ass. </p>
<p>We had an entire county here basically say screw this after a certain point and while they weren’t exactly allowed to say “everyone can open now”, they could say they never forced businesses to close in the first place and remove any sort of punishment from the sheriff’s office and health dept. This gave businesses the go ahead to open without them explicitly saying it, the lack of obstacles and wording used was key. The governor then tried to withhold funds from them and that didn’t end up working out so well for him.</p>
