    <strong>The link between COVID-19 and Obesity</strong>
    <p><p><strong>The Link Between COVID-19 Death Rate and Obesity</strong></p>
<p>Let me begin by saying that the virus, COVID-19, is without a doubt real. Let me also say that the virus has been completely overblown by the media (who's lies are recited like scripture by people even claiming to be "the side of science") and turned into a political weapon. This post will undercut the materiality of the arguments that those wishing to use the virus as a weapon use. </p>
<p>The accepted orthodoxy surrounding the USA's COVID-19 crisis response is that Americans failed. The United States has been labelled as the developed nation that handled the pandemic the worst. And who would blame someone for saying so when we have, <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">among the countries with a population over 1 million, the second highest deaths-per-100,000 population</a>. (click the Deaths per population tab to sort from greatest to least.) Those critical of the American response, often blissfully ignorant of the travel ban on China, feel that the reason the United States' population suffers a higher death rate from the virus is that we simply blundered. This is untrue when even the glorious WHO and CDC had no idea what they were talking about at the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But there is an even bigger elephant in the room. The blatant disregard of the link between Obesity and COVID-19 deaths. The United States has, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2228rank.html">among nations with a population of over 1 million, the second highest obesity rate.</a> Second only to Kuwait, a nation which <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/obesity-rates-by-country">the US surpasses in population by around 327 million.</a> </p>
<p>The amount of sources that back up the link between COVID deaths and obesity are staggering:</p>
<p>1.) National Institute of Health: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7346803/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7346803/</a></p>
<p>2.) Sciencemag.org : "in the first metaanalysis of its kind, published on 26 August in Obesity Reviews, an international team of researchers pooled data from scores of peer-reviewed papers capturing 399,000 patients. They found that people with obesity who contracted SARS-CoV-2 were 113% more likely than people of healthy weight to land in the hospital, 74% more likely to be admitted to an ICU, and 48% more likely to die." </p>
<p>3.) Johns Hopkins: <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/06/01/david-kass-obesity-covid-19/">https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/06/01/david-kass-obesity-covid-19/</a> </p>
<p>4.) American Diabetes Association: <a href="https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/7/1392.abstract">https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/43/7/1392.abstract</a></p>
<p>5.) Journal of Medical Virology: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.26237">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.26237</a></p>
<p>The list goes on and on...and even the precious New York Times agrees: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/10/health/coronavirus-obesity-weight.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/10/health/coronavirus-obesity-weight.html</a></p>
<p>To back up the claim further that the US's disproportionate death rate is a direct link to obesity, we can look at the distributions of deaths among ethnicity (also often used as a political weapon). According to the CDC, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html">African Americans are 2.1 times more likely to die of the virus than white Americans, and Hispanic Americans 1.1 times more likely.</a></p>
<p>The very same CDC reported the obesity rates of each ethnicity only a year prior. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2019/18_0579.htm">Combined data for 2015 through 2017 allowed for assessment by major racial/ethnic categories and found that non-Hispanic black adults had the highest prevalence of obesity (38.4%) overall, followed by Hispanic adults (32.6%) and non-Hispanic white adults (28.6%).</a>  It's literally the same ratio as the increased likelihood of deaths.</p>
<p>To bring this all home we must look at the difference between clinical obesity and morbid obesity. I mean look at the term itself...<strong>MORBIDLY</strong> obese, a.k.a you are dying already. Morbid Obesity is a serious health condition that <a href="https://obesitymedicine.org/what-is-morbid-obesity/">results from an abnormally high body mass that is diagnosed by having a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 kg/m²</a>. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The United States, the country that has had the most deaths out of any has had <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/obesity">the highest average BMI out of any country in the world, every single year, since 1975.</a> (Scroll to BMI, then click the Chart tab) So, the United States while boasting the SECOND highest obesity rate in the world (among nations with populations in the millions) also has had the most severe obesity of any nation on earth. </p>
<p>So what does this all mean? Without a doubt, the United States has suffered more COVID deaths because we are without a doubt the most unhealthy country in the world. The truth hurts sometimes, but a black truth is always better than a white lie. </p>
<p>We cannot allow the "party of science" to use a pandemic, an act of nature,  to increase government control in this country. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL;DR: Americans are dying more from COVID-19 because we are the fattest country on earth. Don't sacrifice your liberty because your neighbor is obese.</p></p>

        <p>No... I'm sorry but the 'link' between CoVid-19 and obesity is tenuous at best since doctors have been realizing "It is a 50/50 split between those who would be called 'obese' dying and those who are right-weight or underweight!"</p>
<p>It more appears to have a connection between exceptionally low levels of Vit. C, Vit. D and Zinc rather than obesity in whether you will die from this disease or not.</p>

        <p>No. I know quite a few people in my circle of family/friend who got tested and they are Vit. D deficient even though they are outdoor workers year round.</p>
<p>Truth of the real world is that people need more Vit. D than the sun can produce in a normal human body. You need an external supplement of it.</p>

        <p>Sure, I consider it an overreaction to report on this virus every day since March. Some don't but I do. I am underwhelmed by the data, especially the amount of "COVID deaths" that come from people with pre-existing conditions, such as obesity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I mean, what is our goal here? Making sure everyone is safe always? I don't believe that is possible, and I think when the media continually shoves the death rate in our face while ignoring far more serious threats to American lives they are being straight-up disingenuous. They are continuing to hit on the sensational, political topic, because after all, they are in the business of getting views/clicks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My local newspaper has not had a front-page headline that didn't mention COVID since probably May. They actually said the phrase "(my state) smashes daily death record," as if someone had just broke the Donkey Kong record or something.</p>
