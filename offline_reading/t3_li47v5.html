    <strong>What do you think it's all *really* about?</strong>
    <p><p>As parts of the world keep going in and out of lockdown, sometimes for few if any actual rises in cases, a lot of people are asking "What's really going on then?"</p>
<p>To see all the world governments, with only a few exceptions, so coordinated in all of it, with the masks, the lockdowns, etc, is very suspicious and has alarmed me since last March. When have world governments ever acted this well in sync with each other?</p>
<p>So what do you think is actually at work? 
One world government power grab? Cover for the Great Reset (and what exactly will that look like?)? Is it really about the virus and theres something about it that's far more serious than many of us are seeing right now??</p>
<p>What do you think is going on?</p></p>

        <p>https://youtu.be/I6QrYh9UqVE as long as we're sick it kills a lot of birds with one stone for them. This is a multilayered attack against humanity against our mental, physical, and spiritual health. We are more powerful than we have eve been led to believe. You have five fingers because you are. A five dimensional being however our reality is primarily only three of them. The powers that be don't want us to know this. I don't know how much of a red pill you want. However the people that rule us are not like us in more ways than just psychopathic corrupt wealthy pedophiles. however this world is not what we've been told. I don't know if you're ready for the next level of truth. I get downvoted here a lot when I even just try to expose germ theory as a great hoax.  however this book- authors interviewed in this video above - is the best researched piece of work ever done. it takes drs stefan lanka, Andrew Kaufman, Thomas cowan's to the next level.  If you want more rabbit hole About who we are and where we live and why this whole charade matters I'm happy to chat I just don't want to turn off anyone who isn't ready for the next layer of truth.</p>

        <p>Look into the World Economic Forum and the Great Reset. It’s not a conspiracy theory. It’s a conspiracy fact.</p>
<p>The general consensus is that there is an agenda to depopulate the planet to about 500 million people and  essentially enslave those who are left and not part of the elite ruling class, starting with making them dependent on the government. And before that, to just brainwash everyone into going along with it and turn them against dissenters, which is obviously working already.</p>
<p>Lockdowns, mandatory masks, censorship, constant fearmongering, and “social distancing” are meant to demoralize people and break us down so they can easily implement the new world order with little to no resistance. The never ending nature of it and constant moving of the goalposts (remember when we could go back to normal after the vaccine? Well apparently not!) is unfortunately confirming what I once thought was a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>There is way more to it than that, but I can’t explain in one comment what I’ve been thinking about for the last year. What role the vaccine plays in this, I’m not sure. </p>
<p>I’m a rational, fairly educated person. You only have to look through my post history to see that, even though I shitpost a lot. A year ago, I never would have thought I would be saying something like this. I used to make fun of people who believed in conspiracy theories because I was naively convinced everything would be ok no matter what. Not anymore and I’m not too proud to admit they were right.</p>

<p>Oh, yes. I remember when you called me a "lunatic" and relentlessly bullied me on my other account, and chastized many of my comments about the WEF and Great Reset. Fun times, having been depressed and hopeless because people like you would comment and message me about how I am a nutcase, and a horrible person for "spreading lies and depressing people".</p>

        <p>we're all learning the truth together and the timing of that is different for everyone. it's important to extend grace to those who wake up a little slower. It's very traumatic to go from bread and circus addition to being able to see with real eyes that realize lies.  The importance is being able to admit we were wrong or didn't know then what we're learning now and want to learn more.</p>

        <p>I agree. It's a lonely place and you'll face a lot of criticism to those who are scared to hear the truth however the truth creates a feeling a freedom that helps buffer the impact of this agenda. In the end the good guys win.</p>

        <p>I don't think that there is any grand conspiracy or anything. It is simply the result of power-hungry politicians and cowardly constituents in most parts of the world.</p>
<p>I've had the take that the fear that people have has a lot to do with the lack of religiosity, and therefore a crippling fear of death. Combine that with a world where living 80 years is generally the norm, and you have a lot of irreligious people who were able to fool themselves into denying the existence of death. Once that illusion was shattered, in part by a sensationalizing media being dishonest and in part by the true realization that millions die every year, people freaked the hell out.</p>

        <p>Exactly. There is no big conspiracy. It's just people taking advantage of the situation. Power-hungry politicians get the power they could only dream of. Corporations get even bigger. Billionaires double/triple their profits. Even losers get to feel morally superior.</p>

        <p>I had a thought last night. People like Bill Gates have more money than they can ever spend in a lifetime. So what does he do with it all? Gives it to countries so they'll play along with this bullshit? </p>
<p>More importantly, what are we going to do about it? My mum is one of the 'just hang in there, it'll all be fine' crowd. Yesterday I asked her at what point will she start believing that's it's not all fine? Will it only be when she's lost her home and all her rights and is locked in a cell on her own?</p>

        <p>Actually a funny point, since when have all governments worked together so hard at something? Ironically (or perhaps not), the only other time I know they've worked together so well at something is the Antarctic treaty, and the flat earth coverup. But that's one of the most popular arguments against the flat earth theory, "since when have all the governments agreed on anything? How could they all agree to do this one evil thing?" </p>
<p>In my opinion, the world is being set up to be as divided as possible and appear as unsafe as possible. They've lit the building on fire, in order to prepare for the firefighters to come save the day. 
Except in this case, the firefighter / hero is going to be the Antichrist, be it one person, or a system. And right on time, too. The end of this age is 2028, just about 7 years away.</p>

        <p>It does look like it could be the building of near intolerable psychological, physical and social stress so that they can introduce a savior type figure/Antichrist who the vast majority will gladly give in to just to finally be relieved of the torture and cognitive dissonance.</p>

        <p>Right? Totally a "saviour-ready" situation. </p>
<p>The 2028 thing comes from the idea that when God made the world in 7 days, each day represented a millennium of earth's history. Each creation day has a parallel to each millennium that has passed so far, the last (next) one being the Sabbath (millennial reign of Christ). Christ died on year 4000, in AD 28. 2000 years later will be 2028, year 6000, the start of the 7th millennium. Fingers crossed, I'm sick of this shit!</p>

        <p>There is a gigantic conspiracy going on in the background not only on global, country and regional level but also spanning our entire solar system. The planet is on the brink of witnessing some unusual solar events and events in the solar system in general. I believe they want to have complete control over everyone until this happens. So basically the NWO rollout is also just a tool for something else that is coming.</p>
<p>See Youtube: Suspicious0bservers (with a zero). Just research it I am tired of explaining it. It might take 10 or 20 years but the sun is going to literally explode and throw impactors, debris and a giant dust wave at everything near it. This has been repeating every 12,000 years. The people running the plandemic know this and they have been planning for this next micro nova and their take over of the entire world for centuries.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your comment. I'm not sure why people would go out of their way to downvote you. I appreciate that you took the time to provide another interesting possible explanation to what's going on, which is exactly what I desired my post to accomplish.</p>
<p>Someone else got mega upvotes just saying in a nutshell "youre on the right track, keep searching" like some cryptic elder in an RPG. 
Thank you for actually contributing content and a theory!</p>

        <p>Sorry I was that person.  I didn't meant to be an "cryptic elder". I regularly use that kind of response here because I often do get downvoted and don't want to scare people away from the rate at which they're able to tolerate the truth.  I didn't know you were as awake and so I have to test the waters.  I think one of the biggest things is to get people to understand that our government is not who we think they are and they do not have control and that TPTB are an elite group of people of which you will never know or see and they ensure that instead we are dumbed down with every bread and circus we keep consuming. Why? Because they know if we knew the truth about the world and their plan and who they are that there are MANY more of us and fewer of them and we could easily take them over. I think they DO see that many of us are waking up and so now is the time to enforce the end agenda to decrease the population.  They don't care about us however they cannot let the population of awake individual be a threat to them. They need us working slaves but slaves waking up to the truth of where we live and who we are is a threat to their existence. Our humanity is a threat to their survival and way of living. </p>
