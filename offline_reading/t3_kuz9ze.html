    <strong>If the vaccine doesn't mean an end to lockdowns or mask usage or social distancing what was the need to rush it through?</strong>
    <p><p>'I don't believe we have the evidence on any of the vaccines to be confident that it's going to prevent people from actually getting the infection and therefore being able to pass it on,'</p>
<p>'neither the Pfizer nor the Moderna vaccine trials tested whether the vaccines prevent people from being infected with the virus. Those trials, instead, focused on whether people were shielded from developing disease symptoms. That means that it’s not clear whether vaccinated people could still develop asymptomatic infections — and thus still be able to spread the virus to others.'</p>
<p>'The World Health Organization's emergencies program director said Wednesday that vaccines alone would not end the COVID-19 pandemic and would do nothing to stop the current global surge in coronavirus infections.'</p>
<p>So why was the vaccine rushed? </p>
<p>If the answer is hope, how can we weigh up the hope people have that 'normality' is in sight over the unknown consequences of an under-tested vaccine? The fact that 2021 is set to be pretty similar to 2020, with the UK Government even looking at 'harsher' lockdowns than our initial one in March 2020, suggests that we could have given this vaccine at least another year of testing before rolling it out. They could have had another year to try to create a vaccine that actually stops transmission rather than merely suppressing symptoms.</p></p>

        <p>We were supposed to be sufficiently afraid and therefore be all demanding a vaccine by now. This hasn't happened at all given the patently false nature of the whole narrative regarding cOvId-19.</p>

        <p>True, I guess my point is that it's just another part of the narrative that doesn't make sense. I keep seeing people say how small the vaccine uptake is but at my work (which I get isn't representative of the country let alone the world) the uptake seems pretty big. Even people who said they wanted to wait and see what happens first and didnt want to be guinea pigs have rushed to book their slots.</p>

        <p>About a week before the first vaccine was available I was listening to a call in Q&amp;A on the radio about it. A lady called in and asked how the test subjects knew they were exposed to the virus. I'm assuming normally they put actual virus particles up into the nasal cavity to be certain the person had exposure. You know what the answer was for the covid test?</p>
<p>They didn't directly expose the test subjects. They just sent them out "into the world". So the fact that they didn't get Covid, could be cause they didn't come into contact with it, like many of us. The lack of a controlled environment doesn't seem very scientifically sound to me.</p>

        <p>Wow! This seems like such a red flag. Other than going to work where we socially distance I hardly have interacted with anyone... a person at a check out with a plastic screen between us or a delivery driver dropping a parcel and running off down my drive before I have even opened the door. I'd be interested to see how different the lifestyles of the test subjects were and whether they were mixing more because if their lifestlye was like mine (which I think is fairly standard for most people right now) they'd not be hugely at risk of contracting the virus.</p>

        <p>Exactly my thoughts. If they were counting those people who didn't contract covid as a victory for the vaccine, that's extremely inaccurate due to all the variables.</p>

        <p>Can confirm that this is how certain vaccine trials were conducted and agree that it seems super uncontrolled. But one question I have is this: WHY was there such a lower rate of test subjects who got the vaccine that contracted covid then?</p>

        <p>Probably manipulated. They were gonna make sure they got the results they were looking for. This is a gold mine for pharma companies. Not only are they liability free, but will have huge government contracts on a scale never before seen (other than MAYBE with Polio).</p>

        <p>Well to answer the question and take the canonical approach, the theory is that if people get the vaccine they are less likely to die.   They may spread, they may get sick, but each person is less likely to actually die. It will save lives.</p>
<p>That sounds like a worthy goal. </p>
<p>Now we can argue for a long time what degree of risk or inconvenience is worth how many lives.  And we should.  But to simply answer the question:  You have a number of deaths per day.  You can reduce that.  So you rush out the vaccine.</p>

        <p>True and I've seen studies from China and South Korea which found little to no evidence of asymptomatic spread, however the narrative we are sold by the MSM is that we should all be scared of everyone even seemingly healthy people.</p>

        <p>Cuz it allows for if if you contract it asymptomatic cases which means no deaths and no spikes in hospitals bud. Just cuz you’re asymptomatic doesn’t mean you can’t spread it hence we still need masks and distancing for those like the people on this sub that think the vaccine is out to hurt them</p>

        <p>If the end result is the same that we still distance and and wear masks etc etc, why not take a bit more time on the vaccine rather than rush it through? Im not sure the questions raised in this BMJ article back in October have now been addressed, such as the trials not being designed to detect reduction in serious outcome? Therefore we won't know that it will even reduce deaths or reduce spikes in hospitals until further down the line, and if it doesn't then the question remains what was the need to rush it through before those answers were ascertained. </p>

        <p>The entire world literally worked on it for a year idk If it got rushed and for gods sake I think that getting covid and not having symptoms is a lot more important than not wearing a piece of cloth over your mouth. Masks really aren’t that bad</p>

        <p>As you'll see from the link there's possible risks when inhaling particles of fabric and plastic that detatches from the mask, there's also risks with the reduction of oxygen and increased co2, unhygienic mask usage can lead to the breeding of harmful bacteria that is then inhaled... I mean there's plenty more to it but the link is there if you care to broaden your outlook.</p>

        <p>Countless doctors have shown that even with multiple masks and activity that your oxygen levels do not drop from wearing masks. You can’t just go scour the internet for weird articles that back up your sources. Find some credible data</p>
