    <strong>Admittedly ignorant (and probably stupid), question about mRNA vaccines for influenza</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôve been lurking this subreddit for a few days so I still consider myself fairly new. I‚Äôve been reading various materials and sources to try and form a balanced opinion - something that seems almost impossible due to such stark, opposing views and the political aspect of it all. At this point, I remain highly concerned about its efficacy, safety and have become more and more suspicious about the motivations behind this unprecedented ‚Äúpush,‚Äù to vaccinate people using tactics such as bribes, lotteries, ostracization, threats to people‚Äôs livelihoods, etc. </p>
<p>With all that said, there remains a learning curve for me (beyond the very basic), in understanding the how and why the mRNA vaccine is so dangerous.  So please accept my apology for my ignorance or if I phrase things inaccurately.</p>
<p>In the Futurology subreddit, I read that there are studies being conducted on how mRNA technology could be utilized to vaccinate against influenza. I also know mRNA vaccines have been studied in regard to targeting certain cancers as well.  I‚Äôm curious, would either of you consider taking an mRNA vaccine for influenza or cancer if it were available? Is the spike protein that COVID-19 vaccines replicate your only concern, or is there more to mRNA vaccines that concerns you?</p></p>

        <p>I can see where mRNA could be useful in the setting of Cancer treatment. </p>
<p>One of the biggest issues with the Covid mRNA gene therapies is that they chose the most damaging part of the virus, the spike protein. They hi-jack the body's own cells to manufacture thousands of these harmful proteins which cross react with heart, blood vessels, reproductive organs, etc. They cross the placenta and the blood-brain barrier. </p>
<p>They're a recipe for autoimmune disaster. </p>
<p>Using gene therapy in someone dying from cancer is also a whole different thing than injecting harmful toxins into 100% healthy people AND people who've already recovered and have natural, long-lasting, superior immunity.</p>

        <p>I've completely lost faith in the medical establishment.</p>
<p>You mention mRNA for cancer while we ignore the myriad of studies showing that whole plant marijuana extract kills cancer more effectively than any current treatment methods, even with the NIDA monopoly on shwag research plants ending a little over 1 month ago...</p>
<p>It's never been about curing people, because then there would be no customers...</p>

<p>Marijuana aint just for fun,</p>

<p>"Not for Medical".. hypocrite..</p>
<p>Copy cannabinoids then selling it.</p>
<p>Synthetic Analogs are Schedule 2</p>
<p>Saying it''ll make you go cuckoo</p>
<p>Marinol's THC and helps with cancer</p>
<p>But what is the DEAs answer?</p>
<p>Smoke a joint and go to the joint</p>
<p>"Not for medical" while doling out doinks</p>
<p>It don't make sense, that's the point</p>
<p>Handing out MMJ as IND</p>
<p>Yes indeed, they're full of greed</p>
<p>But Marijuana has <em>all u need</em></p>

<p>Help with an ache, no addictive need</p>

        <p>That's fair. When I get a chance it's worth looking into the history and chemistry.</p>
<p>Bc even with cannabinoids, they've made synthetic versions to treat ailments, the government hands it out as an IND, and your body naturally produces cannabinoids (<em>and when you don't can cause illnesses)</em> which is now being called Endocannabinoid Deficiency Syndrome.</p>

        <p>I am 30 and have never needed surgery etc. I am not from the West and only had half of the vaxxes for the 6 diseases that kids in my country were vaxxed against back in the 90s. As you can tell, I died and am talking to you via a Ouija board.</p>
<p>LOL, if you're from the West, you missed your TB vaxx but you didn't die from TB, did you? It's almost as if living in sanitary conditions plus having a healthy diet + exercise will boost your immune system or something. </p>
<p>I always laugh at how pro-vaxxers, esp the ones from the US (the country that throws the most vaxxes at its kids despite having the HIGHEST child mortality rate in the developed world!!!) are so brainwashed to never question the SaFe AnD eFfEcTiVe vaxxes which also have a $3B+ vaxx injury compensation fund.</p>

        <p>Are you aware that there are 13M Americans with latent TB infection, meaning that they have an infection that is just waiting for their immune system to go off-line before TB ravages their bodies. This number doesn't even include the 30-40M illegal residents in the US whose TB status is unknown. Have you ever wondered why TB is not on the recommended vaxx list for Americans travelling to 3rd world, TB-rife countries? </p>

        <p>‚ÄòI won‚Äôt even need surgery‚Äô, you‚Äôll remember writing this when you need one. I mean, unless you can see the future‚Ä¶.</p>
<p>Latent TB isn‚Äôt contagious like it is for people that are actively coughing. Plus we have treatment for it. Hell, I‚Äôd be shocked to hear we see more than 1000 TB deaths a year in the USA compared to covid and its +500k so far. As far as why we don‚Äôt recommend the tb vaccine I‚Äôm honestly not sure; could be the effective treatment we have or simply that it‚Äôs low in terms of effectiveness</p>

        <p>I won't need surgery because I don't follow a Western diet and lifestyle despite living in Europe now. I am 30 and have never even gotten as much as a cavity. We have effective treatments for C19 - HCQ, ivermectin, vit D, etc - but you and your BigPharma shills suppressed them because they are generic.</p>
<p>Not that I am surprised that you made the false equivalence between anaesthetics (which were used by Sumerians as early as 3450BC) and vaccines whose ingredients you can't even name.</p>
<p>Back to the drawing board, buddy.</p>

        <p>Of course, you‚Äôre anti-medicine, but can‚Äôt help but to mention the holy grail of bullshit; ivermectin and hdcq, neither of which are proven to work. </p>

        <p>We're in July 2021. If you haven't read the peer-reviewed articles that PROVE that ivermectin and HCQ work, it just shows that you're not an intellectually curious person who has participated in the world's largest human experiment without being informed. If you ever want to see the papers showing that cheap, generic, decades-old treatments already exist, don't hesitate to contact me.</p>

        <p>I don't get flu vaccines now and they're normal vaccines, so no, I definitely would not touch an mRNA vaccine for flu. And they're not going to make one for "cancer." Maybe a specific <em>type</em> of cancer, but even then I don't want it. I'm not at unusually high risk for any particular kind of cancer, just the normal baseline risk that comes with living on Earth.</p>

        <p>I did refer to ‚Äúcertain cancers,‚Äù in my op, but perhaps I was unclear or too broad in how I phrased it. I didn‚Äôt mean to imply ‚Äúcancer,‚Äù in such generalized terms.</p>
<p>To make sure I understand correctly, because you don‚Äôt have any risk factors within your family history that point to you being at a higher risk of developing a specific cancer, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôd rather not take an mRNA vaccine that MIGHT target that? Would that change if you were at higher risk? I‚Äôm just trying to determine what exactly about the mRNA vaccine is a cause of concern for some people. Is it the spike protein introduced by the COVID-19 version? The fact that it‚Äôs synthetic DNA manipulation? Other variable factors? </p>
<p>I ask out of genuine curiosity - I don‚Äôt want to be misinterpreted as challenging you or your decision. I respect and support that üíØ and truthfully, I feel similarly to you. I just want to discuss people‚Äôs reasoning behind those decisions and hopefully learn from them.</p>
