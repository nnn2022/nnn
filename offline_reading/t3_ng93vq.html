    <strong>One of them finally admits "I was Wrong"</strong>
    <p><p>This is an excerpt from the <a href="https://tomwoods.com/">Tom Woods</a> Newsletter:</p>
<p>It's been so rare over the past 14 months to encounter someone who looks back on the madness and says, "I was wrong."</p>
<p>Well, today I want to share some honesty with you, courtesy of @ angrybklynmom on Twitter.</p>
<p>I think you'll appreciate it:</p>
<p>"<strong><em>I have to make some confessions. Last year, I was absolutely insane and I was one of those people who yelled at people outside for not wearing a mask. It wasn't actually the virus that I was afraid of, but the lockdowns.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I was so deeply psychologically damaged from the NYC lockdown in the spring that I lived in perpetual terror of it happening again. Cuomo spent the entire summer and fall threatening and browbeating us for our "bad behavior" and I deeply internalized this message.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I remember screaming at my neighbors and telling them that if they didn't put on a mask, they were going to face my wrath if my kids' school was closed. At one point, Cuomo put us into an arbitrary microcluster and we escaped closed schools by only a few blocks.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I spent the entire school year watching every stupid metric and desperately trying to get three steps ahead of Cuomo. I was very lucky that my children's (Catholic) school was never closed. One child had two quarantines (and one was over a break). We got incredibly lucky.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>To be clear, I never supported the lockdowns. I thought they were an abomination. Pure psychological torture. Masks felt like the compromise to keep us out of lockdown, and I got angry when everyone wouldn't comply to keep us out of lockdown.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If you go back and watch Cuomo's briefings, the threat of closures (dependent on our behavior!) was a daily phenomenon. And when they happened, they were metric-free, indefinite in nature, arbitrary and capricious. Completely at the whim of one man, and one man only.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The reason I wasn't as personally concerned about the actual virus as I was about the lockdowns is that I felt confident that I knew how to protect my family; data already showed the severe age stratification.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>But lockdowns were something completely out of our control. We opened the door to something new and nefarious: (inept) governmentts having 100% power over their citizens' doings, with fear as a powerful motivator for compliance. My fear was that we might never fully claw back that power.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I had no trust in our government's competence, nor in its ability to put the well-being of citizens ahead of their own aspirations and desire for power. I had no trust that they were consulting the right experts, or were effectively leveraging the data to make informed decisions....</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>It shouldn't need to be explicitly stated that it's not sustainable (or humane) to demand people sacrifice time with loved ones, education, livelihood, and socialization for months on end, or even YEARS. Yet, this was/is unapologetically the expectation in many parts of the US.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>To this day, this is still an expectation in some areas, even after having a year+ worth of data from restricted vs open states proving that these profound sacrifices are not correlated with better viral outcomes.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>&lt;End Excerpt&rt;            </p>
<p>My own personal thoughts (OP):</p>
<p>Most government officials, and bureaucrats are control freaks, many are blatantly cruel, and some are outright sociopaths and/or narcissist's. Scientists and  health officials have had a year of being media celebrities. These are fallible humans, with egos, hubris, and unknown motivations. Positions of power, whether they be in the public or private sector, attract these personality types.</p>
<p>When government officials are removing your rights and liberties, the last thing to do is comply. Complying with tyranny is the equivalent of giving up your lunch money to the bully. The bully will never stop until you push back. This is where the phrase "We don't negotiate with terrorists" comes from. It's the same model ransomware hackers and patent trolls use. If you comply and give the bullies what they want, they learn they can get away with it. Historically, governments never get smaller, only bigger and more intrusive. They only stop encroaching when they receive pushback, either in the form of non-compliance or a change in laws.</p>
<p>Getting angry at those who refuse to comply with unjust, unconstitutional, and anti-human orders, is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a>. And the compliance itself is a real world example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">Milgram Experiment</a>. Imagine a group of thugs hold up a supermarket at gunpoint. They refuse to let anyone go until everyone recites and pledges allegiance to their manifesto. Some people refuse out of principle. Those who refuse are not the enemy. The thugs are. Holding liberties hostage until compliance does not shift the burden to the hostages. Yet this is exactly what we've seen this year.</p>
<p>If you allow your liberties and freedom to be contingent on arbitrary rules that a bureaucrat demands. You don't have freedoms at all, you have privilege's, and you are a slave living in a very large open air plantation. </p>

        <p>One of my favorite questions to ask people is where is the line for you? If one of your kids gets infected and they take them by force and put them in a quarantine facility, would that be too far? How about if they committed to a full year stay at home order? What if they were allowed to bug your phone and car for the purposes of contact tracing? </p>
<p>Most people arent pure utilitarians and can accept that some things really ought to be inviolable (although I've met way to many utilitarians on other subs). I find it nice if we can agree on a principle.</p>
<p>Nice analogy about the supermarket hostages.</p>

        <p>That's just it. Once someone admits where their line is you point to the fundamental freedoms that would ensure that's not allowed and almost always they are chipping away at it 'because COVID'</p>

        <p>And after all that, in all that time, it appears that he STILL has never started taking personal responsibility for his own health, learned ANYTHING new about nutrition, and all the less so prompted others to start learning about the foundation of health.</p>
