    <strong>Scientific evidence and cross-country variability in cloth mask policies</strong>
    <p><p>LAST UPDATED on <strong>July 17, 2021</strong></p>
<p>This post focuses strictly on the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bioe.12840">controversial</a> issue of recommending or <a href="https://www.thehastingscenter.org/briefingbook/pandemic/">mandating</a> cloth masks <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3840787">for the general public</a> during COVID-19. For a regularly updated executive summary of the evolving scientific understanding of COVID-19 in general, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jz71p9/sarscov2_in_light_of_recent_scientific_research/">see here</a>. Overall, the available scientific and policy evidence indicates that mandating or even just formally recommending to the general public to wear a cloth mask in nonhealthcare settings is <a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/november-2020/welcome-to-covidworld/">unwise</a>. These <a href="https://healthydebate.ca/opinions/an-open-letter-to-pm-covid19">23 highly respected Canadian epidemiologists and public health experts</a> have recommended the following standard for all COVID-19 related policies: 
&rt;COVID-19 control must be balanced with basic human rights.  People need to be empowered to make informed choices about their own lives and the level of risk they are prepared to accept.  Universal public health measures are appropriate only when they are truly necessary, supported by <em>strong</em> evidence, and when there are no other alternatives...Any requirements for mandatory masks must be based on <em>strong</em> evidence...</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the foregoing standard, what follows is a review of the academic literature demonstrating that the requirement for <em><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.21.20208728v2">strong</a></em> evidence is <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3473">not</a> being met (the other components of the foregoing standard pertaining to human rights and personal autonomy are discussed in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hosvhw/an_updated_critique_of_the_twopronged_idea_that_a/">section #2 of this</a> post). </p>

<p><strong>May 25, 2021</strong> preprint by <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.21257385v1">(Guerra &amp; Guerra, 2021)</a> <em>Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment</em>: 
&rt;Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. 
&rt;Prolonged mask use (&rt;4 hours per day) promotes facial alkalinization and inadvertently encourages dehydration, which in turn can enhance barrier breakdown and bacterial infection risk [33]. British clinicians have reported masks to increase headaches and sweating and decrease cognitive precision [34]. Survey bias notwithstanding, these sequelae are associated with medical errors [35]. By obscuring nonverbal communication, masks interfere with social learning in children [36]. Likewise, masks can distort verbal speech and remove visual cues to the detriment of individuals with hearing loss.</p>

<p><strong>May 21, 2021</strong>, preprint by <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.19.21257467v1">(Oster et al., 2021)</a> <em>COVID-19 Mitigation Practices and COVID-19 Rates in Schools: Report on Data from Florida, New York and Massachusetts</em>: 
&rt;Ventilation upgrades are correlated with lower rates in Florida but not in New York. We do not find any correlations with mask mandates. All rates are lower in the spring, after teacher vaccination is underway. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>April 20th 2021</strong>, <em>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</em> published the systematic review <em>Is a Mask That Covers the Mouth and Nose Free from Undesirable Side Effects in Everyday Use and Free of Potential Hazards?</em>, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/8/4344/htm">(Kisielinski et al., 2021)</a>: 
&rt; For a quantitative evaluation, 44 mostly experimental studies were referenced, and for a substantive evaluation, 65 publications were found. The literature revealed relevant adverse effects of masks in numerous disciplines. In this paper, we refer to the psychological and physical deterioration as well as multiple symptoms described because of their consistent, recurrent and uniform presentation from different disciplines as a Mask-Induced Exhaustion Syndrome (MIES). We objectified evaluation evidenced changes in respiratory physiology of mask wearers with significant correlation of O2 drop and fatigue (p &lt; 0.05), a clustered co-occurrence of respiratory impairment and O2 drop (67%), N95 mask and CO2 rise (82%), N95 mask and O2 drop (72%), N95 mask and headache (60%), respiratory impairment and temperature rise (88%), but also temperature rise and moisture (100%) under the masks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>February 2021</strong>, the academic journal <em>Aerosol and Air Quality Research</em> published <em>Effect of Wearing Face Masks on the Carbon Dioxide Concentration in the Breathing Zone</em>, <a href="https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-20-07-covid-0403">(Geiss, 2021)</a>. The empirical study's abstract: 
&rt;the carbon dioxide concentration in the breathing zone was measured while wearing a surgical mask, a KN95 and a cloth mask. For the surgical mask, the concentration was determined under different conditions (office work, slow walking, and fast walking)...Detected carbon dioxide concentrations ranged from <strong>2150</strong> ± 192 to <strong>2875</strong> ± 323 ppm. <strong>The concentrations of carbon dioxide while not wearing a face mask varied from 500–900 ppm</strong>...Walking at a speed of 5 km h–1...resulted in an average carbon dioxide concentration of <strong>2875</strong> ppm. No differences were observed among the three types of face masks tested. According to the literature, these concentrations have no toxicological effect. However, <strong>concentrations in the detected range can cause undesirable symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, and loss of concentration</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>February 2021</strong>, <em>The Lancet</em> published <em>Transmission of COVID-19 in 282 clusters in Catalonia, Spain: a cohort study</em>, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099%2820%2930985-3">(Marks et al., 2021)</a>. The authors noted in the Discussion section (page 7): 
&rt;We did not find <strong>any</strong> evidence of decreased risk of transmission in individuals who reported mask use. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>January 2021</strong>, <em>The Journal of Hazardous Materials</em> published <em>COVID-19: Performance study of microplastic inhalation risk posed by wearing masks</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389420329460">(Li et al., 2021)</a>. The main empirical result was: 
&rt;Wearing masks poses microplastic inhalation risk, reusing masks increases the risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>January 2021</strong>, <em>PLOS One</em> published, <em>Comparing the fit of N95, KN95, surgical, and cloth face masks and assessing the accuracy of fit checking</em>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245688">(O'Kelly et al., 2021)</a>. The authors noted: 
&rt;This study confirms that NIOSH certification that a mask can perform at N95 levels alone is insufficient if the mask is poor fitting. <strong>Proper fit is absolutely necessary if the mask is to offer the wearer protection</strong>. Furthermore, our results indicate it is not enough to assume that any N95 respirator will be likely to fit the majority of a population. The most widely fitting mask, the 8511 N95, fit only three out of the seven participants. Other masks, such as the Aero Pro and Xiantao Zong, did not fit any of the participants adequately.</p>

<p><strong>18 December</strong> 2020, in <em>Face masks for preventing respiratory infections in the community: A systematic review</em>, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.16.20248316v1">(Saijonkari et al., 2020)</a> concluded: 
&rt;The reported effect of masks used outside the home on transmission of droplet-mediated respiratory infections in the population is minimal or non-existent. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>20 November</strong> 2020, <em>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</em> published <em>Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses</em>, <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5/epdf/abstract">(Jefferson et al., 2020)</a>. The review noted: 
&rt;Medical or surgical masks: Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes <strong>no difference</strong> in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort. N95/P2 respirators: Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well reported; discomfort was mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>18 November</strong> 2020, <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> published <em>Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers. 
A Randomized Controlled Trial</em>, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">(Bundgaard et al., 2020)</a>. This is the first and only RCT we have on mask effectiveness against COVID-19 in community settings, but its findings of ineffectiveness are fully expected in light of all the other RCTs we have on other respiratory viruses. The results of the study: 
&rt;A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. <strong>Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>17 November</strong> 2020, <em>International Journal of Infectious Diseases</em> published <em>Meta-analysis on facemask use in community settings to prevent respiratory infection transmission shows no effect</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220324504">(Gómez-Ochoa &amp; Muka, 2020)</a>. The authors noted: 
&rt;there were no significant differences between medical facemasks use only and controls in the odds of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness. Similarly, no differences in laboratory-confirmed influenza risk were observed when comparing mask use solely versus combined intervention of face mask and handwashing, indicating that facemask as solely intervention in community is not associated with reducing respiratory infection. Given the studies used medical masks, cloth masks' efficacy is expected to be even lower; a randomized cluster trial showed that respiratory infection is higher among health care personnel using cloth masks than using medical masks (MacIntyre et al., 2015)...Due to these divergent results and the lack of high-quality research in this area, strong recommendations for facemask use in the community context should be issued with caution until new evidence is available to show their effectiveness. This is even more important, considering that several studies showed that mask use is associated with headache incidence and worsening of pre-existing headache (Lim et al., 2006, Rebmann et al., 2013, Szeinuk et al., 2000, Radonovich, 2009, Shenal et al., 2011).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>27 October</strong> 2020, <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> published "Update Alert 3: Masks for Prevention of Respiratory Virus Infections, Including SARS-CoV-2, in Health Care and Community Settings" (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L20-1292">Chou et al., 2020</a>), to summarize very recent research on masks up until 2 October 2020. The authors noted the serious methodological limitations of the more recent studies and concluded: 
&rt;The strength of evidence for mask use and risk for SARS-CoV-2 in <em>community settings</em> remained insufficient...Evidence for mask use versus nonuse and comparing masks types in <em>health care settings</em> remained insufficient...There were no new studies on the effectiveness and safety of mask reuse or extended use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>25 September</strong> 2020, the academic journal <em>Frontiers in Medicine</em> published <em>Effectiveness of Surgical Face Masks in Reducing Acute Respiratory Infections in Non-Healthcare Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</em>, by <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.564280/full">(Wang et al., 2020)</a>. The review failed to find a statistically significant effect and concluded: 
&rt;Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is <strong>not significantly associated</strong> with reduction in ARI [acute respiratory infections] incidence in this meta-review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>22 September</strong> 2020, the academic journal <em>Environmental Research</em> published <em>The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain: Hygiene habits, sociodemographic profile, mobility patterns and comorbidities</em>, by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120311208?via=ihub">(Rodríguez-Barranco et al., 2021)</a>. The authors noted (the quote is from section 5.1. - page 7 of the pdf.): 
&rt;<strong>In the case of masks, the results of this study slightly suggest the opposite effect to that of protection</strong>, possibly due to misuse of masks by the general population untrained in their use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On 23 July 2020, <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine</a> has issued an overview of the <em>ongoing</em> research on cloth mask efficacy. The authors stated that: 
&rt;The increasing polarised and politicised views on whether to wear masks in public during the current COVID-19 crisis hides a bitter truth on the state of contemporary research and the value we pose on clinical evidence to guide our decisions...There is <em>considerable</em> uncertainty as to the value of wearing masks. For instance, <em>high rates of infection with cloth masks could be due to harms caused by cloth masks</em>...The numerous systematic reviews that have been recently published all include the same evidence base so unsurprisingly broadly reach the same conclusions. However, recent reviews <em>using lower quality evidence</em> found masks to be effective...This abandonment of the scientific modus operandi and lack of foresight has left the field wide open for the play of opinions, radical views and political influence. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1435/rr-43">University of Cambridge biomedical scientists have written in 2020 in the British Medical Journal</a>: 
&rt;The evidence for the effectiveness of face masks in reducing viral transmission is <em>very weak</em>. Few studies examine the use of face masks in community settings; those that do find <em>no evidence of reduced transmission compared with no face masks</em>...Efforts to communicate a position so strongly in favour of widespread use of masks in the community...in the face of persistent evidence gaps, <em>risk promoting policy based more on eminence than evidence</em>. The unintended consequences of unequivocal advocacy of a contested position go beyond the downsides of policy implementation: they include the potential erosion of trust in science more generally, when the measures put forward fail to live up to their promise, or result in problems that could be, or had been, anticipated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gold standard of evidence in biomedical research is the randomized controlled trial. A <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">systematic review</a> of cloth mask research published in 2020 in the academic journal <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em> of the <em>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</em> concluded that: 
&rt;Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did <em>not</em> support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The foregoing finding has been reinforced by a Bayesian analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials. <a href="https://www.qeios.com/read/1SC5L4">Perski et al., 2020</a>, concluded: 
&rt;Available evidence from RCTs is <em>equivocal</em> as to whether or not wearing face masks in community settings results in a reduction in clinically- or laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A systematic review by <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1">Brainard et al., 2020</a>, concluded: 
&rt;The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A systematic review and meta-analysis by <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2">Jefferson et al., 2020</a>, noted: 
&rt;We included 15 randomised trials investigating the effect of masks (14 trials) in healthcare workers and the general population and of quarantine (1 trial). We found no trials testing eye protection. Compared to no masks there was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A most recent systematic review of 18 randomized controlled trials and of 11 other systematic reviews by <a href="https://www.cfp.ca/content/66/7/509.abstract">Dugré et al., 2020</a>, concluded: 
&rt;This systematic review found limited evidence that the use of masks might reduce the risk of viral respiratory infections. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of potential health risks of face masks by <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20133207v1">Bakhit et al., 2020</a>, concluded that: 
&rt;There are <em>insufficient data to quantify all of the adverse effects</em> that might reduce the acceptability, adherence, and effectiveness of face masks. New research on facemasks should assess and <em>report the harms and downsides</em>. Urgent research is also needed on methods and designs to mitigate the downsides of facemask wearing, particularly the assessment of alternatives such as face shields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A peer-reviewed paper from August 2020 by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09581596.2020.1797997">Martin et al., 2020</a> assessing the overall wisdom of recommending masks for the general public, noted: 
&rt;There is very limited evidence that cloth face coverings reduce the burden of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19...Few studies examine the use of face coverings in community settings: when taken in aggregate, those that do find no statistically significant evidence of reduced transmission compared with no face coverings...Rather than communicate a falsely unequivocal message about the value of face coverings, researchers should articulate scientific disagreement, the nature of scientific uncertainty, and its implications for how we act to improve knowledge and action.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-and-masks">World Health Organization</a> admits to this day that: 
&rt;Non-medical, fabric masks are being used by many people in public areas, but there has been limited evidence on their effectiveness...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A September 2020 empirical study (preprint) by <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">(van den Broek-Altenburg et al., 2020)</a> highlighted the foolishness of rushing to recommend or mandate masks for the general public. One of the study's key findings was that:<br>
&rt;...Wearing a facial mask outside work <strong>increased</strong> probability of COVID-19 infection.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>An open letter from <a href="https://docs4opendebate.be/en/open-letter/">September 2020</a> signed by 418 medical doctors states: 
&rt;...Masks belong in contexts where contacts with proven at-risk groups or people with upper respiratory complaints take place, and in a medical context/hospital-retirement home setting. They reduce the risk of droplet infection by sneezing or coughing. Oral masks in healthy individuals are ineffective against the spread of viral infections. Wearing a mask is not without side effects. Oxygen deficiency (headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of concentration) occurs fairly quickly, an effect similar to altitude sickness. Every day we now see patients complaining of headaches, sinus problems, respiratory problems and hyperventilation due to wearing masks. In addition, the accumulated CO2 leads to a toxic acidification of the organism which affects our immunity. Some experts even warn of an increased transmission of the virus in case of inappropriate use of the mask. Our Labour Code (Codex 6) refers to a CO2 content (ventilation in workplaces) of 900 ppm, maximum 1200 ppm in special circumstances. After wearing a mask for one minute, this toxic limit is considerably exceeded to values that are three to four times higher than these maximum values. Anyone who wears a mask is therefore in an extreme poorly ventilated room. Inappropriate use of masks without a comprehensive medical cardio-pulmonary test file is therefore not recommended by recognised safety specialists for workers. Hospitals have a sterile environment in their operating rooms where staff wear masks and there is precise regulation of humidity / temperature with appropriately monitored oxygen flow to compensate for this, thus meeting strict safety standards. </p>

<p>Almost 100% of known transmissions of corona happen from extended interaction (home, work, public transit) - you are very unlikely to get it from a stranger passing you by the sidewalk or by a grocery aisle - see <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com./2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html">here</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloth masks are ineffective against transmission of COVID-19 through aerosolized respiratory droplets (i.e. smaller droplets &lt;5 μm that remain in the air for hours) and this airborne route of transmission has just been emphasized by many experts to be the most likely primary means of infection. The solutions that would work to address this route are not cloth masks, which can filter only larger droplets (&rt;5 μm), but "social distancing, limiting interaction indoors, avoiding air recirculation, improved natural and artificial ventilation, and innovative engineering solutions which collect and neutralise aerosols to provide clean air in personal and community spaces" (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3206">Wilson et al., 2020</a>).

<p><a href="https://mises.org/wire/almost-year-later-theres-still-no-evidence-showing-governments-can-control-spread-covid-19">Data from US</a> areas with widely different frequencies of mask wearing do not support the idea that cloth masks are effective: e.g. <a href="https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/one-month-after-statewide-mask-mandate-california-daily-case-average">California</a> <em>versus</em> <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/arizona-most-anti-mask-state-sees-coronavirus-cases-fall-1519129">Arizona</a>, as of late July 2020.

In a interview from <a href="https://twitter.com/PhilipWatson_/status/1299850554320072706">29 August</a> he stated: "the high quality trial evidence for cloth masks suggest they <strong>increase</strong> your rate of reinfection".  </p>

<p>The Beijing Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has re-assessed the evidence and announced that wearing masks outdoors is <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/coronavirus-beijing-announces-wearing-masks-outdoors-not-necessary/articleshow/75787242.cms">not necessary</a>.

<li>
<p>Widespread use of cloth masks has been pushed by the media as a (putative) solution to a specific problem: the risk of asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19. We have recently learned that the problem is smaller than initially believed. The World Health Organization has acknowledged on 8 June that there is strong evidence from detailed contact tracing showing that asymptomatic transmission is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/06/08/asymptomatic-coronavirus-patients-arent-spreading-new-infections-who-says.html?__twitter_impression=true">possible, but rare</a>. Under pressure, it has backpedalled the acknowledgment <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/who-expert-backtracks-after-saying-asymptomatic-transmission-very-rare">one day later</a>, but the rabbit is out of the bag and independent peer-reviewed empirical research (see <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32513410/">here 1</a>, <a href="https://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/pdf/10.5858/arpa.2020-0255-LE">here 2</a>, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2671">here 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1046-6">here 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w">here 5</a>) supports the initial acknowledgment of inefficient asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission (R0 &lt;0.1, compared to R0 of 2-3 for symptomatic transmission; that's 20-30 times less!). Even if one believed that cloth masks work, a cost-benefit calculus of public health policy would still show that healthy/asymptomatic people need not wear them. If alive, Richard Feynman would probably say that addressing COVID-19 with cloth masks is a great illustration of <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm">cargo cult science</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the topic of masks has become <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3021/rr-0">morally-loaded</a> ("Do the decent thing, and wear a mask"; "Be a good human and protect the vulnerable"), we must <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103120304248">be aware</a> of people's tendency to "<a href="https://reason.com/2020/07/22/when-choosing-what-to-believe-people-often-choose-morality-over-hard-evidence/">often choose morality over hard evidence</a>" and control for it. We need to look at the totality of available evidence, to see the <a href="https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2020&amp;issue=08000&amp;article=00001&amp;type=Fulltext&amp;cid=eTOC%20Issues.2020-ccmjournal-00003246-202008000-00000&amp;rid=V_0000000021198681">general patterns</a> that emerge, the outliers, and the <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2020/10/26/widely-cited-covid-19-masks-paper-under-scrutiny-for-inaccurate-stat/">variance</a> in the <a href="https://swprs.org/who-mask-study-seriously-flawed/">quality</a> of the <a href="https://metrics.stanford.edu/PNAS%20retraction%20request%20LoE%20061820">research designs</a> involved. We need to keep in mind Carnap and Hempel's total evidence rule, lest we jump to silly conclusions. We also need to keep in mind that because of mob pressure, there is an <a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/november-2020/welcome-to-covidworld/">asymmetry</a> as to which science gets publicized and which science gets banned and overlooked. We know that researchers like  Michael Osterholm who expressed reservations about masks have been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-science-of-mask-wearing-hasnt-changed-so-why-have-our-expectations/">harassed by the pro-mask crowd</a>. The science one gets to see these days on social media is the science approved by the mob - there are <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID/comments/imi0zm/a_worrying_trend_in_the_production_of_scientific/">very clear</a> signs of <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/temporary-coronavirus-censorship">pervasive COVID-19 related censorship</a>, including the <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/09/23/is-evidence-masks-dont-work-being-purged-from-the-internet/">purging of sites</a> that showed evidence that masks are ineffective. </p>

        <p>If you look at the numbers for most states, masks do not slow the spread of the virus. There is a more compelling case that masks actually speed up the spread. Just look at Florida. While no statewide mask mandate, most of the largest cities (Miami, Tampa, Orlando, etc) imposed mask mandates mid june. And then for the next month, cases skyrocketed until they peaked mid July. If mask wearing had even some impact, you would at least expect a less dramatic increase, but there was no flattening whatsoever. Same thing happened in Texas. Same thing happened in California. It's crazy that people can claim that masks are effective, when pretty much all real world evidence says otherwise.</p>

        <p>How American of you to list only sources from the US and claim that it is "all real world evidence." New Zealand has had incredible success against the pandemic, and masks have been part of their strategy.</p>

        <p>New Zealand is your example? A tiny, sparsely populated isolated, island nation, that completely has completely shut down all international since March, and has basically put its citizens under house arrest during that time? This is what you consider success? You can't possibly think that this is a sustainable strategy that can other countries can adopt? Good grief. </p>
<p>How about these non-american examples:</p>

<p>The list goes on and on. At some point you will have to admit that masks have no measurable impact on the spread of Sars-Cov-2. Nearly all the data shows this, whether you you look at states in the US or nations around the world. And this matches up with most of the scientific literature on the subject. <a href="https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy">Here</a> are some examples of many of the studies showing that masks don't work. And <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20200911-sweden-s-chief-epidemiologist-we-are-happy-with-our-strategy-on-covid-19">here</a> is a video of Sweden's chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell talking about their strategy and about how masks are not effective.  I find it so strange that people feel the need to defend a policy that has such weak supporting evidence. The knots some people will twist themselves into to believe that masks work. It's fascinating.</p>

<p>He has studies with hamsters in a cage. I kid you not. </p>

<p>'Put on the damn mask' </p>
<p>'Wear your mask, stay protected' </p>
<p>'Masks save lives' </p>
<p>Etc etc </p>

<p>Face diapers are ridiculous and it's nonsense that in spite of all the evidence that's not acknowledged as fact. There's a reason we frantically try to get our kids out of diapers, holding in the 'soils' is actually not the ideal.</p>

The Danish study had received criticism for this, as it only focused on prevention of the mask user <em>becoming</em> infected.</p>

        <p>Masking may prove ineffective but it is not an unreasonable measure on a new virus to take if a significant proportion of doctors think they work.</p>
<p>Some references, such as the "Universal Masking in Hospitals in the Covid-19 Era" (Drs. Klompas et al) cited in the post, have been misrepresented anti-maskers. Here is an excerpt from an interview with the authors in USA Today:</p>
<p>"We understand that some people are citing our perspective article as support for discrediting widespread masking. In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less." -- Drs. Michael Klompas, Charles Morris and Erica Shenoy, USA Today, July 22, 2020</p>

        <p>The idea behind masks isn't ridiculous, but at this point we have plenty of real world evidence that shows that mask wearing has little to no impact on the spread of this disease. Masks didn't slow the spread in California. They didn't slow the spread in Florida. They didn't slow the spread in Texas. They didn't slow the spread in Spain. Almost every place that has implemented mask mandates has not seen a decrease in the number of cases. People keep pointing to random studies trying to prove that masks work or don't work. This made sense in April. But we're in September now, and in the real world where actual places have had mask mandates for months, the numbers simply don't support the idea that masks are an effective method at slowing the spread of this virus. Where have mask mandates been effective?</p>

        <p>Why would masks spread the disease faster? There is already a history of pandemics and masks to draw on. The only argument I've heard about harm is psychological: "I'm wearing a mask so I don't have to observe any other measure."</p>

        <p>Just because masks were used in previous pandemics doesn't mean they were effective. If you've ever been around anyone with a mask or if you're going to be in the next couple of days just take note of how they put it on and take it off,  touch it repeatedly with their hands as they adjust it up and down depending on their activity. I don't have a study to link to but I can guarantee you that people wear the same masks too often, where them wrong, and touch their mask and their faces repeatedly thereby passing on the virus more easily.</p>

        <p>It’s good to actually link your source - <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2020836?query=recirc_curatedRelated_article">here is the actual follow up letter by the authors. </a></p>
<p>Also, for accuracy, please note that the quote you’ve provided is not from “an interview” with USA Today - it is a quote from the statement I’ve linked above. </p>
<p>But to the point, the original article was about the specific issue of <strong>universal masking in hospitals.</strong> In hospitals, by healthcare workers. It did not address “widespread masking” by the general population at all, other than to acknowledge that </p>
<p>&rt; We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. </p>
<p>They concluded that universal masking in hospitals was a good idea (despite explicitly acknowledging the weak evidentiary basis for it). </p>
<p>I don’t care what their intent in writing that article was, nor should you: the arguments and evidence stand or fall on their own. That original article did NOT support “more masking” outside of hospitals, but rather the exact opposite.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the full letter, Echo. That makes more sense, but "sustained interactions within closed environments" applies to public situations. On that basis I'm not surprised with a lack of correlation with mask mandates: people may mask on the street, where the authors say they aren't needed, but they do not wear them in bars, exactly where they are needed. Imagine loud arguments about games at sports bars, or patrons shouting over a loud performer (judging from a nearby pub, covid hasn't reduced the decibels)! Mask wearing is not a "cargo cult" because curbing droplets is a reasonable thing to do. It seems to me that masks should work but they are not used properly.</p>
