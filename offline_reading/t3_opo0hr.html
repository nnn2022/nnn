    <strong>So the "RN's" keep posting the copy paste "their loved one died and I encouraged them to get the Vax post."</strong>
    <p><p>Let's discuss this,</p>
<p>The RN taking you in to the ER starts checking you in</p>
<p>These people literally hold your life in their hands. They then find out you haven't taken the shot even though they were forced to in order to keep their job.</p>
<p>Do you truly think they don't just decide that you are basically dead at this point?</p>
<p>Anyone care to answer the amount of maintenance an intubator needs? Regular sanitation? I know they don't just hook you to a machine and it keeps you alive and breathing perfectly fine without needing to be serviced.</p>
<p>So the RN just decides to accidentally forget to service your intubator for a day or 2 and BAM you have this crazy lung infection and your dead.</p></p>

        <p>I remember at very beginning of this there was a popular comment saying everyone needs to lie about how many people they know who have died from covid.  Still zero for me and I swear upon all that is holy to be true.</p>

        <p>I don't know anyone. I know of two who died that were friends or relatives of friends. </p>
<p>I know of 4 severe cases that required hospitalization. Three are known personally and 1 relative of a friend. </p>
<p>All the deaths or hospitalized cases were men over age 70, all were diabetic, plus other various chronic health conditions. </p>
<p>And then i probably know of 50ish people who tested positive, the course of their illnesses varied widely, but all made full recoveries. </p>
<p>And most interestingly, I know of many people who had contact with the 50 or so cases, often extended direct contact, who not only never tested positive, never were found to have antibodies, which does not fit the narrative at all of just how contagious it is.</p>

        <p>This post confuses me. 
As an unvaxxed healthcare worker, I love it when I meet patients that have made their own decisions and have not been bullied, either way. If they are all excited about getting vaxxed, their peace of mind is my peace of mind. If they are 100% against getting it, im proud of them for standing for what they believe in.</p>
<p>I suspect it will become mandatory for employees at my hospital soon. I may be forced to get it because i have an amazing job and I need the money. </p>
<p>But I would never begrudge the unvaxxed patients simply because my situation required me to get it. I would secretly be proud of them and happy that they weren't forced into it.</p>

        <p>No. This is fairly ridiculous. I am a respiratory therapist. I work with ventilators, not intubators. The intubator would be the individual who inserts the endotracheal tube. Anyway, running a ventilator is a 24/7 situation. The patient needs to be continuously monitored and the ventilator needs to be checked/adjusted every 2-4 hours. The patient needs to be suctioned, repositioned, and assessed frequently. It is very labor intensive. I know of no hospitals in the usa that would fit your example. We are going to treat people the same, no matter the situation. From where I sit, I think that maybe the vax is possibly working to some degree...at least here in the usa. By no means will I take the fucking thing, and I am prepared to be fired when the mandate the jab, and they will, soon. I believe the vaccine is going to play a roll in the coming covid 21 pandemic via immune enhanced infection, or viral escape. There is absolutely no question there is a massive scam taking place. Whether or not it's a depopulation plan, or simply to tighten controls over the population is yet to be seen</p>
