    <strong>How do I quietly protest?</strong>
    <p><p>I am in my first year of high school, and it’s going horribly. I have always been an A-B student, but learning online this year totally tossed me off the bridge. I’m failing almost every class. I’ve tried to apply myself, I’ve tried to get used to it, but I just can’t learn this way. I had my first “full” week of school last week, and I couldn’t even finish it. I broke down on Thursday, I just didn’t want to be around people. I had to have an appointment with my therapist that day as my mom was nervous for me. This year I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and I’ve had to take medication that isn’t working. My depression is unbearable, I feel like I can’t get out of bed somedays. My social anxiety makes me get pangs of adrenaline every time I walk in the halls. I’ve been away from people my age for more than a year, and I don’t have any friends my age. I have been bombarded by politics, covid, and mental health; it’s like a Boulder just slowly pushing me into quicksand. My mom and other moms went to a meeting with the board of education director. I saw this as my opportunity to actually say something to somebody that can make a change, and so I stayed up two days writing a paper on how covid isn’t bad, and we should be able to go back in person. He said he would read it, but I’m pretty sure he just put it in his other pile of papers to “read later”.</p>
<p>So, I’ve tried a lot to get my “voice heard” and it hasn’t worked. I’ve thought of putting papers on the wall to ask other students how they are doing, or put graphs for the statistics side of covid. I’ve also gotten to the point of just going to the capital and protesting there, as my governor has no idea what she is doing. So, I wanted to know if there was a way I could protest(without getting me kicked out of school, such as not wearing a mask)but maybe slipping it down my nose in the halls with no people. I’m sick of having my education and mental health taken from me, and I want to have a say about it.</p></p>

        <p>You’re in high school bud. Don’t put all of the weight in your shoulders to fix the problems of the system. We appreciate your willingness to be a voice and a change, but don’t let it consume you and your well-being. Take care of yourself first. </p>
<p>Focus on the positives more than the negatives. It seems you are bombarded with things all of the time because you are letting yourself. Take a step away from the politics and the news and be a kid again. Be yourself as you would be if none of this were going on. That’s the best way you can quietly protest and bring normalcy back— act normal.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it’s really hard. I just feel like I’m sinking. I’ve tried to get away from all of it, but it’s just eaten me too much. Everywhere I go I have to wear a mask, and I’m just tired of nobody seeing the truth behind covid. I wish I could just get away, but the stress of it always comes back. But I guess I can always have dance parties when I’m home alone.</p>

        <p>You need to find friends who are of the same mindset.  The most important coping mechanism has been taken from you: socialization.  Be with people, touch them, hug them, smile.  This is what you need to focus on finding.</p>

        <p>Try going for walks in the trees.   Trees actually emit chemicals that boost mood. </p>
<p>A hobby that requires your hands - such as word working, model building, painting - things like that.   Maybe get an old car to fix up.</p>
<p>Finding like minded people around your age is a great suggestion too.   They are out there.  </p>
<p>Hang in there.  High School goes by pretty quickly.</p>

        <p>That's pretty brilliant tbh. Take an issue, create memes about it. It raises awareness it's also a non threatening way to disclose info.</p>

        <p>I'm confused what covid is doing here: you said you can't learn this way but also that you can't be around people? Wouldn't then going back to school normally again solve nothing for you since that's around loads of people?</p>
