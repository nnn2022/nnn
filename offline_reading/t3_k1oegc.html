<p>Do you have more details on that they you're willing and able to share?!</p>
<p>And is Wolfgang Wodarg getting the same treatment? </p>
<p>Or is it just Bhakdi?!</p>
<p>I noticed that both men make more or less the same arguments...</p>

        <p>They are both banned from intellectual discussions, openly being called conspiracy theorist and worse (nazi sympathy) you cant mention their names without getting a Look of disapointment :D it's so crazy cause wodarg was member of our labour party here and a scientist but now he's nothing, just crazy. Drosten and him are like antigonist and superhero cause they both know each other and despise each other since the swine flu in the early 2000</p>

<p>Nazi sympathies? </p>
<p>I can imagine them trying to do with with Wodarg, as ridiculous at it sounds. </p>
<p>But Bhakdi? A guy of Thai descent? How can anyone make sure a claim with a straight face?!</p>

<p>&rt; Drosten and him are like antigonist and superhero cause they both know each other and despise each other since the swine flu in the early 2000 </p>
<p>It's interesting how every country seems to have it's own Drosten. In the UK, it's a man called Neil Ferguson. In the Netherlands, it's a man called Ab Osterhaus. etc.</p>
<p>Like Drosten, these other expects have been making fake predictions in 2009, trying to create panic. Just like Drosten convinced Germany to buy millions of swine flu vaccines that ended up getting destroyed, Osterhaus did the same in the Netherlands... with the same result.</p>
<p>Yet, somehow, these same discredited experts manage to take the stage yet again, spreading panic about a fake pandemic, and somehow the real expects get branded as "conspiracy theorists".</p>
<p>You can't make this shit up. If this was a Hollywood movie, no one would deem it credible;..</p>

<p>Rn we have a movement here called the "querdenker" which are against the lockdown restrictions &amp; are organising some demonstrations nationwide. Nowadays, it doesn't matter if you say "you're a querdenker" or "you're a nazi" it's now the same, and querdenker is only a "nazi light" insult. So Bhakdi is linked to them and they're saying he is fueling their rage with his "so called studies &amp; expertise".  They wouldn't dare to call him a Nazi, so they find another perfect fitting, discrediting term. It's all part of the propaganda.</p>

<p>I thought nazis have always been associated with totalitarianism in post-war Germany.</p>
<p>How did nazis become associated with opponents of totalitarianism?</p>
<p>And does your average German actually buy into this obvious nonsense?</p>

<p>Are you familiar with <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/videos.html">Event 201</a>? </p>
<p>They actually discussed during that event (back in October 2019!) how to control the flow of information in case of a global pandemic. And the methods discussed during that "exercise" are the methods we are witnessing today.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; wE aRe ThE CoNsPiRaCy FrEaKs, damn </p>
<p>J wonder how long it will take before the masses figure out that "conspiracy theorists" have been right all along.</p>
<p>I mean... How long can you convince people that "The Great Reset" is "just a crazy conspiracy theory" when even the British Royal familiy openly markets this agenda <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRPQqfwwuhU">on their official YouTube channel</a>?!</p>
<p>I know the masses are gullible and haven't reached nearly the tipping point yet. But there must be some point where the nonsense becomes to transparent even the most gullible sheeple start sensing that something's not right.</p>
<p>Right?!</p>

<p>You mean 2018? </p>
<p>You are refering to Clade X, right?</p>
<p>As with Event 201, you can actually find a multi-part overview of everything discussed during the event in video format <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ1x8SlNxj0">here on Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>I remember watching these segments months ago, along with those of Event 201... or at least listening to them in the background while I was doing other stuff.</p>
<p>I think it's time to put them on again, considering how much has changed since then...</p>

        <p>The book mentions a leaked document:</p>
<p>&rt; It came to light in May, when a previously confidential document appeared on the website of the German Ministry of the Interior(154). The shocking contents confirmed circulating rumours. The document, dating to mid-March, was the minutes of a meeting of the coronavirus task-force. There, one was astounded to learn that fear-mongering was the official agenda created to manage the epidemic. All the pieces of the puzzle then fell into place. Everything had been planned. The high numbers of infection were purposely reported because the numbers of deaths would “sound too trivial”. The central goal was to achieve a massive shock effect. Three examples are given how to stir up primal fears in the general population:</p>
<p>&rt; 1) People should be scared by a detailed description of dying from COVID-19 as “slow drowning”. Imagining death through excruciating slow suffocation incites the most dread.</p>
<p>&rt; 2) People should be told that children were a dangerous source of infection because they would unwittingly carry the deadly virus and kill their parents.</p>
<p>&rt; 3 ) Warnings about alarming late consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infections were to be scattered. Even though not formally proven to exist, they would frighten people. Altogether, this strategy would enable all intended measures to be implemented with general acceptance by the public.</p>

        <p>I think this is the correct link for that document :</p>

<p>The text translates as follows :</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>How we get COVID-19 under control</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>1. Location and strategy</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The pandemic COVID-19 virus is for the politics, society and the economy in Germany and Europe the greatest challenge since the end of World War II. A look at the data from Asia and the reports from neighboring European countries show that an <strong>underestimation the magnitude of this challenge will lead to immense, irreversible damage</strong>.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Most virologists, epidemiologists, medical professionals, economists and political scientists answer the question “what happens if nothing is done” with a worst-case scenario of over one Million deaths in 2020 - for Germany alone. A team of experts from RKI, RWI, IW, SWP, University of Bonn / University of Nottingham Ningbo China, University of Lausanne and University of Kassel confirms these figures with an overall model developed for Germany.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>Avoiding this worst case therefore has top strategic priority</strong> and is after the Calculations and recommendations by this team of experts are not only absolutely necessary, but also still possible.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;What should I do?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>1) Communication:</strong> The worst case and all the consequences for the population in Germany must be made clear, decisive and transparent.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>2) Unity:</strong> Avoiding the worst case is to be defined as a central political and social goal. Politicians and citizens must act as a unit.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>3) Traceability:</strong> The citizens must be able to understand that the following measures must and can only be implemented for their benefit with their help.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;a. Social contacts are to be reduced to a minimum for a certain period of time (social Distancing) and an end to these measures <strong>must be made dependent on the comprehensible public impact of these measures</strong>.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;b. The effect of the measures can best be seen <strong>by extending the testing</strong> for make all citizens comprehensible in real time (?). Citizens with suspicion of infection and the entire circle of contact persons of positive tested citizens should be tested consistently. Large-scale testing enables the citizens affected by exit restrictions <strong>to act actively in crisis situations</strong>. We have to go from the Method «We test to confirm the situation» to the method «We test to before the situation to come » (South Korea proves this method workd very well). A central one Recording of all tests carried out and in the future is essential. A <strong>Determination of the national test capacity</strong> (capacities for tests, medical staff for Implementation, evaluation) and their greatest possible <strong>increase are overdue</strong>. This allows a shared observation of the spread and containment with all citizens. This allows for a step-by-step intervention in economic and social processes and the <strong>acceptance and meaningfulness of freedom-restricting measures</strong>.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;c. Even with successful containment of the epidemic, <strong>the capacity for the necessary medical care will be increased</strong>. The situation will get worse that not only intensive medical care for the seriously ill with ventilators, but also an oxygen supply for the moderately ill outpatient and inpatient will be necessary (China proves this).<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;d. The <strong>federal government must start a comprehensive mobilization campaign</strong>. The current crisis from COVID-19 is a hard blow to trust in institutions. This has to be counteracted because the government has to become a mobilizing factor. Motto: «Something very threatening is about to hit us to, but we have recognized the danger and act decisively and deliberately. We need all forces in society to come together and work. Then we will still avert the danger ». <strong>In order to mobilize societal perseverance</strong>, hiding the worst case is not an option. If you want to avert danger, you have to know the worst case scenario.</p>
<p>Note that this is a machine translation. I tried to correct some of the most blatant errors, but I'm sure I missed a few. It's almost 4am over here as I'm typing this, and neither German nor English are my native tongue.</p>
<p>If this is in fact the document Bhakdi was refering to, he did seem to have misrepresented its content, as I can not find any mention of children or "slow drowning".</p>
<p>Anyway, here's an English translation of <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/presse/hib/705000-705000">the official statement</a> of the German government on a leaked document with the same title :</p>
<p>&rt;Berlin: (hib / STO) On a "scenario paper" with the title "How we get Covid-19 under control", the Federal Government comments in its answer (19/20301) to a small question from the AfD parliamentary group (19/19742) . The paper was then sent to the Committee for Home Affairs and Home Affairs on April 8 and subsequently published on the website of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Home Affairs (BMI). According to the information, it was developed "from a technical dialogue between the Federal Ministry of the Interior and various scientists" and was initiated by the scientists. According to the submission, it is "one of many scientific papers on the Covid 19 pandemic that the federal government has taken note of but not adopted".<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;As the Federal Government further explains, a scenario paper describes "the nature of scenarios that are possible and technically justifiable on the basis of facts and contains neither evaluations nor recommendations". At the same time, the Federal Government points out that it is in constant communication with scientists and scientific institutions on the consequences of the Covid 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>They don't really address the content of the document, however they do mention the BMI as the source, which does suggest it's the same document.</p>
<p>I would find it surprising, though, that Bhakdi would misrepresent a document that can one can easily search and translate through Google. That seems very, very sloppy to me.</p>
<p>Where did the link to the document? What makes you believe that this is the document Bhakdi was refering to in this book?</p>

        <p>Thanks for doing that. Same time here so briefly... That is the source he actually linked to in the book, it's in an index at the back. Your link is just shorter and has a 6 at the end instead of a 4.</p>
<p>I don't know why it's different as I'm not German. It could be down to Bhakdi's incorrect statement, or the officials could have modified or updated it. Maybe someone native has more information.</p>

        <p>Wtf that's insanity at best here... next you know David Icke's new book will no longer be on amazon either... I did read the book from Bhakdi and highly suggest that others read it too!</p>

        <p>I haven't checked Icke's book yet, but it definitely wasn't just Bhakdi's book that got purged.</p>
<p>The also removed Kollerstrom's <a href="https://www.booktopia.com.au/the-great-british-coronavirus-hoax-nicholas-kollerstrom/book/9781916182158.html">The Great British Coronavirus Hoax</a>.</p>
<p>Kollerstrom's book isn't nearly the same quality as Bhakdi's, though, and does enter a bit too far into tin foil hat territory to be considered a credible source. But it's still worth checking out, as it does contain lots of useful info.</p>

        <p>Your welcome.</p>
<p>If you're genuinely interested in buying the book, make sure to get it ASAP. Since the books has already been removed from both Amazon &amp; Bookdepository, it's likely to get purged from other online resellers in the very near future as well.</p>

        <p>Those who buy into the Covid-19 hysteria probably support banning books like these.</p>
<p>They have become so conditioned to consider any source actually telling the truth aboit the Covid-19 scam "fake news" and so conditioned to think of such "fake news" as very dangerous, they are likely to applaud any censurship of the truth.</p>

        <p>I've had a bit of a skim through it before. It mentions a leaked document:</p>
<p>&rt; It came to light in May, when a previously confidential document appeared on the website of the German Ministry of the Interior(154). The shocking contents confirmed circulating rumours. The document, dating to mid-March, was the minutes of a meeting of the coronavirus task-force. There, one was astounded to learn that fear-mongering was the official agenda created to manage the epidemic. All the pieces of the puzzle then fell into place. Everything had been planned. The high numbers of infection were purposely reported because the numbers of deaths would “sound too trivial”. The central goal was to achieve a massive shock effect. Three examples are given how to stir up primal fears in the general population:
&rt; 1) People should be scared by a detailed description of dying from COVID-19 as “slow drowning”. Imagining death through excruciating slow suffocation incites the most dread.
&rt; 2) People should be told that children were a dangerous source of infection because they would unwittingly carry the deadly virus and kill their parents
&rt; 3) Warnings about alarming late consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infections were to be scattered. Even though not formally proven to exist, they would frighten people.
Altogether, this strategy would enable all intended measures to be implemented with general acceptance by the public.</p>
<p>I wonder if that was real/confirmed or fake? Not German so I don't know what goes on there.</p>
