        <p>Looks like Patrick King totally embellished his side of the story. Deena Hinshaw did not admit to not having evidence of an isolated Sars-COV-2 virus at all, as King had claimed. The story was too good to be true. Oh well.</p>

        <p>Hi everyone, I think I commented on this sub, as well as similar, in response to the reaction to the Patrick King case. A very quick summary is that Patrick King subpoenaed our CMO, Dina Hinshaw, requesting evidence of an isolated COVID-19 sample, after he was heard on the matter of the ticket issued to him under the Public Health Act.</p>
<p>When this was not produced, King took this as a win for his own matter (the bylaw ticket being issued), as well as spun it as proof that COVID does not exist, as well as speculated that this is why further restrictions are being lifted in Alberta on August 16th.</p>
<p>I replied to a few people outlining that what likely happened was that the Crown saw this as a waste of time, were ready to drop the matter at hand, but allowed him to issue the subpoena, as is his right. The statement a lot of people were hung up on is that it came back that Hinshaw/AHS/GOA has 'no material evidence' pertaining to the matter at hand. I tried my best explaining what this meant in legalese.</p>
<p>Someone in the original King thread posted a link to all relevant legal documents, so I figured I would read through them and see if I was on the money as far as what had actually transpired.</p>
<p>I have posted what I think is the most important piece of that documentation, which supports what I had assumed. I hope that in the interest of skepticism, questioning and debate, people can read this and see that King is either intentionally, or unintentionally misleading people.</p>
<p>I honestly think it was unintentional on his part, that he really does see himself as a freedom fighter crushing the government here, but in reality he is someone who wasted his own and the courts time. He was a guy fighting a Public Health Act ticket, turned into hype, and fell flat on his face due to not understanding whatsoever what legal process he was engaging in.</p>
<p>Read the court transcripts (linked in original King thread, and/or on a website called www.redvoicemedia.com ), and tell me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
