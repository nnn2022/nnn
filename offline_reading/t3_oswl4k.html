    <strong>If it wasn't for this constant fear-pushing, no one would notice a damn thing.</strong>
    <p><p>Okay, that's obvious. But seriously. The vast majority of people die with it, not from it. And the ones who do die from it were already on death's door to begin with. Maybe if they didn't get the virus, they would have lived another month or two. Even then, what quality of life would they have at that point? They could die just as easily from pneumonia or a bad flu. But no one cares about that. People aren't paranoid about that. You don't see people forcing their paranoia onto you because of that. All they care about is THIS virus. They don't care about the old people who can't get treatment because of "covid rules." They never gave one shit about old people before now. And you know what you can do to decrease your chances from death if you get it? LIVE A FREAKING HEALTHY LIFE. Even if you do have "underlying conditions" and you're older, you have a very high chance of survival still.</p>
<p>Also, you know how the flu magically disappeared? You can bet lots of older people who died with "covid" actually had the flu or some other illness, since those tests for the virus are suuuuuper accurate. That's not a conspiracy theory. It's just an obvious conclusion to make.</p>
<p>"But isn't it hard not to notice millions of people dying?!?!?!?!?!"</p>
<p>Millions of people die every day. That's nothing new. Most people don't even have so much as an acquaintance that died from it. I know I don't. If this virus was an actual pandemic, wouldn't many people at least know of someone that died from it? And even then, again, how many people who "died from it" actually died from it? Or did they die from something else? Or were they just close to death to begin with?</p>
<p>And the reason it sounds so scary is because of the daily death counts. If you saw a daily death count for car accidents, driving would seem scary. If you saw a daily death count for other illnesses, it would make those terrifying as well. But haven't we had viruses in the past years with similar death counts and no one batted an eye? Y'know, because the fear and death count wasn't shoved down your throat every day? I don't exactly know details about that, so correct me if I'm wrong and please give me some information on that if you have any, but I seem to remember there being outbreaks which had similar death tolls. And again, there are plenty of deaths marked covid that obviously aren't. But if so, that just proves that you <em>wouldn't</em>  notice without the fear propaganda, because you didn't before.</p>
<p>I have fucking had it. I am sick and tired of older people telling me that the only reason I think this is because I'm young. First of all, people my age are pushing this fear even harder than the older generations, and I have virtually no friends my age who agree with me on this, so it's not that. Second of all, if I was old, at risk of this, if this virus was as bad as they say and even worse, I still would NEVER think that it would in any way warrant people changing the way they live their lives, especially this much and for this long. I would NEVER ask young people to waste away in their homes in what is supposed to be the time of their lives, that's for certain. I'm not "just saying that now because I'm young."</p>
<p>It is the most selfish thing, expecting the young to give up so much for this, especially with as little risk as there actually is.</p></p>
