        <p>Totally believe it. My wife used to work for a hospital group that treated medicare like a cash pinata and would run unnecessary tests and straight up lie about the necessity of certain procedures just so they could get more from Medicare. </p>
<p>My wife ended up quitting after seeing just how corrupt hospital admins can be when it comes to sucking more money out of the government.</p>

        <p>I mean you can label anyone as a covid death since they don’t care about died from or died with distinction. Sounds pretty lucrative if you ask me. Whole medical and pharmaceutical system is a scam.</p>

        <p>It definitely says only some states have the presumed positive and they have to have Medicare and  n o  fraudulent reporting of cases found 
You can break that down and do the research and look at all the states but I believe it’s a smaller number that most people on this sub think</p>

        <p>That’s actually incorrect. Covid tests are roughly 80% accurate, and there’s the possibility of people getting multiple positive tests counting as multiple Covid cases.</p>

        <p>Have a friend here in Texas whose entire family moved from Buenos Aires 3 years ago. He is becoming increasingly despondent and every time we hang out he looks worse and worse because he said family back home are all becoming seriously depressed and suicidal. </p>
<p>Their society is shattered. They have soaring unemployment, peoples savings have run out and you can barely leave your home. You're basically locked inside your apartment... and most Argentinians live in small cramped apartments. He actually started to cry when we were last talking because he was saying that on TV there was a program that told children not to sing in their own homes because it could spread the virus and the government told people not to share mate (their traditional tea) with family members. He said, "My government won't even let us share mate... for us that is like telling us that you cannot be a human." </p>
<p>Argentina will never recover from this in our lifetimes.</p>

        <p>Personally I think there is far more at work than a virus. The pattern in the outbreaks from day 1 suggests that these outbreaks are more of  deliberate fabrication rather than following the inherent rules of viral propagation. If the virus is as infectious and virulent as they claimed and behaved as such, the entire east coast of Asia would have been a graveyard before any measures were taken and by the end of May virtually every person in the world would have been exposed to some degree..</p>
<p>It appears the recent outbreaks are definitely vaccine driven so they can have a constant flow of subjects to experiment on. I am also confident that this vaccine will be accompanied by a nefarious agenda and not be limited to the prevention of any virus COVID or otherwise.</p>

        <p>this is what you said</p>
<p>&rt;Operative word is current death rate. It's been the daily death leader since late September based on the linked chart.</p>
<p>If you actually look at the data, we've been right on track with Argentina since September. So their strict lockdown didn't work, our do whatever the fuck you want policies didn't work....</p>

        <p>If you want to just talk about if lock downs work and ignore everything else (economy, societal impacts) yes they work if done correctly. The point of a lockdown is to drastically slow the spread of a fast moving virus so as to not overwhelm the hospital systems and reduce infection rate to hopefully not allow spread to continue or stop it all together. 
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-europe-lockdown-effectiveness-graphics/">Look at the early stats</a></p>
<p>But did countries implement lock downs quick enough so that they were effective? Some did, some didn't. An interesting, theoretical not peer reviewed study, was done on the most effective way to lock down if needed. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26981">you can read it here</a>. It does ignore economic impact and states that. </p>
<p>The point of that study seems to show that it's about timing. <a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/do-lockdowns-actually-work">Here is an interesting short article that links to some studies on early lock downs and their effects.</a>  </p>
<p>Looking at Argentina, between July 18 and August 2 was the easing of those restrictions. On July 21st Argentina saw 5,344 new cases. It seems like the strict lock down followed by a easing of those restrictions resulted in a spike. Likely due to the fatigue people felt from lock downs and the desire to get back to normal social interactions, 
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/coronavirus-argentina-million-quarantine-lockdown/2020/10/26/65eefde2-149c-11eb-bc10-40b25382f1be_story.html">which seems to be the case</a></p>
<p>Socially and economically speaking, Argentina had problems before this. The government is ignoring the economic impact of their lock down strategy resulting in protests since July, or mass gatherings. That's probably a contributing factor as well in the past 30 days. </p>
<p>I'm still not sure where you're getting that they had the most deaths since September. They had the biggest increase percentage because it wasn't that high prior to September. </p>
<p>Covid deaths in Argentina from September 4th to October 30th - +21,287  </p>
<p>Covid deaths in the United States from September 4th to October 30th- +41,871   </p>
<p>You can get that data here: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths</p>

        <p>Of course. I was interested because I didn't know much about Argentina's covid response. If it still spread under lock down, then that's interesting. But when you look deeper, you realize why they had a sudden spike. The downvotes don't bother me. If someone wants to engage and have an intellectually honest conversation, then great. I know I'm not going to change someone's mind that only wants to see and hear what they want to believe. I love being proven wrong, it changes my perspective and helps me to understand the impact of this pandemic.</p>
