    <strong>In regards to the shaking.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m not here to say that any of the videos of convulsions are true or false. I’m just here to give perspective on what it’s like to lose control of a part of your body.</p>
<p>A few years back I was in college and I was under a lot of stress. I was working 40 hours a week with 4 college classes, while paying 6-700 dollars a month.</p>
<p>It began with a shake in my wrist, a small one. It would happen randomly Tourette’s-like where it would just bounce my arm, it was annoying, but wasn’t awful or painful, it was like a reaction to someone tickling you where you just kind of react. It eventually stopped in my arm and for whatever reason worked it’s way up to my neck. This happened whenever I was trying to relax. I’d work a full shift at my job and get home where I’d sit on the couch, and all of a sudden my head was twisting back and forth, very slight, like a vibration. I dealt with this for months before I couldn’t control my neck in front of my parents for a family gathering. That’s not what this post is about.</p>
<p>The way it feels to not have control over your own body is one of the scariest things I have ever experienced in my 23 years of living. It wears you down, the muscles are contracting and using energy that you have no business expending at that time. You are up late into the night because your body can’t rest. It doesn’t look like it’s real because you have small these beautiful small breaks where you can catch your breath and relax before it starts again and you lose control. I know that these videos are hard to watch and the number is so small compared to the amount of people who received the vaccine, but please refrain from communicating with these people. It looks fake, hell it might even be stress induced like mine possibly was and not related to the actual vaccine(I had a ton of brain scans and other tests done to me, doctors couldn’t find anything)</p>
<p>Please be kind to people, if it comes out as fake then fuck them, but don’t jump on people immediately, please.</p></p>

        <p>I can relate; since March 2020 I've had "brain zaps" and convulsions at random when I try to rest.  It feels like a lightning bolt hitting my brain and then my limbs will move involuntarily.  It scared my ex when we were still sharing a bed.</p>

        <p>There was a time when I would shake uncontrollably, because I had crazy temperatures from having cancer. Like I couldn't keep my legs down on the bed. No joke it's not pleasant, the worst thing was seeing how disturbing it was for family members to watch.</p>
