    <strong>Gaslighting and the consequences</strong>
    <p><p>https://youtu.be/BuSSuuUkrNI </p>
<p>Who can say which camp is gaslighting and which isn't?</p>
<p>Is there actually an objective way to assess all the facts, or is it all dependant on how you view the world?</p>
<p>Am I gaslighting right now?</p>
<p>Please share any and all opinions and views on this topic</p></p>

        <p>From the description of your video:</p>
<p>&rt; Many examples of gaslighting in relationships include lying to you, <strong>isolating you</strong>, or making you doubt or question yourself. </p>
<p>So here's one way you can tell right here. Look at how you're being treated and see if it matches the common hallmarks of gaslighting.</p>
<p>Want another? Start with some very simple facts which are hard to get wrong. Take excess death numbers for instance. It's a hard thing to fake. Then be very systematic in your thinking. See if it matches what you are being told.</p>
<p>For it to be justified that the most disruptive restrictions in our lives are being imposed on us the excess death numbers would have to be way higher than anything that we have ever seen in our lives. But is this true?</p>

        <p>I didn't exactly know where you were coming from when you asked your question, but now that you say this, I'll tell you what I tell other people who I know IRL when they wonder if they are going crazy.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this: what has done more damage to your life, lockdowns and all its trappings, or coronavirus? Then ask yourself this, why the hell should any other question matter?  It is not for anybody to tell you that your answer to this question is invalid.</p>
