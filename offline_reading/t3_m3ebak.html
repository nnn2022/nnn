    <strong>Sarah Everard and Covid freedom</strong>
    <p><p>Hello! Yes the title is a bit strange, but hear me out.</p>
<p>If you’ve been on the internet the last few days you will have heard and seen the horrific story of Sarah Everard, a young woman who was raped and killed while walking home. The reason for my post here today is in response to all the conversation surrounding women, the freedom to walk alone at night, women and the precautions we have to take to protect ourselves etc. There is currently a post on r/rant about how women should be able to walk alone at night and how we as women take a calculated risk leaving our home. Myself included I always look out for better ways to get home, avoiding certain places etc. And everyone seems OUTRAGED that there are people blaming the woman by saying - “ Shouldn’t have gone outside so late” , “She could have known better” etc etc... </p>
<p>They say women should be able to walk freely and not have to stay at home to avoid being raped. People even brought up news articles and personal stories of either themselves or other women they know that have been assaulted in public and broad daylight. It’s logical that we as women should be able to go where we choose. It’s a calculated risk but we take it because life goes on. </p>
<p>So how come in the past year I have not been able to work, meet my friends, go to a bar or travel? I’m getting social welfare that will screw me in the future because we
Will be paying for this tax for the next 100 years. I would much rather work than sit at home and watch the world burn itself. Why are people outraged for me to travel to another city because of this lockdown, but then they turn around and say women should be able to go wherever they please even if they know the risks. But don’t we as people get a choice to take the potential risk with covid, and those who are genuinely afraid just stay at home? I know the risks for me being a female in my late 20s. I am willing to take the risk with covid just like I am willing to take a risk walking down a dark street at night. (Though covid
Doesn’t scare me anywhere near as much as being raped/killed) </p>
<p>Do people not see the hypocrisy?</p></p>

        <p>Pls can someone link an article as I dont know everything about this case but I never found an article that has said that she has been raped. It is awful what happened and I have had many times been told to not go and walk streets alone dont go home drunk by self in taxi and many others but a freind has said to not make it political as that is not what she would of wanted.

        <p>What a thoroughly gross comparison. Using a dead, raped girl to make a point about your 'freedom to not wear a mask' is disgusting.</p>
