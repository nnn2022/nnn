    <strong>Feeling beat down...</strong>
    <p><p>Before all this I was used to being an outcast. Well, maybe not used to it, but I was able to at least get by with minimal grief from others by just keeping my mouth shut with most people and not sharing my radical ideas. I had accepted the fact that 99.9% of other people would disagree with me on a litany of subjects. But, I would still play their silly social games as to not completely alienante myself from my community. Humans need some semblance of belonging, after all.</p>
<p>In this brave new world, however, I am feeling myself crack at the seams from the shaming, condemnation and hatred aimed at myself and those who would dare question the narrative or, worse yet, not wear a mask. </p>
<p>I have a limit to the amount of irrational silliness I will act out in the name of social acceptance. Any self respecting human being must. My line in the sand has been reached. But I find the price to pay for my non compliance - the contempt and outright hatred, to be extraordinarly difficult to bear.</p></p>

        <p>I wonder how many of us are here on this sub because of lifelong isolation that has now peaked. The mask thing specifically makes me crazy because my whole adult life my sensitivities to commercial cleansers, artificial fragrances, and exhaust fumes trigger severe migraine. I could never walk down the soap aisle in a store like other people can. Instead of wearing a face diaper because I get headaches from them very very quickly, I  just quit shopping and eating out and having casual friends who have no idea how saturated they are with artificial fragrance in their hair, clothes, oozing out their pores. I was gifted with a phenomenal sense of smell that serves me wonderfully in the garden. I can identify plant terpenes with my nose just by crushing a leaf or sniffing some fresh roots. But in my culture, I am sprayed into a corner, and now my culture is dumping even more of their responsibility to keep the air clean on the breathers!!!</p>

        <p>Like....First she had surgery to remove my then-fetus husband and the giant tumor that kept him company from her uterus. Actually, I think they just took the whole uterus. Then she had gastric bypass surgery, which resulted in sepsis because she vacationed in hot humid Florida and went back to eating McDonald's that same month. She was in a coma for a few months, successfully lost a bunch of weight because she almost died, felt too skinny, and has since gained back much of that weight. Sometime along the way, she had surgery yet again to put in hernia mesh. Which got infected, removed, replaced with more mesh, infected again....</p>
<p>Now she has a bunch of scar tissue she wonders why the doctors can't just remove. And this MRSA-infected abscess that fills up every few months until it bursts through her old incisions, leaking all throughout the house. Oftentimes she doesn't even notice for a few weeks, accusing me of leaving menstrual blood on the toilet seat, and she may or may not have yet another useless surgery when she does finally notice. And these festering incisions are mostly in her folds, so the smell is compounded. Some days are worse than others; I'll make dinner, walk past her, and lose my appetite. Sadly, she's a genuinely sweet old woman - though perhaps a bit too extraverted for my taste - and I really don't want her to know how disgusted I am sometimes. It would crush her, and there's no point in making her feel ashamed for something she can't help. That's part of why I try to remain as anonymous as possible online.</p>
<p>Sure I frequently seem angry at her, but I like to think of it more as anger ABOUT her. Though I understand why the difference is ultimately a moot point. Sometimes I just get tired of trying to sneak around and clean up after her though lol</p>

        <p>Pretty sure she has C Diff too. I'm much more afraid of that and MRSA than I am of COVID, mainly because I don't want to smell like that. I actually have nightmares about it. That's why it bugs me so much that disinfectant wipes are so rare now, I need those to wipe off the toilet seat.</p>

        <p>I gave up on cleaning and started focusing on my T Cells, haha, back when I worked on dairy farms and usually got tails of shit slapped across my front teeth while trying to attach the milking machines. </p>
<p>I was a classroom teacher for a long time, too, the last four years where dengue fever and hanta virus and plague were happening on the border of West TX and Mexico. No problem for me, not even colds. My students all had hanky sleeves, you know the routine, but they never made me sick, just pukey because dirty boy tennis shoes. </p>
<p>I figure the other bacteria crawling all through my house because both my husband and I are slackers, will make short work of MRSA etc. The staph rash/boils I used to get at the nape of my neck finally totally cleared up after I stopped using shampoo and soap entirely, sooooo .... D3, zinc, magnesium, omega 3 and 9, E, C, boron, lemon balm, oregano, thyme, and Swedish saunas and plunge pools, Yada Yada:) i know YMMV, different history.</p>

        <p>Forgoing shampoo was the best thing ever for my hair and skin! I started puberty fairly early, got typical puberty zits and dandruff, so my neurotic neat-freak mother caked my face in makeup and bought all these special medicated soaps, shampoos, wipes, and creams. Only fucked me up even more. Got bullied if I wore my makeup, got bullied if I didn't, took me years to go from a thick layer of concealer every few hours at least to a few tiny dabs every few days at most. I would count the forced/coerced makeover from my mother-in-law when we first met as a form of bullying too, but she meant well. One of those "girl time!!!!" kind of ladies lol</p>
<p>Only time I really use soap is if I feel like whatever contaminant is much worse than whatever is in the soap, or as security theater when I handle food for others.</p>
<p>But MRSA and C Diff are just some of those things that really freak me out, even though I'm not really at risk. I think it's just because I see how my mother-in-law turned out, and I greatly fear becoming like her, my own mother, certain school bullies, etc. Hantavirus kinda worries me too, simply because I handle wild mice quite a bit. Though I have a hunch that it's another one of those overhyped viruses.</p>

        <p>Thank you, I love this. Yes, lots of things really are overhyped. Why don't they want to study those of us who naturally resist terribly dangerous infections? They know so little about naturally healthy people compared to say, treating drug side effects with more drugs. I started out life coming down with everything around. Still had issues in college. Missed lots of opportunities, but by then I had learned to knock out a cold by sunbathing! I moved south and spent most of my time outdoors. The next big miracle was quitting vegetarianism. Haven't had a cold since like 1997.</p>

        <p>Haha I'm not so sure I want to be studied, at least not with the way things are now....</p>
<p>Can't agree enough about sunlight! Anytime I get sick, I don't feel quite right until I manage to drag myself outside into the sun. Beef stew is a great medicine too.</p>
<p>Honestly, now that I think about it, the only virus I really really worry about is rabies. It's kind of a pet topic of mine; every so often, I'll spend hours scouring the web for hope regarding what seems to genuinely be one of the most fatal bugs to catch. I knew a girl who claimed to be naturally immune to rabies, but she said some pretty crazy stuff. Not that I'm one to talk!</p>
<p>You mentioned being in Texas? Where were you from originally, if you don't mind me asking?</p>

        <p>I grew up near NYC and schooled on Canadian border, then more school in TX in the sun for a change. Rabies is the worst. I wouldn't invite amoebas to feast on me either, so only salt water swimming for me. But hey, what if viruses attack bugs like rabies. They certainly have been acknowledged as bacterial scavengers.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, I totally forgot about amoebas! Thankfully amoeba infections seem fairly rare, and as with other pathogens, I can't help but wonder how many infections fly under the radar because they never get bad enough to be tested for. Same with rabies. For all we know, some people get nipped by rabid bats and turn out fine. Rather not risk it though.</p>
<p>Interesting article, especially in today's climate. I've read similar things about intestinal worms.</p>

        <p>Man they do love to spread misery.  I refused to wear a mask as a vendor in a Target store and the manager "had me removed" from the store (I voluntarily left, but since he was on a power trip that's how he described it).  If that wasn't enough he also made a point to complain about me to corporate and now I could lose my job over it.</p>

        <p>Yeah my answer to "But you could get someone else sick if you're asymptomatic" has now become "who gives a fuck." I started out with so much empathy, but they're destroyed that now. It's dark to admit this, but part of me WANTS millions to die now. I hate admitting that part of myself; I guess I'm so well and truly frustrated by all this totalitarian insanity. </p>

        <p>I still have empathy too—before all this, I spent a lot of time volunteering and trying to serve others, donating money to various causes, etc. Now? We’ve been forced to care about every single issue and every single problem that every single person has and it’s not sustainable. I am fatigued from caring.</p>

I definitely still care about people who treat me even slightly-decently - or at least just leave me alone. I care about everyone on this sub, my family, my friends, strangers who don't tell me to wear a mask, the elderly, the sick and the vulnerable.</p>
<p>I can't care about the pro-lockdown psychopaths, the fascist government "leaders", liars in the media, people who tell me to wear masks. </p>
<p>I dunno about you, but I'd just like to be left alone to live my own life. Whatever happened to "I won't try to run your life, and you don't try to run mine?"</p>

        <p>Doomers aren't immune from selfishness either. Ask them why they support lockdowns. "I don't want <em>myself/my family</em> to get sick." They don't really care about the casualties in Brazil or Italy or New York. People care about themselves and their close inner circle before anyone else. That's normal.</p>
<p>It just so happens that the people closest to me are more at risk of dying from suicide/relapses than they are of dying from COVID, so I want the lockdowns and social isolation to end to keep them safe. If that's what selfishness is, I'll admit to it.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of this is driven by older people who are convinced locking up school children and teenagers will somehow make them safer. They think the whole world has to shut down even if it only slightly decreases their chances of dying from the virus.</p>

        <p>I've starting sharing my opinions with less and less hesitation. Other people who wear masks often agree with me. You never know how many people are wearing masks out of obligation versus whether they are true believers. It's not as bad as you think - people are sick of these awful things.</p>

        <p>This. I'm trying not to judge people too harshly for complying, especially after several good conversations with masked individuals at Walmart and the vehicle emissions test facility. They laughed at the jokes I kept cracking about the stupid signs with stupid rules, one lady said we've probably already had the virus but didn't know it because we were more-or-less fine, and one man said they should at least provide an awning if they're gonna make us stand outside in the rain. Then another man took off his mask when he saw me not wearing one, agreed with my distaste for digital payment and how this is all just about control.</p>

        <p>And you never know who is under that mask until they speak up, a scared would-be dissenter or a crazed masketeer. It's especially hard for someone who already has trouble reading facial expressions. My mother-in-law keeps sharing these stories of telling people she's smiling under her mask, knowing they're smiling under their mask, because "You can see it in their eyes, y'know?" No, I can't. I can't tell if someone is smiling unless I actually see them smile. Only exception is maybe my husband, I gaze into his eyes enough to know what I'm seeing. Kinda.</p>

        <p>Hey...I'm feeling defeated too.</p>
<p>Personal interactions have ended up in fights because I am on this side. I get yelled at that I'm too stupid and too selfish, and it's because of people like me that this is getting worse.   </p>
<p>I can't even have rational conversations because I get shouted at so I am not allowed to talk, and anything I say is shut down.  Also, since I know someone who actually WAS sick from Covid, he just discounts any thought I have on the matter all the time.  (BTW He is excited for the vaccine and plans to be amongst the first to get it)</p>
<p>It's honestly feeling like it's time to give up. At least in America, this is it. </p>
<p>They are making us wait for a virus. <br>
They are fucking determined to do that, no matter what else it destroys in the process. <br>
People ACTUALLY believe that Covid is the deadliest and scariest thing in the world now.</p>
<p>I'm seeing my line in the sand too.<br>
I can't want to stay in a world that is going to mock my existence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately all those who love me, don't care that they are killing me with how they treat me on this. After all I'm part of the problem in this world...</p>

<p>Yeah me too. We'll be pariahs; who gives a shit. Nobody's jabbing me with a god damn needle. I'll fight to the death on that (literally - I'm willing to die over it). And if they make it" mandatory by coercion" (as in, you can't live in society without having being vaccinated) ill move to a more rural town.</p>

        <p>I can relate. I have usually been the most "out there" person in most groups I find myself in. And, yes, it's bad now. I am embracing it, though. This year has made me see a lot more clearly how fake and manufactured so much of our society is. I don't care to play along anymore. Know that you are a person who has a connection to your inner world while the majority are allowing that connection to be severed by the media and the rest of society's BS. Being able to see the truth is never a bad thing, even though it can feel pretty bad. You aren't alone. Hang in there!</p>

        <p>I've always been an outcast as well. My husband would be, except he's better at playing along to keep the peace. Since we were small children, we've both been acutely aware of corporate/government corruption, but husband kept his thoughts to himself and no one cared what I had to say. Now we're both speaking out more and people are starting to listen. Kinda.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many are too afraid to act. Instead, they say things like "Those are the rules", "They're just doing their job", "There's nothing we can do", "I don't want any trouble" while trying to ignore the trouble already at their doorstep. I get it. So many people on here say "defy the mandates" like there are no consequences, and I wholeheartedly agree that we can't just roll over, but there are consequences either way. Some people can't afford fines. Some people already have a criminal record, one more strike and they're fucked. My husband and I have our future ahead of us, as do other young people, and we must carefully weigh the costs and benefits of compliance vs dissent. Older people have already more-or-less lived their lives, so many don't care either way because the future consequences won't affect them.</p>
<p>I've always been outspoken about things like media bias and medical malpractice, but part of me always wondered if maybe I was wrong. No, this shit is for real, and "I told you so" honestly doesn't feel too good. I'm afraid. My husband is afraid, though he keeps it under wraps. This is why I don't really like the word "doomer" being thrown around: it can go both ways. When it comes to COVID itself, I couldn't care less, especially as the media pushes the "deadly virus" narrative more and more. But when it comes to totalitarianism and tyranny, I'm a doomer all the way. I would actually prefer a literal apocalypse over a police state with quarantines, mandatory medical treatment, and mass surveillance. Even if the rona was deadlier than bubonic plague, I would still be more afraid of how goverments and corporations would take advantage of the crisis.</p>
<p>But what exactly can we do about it? We're demonized as crazy conspiracy theorists, and a "silent majority" is a hand grenade filled with glitter and fucking confetti. My husband and I just want out. Off the grid, way out in the countyside, out of this society until it collapses and something new rises from the ashes. But we're afraid it won't happen. Husband is too stressed and depressed to work for money to buy land, I'm too stressed and depressed to so much as do laundry until I'm out of fresh panties. We're afraid we'll get old, sick, and complacent like our parents, rotting away in a rotting civilization. I feel like our only option is like-minded companions so we can lift each other up, but good fucking luck with that.</p>
<p>Sorry, I'll shut up now.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this. You and your husband are not alone. My wife, 2 small children and I live in a very rural community that has mostly avoided the hysteria. Life has, for the most part, gone back to normal. If I never went online to read the news, it would be like nothing was happening. </p>
<p>My wife and I also have similar struggles with our mental health and are always looking to connect with other like-minded people. Unfortunately, most of the people here prefer to live with their heads in the sand and ignore the craziness happening in the rest of the world. Can't say that I blame them.</p>

        <p>God I wish we lived in a rural area right now. Not that I don't love our current town or our current house, this is home. This house has been my husband's home since he was a baby. If things were different, we'd stay here and fix this place up, renovate with the goal of sustainability and self-sufficiency. It's not like the area is particularly urban or suburban, more like that awkward rural-urban fringe. But there are too many neighbors, way too close, way too invasive. Nevermind the overly strict zoning laws and building codes that clearly favor corporate interests over the inhabitants' health and safety.</p>
<p>My state thinks of itself as a Midwest California or New York. Our half of the state supposedly isn't like that, but you wouldn't know it by this particular area. I don't think people here are genuinely so afraid of the virus, just sucked in by the buzzwords and catchphrases - like masks, lockdowns, quarantines, contact tracing, temperature scanners, and social distancing are some cool new fashion trend imported from a coastal metropolis - courtesy of CBS and Facebook. If I could block my mother-in-law from watching the news and using social media, maybe I would be more at ease. Until I go to Walmart, see everyone masked and 6 feet apart, hear that announcement over the intercom on repeat every 3 minutes. Unfortunately, our shopping options are limited.</p>
<p>My husband and I keep trying to tell ourselves that it isn't too late. We might feel old as dirt, but we're only in our mid-20s, we're just going through a quarter-life crisis. We feel stereotypical though, those stereotypical Millennials who live with their parents until they're almost 30. We don't want to be like that, we want far away from our parents because they more-or-less welcome the government overreach, and we certainly don't want to be like them. The pandemic - or rather, the attempt to control ~~us~~ the virus - only exacerbates that sense of impotent urgency. It's hard not to feel overwhelmed or defeated.</p>
<p>I wish you and your family the best, for whatever that's worth. Wish in one hand, shit in the other lol</p>
