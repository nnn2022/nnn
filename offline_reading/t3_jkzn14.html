    <strong>Can you believe these anti-maskers? Honestly, they're worse than Hitler!</strong>
    <p><p>The way they walk around with the audacity to breath where and whenever they want without anything to cover their gross mouths, it's as if no one has taught them any manners. You cockroaches will breath where and when the government and my mob says it's ok because <strong>you DO NOT have a right to your body and it's natural functions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You wear pants don't you??</strong> it's pretty much the same thing, sure wearing pants doesn't inhibit any natural functions and most people just find it more comfortable to wear clothing in public as it keeps them warm but THAT DOESN'T MATTER, they're both made of cloth and that's enough similarity for me, so put it on your damn mouth!</p>
<p>Oh you think it's fine just to walk around all willy nilly literally killing people with every step you take, <strong>I guess you also deny the holocaust, spit on babies and hate black people to, racist.</strong></p>
<p>And don't you dare question the morality of the government pushing lockdowns and masks on people as a legal requirement. <strong>IF IT HELPS reduce covid cases it's ALWAYS WORTH IT</strong>, it doesn't matter if there's side effects and collateral damage blah blah blah those things aren't easy to put into a nice little line graph on the news and so I don't care about that data. Also I masturbate to those charts so you better not ever get rid of them!</p>
<p><strong>And you know what, I think we made the right call NOT doing a cost benefit analysis</strong> like Sweden because everyone knows you shouldn't question science, that's why scientists should literally control every aspect of society including the economy, they're just smarter people in every aspect of life, everyone knows that you idiots.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just wanted to unload on you guys. I'm not interested in rebuttals because <strong>I know for a FACT any studies or morality arguments you make are fake news</strong>. You don't have the Major news corporations behind you or all the fact checkers on social media that are 100% bipartisan and therefore what you say is not a fact! Check and mate you bloody simps.</p></p>

        <p>Totally man, people should just shut the fuck and put it on their face without question, thinking for yourself is bad for your health, scientists proved that years ago. Besides, if you don't wear one you're literally hitler!</p>

        <p>If somethings not bad for you it's okay to mandate wearing something? Like women being mandated to cover their faces in the middle east?</p>
<p>Let me answer that for you because I already know your rebuttal: "It's for other peoples health"</p>
<p>Ok well since everyone is in charge of everyones health will you wear a dildo on your head? It's not bad for you and it would make me a lot healthier because it would make me laugh and put me in a good mood</p>
