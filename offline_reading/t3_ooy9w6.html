        <p>The NIH did an "investigation" concluding that the NIH did not fund gain of function research.</p>
<p>What's next? Chevron does an "investigation" concluding that Chevron does not pollute? And people seriously trust that research?</p>

        <p>Rand Paul should have just asked Fauci if the NIH had funded the Wuhan lab. That's a pretty point blank question that Fauci wouldn't have been able to weasel his way out of. And, once  Fauci answered "Yes" to that question, I think everybody would have understood that to mean he funded bat virus experiments.</p>
<p>I don't think that getting into what qualifies as "gain of function" research was really worth it. It's a confusing term that most people have never heard before. Fauci can redefine "gain of function" research pretty much any way he wants, and the public is going to take his word over Rand Paul's.</p>

        <p>The problem with Fauci is that he, like most politicians, never gives a direct answer.  </p>
<p>Constantly avoiding providing direct answers to direct questions.</p>

        <p>The problem is he still would’ve weaseled out of it saying they didn’t directly find the lab they just funded a third party who just so happened to be in the lab doing the same thing that the government explicitly said not to do</p>

        <p>This is the opening paragraph on gain-of-function research in Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&rt;Gain-of-function research (GoF research or GoFR) is medical research that alters an organism or disease in a way that increases pathogenesis, transmissibility, or host range (the types of hosts that a microorganism can infect). This research is intended to reveal targets to better predict emerging infectious diseases and to develop vaccines and therapeutics. For example, influenza B can only infect humans and harbor seals.[1] <strong>Introducing a mutation that would allow influenza B to infect rabbits in a controlled laboratory situation would be considered a "gain of function" experiment as the virus did not previously have that function.</strong>[2][3] However, such an experiment could help reveal which parts of the virus are responsible for its host range, enabling the creation of antiviral medicines which block this function.[3]</p>
<p>And this is from the exchange between Paul and Fauci:</p>
<p><em>Paul:</em> "So you're saying, when you take an animal virus, and you increase its transmissibility to humans, you're saying that's not gain of function?"</p>
<p><em>Fauci:</em> "That is correct."</p>
<p>This testimony is up there with Fauci's previous word salad about how states with more stringent restrictions had worse covid outcomes because the citizens don't follow the restrictions as well as those citizens in states without any restrictions.</p>
<p>Rand Paul and Jim Jordan have made Fauci look like a doddering, incoherent imbecile, but half the country is so entrenched in their 'Republicans are dumb hurr durr' mindset that they can't  be bothered to see Fauci's braindead testimony for what it is.</p>

        <p>Very surprising, indeed!  It does seem some of WaPo journalism is divided, but I would never treat them as a viable source.</p>
<p>It is refreshing to see a journalist on a heavily left-leaning news site, even since the very beginning of the pandemic, doubt the authenticity of Fraudci and his claims.</p>
