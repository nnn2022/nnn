    <strong>"Before Corona, people used to go to college 5 times a week"</strong>
    <p><p>Thats what i said to my dad in a heavy argument</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Bascialy im a college student and i cant concentrate on online lessons, i really hate online lessons because i came from a very dysfunctional family and they often fight with each other going to the point that they turn the internet off just to punish my sister so that i cant even get on it plus i get distracted at home easily and this especialy for my education (SDE) has consuquences for my GPA.. it also effected my sleep rythm since you dont need to prepare for online lessons that much so i often feel tired most of the time</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So at my class there where 4 subgroups... that has different timeslots and there are people that like online lessons so they would trade their place with me in exchange for me to go to college, This is pretty fair right? It was allowed by the College itself. i managed to get 3 days to go to college however when i told my dad this he didnt take it and ordered me to stay at home </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I said what the fuck why.... he basicaly said that it isnt "normal to go 3 days to college physically" i wasnt mad at this i was shuttered... i tried to explain why i needed to go to college and he accused me of lying and to exaggerate the problems i had with online learning... i said i cant succeed my education if i have to learn online.. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My dad said that <strong>what are you doing isnt normal</strong> i answered: What the fuck... how is that not normal because sitting in front of an online screen getting minimal information is fucking normal because COVID-19, he eventualy allowed me to go and said </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Instead of sitting at home you choose to travel 3 hours to go to college""</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Before Corona, people used to go to college 5 times a week"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I was amazed that the man that literally belived that War Child is a CIA font subcumbs to the new normal i dont really fear the virus that much but i rather fear those people that think this is the new normal and even worse that they will enforce it Its also weird that something i used to do normaly is just seen as insane </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL:DR Dad thinks that going to college is not normal</p></p>

        <p>You‚Äôre not gonna change his mind, some people are just dense like that. I live in Melbourne so my uni is completely online, and my Dad treats it as if it‚Äôs a normal thing and constantly wonders why I can‚Äôt concentrate properly when nearly all of my civil liberties have been eroded in the span of a few months üòÖ</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm a freshman in college and yes online classes fucking suck. I have received bad grades and zeros already in some classes because I couldn‚Äôt find the links to homework assignments, quizzes, zoom links to join recitations and lectures. I‚Äôm still surprised I graduated high school considering I went from high honor roll to basically not caring about school and throwing my academic integrity out of the window those last 4 months of senior year with ‚Äúremote‚Äù classes. Anyone that thinks this should be the new norm needs a good punch in the face.</p>

        <p>If I might. I'm just look at the language you use in the post, " i cant concentrate", " i really hate ", " i get distracted" " i often feel tired".  Not to criticize but these indicate emotional arguments.</p>
<p>Now consider your father.  He's probably scared spitless of catching a fatal disease. He's stuck at home with at least you and your dysfunctional sister, right?  He's older and probably worried about losing a job if he still has it, otherwise he's worried about not having a job.</p>
<p>tl;dr he doesn't see it as non-normal, he is justifying his own fears and frustrations. To him, at this point in time, watching death statistics on the nightly news is "normal". </p>
<p>I have no real advice here. But I think everyone can do with a little more acceptance of other people's differences right now.  Possibly just venting on Reddit helps.  I hope it has.</p>

        <p>OP very clearly explained their experience and feelings and here you are dismissing them, oh because <em>you</em> prefer online? Everyone is not you. </p>
<p>I loved every moment of uni (college). Classes were amazing, seeing friends, lecturers, the discussions we had. On campus life. Seeing people. Human interaction. I learn better in person and would never have done well had I been forced online during my degree. My lecturers cared, some very much did. Plus they were interesting people... and would have been had they not cared too.</p>
<p>Not everyone has your experience. Not everyone learns well online. Leave the OP alone. OP wanting to go in person doesn't prevent you choosing an online degree.</p>
<p>Online would be far from a blessing for all... so arrogant. Grades suffer for many. Drop out increases.</p>
