    <strong>All Doomers Are The Same, From My Observations.</strong>
    <p><p>So, waiting in long ass lines and observing these obedient slaves of the government, I have come across the conclusions that, they all have the same characteristics. The Men who are wearing the most masks, and dictating others in their gay ass voices and saying "Hey wear the mask, you killing grandma" are fat and have no spine. I legit see these people walking alone with 2 masks, and when I'm doing My thing, I never wear a mask in a store until I'm told to, these people look at Me like I'm from a different planet. I like to intimidate them, so they look the other way not even realizing how big of a fools they are.</p>
<p>So, these people being a good little boy/girl for gov and keeping their ass bent over 24/7, is in their genes. And, the women who have made a big deal for Me not masking are never the hot ones. So, once, I walk into a store with no mask, and not giving af, this trans thing whatever (short blue haired, fat) and I can't seem to know what that thing is. It's dressed like a guy, but the feature's are of a women, and to get you an idea, that trans health official who got put by Biden, that thing looks like him. Anyways. In her loud bitchy voice she screams at Me, "How dare you come into my store, not wearing a mask? People get killed because of people like you!" So, I listen and then tell her the facts, and suprisingly she told Me "You maybe right and make sense" And the cherry on top is I leave right after I tell her the facts, and she's like "aren't you buying anything?" I'm like, "I don't give business to foolish and clowns like you." I then left, and I overheard her swearing and that "thing" got so pissed LOL. </p>
<p>Lazy, unambitious, and having a spine so bent, and an ass, who is only thirsty for daddy government 24/7, is the perfect way to describe these people. They all share the same characteristics, views and ideologies. And, alot of the anti makers who I have talked with, they are like Me. Free thinkers who dgaf and who want to live life to the fullest, and do what they gotta do. I'm glad, there are some proper people, but they are becoming extinct. Personally, were I live Ontario is fucked. I see Myself having no bright future here due to dying economy, and these lockdowns are getting to Me now and affecting My mental health and especially being surrounded by doomers. Here's a sub for the fellow Ontarians here because there are many here.</p>

<p>Thank effing God, I have a USA passport. Most likely, I'll go down to Texas or Florida. Freedom over everything. No matter how much money you have, it can't buy you power or freedom so F it. Life is an adventure and all about taking risks, so all of you based Canadians, save up and gtf out of this authoritarian, dystopian hellhole. Life is too fucking short to follow these tyrants. I didnt come in this life, to be a slave and a lab rat, unlike these doomers who are happily volunteering to test this "vaccine." Enjoy life and do what you gotta do and plan accordingly. And F you doomers.</p></p>

        <p>Nobody cares. #mybodymychoice, I can do whatever the hell I want in this "free" country. Go back to quad masking pal, well,  I suggest shove those masks up your ass. Because that's the only way you people get off!</p>

        <p>Well, yeah, do whatever by me, you can go out without a mask because I can and masks actually do make breathing a little harder, you only have to wear a mask in crowded buildings. Vaccines are also not mandatory. Improving your health is good but you don't need to do it. You don't need to insult me with the lamest insults, I know you want attention and are intentionally bullying me so I get mad, but being calm is always the way to go, always remember: stress was the reason I got scammed out of more than 200$ worth of steam items.</p>

        <p>First of all, I don't delete comments like a coward like you, and neither do I care about you.</p>
<p>&rt; I know you want attention and are intentionally bullying me so I get mad, </p>
<p>You sound like a max 10 year old. Hey buddy doomer, I have a job proposal for you. In order to make Fauci proud, I suggest you wear all the masks that come in the box and super glue them on your face permanently, in the honor of you're Lord Fauci! He will be very proud and he will gift you more masks on top of that. How generous of him!</p>

        <p>How calm do you want me to be and do you want me to reply to that first statement in an angry tone for your free attention? Atleast you got the age guess close enough. I hope this calm tone can calm you down and make you answer my question.</p>

        <p>You seem to really want me to be in an angry tone. Well if you really want it, fine, age doesn't matter in learning, if tegnology would have been just as good as now, boomers wouldnt be sharing fake news because they would have the same intelect as us non adults.</p>
