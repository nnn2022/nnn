        <p>I was never planning on getting this shot, but holy shit this is worse than i could have imagined.  Kids are way worse off getting the “vaccine”, how can they keep giving it to them?</p>

        <p>Honestly this is why I think they pushing the delta variant scare mongering so much. They know that the vast majority are not going to vaccinate their children even people who are pro vaccine.  I am a suburban mother of young children (8 and 5) and I talk to other suburban mothers of young children and I’m hearing same thing from literally every parent…”i got the vaccine but I will not give it my kids.” </p>
<p>I didn’t get the vaccine and I certainly won’t be giving it to my children for something that poses NO risk to them. I truly believe this a losing battle for the elite.  They know it.  Also tying masking and  education to the vaccine (require vaccine for schools) is literally illegal in most states so it won’t work.  Also states would have to offer equal education to those students who have to quarantine if exposed and are not vaccinated and that is a legitimate unconstitutional nightmare for them</p>

        <p>I’m a suburban dad to three boys(10, 12, 14).  No way are they getting the shot. They have all of their other vaccines. My wife and I both had Covid in January. We’re all good and don’t need to enter the vaccine death lottery.  I couldn’t believe the parents around us getting their 12 yr olds vaccinated ASAP.  Parents who are doctors and pharmacists too. I don’t get it, they’re smart people</p>

        <p>Same here!! My sister got her 12 year old daughter vaccinated bc all the girls at school were doing it. I was like really?? Is this what we’ve become. Teenagers peer pressuring! Your kids are slightly older so you are ina different scenario but my daughter is still in preschool and not one parent has said they are vaccinating their child and it’s ludicrous that the government is pushing this so hard on parents and kids to make this decision.  These are children for Christ’s sake! They won’t even let you eat soft cheese while pregnant but this somehow is ok?</p>

        <p>I just worry that they might start to require it, at least in a round about way.  Like my kid can’t play lacrosse unless he’s vaccinated.  Luckily, I’m in a pretty red area of Pennsylvania. My kid’s schools were open 5 days/week for the whole year. No hybrid or total virtual nonsense.  Who knows what will happen this fall/winter.</p>

        <p>I’m in A semi red area in PA…my district was crazy last year but they’ve seemed to relax this year after so many parents complained.  I pulled my girls out and put them in Catholic school bc it was too out of control. I really don’t think PA will mandate it bc it’s not possible…the legislature would have to pass a bill and we know that won’t happen.</p>

        <p>Nonsense!! The vaccines have been approved by the science, safe and effective. Say it with me: safe and effective. I don’t care if your quality of life is ruined or even if you drop dead from these vaccines, it is your duty to do that regardless.</p>

        <p>From the CDC perspective - a hospitalization of several healthy kid with mild myocarditis is better than a single ventilation and death of a 79 year old with diabetes.</p>
