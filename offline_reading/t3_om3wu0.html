        <p>This story is fearmongering garbage-</p>
<p>1) Both the mom and daughter are obese, so they are at risk for pretty much everything. These people don’t care about their health and neither should we.</p>
<p>2) If this story is legit and COVID is so deadly, why does the ‘article’ have an image of the mother in the hospital room with no mask on next to her ‘dying’ morbidly obese daughter?</p>

        <p>They're requiring masks for everything medical nowadays. My God, I had to wear a mask to go to my annual physical last weekend. That's just in a normal doctor's office-not a hospital.</p>
<p>I can't imagine they wouldn't require a mask when you're seeing COVID patients in the hospital. This seems very fake.</p>

        <p>I suppose it depends on the hospital. My husband took his mom in for a procedure. They handed him a mask at the door and said everybody needs to wear a mask. He said thank you, took it, and put it on his wrist. Nobody said shit to him. He didn't have it on his face the entire time.</p>

        <p>And, actually, I don't think they'd even be letting her see her daughter at all if she was hospitalized for COVID. Let alone let her see her daughter without a mask on.</p>

<p>Can you please attack with data instead of fearmongering? One look at r/CovidVaccinated is enough to realize how much the side-effects are under-reported.</p>

        <p>That is so sad. I’m sad the mom feels regret bc even if she was vaccinated she could still be in a hospital bed like many who were fully vaxxed but are still being hospitalized or dying from covid anyway... </p>
<p>The parents who did vaccinate also feel regret. Teens have died after the vaccines and teens have become disabled, likely for life. Their parents regret getting their kids the vaccine.</p>
<p>I feel so bad for this woman and her daughter. To be honest the daughter’s face looks heavy so I wonder if she’s overweight and therefore at a higher risk of having covid with complications? I don’t mean that to be rude but my friend who is a nurse said everyone who was hospitalized where she was was obese or overweight. Maybe the media should be more honest about who is most likely to get complications so then people can choose if the risk of the vaccines may be worth it for them or not. </p>
<p>I have a lower BMI and I’m not getting a vaccine. I do know there’s a chance I could end up getting covid and having something horrible happen... but I personally feel like the vaccine poses a bigger risk to me. I’m sure this poor woman assumed her daughter is young so the vaccine was riskier. Obviously she was trying to protect her daughter so I hope she doesn’t regret it and I hope media doesn’t shame her into regretting it forever. </p>
<p>Have you guys heard of Ivory Heckner? She was a reporter and leaked her management basically telling her not to interview doctors about covid treatments because the CEO didn’t want that, etc. It sort of just showed that even journalists who want to report on side effects and such can’t or their job is at risk.</p>
