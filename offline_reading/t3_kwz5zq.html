    <strong>Anyone else concerned with the virtual world being normalized?</strong>
    <p><p>It seems that we’re heading towards a world where everything is virtual. Where you don’t have to leave your house for anything. Where it’s considered weird/ taboo to approach strangers/strike up a conversation and be friendly in person. A world where school/work is predominantly online. A world in which your social media profiles define you. A world where dating apps are the only way to meet people instead of in person like a normal fucking human being. A world where kids would rather play video games than play outside.( don’t get me wrong I love video games but you know what I mean.) A world where eye contact and smiling has dissipated because of the normalization of mask wearing. A world completely reliant on big corporations instead of local businesses. Maybe I’m being overly dramatic but this COVID shit has me really worried about what the future will look like.</p></p>

        <p>I'm concerned about it as well. Even before covid, social media made people awkward around each other and glued to their phones in public. I hate social media, but it's one of the few ways we're allowed to communicate right now. I think this "pandemic" has exacerbated an already existing problem and we should consciously try not to be dependent on these technologies anymore.</p>

        <p>I hate this over-exposure to virtual everything. It's lame and these damn screens hurt my eyes after a little while; the blue light messes with me and so does the flicker rate with all of the scrolling and what not. Not the mention that the internet is just getting lamer and lamer. In much regard, it's getting sterilized where you mainly hear just one globalist demoralizing narrative steeped full of lies and manipulations. And don't get me started on the media aspect like with Netflix; practically all I see when I watch that nowadays is propaganda and it just pisses me off. Even if a story is good, they just have with sully it with some kind of subversive globalist propaganda. The tv is of course is even worse. Even if I wanted to go hang out with people in real life, I now have to take into account the ridiculous niceties that may come up; like, how brainwashed is this person by the propaganda hive mind and do I have to capitulate to their disinformedness in order for them to tolerate me? Chances are, I would so it's hard to even wanna bother.</p>

        <p>If this led blue light bullshit wasn't bad enough with screens everywhere. You step out into your car to drive or hell walk the streets at night and you are struck with way brighter blue lights from all these new led headlights. I hate driving at night now when it use to be very relaxing.</p>

        <p>Yellow also helps cut through fog/rain better. The blue/white light reflects off water more so they are actually worse in the rain/fog when you need better headlights the most. That's why you see most fog lights as yellow.</p>

        <p>I have a bf but if we did break up I don't think I would go on a dating app...I always thought they were for either losers or people looking for a ONS. Even before the lockdown and everything went virtual, people pushed me <em>so much</em> to try dating services, I don't understand why there is so much enthusiasm for it. Why are people so willing to use the app and so determined to make others use it too?</p>

        <p>I don't like the hookup culture either...I don't feel safe going home with a guy I've only met a couple of hours prior, and I don't feel safe inviting a stranger into my home. I'm fine with casual relationships (ie not intending to get married and have kids, just dating for fun) but not ok with sleeping with some random guy I don't know. There have been plenty of news stories about murders and assaults as a result of dating apps!</p>

        <p>Wasn't there a school that made a kid wear a mask in zoom classes because his family went out out town and was supposed to quarantine to 'set an example"?</p>

        <p>Yes, I am.  I’m beginning to see how social media &amp; constant virtual living is manipulating my mind.  They decide what we can watch, listen to, etc.  this has been happening with TV as well.  But nothing was as censored/“fact-checked” and we spent time outdoors.  Having to meet up with people to see how they were doing.  </p>
<p>This will become the new normal (I hate that saying), unless we RESIST and take our lives back!  I’m still having friends over.  I’m not wearing a mask anywhere unless I’m asked (rarely do I get asked).  If I’m ill, yes I’ll stay home.  But otherwise I’m going where I want.  I will relocate to states that push back if needed.  I’ve already lost best friends and family members over this and their hypocrisy.  I don’t think they understand at all.  It’s a sad time, but it’s obvious what’s going on here.</p>

        <p>Yes I agree it definitely seems to be heading in that direction. Personally I am a very outdoors type of person and no one can tell me that being stuck at home is a good thing. I will try to go out as much as possible, smile, talk to people. If this is a crime, let me be convicted.</p>

        <p>It’s all very weird. Even if this is part of the Great Reset plans, why? I don’t get why it benefits the elites if we only shop at big box stores and use our phones for dating and are spending most our time gaming or on social media. What am I missing?</p>

        <p>If all our previously in-person activities are online now, it means they are supervised, censored, and can be taken away from you at any given moment. The data from your online activity is collected, analyzed, and used to sold to people who use it to sell you products and ideologies. So, now that becomes ALL your activity. Every human connection, all your love and joy and passion, every insecurity and fear, can be commodified for someone else’s benefit and used to control you.</p>

        <p>The way I see certain things is that things we say and do are easier to trace if you do it online or via app or other things that can be stored in a database. The reason why we have to be traced is another question. Can be for ads and other cosumer researches, can be for future law breaking reasons or even for more controlling things but I don't know for sure. In my opinion it's always about money somhow.</p>
