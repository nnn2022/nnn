    <strong>How do I respond when people ask if I'm getting vaccinated? (Side note: planning a pregnancy)</strong>
    <p><p>Serious question. "Fuck off" comes to mind but I need to not get fired from my job. At work I keep hearing "Once we get enough people vaccinated..." "I think we've all been vaccinated here..." "When are you getting yours?" And I hate how THIS situation has somehow made it acceptable for people at work to inquire about your health related choices then get deer in the headlights or judgey when you say "maybe at some point". Do they do this shit with influenza? "Oh its available to everyone now" "I encourage you to" "Boy ya know we gotta reach that herd immunity"</p>
<p>Sorry, I just need to vent and ask this question where people get it because anywhere else I'll get labeled as ignorant and simply "vaccine hesitant" like I'm some project to be worked on. As a side note I'm planning a pregnancy and despite that, I still hear BuT iTs SaFeR tO gEt ThE vAcCiNeeeee despite my OBGYN saying she's had about 20 of her pregnant patients get covid and 19 of them were mild cases, the one who had it worse had essentially flu like symptoms and turned out fine, and my DOCTOR said don't get it if you have concerns about fertility because surprise! Its been affecting some women's monthly cycles (Google that or head to CovidVaccinated for a great read, even postmenopausal women are reporting bleeding as a result of the vax). Not enough info out now as to why this is happening- again, surprise.</p>
<p>Obviously don't want to divulge that info at work. I had a miscarriage earlier this year that my boss had to be told about bc I was out for a week recovering/surgery etc, despite that he periodically asks my vax status. Thought he could read between the lines with part of my reasoning, but guess not? Which irritates the living hell out of me, nobody seems to look past what the media and other people parrot to them. Get the vaccine if you want it. More power to you. I'm opting out based on my own circumstances and comfort level. But yet somehow thats not good enough.</p>
<p>Sorry, rant over but any polite way to give reasoning and shut the conversation down permanently, all while keeping my job, is appreciated.</p></p>

<p>May turn in to more once vaccine passports etc get wide spread. But for now, in casual conversation, this would be the easiest nonconfrontational way. 
Just be ready for the follow ups. Ooh, which one? How were your side effects? You believe those idiots that won't get one?
Also this may include you to a club you don't want to be a part of. But still the easiest way for the moment.</p>

        <p>That's easier said than done. I really don't give a shit what people think, but the principle bothers me. Why is it that the people who question things carefully, look at the effects that weren't talked about in the clinical trials, and don't jump right in line for an experimental vaccine are looked down upon like we're morons?</p>

        <p>I'm in a similar situation, about 15 weeks pregnant but haven't told anyone at work.  Normally, I'm okay with questions that fall outside the "professional norm" as I assume most people have good intentions and by nature, we're all curious and like to understand one another better!</p>
<p>That said, questions about the vaccine are very off-putting to me.  I have been asked by my direct manager (very casually, to our whole team, didn't feel confrontational AT ALL) and after I gave my response I could immediately tell he felt bad for asking.  I've also been asked directly by my CEO.  This one was more nerve-racking for me because I have less of a relationship with him than I do my direct manager.  Both times, I calmly and politely said "No, I haven't gotten it nor do I plan to.  I neither have a need or a want to do so.  But I'm happy it's available to those that need/want it".  Both accepted my answer, didn't push, and my CEO even said "I understand.  We don't know the long term side effects and everyone has their own reasons.  To each their own".  I know I'm lucky to work with what I hope are genuine people.  I'm more skeptical about my CEO and his sincerity to my response, but whatever.</p>
<p>Even if I wasn't pregnant, I wouldn't be getting it.  And while I'd like to give a smartass response back when being asked, I again try to assume the best in those asking and remain polite (I too want to keep my job ;)).</p>

        <p>Just say in response "did you get your fanny felt lastnight?" When they look at your with disgust for asking such an inappropriate question, just say "not an appropriate question, huh? A bit like yours" then grin and walk away.</p>

        <p>If your boss is male you have the upper hand if you bring up your doctor's recommendation plus the existing potential fertility risks with the vaccine. </p>
<p>It is kinda shitty, but as a female we do have some asymmetric power when it comes to this kind of stuff. Next time he asks you if you, say your doctor recommended against it due to "pre-existing conditions" that he already knows about and he shouldn't be prying into your medical business and bringing up painful memories. Ask to speak in private if necessary. </p>
<p>You really have all the power in this situation. Obviously don't be hostile but make it clear that your boss has no business in your healthcare choices unless it affects your ability to work. </p>
<p>Sorry about your miscarriage, I'm sure that was very painful. I wish you luck in growing your family.</p>

        <p>I say, “Absolutely not. I will not be taking an experimental vaccine.” People need to know that there are regular folks who aren’t going along with this vile narrative so they can gather up some courage as well.</p>

        <p>I just told the few who have asked that my age group doesn’t have a high mortality rate. One person looked at me skeptically and I showed him the stats for our state. Conversation was over after that. I’d like to think that he walked away with something to think about.</p>
