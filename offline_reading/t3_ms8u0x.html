    <strong>NH governor is allowing the mask mandate to expire!!</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t live in NH, I live in Maine (sadly) but when I saw that I was like “yay! It <em>should</em> be optional!” Then this bitch replied to my comment saying that I can just stay home if I don’t like wearing a mask (you can too, bitch). But my comment said NOTHING about me, just that it should’ve been optional this whole time and if you want to continue wearing a mask, go for it. If not, then that’s cool too. I kept it neutral but this bitch had to jump down my throat so I replied and basically repeated my comment and added that it should be up to the business owners. I mean it definitely should be. Some small business owners are like that in Maine but of course everywhere else you have to wear a mask. We’re all used to it at this point but I’m over it and it’s time to lift the mandates. I went to a gun range last night and nobody was wearing any masks. (Only four were though). It was great! That’s what it’s all about!! </p>
<p>Lmao but the comment section was of course mixed but I saw some comments saying that I wish our governor would do the same (she’s a f<em>cking bitch so I doubt it). But my thing is, people are never happy. You can never please them. So whenever I see posts about governors being smart and lifting mandates, I just </em>know<em> people will get all bitchy because they can’t make up their minds. They actually </em>like* the mandates as if they can’t do this shit themselves. That’s why I’m commenting more because I don’t care anymore. Lifting mandates don’t mean that you can’t do the things you’re told to do, it just means you have the option to continue doing so or just live your life. Of course it’s up to the business owner but still. I’m done!</p></p>

        <p>I'm in maine too, just hoping I can find a restaurant or two close to the border that revel in the new found masklessness so we can drive down and party (in a kid-friendly way, they need to get back to loud crowded restaurants too!)</p>
