    <strong>If the injections turned out to be ‘safe and effective’, vaccine passports would still be wrong</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s near pointless to argue about the safety of the jabs, especially with so much suppression and corruption going on in the science world.  This is about more than that.  It’s about principle.  It’s about taking a stand against tyranny while it’s still in its (relatively) early stages, about thinking critically about why this injection is being pushed so hard when compared to, say, anything to do with AIDS.  It’s about not trusting our oppressors to have our best interests at heart.  Even if the jabs were safe and effective, scaring and shaming people into getting them echoes many of the worst parts of history, and a lot of us have seen the dark places it’s likely going.  Covid isn’t the plague, and the injections aren’t even the only answer to it - drugs like ivermectin are disgracefully suppressed, when they could be saving lives.  This isn’t about the quality of the jabs.  Too many arguments get bogged down in the science of their safety or lack thereof.</p>
<p>This is about the thing that’s been on the line right from the beginning: FREEDOM</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I just think that’s a more difficult angle to make concrete arguments for.  They’ll just throw ‘experts’ at you who say the vaccine is ‘safe and effective’.  Principle is solid</p>
