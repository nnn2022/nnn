    <strong>Ways to meet new friends during the pandemic?</strong>
    <p><p>I know this might not be the place to ask these types of questions but you are one of the few groups that is not completely brainwashed by corporate and government propaganda so I am asking here. </p>
<p>I am a 20-something in the Denver metro. Most of my friends have either bitten the propaganda hook, line, and sinker or they just no longer have time for me because they are super busy. Because of this I am looking for new friends that I can do things with. We don't have to agree on everything but I would hope they would be able to just do something. In another sub I am sure someone would say a Zoom meeting but I will kick their goddam ass if they did. </p>
<p>That being said, does anyone have any ideas to meet people who are not going to be bitching about masks for 5 hours?</p></p>

        <p>Following this post because I could use this advice too! Even in a city in a southern conservative state (Tennessee), I'm having a hard time with this right now. After a dinner with some friends that involved one of them talking about having to quarantine for at least the 5th time this year due to another "covid scare" and another one repeating her story of the time she had covid as if she was a cancer survivor, I decided that I need a new group of friends.</p>

        <p>I went on a weekender to Utah with my roommate and that was a huge mistake. Outside of the parks he wanted to hide in the hotel room the whole trip. He also had me do the same. He was too afraid to go to restaurants and bars and whatnot and I just spent the whole trip not wanting to argue with him simply because it would make the trip longer than it needed to be.</p>

        <p>Also in Denver and no not really. People on this sub brag about never wearing masks anywhere they go. You can't even enter a building here without someone screaming at you. As far as I can tell it's statewide sheepification. Fortunately I do well alone, but that being said keep me in mind. I may need back up if SHTF.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I wouldn't mind civil disobedience but I also am in a position where I could get severely punished if the wrong people know about it. I have friends who might snitch to the cops. </p>
<p>I dunno. I am kinda tied here for the next few years but after that I might move out of town. It's not the same.</p>

        <p>I’m not in Denver but a few people who replied are, maybe DM each other and organize a meet up? Just a thought. When I lived in a city where I didn’t know any one I was afraid to try meetup groups and stuff because I didn’t want to deal with people who wanted to do a bunch of weird covid theater while socializing, but you shouldn’t have that problem with people on this sub. Just a thought :)</p>

<p>We would get along so well.</p>
<p>What I have done in the past is try new things that are specifically something you do in a group.  In my case, I joined a MMA gym on a whim and for two years I was a part of an awesome community I had no idea existed just a few minutes away. </p>
<p>Nowadays  things are closed, but I am noticing certain businesses refusing to close, such as my old MMA gym. So I would say look around as hard as you can, maybe check private forums for your local area.</p>
