        <p>My kids are 24, 22 and 19 now.    Two are independent adults living in their own and the youngest works full time and has a FT course load at school (he's out now but did till a few weeks ago).   Also I had 4 (later 5) days a week where I only had school or work but not both and because I worked nights the weekend days I had fully with my kids until I went to work in the evening so from about 6AM until about 5PM I had uninterrupted time with my kids to do all the stuff I needed to do so my weekdays would run smoothly and still have plenty of time to spend just having fun together.    On weekdays I managed my class schedule to match up with their school schedule and I eventually switched to doing 4 10hr days instead of 5 8 hour days so I only had 2 terribly exhausting days a week.  It's not impossible at all... I wouldn't WANT to do it again because it was intense but if I had to I defo could.</p>

        <p>So what you are saying is that unless kids are out of the hands of parents for 8 hours a day 5 days a week they end up like this... so parents make kids stupid and fat??? </p>
<p>I seriously doubt any of this is true and seriously f off to the liar who said this.    I had to keep my kid at home too... it was his senior year and I was super upset (he really didn't give a shit though).   I made sure our family went outside every day, we made sure he had all the support he needed for his classes, we still did things every day to stay active and happy.    If other parents didn't bother then their kids being fat and diseases idiots now is their fault but losing 40% cognitive function???? I mean seriously you people know what that means right?   It means that almost half their brain is now useless.    Just because they spent the past year with their parents.   </p>
<p>Even you must find this asinine statement to be offensive.    There is no new normal.    Just actual normal which it returning all over the place.    I haven't worn a mask in ages and (at least in NYS) no one has to unless they choose to with the exception of private businesses requiring them sometimes but that's not really any worse then the no shoes, no shirt, no service rules.   Those annoy me too when it's 100 degrees and I just came from the beach but it is what it is.   </p>
<p>I'm not going to say the last year was good because it was a shit show run by an orange idiot in America but this is nonsense fear mongering BS.    The more likely thing is that kids spent too much time on screens, their parents probably fed them too much processed foods and they are about a year behind at worst in school.    But so is the rest of the world.    The little buggers will just have to work a little harder to catch up.    I mean they barely do any work in school until about 8th grade anyway... so you lost out on some badly written poetry and a terrible cutout turkey at thanks giving.    </p>
<p>Every decent parent would have made the time to do proper meal prep and tutoring their kids after work and made sure they had plenty of outdoor time daily.    Just because they couldn't go mess around on the playground while mommy takes a ton of pics for Instagram doesn't mean they couldn't go outside.   And just because the school wasn't feeding the kids 2 of their meals every day doesn't mean the parents are incapable of providing them with healthy meals at home.    And just because school (basically useless anyway unless you're kid is a dunce or in the gifted program... where they actually do teach something)  was online doesn't mean good parents weren't reading with their kids and teaching them every day.    I mean for elementary kids literally everything can be a lesson, leaves turning... lesson in weather, climate, nature and science... not to mention art.   Cool song on the radio... lesson in music theory, music history, PE (dancing in the living room counts).   Making breakfast... lesson in chemistry, health, nutrition, economics.    Paying bills... lesson in math, finance,  as well as l lessons not taught in school like personal responsibility and how to actually pay your bills / make and follow a budget.    </p>
<p>Seriously people I did this 15 years BEFORE we had a lockdown.   Every thing is a lesson to a young kid and it's a parents responsibility to make sure their children are properly taken care of.   That includes their nutrition, education and access to the outdoors... and even in the most trying of circumstances you were always able to at least take a daily walk.    So again I say that while this last year was a shit show of epic proportions, this is complete BS.</p>
