    <strong>Does anyone have compilation of info/links to persuade my doomer brother against vaccine &amp; help him wake up about everything?</strong>
    <p><p>My brother is a healthy, 20 something doomer (really he just loves telling me what to do and has irrational paranoia and cannot see clearly at ALL. Very easily influenced.) who told me yesterday he will be receiving the vaccine “as soon as it comes out.” He was telling my mom “after she gets the vax, you can do XYZ....” and I cut him off right there. I said she isn’t having the vaccine. We proceeded to get into a spat and of course I’m the one with a tin foil hat. </p>
<p>I told him look, I can provide you with every source but will you actually read them this time? Will you actually listen to me? He said in a condescending tone.. “sure! Show me what you have.” (As if I have no reason at all for concern.)</p>
<p>So anyways, is there some sort of master list on this subreddit used to convinced doomer against their actual doom? I’d rather not have to put it together myself and I know how good some of you guys are with your info collection. Thank you in advance for sharing!</p></p>
