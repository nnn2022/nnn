    <strong>At the end of my rope</strong>
    <p><p>Hey y'all, long time lurker/commenter, first time poster. I'm at the end of my rope here. I'm staunchly against the vaccine - not because of 5G or microchips but because of the terrible history of failure and lost court battles all of these companies have, plus all the bad reactions and deaths that I believe have been cussed by the vaccine. But here I am, a seasonal farm hand, approaching the end of my job and looking for another for overwinter, and everyone is asking for proof of COVID vaccine. I don't want to work a corporate job - I've only recently set out to make it in this field and now that I've got experience and got my foot in the door, I want to stay here. For context I'm a healthy 23 year old male who just recently gave up smoking cigarettes and has also started working out regularly in addition to the "work out" of my job (physically intensive). </p>
<p>I can get the vaccine quick easy and free. My current boss is hardcore vaccine motivated (even though her whole family, including her 16 year old daughter, have been vaxxed, she's still worried about it for some reason because my partner and I aren't.) She's offered us each  $50 to get it. Both of us are completely against the idea of taking it and vaccine passports and have been since before this whole shit even started. .</p>
<p>So I guess the point of this post is to complain as well as to ask - what should I do? It looks to me like I'm gonna have to get the vaccine to get a job in the field I'm in, and I'm not willing to lose out and go back to cleaning people's fucking offices for 10.09 and hour (sadly am very unskilled laborer with no college educations dn on the bottom side of poor.) I'm morally torn. I've been homeless before and am afraid of that to be frsnk. Thanks for any and all advice. Keep up the good work NNN, I support all of y'all in your fight against this tyranny. Much love.</p>
<p>Edit: busted phone screen so I can't see to fix some of my spelling mistakes, ignore it please.</p></p>

        <p>Your boss is a fascist cuck. I'm sorry he's put you in such a tough decision. My only advice is to try and argue against him and present him the facts to try and change his mind (probably won't work but your relationship with him is fucked either way so its worth a go). Hope you manage to convince him or find a decent job elsewhere mate, hang in there!</p>

        <p>It might seem like you'd lose your job if you didn't get it, but the fact is- you have nothing to lose. Not when your arm shows up magnetic after you take it. Tell your boss that they can try to shovel shit with a magnetic arm- you've got your livelihood to think of.</p>

        <p>My brother's about your age and his work pressured him to get the shot. Now a magnet sticks  to his injection site and he's stressed because he does't know what kind of sketchy shit is in his body.</p>
<p>Don't let these lunatics bully you. Your health is priceless, $50 bucks to risk it is an insult. </p>
<p>Who cares about money when you've got priceless freedom and youth? These highly paid vaxxed zombies are slaves in a gilded cage, slowly rotting away from being in captivity as lab-rats.</p>
