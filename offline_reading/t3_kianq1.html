    <strong>Life has become fake</strong>
    <p><p>Everything about this has made everything and everyone feel completely fake. People just thinking it's ok to replace real human interaction and events with a stupid zoom call makes me feel sick! I've been in full time school for months but all of a sudden "the virus mutated, back to March!" despite the mutation being <em>no more dangerous</em>, there's not any evidence to support it being 70% more contagious last time I checked, the virus has mutated <em>thousands</em> of times <em>just in nine months</em> and they've known about this particular mutation since <em>September</em>! As much as I hated school, they're now going full online and I just don't see the point. I'm probably going to get rubbish grades on my highers which are pretty damn important because the big chances to prove myself are now gone. Everything about this virtual life is completely fake and I honestly don't want to live in a world where it's all just for the camera. People my age are at no risk from the virus, so why are our futures just thrown under the bus? And my mum who is also anti lockdown says that she won't back me up if I refuse this to make a point because "it's the law and there's nothing we can do about it".</p>
<p>Basically, I'm sick of this pathetic excuse for life being stuck behind a screen.</p></p>

<p>That's my plan. If more of us move south (and, hopefully, if the hypochondriacs flee to their brethren in NY and CA) we might stand a chance. Yes, it sounds like OP can't do much, but he can still make his voice heard and influence his peer group.</p>

<p>&rt; “So it must be said, too, that we won’t be able to treat the entire French population. Choices will have to be made.” This is how a virology expert sums up, in a September 7, 2005 article in <em>Le Monde</em>, what would happen in the event of a bird flu pandemic. “Terrorist threats,” “natural disasters,” “virus warnings,” “social movements” and “urban violence” are, for society’s managers, so many moments of instability where they reinforce their power, by the selection of those who please them and the elimination of those who make things difficult. Clearly these are, in turn, opportunities for other forces to consolidate or strengthen one another as they take the other side.</p>

        <p>I'm not solely thinking of myself. It was a rant. I was feeling pretty awful, so I came here in hopes of some positive comments that could motivate me to keep going. However, my stance does not come from not wanting to stay home and watch netflix. I'm lucky enough to do that. But the suffering thanks to lockdown (suicides, homelessness, poverty, financial struggle, mental health deterioration, missed treatments, domestic abuse and so the list goes on) and the taking away of our human rights does not seem ok to me. Not at all. Thanks to lockdown, more people don't even have a home never mind netflix. Tell me, do you see there being an exception for pandemics in our human rights? In previous pandemics, despite the fact that the diseases were more serious, we did not react in this way. The effects of whatever disease it was were obvious and serious to people first hand, not just through the news, which for the majority of people now seems to be the case. And do not compare this to a war. The horrors of a war are not remotely close to this. Those people fought and died for our rights and freedom, and yet you want to use their suffering and sacrafice to support taking those very things away? (even if temporarily, I agree it can get a bit bonkers around here sometimes which isn't great)</p>

        <p>those conscripted and forced to go to war lost their rights didn’t they? </p>
<p>Previous pandemics can’t spread as fast.... AND LASTED MUCH LONGER. </p>
<p>What rights? Omg you are insufferable, this whining you spew along with you compatriots is just insufferable. </p>
<p>Man up. It won’t last forever. Yeah sometimes things are tough but moaning about rights solves nothing. Yes there are ups and downs in life but if we let the virus run rampant how would it be better? IT WOULDNT. </p>
<p>Just stop whining about rights and man up. Wear the masks. Muck in. Get it done. A couple of years isn’t long, it would be even shorter if people paid attention to the rules cause vaccination doesn’t work immediately. I’ll just never understand the complaining, as if someone is doing this to you. THE WHOLE WORLD IS DOING THIS TOGETHER. But it seems like a set few complain about rights. </p>
<p>If this was war, you would probably say you weren’t going cause it’s a removal of your rights.</p>

        <p>If the threat was literally being bombed, rest assured I would see it as dangerous and act accordingly. At least during the war they weren't forcibly isolated in the general population. They could go and do things that helped take their mind off it. We cannot. Every day, everywhere we go or don't go, we're reminded of it. There's no escape, it's just constant. You know solitary confinement is one of the worst forms of punishment in prison? </p>
<p>Rights. Freedom of movement, freedom of peaceful gathering and association, freedom to leave and return to your own country, right to choose what healthcare interventions you take, right to work, right to choose work environment...just a few there.</p>
<p>We don't let the virus run rampant among everyone, heard of the <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">Great Barrington declaration </a> It has to be better than this, a potential solution with far less second order effects. It will also protect those at risk when herd immunity is achieved, and does not rely on a vaccine. </p>
<p>And following the restrictions does NOT make it end faster. I laugh when people say that. The restrictions are intended to <em>slow</em> the spread, which wouldn't you know it, prolong the suffering due to lockdown.</p>
<p>These restrictions are having a horrible effect on my mental health. I often feel suicidal, but sure "man up" right, because that helps. That's why I'm concerned. If this goes on for too much longer I will not make it out the other side. A couple years is a very long time.</p>
<p>And we are NOT all in this together. People are unfairly suffering while others are able to work from home, live with family, can afford zoom calls and have a bubble near them. People can stay in their nice big house with everything they want while other can barely afford rent thanks to not being able to work. Are the politicians following their own rules? No, many have been caught breaking them. Actions speak louder than words. They say we're all in this together, but their actions say we're not and that they don't think they have to follow the rules they force upon us.</p>
<p>You can call me selfish all you want but you ignore the suffering thanks to lockdown because what? It isn't on the news? There are other strategies. Nothing's perfect but it has to be better than this.</p>

        <p>To your first point, you can do things to take your mind off it lol like go for a walk, live in a house rather than a trench, watch tv, start a hobby, it’s unbelievable the way you make it sound like they had it easier lol</p>
<p>Choosing healthcare? Are you talking about masks? (If so, don’t be so pathetic). The freedom to leave and return to your own country is a 2 way street mate. And could you cry more about half losing some of them? My lord, muck in with everyone else. It’s really not that bad at all. </p>
<p>This one is stupid as fuck. The herd immunity one. This is virus dependent. A coronavirus spreads quickly and near undetected. Trying for herd immunity means literally sacrificing people. How can you be so selfish? ALSO maybe do some reading that isn’t biased? The virus can re infect you several months later, with a population as large and integrated as ours now, it would just continue to spread. </p>
<p>Following the restrictions will make the roll out of the vaccine faster. It’s like you are an actual pleb. Yes it was meant to slow the spread so hospitals aren’t overwhelmed and people don’t die... the. The vaccine comes and problem solved. The suffering would be MUCH greater if there was no lockdown, the deaths, the economy, it’s al modelled by experts, the information is there if you want to read it, but you carry on complaining </p>
<p>A couple of years isn’t a long time. Get a hobby. I Lost my dream job to the virus and the lockdowns, I’m not selfish enough to cry about it and claim the experts and science driven data are incorrect.</p>
<p>So your point about not being in this together actually implies that you would be happier to follow the rules if the politicians did lol yeah some have it worse than others, that’s inevitable. Other world wide disasters have the same effect, complaining won’t help.</p>
<p>There are other strategies.... apart from they tend for fail and too many people die. Please explain in detail how your other strategies would keep people alive? Or do you think your suffering should be solved at the cost of many peoples lives? Is that fair? Yeah the lockdowns aren’t nice but you need to get over it. There are also people worse of than you that aren’t complaining about “freedoms” like a pathetic child</p>
