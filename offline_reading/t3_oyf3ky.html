        <p>I have only read part one. This is why the govt et al around the world are scrambling. They have realised their numbers are wrong and are running scared. Scared  that people find out what is written here.  Now, I do not know who this doctor is or his pedigree but I will investigate him later when I read the second article. Oddly, this article is the closest I have come to thinking that maybe I will get the vax.  Gut instinct said to me, that after I retire is when the flu shot and this sort of vax would benefit me most, so I have a few years for them to get it working; it is why I am reluctant now. </p>
<p>&rt;    When “former Director of the CDC” Dr. Tom and others use the non-infection efficacy numbers to discuss the vaccines, they are, intentionally or not, misleading the public. It is something that should end immediately.</p>
<p>The other thing that has never been answered satisfactorily is WHY. Why is there such a push? There are hundreds of answers all as good or bad as the next, but none that is the truth as yet. All lies have a way of coming out, if above quote is <em>intentional</em>. </p>
<p>Why?</p>

        <p>This is a good breakdown of how incorrect and manipulated statistics are being used to universally promote the vaccine.</p>
<p>TLDR: in the recent Massachusetts outbreak the VACCINATED had a higher infection hospitalization rate than the UNVACCINATED</p>
