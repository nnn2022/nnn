    <strong>What I've Learned over the Past Year</strong>
    <p><p>What I've Learned over the Past Year:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Everything that Wikipedia, YouTube, and especially Facebook lists as a "conspiracy theory" is actually a fact. All "conpiracy theories" are true!</strong> They say that it's a conspiracy theory because "only mad loons believe that stuff, and you don't wanna be one of them!" While the anti-vaxxer and QAnon communities do need to act more professionally and not rant in all-caps every half-hour, they're not wrong on what they say.</li>
<li><strong>It is you against everybody else</strong>. I already knew this, but it really showed this past year and for the future remainder of civilization.</li>
<li><strong>Racism, bigotry and segregation are the natural orders of life</strong>. Have you ever seen a "diverse" or enforced "multicultural" civilization thrive for at least 150 years? I don't think so. Why do you think the left is promoting multiculturalism? Well, the college students in Massachusetts are just plain dumb, although it seems they think they are doing the right thing, while their zionist professors do it to make the population dumber.</li>
<li><strong>The autistic community, as a whole, is not "gifted," they're</strong> <strong><em>disabled</em></strong>. Disability does not mean "differently-abled" as many leftists will preach. Anything a disabled person (especially intellectually) can do, neurotypical people can do and do it better. Why do you think the government will continue to require more and more vaccines? Because that means more autistic children (and later autistic adults) that can easily be controlled and manipulated. At 21, they still live with mom and dad with a 5-year-old mentality, still watching Barney, Teletubbies, Thomas, and Elmo, may or may not be toilet trained, and has baseball-sized holes punched in their room from their hyena meltdowns.</li>
</ol>
<p>The leftists with aspergers (who comprise of most SJWs) who complain about Autism Speaks on Facebook and YouTube saying, "we don't need a cure!" are not aware that they are of the minority of the autistic community, true autistic community, that has average intelligence. A doctor once said that of the American babies born in 2032 (eleven years from now), 50% will have autism, with 80% of the boys.</p>
<p>The coming decades will be absolutely horrible. By 2050, most college-aged adults will have autism, 60% of those with an IQ below 70. Democrats will win every single national election, and if (God forbid) voting becomes mandatory, it will become automatic since there are more registered democrats than republicans in the USA. I hope, HOPE, that I don't live to see it.</p></p>

<li>
<p>That's what you think is the truth. You're just misled by the heaps of misinformation to a point where everyone who disagrees with you is lying. Sad. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't really disagree with that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So the reason you don't like the left is because they promote multiculturalism and the students are getting dumber because of it? That is just a very very racist thing to say. Fucked up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the autistic community have to do with this all. A lot of people are autistic. Wanna know why you don't see it? Because they are functioning human beings. I dont know enough about all the orgs and movements about it to comment on that but I don't see what that has to do with anything here. Unless you are implying that vaccines cause autism?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Autistic people don't have average intelligence. They can be very very stupid, like you are...or they can be highly intelligent. You clearly don't fucking know enough to be talking about this. Of course if you look through comments on FaceBook it's gonna be full of bs, that's just facebook. Yea right that "doctor" probably lost his license because he is an idiot.</p>
<p>I though that most dem voters are university educated. This must mean they are a tad intelligenter than the average right wing conspiracy nutjob lmao.</p>

<li>Thereâ€™s no proof for these movements and are bullshit and have been disproven.</li>
<li>Good!</li>
<li>The world has always been diverse and racism and bigotry have no place in our modern society</li>
<li>It is not a disability, it is a developmental disorder. Yes some cases of autism can be severe but I know a few people with autism and I wouldnâ€™t know it had they not told me. Autistic people donâ€™t need to be cured they are fine as is.</li>
<li>Thatâ€™s nonsense, a minority of autistic people have average intelligence. That doctor thing is most likely fake but send a source please</li>
<li>That wonâ€™t happen.  If voting becomes mandatory and democrats win due to more registers Democrats that alone shows the democrats are more popular with the people with the fact there are more Democrats than Republicans.</li>
