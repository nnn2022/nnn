        <p>I watched all of his presentations and agree with most of what he has said except for the idea of 'asymptomatic spread.' Decades' worth of research has proven that it's essentially nonexistent.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic spread is a thing, it's just not something you have to worry about around strangers unless you're making out with them.  So while a vaccinated person is much less likely to get symptoms from sars cov2 and spread it, the small percentage of people that do spread it could be spreading variants that have adapted around the vaccine induced immune response.</p>

        <p>They were saying that 60% of cases were spread asymptomatically. That's the biggest lie of this whole scam so you're right to be skeptical. I've read it's more like .7% but that still leaves a lot of possibilities.</p>

        <p>One would really have thought that we would have long-since discovered that asymptomatic spread was a meaningful contributor to pandemics and epidemics prior to 2020. To say that I am critical of every pro-C19 narrative ScIeNz from 2020 is an understatement.</p>

        <p>When have we ever done such mass intervention for a pandemic before? We are putting enormous evolutionary pressure on this virus when we should have left it alone. I believe C19 was made to be more pathogenic in a lab using gain of function technology. I believe everyone vaccinated will become a walking gain of function petri dish.</p>

        <p>I will attempt to summarize but I might mangle the details a bit. In the first half he covers that some people may have some level of natural immunity to the virus which causes them to be asymptomatic and still able to transmit the virus. Also that the virus, after it goes through the most vulnerable of the population basically remakes itself so it becomes more contagious amongst younger people, even if they have had it before. So the virus mutates so it can keep spreading because this is what they do to survive. The second half details why the mitigation efforts and vaccines have made it so much worse. First instead of burning through the population like wildfire we have prolonged the time in which the virus has to mutate. Second the vaccines are very specific to the particular strain in which they were programmed for and so if there is any variation it gives the virus the chance to escape the vaccine and become more infectious. This is  why they are saying people will need booster shots, they can still catch it and transmit it. In the end scientists will never be able to keep up with the mutations rendering these types of vaccines ineffective. So again I'm sure I mangled the explanation, I'd encourage people to watch it for themselves.</p>
