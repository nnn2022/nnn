    <strong>Masks Don't Work But We Should Still Wear Them</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sick and tired of people on this subreddit who are aware of the truth and yet take actions and use rhetoric that harm our cause. Yes, masks don't work and covid isn't really dangerous BUT the act of refusing to wear a mask in public spaces is ruining our message. Let me explain.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Let's start with a hypothetical. Would you point an unloaded gun at a stranger in public? Obviously you wouldn't. You can recognize the issue with that situation. While there is no present danger since the gun is unloaded, the recipient is uneducated on the unloaded status of the gun and feels threatened. While this is a little hyperbolic, but I believe it is similar to the act of not wearing a mask in public. The general public has been taught that this action is dangerous and feel threatened by it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now why is this harming our cause? Well people won't exactly hear us out if they feel threatened by us. That's pretty simple. In fact, displays like this will entrench the narratives in their heads, making it harder in the future for these people to be swung to our side despite all the science and evidence. People will just associate us as dangerous and careless people. It is extremely clear to me that entering walmart's without masks is actively limiting our outreach, and this hellish modern world won't change if our outreach is radicalizing the public against us.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, what should we do? Wear a mask but use it as a means to spread our message. Treat others with empathy, build trust, and educate them. Most people aren't so firmly entrenched into their beliefs that they can't be swayed, so take actions that will raise the odds of you convincing them. If you truly are against this new world order type government, then make sure your actions and rhetoric are actually fighting the system and changing minds. Don't just virtue signal about how you refuse to wear a mask.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I expect that this will be met with a lot of disagreement, so if you have thoughts on this, please tell me in the comments. I would like to think that I'm open to having my opinion changed and I'm also more than willing to expand on my beliefs if you wish to hear them.</p></p>

        <p>I recognize it's not your "job" or responsibility. But if you care enough to browse this subreddit, comment, and express your opinion here, then I assume you care about returning the world to some semblance of sanity. If you're comfortable with your actions hurting our cause because it's not your "job" to further your beliefs, that's fine but somehow I doubt you're actually comfortable with that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I understand your point with the video games and alcohol comments, but the narrative behind those things isn't really comparable to that of covid. The covid belief is FAR more widespread and is considered to represent a clear and present danger to people than any of the other examples you mentioned.</p>

        <p>I actually agree with you that coddling people got us here. I would've supported not wearing a mask way back before it was accepted as a necessary precaution by the general public. But at this point, it's a very different situation and I firmly believe that the act of not wearing a mask in places like grocery stores IS actively making things worse for us</p>

        <p>I'm not arguing it's your "job" or that you're morally obligated to do so. But I do think, if you want to actively fight this new normal, then this is the best course. Maybe I misunderstood this community but I was under the assumption that we were in someway trying to affect real world change rather than just talking in a forum.</p>

        <p>Well, me, all my family and friends have not gone along with any of these idiotic rules and mandates, (apart from the first two weeks) so everything is normal for us.</p>
<p>A store wants to deny me service because I refuse to wear a mask, cool, ill record the interaction and pass it on to the lawyers office across from my office who are taking these cases on pro bono, it actually hasn't happened to me yet which sucks because i would like some free money</p>

        <p>Comparing not wearing a mask with an unloaded gun being pointed at a person, even though you admit it's hyperbolic, is where you lost me. Talk about false equivalence! I'm sorry but I just cannot take the rest seriously because of that.</p>

        <p>I don't think they're like 1 to 1 comparable. The point is just that people can feel threatened in situations where there isn't any danger due to imperfect knowledge. That was just the most clear hypothetical to get that point across, and I don't think you should just write off my post as "crazy" because it had a slightly edge comparison.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this clear reply. I actually appreciate you trying to actually talk about this. I can see a lot of people disagree with me, but no one has given me a reason why yet, beyond the argument "it's not my job" which isn't actually something I disagree with. Could you tell me what you disagree with and why?</p>

        <p>People are very visual creatures. If they keep seeing masks then it becomes even more normal. They won't know that all those faces behind the masks actually disagree with the narrative, because wearing one automatically makes people assume that it's their choice to do so or that they are comfortable with it. How many strangers are okay with people coming up to them to talk about ANYTHING, let alone something that goes against the narrative? Not many - I certainly don't, if a stranger tries to talk to me I immediately have my guard up.</p>
<p>I think going maskless as much as possible, without causing a scene and being confrontational, just quietly getting on with your life, will be far more effective. That way, people will see that others are surviving without face coverings and that those naked faced people aren't disruptive, combative or rude.</p>
<p>As far as speaking to people, my approach is always to start with people closest to me and hope it spreads out organically.</p>
<p>I admit this is a passive approach and not for everyone - and maybe it will need to be ramped up to something more active in the future. As far as what that entails, I honestly don't have a clue.
The media is to blame for the narrative and until that's been exposed completely, we might just have a no-win situation on our hands sadly.</p>

        <p>Okay this is actually an incredibly well thought out answer and while I do think going maskless is harmful to the cause, I think you're doing your best to minimize that harm and you've thought out your position which seems to be more than I can say for most people in the world.</p>
<p>I think you're spot on about seeing masks everywhere normalizes it, but that ship has sailed. It's too late to fight that fight at this point, as they have been completely normalized a full year later. </p>
<p>Talking to strangers about it IS difficult, you're very right there. That's why forums like this are important for spreading our ideas. I do believe we can spread the message in person to people however that would require a whole tactics conversation. It sounds like speaking to the people close to you is a very good way of handling it though, and it's great that you're trying to educate people. You're also right that the media is to blame, which is one reason our actions should be directed counter to the narrative and media, rather than in a way that is considered antagonistic to those around us.</p>

        <p>If we all agree to wear the mask, then they move on to the next thing. Should we just accept the forced closure of our businesses? Should we accept not being able to visit with family/friends, or to travel? Should we accept mandatory vaccinations? Should we accept our freedom of speech being taken away?</p>
<p>No. They need to see that people are living normally and are doing well. Then they will have to ask themselves if they still want to live as a slave.</p>
