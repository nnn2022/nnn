        <p>It's the whole picture tho. Firstly a lot of the vaccinated coming into hospital are immuno comprised, doesn't seem like the vaccines work for them, so the only way to protect them is to bring overall numbers down.</p>
<p>Secondly, unvaxxed population going to hospital in droves will effect healthcare for everyone. When people said "was covid worth cancelling people operations for?", It's misleading. It's not possible to run a hospital effectively when you have a chunk of very sick infectious people. There's not enough space or staff, and not safe for someone to have critical surgery when they could catch covid after</p>

<p>How many are the immuno-compromised? Is all of society to sacrifice their freedoms for this vulnerable group? From a utilitarian perspective, you're going to diminish the happiness of the vast majority for the supposed benefit of a few? What if an immuno-compromised person is obese, should a society care for their health more than that individual cares for their own health? It has never been the collective's responsibility to ensure the survival of the most vulnerable. Else we would be caring the homeless, those with diabetes, and disabled veterans. But they are discarded and disregarded, left to die and rot on the streets. Yet we care more for some 80 year old retiree when they die of a flu-like disease?</p>

<p>You can have make-shift hospitals specifically for COVID patients, (as they have done before but were disbanded from misuse). You don't have to mix general hospital patients with COVID patients.</p>

<p>No I don't think everyone should abandon their freedoms for a vulnerable group. But does wearing a mask in public places and having a vaccine with a much higher safety margin than getting the disease really abandoning your freedoms?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'd be very surprised if you have healthcare knowledge. Not only is it very difficult to open new hospitals just for covid patients, and managing logistically with infection control, there's only a relatively small pool of staff to take from. In the UK the "nightingale" hospitals were barely used, because staff and patients were blocked in main hospitals. If someone comes in and is very sick, often they're too sick to move elsewhere, or use a lot of resources in the process</p>

        <p>With masks you give up your right to breathe air freely, to see facial expressions, to communicate non-verbally, and for what? They don't even work. </p>
<p>With vaccines you give up your right to bodily autonomy to a criminal organization, and they also don't work. You can still get infected as much as if you weren't vaccinated. Getting injected sets a precedent where global oligarchs can inject you with whatever experimental drug, for whatever reason.  </p>
<p>I admit I don't know all the logistics of running a hospital, but we should operate under the principal, to protect the vulnerable and let herd immunity take its course within the healthy. Just as Sweden has proven that that is the most effective way to mitigate the virus and it's economic impacts.</p>

        <p>Again, masks do work, and it's a small trade off compared to catching and spreading covid.</p>
<p>The vaccines DO work. There's a wealth of evidence supporting the fact they work. Look at any European country with rising cases and compare the death rate to previous waves. Hugely down. Hospitalisations hugely down.</p>
<p>Yeah but their IS a good reason to get vaccinated. There's over a 1000x more likely chance of dying from covid than their is vaccinations. People talk about the governments "agenda", maybe it's to not have citizens die, not have them do for sick or be stuck in hospital which both cripples the economy</p>

        <p>What country is the poster child for mask compliance? Japan? S. Korea? They still have their problems. Masks might suspend waves, but they are still dealing with COVID. </p>
<p>Maybe the virus was more lethal last year, because viruses lose their lethality over time, and become more contagious over time. Maybe the vulnerable people died off last year, and so we have a smaller pool of vulnerable people this year. A 30 year old, has a near 0% chance of dying from COVID, you are talking about death rates, well you must take in age and comorbidities into account. The only people who should really worry about COVID are people over 70, who aren't really part of the economy. </p>
<p>"People talk about the governments "agenda", maybe it's to not have citizens die, not have them do for sick or be stuck in hospital which both cripples the economy"</p>
<p>Lol. Our benevolent overlords care for us so much, they just want us to be safe.Truly though, they hate their citizens.</p>

        <p>I've seen plenty of younger people die mate. Not just over 70s. You even state they help suspend waves, but they don't work?</p>
<p>I honestly don't understand why the vaccine and covid in general is so political. You talk about governments using it for political benefit (which they have), but don't realise you're doing the exact same. Being anti covid is a part of your identity like. Just weird</p>
