        <p>As a member of that youth, I concur that a lot of our generation is extremely gullible. People in the U.S. are already more gullible and susceptible to propagandization from the media than most, but the youth in the U.S. is insufferably gullible. At least the older generations of the U.S. that the youth dismissively sneers as "boomers" yearn for some sort of return to what life was like previously, and exhibit an ounce of rejection towards this "new normal". The anti-social lemmings of the youth, meanwhile, seem to not only flourish in this remote environment, but actively contribute to its continuity, all while their friends and family slowly disassociate themselves with the youth's miserable, vapid existence.</p>

        <p>I completely agree. Who cares if there's a microchip in the vaccine anyway? It's horrible, but smartphones, computers, smart watches, and pretty much anything handheld with a Wi-Fi connection overtly serves the same purpose that any "microchip" would.</p>
<p>What I fear most of all is the potential of getting sterilized from this vaccine. I am not an anti-vaxxer and believe in the efficacy of most vaccines, but there is plenty of reason to believe that this vaccine in particular is not to be trusted. Why would I trust a vaccine that was made in a tenth of the time that most other vaccines have been developed, and is pushed by the same media outlets that believe a crappily sewn-together flower pattern cloth mask is a sufficient means of stopping this virus? Until I see unquestionable evidence that this vaccine will not sterilize people upon taking it, or will only sterilize people in the most inopportune circumstances, I am not taking it, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Sterilization is the least of what you have to worry about. This vaccine skipped animal trials but RNA vaccines have been tested on animals before they either got tumors or had auto-immune disorders that basically caused their bodies to overheat and then die fighting the disease the disease they were fighting was covid what the vaccine is support to vaccinate you against  the disease that they HAD a 99.999 chance of surviving.</p>

        <p>Yea, it is crazy whatever their masters say and they will do it. A few think it will lead to things going back to "normal" but I think you know that will never happen.</p>

        <p>You respond by telling them that there isn't enough technology in the world to put up their asses until they will be allowed to freely wobble around on festivals on drugs lying in eachother arms. That's the thing: People who will get vaccinated might enjoy more freedoms than us but they also will never get their pre-covid freedoms back, and also will only be allowed to exist in heavily controlled environments</p>
