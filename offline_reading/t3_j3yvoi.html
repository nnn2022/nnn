    <strong>I think we are in this position because people are too afraid to take risks.</strong>
    <p><p>All people are different and that’s okay. I’ve always been more of a risk taker, and other people aren’t. There’s nothing wrong with playing it safe most of the time. People have families and other assets and don’t want to lose them. I understand. I’m pregnant and married so I’ve been careful with all things. I’m in a position where it’s more than just myself I have to think about. </p>
<p>I think Doomers need to realize that there’s a risk in just being alive. People like me are not afraid of those risks because they are so small. Yeah, I could get shot if I go to the store if some crazy person decides to shoot it up, but if I don’t go to the store I’ll die of starvation and that’s more likely than the first scenario. Their solution to that problem is to ban guns, or make them harder to get, instead of protecting themselves and not infringing on the rights of other citizens.</p>
<p>It’s the same with covid. These people are afraid so they expect other people to bend over backwards for them. I do not like that. I’m sorry but you have to accept the risk of getting it when you go out. You can’t demand that people wear masks, not have parties, and close countless businesses and services because you are afraid. If you’re afraid, you wear an N95 or other good mask, you wear gloves, you do whatever you want. You cannot force other people to do all those things to cater to your fear.</p></p>

        <p>Indeed. It's so strange how many people are showing their authoritarian stance lately. Something non covid related, but my hometown was recently affected by the fires in California. Many people lost their homes. Suddenly, people are floating the idea that we shouldn't be allowed to live in the mountains in  California because the fires are inevitable and need to happen for the health of the forest. The latter is true, but we live in fucking California, a massive earthquake can happen at any moment. Forcing all us rural folk here to leave the mountains to go live in the  cities because "it's safer" in regards to natural disasters is some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard. I've been dumbfounded this idea is legitimately floating around and that people in the  city near me are putting this out there as a solution. It's a thinly veiled "I know better than you, you shouldn't be allowed to take that risk, you shouldn't be able to live where you grew up cuz I said so." </p>
<p>End rant.</p>

        <p>I concur. They don't even know how to read their own studies. I read a study from a doomer that said 40-80% of infections come from pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic people. I look over it thoroughly and it ended up being a study that combined two different groups of a total of 238 people. One group of 93 people and another group of 135. Didn't mention any deaths in the first group and in the second only 3 deaths out of 135.</p>
<p>The second didn't mention whether or not they even died specifically of covid or even how they got in the hospital, if they had underlying conditions or comorbidities they just mentioned 3 died before the study ended. I had to laugh! Now get this....the pre-symptomatic people had an IFR of 0.6 to 0.8 and somehow the study concludes, after admitting they have to make a shit ton of assumptions due to the fact that there is missing data, i.e. not following up with everyone discharged from the hospital etc. and they came up with a possibility of 65% of those in the study <strong><em>likely</em></strong> infected others, LMAO.</p>
<p>I'm like "SERIOUSLY?!" WTF?! How the hell do you come up with that with a.) such a small sample size? b.) with all that freakin missing data? Clown world bro, their own studies can't even overhype this!</p>

        <p>Courtesy of the pernicious philosophy of "it takes a village", which has infested society over the last 30 years or so, we have devolved in  the following manner:</p>
<p>From dealing with risk being a personal responsibility, to "risk management", to risk aversion, to an obsession with eliminating <em>all</em> risk. Hence you see ridiculous scenarios like "caution! HOT!!!" labels on coffee cups, outside workers trussed up in reflective vests in broad daylight, blinding disco-strobe lights on a 15 foot tall orange school bus,10000 students banned from eating peanut butter because 1 student is allergic, etc, etc.</p>
<p>The blanket mask mandates and other stupidities forced down everyone's throats because of WuFlu are a natural extension of this mindset - that somehow <em>I</em> am responsible to ensure <em>you</em> are not exposed to any of life's risks.</p>
<p>It's the antithesis of personal liberty - making me a slave to someone else's irrational fear...</p>

        <p>I totally agree. Western culture especially, has big fear of death and sickness. Old people die in hospitals, in clinical settings, because we as society are too distanced from death and sickness as part of life. 
Nobody wants their close ones to die, but we cannot let fear decide how we live our life. As u said, risks, accidents, death and sickness, are all natural and unavoidable. It is an illusion they try to cater to.</p>

<p>Ah, but you can.  You see that's the advantage of a powerful government. In any sane society, no, you couldn't.  But  when the majority backs (wants, desires) anything, the government is there to give it to them.  Even if the government itself has created the desire. </p>
<p>The only way to prevent any government from abusing power is to not give that power in the first place.  There is no other way.  Government will trend to exercise power the ways flies trend to shit. </p>
<p>We lost this battle long ago when we conceded that government had the right to tell us to "buckle up for safety".  When we acceded to showing a picture ID to get on a plane or get a library card.  When we admitted that police could pull over cars on the road "on suspicion". People who believe there is no "slippery slope" simply don't see it because we are already right at the bottom.</p>

<p>This one just has me perplexed.  Why is this subject avoided like the (shit, pun not intended) plague?  </p>
<p>If we could, we would certainly be advising people to get younger, right?  Being under 40 years makes your risk minimal.  But we can't make people younger.  We can't advise people to be under 250 lbs, or 35 BMI  because.... I'm at a loss.  We could do that. People could do that.</p>

        <p>The two easiest groups of people to control are those are angry, and those who are scared.  Anger pushes you to action and hampers your ability to think clearly.  Fear pushes you to inaction and hampers your ability to think at all.  Those who seek socially-enabled power need only choose their desired flavor, and the panic can begin.</p>
<p>Here's a fun little experiment: take the doomers you know personally.  Head back through their social media postings to the second week of January, 2015.  Count the number of "Je suis Charlie" postings you see.  Then flash forward to this March and see how honest that claim turns out to be when they're called upon to actually risk something.</p>

        <p>The thing about all of this is not that people are afraid of a small risk. The issue is that people have been brainwashed into thinking it's a much more serious risk than it actually is. So, it's not necessarily an irrational fear, because the information the fear is based on is not correct information or it is being taken out of context and people don't ask enough questions.</p>
<p>At worst, this disease is just a serious flu. And don't get me wrong, the flu is no joke. But we know already who are most at risk for complications from these types of sicknesses. People have been getting the flu as long as people have existed.</p>

        <p>I'm not a risk taker in the sense of being impulsive, but I am very distrustful of authority. It's been really disillusioning to see how many people who think of themselves as rebels just blindly swallowed the covid narrative pushed by the media, then scolded and mocked anyone who questioned it.</p>

        <p>No shit. But I think it's more the politicians and scientists who are risk averse. As for the bedsetters forcing everyone else to participate in their zombie apocalypse role play, I think a lot of it is that they would fear to look stupid were they the few going along with it. And when you have control of the narrative you're not going to let that happen.</p>
