    <strong>The USA is going to Hell after the Rona allowed the election to be stolen</strong>
    <p><p>Like many Americans, I’ve reached a boiling point over how quickly this country is being handed over to the control structure who wants to enslave the middle class. </p>
<p>Inflation, war, crisis (border, fuel, virus control) all have gotten drastically worse since mail in voting and usage of soros voting systems in loose states ie MI, PA, AZ, NV, GA allowed 4am software vote dumps, restriction of poll watchers-one instance a “water main break” forcing GA republican poll watchers out the building (turns out didn’t happen), rona mail in voting, etc etc etc. </p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence of no “Biden” support with his 1.5% primary candidate Kamala shielded by MSM and the virus-low views on YT and speeches that get 1/4 of obama viewers. YET they got more votes than any candidate in history?! </p>
<p>This election was stolen. The USA and the World is going to hell. And it’s only 100 days into the sham administration. </p>
<p>It’s going to get worse. </p>
<p>We need to stick together and take it to the streets! Never forget there’s more of us than them. Yes we all need to work to survive and most just go through the daily motions-but we have to unite and say “forget about getting up at 6am, get coffee, go to work, grocery, cook dinner, sleep and repeat” </p>
<p>This is WAR!</p></p>

        <p>Unfortunately it’s going to take major pain for people in this country to wake up. As of right now the media is propping up Biden and covering for the disaster which is keeping a little more then half the country placated and still congratulating themselves on how they got rid of bad orange man. But even the brain dead moderates will have to acknowledge things are really wrong once they are personally affected which will probably happen soon.</p>

        <p>No, because the election isn't decided by popular vote. It's decided by the electoral college and therefore ~40,000 votes in three states, all of which instituted illegal, unilateral voting changes using COVID as an excuse and flooded the states with mail-in ballots. They then used COVID as an excuse for why they couldn't use standard verification or interested party observation of signature checking or vote counting.</p>

        <p>So if I understand your thought process, the majority of America voted against Trump but it is impossible that that majority vote shook out for slightly bigger wins in Philly, Atlanta, Detroit and Phoenix than in 16?</p>

<p>To be honest, if they only need 40k votes its probably cheaper, easier and less traceable to just buy those votes than to jump through all the hoops necessary to pull off all the shannanagans that the regularly laid out conspiracies would require.</p>

        <p>I disagree. One of the keys to communication (at least for me) and debate is reprase, repeate and clerify.</p>
<p>You threw out the number of votes that swung. I provided context to how those votes would have been applied in the election and how that would swing vs the previous narrow election.</p>
<p>There is no strawman in the slightest, I'm looking to take your claim and apply it to the known facts of the election.</p>

        <p>I did not throw out a number of votes that "swung," I wrote the number of votes which decided the outcome of the election in three states. I then listed reasons to doubt the legitimacy of this number of votes; mass mail-in ballots which were mailed out, collected, and counted based on illegal, unilaterally imposed regulations by Democrat Secs of State using COVID as an excuse who then also removed or refused to enforce verification procedures in their collection, their custody, their counting, and their recording, as well as removed interested independent party observers to stop them from observing or contesting these ballots based on the alleged verification requirements in place.</p>

        <p>Fair enough.  If these votes are to be doubted because of the reasons listed, what would your want be for a solution? It doesn't sound like you think it's impossible that trump would have lost without the mail in changes, but you don't think the election results are legit or at least complete.</p>
<p>So what do we do now?</p>

        <p>I feel the same way about the pandemic, thus my fascination with this sub. </p>
<p>To set the stage: I fully belive in covid, I don't think it's just a cold. I wear a mask when in people's places of business. That said, I have no fear of it, I go out. I meet people we have people over, we've moved across the country and I've been on 30 or so flights in the last 1.5 years.</p>
<p>For this to be a "plandemic" would require all the nation's leaders and media to all coordinate for the same goal. If that goal is to poison the population with the vaccine, wouldn't there be methods that are significantly easier? Let's say they push the narrative of a bad flu season and poison the annual flu shot. They could have avoided all the rest of the efforts over the last bit of time. Not to mention I in no way, belive that many people can coordinate for the same secret outcome.</p>
<p>What's your take on the goal of the plandemic?</p>

        <p>The election being stolen is ultimately a fallacy because <strong>presidents are predetermined.</strong></p>
<p>They are puppets to the federal reserve. In Trump's case, he was equivalent to a WWE superstar who managed to play the hero and heel simultaneously. If he said one thing, 100 million+ Liberals would do the opposite. He controlled half the country through reverse psychology. </p>
<p>The only reason the Right has any reason to believe Trump is one of the "good guys" is because the MSM painted him as one in their 24/7 attacks of him for four years straight. Essentially another form of control via reverse psychology. When people say never to trust what you see on TV, that includes the MSM's supposed disdain for Trump.</p>
<p>What it comes down to is the Left and Right being the same exact body, created for the sole purpose of dividing and conquering. The illusion exists that they are different for the sake of maintaining control of 330 million people. </p>
<p>With Trump, the elite managed to get their biggest threat, the armed population, to support government in a way we've never seen before. It's genius really. </p>
<p>The question boils down to which is worse:</p>
<p>Leftists openly gobbling down blue pills or the Right pompously swallowing blue pills that are <em>painted</em> red?</p>

        <p>One thing you can do to at least kind of help is to stop buying products made in China. Obviously, there are tons of other issues but this is at least one we have some control over.</p>

        <p>Elections have been stolen since their inception in this country. Every President is related to each other with the exception of Martin Van Buren. Seriously you paradigm believers, especially Trump supporters need to wake the fuck up. </p>
<p>No politician is going to save you so quit buying into the left/right nonsense. It's complete bullshit.</p>
