    <strong>Theories as to what is actually going on</strong>
    <p><p>Curious to hear people theories as to why we are being forced to adopt the new normal? To make it easier to control us yes, but why??</p></p>

        <p>We are like cattle to the global planners. Our free lives and free will are a nightmare for them.  They know best and you will never convince them otherwise.  If you go back and read progressive writings from the late 1800s and early 1900s you will see they have wanted a planned society all along. We are an expendable resource.  Ever wonder why when you watch the news we are referred to as workers?  Because we aren’t individuals with lives to them. They hate us. They have hated us because they could not control us.  This virus gives them a way to control us to reign us in.  And they have dumbed down so many people they actually have a shot.  My morale fluctuates.  Some days I’m defeated and think fuck it all.  But having found this sub and knowing I’m not the only one bolsters my resolve.  I don’t know if we will win big picture. But the earth is large and they can’t control every square inch.  They suffer from the sin of pride and they think they are invincible and all powerful.  But they are as fallible and human as anyone else.  I think very dark times are coming. I pray for us all.  I love you guys.  Keep fighting and resisting.</p>

        <p>One possible angle is that there are outside interests that are manipulating platforms to give power to fringe and/or self-interested groups. There are allegations of Chinese misconduct in this to sway Italian opinion. Once Italy fell, so did the rest of the West. Note: this is not an entire world thing or just an American thing. It's a West thing, and who are our enemies? Who stands to gain from the West falling?</p>
<p>I think the new normal is less about control and more about eventual chaos and collapse.</p>

<p>The Ford Foundation and Borealis Philanthropy recently announced the formation of the <a href="https://www.borealisphilanthropy.org/#!black-led-movement-fund/yepdg">Black-Led Movement Fund [BLMF]</a>, a six-year pooled donor campaign aimed at raising $100 million for the Movement for Black Lives coalition.</p>
<p>That funding comes in addition to more than $33 million in grants to the Black Lives Matter movement from top Democratic Party donor <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/george-soros/">George Soros</a> through his Open Society Foundations, as well as grant-making from the Center for American Progress.</p>
<p>You know the biggest joke of it all ? When you donate on the BLM communist website, it goes to ActBlue, the democratic party funding arm... I mean, that's as clear cut as it gets. China ain't behind the communism push in the US, the global deep state is.</p>

        <p>I can't give any particular agent credit in this whole shift on civility. </p>
<p>What I see are nations of people educated in systems funded by corporations that have squashed critical thinking, and no child left behind has become no moron left behind. </p>
<p>Public funded jobs are filled with lots of people funneled from state universities that propagandize rather than educate. Many graduates secretly know they didn't learn shit all through school, and now they need to hide this fact to protect their wages. When any task that involves controlling other people falls into the laps of these under qualified public servants, it's their first chance to feel important and flex their "authority". They tend to have weak egos that can't stand admitting mistakes because they have been living so many lies for so long anyway.</p>
<p>I see this explanation fit all the way up to the likes of Fauci, Cuomo, etc., and certainly on every county and city commission, board of health, you get my meaning by now....</p>

        <p>global fascism. The world is run by psychopaths and this is their religion. The earth has been running as a human farm for millennia, and there is currently a turning of the world order. These are natural cycles that few people know about, but over time the ruling class have worked them out and learned how to harness them. They are trying to engineer a situation where they remain on top of the pyramid after the dust settles at the end of this turning. They are pathological; they want to enslave the whole world forever, and they think they can actually make that happen. Never mind how many times fascism/communism/socialism has collapsed under the weight of its own idiocy; as the saying goes, insanity is repeating the same actions over and over and expecting a different result. Yet here we are again.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that this situation is possible is that the general population are ritually brain damaged as children. These psychopaths have discovered that certain types of abuse and indoctrination, when applied at a certain young age, give them backdoor access into people's minds, rendering them suggestible through various manipulation techniques. This brain damage is installed culturally - virally - so that once it is endemic in a population, it runs on its own power from parent to child without the need for them to do this work themselves. The only thing required from them to hold people in this state perpetually is to inflict mass trauma on the population at certain intervals (ie war, etc), because without this intervention the human population would spiritually heal after a certain number of generations. If you want to know more about this, read more about the narcissist/codependent dynamic; psychopathy; look up the word wetiko; read about vampires (or honestly, watch the blade movies. psychopaths are born vampires; narcissists are bitten/turned vampires; codependents are their food; and there are also vampire hunters, those who escaped this abusive system somehow; "day walkers" from the blade films, these would be like healed codependents). They are all referring to this system of generational trauma-based brainwashing/ mind control. Learn about manipulation techniques used by psychopaths and narcissists, then compare these to religion and government, and you will see this abusive indoctrination and how it works.</p>
<p>this is my interpretation of a high level view of deep history and the central problem with society for the last few thousand years. It's somewhat of my personal theory, based on the fact that once you understand condependency and narcissism, and psychopathy, you find that these groups of mentally stunted people make up the vast majority of the population, and that mentally healthy people are quite rare. The same type of abuse creates both narcissism and codependency, depending on the age of the trauma and the spiritual/mental constitution of the recipient of this trauma, and both codependents and narcissists unconsciously inflict this trauma on their children, as they are more or less two sides of the same coin. These people also happen to be the easily manipulable segment of the population (sheep) that easily fall prey to propaganda and fascism, which conveniently also inflicts great trauma to the society as a whole as well as sweeps up the dissenters (healed people) and exterminates them. Thus you can see how humans are farmed and selectively bred for their compliant attributes (domesticated).</p>
