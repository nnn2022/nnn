    <strong>Was Trump controlled opposition this whole time? (hindsight)</strong>
    <p><p>idiots throwing out the insult "trump supporters" and "anti-vaxxers" as if they're one and the same, dont know what the fuck they're talking about and should not be taken seriously, that's for sure, but if we look into the events of 2020, by all visible measures, Trump aided the Chinese Flu at every stage, even creating a new czar post for Fauci.</p>
<p>In reality framing pandemic skeptics as Trumpers is just one more chilling technique, designed to keep citizens from expressing our shared concerns.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it more, Trump seemed to be another controlled opposition. Don't get the idea that he was "opposition" to the government, he, along with Beijing Biden are two talking heads from the same enemy (similar to a hydra having multiple heads), he was an effective way to cause even more division between the public. Fuck him. Don't trust either Trump or dementia Biden because they're both on team government (the hydra in question). Trump served his purpose well because now they have an extra way to cause more division than ever before</p>
<p>if trump was truly anti-government he'd have done much more to help (or would've likely gotten assassinated already, <strong>lets be real here, the elites are smart, and assuming Trump was on our side, its one man against the elites and he can easily be put down, they have the capabilities</strong>).</p>
<p>It sucks too, and I feel incredibly betrayed and upset after looking at it in hindsight, but he was not a hero, just another disappointment. As I'm typing this post I'm still really upset and feel like i was duped...</p>
<p>Shame :(</p></p>

        <p>It's hard to say. I think it's possible that he was initially being genuine. Or at least as genuine as a Machiavellian personality can be. I'm pretty sure he mainly entered the race out of sheer spite. And spite is one of the most powerful forces in existence, especially when it's being amplified by a mad lad with functionally unlimited resources. He may or may not have expected to win, but either way, he certainly caused a pretty significant disruption to the status quo.  </p>
<p>But even if he was initially trying to fuck with the establishment, it's entirely possible, and even probable, that they got to him at some point during his presidency. Couldn't say precisely how. As stubborn and crafty as the guy is, he's far from invincible. I reckon he was (and remains) protected from brazen assassination attempts, somewhat ironically, <em>because</em> of his notoriety - if he had been assassinated during his term, it would have turned him into a martyr, which I don't think would have been something that the establishment would have been able to keep a leash on. As for now...well, I reckon if he did get "flipped", protection would have been part of the deal.  </p>
<p>Truth of things like this is usually somewhere in the middle. I tend to think he got into it primarily due to a combination of spite and an insatiable amount of ambition. Secondarily, he may or may not have wanted to disrupt the establishment. But, either way, towards the end, it's entirely likely that the establishment got to him somehow (question mark as to how), and forced him to bend the knee.  </p>
<p>Although...that does still seem to be rather elaborate. Especially without any direct evidence. But, there's all sorts of outlandish chicanery these days. Anything seems possible at this point here in Clown World.</p>

        <p>Great way to frame it as a hydra! </p>
<p>This has always been the rules and anyone trying to obtain power or control aka taking the throne has a set of rules to follow. https://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs this is a video that explained to me how systems of power work both democracies and dictatorships.  </p>
<p>You can rest assured the only people coming into power are those who are approved by the previous power.</p>

        <p>I generally don't think this is true. Many of his policies were better for America. Monetary and pride together, he was pro America in vision. That isn't controlled opposition, that's the right way to live life imo.</p>
