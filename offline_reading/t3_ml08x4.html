    <strong>Listened to pro-quarantine reddit's arguements, now listening to this one.</strong>
    <p><p>Hello! I come from the part of reddit that is pro-quarantine and such. I've heard their arguements for quarantine, and now I'm willing to listen this subreddit's arguements against it.</p>
<p>Pro-Maskers welcome to listen in and argue as well,<br>
Lets have a civilised arguement here, shall we? After all, we can't convince people without talking calmly.</p></p>

        <p>Florida has a higher percentage of elderly people than all other states, except Maine.</p>
<p>Florida only had a very short lockdown long ago and yet, their numbers as far as cases and deaths is consistently better than all other states that enforced extensive lockdowns and mask mandates. </p>
<p>Consequently, Florida's economy is doing well and their citizens aren't suffering from any substantial increases in social problems associated with lockdowns such as drug overdoses, suicides, domestic violence, etc..</p>

        <p>Agreed. Many more people should take a multi-vitamin multi-mineral everyday and do a better job of staying hydrated; they'd probably feel a bit better whether there's a pandemic taking place or not.</p>

        <p>A few people have already posted some damning points. I think it would be useful for you to respond, or to phrase an argument in the comments in favor for quarantine (keep in mind that some people don’t believe the numbers that are reported are accurate, so only use data that can be sufficiently substantiated).</p>
<p>Further, most people here are fine with other people using masks, the debate is whether everyone MUST use a mask. There is not strong research that supports that masks are efficient, and published scientific research that posits that masks not effective.</p>
<p>So please, frame your argument, there is a plethora on this sub of other people making theirs</p>

        <p>Oh, totally.  I have just never really considered the idea but it's kind of awesome.</p>
<p>I have studied a bit of Roman empire history and remember the sources being kind of random in terms of what survives.  "Here is what we can learn about the ancient Roman mindset via this shop keeper's invoice".</p>
<p>But this comment history is on a whole new level.</p>

        <p>The real crux of the argument philosophically is about personal freedom. Practically the argument revolves around wether other economic and social cost is worth the human cost. Which is an unfortunate but necessary experience in national accounting.</p>

        <p>My argument is simple: regardless of whether or not you believe the numbers being reported, we've taken a disturbing step toward totalitarianism and the death of human freedom that no amount of cases or deaths would justify in my view.</p>
<p>Obviously people have died and that's tragic, but we can't let the solution be worse than the problem. We also need to consider the precedent this is setting for future generations and their liberty, which is horrific.</p>

        <p>We have ourselves a real nasty quandary rife with nuance and concerns over other people's feelings and needs.</p>
<p>Growing up I was always told that my rights end where the next person's nose begins. The same, I would hope, ought be said in turn.</p>
<p>I wish that people would accept concern for their own well-being without forcing others to abide by rules they themselves are not in agreement with. Taking responsibility for oneself is the first step to this becoming okay again.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna' tell other people how to live their life. I respect their intelligence and self determination too much to do that. I would appreciate the same courtesy.</p>

        <p>You should be anti-lockdown because to be pro-lockdown is to throw decades of epidemiology out the window:</p>
<p>New England Journal of Medicine: 2.8% of recruits tested positive after 14 days of military-enforced quarantine, compared to 1.7% of recruits in the control grouphttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2029717</p>
<p>The Lancet Journal:</p>
<p>“Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, and wide-spread testing were not associated with COVID-19 mortality per million people.” https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30208-X/fulltext</p>
<p>American Institute for Economic Research:</p>
<p>“It was pure speculation that lockdowns would suppress this virus, and that speculation was based on a hubristic presumption of the awesome power and intelligence of government managers.”
“Based on the data, there seems to be no relationship between lockdowns and lives saved.”</p>
<p>https://www.aier.org/article/the-virus-doesnt-care-about-your-policies/</p>
<p>Aarhus University:</p>
<p>“Using two indices from the Blavatnik Centre’s Covid 19 policy measures and comparing weekly mortality rates from 24 European countries in the first halves of 2017-2020, and addressing policy endogeneity in two different ways, I find no clear association between lockdown policies and mortality development.”https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3665588</p>
<p>Frontiers in Public Health Study:</p>
<p>“Stringency of the measures settled to fight pandemia, including lockdown, did not appear to be linked with death rate.” https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604339/full#SM6</p>

<p>Tel Aviv University:</p>
<p>“We would have expected to see fewer Covid-19 fatalities in countries with a tighter lockdown, but the data reveals that this is not the case” https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128520v1</p>
<p>Cornell University:</p>
<p>“A Bayesian inverse problem approach applied to UK data on COVID-19 deaths and the disease duration distribution suggests that infections were in decline before full UK lockdown”
https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02090</p>
<p>Journal of Behavioural Economics for Policy:</p>
<p>“The response to COVID-19 has been overwhelmingly to lockdown much the world’s economies in order to minimize death rates as well as the immediate negative effects of COVID-19. I argue that such policy is too often de-contextualized as it ignores policy externalities, assumes death rate calculations are appropriately accurate and, and as well, assumes focusing on direct Covid-19 effects to maximize human welfare is appropriate. As a result of this approach current policy can be misdirected and with highly negative effects on human welfare. Moreover, such policies can inadvertently result in not minimizing death rates (incorporating externalities) at all, especially in the long run.”</p>
<p>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3607803</p>
<p>New Zealand Economic Papers Journal:</p>
<p>“Lockdowns do not reduce Covid-19 deaths. This pattern is visible on each date that key lockdown decisions were made in New Zealand. The apparent ineffectiveness of lockdowns suggests that New Zealand suffered large economic costs for little benefit in terms of lives saved.”https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00779954.2020.1844786</p>
<p>Advance Study:</p>
<p>“In a recent article, Flaxman et al. allege that non-pharmaceutical interventions imposed by 11 European countries saved millions of lives. We show that their methods involve circular reasoning. The purported effects are pure artefacts, which contradict the data. Moreover, we demonstrate that the United Kingdom’s lockdown was both superfluous and ineffective”

<p>British Medical Journal:</p>
<p>“Harms of public health interventions against covid-19 must not be ignored”</p>
<p>“Interventions to limit the spread of the coronavirus also carry negative health effects, which have yet to be considered systematically. Despite increasing evidence on the unintended, adverse effects of public health interventions such as social distancing and lockdown measures, there are few signs that policy decisions are being informed by a serious assessment and weighing of their harms on health.”</p>
<p>“In the US, delays in screening and treatment are estimated to cause 250 000 additional preventable deaths of cancer patients each year”</p>
<p>“In England, the weekly number of hospital admissions for coronary syndromes fell by 40% between mid-February and the end of March 2020. Fear of exposure to the virus stopped many patients from attending hospital, putting them at increased risk of long term complications of myocardial infarction”</p>
<p>“A “zero covid” goal is neither realistic nor sustainable for most countries.”</p>
<p>https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4074</p>
<p>British Medical Journal:</p>
<p>“Only a third of the excess deaths seen in the community in England and Wales can be explained by covid-19”

<p>Journal of Epidemiology:</p>
<p>“Epidemic theory dictates that a reduction in the force of infection by a pathogen is associated with an increase in the average age at which individuals are exposed. For those pathogens that cause more severe disease among hosts of an older age, interventions that limit transmission can paradoxically increase the burden of disease in a population.”</p>
<p>“The link between limiting pathogen exposure and improving public health is not always so straightforward. Reducing the risk that each member of a community will be exposed to a pathogen has the attendant effect of increasing the average age at which infections occur. For pathogens that inflict greater morbidity at older ages, interventions that reduce but do not eliminate exposure can paradoxically increase the number of cases of severe disease by shifting the burden of infection toward older individuals.”
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652751/</p>
<p>MedXriv Study:</p>
<p>“Inferences on effects of NPIs are non-robust and highly sensitive to model specification. Claimed benefits of lockdown appear grossly exaggerated.” https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160341v3</p>
<p>British Medical Journal:
“Stronger interventions, however, are associated with suppression of the infection such that a second wave is observed once the interventions are lifted . . . However, this suppression then leads to a second wave with a higher peak demand for ICU beds than during the intervention period, and total numbers of deaths that exceed those of the same scenario without place closures.”</p>
<p>“We confirm that adding school and university closures to case isolation, household quarantine, and social distancing of over 70s would lead to more deaths compared with the equivalent scenario without the closures of schools and universities. Similarly, general social distancing was also projected to reduce the number of cases but increased the total number of deaths compared with social distancing of over 70s only. We note that in assessing the impact of school closures, UK policy advice has concentrated on reducing total number of cases and not the number of deaths.” https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3588</p>
<p>Biosecurity and Bioterrorism Journal:</p>
<p>“It is difficult to identify circumstances in the past half-century when large-scale quarantine has been effectively used in the control of any disease. The negative consequences of large-scale quarantine are so extreme (forced confinement of sick people with the well; complete restriction of movement of large populations; difficulty in getting critical supplies, medicines, and food to people inside the quarantine zone) that this mitigation measure should be eliminated from serious consideration.”</p>
<p>“Travel restrictions, such as closing airports and screening travellers at borders, have historically been ineffective.”</p>
<p>“It has been recommended that individuals maintain a distance of 3 feet or more during a pandemic so as to diminish the number of contacts with people who may be infected. The efficacy of this measure is unknown.”</p>
<p>page20image680768 page20image680960page20image681152
Page 20</p>
<p>“Cancelling or postponing large meetings would not be likely to have any significant effect on the development of the epidemic.”</p>
<p>“There are few data available to support the efficacy of N95 or surgical masks outside a healthcare setting.”
