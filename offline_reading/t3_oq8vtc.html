        <p>Im a physician.  I would vote for this guy.  But calling for balance these days is a call that just gets you shouted down by the branch Covidians who approach the vaccine with an almost religious logic.  I'm my state, 2 kids have died of Covid since the beginning.  2.  I'm not giving my kids the shot. Period.</p>

        <p>Honestly, most of my colleagues think I'm crazy for not getting the vax.  I'm actually very well known in my field (which is a very small and unknown branch of medicine) and when that topic comes up, I think they have lost a little respect for me.  Then I tell them why, and then it's a funny reaction because I make them afraid that they made the wrong choice.  At the end of the day most docs "trust the science".  But the reason I'm so well regarded in my field is because I don't "trust the science".  My career has been built on poking holes in the conventional way medicine is practiced.  I actually know how "the science" works psychologically and from a business and reputation standpoint.  And there are lots of problems that the public (and, frankly, most doctors) don't understand.  I readily admit that I could be wrong in my assessment of the situation but that 99.98% statistical survival in my case, just isn't a grave enough risk to put up against a panic-driven medical experiment.  It could be just fine, and it probably will be just fine for most people who take the vaxx.  But im OK with my 1:5000 chance of death while im waiting to find out.</p>
