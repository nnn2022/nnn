    <strong>Say no to VACCINE PASSPORTS</strong>
    <p><p>The mere mention of vaccination passports or papers 18 months ago to enter any sort of societal-based establishment was immediately dismissed by the public and elitist officials as nonsensical or down-right conspiracy theorem. This coherently begs the question, if these undemocratic, liberty-busting methods of "public safety" can be thrown across entire civilizations under the guise of fear and behavioral science, where do we draw the line? Once passports are normalized, could they morph into something more radical?</p>
<p>Stumble into the present, the same government and elitist officials label those against the use of vaccine papers as selfish conspiracy theorists pushing this narrative throughout the media arms which eventually filters down to the public. The public has now struck gold as the mental gymnastics Olympics often unwilling to venture outside their short-sighted view of reality and into the cuffs of the matrix.</p>
<p>I can understand the short-sightedness of the general public. (whilst extremely frustrating and puzzling for those that are able to sit on the cuffs of this reality)</p>
<p>Government behavioral science and the collusion of propaganda fuelled fear into everyday citizens pushing the narrative that the virus is a threat to civilization. After all, no fear, no compliance with lockdown restrictions and vaccination requests.</p>
<p>Now, I won't go into detail in regards to the use of psychology and behavioral science in order to manipulate the masses and whether it was ethical. But there is an article here on the methods witnessed throughout the last 18 months. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0884-z">Click</a>.</p>
<p>Now, there is a famous quotation. <strong>Never let a good crisis go to waste.</strong> The control of civilizations with fear under the illusion of safety becomes normalized. Policies the public would have revolutionized against 18 months prior are now accepted and supported and those with critiquing opinions are dismissed or silenced. Do we want to live in a society where potentially ground-breaking ideas are silenced? Some of the most incredible revolutions and changes came from those on the fringes of society with alternate opinions to the mainstream status quo.</p>
<p>Do you want to live in a society where the status quo completely eradicates liberty, the expression of alternate opinion, and the right to be able to decide what's in you and your family's best interest? You think tyranny can't function in the west. You've been conditioned to believe that these ideals are reserved for countries such as China. But it's happening and it's here under the guise of safety.</p>
<p>Vaccine passports as a condition for societal normalcy are the single biggest assault on individual liberty in western politics. This goes beyond left-right politics. This ventures beyond the vaccinated/unvaccinated denominator. All groups should be alarmed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The gravest concern here is the direction we're heading in as a society. Do we believe the vaccine passports are a temporary measure under the guise of eradicating a deadly virus or is this a blatant power grab with the intention to morph the passport into something far more radical? After all, a vaccine passport was considered radical only 18 months. Imagine the achievements in double-time. Restrictions of energy consumption via the use of carbon points or penalized for the types of groceries you buy in-store, ironically announced in the UK this week. A technocratic fascist delusion of China's present social credit system.</p>
<p>Passports are divisive and risk creating a two-tier society. The propaganda machine already pitches those who aren't vaccinated against those that are. Those that have been skeptical from the beginning have always noted that the government wouldn't physically force you to submit to inoculation but they will use all resources at their disposal (psychology and behavioral science) for compliance. Is this ethical? Will these techniques evolve further into radical changes to liberty?</p>
<p>They are a violation of informed consent. It's an unethical principle of coercion. There is a magnitude of factors as to why someone wouldn't want to innoculate. They can evaluate their own risk and read statistics. Concerns with the ethics and principles of the manufacturers. Religious grounds. Free will.</p>
<p>Are vaccine passports useful when the vaccines do not <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-sees-drop-pfizer-vaccine-protection-against-infections-still-strong-2021-07-05/">limit the spread entirely?</a> Vaccinated people can spread the disease. Do vaccines offer protection against the variant factory? Vaccinated people are more likely to transmit the virus as the vaccine prevents symptoms of the disease only. They are less likely to know they even have the virus without being tested for it.</p>
<h1>The cost of risking civil liberties far out-weigh the hypnotic illusion of safety.</h1></p>
