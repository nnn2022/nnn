    <strong>I've finally snapped. New Jerseys government has a vaccine festish forcing a anime con to cancel months ahead of schedule.</strong>
    <p><p>Almost every state government has a vaccine fetish from this covid19 panic and theyre not giving in until they get a vaccine even if the pandemic is over.</p>
<p>I've just found out that new jerseys vaccine fetish forced a anime con to cancel months early.</p>
<p>For fuck sake, I need ANYTHING to look forward to away from BLM/TRUMP/COVID/BIDEN bullshit that I've been constantly hearing!</p>
<p>Why am I not allowed to look forward to anything? Just because some failed governor fucked up their response to covid19 and wants a bailout/vaccine for it?</p>
<p>I've snapped at that damn twitter account and no one fucking replied. They know its horrible but they wont admit it.</p>
<p>They all know theres no vaccine coming until fall 2021. I'm fucking livid that every light at the end of the tunnel gets snuffed out because governors can't let go of their vaccine fetish because they too busy looking good on twitter or cnn.</p>
<p>I just wanted a goddamn summer. A fucking summer and failed governor's stole it away because politics.</p>
<p>What the fuck am I supposed to do for the next 12 months before a failed govenror wants to steal more of my life and future.</p>
<p>How good is living if i NOT ALLOWED TO LOOK FORWARD TO ANYTHING FOR THE NEXT 12-18 MONTHS!</p></p>

        <p>I completely get this. I have truly lost count of how many times I have cried because yet another event got canceled. There is zero to look forward to and sadly my favorite things to do are the things that seem like they will never exist again at times. It’s truly awful. At the start of 2020, I was struggling mentally so I bought a wall calendar and wrote in all the things I was excited about because I thought that would help. I ended up throwing it away in late April. I’m so sorry your con got canceled.</p>

<p>I actually bought a calender like you did, i didn't bother using it past march.</p>
<p>Every convention I wanted to go got canceled. A concert I wanted to go got canceled. I wanted to travel to get away before a demoxratic mayor in houston decided to play politics just to get rid of a gop convention by canceling every conventiom until 2021.</p>
<p>And democrats demand me to "fix" their shit by voting for a medically unfit candidate. Fuck no, im voting for Trump either.</p>
<p>I'm not bothering looking forward to 2021, they will still want their vaccine fix! I'm hoping that I'll be dead before then after election day.</p>

        <p>The whole situation is just awful and one of the hardest things about it for me personally is the consistent moving of the goal posts regarding when in the hell this thing can be considered handled. We went from flatten the curve so we don’t overwhelm hospitals to no one can do anything fun or meaningful (have to include that because non famous people can’t even really have funerals) until there’s a vaccine to the bullshit now that the vaccine may not eliminate the need for social distancing. To be honest, I could see myself being worried for the rest of my life (and I’m only 37) that things can be taken away completely on a whim. I hope that’s not what happens but I have an anxiety disorder and am prone to catastrophic thinking. However, even with that piece of my mental health, I have never been scared of actually catching this thing. I have been way more scared of my life continuing to suck because of the response to this than I ever have been of contracting it. I worked really hard to be able to do the things I once did and not being able to do them anymore has definitely put me in the worst mental health state than I have been in in years.</p>

        <p>It's a shame they're blind to who they themselves really are. You know what? I am selfish, I am a coward, I really don't care about 99.9% of my fellow humans, I myself am a "doomer" when it comes to the sociopolitical fallout of this pandemic scare. I can also be pretty stupid too, especially when it comes to giving people benefit of the doubt, when it comes to arguing with stupid people and allowing them to bring me down to their level. Hell, I'm even a hypocrite!</p>
<p>But at least I admit it. At least I know what I am. Yeah, I might feel bad for the families torn apart by poverty and suicide, the families who really did lose people to the virus, the babies with COVID toes or who's parents won't let them see grandma without a mask, but do you know why I'm really against the New Normal? Me. My husband. My immediate friends and family. Those loved ones who very well might die from the rona, but are much more likely to wither away from mental illness because both work and play are unbearably restricted or simply shut down.</p>
<p>It goes against the hard-wiring of our mammal brains to genuinely care about millions of strangers without that "care" being hollow and shallow as fuck. I can't truly care about your grandma, not nearly as much as I care about my own. And my grandma is already dead. Because elderly people are at higher risk for most respiratory infections, be it COVID, influenza, or bacterial pneumonia. The two greatest flaws of our modern society? Valuing years lived over quality of life, and this concept of a "global village" where everyone loves each other like family.</p>

        <p>That’s fair. You don’t know me. Almost all of societal progress has actually been produced by enlightened self-interest, not the government gun forcing you to care about millions of people you don’t know in a particular way.</p>

        <p>I’m a libertarian who’s been coming farther and farther out of the closet because all of my friends voted Murphy for legal weed, and now we’re being scolded like toddlers by a power-hungry man child. I’m just relieved to know that if I’m in the minority it’s not such a small one.</p>

        <p>They've been dangling that "legal weed" carrot for like 2 election cycles now. Jersey is a mob state. I met Murphy prior to his election. He has the same fake, possibly cocaine-induced smile as every other politician. Don't get me started on Steve Fulop in Jersey City.</p>

        <p>No politician pays lip service to legal weed for any reason other than to bring a single-issue voting block out. They don’t have to do anything, and then they can blame it on their partisan adversaries.</p>

        <p>I'm an artist and I had 21 conventions cancel on me.  I'm out 30k plus in income from those shows. Yeah, sdcc went virtual and it was a failure. I would've made at least 6 grand there.  But I've had conventions cancel that weren't even scheduled until December already cancel.  Hell, there's already talk of sdcc canceling next year already.  It's a joke. And I find myself spiralling more into depression every day. There's seemingly no end to this</p>

        <p>Exactly.  Artist alley is a visual experience.  Without people walking by your table and seeing something they like,  it's all pointless.  Besides the actual selling of art and doing on the spot commissions,  even the whole experience of meeting new people and the community of socializing is gone.  That is also a blow to my mental health.  Virtual cons are a joke. And as you said,  the booth fees were just rolled over to next year's dates.  Awesome.  So when those get canceled too, we're just never getting that money back.  Fucking ridiculous</p>

<p>With the major exception of Otakon Online and various anime conventions.</p>
<p>Which ironcally for a anime convention (im talking about otakon here), theyre doing a good job in at least having a con with live TV channels instead of dumping zoom conference calls on YouTube (see ya boi zack's channel about it)</p>
<p>I hate the virtrual convention experince because its alienating to me and having a text box is not the same as a human atmosphere with cosplayers and attendees. If people enjoy virtural cons and plenty of them do (the good ones) that's great, but i hate it.</p>
<p>&rt;Of all the virtual cons I’ve gotten around 2-5% of my usual income from a con. Seriously. Indie arts and entertainment will take years to recover while the masses continue to gorge on marvel capeshit. Yes I’m bitter.</p>
<p>If it makes you feel better, disney economically is going to shit. At the same time marvel comics might go out of business. At the same time marvel studios will be still churning out capeshit.</p>

        <p>My favorite (and by favorite, I mean, I think it's stupid as hell) has been all of the big name music festivals like Lollapalooza and Tomorrowland putting on "virtual" music festivals and acting like it's a perfectly okay substitute. Half the time, it's old footage from previous festivals or pre-recorded footage. If I wanted to watch old videos of Lollapalooza sets, I would fucking watch one of the thousands of videos uploaded by someone who actually went. Don't call it a "virtual music festival". It's not a fucking music festival. It's a VIDEO. </p>
<p>And the ones who are actually charging people money to watch these jokes are greedy fucks.</p>

        <p>Dragoncon cancelled. That would have been $7500 for me if it went as well as last year. I typically average $4500 a show and had had my entire year wiped out. All of my outdoor events cancelled even though they’re fucking outside! Months of protesting shoulder to shoulder didn’t increase the spread of the virus, but allowing working class artists and food truck vendors to make a living is literally killing grandma. I’ve spent the last 15 years building my business to have it all ripped away from me in less than a year. I can’t afford to pay last years taxes. I have no idea if any of these shows are going to go bankrupt and keep my booth fees. I don’t even know if there will be any money left for us even IF we’re allowed to have shows again. I know we’re the definition of “nonessential” but art and entertainment make life worth living for a lot of people. They’re a byproduct of a healthy society and economy. </p>
<p>Gig workers in my state got no unemployment. That $2400 stimulus has long been gone. Fuck. At this point if i got covid and died at least the value of my work would skyrocket... if they didn’t blame me for catching it in the first place. I’m sorry fellow artist bro.</p>

        <p>&rt; Why am I not allowed to look forward to anything? </p>
<p>that is the whole idea. the whole idea is to make living impossible and ever harder and take everything away, so that when they will finally bring out the vaccine, people will beg for it, as it will be sold as a "way back to normal", although if it goes by the criminal politicians and monsters like bill gates, the tracking and forced vaccines will continue forever.</p>
<p>i mean i hate to be the bringer of bad news, but that is the plan, forced vaccines, regardless of how many suffer or die and regardless,  that no one EVER asked for one, forced slave masks, forced tracking apps, or straight up tracking implant.</p>
<p>and in regards to get some happiness, maybe try to find things, that the criminal government can't really interfere with, despite them trying.</p>
<p>going into nature, go swimming at an open lake somewhere. go camping,  idk, but that might help in a world, where the criminal government is trying to remove all happiness from u and sell u poison.</p>

<p>have u tried sharing peer reviewed research with them, it certainly can't hurt, if u still try to get them  to get back to common sense?</p>
<p>in regards to mandatory masks, u can share this study with them, showing, that masks have 0 effect on virus based infection spread:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic</a> </p>
<p>and in regards to lockdown u can share this article, that references and links to several studies going over deaths of despair, which are caused by an economy destroying lockdown of course:</p>
<p><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/will-deaths-of-despair-outpace-deaths-from-coronavirus/">https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/will-deaths-of-despair-outpace-deaths-from-coronavirus/</a> </p>
<p>maybe u can reach some sanity, when u show them, that deaths of despair FAR FAR FAR outrun even the fake and made up death numbers by the government.</p>
<p>pointing this part out in particular to them:</p>
<p>&rt; …a 1% increase in the unemployment rate sustained over a period of six years has been associated (during the past three decades) with increases of 36,887 total deaths, including 20,240 cardiovascular deaths, 920 suicides, 648 homicides, 495 deaths from cirrhosis of the liver, 4,227 state mental hospital admissions, and 3,340 state prison admission. </p>
<p>number adjusted for the population growth since that research results in 58834 deaths  these days per 1% unemployment in the usa, all in the article.</p>
<p>maybe u can reach a few of those, or at least u can throw the research at them and call them idiots, if that helps ;)</p>
<p>&rt; All of them are pro lockdown. I have not heard one politician in the US speaking out against the prolonged lockdowns! </p>
<p>i think there are very very few, that aren't and aren't bought up criminal actors trying to destroy and enslave a country, but yeah.</p>
<p>definitely don't look to the political system for saviors :D</p>
<p>&rt; Problem is I am alone. I dont have people who contact me to check if im OK. </p>
<p>well same here, screw this world and the monsters and people in it :/</p>

        <p>We should start an online campaign for “vote of no confidence”. Neither schlub running is good for us. I’m tired of voting lesser of 2 evils. Plandemic happens when we continue to vote lesser of 2 evils.</p>

        <p>I'm from New Jersey. Most of my family is still there. I swear there is a collective amnesia regarding the timeline and why of the lockdown.  A few of them said it was always about stopping the virus and Murphy is protecting the state from disaster. They don't even remember what flatten the curve meant and are brainwashed to wait until a vaccine. The goal now is to eliminate the virus at whatever cost. I thought about moving down the shore next year to be closer to family but hell no now. PA isn't much better with Wolf but I'd rather deal with him. At least more of PA has a spine then NJ.</p>

        <p>Pretty much. Most of them are still working - mostly from home. The lockdown has def had a negative effect on their work but it hasn't really taken anything from them that'd made them snap. Though a few of them did leave NYC and Jersey City/Hoboken and moved back to the suburbs and shore. Its wild. I heard - "Well Murphy's keeping us from turning into Florida" covid deaths by state per capitia - NJ #1  Flordia #20. Also two weeks ago Murphy forced bill through that plunged New Jersey further $10 billion in debt all because of damage from "pandemic". New Jersey is done for. What a fucking mess.</p>

        <p>Because it is a common misconception. </p>
<p>Every Facebook or Twitter post announcing a cancelation have people saying "thank you for a difficult decision" or "im sad but glad: type of post.</p>
<p>No legitimate anger, no legitimate concern from other people that they unable to look forward to anything as an escape. And if you have the balls to express legitimate sorrow or anything not positive, they will attack you.</p>
<p>I dont know where are anime fans that are concerned or express their anger or upset that they have to endure a year while putting up with the collaspe of a country. There are many but they dont speak up or I do not see them.</p>

<p>But noo<em>OOOOOOOoooooooooo</em>. You fuckers had to fly into a rage and throw a fucking tantrum because "BUT I WANT TO DO THING!!!! <strong><em>I WANT DO THING NOOWW!!!</em></strong> GUBMINT CANT SAY I CANT DO THING!!!!!"</p>
<p>So you got your fucking wish. You screeched and cried and squealed and thrashed and kicked and bit and spat and whined until finally you got your wish and got everything opened up early because <em>fuck</em> public health. I need to get a fucking haircut and buy some goddamn seeds. </p>
<p>And now, while other countries that actually handled this virus and got it under control are re-opening, going back to work, going back out, enjoying the rest of the summer <a href="https://i.redd.it/xby3c7vie9b51.jpg">we're sitting here like a bunch of grounded kids watching our friends have fun from our bedroom window.</a></p>
<p>You have literally nobody to blame for your situation but you. You, and people like you, who were unable to put up with even the most minor of inconveniences for the greater good without flying into a thermonuclear autistic rage, are the reason we're in this living fucking hell right now.</p>
<p>So quit your whining and suck it the fuck up.</p>

<p><em>-the dipshit says, until it’s him or someone he loves on a ventilator</em> </p>
<p>I lost my (low six figures) job and subsequently got a better job due to COVID. Life happens.  I’m just going to extrapolate that you’re a trump guy based on the fact you’re stupid enough to post here unironically - look at any other wealthy nation in the world and see how much better off we’d be with competent leadership and a population who cares about their neighbors. I probably wouldn’t have lost my job if our curve had mirrored those in Europe or any other country with a fucking plan. </p>
<p>Saving lives and saving our economy are only mutually exclusive because of dumbasses like you. </p>
<p>You can reply here, you are definitely the kind of simpleminded goof who needs to ‘win’ internet arguments. I’ll return to my life being a normal grownup.</p>

        <p>Oh, you're upper middle class. That explains a lot. Sorry, I'm not a "he" like you seem to assume, nor am I a Trump supporter. Almost all government/corporate executives are trash. Of course you assume I'm a Trump guy though, because no one else would rather risk a novel cold than live in the globalized collectivist dystopia you seem to desire. The lives we're "saving" are lives nearing the end anyway, mostly all elderly, obese, or otherwise unhealthy. I would fully expect to see those people on a ventilator within 5 years with or without COVID. Yes, life happens, and people die. One of the greatest flaws in our society is the focus on saving lives rather than making life worth living.</p>
<p>I'm done with you though, I have no desire to speak with rich bastards who unabashedly admit to benefitting from the current situation while people are starving to death and comitting suicide in droves. Don't pretend to care about saving lives when you make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year playing a rigged system. In case you weren't aware, most "normal grownups" don't have six-figure salaries. Unless you're the kind of classist garbage who thinks poor folks don't count because they're uneducated peasants. Yes I'm selfish as fuck, but at least I know what I am.</p>
<p>Fuck off with your greed and hypocrisy. kthnxbai</p>
