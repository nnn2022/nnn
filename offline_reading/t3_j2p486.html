        <p>I do find it weird that this has been messaged as a “war” (Americans do love fighting their wars) with proclaiming everyone “heroes” and bullshit, and as much as Americans love fighting their wars they hate losing them even more (war on drugs, Afghanistan, etc etc).</p>

        <p>Difference is this false war effects everybody and not just the people going overseas to fight. That's why the doomers stack of cards are failing, they've brought everybody into the ring and people have been forced to participate that never goes well and never works in history. Like forcibly drafting your entire population. It makes one issue everybodies issue.</p>

        <p>Agreed but other countries are using similarly emotive wording to position the population as being in a "fight against Covid".  This time we are not the only ones, although as you say we are probably the most adamant about the whole "war on whatever" mentality.</p>

        <p>Americans do not "love fighting their wars." My grandfather, my father and myself all saw friends go off to die for some greedy politicians that we believe should be tried as war criminals. We are taken extreme advantage of in the name of Freedom and then sold a bunch of bullshit about heroes and patriotism. Illegal "wars" are not heroic and not all of us support them.</p>

        <p>Similar to how Donald Trump measures success by the amount of COVID tests being done? Or how he said we would be in good shape if we can contain the virus before it reaches 200,000 deaths? What now? Everyone stop wearing masks and social distancing and the US reaches 10,000,000 deaths?</p>

        <p>Expect for the fact that measuring the amount of COVID cases is the only way of measuring the success of eradicating the virus. There are other factors that affect the death rate such as the average age of infected people, and current medical advancements. There are many practices now that are being used that are helping reduce the number of deaths that were unknown to the healthcare system back in March. </p>
<p>When there is a global health pandemic, the only way to measure progress is by using statistics that outline the health of the population. Were not going to start counting the number of construction pylons on the road to see how successful we are at eliminating a virus.</p>

        <p>And this is why we never reach a consensus. This belief that we can somehow eradicate the virus. It's not going away. We are so far past containment that's it's baffling to me that we are still talking about it like this.</p>

        <p>There are a handful of countries that are so far past containment because of people's beliefs like yours (and America being one of those countries). There are a lot of countries that have in fact contained and few that have eradicated the virus by taking the precautionary measures seriously. The objective should be to contain the virus as much as physically possible until a vaccine is readily available. By not wearing a mask, or respecting COVID prevention measures, you are increasing the number of COVID related illnesses, as well as COVID related deaths.</p>

        <p>We've been in the mitigation phase since March. WHO and China blew containment by allowing international travel full well knowing what they were sending to the rest of the world. </p>
<p>From ABC,</p>
<p>According to travel data previously obtained by ABC News, those flights translated to more than 761,000 Chinese nationals entering the U.S. and Americans returning home from the People’s Republic of China during that critical four-month period.</p>

<p>I can't believe there's people that still think we're in containment phase when this virus is literally everywhere around the globe. Just because it's novel doesn't mean it acts wildly different from any other pandemic/virus with a high R0.</p>

<p>Sure I can concede that, but the whole "virus eradication" train left the station many months ago. So why chase such an impossible ideal? </p>
<p>&rt;Were not going to start counting the number of construction pylons</p>
<p>No, but we know that the majority of people need little to no treatment from a corona infection, so why should they be of any concern to public health? Especially now that we, like you mentioned, have found effective treatments for people that already have been infected.</p>

        <p>&rt;So why chase such an impossible ideal?</p>
<p>Because it's not necessarily an impossible ideal. It's only impossible when states lift restrictions to resume to normal life, or when masses of people do not think that precautionary measures will help. Don't get me wrong, it would be extremely difficult for America to reduce it's cases enough to a level where it could be considered contained, but there's no point in giving up on reducing the number of infected people and deaths.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;so why should they be of any concern to public health? </p>
<p>Because it is extremely new information and treatments that are being used which may not be effective on all people. Why not take every precaution necessary to reduce the number of deaths?</p>

<p>I don't complety disagree, but this brings me back to the point about the severity of most infections, this might seem circular but it is what it is. If we know that the virus really isn't that big of a deal to most people why should it be used as a measure? The "second" wave we're seeing in Europe right now has us at record levels of cases but deaths are way down.</p>
<p>&rt;Why not take every precaution necessary to reduce the number of deaths?</p>
<p>At some point we're going to reach a point of diminishing returns, and as has been covered countless times over on the main skeptic sub, all these precautions aren't without downsides.</p>
