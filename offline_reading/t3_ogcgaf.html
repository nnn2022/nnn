    <strong>I've come to terms that this is my last summer</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all, I'm a long-time lurker here so I have decided to make a completely new profile to comment here (Not using the one for my arts/doodles). </p>
<p>I'm from Slovenia, where our PV (who was in jail but somehow got free and let a free pass to join the Government) is one, if not the most horrible politician at the moment. He corrupted all important aspects in our country: Courts, police, other politicians, country's health institute, medical staffs, doctors, you name the position, I'm pretty sure army as well. Opposition is acting like they are against him, but we all know they are the same behind the camera. Yesterday the new "law" passed, I have no idea how to call it as it's not really the law (yet, will definitely be since courts are bribed), that they can legally boss us when to go to quarantine, for how long, we can be sent to those concentration camps by force (in our country there are 3 for now I believe), all because of you not wanting to take the devil experimental liquor. If you do not agree with him and them (his corrupted team), this most likely will happen to majority of us. This means that the corrupted politicians will be in charge of our health without the so-called medical/scientist's experts (the same ones who are bribed to work for his sake anyway, the real ones are censored, banned, deleted or ignored). Double standards between politicians and citizens is on such an absurd level.</p>
<p>What really bothers me is the fact, that people think all of this won't happen. We also don't have aggression in us, to take our country back. People are only noisy on facebook and preaching about karma. So fighting in our country is not possible as people expect others to take care of this problem for them.</p>
<p>So knowing this is the only safe place where I can vent my frustrations, I've come to terms, that this is my last summer and I plan on jumping off a building in my City, with goodbye letter being posted on my social medias, so I won't need to contact every single person individually, and then I'll let my phone home, so no one is going to be able to reach out. It actually feels way better now that I accepted this. The Rock and his kids pebbles have fallen off of my shoulders and it feels easier now to breathe. I'm tired of fighting about stressing for the near future, alarming people and my friends, I'm tired of always seeing or hearing about this <a href="https://cov.id">cov.id</a> bs. At this point, i'm mentally too tired, yet I've been through my whole life of being bullied, picked on, having to build my own confidence and self esteem, learning how to take rejections, enjoy time alone, taking chances alone without waiting for someone to join me etc etc. But this? This is just too much. I'm ready to die in an instant way, not by some horrible side effects of this liquid, bit by bit. </p>
<p>I've been nothing but a good person to every single soul on this Planet. Minded my own business all the time and always been kind, Offered support and help to whoever needed, even if it was my last thing I had. Never done anything wrong to go to jail or court or never have I been warned by the police. And in return, I get this shiez? </p>
<p>I'm sorry if I do not believe in God or "karma". I am not religious, but I respect every single religion, different belief, lifestyle, race, color of the skin, disagreement and everything that fits the criteria of a human being.<br>
My best and last two student years incoming, turned into, worst years of my life and making me go off the edge. Never ever before in my life was I suicidal. I do not need a therapist, the only thing I need is my old life back and to leave me the heck alone, but we all know this won't happen.</p>
<p>I'm a person of words, proven by the same exact actions, always. But I want to simply close my eyes forever. Hopefully you guys will have the strength to win this battle. But seeing how easy humans can be controlled and deceived, while technology gets more and more advanced every day, I can only hope for people to win this one. </p>
<p>From September onward, I'll be eating pizzas on big chubby clouds. Until now, I'm slowly relaxing my soul. I apologizes for my English and any mistake, it's not my mother language and I'm typing a bit quickly.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post, I hope it's okay. If it's not allowed, I apologies for it and I hope it gets removed. Sorry if the formatting is messed up, I do not use much Reddit.  </p>
<p>All the power to you </p>
