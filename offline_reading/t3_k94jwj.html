        <p>Wow, what a creepy statement - "We will shut you down", "illegally operating".  What country is this?  Can you please recall this bastard?  No way is this guy getting reelected.  He'll be shopping at Dollar Tree just like the former governor of PA Tom Corbett (spotted him coming out of one a few years ago and a former state senator shopping yesterday).</p>

        <p>I'm in PA and Wolf actually has been showing a tiny bit of sense.  A few weeks ago he said he realizes the economy of the state is fragile.  Then just yesterday he held a doomer news conference but did not issue a (now illegal) shutdown order, only saying that they would be looking at options in the next few days.  That likely won't stop our Allegheny County "executive" and his "health minister" from shutting things down.  The health minister said a few weeks ago "I'm done asking; I'm telling you" as if she were talking to some kids.</p>

        <p>My concern with Wolf is that he is just waiting a couple of days to strike again.  Numbers were down a bit over the last couple days due to the weekend so I could see him delaying until tomorrow as Thursday tends to have the highest numbers so he can try to justify with historically high case numbers.</p>

        <p>I have a few movies I want to go to, so I'm trying to get out soon because these bastards will likely shut down theaters again even though nobody is in them and no cases have been tied to them.  These businesses can't take anymore punishment.</p>

        <p>We have one theater left near us that is still open.  All others are closed temporarily (who knows maybe permanently).</p>
<p>On 24 screens they have 32 scheduled showings all day today.  Not sure how much longer before they call it quits for now as well</p>

        <p>I have a bunch open in Pittsburgh, and a couple have been open since June or July.  One even had a notice on its website a month or so ago that they closed temporarily because of no big movies, but I checked yesterday and they're back open.  I think the full theater rentals where a family or whatever can pay $100+ to rent an auditorium have been keeping these theaters afloat.  They have <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> coming up and they have to be open for that even though fucking WB has turned its back on theaters and is putting the damn movie on the internet on the same day.</p>
<p>Even though I don't mind empty or lower capacity theaters, at this time it's sort of depressing.  I've been 17 times since they reopened and would have gone twice that had I the time.  They're showing a lot of older movies which is great.  I went to <em>Flash Gordon</em> a few weeks ago when the doom message was renewed. Even though about five others were in the theater, when I came out, no employees were around.  It was a ghost town.</p>

        <p>This makes me sick.  At his press conference yesterday, every reporter asked him if he was going to "shut things down" like other governors are doing.  He probably thinks he has to keep pace as a "democrat" governor.  So thousands of businesses are destroyed because of his vanity.  We need the courts to enforce the injunction or whatever it was preventing him from doing this.  On the news you find these business owners absolutely fearful of what is going to happen to them.  This isn't America.  And it won't do a goddamn thing.</p>

        <p>Yep, he doesn’t give a shit about the businesses.  Any business connected to the “right” people will be allowed to continue to operate so no issues for the politically connected.</p>
<p>Besides, he will give his usual smirk (which will somehow still be visible thru the mask) and tell us that he is not the one making the rules, it is the virus so don’t get mad at him.</p>

<p>If that is the case I actually like that the rumor made it as far as a news report this time.  The doomers had themselves a little circlejerk going on about more restrictions FINALLY being announced only to have the rug pulled out from under them if it is not true.</p>

        <p>Except in Pittsburgh our "county executive" was blabbering about Wolf shutting stuff down.  At least that's what I caught.  If Wolf doesn't, likely he will in Allegheny, though.  Apparently hellhole Philadelphia is shut down.</p>

        <p>Philly is “shutdown” (I live in the suburbs) but a lot of people are ignoring it.  From talking to coworkers that live there the roads are just as crowded if not more so as more people head to the suburbs where the businesses are not as restricted.</p>
<p>That being said, if we do get new restrictions this week my bet is it will be on Thursday as thursdays are usually the highest case count day of the week to try and drive some fear acceptance of the restrictions</p>

        <p>In my area (upstate NY) movie theaters never came back at all. Haven’t seen a movie outside my home since 2019.</p>
<p>ADD: They created these ‘pop-up’ drive-ins with blow-up screens showing old movies, charging money for something they did last year for FREE in a local park. Incredible.</p>

        <p>That's what's annoying. And these areas just get more and more blue the more they move in. They say "I don't vote for that" but it doesn't match up with the reality. That's why you have to move to a place where transplants won't think to move. That's my next goal. Think two or three steps ahead of everyone else.</p>

        <p>Goldman Sachs shill. NJ politicians began promising cushy pension handouts to state employees for votes years ago. Very little voter turnout except state employees.</p>
<p>Each election, the new pols promise more and more, and the financial results have left NJ in huge trouble and borrowing money from Sachs. Coincidentally, two of the last three governor are former Sachs execs. Hmm. </p>
<p>Sadly this bucktooth doofus will probably win reelection, people here bought into Corona nonsense hard, all the while not actually following it and blaming imaginary anti-maskers.</p>
