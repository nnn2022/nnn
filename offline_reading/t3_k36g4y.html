    <strong>I used to like Reason as a think tank, now they’re full of crap</strong>
    <p><p>https://reason.com/2020/11/25/masks-have-helped-to-blunt-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-kansas/</p>
<p>Let’s ignore the fact that there are obviously way too many variables to conclusively say masks have helped, or that a danish study basically refuted masks being effective, or that countries and states with mask mandates are exploding in cases even more than the ones that aren’t, or that you as a libertarian think tank are supposed to be fighting AGAINST the New Normal, not supporting it.</p>
<p>To hell with you, Reason.  Anybody else got some refutations of this bogus article?</p></p>

        <p>Idk. Seems like they're reporting the facts as-is. I didn't see any suggestion that they support mask mandates. I'd be more concerned with a media outlet that attempts to bias facts to support their own narrative.</p>
