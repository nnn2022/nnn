        <p>The sources in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>No, Conspiracy website with an extreme right bias. <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-site-news/">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/life-site-news/</a></li>
<li>Undercurrents is just someone's ramblings. No actual factual sources. More conspiracy.</li>
<li>
<p>Like #2 is someones blog. Links conspiracy and pseudoscience sites trying to pass as legit. So full of misinformation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the NY Post is right leaning. It fails fact checks frequently and uses a lot of sensationalism.  Overall the NYP is the best of this lot so far but you have to take what it publishes with a lot of caution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Korea source could be factual. But the cases they are talking about is outliers. Remember when people try to convince you that vaccines kill people that their have been about 4.5 BILLION doses given. Conspiracy theorists, are posting outliers that are a few here and there many of which seem to have an allergic reaction to the shot. In the US you are monitored for 10-20 minutes after getting the shot to make sure you aren't having any allergic reactions as  they tend to happen right away. But  if you feel like you are having a bad reaction to a vaccine or anything else, you should consult a medical professional. The amount of people who are allergic is very low and they tend to be allergic to other vaccines as well.  Vaccines are safer than over the counter pain killers and you are multiples more likely to die on your way to get a vaccine than from the vaccine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the first red flag is the name of the site.  It links trusted sites in order to make itself seem legit. But it is greatly misinterpreting the data and/or sensationalizing and/or just making stuff up. For example there are adverse events with the vaccines. The CDC ( <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html</a>) will even tell you this. However, every drug and vaccine has adverse events. This is nothing new.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What is really misleading is that adverse events are just unintended reactions. You know these commonly as "side effects" . The words are interchangeable but adverse isn't as well known and sounds more seriously than side effects doesn't it? Adverse is used in more in medical circles and side effects more with the general public. The flu vaccine and even tylenol have side effects and both of those can have severe side effects. In fact you will be hard pressed to find any drug on the market that doesn't have severe side effects in a small percentage of patients. The covid vaccines are no different.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The most factual of these sources is going to be the NY Post even though some of them link to factual sources. The Korean  source might be factual as well but that would require a lot more research i am not up for doing.  In any case i would take anything said in these sources with a grain of salt...if you value your life and the lives of people you care about.</p>
