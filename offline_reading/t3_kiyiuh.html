<title>So where are we on the spectrum of complete liberty no matter how many people die or get sick vs the entire world must stop if so much as one person gets sick or dies? Have any of the politician given any type of intelligible message on this?</title>

        <p>I haven’t heard one politician in the US talk about what mortality rate might be acceptable. It’s completely arbitrary as it stands, seems to be “anything worse than typical seasonal flu”, as it stands. Which is an insanely low bar to set and will guarantee many more lockdowns to come.</p>
<p>We need to demand politicians take a stance on this. They can’t be allowed to avoid this issue any longer.</p>

        <p>This is a discussion deliberately omitted by the governments,  and deliberately avoided by the MSM. Prior to 2020 we all lived in a world where it was accepted that people got sick and died,  and that there was a realistic value to attempting to save every life. </p>
<p>Say that now and idiots will call you a monster,  despite it being obvious and true. We could have ruined economies and our way of life any times over to treat diseases,  but did it within reason. We could have banned smoking,  poor diets,  mandated exercise,  mandated healthy food. We could have restricted speed limits to 10mph to ensure no deaths. We could have poured billions into solving everything.   Etc etc. But we didn't,  because there is a cost benefit analysis to be done which should take in to account the negatives, and also because we used to accept the concept we were born free and entitled to live our own lives. </p>
<p>The media have whipped up people's fear so all they care about are covid "cases" and deaths. They literally will become angry with you when you want to discuss the deaths or mental heath issues caused by lockdowns. Madness.</p>
<p>Anyway,  it's such an obvious concept OP that I'm afraid the answer must be that it's a deliberate act for them not to have had this discussion with us.</p>

        <p>No one could die and they would say "Well if we stopped wearing masks and social distancing someone COULD die. So we have to keep these policies in place as well as rolling lockdowns until Satan sends us his son."</p>

        <p>It's also hard when the cases are false and the deaths are just recategorized deaths. Literally no one could be sick or die, and they will find a way to make "cases"</p>
