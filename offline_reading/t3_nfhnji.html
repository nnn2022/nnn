    <strong>FDA Banning NAC Supplements (After They're Shown to HELP Covid)</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.marconews.com/story/life/2021/05/17/ask-pharmacist-nac-supplements-going-away-soon/5082002001/">Ask the Pharmacist: NAC supplements going away soon (marconews.com)</a></p>
<p>&rt;<em>"Cysteine is a natural compound and N acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a dietary supplement. That’s how you can find it in health food stores, as “NAC.” But you won’t find it for long, so if you want NAC, you should buy it now. It’s already virtually gone from Amazon!</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>There’s a disagreement between the Food and Drug Administration and the dietary supplement industry over how legal it is for dietary supplements to put this</em> <strong><em>amino acid</em></strong> <em>into their supplements. The NAC is also available by prescription. It is forcing Amazon and other selling platforms to take sides on the issue."</em></p>
<p>Oh no! Not an amino acid! (hard eyeroll)</p>
<p>I take NAC to help with one of my chronic conditions. It's amazing stuff! It has helped me reverse one condition completely and reduce the severity of another. No side effects.</p>
<p>NAC has been extensively studied for a wide variety of other conditions too. It's been sold as a supplement without any problems for decades. <strong>Now, all the sudden, since the pandemic, they've been working to make it prescription only.</strong> Why would they do that? Hmm, I don't know...</p>
<p>Here is the research on NAC and covid so far:  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649937/">N-Acetylcysteine to Combat COVID-19: An Evidence Review (nih.gov)</a></p>
<p>&rt;<em>"N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is inexpensive, has very low toxicity, has been FDA approved for many years, and has the potential to improve therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. NAC administered intravenously, orally, or inhaled, may suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication and may improve outcomes if used timely."</em></p>
<p><strong>So there's a cheap, safe, detoxifying supplement that could help people SURVIVE COVID, and they're working hard to make sure people can't access it.</strong></p>
<p>Please doomers, do tell me more about how the government cares about us and wants to keep us safe and healthy. /s</p>
<p>If any of you guys take NAC for a chronic condition like me, this is your warning. Most places are sold out already. Get what you can now. I was lucky enough to find 10 bottles available and stock up. I believe some of the bulk supplement sites are still selling it by the pound, also.</p></p>

        <p>I know. It really makes you wonder WTF the end goal is here. It's clearly not health or they'd be pushing stuff like NAC, vitamin D3, zinc, etc ALONG with the vaccines. It's  not like these things would counter each other in some way.</p>
<p>It's one of a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A big compliance test, and once it's completed, the data will be used to create a much scarier plan in the future. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something evil, like the whole depopulation or forcing infertility theories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something even crazier, like a microchip or whatever. I don't really think this, but the insistence on everyone being vaccinated and the IGNORING of anything else that might help does make me wonder. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They're just completely incompetent and have no idea what they're doing at all, and therefore shouldn't be giving anyone medical advice. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All possibilities are pretty terrifying.</p>

        <p>Are they going to ban food containing cysteine next?  I'm half surprised they haven't banned any food containing vitamins so they could sell us them back to prevent pellagra and scurvy...</p>
