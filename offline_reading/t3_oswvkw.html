    <strong>Not sure how it is in your state/country, but Florida is paradise rn.</strong>
    <p><p>Floridian, born and raised. Have lived out of state on and off since the start of the pandemic. I can spend too much time on here some time, so obviously I see a lot of COVID related info on a daily basis. The thing is, Florida isn‚Äôt just semi-normal, its really, truly normal. Have yet to find a place which requires a mask, barely any even show a reccomendation on the door. There have been tomes that people told me ‚Äútake off the mask, we don‚Äôt do that around here‚Äù which I know wouldnt sit right with some people. Another place‚Äôs door said ‚Äúmask required‚Äù, but when I asked they replied ‚Äúdo you have shoes on? You do? Ok, you‚Äôre good to come in.‚Äù That‚Äôs not to say that people won‚Äôt ask you‚Äôre vaccine status, if you have vaxxer friends they might, but not anywhere in public. Since the news seems to skew everything, how is it really in the other states/abroad?</p></p>

        <p>I worked with a guy who had vacation built up over a decade, and he would take a cruise all the damn time. He is the only person I‚Äôve met in Florida that has actually been on one.</p>

        <p>And yet, DeSantis still won't stop pimping out the jab. But to be fair, every single governor is too scared to push back against that. Even Trump.</p>

        <p>That is the sad thing. Although our state is very vocal against any forms of passports or mandates, he still has to essentially ‚Äúroll-over‚Äù for the vaccine. It isn‚Äôt surprising though, for 2 reasons: he wants to run for president, and he is a governor. As much as we wish the governors would stand up against it, realistically, it would cause absolute madness.</p>

        <p>Hahaha I am in Cali and yesterday my local news, I think it was KSBW, put out a story (and of course it involves a dr sounding the alarm!!) about the Orlando area being ravaged by covid!! The story is talking about Orange County FL but not once did they mention that, they called it ‚Äúthe Orlando area where universal studies and Disney are located‚Äù.</p>

        <p>I'm in Berkeley, was actually born and raised in FLA though. Anyway masks are pretty common here, however in places where it's optional inside, I'd say about 1/3 of people don't wear them, including employees. Compare that to full 100% compliance six months ago.</p>

        <p>I concur. Florida is open and all the businesses in this VERY RED county will NEVER close down again and we, the customers, won't let them!! We will support them.</p>
<p>Florida is proof positive that Covid ain't real because the old people would be stacking up like cord wood if it were. If you have never been to Florida you seriously can not even imagine how many old people are here, from one end to the other. It's God's Waiting Room, no joke.</p>
<p>Sadly, mass death is what will happen to them this winter because so many of them ran down to the vax station and took Satan's piss. Florida is going to be a gold mine of estate sales, used vehicles, RVs and boats and nice homes that nobody wants over the next couple years as these old Boomers bite the dust. They're all so stupid, worship their TVs all day long. I have so many of them as customers. Their version of retirement couldn't be more empty. Never thinking about volunteering, especially to the youth. Retired boomers are the most vacuous and now, doomed, people in America.</p>
<p>Btw, they are starting to drop like flies all around me from this vax. I know, it's just "anecdotal" but I didn't lose a single customer last year and already 5 dead this year with many more on Death Watch. I tried to warn them, I really did, but you know how that goes.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you believe in freedom and want to live in paradise come to Florida. If you have Kool Aid hair and believe in social justice movements please move to Georgia, lol. (Got to get a dig on the leg humpers!)</p>

        <p>Rural part of Texas. When I stick to our wee town you rarely see muzzles and there are no signs up. If I was unplugged from all news and social media it would feel like 2019.
My kids are doing sports stuff at the school and no muzzles at all. 
The only time I‚Äôm remind of all this crap is when I‚Äôm in the grocery store or shopping in a near by larger town when I see people in muzzles.</p>
