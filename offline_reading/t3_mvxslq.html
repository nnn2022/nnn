    <strong>When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty</strong>
    <p><p>Sent to me by my brother. Wish I had the actual patch, but this is cool nonetheless! We have a duty to rebel against the tyranny of masks, shutdowns, forced vaccines, vaccine passports and everything else having to do with the PLAN-demic! </p>
<p>Rebellion need not be violent, nor destructive,. We need not march loudly in the streets, tipping over cars and burning buildings for that accomplishes nothing but harming others and closing down the very businesses that would otherwise align with us. </p>
<p>Every time we refuse to wear a mask in public, every time we walk purposefully and confidently into a store or business with a liberated face, every time we gather with our friends and family for a meal or BBQ or birthday party, every time a pastor holds services at full regular capacity in spite of local ordinances to the contrary... we rebel against the new tyranny. </p>
<p>This is our call to duty. We are Americans and Canadians and BROTHERS AND SISTERS in the face of tyranny, we are patriots, and patriots don't hide behind a mask or cower in our homes, and we will not allow ourselves and our particularly our children and grandchildren to be defeated and robbed of our freedoms</p>

        <p>Exactly, and they are probably even more effective than massive demonstrations. What takes more firefighting resources and time for instance, fighting a large blaze in one building, or running around all over the place, putting out little pop-up "trash fires" like a game of Whack-a-Mole?</p>

        <p>Let's look at your logic. You said that I would choose to eat a stranger's ass because I said that " I'd bet a Krispy Kreme donut that the ass gets washed more often than the dirty piece of cloth". Where did I say that I would do either one, just because I believe that one is cleaner than the other? Let's use a different example. Suppose you offer me 2 pieces of meat. One is old and has been sitting on the counter at room temperature for 2 days. The other fell on the ground, in the dirt, and you picked it up and rinsed it off. I may perceive that the rinsed meat is "more sanitary" (cleaner) than the meat that sat out for 2 days.</p>
<p>But suppose also that I'm a vegetarian. I wouldn't eat either one, even though I would perceive that one piece of meat as being cleaner than the other. I am free to choose neither action... eat the ass, or wear the dirty cloth. I am also free to have an opinion on which might be the better option for those who are choosing between the two, even if I exercise neither option myself, and choose a different option (that is, not eating meat).  Thus, I choose neither one or the other, and your statement presents a logical fallacy known as "false dilemma".</p>

        <p>Thankfully, after reading your response, both you and I can feel at ease that you do NOT in fact, choose to eat a strangers ass. </p>
<p>230 words of fervent defense has certainly made your position clear. I stand corrected and embarrassed by my premise that you may indeed prefer to eat a strangers ass, over wearing your own mask. You have my up vote as a formal apology for inferring your preference of ass eating strangers.</p>
