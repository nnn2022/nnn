        <p>Facemasks and Hygiene
Facemasks were a popular preventative measure employed during the 1918 pandemic. While people were unsure of the etiological agent of the pandemic, the consensus was that it was an airborne disease and wearing a facemask would prevent infections (Crosby, 1976). Accordingly, many cities and regions, including Guatemala City, San Francisco, and certain prefectures of Japan, made wearing a facemask in public places obligatory, and special task forces and education campaigns were established to enforce this regulation (Crosby, 1976; Rice and Palmer, 1993; Rice, 2011). However, in order for a facemask to be at least partially effective against influenza virus it must be (i) worn at all times, (ii) properly made and fitted, and (iii) made of appropriate material. The surgical gauze masks of 1918 often failed to meet these criteria (Crosby, 1976). <strong>Thus, the mortality rate of Ontario, Canada (where wearing a mask was voluntary) was not significantly different from Alberta, Canada, (where mask wearing was enforced by law) (MacDougall, 2007).In fact, influenza deaths in Alberta continued to rise even after mask wearing was sanctioned by law, suggesting that in 1918 wearing a facemask was not sufficient to prevent deaths from influenza</strong> (World Health Organization Writing Group et al., 2006).</p>
<p>Proper hygiene (e.g., frequent hand washing) would also have helped limiting the spread of the influenza virus during the 1918 pandemic, as influenza viruses are transmissible via hand to face contact (World Health Organization Writing Group et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 2014). Thus, the Japanese traditional attitude to disease and illness might have contributed to a lower national pandemic mortality in 1918–19, as Japanese children are taught to remove their shoes and wash their hands upon re-entering the home (Rice and Palmer, 1993).</p>
<p>In the context of modern influenza pandemics, facemasks and handwashing/hand sanitizers have been used as preventative, non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, during the 2009 influenza pandemic for the most part, the use of facemasks was not obligatory (CDC, 2009). Rather, the CDC only recommended facemasks for individuals at increased risk of severe illness from influenza and/or individuals who were the direct careers of persons infected with the pandemic virus (CDC, 2009). <strong>Moreover, the effectiveness of facemasks in preventing the transmission of influenza virus remains unclear (Cowling et al., 2010) and just as was observed in 1918, low public compliance significantly limits the utility of facemasks in a modern pandemic setting (Cowling et al., 2010).</strong> Perhaps such interventions will be of greatest relevance to medical personal, who serve in the front line of a pandemic and are at high risk for infection. In contrast, handwashing and the use of hand sanitizers (whether or not in combination with wearing a facemask) had a clear protective effect during the influenza pandemic of 2009 (Larson et al., 2012; Suess et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2014).</p>
<p>These data suggest that non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, handwashing/hand sanitizers, and facemasks in any future influenza pandemic may buy valuable time before vaccines become widely available. <strong>However, the success of these interventions will depend upon their early and continuous implementation and also people's willingness to comply. The 1918 pandemic has shown that measures are most effective when they are voluntary, as people have low tolerance for mandatory health measures (Spinney, 2017). Indeed, a behavioral study showed that individuals were more likely to wear a facemask when they received autonomy-supportive advice as compared to controlled instructions (Chan et al., 2015)</strong></p>
