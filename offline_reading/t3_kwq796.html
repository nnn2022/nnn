    <strong>Is anyone optimistic about 2021?</strong>
    <p><p>I see a lot of people on here saying 2021 will be much worse than 2020, with more lockdowns, masks, forced vaccinations, etc. That could certainly be the case. But who here is actually optimistic about this coming year? I'm pretty much on the fence at this point, but here are my hopes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The power hungry politicians got Trump out of office so they will start reopening their economies (e.g. Cuomo).</li>
<li>The vaccine starts to work or they will change how cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are counted to make it look like the vaccine is working. Many doomers start taking the vaccine and the WHO's <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19">new and improved</a> definition of herd immunity starts to take effect, thereby allowing businesses to reopen.</li>
<li>Summer will make it look like covid is over. We saw in 2020 cases fall right after the peak in March/April, and once summer comes around again cases will drop and people will be outside not giving a fuck about covid anymore.</li>
<li>Businesses continue resisting lockdowns making it harder to shut down everyone.</li>
<li>Schools reopen.</li>
<li>Covid fatigue sets in. By this I mean people will be done with masks, social distancing, lockdowns, and just want to be normal again. They won't be afraid of the virus anymore given it'll be more than a year since we've had to deal with all this bullshit. And hopefully they won't be wearing masks at the fucking park.</li>
</ul>
<p>2021 certainly hasn't started off great politically, and this year could certainly be a shit show. Or it could be a turning point back to the old normal as people start waking up. I'm really hoping for the latter. What are your thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>They'll make a certain politician who's not accomplished shit in 40+ years look like a hero, thanks to his 100 day mask mandate and they'll in that time, crank down the Cycle Threshold on PCR test, "oh hrmm vaxx's and masks must be working". Doomers will now praise their new God of THE ScIeNcE, Sleepy Joe</p>

        <p>Ya know what to be honest with you, that dipshit doesn't deserve any praise but I'm for it too. Lots more will soon be hesitant even if masks didn't go away but "cases" and deaths started declining, fatigue will set it pretty quick. It's hard to believe but it'll have to happen lol</p>

<p>Like you, I want to believe the latter too. I'm not sure though, I can see the goalposts being moved yet again in the UK. I can see restrictions being in place all year "to protect everyone else", after the vulnerable are vaccinated.</p>
<p>This will be absolutely unacceptable and I do everything in my power to make that not be the case. In 4 days, we will have been under some form of lockdown for 300 days in the UK. We need to be seeing the end of this, not more unnecesarry restrictions.</p>

        <p>Indeed, there are supposed to be local elections for Police and Crime Commissioners (people who are in charge of the Police forces in the UK), among other things, in May. I've heard rumours of these being delayed, I sincerely hope not as I want to vote someone into office who will stop the Police enforcing these restrictions.</p>

        <p>I’m very optimistic.  It’s just going to a few months to get there, which has been the case all along. <br>
I think people are expecting July-ish to be when we’re more or less done with this.  I know the goal posts seem to get moved a lot but this isn’t March. You’re adding in vaccines and a year+ of doing this.   My bet is just in time for schools, day to day life is very much normal. </p>
<p>There are a lot of complaints about the federal government right now. Those complaints land on Biden’s doorstep in a few days.  You can only blame the previous admin for so long before people get tired of hearing it.  Covid fatigue will be very real.  Heck, look around you now.  Tell me a lot of people aren’t done already.</p>

        <p>No. I don't have any hope about the vaccine letting us return to normal, neither government will. A new crisis with huge level of fearmongering is the most possible scenario i'm thinking of.</p>

<p>Well, according to the Event 201 exercise, this is set to occur in 2025...</p>
<p>&rt; The power hungry politicians got Trump out of office so they will start reopening their economies (e.g. Cuomo).</p>
<p>Then what about all the other countries in the world? Basically every developed nation and even third world countries have restrictions of some kind, most of which are becoming harsher, not lessened. </p>
<p>And let's say, sure, all of what's happening was every country in the world getting together with the US Democrats to oust Trump, and there is no other agenda at play at all. Think about how scary that prospect is. Imagine every world leader acting like petty high school girls, plotting get rid of the "ugly girl" they don't like (aka Trump), and using the rest of the billions of people on Earth as pawns. Imagine that scenario. Is that really much better? Do you really think the world will just go back to normal under psychopaths like that?</p>
<p>Though I really doubt this was stricly about Trump anyway.</p>

        <p>You’re totally right. Even though covid is extremely political, it’s different for every country - a lot of them couldn’t care less who gets elected in the US in terms of their covid situation. Although everyone can see right through the dickhead governing New York.</p>

        <p>I'm hopeful.</p>
<p>One, any autocracies governments may seek to create out of the COVID-19 crisis are doomed: 3.5% of people need to be engaged in sustained civil disobedience to guarantee success, and the number who would consistently breach lockdown (not to go to piss-ups or anything: just to protect mental health and see their family) is between 23% and 60%.</p>
<p>Two, there is no reason to trust the sincerity of people who seem to want crushing lockdowns forever. They can only hope for such a thing because they work from home, live with friends or family, and have an army of gig economy employees to brave the killer pandemic for them. When - not if, when - those circumstances change, they'll go back to mocking the disease like they were in March 2020 ('boomer remover,' they called it...).</p>
<p>Three, any high-level interests who may wish to reshape society - it's not a conspiracy theory; that's what high-level interests do... - are relying on big data against the tide of actual developments in the zeitgeist. Artificially removed from anyone who leads a normal life, they have no direct access to their 'enemy' (i.e. the arch-defenders of the way things are, normal folk). It's a counter-strategic position that shows them less of the puzzle the more they push.</p>

        <p>I'll remain cautiously optimistic. We've seen how well that's played out so far. I do have a lot of fear about just how stupid people are.</p>

        <p>It’s only going to get better around November when more vaccines are made and given. So yes you can write off this year too because by the time it gets better and we start to have normal back then it’s going to be 2022. Two years gone</p>

        <p>I’m very optimistic, but I also live in a Republican controlled state. Pandemics don’t last forever and generally, people seem to want their old lives back. </p>
<p>What makes me seriously worried about the future is all the censorship by big tech. That’s really gonna screw up our democracy and isn’t really compatible with anything I’d call a free society.</p>
