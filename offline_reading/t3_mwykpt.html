    <strong>No one cares about the children</strong>
    <p><p>For the past year, children all over the world have been psychologically abused and conditioned to think all of this is normal when it isn't. Depending on where you live right now, schools have been flip-flopping between online and in-person education for the last year and at this point, are learning absolutely nothing but state propaganda regarding covid.</p>
<p>My younger brother (8th grade), called me out of the blue a couple days ago, crying and overall depressed about how they treat him at school because he sometimes takes his mask off to breathe (he has asthma). They force children to mask up for the entire day, including outdoor recess. My brother was playing basketball with his friends (all masking), and eventually he took it off to catch his breath, because physical excersize can sometimes trigger his asthma. The recess supervisor threatened that if he took it off one more time then he won't have recess anymore. Well the next time he needed to breathe some fresh fucking air after exerting energy, he went further into the field completely alone and took it off. The supervisor made him stop recess and go on a walk with her the entire time, essentially parading him and publicly shaming him in front of his classmates while they were playing. The supervisor started grilling him as to why he doesn't wear the mask and he said that he has severe asthma (carries inhaler and epipen) and seasonal allergies, to which she replied "Fair enough, but you should still wear one"</p>
<p>How is that okay? Teachers and staff at the school have been bullying him for months now and my parents' complaints to the school have all went to the void. Admin suggested if he can't wear a mask due to his asthma then they would have to segregate him from his class or do online schooling at home. Honestly fuck public education, and I hate how they're ostracizing my brother from his classmates and friends. Everyday he comes home saying he doesn't want to go to school anymore. Do they not realize that this kind of behaviour is exactly why they turn kids off from school??</p>
<p>Sorry for the rambling, but literally no one in public policy or the doomer Karens acknowledge what these lockdowns have done to our children.</p></p>

        <p>Also to add how the hell is exercising with a mask on hygienic? All that sweat and bacteria building up, then breathing it right back in is fucking disgusting and is exactly how people get sick.</p>

        <p>FUCK!!!!! That makes me so furious to read!!! I swear those fucking teachers and child supervisors are just fucking predators enjoying a fake authority over people so young they can't defend themselves. I'm so mad for your brother. Tell him I say my biggest regret from school years was not standing up to cunts like that. I would encourage him to break covid rules shamelessly, because he's too young to get in real trouble and they aren't allowed to physically make him do anything anyways. Fuck it, life is too short to get bullied by assholes. Ugh those shit stains grind my gears!!!</p>

        <p>Thank you, and I told him the exact same thing. He has to stand up for himself and to take off the mask whenever he needs to. Everything they say is just empty threats, the worst they can do is suspend him and even that's a blessing cuz he can just do school at home, not deal with their shit, and play as much basketball on the driveway with his friends as he wants without the face diaper.</p>

        <p>Omg I agree with you 100%. I’m assisting in a 2nd grade class rn, and it’s so sad because aside from the masks, an even bigger problem is that the teacher keeps saying this is the lowest ability class she’s ever had because 1st grade basically didn’t happen for them. And if their parents aren’t able to teach them at home, they just didn’t learn anything. In a class of 20 2nd graders, 8 cannot read or write. 8. It’s so sad. We’re trying to catch them up obviously but we already know 2 are being retained next year. It’s heartbreaking.</p>

        <p>I don't know what the fuck so many parents are still doing sending their kids to school. Find some other parents and hire STEM tutors for 3 hours a day. Let them play outside the rest of the day. You'll get better education and your kids will be healthier, happier and free from critical-theory and all the other garbage they preach in state schools.</p>
