        <p>"Conspiracy theory" does not mean, "wrong." </p>
<p>The Holocaust is a conspiracy theory. It's based on strong evidence that the Nazis conspired to exterminate the Jews.</p>
<p>You know what's not a theory? Evolution. There's not strong enough evidence for it to be a theory. It's a far-fetched hypothesis. There is no evidence that a species has ever transformed into another species. You can breed dogs for intelligence for centuries and they will remain dogs, and they will never gain the ability to speak English.</p>

        <p>&rt;The Holocaust is a conspiracy theory</p>
<p>Not true, sorry. The Holocaust is made up of known events. Saying that it's a theory would suggest that there are other possibilities, or that it maybe didn't happen. It did happen, and as you said there's strong evidence.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;There is no evidence that a species has ever transformed into another species.</p>
<p>What about us? What about life in general? We are related to apes, but they did not exist forever. Life once started on earth with one-cell organism, and over all these years developed to us existing.</p>
<p>Of course you can't teach a dog to speak english, because to do such an extraordinary thing requires more than just a couple of generations of humans. For a dog to start talking you'd have to wait a veeeery long time. We already helped to evolve dogs, in the beginning there was one or maybe a couple of races. Poodles, Sausage Dogs etc. were selectively bred by us.</p>

        <p>The Holocaust hinges on intention, and there is only strong evidence of said intention. There is no video of Hitler saying, "exterminate the Jews." Witness testimony is not definitive proof, nor are documents presented by Germany's enemies that contain certain euphemisms. They're strong evidence, but they don't make something irrefutable fact. Beyond a reasonable doubt = / = fact. </p>
<p>I think it happened, but I can't point to anything as it pertains to it and say it's certain. </p>
<p>Whereas I can demonstrate the sky is blue.</p>
<p>And it's not about "teaching" dogs to speak; it's about them evolving the ability to learn.</p>
<p>We breed plenty of dogs for intelligence, yet there seems to be a clear limit as to how smart they can get. They microevolve, as seen with the various breeds, but they remain dogs. They can mate with each other and they can't mate with any other species.</p>

        <p>&rt; There is no video of Hitler saying, "exterminate the Jews." </p>
<p>Are you suggesting that the Nazis killed millions of people in concentration camps, and all that behind Hitler's back, without him ordering to do it? We don't need a video of Hitler saying that they will start killing all jews, there is more than enough other evidence that it happened.</p>
<p>I mean tend to agree with you a bit. The winners make the narrative,  yadda yadda yadda. But that technically means, that you can't really believe any historical happening. </p>
<p>There are countless logbooks from concentration camps, letters, books, films, diaries, witnesses etc. So were all these things fabricated?</p>
<p>What about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tGwjwK9pIM">this video</a>? <strong>ATTENTION: VERY GRAPHIC.</strong> Was that faked by the winners?</p>

        <p>I would recommend you an educational visit to Bergen-Belsen and to the museum there. The Nazis were particular precise in bookkeeping this crap. No room for error, so no theory, rather a proven fact. </p>
<p>The second part of your statement I do not know were to begin. The reason for that is that you do not seem to grasp the basic concept of species and the time Evolution takes. But looking at your username is pretty much self explanatory</p>

        <p>It's actually the opposite. The Nazis were discreet about it. They spoke in euphemisms. </p>
<p>Additionally, something that can not be directly observed can never be more than a theory. </p>
<p>No, <em>you</em> don't seem to grasp the absurd amount of time it would take for all of the alleged changes to take place. </p>
<p>Tell me this: We breed dogs for intelligence all the time. When will a new dog-derived species that can speak English evolve?</p>
<p>Everyone intuitively knows this won't happen. Ever. </p>
<p>Just like everyone knows we'll never be able to generate life from inorganic matter. If scientists knew how this happened, they would be able to do it themselves. But they have no answer for it. That's not good enough for a theory.</p>

        <p>Here’s the problem. People “critically think” on things that really don’t require critical thinking. Wearing a mask is just common sense. Reduces spread of disease. Slows the pandemic. Keeps the people around you safe. And at the sacrifice of what? Having to wear a piece of cloth? Oh noooo! It has no negative side affects. It doesn’t lower oxygen levels (heard that a few time from our <em>critical thinkers</em> ). </p>
<p>So where does that leave us? We got a small minority of people trying to do mental gymnastics to justify why they are against things that are more-or-less common sense. </p>
<p>It makes you look like an idiot. When you say the government is trying to control you by wearing a mask — you look like a conspiracy lunatic. </p>
<p>Put that critical thinking towards things that actually require critical thinking. Trying to fight common sense exposes the ding dong fraud that you are.</p>
