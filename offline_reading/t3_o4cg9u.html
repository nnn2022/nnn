    <strong>An apparent plot hole if this forced vaccination is an intentional scheme. Help me think it through.</strong>
    <p><p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I'm sure you've seen me around here. You know what I'm about. </p>
<p>So here's the thing, right? If this is some conspiracy to commit mass murder, as some purport. Who exactly is the bad actor here? Because if the bad actors are the people who are pro-mask, pro-lockdown, and pro-vaccine then those folks are... Working to off themselves and everyone who agrees with them? That doesn't exactly become the ruling class. </p>
<p>Because if those are the ones who are going to be so afflicted by this, then the survivors are all of us. The obstinent, stiff-necked people who don't just do what they're told. The most difficult people kind of people to rule.</p>
<p>I'm just having a hard time seeing the logic in this intentional conspiracy to commit mass harm thing.</p></p>

        <p>Well, since you were so desperate for an answer that you had to come sprinting to a subreddit you aren't active in, just to try and dunk on the straw man that the TV taught you, I'll help you out.</p>
<p>Very few people believe that that is the primary reason behind the plandemic. Personally, I favor the theory that the billions of dollars stripped from the working class, and given to the ultra-rich that coincidentally created all the rules that they profit off of, is the prime motive. </p>
<p>So pharmaceutical companies have made billions of dollars, and thenterrified populace will by the same jab every year for the rest of their lives so long as they can be kept scared. They cleared 8 billion this year, now extrapolate that across the next 50 or 60 years. </p>
<p>The media makes more money the more people are afraid. The fear porn makes them money directly. That's even without speculating on the incestuous relationship between media and politicians. </p>
<p>Walmart, Amazon, and other massive multinational corporations, and large chain restaurants have been able to weather the coof, but their competition in the small business sector has been destroyed. </p>
<p>Hospitals get massive kickbacks from the government if a patient dies 'of covid' compared to a patient that dies of anything else. This creates a conflict of interest for the hospitals. </p>
<p>Government entities have realized that, so long as they keep the citizenry afraid, they can pass whatever self-serving edicts they want. They just need to add "this could stop covid" to any bill. That's why, for example, the 'relief package' last year was stalled until democrats could earmark a couple hundred million for things that fed back into their own pockets.</p>

        <p>Okay, listen man...  </p>
<p>\&rt;&rt;Well, since you were so desperate for an answer that you had to come sprinting to a subreddit you aren't active in  </p>
<p>I post in here. I comment in here. That's not a matter of opinion. You can look at my account history and see that. It's pure fact. So cool it.   </p>
<p>\&rt;&rt;just to try and dunk on the straw man that the TV taught you  </p>
<p>Ease up with assuming that I'm not on your side. I am just as much against forced covid vaccines and dangling the return to the real normal because the paywall of having the stupid coof jab. Quite literally, I don't even watch TV or common media outlets. So that's also fallacious. Again, cool it.  </p>
<p>WRT to everything else you said, about how big corporations are the ones who are winning here and the ones who have something to gain.... I see your point and find a lot of validity on it! I didn't make this post to stir the pot. I made this post to FIND the real understanding. You don't have to bite into a brother to share the truth. We've either got to all work together here, or we're all going to sink down as a nasty, toxic sub.   </p>
<p>Genuinely, seriously, thank you for sharing your perspective on the who you think the bad actors are here. Its all I wanted to know.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's a big conspiracy to kill people. It's a conspiracy to perform a mass experiment without liability and make trillions of dollars (literally when it's all done) in the process. </p>
<p>There's no big crazy conspiracy needed to avoid the vaxx. It's <em>literally</em> an <em>experiment</em> and you don't inject your entire population with an <em>experiment.</em></p>

        <p>No one really believes the vaxx is going to kill everyone that takes it. That's a meme believed by very, very few impressionable scared people, in the same way some people think covid will kill everyone off that gets it</p>
<p>The manufacturer's though, are in fact not liable from any harm it causes, and are seeing huge profit, Pfizer has reported expected profit of around $25 Billion for vaxx sales in 2021</p>

        <p>When they control food production, banks, power, water and the production of pretty much everything else on earth it doesn't matter if the people who are left are sheep or they hate you. You still have total control. </p>
<p>That's assuming it is a plot to kill people. Sure that's a possibility but I think it's far more likely that the vaccine is simply unintentionally dangerous.</p>

        <p>Perhaps, this is financial, the markets never recovered from the financial crash of 2009. This is a fucking convenient way of intentionally collapsing the system while profiting and avoiding blame, while simultaneously tightening your grip on power over the joe normal, “oh but covid”.</p>

        <p>If your goal is population control, it doesn't really matter which half of the slaves die. </p>
<p>That said, what proof do you have that the elites that say they got jabbed had the same thing in <em>their</em> syringe as what goes in the average person's?</p>

        <p>I think about this. However I come to the conclusion that elites <em>may</em> not necessarily care about utter control, rather than just ensuring that whatever message they put out to the masses results in one thing; your money in their pocket. Which has been achieved ten fold. Perhaps culling the population was a mere result of the fact that they can get away with depopulation because they know for sure that the sheep will do what they’re told. Not only does selling billions of vaccines make them money, but killing a percentage of the population takes that money from the dead and incapacitated and creates opportunities for them to recirculate that money back into their own pockets. Thus increasing their profits further. Idk man. Shits fucked up any way you slice it</p>
