    <strong>How do you counter the stories?</strong>
    <p><p>Covid zealots always have these stories ready, about how Bob was at his wits' end because his wife has Covid and the ICUs are full.</p>
<p>Or about how Jenny's mother died, or an entire family got infected, or some young person died somewhere, etc.</p>
<p>And since I don't watch Covid!News 24/7 as they do, I can't refute such stories with evidence on my own.</p>
<p>Just how do you respond?</p></p>

        <p>Here's how you respond; </p>
<p>"I'm sorry for your loss, it's terrible when someone dies of covid." </p>
<p>And then you move on, or engage again at another time with a ringer. Like </p>
<p>OMGOSH!!! GET AWAY FROM THAT CAR!!!! I HEAR PEOPLE DIE BY THE THOUSANDS IN THOSE THINGS. RUN! RUN!</p>

        <p>Those stories could be substituted for any kind of death or harm someone has endured.</p>
<p>It depends on their personal belief on what measures should be taken to combat the virus (seeing as there's zero consensus amount the doomers as to what we need to do and for how long).</p>
<p>But generally, I always just make the conversation about logic, because that's what Covid is about to me. I focus on staying home if you're so terrified and paranoid, and how all of the mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns have done far more harm than good at this point.</p>

        <p>Most of them are fake or misrepresented. My stylist told me two of her sisters are "dying in the ICU". Hyperbole aside, I looked at my stylist and guessed that her sisters are pretty fat too. Maybe that has something to do with it. Always take those stories with a grain of salt.</p>

        <p>I tell them that since a 116 year old nun can not only survive covid but not even notice she's sick and then laugh at it, then maybe, just maybe it was that pile of junk food, not the virus that killed whomever they're yapping about. And then if I feel particularly playful, I tell them to invest in a fuckin stepper</p>

        <p>you can't answer lies, it's that simple. all of us who are there, we never had anyone sick around us, it's not like we were lying about it. most of us would put on hazmat suits and disinfect everything in our path, if there was a real pandemic, we're not suicidal, we're just not jerks and we don't like elaborate lies to keep us on a leash.<em>📷</em></p>

        <p>Well, anyone else remember that a year ago, lockdowns were to 'flatten the curve' because hospitals couldn't handle the numbers, so they needed time to build up? Then some got emergency facilities to deal with the increase in patients. </p>
<p>The silent part- they went unused &amp; then were dismantled. So, WHY are ICUs "full"? Because hospitals laid off staff due to lack of work!!! Why did "Jenny's mother" die? Because a hospital administrator decided her life wasn't worth the money! Remember when Trump got Covid &amp; got supposedly "expensive treatment not available to Americans"? Hmmmm.... Sounds like deliberate witholding of treatment to me! Oh, wait, in Britain the NHS admitted that they were deliberately letting "some people" die. Gotta pump up those death tolls!!! That's just the tip though. The rest of the iceberg is the admission all deaths that are 'presumed Covid' or tested even 28 days earlier, for ANY reason gets counted as Covid. </p>
<p>So, let's use that metric for cars. Any death, of any reason, within 28 days of being in a car is counted as 'car death'.</p>

        <p>Where I live (a big metro), they closed two hospitals and one ER in the last 6 months. I believed they closed the hospitals about a month before they shut all the restaurants down again. Barely a blip in the news when the hospitals closed. Did I miss a protest? No one organized one. A donation link to keep the hospitals open during a pandemic? I didn't see anything like that. The doomers I talk to have ZERO idea hospitals in THEIR CITY closed!!!  I don't even know how to talk to some people anymore.  Talking to doomers is similar to trying to get through to an addict. They keep pushing the needle deeper into their vein and change the story of why they are doing it as well as make irrational excuses for their behavior. :(</p>

        <p>You respond to people? I’ve just embraced being an asshole. They’re going to think that’s what I am no matter what I do or say anyway so what’s the point in trying to be nice? Someone tells me I’m a dick bc I won’t wear a mask? Ok than I’m a dick. Nothing you can do about it. I’m not going to let words or “shaming” bother me. There is a chance that some dipshit might assault me in public unprovoked because they’re frustrated by my confidence. That’s why I conceal carry.</p>
