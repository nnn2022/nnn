        <p>I hadn’t looked there. The internet outside of this sub is full of people who drank the kool aid and are waiting for their kool aid booster shot. Very soon, I hope, there will be a tidal wave of information and litigation about mandatory vaccinations and passports. I have said this before and I will say this again, if stopping Covid was the goal, then we should be looking for the existing drugs that stop Covid, testing them and distributing them to anyone who doesn’t want to be vaccinated but is willing to take already safety tested drugs. End of story.</p>

        <p>I think most conservatives would trip over themselves to try to rebrand as more progressive than the liberals. And my advice to them would be to say that when you're not being authentic, you don't make great choices based on conviction. 
I honestly don't know what to vote anymore. More than ever, each party is just the same stuff repackaged in either blue, red, orange or green. 
You will get the same policies from each.</p>

        <p>I agree, completely. It’s like spin the bottle on who to vote for. Personally, there are very few politicians who really appeal to me. Derek Sloan actually has some balls and is going after some issues. But sadly, 99% of politicians seem to be a waste of money and whatever is going on with this vaccine, many of them seem to be in the pocket of someone else. They aren’t working for us.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't know what to think. My husband is scared of covid, my one son wanted the vaccine badly, and another says he won't take it.</p>
<p>This whole thing is unreal. Nobody can agree on what would or would not be appropriate solutions to the problems brought to us by the pandemic; some people can't even figure out whether to be scared for their health; conflicting news stories all the time; flip flopping experts and advice; blame game as to orgin of virus; politicization at every single level in so many countries; everybody has conflicting anecdotes, and where personal anecdotes are involved its an unfortunate truth that most will believe what they see with their own eyes over the proclaimed truths that strangers tell about i.e. one person sees everybody they know that got it pull through with hardly any symptoms and compete recovery... whilst someone else knows a couple that died of covid despite being at least visibly healthy and fit. </p>
<p>This whole thing is so fucked beyond measure. And it is complicated moreso that every individual that views the situation has their own perspectives/philosophy on life and death and so would choose different actions that would conflict with someone else's chosen path. </p>
<p>And then you have to look for answers to all of these problems by looking to politicians to handle it, and we know theyre fallible and corruptible and they have party interests that may contend with the people's interests. And scandals, to top it off!</p>
<p>I just smoked a J for the first time in years and I really don't know where (or if) I was going anywhere with that...</p>

        <p>You’re right about all of it. But it’s very simple. The vaccine doesn’t stop a person from getting it or transmitting it. There are existing drugs known to help reduce the effect of the virus and drugs that have a safety record on humans that are being researched for use to kill Covid. If this was all about stopping Covid, you would hear the media talking about other options on the horizon. </p>
<p>We have all as a population been very well behaved. That does not mean that the politicians are the boss of us. That means that we have agreed as a group with reasonable measures based on the best information available at the time. We are a reasonable population, but turning the vaccinated against the unvaccinated serves no one. </p>
<p>The vaccination passport is a patent waste of money.</p>

        <p>Nova Scotia, where the head Doctor doesnt believe in lyme disease. </p>
<p>And I cant find a Doctor who can read data sheets and recognize the irregular heartbeat that I was experiencing. These people.... its a mistake to trust your lives to them.</p>

<p>To this day, they still are telling me refrigerant cant cause irregular heartbeat. So yeah, I dont trust a damn thing anyone in this place says anymore.</p>
