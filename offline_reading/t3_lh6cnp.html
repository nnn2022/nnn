    <strong>‚ÄúFriend‚Äù claims that I killed her grandma</strong>
    <p><p>Like the quotations suggest, we are no longer friends any more. She blamed me for spreading the virus to her family when I was at her house to eat dinner with them. She knows my stance on masks and this whole phony lockdown. She is the classic government boot licker and will probably wear two masks just like the CDC is apparently now saying. Anyways, I was not wearing a mask that day I came to eat and they all were. She says in the next week all of them developed symptoms but her grandmas were apparently the worst and she eventually passed. While I do feel sad for her losing her grandma, to blame this on me and a fake pandemic is absurd. She was already super old. And after all, all i had was a small cough and if they were all wearing masks what‚Äôs the issueü§®. Anyways just wanted to share in case others had crazy stories like mineüòÇ.</p></p>

        <p>Your lack of compassion for the death of that woman is distasteful. Whilst it would have been impossible everyone at the dinner table to keep their masks on whilst eating, the idea that you would laugh whilst deliberately attending with your cough is insensitive. My verdict is that people like you cannot exist and that you are trolling the sub.</p>

        <p>You could ask how they all got sick if they were wearing masks, or why they let you over in the first place, it let's be honest, she's not in a good place anyway and now isn't the time for that discussion. Whether this ends the friendship permanently or is something you can fix in time can wait. Of you want to try, be supportive, if not, move on. </p>
<p>Obviously there's no reason to assume you're the source of their illness or that it was covid at all, even if there were a pcr test administered, so you shouldn't feel any worse than any other time we've exposed friends and family to colds, flus, etc.</p>

        <p>I think people need to be reminded that old people die of old age, everybody is so focused on covid they forget old people die of natural death of old age and she can't blame you either.</p>
<p>But don't worry about it too much one day the mainstream media might spill the truth it was all exaggerated and she will be the one saying "sorry" for blaming you.</p>

        <p>You can't even manage to understand the impacts of the nature of PCR tests and the reliance thereon to determine cause of death.  Even the UK in plain text lists their mortality as "people who have died from ANY CAUSE within 28 days of a positive PCR test."  All you see is the number, and can't think beyond it.  How many of those millions even had covid when they died?  Since PCR can't tell us that, according to modern experts, the inventor of PCR, and even Fauci ("at 35 cycles all you're finding are dead RNA fragments"), the number is meaningless.  You have been fooled.  And you revel in it.</p>
