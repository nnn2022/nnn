    <strong>Comunism has never been closer</strong>
    <p><p>First of all this is just my opinion of course, and last I checked we were still entitled to our own opinions (although many reddit users would disagree). </p>
<p>As a person from a country that recently escaped communism I find it alarming how freely we give up our rights and freedoms our parents/grandfathers/fought so hard to protect. Freedoms that we give away because of fear. I smell a scent communism in the air. What gives it away you may ask? </p>
<p>• <em>Propaganda</em> via media channels, pro mask, pro vaccine etc. The dramatism and theatrics are there. i can not even turn on the news cause it makes me sick. The bias is staring me in the face. Journalists do not report objectively, they regurgitate their subjective beliefs as the general truth.</p>
<p>• <em>Censoring</em> - news that do not fit the agenda, like anti mask protests (like the ones in european cities). Now the censoring crossed on socialmedia. The narrative is controlled, and what foes not fit it is removed under the fake news excuse. Did you know that facebook allows pro vaccine ads but bans all anti vaccine ads? Just a thought.</p>
<p>• <em>Inconsistency/disinformation</em> - have you seen how many times they changed their story since the beginning? No asymptomatics are not contagious. Nevermind they are. Masks only for sick people/ who show symptoms, no need for the rest. Oh wait, no everyone must wear them “just to be sure”. Only inside, there’s no contamination outside in open spaces. Oh wait nope, there is now. Everywhere. All flu cases are covid cases, the numbers are inflated and somehow this is ok</p>
<p>• <em>Leading by fear</em> (the mind killer). Why the hysteria though? Exaggerating the language and inflating the numbers. Covid is the “virus killer”, people infected are the “virus’ victims”. They show the “total” number of infected people without subtracting the healthy / cured cases or what they later find were false positives that they deem “asymptomatic”. All flu cases are covid cases and the numbers grow and grow. The panic spreads. And they trive on panic. Keeps the people in check. </p>
<p>•  <em>The Cancel culture</em> that people WILLINGLY participate impose social coercion. The communist party actually had a motto on this <em>you are either with us or against us</em> . You do not have the option to have an opinion different than the one that they agreed upon. Dare to have one and prepare for the instant fame, wrath of the internet, career over and reputation in the bin - you are cancelled. </p>
<p>• <em>Informants</em> - citizens informing the police of other citizens (neighbours, strangers etc) that “do not respect the law/rules”. They can publicly acuse, report, or try to forcibly impose the “rules” upon the undesirables. They see themselves as an extention of the law - helping the system stay in place.</p>
<p>• <em>State police</em> - Enforcing the laws, imposing curfews, monitorization. Making sure dangerous criminals like non masked wearers are off the streets.</p>
<p>• <em>Isolation</em> - reatraining the social circle, Banning gatherings. </p>
<p>Sorry for the long post. Needed to vent my anxiety.
I invite an open discussion on this.</p></p>

        <p>Communism and democracy are two sides of the same coin , both were pushed on society by same group of people , they experimented both systems to see which works better , it's like 1984 and Brave New World</p>

        <p>Sure, these things have been happening for a while, totally unconnected to the virus.  Countries currently and in the past didn't just become dystopian hellholes out of nowhere.  It's part of human nature.  In the U.S. we like to think we're immune from that, but the insanity that leftists have displayed over the past few years has proven we are not.  They have authoritarian tendencies.  You find that this year more in the reaction to the Floyd situation than the virus.  </p>
<p>The main thing for the country is to make sure that they never have an elected, enforceable foothold to actually become that "sjw <em>1984</em>"-type scenario that we all fear.</p>

        <p>Well also with trump.  I think his election broke something in the collective collectivist/leftist mind; that's why it's called Trump Derangement Syndrome.  Its symptom is more extreme leftist behavior, leading to chilling things like a member of comrade sanders' circle/cult discussing the idea of re-education gulags.</p>

        <p>you must be from the States. Anticommunism seems to be  a part of your national mythos/religion. This is why you confuse corporate fascism with communism.</p>

        <p>You're describing a dystopian authoritarian state. Not communism. The two just fit well together. Almost all of your points run through one catch-all authority: The unbridled corporate consumerism of mass media. Which is very far from communist.</p>

        <p>Communism is a political theory. Authoritarian is a trait. It's not a word game to say. It's just... words.... and how they're intended to be used. You people are some of the dumbest people I've ever talked to. I'm going to delete all my posts in here tomorrow so I don't get any more replies. But I need you to see this now.
