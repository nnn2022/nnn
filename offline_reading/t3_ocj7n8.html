    <strong>Is the long COVID a myth?</strong>
    <p><p>I am 22 years old male. I decided to take a first jab without doing research, because I was scared of so told long COVID side effects to young people (I personally heard those stories from the known people). They said that after COVID their lungs were damaged, they could not feel taste or their heart was damaged. </p>
<p>After taking a first Moderna shot I felt a really increased heart beat and extreme weakness. I was really afraid to the point of crying and desperation. Luckily it all passed after 3-4 days. I am back to normal for know and feel great (i meditate so I believe I have a better understanding on my body and it's state)</p>
<p>I decided not to take a second jab and live happily, without possibly encounting a heart disease (quite a lot of young people got heart inflammation after second shot). However I am still scared of those long COVID side effects.</p>
<p>Is this really possible? Or perhaps these young people already had bad health? I mean it is rare to see a young person, who exercises well and has a decent diet (most of the diets out there are wrong). So I am really confused and have limited amount of data.</p>
<p>Thanks! Good sub learned a lot</p></p>

        <p>I had it and recovered without lasting effects. You can tell its bullshit though because 'the experts' were making that prediction very early into this with very little data. It's a scare tactics.  It's like the fantasy of asymptomatic spread.... a crazy theory, that studies seem to disprove....yet... thats what masks are about...bullshit scare tactics ALL of it.</p>

        <p>Everybody I know that's caught it has recovered and were back to 100% within 2 weeks. The only exceptions to this were my older sister and my little sisters husband. Both are over weight and didn't exactly take care of themselves. My older sister has fully recovered, it drug on for about 2 months for her. My little sisters husband was in critical condition for well over 2 months. I haven't followed up though. So, no update on him.</p>

        <p>Sure, that's a reasonable suspicion when the symptoms align.  Heart inflammation and blood clots aren't anxiety symptoms.</p>

        <p>Definitely, although neither is loss of taste and wheezing. It's good to just be equally skeptical regardless of the situation.</p>

        <p>Try and stay positive. I know it might be hard. If I were you I would take a multi vitamin and a 1000mg vitamin C tablet daily. This is something I do everyday and have done for years and haven't been sick in years. It builds your immune system naturally.</p>

Bookmark and use it occasionally for the rest of your life. Some of the best websites are the ones that look a bit old-fashioned. Basically vitamins are your friends. But big pharma can't make money with them. I cannot stress enough take vitamin c daily for the rest of your life. It's the simplest cheapest way to improve and maintain health.</p>

        <p>We haven’t even gotten far enough along to know what the long-term effects of Covid will be. Also there’s such a thing as post viral syndrome. And this can happen with many viruses not just Covid. if you’re really sick sometimes it can take a little while to feel normal again. That’s normal.</p>

        <p>No, it's not a myth. but it's nothing new either.</p>
<p><strong>Any major injury or any major illness has 'long haul' effects on your life.</strong></p>
<p>All the 'experts' did was take what was already known, and packaged it as something 'discovered' in order to fearmonger certain age groups (at the time 20-29 year olds pre September 2020) to encourage them to comply with mandates, Masks and getting tested.</p>
<p>The thing is MOST people do not suffer from covid19 directly anyway, and make up a small percentage. What does the CDC say?</p>
<p>"Conditions contributing to deaths where COVID-19 was listed on the death certificate"</p>
<h1>1 Influenza (the flu) and pneumonia</h1>
<h1>2 Respiratory failure</h1>
<h1>3 Hypertensive diseases</h1>
<h1>4 Diabetes</h1>
<p>"For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. 
For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19,

        <p>Yeah long term effects from covid are undeniable at this point and there’s a variety of symptoms that can linger. In particular, if your not healthy to begin with and you end up in the hospital for a month it might take a while to recover. Not necessarily permanent, but may be a few months to fade away. The Dr on Weinstein’s podcast talks about this. </p>
<p>One injection should still give some protection and no one can fault you for taking a pass on the second shot after a bad rxn like that.</p>

        <p>There's no reason to disbelieve the professionals reporting concerning long-term symptoms of COVID. And to your question, it's been indicated that the severity of a person's infection has a lot to do with the amount of their exposure. So it would make sense that generally unhealthy people might get worse symptoms, but that's certainly not the only factor.</p>
<p>Regardless, as someone who has been vaccinated, even just once, you don't have much to worry about as long as you continue to take whatever health measures are appropriate for you.</p>
