    <strong>Pro Vaccine people listen up</strong>
    <p><p>To each their own. If you want to get the vaccine do it!! You’ll do us all a big favor for taking one for the team. I just want y’all to move to another subreddit and leave us alone. Go make one called yesnewnormal or something. You ain’t going to change no ones mind here. Yes I’m talking to you especially you Adam smith. Comparing the mask to a fucking seatbelt. That’s how delusional and dumb y’all are. Y’all always say tHe LoNg tERm EfFecTs oF cOvId arE So bAd, but what about the long term effects of the vaccine? Oh you prolly didn’t even know, a vaccine can have long term side effects. I’m glad your granny is fine after the vaccine but cancer and blood clots don’t just pop up in a day or two. Now please go ahead and support the new normal like the little sheep you are. Just get off this subreddit I don’t wanna see your name under every post.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m not against all vaccines. I’m just against vaccines that are NOT FDA APPROVED. Also I did my research and I can only tell people to look into the Tuskegee Project. Where our so "beloved" government injected African American man with a vaccine against "bad blood". Turns out they injected over 600 man with syphilis. I could write a whole ass book about why I don’t trust the big Pharma industry but imma leave it at that.</p></p>

        <p>To be honest, I love seeing different opinions, even if it seems so far fetched to me. </p>
<p>However, most are not willing to have an intelligent discussed and then it descends into a word slinging match. 
I don't identify myself as belonging to any group, I think categorising yourself is very limiting. </p>
<p>However, what we have seen during this pandemic is the blind faith in phatma and government, to make the right decision for us. 
Science is supposed to be subject to criticism but the new normal is that you cannot question science. 
It's very sad.</p>

        <p>I agree with you and I like that you are open for discussions. Most people aren’t and that’s who my post is aiming for. If people came with actual good facts and arguments why we should get the vaccine, then I wouldn’t even be complaining. It’s the people who piss me of by just discrediting my opinion by calling me dumb or crazy.</p>

        <p>This quote I read has stuck with me and could help clarify with how you feel.</p>
<p><em>"I have yet to meet in my life someone who allowed a fact to overwhelm a belief. Once you’ve adopted a belief, facts are not welcome because what they do is, they not only indict your belief but they indict the energy that you hold that says, “I have to believe what I’m told.”</em></p>
<p>People on both sides believe in their own mind the issue as they understand it, it is almost impossible to change their belief.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you are very rare here with such attitude. Majority just downvote or insult you when you present with different opinions.</p>
<p>&rt;Science is supposed to be subject to criticism but the new normal is that you cannot question science. It's very sad.</p>
<p>I have to disagree with you. I don't think you cannot question science. I just think many people consider themselves competent enough to question it yet they are as far away from it as you can imagine. </p>
<p>Many many idiots, very uneducated people, some very stupid and unintelligent have spoken about issues they know nothing about, and have consequently spread dangerous misinformation.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not calling people stupid because for example they do not want to vaccinate, even though I think you should, I don't consider you immoral or stupid for not wanting it. However it does turn out that a lot unfortunately are that. And not just a lot on the side of "antivaxers" but on the other too. </p>
<p>So question science in a scientific way. Be objective, stay away from biases, listen to other people, don't be close minded, and most importantly, know what the hell you are talking about. You cannot question science and vaccines if you don't even know basics about biology. </p>
<p>How many times have I heard people claiming mRNA to be able to change DNA. I mean, NO, this just isn't possible and constitutes the minimum amount of knowledge people in my country need to have to pass middle school.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I'm just an average guy with an opinion. In the grand scheme of things, I don't know anything. 
Although I have done a bit of research and can probably hold a good enough debate, I am not medically trained, nor am I a scientist. However, even with knowing very little than some others, I feel comfortable to question data, narrative or opinion. </p>
<p>I think if we approach things with an open mind and be willing to learn, I think it's important to ask questions, even if you know very little about it. 
I have been fortunate enough to have had deep conversations with people that are so much more intelligent in their respective fields and in comparison. I have learnt so much from them, from questioning their experiences or beliefs and I couldn't get that from reading a book or seeing it on the internet. </p>
<p>I think nowadays, we are seeing division in our societies. Whether it's race, gender, politics or vaccines, each side is saying that the other side, is a little more dumber than they actually are.</p>
<p>My GF is pro-vaccine and is very pro Chinese government ( being that she is Chinese). We have lively debates about whats going on the world but we still have the ability to hold hands, hug and spend good times with each other. </p>
<p>There is LOTS of stupid people about but still, they are people. Humans are human and I think we should be empathetic towards each other and unite, rather than divide. 
Coming from a right leaning guy, probably pretty rare. Lol</p>

<p>I agree with that completely. But asking questions is different from claiming to know. There is a difference between "Could this vaccine cause sterility" while genuinely being curious and "this vaccine must cause sterility they are lying to us". </p>
<p>&rt;I think nowadays, we are seeing division in our societies. Whether it's race, gender, politics or vaccines, each side is saying that the other side, is a little more dumber than they actually are.</p>
<p>That is true and very sad. I think this pandemic has definitely shown how little conversation and contact certain parts of society and groups of people have. It is just tragic. The fact that we are all so connected and depend on each other yet we have so little understanding and knowledge about each other is just frightening.</p>

<p>I think SM algorithms are to blame for this.<br>
If I was a flat earther, the algorithm would show me things that confirm my beliefs and then, the echo chamber is born. 
Probably a bad example but I think this is one of the main reasons we see such division. </p>
<p>I read a book a while ago, discussing how history repeats itself every 80 years, which would mean this 'crisis' 20 year cycle 2008-2028, will be ending soon. 
This leaves me optimistic that things will change in the future.. but even if it doesn't, I'll always keep my glass half full. </p>

        <p>Dude don't spread that garbage that they are taking one for the team and we aren't doing our part. Getting the vaccine is a personal decision that only effects you. The at-risk groups are being vaccinated first and once vaccinated they face a 0.005% chance of hospitalization after infection which they are 95% immune from. You are doing nobody any favors by getting vaccinated, you are just slightly reducing an already non-existent risk.</p>

        <p>Basically, no. Two different types of vaccines entirely. Pfizer and Moderna are mRNA. AstraZeneca and J&amp;J aren’t. And, no. They’re not traditional vaccines. They are new. There hasn’t been a vaccine for human coronavirus before. There’s never been a cure for the common cold, remember?</p>

        <p>“The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is based on the virus’s genetic instructions for building the spike protein. But unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which store the instructions in single-stranded RNA, the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine uses double-stranded DNA.”</p>
<p>Novavax already has the protein , it doesn’t make your body produce it.</p>

        <p>Ok. I’m not going to argue with you on this one. If you’re comfortable with Novavax, maybe you’ll be able to get vaccinated? It has the advantage that it works against some of the most problematic variants. I’d be happy to get it myself.</p>

        <p>I’m personally not going to get any vaccine since I don’t need it. No covid vaccine prevents infection or transmission. But I do like to be informed and if someone was going to get the vaccine no matter what, I’d tell them to get the novavax one since it’s not gene therapy based. That’s an option worth highlighting</p>

        <p>The efficacy of the vaccines is debatable since there isn’t much long term data and because of the abundance of variants. Plus the immune response to actually fighting real covid and not the fake protein varies with its ability. These vaccines are symptom reducers ,  not real vaccines. And for most people….it’s not really needed</p>
