        <p>It does, you are right.</p>
<p>Did you read the scientific study or the article from the very unbiased source foreignaffairsintelligencecouncil.wordpress.com ?</p>
<p>If you read the study, you will see that it's only the RNA of the spike proteins. Exactly the same what happens when you get infected by the virus itself. Just one tiny difference: The vaccine just has the blueprint for the spike proteins, nothing else of the virus.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, it's one of the historically known adverse side effects from attempts at mRNA vaccination that were SUPPOSED to be addressed before experimenting on large portions of the population.</p>
<p>In “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology</a>,” a study less than two years old at the time of the outbreak, it shares this info about mRNA trials:</p>
<p>• ex vivo mRNA cancer treatment (where a patient’s cells are treated and then re-infused in the body) is much more effective in targeting but also more expensive than in vitro mRNA prophylactic treatments (the current vaccines): - “Ex vivo DC [dendritic cell] loading allows precise control of the cellular target, transfection efficiency and other cellular conditions, but as a form of cell therapy, it is an expensive and labour-intensive approach to vaccination. <strong>Direct injection of mRNA is comparatively rapid and cost-effective, but it does not yet allow precise and efficient cell-type-specific delivery</strong>.”</p>
<p>• mRNA inhibition of antigen can also have a negative immune response: “innate immune sensing of <strong>mRNA has also been associated with the inhibition of antigen expression and may negatively affect the immune response</strong>”</p>
<p>Another study notes that until only recent developments in the last few years, “The majority of investigations focused on DNA-based vaccines because of concerns about mRNA instability and the inefficient in vivo delivery” (“<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5987916/">Nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines</a>…”).</p>
<p>Back to the original paper, it provides additional information about recent clinical reports that were less promising:</p>
<p>• “While preclinical studies have generated great optimism about the prospects and advantages of mRNA-based vaccines, two recent clinical reports have led to more tempered expectations 22,91. <strong>In both trials, immunogenicity was more modest in humans than was expected based on animal models, a phenomenon also observed with DNA-based vaccines171, and the side effects were not trivial</strong>.”</p>
<p>• “Recent human trials have demonstrated moderate and in rare cases severe injection site or systemic reactions for different mRNA platforms22,91. <strong>Potential safety concerns that are likely to be evaluated in future preclinical and clinical studies include local and systemic inflammation, the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen, stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies and potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components</strong>."</p>
<p>• “A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms54,166 induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been <strong>associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity</strong>167,168. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.”</p>
<p>• “Another potential safety issue could derive from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination. <strong>Extracellular naked RNA has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may thus contribute to oedema</strong>” 169. [oedema is “excessive accumulation of fluid, mainly water, in the tissue spaces of the body”]</p>
<p>• “Another study showed that e<strong>xtracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation [blood clots]</strong>170. Safety will therefore need continued evaluation as different mRNA modalities and delivery systems are utilized for the first time in humans and are tested in larger patient populations.”</p>
<p>To repeat: <strong>"Safety will therefore need continued evaluation as different mRNA modalities and delivery systems are utilized for the first time in humans and are tested in larger patient populations."</strong> I don't see any real evaluation of safety happening, only the claim repeated ad infinitum that they're "safe."</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we look at the recent Israel Pfizer study, we see the actual numbers in addition to percentages, and then we see that the vaccines aren't making much of a difference in preventing hospitalization and death, which is the reason we're being sold to take the vaccine, since it doesn't necessarily prevent you from getting sick (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00947-8/fulltext)</p>
<p>"Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were:</p>
<p>• 97·2% against COVID-19-related hospitalisation (4·6 vs ,0·3 per 100000 person-days),</p>
<p>• 97·5% against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation (2·7 vs 0·2 per 100000 person-days), and</p>
<p>• 96·7% against COVID-19 related death (0·6 vs 0·1 per 100000 person-days)"</p>
<p>The 96.7% against death is a relatively small number in both groups, with 0.6 deaths per unvaccinated versus 0.1 deaths in vaccinated in every 100000 people. The hospitalization range of 4.6 to 0.3 is also low in both, which means the fatality and hospitalization rates are low in both groups, and shows we're definitely making progress toward herd immunity in BOTH vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.</p>
<p>When in doubt, opt out.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I've been refining my arguments on trolls in NNN for weeks, maybe months now. I've had a few decent counter arguments, but once I pull out the peer reviewed medical studies (no news sources, straight to the science), I don't usually hear back. It's good practice for IRL. And I always hope it helps someone.</p>

        <p>You're talking about lipid nano particles. They are absorbed by your body within hours - they are the transport of the mRNA. See here:</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-021-00281-4</p>
<p>The linked study in the report from the OP doesnt say anything about them because in this postmortem study they couldnt be measured anymore.</p>

        <p>The first guy who received the vaccine as an official vaccine, yes. But he was above 80 years old and living in a nursing home. If you compare the death rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated people it is a lower death rate among the vaccinated.</p>
<p>But he still isn't the first guy. He recieved the vaccine in december 2020, thousands of people already got it nearly half a year before him in clinical trials</p>

        <p>Just to reduce some of the confusion / provide some context to things that were not adressed in the article: When you read the medical report, you will find, that the man only received the first of two BioNTec shots and would therefore not be considered vaccinated/ immune. He was also stationend in a room with another patient. Said other patient was tested positive for covid and a day later the now deceased man was also tested postive for covid. The paper comes to the conclusion, that the man was not immune to covid, because he only received the first of the two shots required. The "viral RNA found in every organ of the body" is that of the Covid-Virus, not that of the vaccine.</p>

        <p>That’s not the conclusion. </p>
<p>“In summary, the results of our autopsy case study in a patient with mRNA vaccine confirm the view that by first dose of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity can already be induced, while sterile immunity is not adequately developed.”</p>
<p>AKA one dose provides immunity slightly but two doses would be better.</p>

        <p>So are you just going to ignore the concern about the covid vaccine safety then? </p>
<p>Nobody here thinks that vaccines in general don't work. We have serious concerns about the safety of this experimental treatment for a disease of questionable severity.</p>
