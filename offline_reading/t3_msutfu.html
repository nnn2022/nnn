    <strong>Holy shit RUSSIA is a HUGE problem</strong>
    <p><p>Iâ€™m kidding of course, this isnâ€™t CNN.</p>
<p>China owns most consumer media, has billions of dollars of influence in politics (and politicians), Tik Tok itself is a surveillance grid, along with whatever net shares they have in Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc.</p>
<p>Anyone buying the bullshit that Russia is the direct threat is fast asleep.</p>
<p>Of course, they may become a threat, as our puppet leader â€˜Bidenâ€™, or Briben as I like to call him, is making it a point to go to war with Russia.</p>
<p>And why Russia? Well, they are the last superpower aside from the U.S that has tangible nationalism. China was the chosen model for the one world government. Taking Russia out will be paramount to the NWO. </p>
<p>Good luck yâ€™all. Know your enemy. Iâ€™m seeing lots of media pointing attention to Russia this, Russia that, trump-Russia that. Itâ€™s all bullshit preppery for the sheep to paint Russia an enemy, so a war with them becomes sensical.</p></p>

        <p>Putin, despite all his faults, is one of the few world leaders that hasn't fallen in line with the NWO. All of the other African heads of state that put up a fight were assassinated last year.</p>

        <p>For anyone who wants to understand how this group works (deep state, illuminati, whatever you want to name them), I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynVqPnMQ2sI">this lecture</a> by G. Edward Griffin. I've been obsessed with this type of content since forever, and that video is the best explanation of who they are and what they are doing I've found so far.</p>
<p>Another point he makes though is that there in fact 2 groups that want this NWO. One is in the west, our "illuminati", but the russians have their own group.</p>
<p>One theory is that the Evergreen ship contained some kind of "Ox gas" that would prevent people from being able to farm their own food. This, combined with Billy Gates buying shitloads of farm land over the world would make him lord and master of all food supplies. So what happened was that when the ship "got stuck" this second group got on board and destroyed all this stuff, which was 30 years of development and a lot of money wasted.</p>
<p>Point is our leadership is completely infiltrated at every level - unfortunately the other side did the same and wants the same outcome, just with different people in charge. If Putin is a part of this is unclear.</p>

        <p>The West screwed the pooch big after the Berlin Wall fell.</p>
<p>We had a golden opportunity for rapprochement with Russia by helping them with financial aid, modernization, trade etc. Instead the idiot Clintons and the neo-cons backed the corrupt oligarchs and drunken Yeltsin - laughing as they kicked Russia while it was down.</p>
<p>We need a fellow Christian power to stand against the Orc-empire that is China. We've pushed them away for hubris and short-term advantage. And now we will pay the price.</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin has more testosterone in his fingernail than Trudeau or Biden have in their entire bodies.</p>
<p>As for the trope about "freedom"... Really?</p>

        <p>While I agree with you, I think it's bad practice to call out individual politicians. It triggers people who are otherwise receptive and causes them to entrench. I know my first response when reading this was "Oh so you think Trump was perfect?"</p>
<p>A better message I think would be to distrust the federal government's efforts to drum up war, be it Vietnam, Iraq, or Russia/China. The real enemy is the bloated war budget and the military industrial complex.</p>

        <p>Yeah, except, if you understand the idea behind a one world government, then you quickly realize Russia will  be a burden to that plan. Russia will need to be toppled in order to bring in the NWO, thatâ€™s why we are being, very potentially, ushered into WW3 with them.</p>

        <p>That's never going to happen, I don't know when it became cool to be "Pro-Russia" their leader is a Neo-Bolshevik ex-KGB agent and a Communist at heart, they are closely aligned with China and they are on the same side, China and Russia are one in the same, they aren't taking a stand against a NWO they're fighting for control of the NWO against other proponents of it in the West, Russia wants world domination as bad as anyone else, they just want to take charge.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m not saying Iâ€™m â€˜pro-Russiaâ€™ nor am I implying it. At its essence, Russia is a very nationalistic country. They are not â€˜fighting for controlâ€™ because China was already chosen as the NWO model. From a top down perspective, wouldnâ€™t it make sense to put America and Russia at war with one another so China can make their moves if that was the case? Almost seems like thatâ€™s happening now bud.</p>
