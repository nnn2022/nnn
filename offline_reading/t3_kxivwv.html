    <strong>Well over a Million people in the United States Eat, Drink and Smoke themselves to death every year...</strong>
    <p><p>Yet, somehow it's now MY responsibility to look out for your health and put something in my body (that I won't) to help you live longer? YOU'RE Not even trying to live longer! Get out of here with that stupidity.</p></p>

        <p>Try to remember about 10-15 years ago, when gay marriage wasn’t legal in the majority of US states. There was a small but growing movement of support for the LGB (I don’t think the T and Q was a thing back then) community and equal marriage rights for them that got larger every year.</p>
<p>There was heated debate, kind of an old-school/religious versus new-school/humanist argument going on. Eventually the movement garnered enough support for a tipping point, and something very interesting happened. There was a window of time where all you had to do to be a “good person” in the eyes of the masses was say that you supported gay marriage. You didn’t have to elaborate, they didn’t need to know if you thought homosexuality was a lifestyle choice or a biological drive, you didn’t even need to actually DO anything to prove your allyship. </p>
<p>Fast forward to the 2014/15 and 2020 protests and riots over racial injustice and police murder of civilians. In 2015, the Black Lives Matter movement didn’t garner enough support to reach the tipping point, but in 2020 it did. To be a “good person” (or a “good company”) in the middle of last year, all one had to do was to allude to the statement that black lives matter. Again, easy. You didn’t have to march, you didn’t have to protest. You didn’t even really have to change your daily life, just accept a seemingly mundane (though profound in connotation) statement about a group of people who have been historically mistreated. </p>
<p>What’s happening now is that we are living through a time where the public perception is that all one has to do to be a “good person” is to wear a mask. It’s easy. Throw some shit on your face and feel smug about it. So easy in fact, that just like hashtagging BLM, or putting a rainbow sticker with the word “ally” on your lunch box, it doesn’t actually take any bravery or sacrifice at all. It’s literally just doing what people want you to do. </p>
<p>My problem with that is that people get the wrong idea that because they’re associated with the “winning” side, they’re heroic. It takes courage to be a hero, it takes risk. When you conform to the standard, you aren’t performing a heroic act at all. It’s likely that you’re just more afraid of public exclusion and a sort of modern exile (cancel culture?) than you are of anything else, and you are bending to that fear. </p>
<p>I really think what you brought up is a great argument, because it exposes the hypocrisy inherent in the reasons most people give for masks, social distancing, and lockdowns. The problem, though, is that it’s still socially acceptable to kill yourself through consumption. It’s become NOT socially acceptable to live a normal life. Nobody wants to admit to themselves that they’re acting out of fear, so they will rationalize it any way they can.</p>

        <p>Agree 150% with what you're saying, just much more then I could write out in a shot period haha.  Conditioning has been going on for a Very Long time. It's a complete highjacking of the Human Psych and deluding people with this idea of being a "good" or "heroic" person based on the majority of people's inner desire to do so. You can get majority people to do whatever you want if you convince them it's for those reasons. Even better per your example, of contributing to those BLM hashtags online, which effectively do nothing. Just participating in the social credit system online so you're not the weirdo at school/work or wherever that could potentially be a "racist" because you didn't. Social pressure is a real thing, as deceptive and disingenuous as it is.</p>

        <p>Yeah, exactly. The phrase “virtue signaling” is a perfect assessment of this behavior, but I’ve learned that if I use it people are likely to make a bunch of assumptions about my political leanings and other things about me. But that’s really what it is, signaling to the rest of the crowd “Don’t hurt me, I’m one of you”.</p>

        <p>So the people I knew who died from covid just died out of the blue in their prime? Or did they get a cough and the big scawwy government put them down? I get that you have less people in your life than there are half-life titles but could you maybe try to make sense?</p>

        <p>I truly appreciate the kindness but I want to know what you think killed these people I personally knew. I'm not talking about people in the news or hearsay but actual human beings I coexisted with before they got sick, talked to them as they reported symptoms, and then had to get the calls saying they passed away. It's one thing to claim it has a 99% survival rate which would still imply that if the whole world got it we'd have about 2x California's population dead, it's completely different to say that it hasn't killed anyone.</p>

        <p>If someone says nobody dies jumping from an airplane with a parachute is the number really 0?   You know exactly what is meant when people say nobody has died of covid.   The number isn’t 300k or whatever the “media” is claiming.   99% survival with fake death numbers.   So with real numbers that puts the statistics to basically 0.    Sure some have died but someone probably died falling out of a tree, but statically that death % is still 0.</p>

        <p>I get that your smooth brain can't put together that the reason skydiving has a statististically 0% chance of killing you is because there are rigorous safety checks, constant training, and quality equipment used... like masks, ppe, sanitization, and vaccines. Just like how in skydiving if you unbuckle yourself out of it you now have an extremely high chance of dying but it isn't 100% since some rare few have survived. So long as precautions are observed and maintained we can keep that survival rate low, meanwhile booger eaters like you are taking off your masks and ensuring others get sick.</p>

        <p>Booger eaters?   Are you 5?   No wonder you are still not seeing things.  </p>
<p>Using your odd example, I should be dead every time i leave the house since i don’t wear a mask (unbuckle myself out).   </p>
<p>I guess you missed the cnn broadcast where asymptomatic doesn’t spread??</p>
<p>I do agree people that have covid and walk around without a mask are assholes.   But mostly everyone walking around maskless are healthy individuals who laughably are looked at like zombies by the people that believe a small piece of cloth is saving their life.   </p>
<p>I’ve wasted enough time with you, especially since i’m a booger eater.   i’m also a domestic terrorist, white supremist, a granny killer, a nazi, deplorable...so i guess you coming up with booger eater makes sense since the cnn gods have called me everything else.</p>

        <p>I said booger eater because I did want to be rude but not say something harmful. You're right it's less like unbuckling your parachute and more like taking less precautions = higher risk of failure. I do think the majority are healthy, yes, but with evidence of covid causing potentially lifelong neurological and pulmonary damage I do reckon it's safer for everyone to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>My childhood friend died a year ago this month he drank himself to death. His girlfriend found his corpse on the couch after a full day already with rigormortis. 
Drinking and drugs and smoking has killed and will kill more. The reason why they allow smoking and drinking and are so laxed about it is our government wants to depopulate what better than to get tax money while depopulating. Sick fucks</p>
