    <strong>Friends trying to control me on ski trip</strong>
    <p><p>I'm going to Colorado this weekend on a long planned ski trip with a group of 10 of my 23 year old friends. My friends are so scared of covid that they are insisting on driving 18 hours each way to Colorado to avoid covid at all costs. Furthermore, they made our entire group get tested *twice* before we left for the trip, even though none of us had symptoms.. I hate long car rides and have chosen to fly to Denver and take a shuttle to our resort. Last night, I was told I needed to come to an emergency zoom call where the entire focus of the call was 1. them trying to persuade me to squeeze into the car to save everyone from exposure to covid!! 2. when I refused they said that if I take the shuttle that I will not be allowed to stay in the house we are renting, because they are not comfortable with me being in an enclosed space for 3 hours with strangers (wearing masks mind you) . 3. "WE" will not be partaking in any restaurants/bars/anything that makes these trips fun. I am now being forced to change my flight to a much more expensive option closer to the resort and doing everything according to their schedule. I feel like my free will and choice is being stripped from me and my trip is ruined before I even took off.</p>
<p>We are all perfectly healthy 23 year olds who have never gotten the virus.  I made it a point to remind them that our probability of dying/getting injured on a very long distance car trip OR while we are skiing is much higher than any of us dying or seriously getting ill from covid. Nope. None of them took my side whatsoever and basically they told me its their way or the highway. I have already paid $1500 for this trip and I'm extremely upset because this really came out of nowhere and I feel like they're treating me like a disgusting filthy murderer. I've been looking forward to this trip for so long and now I have so many bad feelings about how they are going to alienate me and treat me like some sort of biohazard for simply existing. Part of me wants to move on and accept this and enjoy the trip like I was planning to, but this entire zoom call where they pressured me and made me feel like shit about myself for over an hour has left a terrible taste in my mouth and I'm struggling to find ways to see how I will be able to be my normal friendly self. If anyone has been in a similar position or has some perspective to offer I would really appreciate it.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I got a full refund and everyone's paying me my share for the house!! If I it wasn't for you guys I would've never stood my ground, everyone was telling me to suck it up. Thanks so much for everyones support. Gonna use this money to go on another ski trip in two weeks with people who actually wanna have fun!</p></p>

        <p>Most 23 year olds nowadays are fucking pansies. Half the pansies on my rugby team in college didn’t want to get hit and we weren’t allowed to hit in practice. One guy was scared playing a shitty team cuz he had to start and didn’t want to get hit. Just play if you’re scared. Don’t leave your house but stop virtue signaling.</p>

<p>In the UK I guarantee the vast majority of people (of all ages) are only ‘complying’ because everything is shut and so it appears that way. The second things have opened up here they are full again and will be when they open again!</p>

        <p>I have friends like this. They are all super wealthy elitist kids. They are so fucking irritating.</p>
<p>I also went to hs with a popular guy who died in a skiing accident in Colorado at 21. Much more dangerous then this covid bullshit.</p>
<p>My sisters best friend has a covid scared loser who made her parents drive from the east coast cuz he was terrified of them getting it on a plane. The day they got to California he said fuck it and went to Vegas. Oh and they live together on a two year lease and she can’t leave the house.</p>

        <p>They are the exact type as these people, they think they're better and smarter than everyone and there is absolutely no room for any other opinions or mindsets. Skiing and driving on icy mountains at long distances is so much more dangerous.</p>

        <p>You have probably a 100000x chance of dying in a car accident on the icy mountains and driving for that long in the cold then you do dying of covid. Fucking pussies. I used to wake up at 5 am for lacrosse practice then work then school then rugby practice then go to bed at 10 in college when I had walking pneumonia for a few weeks from being so run down.</p>
<p>Last time I checked I’m still alive and healthy. </p>
<p>Oh and I had covid and I got rid of it in a few days by exercising outdoors and eating healthy and sleeping.</p>

I think they're treating me differently because they know that I've continued to go to the gym, travel often, and go out. Yet I've never gotten the virus and none of my other normal friends have.</p>

        <p>As a physician I can tell you they are being beyond irrational. It's like the Emporer's New Clothes.  I would imagine that at least a couple.of.them feel the same as you but are.too scared to buck the groupthink. </p>
<p>Go on the trip but insist.on a refund for the house. Don't plan on doing anything at.all with them. Go to a.different resort if possible. Hang out at some social places.. I can essentially guarantee you will find new friends that will likely blow your mind. As you look back on this, there's a strong chance you will have met a friend or two that you wouldn't have, if you stayed with the original group.</p>

        <p>Love it .. glad to see it worked out well. Consider a trip to a Florida beach where the people are mask free and you can get up close with other humans. 
(I'm in Tennessee but escape to FL whenever possible to feel the vibe of humanity without mask misery).</p>

        <p>I moved to a new city right before the pandemic so these were unfortunately the friends I made initially and got stuck with. My close friend in the group is trying to be the mediator and wants me to come, but ultimately she is trying to frame their actions towards me as being for the protection of all of us from the scary virus. When really they're just treating me different because I don't care about covid</p>

        <p>I honestly couldn't be around any of my friends if I were like this. It just shows how manipulated and weak some people are and you shouldn't have to cater to them because of their fear. Glad you got your refund, you would've had the shittiest and uncomfortable time being with them.</p>

        <p>I completely agree its sad how much this pandemic has changed people, just six months ago they were all at my birthday party and celebrating and having fun. I couldn't fathom having to pretend for a whole week that I was happy and fine with how they treated me, just to make everyone else happy. When obviously they couldn't give two fucks how I felt.</p>

        <p>It's crazy how much it has changed people, me included. I'm the guy who is pretty quiet, personable and hates confrontation, but ever since this started I've become an asshole because people treat me like one for not wearing a mask and not giving a shit about this. People are hypocritical, I've cut friends out of my life because they'll talk shit about me and then do the exact same thing. This is probably a wake up a call for you to maybe find some new friends that are like minded because its hard to call people like this your friends, under any circumstance.</p>
