    <strong>COVID has mutated so many times</strong>
    <p><p>COVID has mutated so many times, the new UK strain isn't anything special. I've been observing the early days of COVID to the present days, COVID has mutated SO MANY TIMES and has MANY STRAINS. The new UK strain isn't anything to be scared of, in fact, the more COVID mutates, the less lethal it seems to be. </p>

<p>As the vaccines go out, news are hyping up the UK strain like it's some new black death disease, it isn't.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Follow the logic:</p>
<p>A creature is designed to reproduce as much as possible evolutionary wise....</p>
<p>The COVID mutations seem to follow the pattern, the Wuhan strain was somewhat dangerous and had put many people into ventailors on my city, but as the COVID strains mutate, it seems to be less and less lethal, to the point where many people are now no-sympton cases. There. COVID's evolutionary mission succeded - reproduce as much as possible</p>
<p>It makes no sense if a virus evolves or mutates to be more lethal, because it turns out killing your host isn't an effective way to spread the virus</p></p>

        <p>Ramping up fear again serves to get more people willing to get the vaccine, so it's for the greater good. Same as when they said masks didn't work.</p>

        <p>I believe they also don't want to admit the virus is seasonal, for whatever reason. This "new highly infectious strain" is being used to explain the massive surge of cases globally. When in reality, its a seasonal flu, therefore its now peaking.</p>
<p>Then as time passes and cases drop, its "because the vaccine".</p>

        <p>Back in the early days I was pointing to the way the flu mutates and make vaccines difficult.  Retards on reddit were convinced corona was different.</p>
