    <strong>My COVID-19 Depression, &amp; How I'm Fighting It</strong>
    <p><p>Up until a few days ago, I was having a pretty rough time.</p>
<p>COVID-19 hysteria and the lockdowns haven’t been kind to me – particularly in my city (Melbourne, Australia). I’ll leave all the nitty-gritty details out of it, but needless to say, we’ve been under a pretty hardcore lockdown, and I haven’t been taking it well. People are social creatures; we don’t do well with being caged. And I definitely haven’t dealt with it very well.</p>
<p>If you knew me, you'd know I’m a huge proponent of individual freedoms, finding your own answers, and not manipulating anyone into doing what you want them to do. So being locked up and told what to do and having my freedoms stripped away – <em>and then making it illegal for us to even leave our own city</em> (there are border checkpoints around the city) – goes against every fibre of my being. I’ve essentially been having an existential-crisis.</p>
<p>Up until a few days ago, I was drinking a bottle of whiskey a day (minimum) in order to cope. Don’t worry, I’m a few days sober now – I won’t drink for the next few months at a minimum. Life lost a lot of its meaning, and my goals seemed worthless – like there was no point to anything. (The clinical definition of <em>depression</em>).</p>
<p>I’d go to start writing an article (my job is content creation), and then think, “Why? What’s the point?”<br>
I’d go onto subreddits, read other people’s problems and I'd want to reply and help them, but I'd think, “Why? What’s the point?”<br>
I’d see my girlfriend and she’d want to have sex, and I’d think, “Why? What’s the point?”<br>
I’d start watching a funny YouTube video to cheer myself up then turn it off halfway through, thinking, “Why? What’s the point?”<br>
It’d get to 2am in the morning, and know that I “should” go to bed so I don’t feel horrifically-tired the next morning… but I’d think, “Why? What’s the point?”</p>
<p>The world became a little more grey and desaturated; like the life had been drained from my very being. After all, when you’re locked up against your will, unable to travel even a few miles outside your neighbourhood/suburb… Unable to go outside without a valid reason and without wearing a mask… Unable to sit in a cafe or sit on a park bench or hang out with your friends… And then being unable to leave this madness and get away from it even if you want to, aka literally being imprisoned… <em>what’s the point of anything?</em> When you stop living, is there really any point being here?</p>

<p>It’s not all doom and gloom though. <em>I’ve been depressed before</em>; I know how to handle this. I immediately ran to my go-to manual on depression, <em>"</em><em>You Can’t Afford the Luxury of a Negative Thought</em><em>"</em>. It’s helped immensely. If you’re depressed, <em>please</em> read this book. I’ve also found solace talking to my girlfriend and two of my friends – though we’re not allowed to congregate in groups of more than 2 people (not even in each other’s homes), we do our best to communicate in whatever way we can. They’ve been my rocks.</p>
<p>I’ve also found a <em>hell</em> of a lot of comfort – and inspiration – in a book a client of mine recommended to me: <em>How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World</em>. It’s like this guy has tapped into my brain and written out all of my thoughts on freedom, on not letting other people affect you, on just getting on with your mission and working on your goals, regardless of what’s going on in life.</p>
<p><strong>I absolutely recommend grabbing this book.</strong> Doubly-so if you’re struggling with lockdowns right now. It’s a how-to manual on focusing on the things you can change and not stressing about the things you can’t. I’m only halfway through the book but I suspect by the time I finish it, I’ll be recommending it as highly as something like <em>The Slight Edge</em>.</p>
<p>The final thing that’s helped me has been <strong>giving myself a schedule.</strong> My girlfriend was the one who came up with this suggestion. I’m not normally one to have much of a schedule when it comes to my writing, instead preferring to write like crazy in bursts of creativity and passion. But a symptom of depression is feeling like your days just blend into each other; like there’s no clear finish to each day. One day blurs into the next and before you know it you’re laying on the couch staring at the wall, wondering if it’s Monday or Wednesday or if it really even matters.</p>
<p>So I set a made myself a schedule; meticiulously planned down to the exact minute. I’ve allowed myself plenty of free time in the evening, but everything until 4pm is set in stone. I’ve set alarms that go off at each stage, to keep myself on track.</p>
<p><strong>8am:</strong> Wake up. Have shower, listen to <em>positive</em> podcasts. DO NOT CHECK EMAILS (I have a bad habit of answering emails/starting work on my website before I wake up up, and it feels miserable. I need to allow myself to wake up properly first).<br>
<strong>8.30am:</strong> Spend 15 minutes planning out what I’ll do today – the tasks I want to have done.<br>
<strong>8.45am:</strong> Spend 15 minutes writing an article. Yes, it’s only 15 minutes – but as a writer my biggest issue is <em>procrastination</em>. If I can have 15 minutes of writing done before 9am, the rest of my day is <em>always</em> infinitely more productive.<br>
<strong>9am:</strong> Spend 30 minutes answering emails and responding to people on my forums (I run a self-improvement website).<br>
<strong>9.30am:</strong> Spend 1.5hrs on Reddit/forums/elsewhere, replying to people and helping them/offering advice, as well as posting some of my articles and sharing them around the net. Basically, building my brand while also trying to help people.<br>
<strong>11am:</strong> Lie on couch and write articles for an hour. (I do my best writing whilst lying on the couch).<br>
<strong>12pm:</strong> 1hr break. I usually eat food, or chill and read a book. Whatever I feel like doing.<br>
<strong>1pm:</strong> 3 more hours of writing on the couch. I allow myself as many “mini-breaks” as I want where I watch a funny YouTube video for 10 minutes, or listen to a podcast for a bit, etc. As long as writing gets done, I’m happy.<br>
<strong>4pm:</strong> Free time. (I’ve been spending this doing more writing, mostly – but I’m allowed to do whatever I want).<br>
<strong>10pm:</strong> Bedtime.</p>
<p>This schedule really has worked wonders at pulling me out of my funk and giving me something to focus on. I’ve found myself caring about my goals again, and having a purpose when I wake up. Yes, the outside world has gone batshit insane – but <em>How I Found Freedom</em> has helped with that. And this schedule has absolutely kept me on track and reminded me to focus on myself and the things <em>I</em> can do each day to make my life – and the world around me – better.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re struggling with mental health/depression due to lockdown</strong>, or even just feel frustrated by it all – try some of the things I’ve listed above. Especially the schedule – you have no idea how much sticking to a regimented timetable gives you a sense of purpose; a reason for being. It’s dumb, maybe it’s meaningless and arbitrary, maybe the times &amp; tasks you put down don’t really mean anything… but it still works. <strong>It works and that’s all that matters.</strong></p>
<p>But most importantly of all, <strong>reach out – don’t be alone.</strong> Post a comment below and tell the rest of us how you feel. If you don't want to do that, at least just know there's other people feeling the exact same way you are - <strong>you are not alone.</strong></p>
<p>And I’ll leave you with a quote from one of the best articles I’ve read all year, “<a href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-return-of-brutalism/">The Return of Brutalism</a>“:</p>
<p>“<em>There is an answer to this rampant incivility. Don’t let governments and their egregious mismanagement of this crisis wreck your integrity, your capacity for love, your belief in rights, your aspirations for yourself and others.</em> <strong><em>The only way to fight back against Brutalism is with freedom and beauty, and that begins in your own life.</em></strong>“</p>

        <p>Thank you for writing this all out. I know there are many that feel like prisoners currently I just didn’t realize that I’m some places it’s less metaphorical than others. I’ve basically been isolated since March. I have been able to maintain somewhat of a social life but I was struggling with the professional side of life before this all. I was days from leaving my job to go on an entrepreneurial path but when we got sent to WFH and I saw the signs of immediate economic problems, my plans went to hell. My job has gotten harder to deal with since WFH since staffing was cut but the company is as busy as it was before all this. I’ve wanted for a while to take a month or so off to unwind, start up a business, and then get back to life with a better mental attitude, but with the economic turmoil it’s hard to leave a decently paying job even if it makes me miserable. It’s a prison of my own making in my mind which makes it all the worse on me. Advice I’ve been getting is get out and do stuff and see people. I have in small gatherings, I just hate being out in public with the mask wearers. I hate wearing one and I hate the eyeball ostracism.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry about all the stress/uncertainty you're going through with work. I totally get the mask thing - it feels like the whole world is against you when they're all staring at you and acting like <em>you're</em> the freak. Human's aren't meant to be alone, so it's incredibly scarring to feel like everybody is judging you every second you're outside.</p>
<p>Stay strong, keep your chin up. It'll get better - I'm not sure when, but I have to hold out hope it will. If it doesn't, maybe moving is an option? I'm moving in 2 weeks from now; gonna go into a more rural town and lay low for a few weeks/months and see if things get any better in the cities.</p>

        <p>Moving is gonna be tough because I own my house and honestly idk where I would go. I’ve thought about getting more rural than the suburbia I’m currently in. I do think if Portland is any sign of things to come, getting out of the cities could be a good idea.</p>

<p>My condolences. Absolutely heinous what's been happening there. Thank you for sharing your story with us.</p>
<p>I have to agree 100% with the point made about the schedule. In recent times we've had an absolutely horrid schedule imposed upon us at work, the overall quality of life and even mental health has been on the decline since. Now I'm facing layoffs but actually looking forward to that just because I'll actually be able to build a healthy schedule finally, almost like a light at the end of the tunnel despite all of the madness going on and it being just about the worst time to lose a job.</p>
<p>"We're all in this together" except in reality, we're in this together not against any virus, but against tyranny (for lack of a better word).</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing this. I live in Melbourne also and I have been struggling with my mental health because of this lockdown. I know we are doing the right thing and things can’t be helped-we are in the middle of a pandemic. However not being able to see other people has been really hard. My boss said it well - being an extrovert isn’t necessarily being loud, it’s the way you feed energy off of others. I’ve realized how little I cope without this. </p>
<p>At a point where video calls don’t cheer me up anymore. I’ve tried your schedule idea but I just sit there feeling really blue. Even if I take a break to watch a funny video, it does little to cheer me up. Going to try out that book you recommended.</p>
