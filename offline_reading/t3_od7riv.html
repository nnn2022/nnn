    <strong>Why I became a lockdown skeptic &amp; realised misinformation from the mainstream is more damaging than misinfo from our side.</strong>
    <p><p>What really hit the nail on the head for me was when I bring up lockdown collateral damage - the suicides, the domestic abuse, the deteriorating mental health and the profound negative effect on the young. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/19/lockdown-may-cost-200k-lives-government-report-shows/">The UK governments own study concluded up to 200k people could die as a direct result to the first lockdown.</a> We since had 2 more after the publishing of that data.</p>
<p>Pro-lockdowners simply wave this off like it doesn't matter or they're blinded by their middle class bubbles and think this isn't happening. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o98q33/daily_discussion_june_28_2021_gmt0/h3bl6r3/">"You really think lockdowns are worse than COVID!?"</a> Somebody said this to me 5 days ago. I began to question their stance, do they really care about society or do they only care about themselves and/or their image? It seems to me that they're self-righteous virtue signallers, hero's to society in their mind. This is probably the result of Marvel pumping out non-stop low brow superhero movies. I jest, sorry Marvel fans.</p>
<p>All the while I've been told I am a monster for not wanting people locked inside their homes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/briefing/outdoor-covid-transmission-cdc-number.html">due to a virus that almost exclusively spreads indoors.</a> How many died because university students were sent home to their multi-generational households? We will never know and nobody will be held accountable.</p>
<p>&rt;These recommendations would be more grounded in science if anywhere close to 10 percent of Covid transmission were occurring outdoors. But it is not. There is not a single documented Covid infection anywhere in the world from casual outdoor interactions, such as walking past someone on a street or eating at a nearby table.</p>
<p>This kind of illogical thinking made me realise how powerful misinformation is when published by a mainstream source such as Governments, celebrities &amp; journalists. When people discuss misinformation they are mostly talking about whacky websites that brought us "Covid is caused by 5G!" but what damage has that done to society? I think the answer is negligible.</p>
<p>Here's an anecdotal example, I was in a coffee shop today and a mother scolded her young child for touching a counter top, "remember the virus!" She screeched. How is this anything but abuse? Kids should be free to engage with their environment, <a href="https://www.educationalplaycare.com/blog/sensory-play-important-development/#:~:text=Sensory%20play%20includes%20any%20activity,%2C%20balance%2C%20sight%20and%20hearing.&amp;text=As%20the%20child%20develops%20trust,to%20engage%20with%20this%20food.">sensory play</a> has been proven to be beneficial to children's mental growth. We know the virus spreads primarily by aerosols and all the disinfecting we were doing did <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4">nothing to "stop the spread"</a> but the mainstream talking points have not kept up with the science, millions of children around the world now have to live in fear of something that has almost no statistical chance of harming them, and the precautions that are being programmed into them are a waste of energy.</p>
<p>I would love for people to elaborate on this, please comment below with other examples of MSM misinformation causing damage to society, I want to collate as much as possible.</p></p>

        <p>Good post.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the people you mentioned in the middle-class bubbles are not used to being exposed to risk. For some of them covid will be the first time they've ever felt that their security, or the security of their friends and family, has been seriously threatened. So they're very angry and take it very personally if you don't seem to "understand" that covid is literally the worst thing ever and about a trillion times worse than all the consequences of all the measures put in place to combat it.</p>
<p>So if millions of people lose their livelihoods, if people face eviction from their homes, if cancer patients don't get diagnoses or treatments in time, if little kids grow up in a stunted, restricted environment that damages their development, if families living in tiny cramped flats with no access to gardens experience intolerable tensions, if women get beaten up in their homes, if children get abused, if people living alone become depressed and isolated, if people struggle with mental health to the point of suicide, if young folk miss out on important life events, if women lose the best years of their fertility, if deaf people struggle because they can't lip-read when others wear masks, if people requiring social care and support are abandoned and their home visits cancelled, if people in care homes and hospitals die alone, if the bereaved missed the chance to comfort their dying loved-ones, if a child is buried without his parents being allowed to attend the funeral (this really happened in 2020), if people are permanently disabled or killed by "rare" vaccine side-effects, if civil liberties are eroded, if a de facto medical appartheid is implemented which classifies and divides people by their vaccine status, if the unvaccinated lose rights and liberties, freedom of movement, freedom of speech and freedom of thought, if we are sleep-walking into totalitarianism... well none of these things is as scary or as consequential as covid is, <em>so there</em>!</p>
<p>The most ardent supporters of lockdowns, masks and vaccines are often relatively privileged people. If they're not personally at much risk of any of the things on the list above then the risk of contagion is unsurprisingly the one thing they focus on. Covid is unpredictable and uncontrollable. Literally it's in the wind, beyond the arsenal of protections and mitigations and insurances that privelege could afford them in more normal times.</p>
<p>I'm not one of the people who thinks covid is trivial. I think it can be very dangerous to vulnerable people, and lots of people in our country are vulnerable, for a whole variety of reasons. But millions of people are also vulnerable to the consequences I've listed above, and those are just the ones I could think of off the top of my head.</p>
<p>The media and virtue-signallers on social media tell us it's selfish not to take the vaccines,or to protest lockdowns, or to worry about loss of civil liberties that could outlast the virus. But <em>of course</em> it's not selfish to be concerned about the serious social and personal consequences on the list above. Whether your biggest fear is for yourself or for others over any of these things, it is surely valid. And sadly, lots of human beings are all too used to facing significant, imminent threats to ther well-being, chronic insecurity, and daily dealings with recurrent, unsurmountable difficulties. But the covid virtue-signallers focus on covid above all else because covid is literally the biggest existential threat they can imagine. I get the impression that some of them have a feeling they can barely articulate (and social sense probably tells them it's better not to try) that covid is just <em>very unfair</em> to them <em>personally</em> somehow.</p>
<p>Remember Madonna sitting in her rose-petal bathtub at the start of the pandemic saying "the terrible thing about this virus is it doesn't discriminate"? Of course it discriminates! Madonna is far less at risk of covid than a bus-driver, a healthcare worker, or someone living in cramped, crowded accomodation on the 10th floor of a tower block who has to share a poorly ventilated lift that's been used as a toilet too many times for the smell of urine to ever fully dissipate. But that's not the view from the rose petalled bathtub, is it?</p>
<p>I think for those used to systems of social distinction that generally work in their favour, covid must seem scarily indiscriminate. That's why they're so hung up on it being a threat to us all, and on <em>everyone</em> having to get vaccinated. Public sanitation was brought to Britain when the rich discovered that they too could catch cholera. They discovered the collective good when  suddenly they faced a collective threat.</p>
<p>It is disingenuous to try to make a moral high ground out of insisting on collective sacrfice to rid the world of the menace that looks most likely to burst your own personal bubble of safety and security. To virtue-signal that any cost is worth paying to combat covid when you are not likely to be the one handed the bill.</p>
<p>The bill is already enormous. The virtuous covid faithful won't even let us talk about the people who are paying it. Twitter will slap a warning on a tweet by a father about his child who has a feeding tube snce she got her covid vaccine. Twitter says it's "misleading", dangerous misinfomation. A father talking about what happened to his kid.</p>

        <p>in the vaxx trials, if participates had an adverse reaction, they could be unblinded in order to get a diagnosis of what their condition was. If they were unblinded, then their data, including the adverse reaction, would not be included in the trial results, thus making it look like no, or only mild adverse events occurred.</p>
