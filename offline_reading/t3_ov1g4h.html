    <strong>With everything that's happening, does anyone else not want to be on this planet any longer?</strong>
    <p><p>Do not mistake this as some suicidal tendency post. It's got zero to do with self harm or death.</p>
<p>The way I see it is that things are probably only going to get worse. People I never took for "conspiracy" types are spooked. What spooks them the most is that they have woken up and others have fallen deeper into their sleep. They feel that something is coming and can feel it inside. I sat at a bar tonight with a friend of mine and we looked around the place at the people eating. I said</p>
<p>"Can you believe that people really think that everything the media has said about covid is true? Like, that they actually think that if we get these boosters shots or whatever that life will go back to normal and it was really all about a virus? Isn't it amazing that they have no idea what's coming and are totally clueless of the bigger picture?". It's legitimately two different realities. </p>
<p>You know how they say you should never worry about something like the SP500 falling to 0 because at that rate you'd have much bigger problems than your stock portfolio? That's how I view this. If we get to a point of death / incarceration vs. forced vaccinations... is it really a world I want to live in? REALLY?</p>
<p>Point is - My hope for the future has essentially vanished. Even if things turn around and they don't manage to get make it into some doomsday scenario, the world is still going to shit and fast. This is going to turn into a horribly trying time and honestly I see nothing to fight for.</p>
<p>It's the truth. I just don't care anymore.</p></p>

        <p>Amen. History has always been filled with struggle. There are so many who gave so much that came before us; now it's our turn. The establishment wants you to feel powerless, alone, and scared. However, they NEED you to feel that way because their power is derived from US. </p>
<p>You are not alone. You are not powerless. Take the beauty in every day and do not bow to these cowards. Keep your head held and simple say no. Many others simply need some else to say it first.</p>

        <p>I can’t imagine “death or forced vaccinations” ever being the case. The most extreme would be “prison or forced vaccination”.  </p>
<p>The only reason people support the vaccine is because they believe they are doing the right thing to save lives. That goes away in a “death or vaccine” scenario</p>

        <p>Yup, 100%. I could have written this myself. I think some people haven't woken up because they are genuinely too busy in their lives to pay much attention - for them COVID rules are just another thing we have to do like paying taxes or following traffic laws. My brother &amp; SIL are two of the smartest people I know, but they have a 16 month old and both work full time. I was telling them about the Great Reset and "medi-hotels" in Australia and all this stuff and they were like, we haven't watched the news in months we have no idea what you're talking about. The information is only scary if they SEE the information. They will keep getting their shots, etc. because they don't want their life to be any harder than it already is. </p>
<p>But yeah, I'm with you on not wanting to live in a worst case scenario world. I have no survival skills. I am somewhat interested in living off grid, but then I'd be so far away from all my friends and family, and I can barely work a power drill, so I don't know. That seems like a lonely and fruitless path.</p>

        <p>It’s weird because I’m the same, but opposite side.</p>
<p>2020 fucking sucked. Aside from some celebrities and billionaires, I think we can all agree there. </p>
<p>But this year really opened my eyes to the bitterness in people. Those willing to look out for their fellow man and those telling their fellow man to look out for himself. I personally don’t understand the mentality, especially since we’ve done this same song and dance back in the 1920s. Anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers were around then too. Funny how history repeats itself.</p>
<p>Do I really want to live in a world where people who have access to medicine refuse it because of government conspiracies rather than personal preferences? Where people get screamed at on the both side for wearing/not wearing a mask? Call me a hippie, but if we all cared about each other as much as we care about ourselves than this world would be worth sticking around for.</p>
<p>I can’t say that things would be different had we (like, the entire world) all agreed on following the mandates, quarantines, etc. but that would have only been possible in an ideal world in anyway so what’s the point. </p>
<p>One where people didn’t need to worry about their next rent payment because they had to quarantine for 2 weeks. Having food to feed their families, access to essentials, etc.</p>
<p>The pandemic and the events relating to it wasn’t what made me want to not be on this planet, the realization it brought about that the way our world is set up and works did.</p>

        <p>You propose people sacrifice freedoms for personal safety, but individual liberty is more valuable than that. </p>
<p>Believing this does not mean that somebody doesn’t care about you or that they don’t care about human life, it means that there are values that are more important than any individual. These values go beyond our current situation and should be preserved. It’s not a personal thing. It’s about preserving values. These are the ideals that make the future hopeful. </p>
<p>Maybe if this pandemic was something truly horrific, like ebola or smallpox, than maybe there would be an argument for more drastic measures, maybe. But there’s no way that this current pandemic justifies anything like what we’re seeing.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying people should do it. In fact, my point was I’m upset that it mainly got this bad because of how we can literally not afford to not work without family lives crumbling/people losing homes.</p>
<p>That was the part that makes me extremely sad to think about.</p>
<p>Whatever freedom argument you got there is nice and all; I could literally care less if you’re vaccinated or not, if you wear a mask or not because that’s not what makes me sad. I’m sad that there was no point where people who had power could have done more to help things from going to ridiculous extremes to the point that this is still a fight people are “needing” to have.</p>
<p>Exact same thing happened back then. Instead of helping people, the wealthy and government let people fight about it until it eventually “worked itself out”.</p>
<p>But now we’ve had several H1N1 vaccines and I’m sure we’ll have several more COVID/SARs vaccines too so I don’t think that part of the anti-vax “all these vaccines” argument holds much point. </p>
<p>But the fact that we live in a world where if someone did get sick, they literally couldn’t do anything about it because they can’t afford to is what makes me sad. You know it happens in the world, but to hear news after news of it happening just let’s it really set in.</p>

<p>The people in power have been actively encouraging people to take this to the extremes. They have been encouraging us to fight each other over this. I don't want to fight anyone. I want the government to stop telling me who I should hate.</p>
<p>Yes, the world has become a sad place.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I said basically this. I know the wealthy and the government want us to fight rather than do anything.</p>
