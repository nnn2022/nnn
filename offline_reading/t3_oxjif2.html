        <p>No one is shaming anyone to eat that garbage food. No one is threatening anyone to eat that garbage food. The comparison is not even close. 
Remember that all this covid garbage is from a faulty test that can’t even tell you if you have the illness with any accuracy. 
For the record I buy 90% of my food from local small farms. I never get sick anymore. The other 10% is mtn dew and yes I know that is poison BUT it’s my choice.</p>

        <p>I am not the person you asked, but it was possible (at least five years ago or so) for me to feed a family of six for $600 a month. I did that for quite some time. I haven't kept track recently as we have been blessed with an increase in income.</p>

        <p>My mtn dew costs me about $1.50 a day. I wait until it’s on sale and buy $200 at a time so it saves me money. 
As for groceries it costs about $200 a month for vegetables, meat i buy a years supply at a time ground beef, steak and a mix of pork last cost me $1000, milk straight from the cow is $6 a half gallon but don’t use that often. I get eggs chicken, duck and turkey for average $3 a dozen. Fresh bread is 8$ a loaf but no stomach issues from it. So my bill not counting soda is around 100$ a week. We also package all the meat in portion sizes so no left overs.

I have made friends with all the people that I buy my stuff from and it is a little cheaper.</p>

        <p>The powers that be are.</p>
<p>I don't "trust" the FDA.  I cannot realistically avoid every sketchy thing in existence.  I can refuse a novel vaccine that uses technology that went from never before being available on the market to heavily pushed on the entire population in a span of a few months.</p>
<p>OWS or some equivalent would have occurred under any administration. People think conservatives who don't want the vaccine have some sort of 'dissonance' when it comes to Trump and OWS.  We don't.  We just don't personally want the vaccine.  This really isn't a difficult concept.</p>
<p>I was always under the impression that a vaccine would be available as an <em>option</em> to those at-risk and those who wanted it, which is generally fine. People are at liberty to make their own assessments. What I don't like is the suppression of effective treatments in order to justify EUA or, in a broader context, the suppression of anything that challenges the 'status-quo', which history has consistently shown to be the antithesis of 'science' and truth, both of which are inherently multi-faceted.</p>

        <p>The immortal cell lines used to produce the mRNA are the same ones used to produce transgenic vectors for the food.<br>
You can’t just put DNA into a nucleus, they use modified infection tools from pathogens.<br>
You know they keep saying the vaccines didn’t just get invented suddenly?? 😶</p>

        <p>I understand that his technology isn't "new", as the concept is similar to GMO foods. I'd like to support my argument with the following document as my source <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/135276/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/135276/download</a></p>
<p>It shows a timeline of when GMO methods were studied and brought available to the public.</p>
<p>1986: "The federal government establishes the Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology. This policy describes how FDA, USDA, and EPA work together to regulate the safety of GMOs."</p>
<p>1994: "The first GMO produce created through genetic engineering a GMO tomato becomes available for sale after studies evaluated by federal agencies proved it to be as safe as traditionally bred tomatoes."</p>
<p>2003: "The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations develop international guidelines and standards to determine the safety of GMO foods."</p>
<p>2005: "GMO alfalfa and sugar beets are available for sale in the U.S."</p>
<p>2015: "FDA approves an application for the first genetic modification in an animal for use as food, a geneticallyengineered salmon."</p>
<p>2016: "Congress passes a law requiring labeling for some foods produced through genetic engineering and uses the term “bioengineered,” which will start to appear on some foods."</p>
<p>2017: "GMO apples are available for sale in the U.S."</p>
<p>2019: "FDA completes consultation on first food from a genome edited plant."</p>
<p>As you can see, the amount of time that passed between researching safety and creating guidelines is more than two decades long. This is a considerable amount of time compared to the COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 was unleashed in December 2019. We are now in August 2021 and the US government is edging closer and closer to mandating it nationwide. There has not been considerable research done on the long-term side effects of this permanent gene-altering vaccine in humans. People were never coerced/pressured into buying GMO foods, but they are being coerced/pressured into getting injected. Food for thought...</p>

        <p>Why would they pressure/coerce when they could just put it in your food and have you eat it without your knowledge. Where on that timeline did you make the choice not to eat GMO’s??</p>
<p>And don’t you find it odd that something is considered “not significantly different” when it comes to being placed on the GRAS list but is considered “significantly different” when it comes to patent laws?</p>
<p>Edit: it was new back then… food for thought</p>
<p>Edit2: oh and you’re trusting the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines">FDA</a> now?</p>

        <p>No one was forcing me to eat GMO food or restrict my breathing if I don’t. Or restrict travel if I don’t. Or force sticks up my nose every week if I don’t.</p>
<p>I’ve also been a big critic of transgenic modification and potential issues with it since the early 2000s.</p>

        <p>Yea it was.</p>
<p>That’s the beauty though, having a choice. Not having to be forced.</p>
<p>Especially not adults forcing things on other adults, what parents do with their own kids is their business within reason.</p>
