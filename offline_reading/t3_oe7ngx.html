    <strong>An interesting knock-on effect amplifying the Reddit echo-chamber</strong>
    <p><p>I'm banned from commenting on posts in /r/news, as I suspect many of you are, too. I don't remember why I got banned, but it was Covid-related, and more than likely was because I didn't think it was that big of a deal and commented something to that effect. </p>
<p>It's not a big deal. It's just Reddit, nothing important... but every once in a while, you see a news story that is right in your wheelhouse and you can't participate because you weren't afraid of catching a cold last year. </p>
<p>As a successful investor and a business owner with over a dozen employees, I have valuable information for people in the social security thread, but I'm relegated to scrolling through misinformation and angst because I can't contribute. </p>
<p>I suspect a lot of subs are going to become even more of an echo chamber than they already are as reddit wields the ban hammer for any opinions deemed dangerous or wrong.</p></p>

        <p>Just do not use it.</p>
<p>There are so many alternatives that would love to take the users.</p>
<p>I just come to reddit to laugh at the sheeple. Everybody knows that reddit is an echo chamber full of misinformation, so the people who believe it are responsible for themselves, i do not feel bad for them if this misinformation ends up harming them. It was their choice. No need to save the sheeple.</p>

        <p>It's always been like that. If you're an investor or business owner people automatically assume we all made that money by not paying min wage or that we freeload of the back of everyone else even though we're taking a lot more risk and probably pay more taxes in a month than some of them did in their last 5 years.</p>
<p>Moral of the story is that misery likes company. You have someone in that actually understands the system saying what's objectively wrong with it and everyone losses their minds.</p>
