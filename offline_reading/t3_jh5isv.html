    <strong>How far are our governments willing to go? Would they shoot protesters if the protests became big enough? Invade non mask and non restriction countries?</strong>
    <p><p>I have no idea, we hasn't seen how the west react to protests like the Maidan protest in Ukraine were people camped for months having fierce fights with the cops right in front of the parlement. What will happen? Will they shoot us?</p>
<p>What will happen if such a country we people win and change the government, open up, protect these at risk and then spreads the truth around on social media etc</p>
<p>Makes a task force to investigate into China (Was the people falling on the streets fake?)<br>
Makes a task force to investigate neighbouring countries of breaching human rights</p>
<p>What would the neighbouring countries do? Censorship? Invade?</p>
<p>We're sadly in such a bad situation the only free places are Sweden, Florida and a few other US sates.<br>
Rest of the "free" world is under siege and I don't think we can get the truth from any non western country sadly yet.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;Would they shoot protestors if the protests became big enough?</p>
<p>I would LIKE to say no, but considering how many governments in the "free" world seem to want to be the CCP so damned badly, I'm forced to assume that they would love to respond to mass demonstrations against their authority like the CCP too.</p>
<p>Now what would be REALLY interesting is if the likes of tyrants like Cuomo, Newsom, Whitmer or Jabba Pritzker decided tried to call up the National Guard for an American reenactment of Tienanmen Square in the name of "protecting public health." I could see that becoming ugly fast.</p>

        <p>Any protest should start by kidnapping or/and killing politians and known billionaires and so called world leaders. Truth is, and i know most will disagree, i believe we should go back to cave. Comfort and safety are overrated. Shouting and throwing stones at police solves nothing</p>
