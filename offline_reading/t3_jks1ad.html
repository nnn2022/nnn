    <strong>At this point it's a war on information</strong>
    <p><p>We know the truth. From the start we all knew something was off. It's up to us from here on to plant seeds and spread as much information as we can and things might get pretty heavy over the next few months with winter starting. Everything is getting censored "for our protection" , even reddit, but, we CAN and WILL still make a change through unity, compassion, and educating our fellow man. There's been way too much shit thats come out and doesn't add up with this entire thing from the start you'd have to be a fool to just buy into all of it.</p>
<p>Things might start getting rough with winter starting. Everyone's already so paranoid that when they get your average cold symptoms that come around this time of the year they'll freak out and go get tested. Add that ontop of all the false positive and bullshit testing going on the "cases" are going to keep rising (like the media's been pushing every fucking day since day 1). </p>
<p>I swear to God every person I know AND stranger that I have talked to since this whole thing started has said the same thing, they don't know anyone that got covid or if they did, it was very minor symptoms like a cold. Does this really feel like a pandemic to you? </p>
<p>Remember when this first started and there were videos of people laying dead in the streets? Where is that now?</p>
<p>Remember when multiple news outlets were caught reusing hospital footage from other countries AND you could clearly see test dummied in rooms with "covid patients"?</p>
<p>Remember when there was a "#filmyourhospital" hashtag and ig page on instagram trending that got deleted and censored? (Consisted of people going to their reportedly "overflowing" hospitals only to find them dead empty)</p>
<p>Keep planting these seeds and whatever else you hear in people's heads before our lives are changed for the worse. Dr Fauci just said that "Life might not return to normal until 2022". Over my fucking dead body. </p>
<p>Your everyday person is clinging to a false reality and struggling to accept the idea that maybe there IS an agenda against them and they ARE being lied to on a global scale. The future is in our hands as the people. Spread information and compassion and stop complying to this bullshit. Unplug your fellow brothers and sisters from the matrix.</p>
<p>I don't give a damn anymore bro, I'm fed the fuck up. Tired of all this bullshit hate, division and misinformation nowadays. I'm standing up and pushing back against this tyranny and Im done complying. Join me. We're in it together</p></p>
