    <strong>(ANALYSIS) My large take on all of this being 17 years old in America.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a young senior in high school living in America, in brink of all of this, and I just really wanted to share my insight and thoughts into this whole well... everything going on in the world. I wasn't skeptical about COVID-19 at first when it started in January. I thought it was something huge but didn't seem like there was anything odd going on. I thought at the time that lockdowns and masks were normal. </p>
<p>Until I began to "wake up" as they call it. </p>
<p>I really began to question why we needed lockdowns and masks for a virus with a really high survival rate. If had 99% chance with any girl at high school, I'd be a happy person. Anyways, I then looked into what The Great Reset was. I saw that most if not all governments, corporations, and financial institutions around the world were onto it, that this was the beginning of a new normal, a dystopian unkind future that people before were calling the "New World Order" but now it's literally happening. </p>
<p>Being young as hell and knowing this and for no-one else to?</p>
<p>Can REALLY make you feel alone.</p>
<p>I put two-and-two together and came to the confusion that in order to bring in a new reset of the world, you must literally destroy the old ones, and with the lockdowns, riots, and all of that, it makes sense. Bringing order out of chaos is what they're doing. With the looming economic crash, this is looking more likely. I can see with the BLM riots, they're trying to reset them in order to usher in a new system of policing to name on example. It wasn't about race like many think it is. Another more humane example compared to the rest would be virtual learning. This will become the new normal as snow days are no longer going to be viable with virtual learning, making things easier for them. No snow days means less time will be lost. </p>
<p>In conclusion, I came to realize that our governments have no control, or that the people they did so who opposed them within the government had no chance to gaining any power within the system, like President Trump, and installing 'Build Back Better' Biden who in case you didn't know, is the slogan used by the WEF and by other leaders like Boris Johnson and New Zealand's new PM. Our governments are simply run by insane people with insane intentions who think they can reset the world. They want control. They're pulling strings and people are falling to it. People are taking one piece of the puzzle and not taking the others to see the much bigger and deeper picture. </p>
<p>Other conclusions made me realize that movements like BLM are there to literally reset and cause further chaos, rather than be a champion for race, in order to bring in this new normal. This can be hard as many of my generation openly back this and they're duped into doing so not knowing what is about to happen. But, being seventeen, most people my age don't know this stuff. They're stuck on social media fighting over race, gender, rights, which are all good things to support, don't get me wrong, but the movements themselves are being used. I used to do that as well and it's easy to do so. </p>
<p>However, I'm not that person anymore, and they don't understand that they're all being sort of... duped. Many of them are talking about how lockdowns are good and masks are good and here I know that masks are simply a precedent to whatever they might force on us on the future and that lockdowns are absolutely horrible in every way, shape, or form. </p>
<p>I'm like every teenager who likes teenager things but to know all of this information, especially if there's no-one else I feel as though does besides my family, can be lonesome. Like, how am I to date a girl and this to be my belief system? I'm not sure how can I explain this to anyone I date in the future. If I told them that our world is being reset by a bunch of wealthy billionaires over how they want the world to run, maybe they'd think I'm batshit high. </p>
<p>It sucks because you can't relate to anyone anymore. You see things way more different than they do and even then it's hard to convince them otherwise. </p>
<p>And I'm not claiming to be some genius knowing this information from a young age either. I'm not even close to being genius at stuff if I were to say. I don't like being that braggy type. I just really want other people to truly consider seeing the world in a different light even if it takes a while too and to help them so that they're aware, but that's hard. </p>
<p>So yeah. That's my two cents. There's a lot more I can talk about but it's getting too long. I could go on for hours but I'm wondering what you all think about it as well. </p>
<p>My generation are literally on the vanguard of what is coming as well.</p></p>

        <p>I’m 16 and there’s a lot more on your side than you think. A lot of kids our age are just afraid to show their beliefs because whenever you go on social media they’re shaming and blaming people for not wearing masks. Threatening them with death, downvoting their comments and getting their posts banned; essentially hiding these ideas from others that might’ve agreed. Talk with a few friends privately and they’ll tell you.</p>
<p>And in regards to the girlfriend thing, expressing your opinions shouldn’t matter too much. If she loves you, then your position on this one subject shouldn’t be an immediate deal-breaker. Crazy that we even have to talk about hypotheticals, this is the age when we regularly would’ve been in relationships if it wasn’t for lockdowns.</p>
<p>Speaking about the movements, I also agree. This year has created a lot of division between people.</p>
<p>Most the people in my classes discussed that these restrictions and mandates are bullshit, but they’re worried that someone is going to harass/fight them if they take their masks off. And our generation doesn’t have a lot of fighters, if i’m honest.</p>
<p>Social media makes the harassment look like an everyday thing, but it’s usually scripted and doomers never have the balls to approach an anti-masker in person. They’ll take creepshots of them and make unfunny memes about them, but they’ll never risk the chance of getting their scrawny asses beat, stabbed or shot.</p>
<p>I for one have already lost so much because of this lockdown to the point where I don’t give a fuck what happens to me anymore. Why would I be afraid of dying to a virus or an angry doomer in a dystopian world where everything is shut down and there is nothing worth living for anymore? I preferred quality of life over quantity of life, but they’re taking all of the quality away and I barely even got my chance to experience it. </p>
<p>My dad made the remark to a doomer during this lockdown ‘Why would you be so obsessed with living when you have nothing to live for?’ and it stuck with me. They’re so afraid of death that they’ve stopped living.</p>
<p>I’m afraid for our future if people don’t start waking up. I don’t want to have kids in a clown world like this.</p>

        <p>You know why those kids do not show their beliefs? Because they know that sharing beliefs that say: "Uhh, i had a very small inconvenience with masks this morning so hundreds of thousands of people dying is not as important." Are complete and utter lunacy. The people you and your family call "Doomers" are what i call "people that want this virus to finally be over instead of possibly infecting and killing living, breathing humans." Have you been in 1344? Where people died left, right and center? They also could'nt do shit. Was it their fault for the abomination of a plague that happened? Eh, i should not be asking you this, you would not be on this sub-or subs like r/conservative, for that matter- if you had even a smurf's dick worth of empathy. The fact that you seem to have no scrupules about stabbing or shooting someone shows that. You should read some George Orwell, because then you will see what a dystopian world truly is. The reason you are so willing to go and shoot someone because of your different ideals shows what an EARTHSHAKING mistake your so-called Founding Fathers made when they allowed morons like you to carry a weapon made for murder. Oh, by the way, what the hecc do you mean with: "I prefer quality of life over quantity of life" Like, are you okay with about 3 percent of the worlds population living a happy life because they are immune to the virus, but do not like people having two years of lockdown and THEN being happy? You also seem like you are trying to fake being depressed, which i think is an insult to people that are ACTUALLY depressed and/or suffering from a mental health condition.
tl:dr: You have no empathy or sympathy, not even an amoeba's dick worth. You are too Murican.</p>

        <p>I'm 18 soon to be 19 and I woke up at 16, being totally against vaccines after seeing what happened and learning the truth that happened. </p>
<p>I'll do what I can to spread this message, as much and as far. I get it when you say that you'll feel lonely. I feel incredibly lonely too, but I feel and I know that it is the truth. </p>
<p>Have faith, and keep connecting and learning the truth. And have faith that not everyone is totally hardcore or brainwashed, that they can be reasoned with. </p>
<p>I have a friend that is so far down the rabbit hole, that he doesn't think. And so far has tried to make me think that I have gone down some conspiracy rabbit hole instead. Although the moment I find that it's a conspiracy, I will instead choose to find out what it is. </p>
<p>Conspiracy is a label to keep most of them away, but for me, it means that they are onto something. </p>
<p>But keep searching, and keep talking about it. That's the most important thing for me, now that I'm here and have found my corner to keep spreading the word.</p>

        <p>Hey. I really appreciate it. I'm doing my share of continuing to be informed and informing people as best and maturely as I can. I've been struggling with coping because simply put it seems as though no friends and some family seem to get it. I'm lucky to have my immediate family woke as well. It honestly is lonely. But I know we're not the only people. I wish just there was more people and in that we can always benefit. But I'm glad to see that there's more people my age who understand.</p>

        <p>Yeah, although for me, I don't have that luxury of family. I have gotten into worse arguments with them, and by this point, the effort to just keep on fighting isn't worth it. So I decided to just focus my attention on just trying to get them to see it and spreading the truth to those who already want to wake up. </p>
<p>But this community has been my rock, as much as the Highwire was in terms of being that sane source that kept me grounded and stopped me from believing that I was insane even though they never really went down the NWO until recently. But either way, I have faith so long as I keep on trying.</p>

        <p>Fair warning, this subreddit and others like it are cancerous and will gradually radicalize you.  Everyone can find an echo chamber, right or wrong.  Think about that.  If you genuinely feel like you’re drifting away from your peers that’s something you can’t ignore.  There’s nothing wrong with being grounded in reality, and often friends and family are great anchors.  Also, 3% may not seem like a lot of casualties, but this is the first time we’ve gone against this virus, and no one actually knows how bad, or good, things will go.  What if there are horrible, long term side effects?  What if it takes out 3% of the infected every year? Despite what anyone says on this circle-jerk subreddit, we just don’t have enough information to be sure about how this will end.   “Feeling” like the lockdowns are an overreaction is completely valid - it’s frustrating for everyone! But we simply can’t jump to conclusions until this all blows over and we can see the full picture.  Hang in there dude.</p>
