    <strong>Long COVID - Overdiagnosed?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been thinking that "long covid", although I believe it's real, is overdiagnosed. The media claims that 10-30% of people who get COVID have long term symptoms but I doubt it's really THAT prevalent. If it is really that common, wouldn't we be hearing reports of disability/welfare systems being overwhelmed? I remember some were predicting that earlier this year. There are countries with similar and even higher infection rates compared to the US. Also, wouldn't there be labor shortages in some industries (particularly ones which involve physically demanding work and ability to taste/smell)?</p>
<p>Also, months ago, there have been numerous reports of leaders and celebrities getting COVID-19 but after the initial news reports, very few had updates reported in the news. They also say "asymptomatic cases" can result in long covid. I have a hard time believing that is common. I've seen a few stories about long haulers not being diagnosed back in March 2020, but wouldn't we be seeing more of those as well now?</p>
<p>In addition, with some long haulers supposedly feeling better after getting the vaccines, I'm thinking in at least some of those cases, long covid was really anxiety or a nocebo/placebo effect.</p>
<p>Long covid is quite broad and includes symptoms which are not unique to "long covid". Other viral illnesses can cause some long covid symptoms such as fatigue as well. I know several people who got COVID, and 2 were long-haulers. Both were hospitalized. They are basically back to normal now. One case was a long hospitalization and for the other, he was able to do 5 mile runs around 6 months post hospitalization.</p>
<p>Finally, it seems that some think that long covid = permanent damage but that's not true. My 2 cents.</p></p>

        <p>Long Covid is nothing more than people damaged by the panic treatments to this overblown flu.</p>
<p>People that are intentionally put into medical comas and have their lungs crushed by ventilators for over a month, pumped with antibiotics, steroids and immunosupresants, while being fed nothing but glucose through a tube have a long path to recovery? You don't say.</p>

        <p>This, and add in the people who haven’t been able to get regular medical care for their conditions during the pandemic. Depending on their condition, not getting treated is damaging them to the point that they’re facing hospital time and serious ailments where they would’ve been mostly okay with continued treatment. It wouldn’t surprise me to find out a lot of them comprise “long haulers”.</p>

        <p>That’s been peddled in the MSM. It makes no sense to me. I’m wondering if most of those who claim to have long COVID/organ damage after an asymptomatic or very mild infection are just blaming anything new on COVID. It’s almost like dying with COVID vs dying of COVID in a way. Basically, it’s like correlation vs causation.</p>

        <p>I believe I fall into this category. I had covid last year and it was really bad. I'm a young healthy man with no comorbidities or illness. One of my problems with covid was my joints ached badly, like indescribably bad. When my body recovered from covid, which took a month, my joints still were sore and they still are to this day, a year later. </p>
<p>I think "long covid" not only is a stupid name but it's just dumb in general. I believe this man made weapon smashes through your body like Miley Cyrus on a wrecking ball and leaves you worse off then how it found you. </p>
<p>So I don't believe they are symptoms, I think it's just the result. When a tornado blows your house down you don't say that you have <em>"long tornado"</em> because the tornado is gone, it's over. You're just left with the damage. As for over diagnosed? Who knows? Maybe the point of this virus was to fuck everyone up just enough to barely function so we are more willing to accept our government saviours.</p>

        <p>Yes, psychosomatic to a high degree!</p>
<p>If you convince yourself that you are sick, you <em>will</em> eventually experience all kinds of obscure symptoms. I'm not saying that this is the case for everyone, some people get ME/CFS from normal viruses that penetrate the body's defenses. So I imagine it's the same for some ppl who recovered from covid, but most cases are probably psychosomatic and brought on by fear and worry as a result of all the fear mongering propaganda.</p>
