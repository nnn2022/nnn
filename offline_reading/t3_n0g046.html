    <strong>My experience with Covid and Moderna (THIS IS NOT TO PROMOTE VACCINES)</strong>
    <p><p>I was one of the ones who got the Moderna vaccine. However, I should state this wasn't from free will. I live in a household were some members are "higher risk". Yes I am obese, but that didn't factor into getting the shot. In fact I am obese and had Covid myself. All what I experienced from it was some sniffling and just not feeling good. Didn't have a fever, breathing wasn't fine but that was from getting stuffed up (stuffy nose), I also didn't lose my sense of taste just the smell.</p>
<p>After dealing with that I tested Negative after a couple of weeks later. I didn't even know I had it until a couple of folks in my household got it and tested positive. They both were also in close contact with me since we all live in the same household. Everyone practically experienced the same thing I did. Just a stuffy nose and nothing else. Yet everyone else in my household was still pretty concerned about Covid so of course they got the jab and told me I needed it because I have a heart condition.</p>
<p>I should have asked why I did when I was able to recover from it just fine. Yet of course I decided to get it anyway just to make the rest of my family "feel better". Anyway I get the first shot and of course I experience side effects like everyone else. It ranged from having periods of feeling hot to feeling cold, felt fatigue here and there, experienced some brain fog and a sore arm (where I got jabbed). Had roughly the same experience the second time around as well. Of course the brain fog could just be from my self-diagnosed depression.</p>
<p>It toke MONTHS for the sore arm to go away. Which was really odd that was the thing that was consistent was just frequent arm pain or soreness. Sure I still feel fatigue every now and then but that could be from a combination of being depressed and obese anyway. Also no I did not go to Krispy Kreme to get a free donut after getting vaccinated. That whole thing seemed just really silly plus I DON'T WANT SOME KRISPY KREME EMPLOYEE TO KNOW MY MEDICAL HISTORY. I refuse even with the jab to show I got it. We never had to show proof we got the flu shot before why is this any different?! "Oh but Covid is more deadly than the Flu." The only reason why Covid is more deadly than the Flu is because it's A NEW VIRUS. That's it nothing else! It still takes lives, it still makes people ill, there is nothing more special about it than the Flu.</p>
<p>What I am trying to say is even with someone who is Obese and might have a heart condition or two YOU STILL DON'T NEED THE VACCINE! I was able to recover just fine from Covid. The only reason I got the vaccine was so my family could "feel better" or "feel safer" around me. That is it I didn't even have a choice to get it or not on my own. If I was living somewhere with the girlfriend I wouldn't have gotten the shot.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE <strong>YOUNG</strong> YOU ARE FINE, IF YOU ARE <strong>OLD BUT YOU ARE HEALTHY</strong> YOU ARE FINE, IF YOU <strong>HAD COVID BUT RECOVERED</strong> YOU ARE FINE. YOU DON'T NEED THE VACCINE IF YOU ARE ANY OF THOSE THREE WHICH SHOULD BE COMMON SENSE BUT IT'S NOT! WE WENT FROM GETTING A VACCINE IF YOU NEED IT TO GETTING IT BECAUSE IT'S THE....</p>
<p>"<strong>POLITICALLY</strong> RIGHT THING TO DO!"</p>
<p>Tldr: I am obese with a heart condition that had Covid. Was able to recover from it, but got the vaccine because of my household. Experienced side effects from the vaccine, but was able to recover. Suffered more mentally than from this pandemic and vaccine (thus far). I wanted to write this not only to share my experience, but if something does happen to me I want to share my story from getting Covid and getting the vaccine. Again this is me <strong>sharing my personal experience</strong> and I am not here to promote getting the vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I definitely have thought about it. It's been a tough journey. At one point I was really on top of it, but something happened that caused me to stop. I don't know what the reason was. Perhaps it was a mental thing. Or I was focused more with my job situation which caused me to lose focus on my health situation. Lately i've been more depressed from the whole Covid shit ontop of losing my job in a couple of months and barely have the motivation to get up to go to work let alone worrying about my health. So yeah I want to improve everything both my work and eating habits. I just hope I can get out of this recent mental situation.</p>

        <p>You don't need to go balls to the walls straight away, you can start with 10.000 steps a day and progress from there, it's probably 5miles and 1 hour walking, listen to some music, audio book, or a podcast to not get bored. Wish you the best!</p>

        <p>Even 10k steps might be unrealistic for a overweight unfit person with a heart issue - start easy and build up to an hour.</p>
<p>Even for a generally fit 50-something like me (with an artificial knee), a 5 mile walk takes about 90 minutes (I live somewhere reasonably flat)</p>

        <p>Thanks for this. It's good to also hear from people besides those who claim to be young and healthy.</p>

        <p>Not a problem I wanted to give a 100% personal experience from dealing with both the Covid and vaccine. I didn't want to leave anything out including my health issues, experiences with Covid and Moderna, etc. I believe in people deciding what's right to do for themselves and not because they have to.</p>

        <p>New study came out: immunity from prior infection is 95% effective against infection for at least 7 months. That's even better than the vaccine</p>
