    <strong>Am I a hypocrite, NNN? (Question-sort-of-Rant)</strong>
    <p><p>You know how the stereotypical redditor is about kids and their parents? That's literally my brother to a T. He's also a huge fan of "found families" who also has literally no use for family who (in his exact words) "haven't done anything for me" and is ready, willing, and able to just cut someone out of his life completely over some real or imagined slight, something that caused my 'ma no small amount of angst, since he did it to a cousin who was basically an older sister to us growing up.</p>
<p>But my brother and his (probable) personality disorder(s) not withstanding, since we've had our own thoughts on the matter, I've always been the exact opposite of him: I've spent years talking about how important it is for families to support each other(not enabling addictions and general bad habits, mind you), want to be a dad with at least three kids someday with ambitions of being that kindly, mildly-eccentric old patriarch figure who family members come to for advice and to settle disputes.</p>
<p>But the new abnormal and the fanatical allegiance pretty much all of my family shares to it, my dissidence and unsuccessful attempts at red-pilling, and my comparison of the situation to Lot in Sodom have led me to wonder: Am I a hypocrite, NNN? The guy who's spent so much time talking about how important it is for families to have each others backs, who doesn't see any choice but to leave this hellhole behind and allow his family to enjoy it as they please? Even though I know there's a not-zero possibility of all hell breaking loose due to the mRNA gene therapy shots?</p>
<p>Keep in mind, I've spent hours trying to explain how dangerous these experimental mRNA gene therapies are potentially and they were either too fearful of the 'rona, trusting of the Mockingbird propaganda, or (in the case of my brother) just too lazy to educate themselves on the matter. And yes, judging by their behavior over the past year, they will hate/scapegoat/turn in anyone the MSM propagandists tell them too, myself included. The Two Minutes' Hate was <em>not</em> figurative. And as I've already stated, our state dictator is an evil, satanic fuck just salivating at the opportunity to crush "plague rats" like myself once and for all. My statement about how they'd have to kill me before they inject me with this shit stands, BTW.</p>
<p>I've aired a lot of my family's dirty laundry over the new abnormal, I admit. Fuck, I must have written an entire novel-worth of text about it by now. Seriously, there's more drama involved than a long-running Mexican telenovella. But I know I'm not the only one with a hard-luck story concerning friends and family going all in on the insanity. Fuck, I know some people here have even been disowned outright due to their family members becoming new abnormal cultists, but I don't really have anywhere else to talk about this.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Literally every human being is a hypocrite about something or another, present company included. At the very least, I try not to be one anyway.</p></p>

        <p>It’s not health or normal to have no “boundaries” when it comes to people, including family. </p>
<p>There are definitely snowflakes who will cut someone out over any perceived slight. As a non-American (by birth, live here now), I think the destruction of family and general encouragement to go “NC” over everything is part of the downfall of the West. </p>
<p>But...nobody has to tolerate true abuse. If your family is past disagreement on the issue and is truly abusing you, there is no moral obligation to stick around.</p>

        <p>I think there is a middle ground. I’m a found family person, and I absolutely believe that family earns respect, it’s not just there because they are family. This stuff is dividing people and it’s very hard</p>

        <p>Are they trying to coerce you into getting the vaccine?  If not, I would just live and let live. If they want to get the vaccine, they are adults and it’s their choice.  If they refuse to see you if you don’t get the vaccine, that is completely on them and you are not the one choosing to cut them out of your life; they are cutting you out.  Which would really be sad, if that is the case.</p>

        <p>Jesus said, Let the dead bury the dead.</p>
<p>That's my go-to thought when thinking about people I care about. People aren't saved by the truth, rather they are called to it. Many refuse to hear the calling, including people we love.</p>
