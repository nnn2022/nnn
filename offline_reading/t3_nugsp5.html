    <strong>I, a medical researcher have definitive proof that the mandated COVID safety protocols are completely unnecessary.</strong>
    <p><p>Over the past few months, I have grown increasingly dubious about the authenticity of the information being presented to citizens of my country, and to the people across the globe. I witness COVID patients come and go on a daily basis, and I can 100% guarantee it is NOT as scary as the media tells you it is.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many influential media sources are promoting COVID safety measures (such as staying 6ft apart, excessively sanitize your hands, wearing masks, etc), but rarely do you find any certified doctors that can confirm the efficiency and necessity of those safety measures. However, abiding by those safety guidelines has become some sort of "common knowledge", and those who refuse to conform are regarded as "anti-science" or "selfish". In reality, there were rarely any medical professionals who agree, it's always either the government or social media.</p>
<p><strong>My findings over the past few months:</strong></p>
<p>First of all, nearly all COVID-related statistics have been falsified. Especially the COVID death rate, the already low 1.5% could be lowered to 0.01% since most "COVID" deaths are actually indirect deaths, some of them very remotely related to the virus itself. An average healthy person (or even with minor health conditions) can recover from the virus in usually less than 2 weeks, only showing mild symptoms during the time span between contraction and recovery. </p>
<p>Summer is quickly approaching, and from my medical experience viruses and other communicable diseases spread FAR slower under high temperatures, and the coronavirus is no exception. During the summertime, the virus has been proved to spread 78% slower, and people are far less likely to contract the virus, to the point that <strong>NONE of the coronavirus safety protocols would be needed!</strong> </p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is, you would find NO information like this on any major media source right now, and I am pissed that the truth is not being told to people. Hope you found this post useful.</p></p>

        <p>My mom had cancer and got covid the week of her chimio. She spent over a month at the hospital because she got it. She was super sick for a week and then very weak but she got through it and also her cancer (which was not too aggressive.. think like stage 1) disappeared because her white cells were so low for so long. </p>
<p>Long story short my mom is well alive despite being over 60 and having cancer while getting covid. </p>
<p>Not afraid nor affected by this covid propaganda anymore.</p>
