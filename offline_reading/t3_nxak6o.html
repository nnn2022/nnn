    <strong>Similarities between real life and Marvel's MCU movies?</strong>
    <p><p>Now that I think about it, some of marvel's movies also had some eerily predictive programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Captain America the winter soldier 2014 movie with Hydra (the enemies) growing inside SHIELD secretly (reference to traitors in our governments secretly taking over), and one of the villains, Arnim Zola, actually said "Hydra's <strong>New World Order</strong> will rise", when Captain America and black widow were on their rogue mission...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Avengers: Endgame, There's the entire time jump to 2023 with the world in ruins after Thanos does his thing (in the real world, our reality, it would be the elites with their possible agendas behind the scenes that connect to 2030's great reset)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain America Civil War 2016 movie: Iron man's ideology vs Captain america's (who is against surrendering their rights to choose if they sign the Sokovia Accords), matches up with the vaccinated against the unvaccinated, fighting to keep the right to choose if they want to get vaccinated or not. <strong>(we are at this point)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Thanos snap" would be the vaccines potentially killing everyone, or "Hulk snap" where the vaccines end up saving lives, but also having a double edged sword (with unpredictable side effects in the long run, like hulk's snap when he brought back everybody, but also unleashed chaos after the world has adapted to less people in 5 years) This point is too early to tell for now, we have to wait more months until we can tell the outcome of these vaccines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Thanos" would probably represent the elites pulling the strings behind the scenes, and are the main antagonists. Avengers Infinity War (2018)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of the above point, Thanos' "depopulation" agenda fits quite well too with the potential Agenda 21/2030 plan, assuming if its true? Again, so far this is too early to tell (its only 2021)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UNRELATED: Covid-23 movie, Songbird (released in 2020)</p>
</li>
</ul></p>
