    <strong>At what point do we do something?</strong>
    <p><p>I think we're all getting to the point where we're realizing that the government has no intention to give up it's new found power, and go back to how we were before covid showed up.  My question is, at what point do we actually do something to fight back?  Sure we can post here all we want, and the more people we get to realize the sham all of this is the better, but that alone will not change anything. </p>
<p>Will it be mandatory vaccines that finally cause us to stand up to tyranny, one full year of "quarantine?"  I'm sick and tired of all of this, and I want to do something more than just not wear my mask, or break lockdown restrictions, but it seems that no one wants to actually do anything to put an end to all of this.  I'm not entirely sure what that would be, whether it be protesting, actually trying to get politicians overstepping their power removed from power, or voting in anti-lockdown politicians, I'm not sure.  All I know, is it's time to do something, it's time to put an end to this.</p></p>

        <p>We didn't fight back after the 9-11 patriot act/homeland security/tsa "for our protection and safety" power grab and that was almost twenty years ago.  Why would this "for our protection and safety" power grab be any different.</p>

        <p>You're right, the freedom killing Patriot Act should have been fought against, but it was too subtle and was more behind the scenes, laying the groundwork for what we are experiencing today.  The average plebe back in 2001 had no idea of the implications of the Patriot Act.  The only real world consequence people saw after 9/11 was some increased security measures at airports like having to take off their shoes and belts and scan them before boarding an airplane.   Slightly annoying but nowhere near as invasive and "in your face" as what people are experiencing now.   </p>
<p>People should be fighting back at this point, but will they?</p>

        <p>It has definitely ramped up.  If you were online at that time, there wasn't as much (or maybe not as obvious) attempts to divide. I didn't really notice the coordinated "grassroots" organizations until around the gulf oil spill.  And again during the Obama v McCain presidential election.  Now there seems to be organized attacks on all sides against every single thing imaginable. I hate to think this way, but I can't fathom that people will ever coalesce against our common enemies when our enemies are winning through the age old divide and conquer strategy. You would think people would wise up to this fact but apparently not.</p>

        <p>In my mind, 9/11 was a totally plausible threat. Most of us watched it on the TV when it happened and it was totally shocking. People jumping 80 stories to their death, buildings collapsing on live television. There was a totally credible threat of terrorism and maybe more terrorist attacks. That is why people went along with it.</p>
<p>Coronavirus is not the same at all, yet after 9 months literally no one from the opposite viewpoint is changing their mind at all about it, despite what we know about the actual death rate. We just have to convince them one by one.</p>

        <p>911 narrative was credible? Ha! They knew who was responsible before they could even start an investigation. How's that possible? All that showed was Americans ability to think critically was shot to hell and they'd believe anything as long as an "authority figure" said it. Anyone who looks five minutes into 9/11 will find huge holes in the narrative. Same with this covid mess.</p>

        <p>I’m planning on printing out some graphics with statistics about the true death rates, effects of the lockdowns and putting them up around my school. Anyone think that’s a good idea? Or a dumb one? </p>
<p>I honestly think there are some cities that will never rebel. People in NY seem all too happy to let Cuomo destroy our city. Now they’re talking about putting certain communities under lockdown again and nothing. “Mask police”, nothing. Telling people not to talk on subways and busses, nothing. All of the small businesses that are gone forever, nothing. $1000 fine for not wearing a mask, nothing.</p>

        <p>I would say it's a good idea to expose the fraud to your peers as long as you don't get caught.  You don't want to get thrown out of school, and I think that's exactly what could happen.  Or worse, possible criminal charges.  You would need to evaluate your support system and "safety net" (parents, friends, etc.) to know people will have your back so you're not left hanging alone if it hits the fan. And make sure you can back up your statistics with verifiable data, should you do this, because you know people will come at you - CYA with indisputable facts.</p>

        <p>Gotta admit I am very troubled at the way things are headed. It seems that the majority of people will probably go along with an eventual mandatory vaccination campaign. They will bring it in stages.. like the slow boil. First, all the healthcare workers. And if you want to travel on a plane. Then the children. Etc.</p>
<p>I don't see how any sort of typical political activism can turn this trend around when the majority of people have been consumed by the fear propaganda. So my current plan is to work on a self-sufficiency/prepping project, crossed with a sort of very a-typical activism:</p>
<p>I'm going to buy a few hundred acres and start a religious movement and build a commune. Planning to make the commune as self sufficient/independent as possible. Going to use the religious aspect to illustrate to people that the <em>institutions</em> built up around religion have become corrupt, but the core teachings are valuable and provide a solid framework for building society. If this movement garners enough attention, we can use it as a platform to speak out against state overreach. If it doesn't get enough attention, then we just sort of live in relative isolation and continue to prepare for the great tribulation.</p>

        <p>&rt;  My question is, at what point do we actually do something to fight back? </p>
<p>i have pondered on this question since march, here is a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Honolulu/comments/g6sqek/when_do_the_protests_begin/">post i made</a> on the local sub, when this thing first started, see the replies that i received, do you think these people will do anything?</p>
<p>&rt; I'm not entirely sure what that would be, whether it be protesting,...</p>
<p>useless</p>
<p>&rt;  actually trying to get politicians overstepping their power removed from power,</p>
<p>getting warmer</p>
<p>&rt;  or voting in anti-lockdown politicians, </p>
<p>i have yet to see or hear about one of these here in the people's republic of hawaii, one month from election day</p>
<p>generally voting is futile and serves only to manufacture consent</p>
<p>&rt; I'm not sure. All I know, is it's time to do something, it's time to put an end to this.</p>
<p>the only way this is ends is by tar and feathering (if that will suffice) ALL of them. the bilderburgs, the CFR, the WEF, club of rome, the politicians, the bureaucrats, their 'experts', their muscle, every member of of ALL the relevant "NGOs" and all the member of the not for taxation 'foundations' (especially them), the ceos and top minions of the giant multinational corps, the ceos and top minions of the banks, the media big wigs and every fucking jezzie that controls them all</p>
<p>while the state is legal fiction, it's owners and minions, etc are not. they are each of them men (and women), same as us. </p>
<p>not a revolution, this is self defense i am talking about.</p>

        <p>You can spread the word to people you know. Another idea I was considering was contacting your local state rep if the state government hasn't stopped with their restrictions and etc. Perhaps if enough people made their concerns about the government overreach known, the state reps will start to do something. I was considering this idea to challenge and question the state mask mandate and gatherings limit after monitoring Florida and some other states that lifted their restrictions.</p>

        <p>We need to fight back, not with physical violence (unless it is self defense) but with large scale protesting and other forms of activism. Sure the media will cry and whine but the more attention they give us the better.</p>

        <p>Our governor has stated that we will not progress to the next phase or remove the mask mandate until a vaccine is available.</p>
<p>The house and senate are both republican controlled and they only make murmurs on occasion about doing something to stop him.</p>

        <p>Good question that I have no answer to. This started long before COVID, and yet here we are. People draw the line, erase it, draw the line again, rinse and repeat. I fear this is a runaway reaction and the only way out is through.</p>
