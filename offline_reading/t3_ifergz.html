        <p>This is so sad. My 4th and 6th graders struggle enough as it is (both have cried in frustration at least once- and it has only been a week)! If I had a kindergartner I would disenroll and homeschool him- NO question. The only reason I haven’t done the same for my older kids, is that they are in a specific language immersion program and could potentially lose their spots. You could homeschool a kindergartner in an hour a day- Supplemented by lots of reading and limited time on fun educational apps (still screentime- but much more engaging and fun than the “online learning” from school)  he could do while mom is taking care of the baby. Otherwise- let him play- ideally outdoors and at the park with other kids. </p>
<p>They REALLY should have prioritized in-school learning for the youngest kids first. Certainly K-3 or K-5. Not that I think any of the schools should be closed at all...but the youngest group should’ve been first priority for a large number of reasons!</p>

        <p>I'm worried that this what people are going to think homeschooling is like, and that's just not the case. The friends I have that homeschool don't do virtual/online school at all, and use curriculum that requires a lot of prep, research, and parent/child involvement. From what I've observed, REAL homeschool done the right way is truly amazing for the students.</p>

        <p>It is heartbreaking. His mom is overwhelmed (has baby) and cannot keep up with the emails/orders from the teachers. </p>
<p>I think if it were my 5-year-old I would petition to homeschool and then try to get a sitter for a couple hours each day and blast through reading and math only. (I realize sitter costs money which family may not have.)  Realistically he's learning nothing online with the public schools and it's actually damaging him. He will be ahead of his public school peers with even a little individualized instruction. Still an awful situation for kids across the country of all ages.</p>
<p>EDIT: Or hold him back a year and start K at age 6. I don't think anything will be different next fall, but there's a teeny sliver of hope.</p>

        <p>Well, "Kate for Congress" sure screwed the pooch by putting her big ole loud audio commercial across the bottom of the news story.</p>
<p>If the parents are busting their asses teaching the kids, then they should get the salary, not the teachers. Looks like the teachers are depending on the parents doing their job for them.</p>
