    <strong>I hate the doomers, snitches, mask evangelists, pro-lockdowners, etc.</strong>
    <p><p>At first they were annoying, but I feel a borderline homicidal rage at this point when dealing with them. I hate them on a visceral level. Never have I wanted to hurt anyone as much as these people.</p>
<p>They have destroyed everything I enjoy about life. Taken away every thing I did. Prevent me from seeing people close to me. Have done untold damage to the community. Made me live in fear everyday of losing my job and livelihood. Prevented me from being with my grandfather during his last three months of life.</p>
<p>I can not truly express my hatred for them and their hysteria in text. I think of them and feel uncontrollable rage.</p>
<p>I hope when this is all said and done every single one of them gets what's coming to them. Frankly I hope they do get COVID and suffer greatly from it, they deserve no less.</p></p>

        <p>This is exactly how they want us to feel toward each other. Focus on yourself and try your best not to feed into the rage.</p>

<p>They will, but they can't see it. </p>
<p>If you're advocating for any of this shit you are advocating for globalism, and communism. Millions of people are unwittingly joining the communist party and have no clue they are doing it because they've been conditioned to think that's a "conspiracy theory", which has been turned into a pejorative term for making people sound crazy, which is the actual plan that has been used for hundreds of years by the commies during their subversions of western governments. </p>
<p>Useful idiots. Every single one of them.</p>

        <p>Don't pay much attention to these trolls. They are mostly visible and active on reddit, but I guarantee you won't see many of these kind in real life.</p>
<p>I think the majority people just go along with masks, because they want no trouble from police (fines) and just want to continue working at their workplace without any problems.</p>

        <p>Your rage is exactly what they want. They love focusing on us lashing out and saying "THESE are the people who want to end lockdown. You really want to be a part of this group?" Channel your energy to focus on dismantling this system that is more than happy to treat us like cattle. It feels good.</p>
