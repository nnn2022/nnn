    <strong>Do things just feel kind of stuck right now?</strong>
    <p><p>Like the states that have embraced the restrictions I feel like they are never going back to normal. On one hand states like Texas and Florida are practically there already. I suppose it feels stuck because I haven't watched much news lately. Lord is it annoying constantly seeing the fearmongering the news creates. It's not even creative anymore just feels like copy pasta doom. It just feels like the states that are keeping the restrictions around are going to do it forever. However, I kind of don't want to make the hasty decision to move to Texas or Florida to be free leaving my family and friends behind. Then to find out a month from now my state is opened back up. I am kind of at a loss here. Or perhaps it's just good to move overall. If my state is dragging this out still who's to say they won't do the same thing when another "pandemic" hits.</p></p>

        <p>When I was a kid I used to go to my aunt's camp on the lake in the summer a lot. One of my favorite things to do was sit on the screened-in front porch and watch bad thunderstorms coming from across the lake. You would see the sky turn black across the lake while it was still shining on where you were sitting. Gradually a black sheet of rain and wind came closer and closer while we ran around bringing all the random lawn chairs and towels hanging outside drying before we got soaked. That's exactly what I feel like right now. Something very bad is coming, I can almost see it and smell it. Don't know what it is but I know something's coming. And when it gets here, we are going to have to hunker down and hold on tight until it passes and the Sun comes out again.</p>

        <p>Things are back to normal here in Texas, aside from the few people that still wear the masks. I don't wear one, and nobody says anything to me. Part of that is that people mind their fucking business here, and more and more people are just done with the bullshit. Austin is still a shithole and it's turning into LA though.</p>

        <p>Houstonian here. I have been hassled a few times at stores about masks but now that I know where I can go freely its not so much of an issue. My bigger concern is the astounding number of people I see milling about on walks and riding bikes wearing masks OUTSIDE, where it was never mandated. I have a feeling we wont be going back to a true normal ever in our lifetimes.</p>

        <p>Where do you live? I’m in a blue state and everyone is out and about. Just the bullshit security theater with the masks and all. Places close early as well. I suggest to try living your life and ignore the bullshit as much as possible</p>

        <p>Yes. My state (IL) was supposed to ease restrictions as more people got vaccinated. However, cases and hospitalizations didn’t decrease, so the restrictions remained in place. We have 50% of the adult population having received at least their first dose, so herd immunity isn’t terribly far away. But, what’s especially frustrating is that the mask mandate will remain in place until the CDC says otherwise, which could be months away</p>

        <p>Your last sentence is exactly why I want to leave NY. That's relatively easy for me because I'm not from here, but I did love it and I'm pissed off about the prospect of having to start over. I wanted my kid to finish school here. There's a housing shortage and a lumber shortage, so I probably can't even afford to move. The whole thing is daunting. It really is.</p>

        <p>I agree. It feels like that in good ole Pennsylvania too. Our governor is criticizing other states that are dropping the mask mandate and saying there's no future plans of doing so.</p>
