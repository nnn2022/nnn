    <strong>I'm really bummed out right now. M</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know why this is affecting me so much. I graduated 23 years ago and I don't know the kid...</p>
<p>I have a ten year old boy in the same school district I attended when I was a kid. The district superintendent sent an email to all the parents letting us know a freshman committed suicide today. The high school (only) has been closed for a couple weeks now and is going to be closed at least until after Thanksgiving, and the state currently has a curfew... </p>
<p>I don't know why the child did it but I'm sure the stress from the fear mongering MSM and not being able to see friends didn't help the situation.</p>
<p>If you are considering taking your own life because of covid or the response to it, I understand...  This I an unprecedented situation and it's totally normal to feel some worry/fear/anxiety/sadness/anger either about the virus or the response to it. Please try to find some help. If we are to defeat this new normal we need you.  </p>
<p>(I'm not necessarily opposed to the possibility of a new normal. The old one had plenty of problems. I AM opposed to a bunch of billionaires developing their idea of a new normal and foisting it on us without considering our input.) </p>
<p>Take care.</p></p>

        <p>Ya so just to share a little story that informs my  perspective here. When I was an intern, I was working the night shift in the icu and we get this kid from the trauma bay who had shot himself in the head. He was I think 16 years old and had recently broken up with his girlfriend. Took one look at the CT scan and it was very clear that he wasnâ€™t going to make it. At 3 in the morning, I literally had to talk to this kids family about the fact that his brain had been destroyed and we had to talk about next steps, organ procurement etc. They decided to extubate him and he died maybe like 6AM. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s difficult to describe the utter shock, horror, and despair I saw in his parentâ€™s eyes. Just trying to comprehend that this wasnâ€™t a dream, their son had in fact committed suicide, and they would have to live with this pain for the rest of their lives trying to make sense of what happened. His mother was inconsolable and the dad was weeping the entire time. He had a sister and a brother that were also in the room. You could literally see the pain in eyes of this family. Thereâ€™s just nothing you can say to comfort someone in that situation, you just have to know that you are there to listen help guide them through these difficult decisions as best you can. </p>
<p>Anyways I just want to say that I also took a care of a lot of elderly people as they died. One of the patients I took care of was 103 years old. She was dying of pneumonia and advanced heart failure. Her entire extended family was in the room huddled around her all night. I had been called to look at her ekg, saw an agonal rhythm, and informed the family that this was not a good sign and I didnâ€™t think she was going to be with us much longer. Sure enough she died a bit later that night. Now her family clearly loved her very much, and I definitely saw some tears but that situation was more touching than sad. They knew she had lived a good long life and this was simply her time to go. </p>
<p>The whole point of this long winded story is simply that when it comes to suicide of a teenager vs. the death of an elderly person from natural causes, there simply is no comparison. </p>
<p>The teen suicide is just so much worse... in so many ways. </p>
<p>I just wish more people could see these covid death numbers with a little more perspective, thatâ€™s all.</p>

        <p>Curfew so I'm guessing your in Communistfornia? Suicide is up there like 500% over last year. Drug overdoses and child abuse even higher. They don't care about anything there other than Covid. Fully single digit IQ level governance and the entire state is racing to collapse any day now from the shutdown.</p>
