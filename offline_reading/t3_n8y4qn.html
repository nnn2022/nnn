    <strong>Starting to have concerns</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys. I've been lurking in the sub for a while now and just very recently becoming very active in it. I don't agree with the mask mandates, vaccine passport, and all that stuff. I want this crap to be done and over with now.</p>
<p>Censorship is a big deal, especially on other sub reddits where we can't even so much as question about the vaccine or show any hesitancy at all without ridicule or just being completely censored or banned.</p>
<p>At the risk of being heavily downvoted, I've noticed that we are downvoting and ridiculing a lot of people in this sub that have legitimate concerns or questions. I know that they may not be on our side on things, but how can we convince them of our views if we downvote, ridicule, or even go as far as removing said comments (one of the comments on my last post was removed when someone had asked me to source something)?</p>
<p>Censorship and ridicule for asking reasonable and fair questions is not the answer here. I know it gets done to us all the time but we are supposed to be on higher ground here. We are supposed to be trying to stop this new normal bullcrap. Not do to them what is being done to us because it'll never end.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I am being... whatever.. but this is something that needs to be addressed. Can we please talk about this?</p></p>

        <p>Whenever someone comments something that goes against the theme of the sub downvotes ALWAYS happen. There's no stopping it so don't worry about it. What you and the people being downvoted should worry about is is this sub going to censor them? so far no unless they are clearly trolling.</p>

        <p>There's actually a book I'm reading that's about this. I believe it's a sham, the mask is to see who is going to cooperate and the vaccine is the virus or whatever. I believe that they are trying to do a one world order and that they are going by a timeline and a laundry list of goals that they want to meet. </p>
<p>The book that talks about this is "Conspirators Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of the 300".</p>

        <p>I honestly don't know, but if I had to take an educated guess, I'd have to say people who are involved are making money off of this, all these governments get to control more people, more power, etc. In my experience it's all about money and power. They don't care about us. They never did. It's all about me, myself, and my money at the end of the day.</p>

        <p>&rt;Any idea how the US, Iran, Pakistan, India, North Korea and China all managed to play ball together?</p>
<p>Yes, this is called "global health" approach that has been worked on for many years. By many, many institutions funded by very rich conglomerates.</p>
<p>&rt;Every doctor and nurse just casually agreeing to the set up?</p>
<p>Do you believe that a doctor or nurse just treats you based on his own ideas? The sad truth is, you are working by the book, what was published in the latest medical publications on how to treat this illness is how you will treat it. If you dont, and your treatment fails you are open to liability and can get sued to bancrupcy. Pretty simple system of coercion.</p>

<p>And thats were you are utterly uninformed. "React" is simply untrue. There have been plenty of pandemic prepardness exercises that planned it all through. Just watch Event 201 - its on youtube, and tell me that what Bill &amp; Melinda Gates, WHO, CDC and others did there is not exactly what happens.</p>
<p>See, that is already a part of "the conspiracy". Every official who claims unpreparedness or "there is no plan for how to deal with a pandemic" is straight up lying in your face. Of course there are protocols on how to deal with a pandemic and this one is dealt with by book (again watch Event 201).</p>

        <p>That is not true, and it is a dangerous view to hold, that we’ll never convince anyone, and we, likewise, just shut our ears and minds to any information that doesn’t agree with us. I have actually had good discussions with multiple people, who left with changed views or at least more respect for us.</p>

        <p>Actually, yes! </p>
<p>I used to be a doomer in the beginning of the pandemic—I even had a huge stash of masks and wore an N95 every time I went to any public place—but after someone showed me the data, and explained what was going on, I changed my mind.</p>

        <p>Ah, okay—I thought what you had meant was generally being convinced to go from one side of the issue to the other.</p>
<p>Really, though, it wasn’t from one extreme to the other—I was one of the r/Wuhan_Flu crowd, and the idea back then was that the government was hiding something. We thought that what was being hidden were the “leaks” from China about mass death, cremations, people dropping dead in the street, etc. Then some of us realized that it wasn’t true, and the numbers and sources from other, freer countries just weren’t telling that same story, and they did their research on it all, and came to the startling conclusion that the pandemic was theatre and convinced a lot of other people—no small feat, considering the rest of us were in full on zombie apocalypse prepping/survival mode, convinced we would die of cytokine storms on ventilators with damaged lungs and hearts and whatnot.</p>
<p>One thing the doomer side has actually convinced me of, though, is that there were excess deaths in 2020, though I do not think, based on the data, that they are COVID deaths; rather, they are the result of the lockdowns—a case where the “cure” is worse than the disease.</p>

        <p>My view, though, did not swing from one extreme to another; while I may have what you think is an extreme view, it didn’t change drastically. </p>
<p>I base my change of views on excess deaths on the fact that the only scientific analysis I was able to find stating there were none was flawed, and the raw data does suggest some excess deaths in America. I am not familiar with Japanese data, but presuming you guys didn’t basically lock down your cities for a year and fire a bunch of people from their jobs, I would think you wouldn’t have any excess deaths. Here in America, we have excess deaths because we have libtard big cities that locked down everyone, causing job loss, poverty, drug/alcohol abuse, suicides, and hesitancy to seek medical care for fear of catching COVID.</p>

<p>What did you base your view on originally? What science did you look to to come to the conclusion that the death rate was higher?</p>
<p>&rt;I am not familiar with Japanese data, but presuming you guys didn’t basically lock down your cities for a year and fire a bunch of people from their jobs, I would think you wouldn’t have any excess deaths.</p>
<p>Different people do things differently. Most people don't need to be told not to go out over here. Most people just stopped hitting the bars. </p>
<p>A lot of sports grounds closed. </p>
<p>Soem restaurants volunteered to close at a certain part of the year, with a bit of bribery. </p>
<p>&rt; Here in America, we have excess deaths because we have libtard big cities that locked down everyone, causing job loss, poverty, drug/alcohol abuse, suicides, and hesitancy to seek medical care for fear of catching COVID.</p>

        <p>Well, originally, there wasn’t much research done yet, as it was too early in the game for studies, so our evidence was the “leaks” from China, plus the genome of the virus, which was similar both SARS and HIV, so we could only extrapolate that its death rate must be high because its relatives, so to speak, had high death rates.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you need to point out how a person is collaborating with the global fascism that has risen in every democracy around the world. Their collaboration in this "New Normal" is what gives it power. Many pro lockdown people here with legitimate concerns or questions have never been challenged to consider their part in all of this.</p>
<p>They genuflect and virtue signal about masks, but never seem to think about or discuss the way in which they supported the government labeling their family or friends or neighbors or countrymen "Non-Essential" and threw them into poverty. All in the name of "Science". They have never considered the number of hypochondriacs and agoraphobes they have created with the policies they support. They have never consider the number of children who have been taught to fear socialization, at a time when science explains it is most important for them to socialize and see each other's faces. Children who scientifically have a 99.998% chance of survival if they get the thing, probably better if the CDC broke down the figure beyond 0-17 and showed that almost no one under 12 or 13 has contracted it.</p>
<p>&rt;Not do to them what is being done to us because it'll never end.</p>
<p>That's the cruel reality of the world, buddy. It won't ever end. There is no key level of "Niceness" that will "end it." It doesn't matter how nice you are or how mean you are - people will always disagree. While you are right, it's always better to have a modicum of decorum - You shouldn't fear challenging those who disagree with you out of a fear of upsetting them. You can't really have a reasonable and fair discussion if you never challenge them, and generally speaking people who disagree with you on any topic might get "Upset" with the disagreement.</p>
