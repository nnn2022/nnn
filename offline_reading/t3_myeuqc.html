        <p>They shut down every time there is one positive case. Is that a kind of life you’d like to live? They’re also trapped in their countries, have been for a year. Not to mention New Zealand’s population can fit in one neighborhood where I live- completely incomparable. 
Their goal is 0 covid, which is just beyond silly. That’s like saying, hey no freedom until no one ever gets sick ever again</p>

        <p>NZer here.  Kindly allow me to disabuse you of just some of your misconceptions.</p>
<p>&rt; They shut down every time there is one positive case.</p>
<p>This is a lie.  Since the initial, successful, nationwide measures were introduced in early 2020, resulting in the elimination of the virus within the community, there have been just three short, regional lockdowns where the virus appeared to be spreading within the community and the source or degree of infection was not known.  These have resulted, happily, in arresting the spread and allowing a very swift re-opening to normal life.  We have been lucky and we know it. </p>
<p>&rt;They’re also trapped in their countries</p>
<p>This is a lie.  We have been able to leave whenever we wish, subject to being able to afford and book a flight out on the hugely reduced number of passenger flights.  Returning is different though and we now require all travellers, other than those from Australia, to quarantine in government controlled facilities (full service hotels) for 14 days.</p>
<p>&rt; New Zealand’s population can fit in one neighbourhood where I live</p>
<p>NZ has a population of 5 million.  Seems like a pretty crowded neighbourhood you're living in.</p>
<p>&rt; Their goal is 0 covid, which is just beyond silly.</p>
<p>Rather than "silly" It's exactly what we have.  Zero covid in the community.  Zero.  Nada,  Absolutely Fuck All.  The only cases active are in quarantine facilities at the border, returning New Zealanders who are of course allowed in because we are not trapped in our countries. </p>
<p>I thank you for your interest in our small nation.  Please be advised that the amount of misinformation, through malice, ignorance or sheer stupidity that we see written about us overseas is beyond disgusting to us.</p>

        <p>An actual kiwi here</p>
<p>We dont shut down after 1 positive case in the community we shut down once we lose control of the cases in the community.  There have been several occasions where there have been cases in the community and we have not needed to lockdown because we traced and isolated contacts of the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://covid19.govt.nz/travel-and-the-border/leaving-new-zealand/">we are not trapped in our own country</a>.  We can leave have been able to for over a year now. </p>
<p>What neighbourhood do you live in that can fit 5 million people?</p>
<p>Say what you want about zero covid it's worked pretty well</p>

        <p>That's false. There have been 3 instances in the last year where Auckland alone has had a lockdown (for 3,7 and 17 days). That's it! In each of these instances it was because the source of the cases was unknown (and remain so for two of them). There have been far more cases in the community that didnt have any affect or change to alert level. There was one last week with a border worker. No change.
   You are not trapped in the country and kiwis can leave the coutry to fly anywhere if you wish (it is expensive tho) and quaratine free travel is  happening with Australia.
  New Zealand has a small population (and a small healthcare system) but has a higher urbanisation rate than the US and the UK. 
   Zero covid was achieved and as above if you've lived outside of Auckland you've gone a whole year through the worst of a worldwide pandemic with no restrictions whatsoever on your normal day to day life. That's not no freedoms but all of them.</p>

        <p>I follow a few pro 2A pages here and I was engaged in a weird debate with an Australian that couldn't comprehend "why Americans love guns so much". I presented facts and unsurprisingly they reacted with an emotional stance accusing me of "lacking empathy" and that "sometimes we need to sacrifice some rights to make others feel mire secure". Seems like a method of thinking that also ties in with the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>The fact of the matter is that the largest armed force to have ever existed just happens to be a bunch of rednecks (guilty) and assorted lovable vermin who also happen to not care much for government overreach and who also happen to be clustered on the same continent. </p>
<p>I know that The Big Boys think that their Build Back Better thing is going to go off without a hitch because it's been pretty painless so far, but they seemed to have missed a crucial point: All their fancy-pants AI/ML models of human behavior left out the folks in the dark hollers, who don't have an Apple Watch or an Amazon account to stripmine for datapoints.</p>
<p>They've crushed the spirit of the latte drinking coastal elites and their overeducated inland minions, but they're very, very, very close to coming up to the hard limits of their predictive models. </p>
<p>They're not going to like it.</p>

        <p>Why does a low infection rate mean they’re doing well? That’s one metric. A much more important metric to me is freedom from draconian lockdown. Not to mention economic prosperity. If Covid was a serious threat, that might be different, but as it is you’re asking the wrong questions</p>

        <p>Since April last year (when the 1st lockdown ended) Auckland has had 27 additional days of lockdown and the rest of the country zero. That freedom has meant that economic activity and prosperity has been as near as normal (without tourism) as possible.</p>

        <p>Why not China? I mean, New Zealand is a small (beautiful) couple of islands in the middle of nowhere with a tiny (but great) population. </p>
<p>China, right smack dab in the middle of Asia, the same size as the US with 5 times the people. </p>
<p>Oh what, you don't believe China, but you believe New Zealand. </p>
<p>Italy had 11.6% seroprevalence of covid in September 2019 based on a random sample of 1000 people (for lung screening research). Apparently, they attributed it to a small surge in pneumonia and flu, but so small, you can't even find a google result of it being mentioned.</p>
<p>What's that? A country can have 1 in 9 people with covid and no restrictions for months and it is unnoticed? Strange. How's New Zealand doing again?</p>

        <p>They were able to shut down their small island country when CV arrived in the middle of their summertime when it was easy to control.  It arrived during peak respiratory season everywhere else. Easy to cut off an island as well since you just stop air travel and monitor cargo ships well.  Land countries are a bit harder.  Something like 30k trucks arrive daily to the US from Canada and Mexico with essentials. </p>
<p>They are also still essentially sequestered from the rest of the world like lepers.  Let's see how well they do when they open up more. Hopefully it works out for them.</p>

        <p>Counter question - Why do you think not a single new country has been able to repeat the NZ/AUS success since the beginning of this? WHy has not a single new country been added to that list of "countries that beat covid by following rules correctly"?</p>
<p>Is it just that nobody can match the unique world-famous powers of discipline possessed by the Aussies and Kiwis?</p>

        <p>I consider them to "before" NZ/AUS.   Yes. We know that Asian countries did well.  Who knows why? Early border closures are important but what else?  Tracing. </p>
<p>Cross-immunity?  </p>
<p>It does seem interesting that a grouping of countries in one particular corner of the world seem to have had an easier time.</p>
<p>But I mean since then. Since the "early days".  There hasnt been one new "western" country who has been added to the list.  Even "social" countries.</p>
<p>It seems to suggest there might be more going on then just "If they lust locked down like NZ they could do it too!"</p>
