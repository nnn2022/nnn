    <strong>I can't go on holiday because I'm at risk of blood clots but my SELFISH family is going without me!!</strong>
    <p><p>My family (Mama, Papi, Brother, Sister, Gam-Gam, Pop-Pop) are all anti-vax shit-head chuds who have decided to go on holiday to Spain. Even though I'm broke because I spent all my furlough money on masks, Covid test kits and hand sanitizer my parents agreed to pay for my ticket, even though this meant dipping into my University fund. I was okay with it at the time because I was looking forward to sitting by the pool (I can't swim anymore as I've lost the use of my legs; the doctors don't know why and I'm on my fourth round of tests).</p>
<p>Well, anyway, turns out I can't go as I'm "at risk" of getting blood clots whilst flying because of my vaccinated status. If you ask me this is complete and total discrimination! We only found out at the check-in gate as well! We'd already blown a bunch of money on our transportation to and from the airport (a popemobile; I refuse to be sat next to others due to Covid so I sat inside the glass case at the back of the car) so we were desperate to either get our money back or get on the plane somehow. The woman behind the desk (unmasked filth) lectured my parents (unmasked plague-rats), claiming all pilots that had had the vaccine were grounded and out of a job now. Same goes for passengers.</p>
<p>I was about ready to shrug this off and return home and write a nasty Yelp! review (to be honest I was terrified of going on holiday and being around other people anyway so this came as a relief) when I noticed a look between my parents. Right then I knew they were fucking planning on leaving me behind and going on the trip anyway! They squirmed awkwardly as they set about justifying this immensely selfish betrayel, claiming Gam-Gam and Pop-Pop deserved a "break" after the rough years they've spent in lockdown.</p>
<p>I had a full-blown meltdown right then and there in the airport and didn't stop screaming until we got home (I'm a bit concerned that I might have Covid as I was screaming in the glass container on the popemobile and the microparticles were trapped in with me). They've rebooked their holiday for next week and left me with some money (again, from my University fund; now I'll never get to do Gender Studies!); basically I'm going to be stuck inside all Summer whilst they go off to Spain and enjoy themselves!</p>
<p>This is totally unfair! THEY SHOULD ALL HAVE TO STAY IN WITH ME! SELFISH BASTARDS!!!</p></p>
