        <p>My wife and I were jabbed with the Pfrizer mRNA shot in Mid-March.  Since then she's had heavy, irregular menstrual cycles, frequent urination, and pelvic pain.</p>
<p>We're both in my 30s.  I'm M in my mid 30s and personally have experienced painful urination, frequent urination, "blockages" while urinating.  I thought I had Kidney stones.  I went to urgent care and the doctor wasn't sure what it was but just wrote me a script for amoxicillin anyway.  He thought it was a UTI but didn't do any tests.  I thought the Amox made it go away, but I was using urine test strips and had no leukocytes, no blood in urine, normal liver/kidney function.</p>
<p>I've "passed" things while urinating that are strange.  Not sure if it's me going crazy, some other health issue, or related to the vaccine.</p>
<p>I've had moderate pelvic pain, I'd say up to 6/10, frequent urination, very oddly smelling urination (even my dog smelled it and looked at me like WTF BRO?!?)  I swear.  I'm still feeling it now but it's slowly fading.  What's worked is frequent hydration, B-vitamins (flush niacin especially), vitamin D3, Vitamin K2, Vitamin C, Zinc, and a laundry list of other supplements</p>
<p>I have a lot of inside information about the medical system because I know a number of providers and hospital admins.  No one wants to question the vaccine, even doctors suspicious of it or believing it may be causing some effect are terrified of losing their license.  Younger doctors often have $300-500k of medical school debt in the USA and can't afford to lose their license.</p>
<p>I think there's some UTI/pelvic/bladder inflammation related to the Pfizer vaccine.  I can't prove it.  I haven't really gone through the VAERS data enough to really draw a correlation, but it doesn't matter anyway since everyone always assumes it's something else other than the "vaccine."</p>
<p>I'm going to refuse any booster.  This shot fucked us up and we both had natural immunity from Covid.  My wife has an auto-immune condition and her doctor urged us both to get the "vaccine."  I had my hesitations but just did it anyway.  I did a lot of research after receiving it, especially when side effects flared up.  Initially I had injection site pain, low grade fever, extreme fatigue, very concerning tinnitus, but it passed quickly.  The longer term side effects came about about a month or two after the 2nd jab and I'm terrified to know fully what is actually going on with me.  I don't trust the medical establishment.  I don't know who to turn to.</p>
<p>My employer mandated taking this shot, and I had to submit my documents which made me want to vomit.  I know it means I granted them consent to push me to get a booster.  We'll fight that battle when it comes.</p>
<p>I'm so demoralized.  I've become recently fatigued.  I had a case of the sniffles last week but didn't want to go and give them a positive PCR test.  Probably would have said it was the Delta variant or some bs.  I'm fine now but when I focus on all of this it makes me not want to go on, but I will because we must.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask any questions.</p>
<p>Peace and love.</p>

        <p>Thanks for pointing that out, and yes it's true.  Be careful with supplements as well!!  Just because they're over the counter doesn't mean you should just pop them like candy.</p>
<p>The smell was occurring before supplementing.  Shortly after my 2nd Pfizer shot.</p>

        <p>Thanks.  Time is making it better, along with good diet, exercise, supplements.</p>
<p>Everyone's told me it's not related to the vaccine at all but the fact it happened to my wife and I at the same time, I'm hearing it from others that had the Pfizer mRNA shot..... It just seems too coincidental.</p>
<p>I'm less concerned about this effect and more concerned about, what the hell is happening to my body?</p>
<p>I had a pretty bad case of Covid last year since I was obese and a heavy drinker.  I'm almost a year sober today and was feeling pretty good.  The vaccine 100% set back my recovery, but I'm feeling better day by day.</p>
<p>I'm terrified of being pressured into taking a booster.  I feel like I've already damaged myself permanently by getting this shot.  I'm scared about what continued injections would do to me.  They're even talking about injecting people every month for long covid.... I wish I was joking.</p>
<p>Trudeau already ordered boosters for 2022, 2023, and 2024....  I hate this timeline.  I'm American but that alone tells me all I need to know.</p>

        <p>Thank you.  I'm so grateful to be sober right now because all of this is heavy enough.  I know drinking won't make it worse.  If anything now is the time to prepare yourself for what's to come, whatever that is.  I see maintaining sobriety as key.</p>
<p>I did hit rock bottom last year.  I'm introverted and I thought lockdowns and working from home would be paradise.  It turned out to be a nightmare that made my social anxiety and alcoholism far worse.  I'm climbing out of that hell and stronger than ever before.</p>
<p>I do get overwhelmed by all of this and break down crying (this is fairly recent).  Still, the last thing I would ever do is reach for a drink.  I need to stay strong.</p>
