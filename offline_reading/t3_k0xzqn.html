        <p>Because they’ve effectively contained the virus and don’t let tinfoilers run riot. Plus, suicide has always been a large contributor to deaths due to their culture.</p>

        <p>you do realise they never had a lockdown in japan, right? no shut down of businesses, no stay at home orders, no bans on internal travel.</p>
<p>congratulating their effort to "contain the virus" when they didn't do anything approaching the kind of dystopian shit they're doing in europe, the states and canada, doesn't really make sense.</p>
<p>they did what everyone should have done, work from home if you can, but otherwise carry on like normal unless you're seriously ill. they wear masks a bit more than the west already, but it's already proven that mask mandates don't really affect the spread in any meaningful way, as it is that lockdowns don't either.</p>
<p>their general level of health could have also contributed hugely to the low infection mortality rate (even lower than the 99%+ experienced in other countries).</p>
<p>Japan has one of the highest life expectancies in the world, and one of the biggest percentages of elderly. which doesn't make sense in this case since in the west the average age of death from corona is higher than the average life expectancy in general.</p>
<p>you'd expect all these factors to result in many deaths for them, but it simply hasn't happened, similar in sweden and belarus. surprise surprise nobody ever talks about them!</p>
