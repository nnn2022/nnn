    <strong>There is light at the end of the tunnel</strong>
    <p><p>Call me naive or crazy, but maybe a little positivity is what is needed. Don't want to post something dramatic or negative - there is enough of that. </p>
<p>There is light at the end of the tunnel - this won't last forever. It can't. Better times are ahead.</p>
<p>The good side about this whole thing is how it has forced people to take account of their own perspectives and look at subjects they otherwise wouldn't. In no other time have so many old issues been brought to light to millions of people.</p>
<p>I believe people will emerge wiser. It will take years before it is seen - maybe even a full generation, but I believe that is what will happen.</p>
<p>You'll make it out of this. It really isn't the end of the world. Just hang tight, engage that inner sage and keep on keeping on. One day, COVID will be history, even if it doesn't seem that way now. </p>
<p>Let's put it this way, it cannot go on forever simply because people like you exist. There are many who don't speak up, but don't let that get to you. </p>
<p>Chin up, chest out, soldier on. </p>
<p>You're going to make it!</p></p>

        <p>Thanks for this. It’s starting to feel really bleak. I do truly believe that more and more are waking up. The people who just got the vaccine in order for things to go back to normal are starting to feel betrayed. Yes, some of them blame us. Yes, some of them are on social media rabidly calling for to suffer. But I believe more and more are seeing how the goal posts are ever changing, and it’s the fault of those in power.</p>

        <p>While it's hard to bring me "down", and I believe in always staying positive. With what's going on in other countries right now and a decent chunk of the US wanting the untainted dead, controlled, force vaccinated, or even locked away in camps, it really won't take much for things to get worse.</p>
<p>All the MSM needs to do is start talking about drastic measures other countries are taking, and the echo chamber of the Vaxed will jump on it, and that will then be used as public opinion being in support of drastic measures that this country would typically frown upon. </p>
<p>I think the US is in a really bad state right now, and unfortunately, I see things getting worse. </p>
<p>Now with that, being aware and considerate of what could be, doesn't need to ruin your day. I watch what's going on, but I don't let it mentally impact me. </p>
<p>Drink water, drive on!</p>

<p>You are sorrily mistaken. This pandemic has exacerbated existing mental health issues to the point where peoples who personality revolves around their stance on covid/measures/restrictions/vaccination status, etc. I've seen people otherwise very skeptical of all of this crack and do a 180 overnight. One person I know was highly skeptical to the point of asking and taking some of us to protest, one day wrote a long post about how she is going to be positive and that the government is right and then got vaccinated shortly after. Its like a cult, where people forfeit freedom for 'feeling' secure, all the while knowing it is not trully the case.</p>

        <p>You're right, the "pandemic" has exacerbated the mental health of some people. But it also uncovered what was already there all along - dysfunction.</p>
<p>The original point I was making is positivity is needed, not more infighting, fear, or "making the other person wrong", even if they are wrong and even if it is well-intentioned.</p>
<p>Are you tired of the negativity yet? There are other ways to look at it. Cynicism can be healthy, but when there is too much of it, it becomes toxic. </p>
<p>It's like taking too many aspirins for too long. It may mitigate some symptoms in the beginning, but it doesn't address the underlying cause and can be poisonous to your system.</p>
<p>You can be positive and disagree with others. That might be the key.</p>
