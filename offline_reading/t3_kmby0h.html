    <strong>Real stats for under 40s during covid. We are safe, no need to be in lockdown.</strong>
    <p><p>Statistic of the day......in England you are 3 times more likely to die from instant death sydrome (156 deaths per year on average) then die from covid if under 40 years old with no underlying health issues(50 deaths according nhs numbers).</p>
<p>To put that in perspective 20 people a year die from falling off their beds. So you are only two and a half times more likely to die from covid if under 40 with no underlying health issues then falling off your bed! </p>
<p>The numbers are not adding up boris...</p></p>

<p>This is why young kids; who are essentially at zero risk, have been forced to stay home and do "online" school and not see other children and sit in front of screens all day. At any other time period we would call that child abuse and irresponsible parenting but in the nEw nOrMaL this is selfless virtuous and sacrificial behavior to help society.</p>

        <p>The problem is those over 50 years of age where it suddenly jumps to a 5% mortality rate in those who get the virus.</p>
<p>We need to figure out why this virus is doing that. Actually I think we have: Vit. C, D and Min. Zinc deficient.</p>
<p>We need to start giving people in care homes those three things in moderately large amounts.</p>
<p>The problem is also that almost NO ONE is totally 'underlying health condition' free today.</p>
<p>Everyone has high blood pressure or minor overweight. One or the other. Both make CoVid-19 say "Imma gunna KEEELZ ya!"</p>

        <p>&rt; The problem is those over 50 years of age where it suddenly jumps to a 5% mortality rate in those who get the virus.</p>
<p>No. Absolutely not. For people aged 50-69 the IFR is .5%. Literally 10 times lower than what you just said. For 70+ it is 5.4%, but that's an entire 20 year age gap than what you just claimed. Another egregious spread of misinformation. Here's the CDC data in regards to the IFR: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html</p>
<p>&rt; Everyone has high blood pressure or minor overweight. One or the other. Both make CoVid-19 say "Imma gunna KEEELZ ya!"</p>
<p>Just no. Those are health conditions that the people who have them should absolutely address, but covid has a .2% IFR, as stated by the CDC. It's more than safe to assume that more than .2% of the world's population has high blood pressure or is slightly overweight and the vast majority of them are at a negligible risk of dying of covid. </p>
<p>This is the second thread I've seen you in spreading some fearmongering doomer nonsense. You provide nothing to back up your baseless claims. You're a doomer in disguise and you're sus.</p>

        <p>It's over 70's that it makes that jump. So it's estimated that 94% of deaths (by the CDC themselves) were in people with an average of 2.9 comorbidities, so yes lots of people have a minor one but I don't think it really poses an issue. You're right about the vitamins. It's estimated that over 80% of severe cases are in people who lack vitamin D, so that would help a lot.</p>
