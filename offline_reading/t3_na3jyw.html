    <strong>Kinda like riding a bike.</strong>
    <p><p>It's been a long road, this past year. This is a short story about myself but I think it signifies something greater. I work in the advertising and promotions industry, mostly with charities for benefit concerts and small sporting events. I think it's safe to say that my business essentially ceased to exist for this entire fiasco. I live in Florida, but most of my business is from Michigan and California, so even as my state was opened up I still had little income.</p>
<p>Well, over the past couple of weeks it's all come back. Charity concerts and sporting events are happening again. It used to be that I had steady work, but not a great deal of it. Now I am inundated with so much work I don't really even know what to do with myself or organize my work flow. I'll get it down, and I'll get it done. I always do. But I see these lockdown states opening up through this. Maybe not a lot but it shows that people are sick of this shit, and returning to human lives. I don't know how many people will be attending these concerts, but there is a lot more work for each one, so they sold great on advertising space.</p>
<p>I don't know what all this means. I'm just some guy who draws on his computer. But I really like what I see and I hope it spreads. Live music and sports is back, baby!!</p></p>
