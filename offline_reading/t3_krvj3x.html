    <strong>Did you know that many basic life insurance plans designed specifically for 50+ seniors still have no health questions regarding Covid?</strong>
    <p><p>So I work in the insurance industry, and one of the many odd things I've noticed is that senior whole life insurance plans ask health questions for everything including COPD, Diabetes, Cancer, Felonies, and much more. However, over a year since this Covid crap started and still most plans don't ask anything about wether or not you have Covid. If this was truly a deadly pandemic, life insurance companies would have added questions regarding Covid to their applications ASAP!!</p></p>
