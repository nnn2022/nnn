    <strong>A slight repost of a comment I made, but I want to give my opinion.</strong>
    <p><p>Not a total repost, but I don't leave long, opinionated or subjective comments on reddit. I'm a major introvert, but I get along with certain personality types very well, and make the best of it with personalities I don't care for. I'm not a fan of people, I like being alone, but I have no problem conversing with others in "real life", about any subject. </p>
<p>Repost with some additions of comment:</p>
<p>Think I've been banned from 3 subs or so. I'm sure there are wacky people in this sub, but my experience has been people just wanting to be left alone and not be told what to do when they feel the demand is unnecessary. Wouldn't have to be bribed or derided if the average Joe felt this was serious. I know if I saw clear evidence and knew someone that died, fer sure I wouldn't have to be convinced to get vaccinated. I don't know anyone that's died or anything beyond a diagnosis, I've seen no evidence of mass burials or body burning, no crammed hospitals. I dunno. I've been living normally since day one and I haven't even gotten a cold.</p>
<p>I've had the police called on me, I've been targeted and treated like pure shit by my employer, dirty looks from randoms, I've been treated poorly in my opinion, but I have principles and integrity that I'm not retreating from, and an attitude with people that don't treat me the way I treat them. Live and let live, or live and let die. Help those that can and want to be helped, plant seeds by giving others opinions and advice to not make the same mistakes I've made. </p>
<p>We vaccinated my son for the first year of his life, and he stayed sick on top of his congenital anomalies that continue to make his life very difficult, including an upcoming open heart surgery (more info in my first posts if you're interested). I've been on two life flights with my boy, we've spent a collective several months in hospitals, 2 major surgeries/11 operations where he's been put under, my head stays on a swivel and I'm alert 24/7 for anything that seems out of the ordinary with him. The slightest noise has me running to check on him, anything other than total silence has me pop out of a dead sleep to check on him or put him on my stomach and pat his back until he's okay or I fall back into a slumber. He frequently struggles with nightmares from his experiences and we still co-sleep with him at 3 years old (working on him independently sleeping now). He's almost died in my arms, blue, limp, rolling eyes,  extremely labored breathing. We stopped his vaccinations before this preposterous event commandeered the lives of most people on earth, and he hasn't had the sniffles since. Absolutely, if I felt it necessary and the evidence of this vaccination being safe and beneficial were there, we'd get vaccinated. I'm not anti medicine, science or vaccinations, I've lived it. I've lived in a hospital several times for weeks at a time. We have immune systems, and like any other part of our body, it needs exercise. You cannot isolate yourself or breathe in your germs all day and expect to stay healthy.</p>
<p>End of repost.</p>
<p>The media has created such a rift in our community since the evil orange photo bombed the circus. It wasn't perfect before, but it's become ridiculous since 2016. Everything has become political. I was very involved with politics until after the last election, when I realized it's all so tribal and absurd. My ideology, morality and opinions are mostly set. I will not force or attempt to convince someone to stop being what they are. I'm not changing for pretty much anyone unless I'm given a good reason. The people geeking out, full of anger and hatred for those with a different opinion, have never experienced the world outside of their bubble. I've worked in 4 different states, I've met so many people, from a group of Muslim women that I spent hours talking to, to crackheads, Christians, atheists, name it.. I've had 11 jobs currently from the Keystone XL to a gas station and now manufacturing. Oklahoma, Alabama, home state of Florida, Minnesota. There are so many different types of people. From zen to schizo. Not everyone is the same, and not everyone should be the same.</p>
<p>There's so much more to life than anger. Turn off the TV, stop believing everything you're told, go outside of your comfort zone and experience the real world. </p>
<p>I guess that's it, sorry for the ramble.</p></p>
