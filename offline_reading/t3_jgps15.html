    <strong>Virtual Events suck! (Comic Con. Anime Expo all at home)</strong>
    <p><p>Stuff like Comic Con at Home, Anime Expo lite or whatever fucking suck! Wheres the fun of actual conventions. Wheres the waiting outside ay 12am for a panel you know you wanna see. Surrounded by people like you who are into the same nerdy things as you. Wheres the funny cosplayers who crack jokes and do silly things during thier photos. I miss being part of a group. I miss having people like me. Now these virtual events are all "look at this thing we did" with no actual human emotiom or care going into it. Please someone reply.</p></p>

        <p>I agree, though I haven't been to events of that type. I used to go to my college's graduations each semester just for fun, and to other big events they had like water balloon fight.</p>
<p>I am sorry you are missing it too.</p>

        <p>After much internal debate I decided not to support any virtual event even if it was a band/org/etc that I liked. I love live music and had a summer of amazing shows planned, all of it cancelled of course. Some of these bands are now doing live streams and while I want to support them, I also want to take a stand against virtual events. These bands need to advocate for themselves. If they can make just as much money streaming, it will only push live music further and further into the memory hole.</p>

        <p>VR virtual events would be pretty cool if done right. Can bring back many aspects of the in-person experience. But a ways to go still until they would be quality enough and viable market.</p>

        <p>I know how you feel but for me it’s concerts. I was supposed to see BTS for the second time back in May, it was gonna be my second time seeing them since 2018 and it would have been my first ever stadium concert! It was gonna be massive. I remember when tickets went on sale in January, and BTS tickets are so hard to get because this group is so big that the tickets sell out insanely fast. I remember crying tears of joy with my parents that we finally got those tickets because we were waiting in the queue in what seemed like forever, plus weeks and days before the ticket sales I had anxiety over it. This concert meant everything to me. I’m so pissed off about it. Of course it’s not the boys’ fault. They had some online concerts which I enjoyed yes but seriously they’re not the same at all as being there live in person with the loud live music and singing and bass thumping through your whole body, and being there with all the thousands and thousands of fans cheering and screaming and singing along like there’s no tomorrow. And it’s also so much more exciting to see all the stage props and pyrotechnics in person too. I’m still so pissed off about this whole situation. </p>
<p>Also on the topic of anime conventions, I went to three of them in the past. 2014, 2015 and 2017. Those were so much fun and I would love to go again. Virtual events are no fun. It’s not the same at all. It’s honestly so dystopian.</p>

        <p>The worst part is that's none of the convention organizers are concerned about going out of business or doing more to make up lost time!</p>
<p>Their reactions are either blasé or hiding behind "health and safety" or downplayed. </p>
<p>All of these conventions are better off doing daily content via a youtube channel instead of having one time glorified livestreams.</p>
<p>The major anime convention in the dc area had one and I was straight up miserable during it. I was crying tears that how it was reduced and I was more productive cleaning my small room than watching the livestream.</p>
<p>I will not be attending any more virtual cons anymore. Theres no point without the atmosphere, and thankfully I've skipped out on magwest virtual con because a good portion of the attendees were virtue signaling about masks in a world where <strong>we need more escapism not constant reminders of dystopia</strong></p>
<p>People are not even caring or cant speak up or they will be shamed for being selfish for not sacrificing their livelhoods or lives for a dystopian replacement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEokVwyTl97TYF2DLodwxig">The only thing I was doing to cope was upload videos of my time during these cons, but I barely get an audience because con goers are too obsessed with the trump and biden show and BLM with every thing canceled.</a></p>
<p>Please speak up to your convention organizers. Demand them to do more next year to make up for this crap livestreams and tell them if theyre not offering more you will never attend another convention again.</p>

        <p>Never “gone” to one, and never will. I was huge on real events. I went to a lot of concerts, conventions etc. but if it’s going to be virtual bs I would rather save money for alcohol</p>
