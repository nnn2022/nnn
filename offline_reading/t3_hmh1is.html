        <p>Choice bits:</p>
<p>&rt; Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday he’s pumping the brakes on New Jersey’s gradual reopening from months of coronavirus lockdown orders as the state’s rate of transmission has risen above the key mark 1 for the first time in 10 weeks.</p>
<p>&rt; Murphy did not say he is rolling back any steps the Garden State has already taken, but he said “we’re not gonna be jumping the gun on a whole lot more opening-up steps right now.”</p>
<p>&rt; “We’re here right now,” the governor said during his latest coronavirus briefing in Trenton. “My guess is we’re gonna be here a bit.”</p>
<p>&rt; New Jersey is currently in Stage 2 of a multi-phrase reopening plan that Murphy presented in May. The governor added that officials will restart the process if they see the state’s transmission rate and daily positivity rate go down and stay down.</p>
<p>&rt; The governor said the transmission rate — the number of people one infected resident passes COVID-19 to — is one of the key figures officials look at to decide how to gradually peel back restrictions.</p>
<p>&rt; The rate had fallen to 0.70 in early June but has crept up in recent days. It now sits at 1.03, meaning every infected resident gives the virus to more than one other person.</p>
<p>&rt; “This is an early warning sign that, quite frankly, we need to do more,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; Officials said the reason for the rate rising is a mix of more indoor businesses reopening during Stage 2, as well as residents bringing the virus back after visiting other states with surging new cases.</p>
<p>&rt; They said there’s no evidence that mass outdoor activity at beaches, parks, or protests has led to major spikes in cases.</p>
<p>&rt; Murphy also said state officials are considering mandating that people in New Jersey wear face coverings while outdoors.</p>
<p>&rt; Currently, masks are required only when you’re indoors in a public place. But Murphy said during a television interview Sunday that there should be a national mandate to wear masks whenever someone is in public, indoors or outdoors.</p>
<p>&rt; “We’re constantly assessing and re-assessing the recommendations we have,” the governor said during Monday’s briefing. “The virus is a lot less lethal outdoors, but that does not mean it is not lethal.”</p>

        <p>I am not proud of my state right now. Shits got to end. “No evidence that mass outdoor activity at beaches, parks, or protests has led to major spikes in cases.” But by all means, continue to shut it down. Infuriating. It’s like reading tea leaves, might as well interpret the data based on the feeling of the moment. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, he’s talking about mandatory masks outdoors. You can’t even get more than a parking ticket in my neighborhood. Cops don’t enforce shit. How will they enforce that?</p>
