    <strong>Father going in moods, raging, silent treatment and calling me "selfish" and "uncaring"</strong>
    <p><p>My dad and I couldn't disagree more on politics and the pandemic. He is glued to the TV daily, shouting at the governments response not being severe enough, etc etc. You know the type. In the early days of the pandemic he would go in moods and then shout at me when I asked what was the matter, he would say I'm not "washing my hands" enough or "socially distancing", and after I didn't cave in on my views, after a few months, it eventually escalated into full arguments. After the first couple arguments I decided that COVID was an extremely emotional issue and a no-go zone - I refuse to discuss it because people can not see it logically, especially my dad. He has always struggled to deal with his emotions with people who disagree with him politically, but I managed to maintain a relationship with him through avoiding the topic entirely - I thought the same strategy would work with COVID.</p>
<p>At first, I thought this had worked, but it seems he couldn't fully repress his anger and it came out in funny ways. He has been "off" with me for months since we stopped talking about it, he seems to be somewhat resentful and his previous genuine affection for me all my life has dissipated. If I didn't make an effort to talk to him we could go weeks without properly talking, he is uninterested and aloof around me. He's not flat "in a mood" or nasty, but he just doesn't care about me like he used to, like he is deeply hurt and offended and is punishing me with aloofness. It's hard to explain but something was definitely off so I decided to talk to him about it.</p>
<p>After months of this I finally caved and said I felt alienated from him and I asked him what the matter was. I honestly didn't know what to expect but I needed to know. He said there is a "rift" between us regarding COVID that I refused to talk about and began to initiate the familiar "You're not doing enough" and "You're acting selfishly".</p>
<p>I managed to escape before it turned into a full blown argument to process my thoughts; went for a walk. On my return he was ignoring me. It didn't used to be like this, but 6 months later, I am trying to come to terms with the fact that this behaviour might not change. We have drifted apart, the subconscious genuine affection has gone. Before I believed that this problem would fade within a few months, if I simply avoided the topic entirely, but it seems to be much deeper than I ever anticipated. In the past, after arguments, things would go back to normal, but not any more, there is just a flat aloofness and bubbling pressure waiting to explode.</p>
<p>Not sure what to do, honestly I feel completely alienated and pretty torn up and can't talk to anyone about this except small pockets of sanity like this sub.</p></p>

        <p>This is honestly probably going on in homes across the globe. Tensions are so high, mental health is low, humans are going to suffer from long term PTSD. Also, with what the media escalation the psychological torture is a downright crime against humanity! They caused this divide and literally made everyone look at others as literal walking murderers. Its so horrible. I dont have any advice, but I completely understand. Someone should make a “no new normal emotional support” sub. A place where us lockdown skeptics can go to just complain and be heard by others who are like-minded. 
Hang in there.</p>

        <p>I'm assuming you can't move out because you're still a minor or for some other reason, and that this is not an option for you.</p>
<p>The toll on mental health due to covid restrictions is well documented and even <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html">acknowledged</a> by the CDC.  <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-future-brain/202003/how-covid-19-may-impact-mental-health">Anxiety disorders</a>, depression, and substance abuse have all increased. What I have not seen a study on, and I doubt that I ever will, is documentation of those who have been so freaked out over coronavirus that they themselves are mentally ill in a way that they are harming their familial relationships over a perceived lack of taking the virus "seriously" enough.  That study won't be done, or published, because it doesn't fit the narrative.</p>
<p>It sounds as if your dad is in full panic mode over coronavirus, and his obsession with televised accounts about it only fuel that obsession.  I seriously doubt you'll be able to change his view, so what I would do is try to change how he views you and your response to the mandates and recommendations.  </p>
<p>What I mean by that is to show him you take this seriously, even if you in reality think this has been blown out of proportion (which is my take, btw.)  Get one of those little bottles of hand sanitizer in a holder and clip it to your backpack.  Ask him if he has an extra mask before you go out even if you have one or don't wear one when you do things with friends. Wash your hands regularly, which is a good habit regardless of a "pandemic". Social distance when he's around.</p>
<p>That won't help the problem because it's feeding into his obsession over coronavirus, but it might alleviate some of the tensions between you two.   In my opinion much of this is "safety theater" anyway so you might have to play the part for a peaceful existence in his home.  We wear masks to "show" others we take this seriously when there's much evidence that masks do nothing and can even cause harm.  There are plexiglass dividers in stores, yet the cashier touches all of our items.  Bars close at 10pm to prevent the spread of covid, which makes no sense whatsoever.  It's theater, in my opinion, and I think the reason for it is to acclimate people to authority compliance.</p>
<p>But you live in his house and have to live by his rules.  So I suggest that you just accept this and show him that you're doing what he thinks you need to do to "take this seriously."  Trying to reason with an irrational person is an effort in futility and will surely worsen your relationship. I think your only option while living there is to play the role of a covid-measures compliant person, then vent to us if it gets to be too much.</p>

        <p>This. Also, when you start talking again, be a mirror to his fears. For example, if he makes an offhand comment about people not taking things seriously, say "yes, it's important to take this seriously". Recently, my Mom had an intervention for me because we were out together and she saw that I didn't wear my mask outside around other people.  She was prepared for a big argument about masks but I just told her, "I do wear a mask. I follow our state's guidelines. I don't want to get sick either" and she was visibly relieved. People like this just want their fears validated, so do that if it keeps the peace.</p>

        <p>The mirroring advice is great!  I think you're spot on about having their fears validated and their concerns recognized.</p>
<p>ETA: My daughter did that with me when the coronavirus fear campaign first started and I was terrified about all of her activities, afraid she would get it or give it to me or other relatives.  She said yes, she's following the guidelines and being very careful, and that really helped relieve my fear when I was still one of the people freaked out about this coronavirus nonsense.</p>

        <p>Well once it's all over, it really won't matter if they know you were lying because this whole thing will most likely be exposed as a sham and you'll be the one who didn't fall for the lie. </p>
<p>I lie to my parents about it too and I'm an adult who should be able to speak my mind, but I don't because it makes them "feel" better.  They'll have a family dinner at a restaurant or even at home, and they'll be wearing masks which I think is ridiculous to do while sitting at the dinner table.  But we all wear ours too until one of our parents takes their mask off first - then ours all come off quickly after! </p>
<p>I think in time more and more people will realize this whole thing has been a scam to acclimate western people to authoritarian mandates like they have in China.  As freaked out as I was when this whole thing started, it didn't take long to see what was really going on (in my opinion.)  I suspect that by the time your family realizes you were lying, they'll probably be the ones feeling foolish for being blind believers in all the propaganda.</p>

        <p>I really hope so! I think it depends on how it ends. If it's due to a vaccine, then that wouldn't require anyone to question what they were told. Though if we don't get a vaccine anytime soon, and places either keep going in and out of lockdown or states are forced to open (via lawsuits most likely), that would compel more people to question things.</p>

        <p>Holy shit, OP, I'm so sorry. Your dad sounds like he's been literally brainwashed by 'rona trauma based mind control.</p>
<p>I know exactly where you're coming from. Your dad actually sounds like my mom, only with kind of depressive paranoia instead of seething, passive aggressive rage. Does he have any preexisting psychological issues that could compound on this shit?</p>

<p>He was physically abused as a child and I think his coping mechanism was passive aggression. He has always been <em>impossible</em> to reason with and extremely sensitive to the slightest criticism. If he feels criticized, he goes from 0-10 in an instant with eyes bulging out of head explosive anger. He also has extremely strongly held views and positions on anything remotely political, and anyone who disagrees with him is usually "morally deficient" or "selfish".</p>

        <p>Thanks, sister.
I haven't really tried to pick her brain about what's going on, but I strongly suspect that the "granny murderer" propaganda worked its evil magic on her something fierce, since her own mom is in the age for it to be actually kinda dangerous to her. But then again, she's REALLY hardy for a little old lady.</p>
<p>That and my mom may very well have some kind of diagnosed anxiety disorder too, IDK.</p>

        <p>He has allowed his fear to absorb him. Since you aren't afraid, he cannot relate to you. It can help to give him an outlet to talk to you about how he feels, and for you to truly listen to him. Just being listened to can help. Doing so does not obligate you to take on his suffering, but he doesn't have to do so in isolation.</p>

        <p>I really don't understand people. How old are you? Do you live with him? If it was my dad, I would argue with him. Destroy him. Make him feel like an idiot and then advise him he doesn't have to stay that way. And that if he continues to behave like a fucking idiot child that he can let me know when he is gonna stop doing that or good fucking bye. But I'm in my 30's living on my own.</p>

        <p>My dad isn't like this. He goes from 0 to 10 very fast, and gets extremely angry and volatile when he feels criticized. There is absolutely no reasoning with him. In combination with this, he has extremely strongly held political beliefs (which extends to this virus). Anyone who disagrees with him politically is in some way "morally deficient" or "selfish", and this is infuriating to debate against, combined with the aggressive shouting.</p>

        <p>Have you tried sitting down with him and going over the data? If that doesn't work, I would just mimic him. I KNOW this sounds really bad, lol. But, is he physically capable of hurting you? Are you worried about that? I were you, I would behave exactly like him. If that's the example he wants to set, show him what that really is and what that does. If it was me, I would build up the argument all the way to where it actually seems to him like the only thing that will stop you from persisting that he is absolutely, 100 percent wrong and you are forcing him to come to terms with it and admit it right now is a physical confrontation. Again, if you can't actually be intimidating this won't work. But people sometimes don't see the implications of their behavior until it's way to late, (covid response, if Biden wins, for a perfect example) and manufacturing a response that's similar to his might make him understand just how ridiculous it is to behave like that. What your dad is doing, is a form of manipulation. He is trying to act like he doesn't care about you because he thinks that if he pushes this that far you will be guilted into changing your mind. Don't let anybody do that too you. Family is more important than fake political virus bullshit. If he doesn't have the wherewithal to know that and treats you differently solely for you perspective on this one issue, I wouldn't mind pushing back and letting him know exactly how he is behaving by virtue of my own behaviors.</p>
