    <strong>Evidence that no one who has had covid should bother with the shot, and that the shot is absolutely inferior to naturally derived antibodies. Third dose is effectively useless, except to Pfizer profits</strong>
    <p><p>From this article:  https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/delta-infections-among-vaccinated-likely-contagious-lambda-variant-shows-vaccine-2021-08-02/</p>
<p>which links this study:  https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.29.454333v1</p>
<p>And the key takeaway:<br>
&rt;They note that in COVID-19 survivors, the immune system's antibodies evolve during the first year, becoming more potent and better able to resist new variants. In 32 volunteers who never had COVID-19, they found that antibodies induced by mRNA vaccines did evolve between the first and second shots. But five months later, vaccine-induced antibodies were "equivalent" to those seen after the second dose, with "little measurable improvement" in the antibodies' ability to neutralize a broad variety of new variants, said coauthor Michel Nussenzweig. Therefore, he said, giving those individuals a third dose of the same vaccine would likely result in higher levels of antibodies that remain less effective against variants.</p></p>
