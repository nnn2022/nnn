    <strong>Any recommendations on a great podcast or news video outlet that isn't tying all of their stories to the pandemic or blaming everything on Covid-19?</strong>
    <p><p>Regardless of what you think of the pandemic or the virus, constantly hearing nearly everything related to it, case numbers, blaming me for trying to live outside of it, or advice for living out the new normal is driving me nuts.</p>
<p>I miss human interest stories. I miss seeing what else is actually going on in the whole world and it's a huge place. There has to be something that isn't related to Covid. I used to love talk radio but I cannot get through a program without coronavirus being blamed for something we can't have. I want some creativity ad good story telling. The new normal is lazy.</p>
<p>Have a recommendation for a news site (political or not), podcast (I love history, true crime, and economics), or a YouTube channel that largely ignores everything Covid? I'd be willing to try one that talked about lockdowns if it actually offered tangible advice on how to avoid them, fight back against them, or how to make a life that could nearly ignore them as a method of resistance.</p></p>
