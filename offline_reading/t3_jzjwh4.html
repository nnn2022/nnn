        <p>Just if someone wondering, police will put that on your head to 'protect' them from you. Amnesty international rised the questions, as this greatly reduce the breathing( the front is plastic), but they will use it anyway..</p>

        <p>I've gone out of my way to defend the police through, well, most everything.  I have worked with them closely and consider many friends, they genuinely work for the best for everyone.</p>
<p>There damn well better come a time when police look at these acts they're being told to perform and say "this is bullshit, no fucking way."  They have families, they need jobs, most people can't just quit and still pay rent or even eat, but there is still a line that must not be crossed.</p>

        <p>\&rt;  It said they had "provided a high degree of reassurance to officers and staff".</p>
<p>As long as the pigs are reassured. WTF? So, are ppl in Ireland known to be biting and trying to eat poor officers who only try to help them?</p>
<p>If Irish public accepts whatever this depersonalization tool is ,they could just officially declare slavery to get it over it. Peasants couldn't care less anyhow. Try to put this on American Redneck or on Russian and you'll see what happens.</p>

        <p>These are not police officers. They are hardened thugs working to oppress society. History tells us what happens to the front line once oligarchy is established. It doesn’t go good for you. After they’ve used you to get rid of us... they’ll turn their attention to you and your families. Their blood lust is unrelenting. The elite don’t like loose ends and they are after depopulation. The new world order most certainly won’t include any police force from today. No. They already have them ready and waiting. They’re underground right now waiting to come up. They’ll be putting their private sheriffs in and unless your that kinda ‘blue blood’ you’re not gonna be making the recruitment cut. They won’t need police forces because they’re be no people left to ‘protect’. There will be no city streets to patrol. The few that are left won’t be hard to control because they’ll be broken in chains and sick from the vaccine. There will be no freedoms so why do you need to a police force? The elite don’t need police, they don’t like police, that’s why they want to defund you. You are capable of free thought and you can expertly use a gun. They’ll kill you too. Don’t kid yourself. </p>
<p>Please don’t forget what you became an officer for. It was to PROTECT PEOPLE! Not kill them and do the elites dirty work. Remember you get ONE LIFE. That’s it. Don’t spend it fulfilling someone else’s evil deeds. Protect the people not a fucking agenda. It’s only a paycheque.</p>
