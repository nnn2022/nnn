    <strong>Why are people so zealous about OTHERS taking the vaccine when natural immunity exists?</strong>
    <p><p>If the goal of the vaccines is to save lives (accomplished by minimizing the risk of onward spread through reducing the severity of symptoms, as well as individual protection against severe cases), why wouldn't naturally-developed immunity be just as lauded?</p>
<p>It's this question that shows me there is a lot more than "saving grandma and saving the vulnerable. " But is it really as simple as they are angry that you aren't following the MSM rules? Is it so far spun that having an opinion/concern immediately brands you politically, which completely distracts from logic and people seeing anything else (i.e "you're a dumb libtard," "you're a racist conservative" etc.)?</p>
<hr>
<p>It feels like there is a complete lack of simple reasoning when it comes to the vaccine zealots:</p>
<p>1) It has been documented repeatedly that getting that vax does not stop you from getting the virus. </p>
<p>2) The initial trials showed a clear reduction of covid symptoms and severity...one may presume that this would be asymptomatic. </p>
<p>3) Therefore, either the vaccine is going to work in an overwhelming majority of those who get it (as defined by minimal sickness) and everything should quickly return to normal...OR asymptomatic spread is not a problem (because vaxxed individuals will still get the virus, but have reduced/no symptoms..otherwise what was the point of getting vaxxed, to provide personal protection? If so, how is that not ENTIRELY understood to be a personal decision?).  </p>
<p>4) If asymptomatic spread is not a problem, then why would an otherwise healthy individual have any reason to get this vaccine? (They wouldn't be spreading it,  aren't affected by getting it, and will develop natural immunity.)</p>
<hr>
<p>To live is to risk death. Everyday people take calculated risks when going about their lives, and this virus should be treated no differently. If you believe taking a vaccine will provide protection against severe symptoms, do it! If you are worried about the possible short or long terms effects, don't take it! (And if you say "well it's to protect others," see the numerical flow chart above).</p>
<p>Some people are afraid of flying in aircrafts, so they drive hours and hours overland when traveling; they are not condemned nor segregated by society, so what makes taking the vaccine so special..?</p></p>

        <p>That is the one that makes the most sense to me. But also the most frustrating because it shows that many people are not capable of genuine reflection in their lives. Growing up we always heard: "honesty is the only policy."</p>
<p>If you can't be honest with yourself, who can you be honest with?</p>

        <p>Definitely agree that there is a lack of critical thinking. And to add to that, I think more recently (maybe the last 20 years) there has been a weird distortion of what critical thinking is, so many people are fully convinced that they ARE finding solutions through reason. </p>
<p>And with the way childhood education is delivered (everyone wins, awards for literally anything), and the way universities mainly drive one school of thought, there leaves little room for the development of critical thinking</p>

        <p>Yeah. When I got that first test I wanted to show it around and enjoy its benefits. Now I realize it was a psychological effect. Having paid a cost (i.e. the risk), I wanted the payout to be the maximum, and didn't want people who did not pay that cost to just free-ride without paying the cost. I suppose that's human nature. As the evil ones, you don't have to make everyone fall in line, you make people bully each others into submission.</p>

        <p>I can totally understand that people might act erratically  when stressed out. But when the base of that stress (likely the fear of death/fear of family member death) has been shown to be unwarranted for nearly every single person, for more than a full year at that, I would hope that people would start to think rationally and move on. </p>

        <p>And even if it didn't, anyone that afraid Covid would have likely taken the vaccine for themselves. So why does it matter if the next person doesn't take the vaccine, if they are, in their mind, protected?</p>
<p>Of course, the vaccine doesn't stop transmission, which makes that a moot point, so take it as a hypothetical question.</p>

        <p>I really think there’s a lot of people who took it out of fear and social pressures even though they were a bit hesitant, and now want others who are adamant about not taking it to also feel their same anxieties. If you’re healthy, why fix what isn’t broken.</p>

        <p>Yeah at least with the other vaccine they have the “well there are some people who are unable to get the vaccine due to health problems or age” argument </p>
<p>And yet that somehow isn’t the case for a mostly untested vaccine? For the first time in medical history literally EVERYONE has to be treated to a vaccine, lmao. Even the non-vulnerable.</p>

<p>A lot of the people I've talked to in person, think at least that something doesn't add up. The most differences are within what levels of mischief they consider the establishment capable of.</p>

        <p>Yea, the euthanization thing is way too far. Like it would be disadvantageous for the elite of the elite: they need people to work and perform whatever various jobs in their companies, buy their products, build/make the things they use/want. Killing all those people would make their lives significantly harder</p>

        <p>The Lancet has published results of 2 studies talking about this; one of Denmark with nearly the entire nation’s test results being evaluated, and one from Qatar.  Nature dot com has a really good article that sort of surveys several studies, including the 2 aforementioned.  </p>
<p>One highlight:
“These studies provide evidence for strong protection from reinfection in seropositive individuals during the first few months after infection (at levels similar to the protection seen after vaccination).”</p>
<p>Another highlight:
“Currently licensed vaccines have shown efficacies of up to 95% in preventing laboratory-confirmed infection over the first few months after vaccination61,62,63, a level of protection that is not significantly different to the 89–95% protection that has been estimated following natural infection53,54”.

        <p>Yes, it’s the point I’m trying to make, in defiance of the dominant narrative (spouted mostly by pinheads)that has erased infection-induced immunity from the discussion of herd/population immunity.</p>
<p>Edit: also your wording was not confusing, just not accurate imho.  I don’t believe in science.  Science is not to be believed.  What I try to do is understand it.  Science is to be understood and or refuted through experimentation.</p>

        <p>Because getting immunity from a vaccination is better than getting immunity from the virus itself. Less risk. In a perfect world we would prioritize vaccinating those who haven't had Covid but that would introduce a difficult logistical hurdle built on imperfect data, so people are getting vaccinated voluntarily. Presumably the highest risk populations have a higher demand to be vaccinated so it will sort itself out.</p>
<p>Plus "get vaccinated" is a very simple message that is very easy to measure</p>

        <p>"Because getting immunity from a vaccination is better than getting immunity from the virus itself. Less risk."</p>
<p>I think it is a stretch to call the vaccine less risky for young, healthy individuals. I haven't looked too in depth at the reported values, (and maybe you could provide any sources you have), but I would be very surprised if adverse effects from covid are any magnitude greater than adverse effects from the vaccine.</p>
<p>Regarding the actual virus, the risk of severe illness or death in that demographic is remarkably low. And by young, I'm not even referring to just children. According to research from Duke University (using CDC data), people under the age of 50 have are 7 times more likely to die from anything than from covid. Being in that demographic, why would I take a vaccine for something that poses absolutely no problem for me? And if the answer to that is something along the lines of "protecting others"...I would ask you to read my number flow chart in the original post and help me to understand the logic. </p>
<p>"Plus "get vaccinated" is a very simple message that is very easy to measure."</p>
<p>Definitely agree that it is easier to keep track of, but does the difficulty of tracking who has immunity justify mandates of the vaccine?</p>

<p>" Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 led to observed protection against reinfection estimated to be approximately 80% after 6 months. However, the observed low natural immunity in people aged 65 years and older underlines the need to vaccinate previously infected individuals, in particular in this age group."</p>
<p>It's all about statistics. You have to measure the different risks associated with treatment vs non-treatment and what the chances are of death or long term chronic conditions.</p>
<p>As for whether vaccinated people are asymptomatic spreaders, the research just isn't clear. There are studies ongoing in England, Brazil in India.</p>

        <p>The elevated risk of reinfection for elderly population shouldn't be surprising: their immune systems are not as strong or robust as younger individuals, which is why making a calculated risk assessment (particularly in that age group) should be advocated, perhaps encouraged? But in the end still a decision the individual should make..that's just my current position.</p>
<p>And I FULLY agree that "it's all about statistics." Which is precisely why younger and healthy individuals need not be compelled to take a vaccine which does little to actually help them.</p>

        <p>Yes I will get it every 6 months because are you going to live like this for the rest of your life with something with over a 99.99% survival rate? If you want to weaken your immune system by continuing to wear a mask forever and never get colds or flu you can do that but let the rest of us live our lives normally. There are far more things that will kill you than this fake overblown plandemic. The real pandemic is the "vaccines" that could potentially kill millions.</p>

        <p>This is from a government <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-19">website</a>from some shithole country, but maybe it qualifies for “not back alley” for you.  </p>
<p>From the “at a glance” section top of article, published 01.26.21:</p>
<p>“The immune systems of more than 95% of people who recovered from COVID-19 had durable memories of the virus up to eight months after infection.</p>
<p>“The results provide hope that people receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will develop similar lasting immune memories after vaccination.”</p>
<p>I have more if the NIH website isn’t legit for you- maybe The Lancet qualifies?</p>

        <p>The problem is that your decision not to get vaccinated yourself impacts on others. If you need hospital treatment for Covid that impacts on the healthcare system. If you are sick with Covid you can be an incubator for new variants. If you are asymptomatic and untested you can spread Covid to others. It’s cultural, in part. Some people think it’s important to take care of others, and some people don’t.</p>

<p>"The flu isn't near as dangerous as Covid". Correct. It's far more dangerous and has taken millions of lives over the decades. Covid has a LONG way to go to catch up to the flu, forget pneumonia or tuberculosis.</p>

        <p>You would agree that virtually all actions affect others right? </p>
<p>I understand your concerns regarding people being passing the virus onto others. It's a concern society has shared with many previous viruses and bacteria, so this is somewhere we can agree.
However, my question was in regards to vaxxed people vs people who've acquired natural immunity. Do you hold them in the same regard? Do you find that each category "takes care of others" as you mentioned?</p>
<p>And regarding your comment on asymptomatic spread, I would then refer you back to the logic chart I wrote. Because vaxxed people can also catch the virus, then they too could be asymptomatic and spread the virus to others if not tested, as you wrote. So then what was the incentive to get it? And would this mean you would promote testing for covid infection in perpetuity?</p>

        <p>No. You do not understand my concerns at all. You are still under the impression that this virus is similar to viruses humanity has encountered before. It isn’t. What worked for other viruses doesn’t work for this one. And, no. Catching Covid isn’t public spirited. It’s the opposite of public spirited. People who catch Covid are incubators for potential new variants. On average they will spread it to three other people, unless they are tested at the start of the infection and self isolate while still asymptomatic. When they recover they may or may not have some immunity for a few months, but that’s no help to anyone else. They may have long term symptoms that require further medical help that is a drain on the health services. At this point, anyone living in the US or the U.K. knows very well how to avoid Covid and has no excuse for catching it.</p>

        <p>"What worked for other viruses doesn’t work for this one."</p>
<p>Well firstly, I don't find the morbidity of covid (from studies I've read ~3-4x higher than the flu) all that new or cause for panic, considering other respiratory infections are far more deadly. This a respiratory virus (which is not new), that is contagious via aerosol droplets (which is not new), and many people infected show mild or little symptoms (which is not new),  etc. There is not much about the actual corona virus that has not been seen before.</p>
<p>"When they recover they may or may not have some immunity for a few months, but that’s no help to anyone else"</p>
<p>And this is the crux of it all. If immunity is "no help to anyone else," why are people getting vaxxed? And as I mentioned in the original post, if it provides personal protection, why should that not be a personal choice? </p>
<p>"They may have long term symptoms that require further medical help that is a drain on the health services."</p>
<p>Ok. But you wouldn't condemn chronic illnesses, would you? You wouldn't condemn other long term diseases/injuries/disorders that require long term care as a drain on the health system would you? If someone has long term negative side effects from covid and needs frequent treatment, that is unfortunate, but that's life. Every person in my circle that's had it never needed to seek treatment, and there's no reason to suspect that they will need it in the future. I can't imagine I'm unique in that way.</p>
<p>"At this point, anyone living in the US or the U.K. knows very well how to avoid Covid and has no excuse for catching it."</p>
<p>But this is also poor logic. We all know how to avoid breaking a bone, drowning, stepping in dog shit, starvation...whatever it may be...it doesn't mean accidents and unfortunate things happen. I know how to avoid pulling a muscle, but that didn't stop me from tweaking my back in a game of basketball this week. Come on, you can be serious with that statement...unless you expect people to avoid other humans indefinitely and/or test themselves extremely frequently to give a sense of safety</p>

        <p>This person is slinging shit against the wall. How can you know anything about this virus? It's never even been isolated that's why the "vaccine" contains synthetic genetic sequences because they had to "guess" at what the genetic code is for the so called "virus" because they don't actually have one they can study.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Most people fight Covid off. Many have few or no symptoms at all. The mystery is why some people get so sick and why some have long term problems. The people who get very sick tend to be older and/or have underlying health issues. The people who suffer long term complications, not so much. That’s less predictable.</p>

        <p>A new study says that natural immunity could last year's or even decades, for all we know it could be permanent. Don't give me that "U can't be 100% sure" Pascals wager bullshit, in life you can't be 100% sure of anything, so you just have to be reasonable and not assume there's risk without evidence</p>
