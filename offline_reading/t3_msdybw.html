    <strong>A Quick rant on the scamdemic</strong>
    <p><p>This might come across as contentious, but I believe the profound measures that taking place are inhumane and quite frankly inequitable. Inherent lockdowns have proven to be insufficient as statistics have shown and precipitously arduous or rather tiring. I’ve come to the consensus that this tyranny (which has been deliberately orchestrated) is about subjugation and suppression for society especially for the middle class, and sovereignty for the globalists, politicians and techno-feudalism individuals (such as Bill Gates, Elon Musk etc.) If you continue to acquiesce to their measures you will continue to lose your human rights and you continue to live your life in austerity. These heinous/despicable restrictions have led to unemployment, bankruptcy, suicides, starvation, homelessness, drug overdose, domestic abuse, child abuse, eating disorders, delayed medical treatment and distortion of mental health. The incentive for these individuals is to implement the great reset where the G7 nations will constitute their own cryptocurrency through the central banks (starting in 2022) in order to eradicate the use of printing money in the foreseeable future, (don’t believe? Type why central banks want to launch digital currency on YouTube) Covid is just a trojan horse of what’s to come. (and no it’s not a conspiracy it’s transpiring as we speak but the 🐑 won’t understand until it’s to late🤷🏾‍♂️.) In addition to this, globalists are trying to implement a vaccine passport (which I’m firmly AGAINST cough cough “totalitarianism”) as they believe it will be imperative for social gatherings or going to a sporting event. Ask yourself this, is this really about health? In the words of Eric Schmidt “Everyone at davos will be fine” 😂😂</p>
<p>Here are my favourite quotes about George Orwell that are pertinent in this current age.</p>
<p>“The people will not revolt. They will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what’s happening” </p>
<p>“If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever.”</p></p>

        <p>It's way more complicated then a human-person even a genius like Bill of the Gates could ever grasp. Why are you trying? It's pretty cringe-inducing to read about the globalists pushing vaccine passports for sporting events through fake pandemic.</p>
<p>But the crypto-currency as you call it is very likely. Except you'll be the currency. The thing about the Antichrist and the 666 is true as it turns out. Not that the ancients predicted it, the Elites just think it's funny to implement it.</p>
