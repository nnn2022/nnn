    <strong>I can't believe that the few people I know at work who were against the jab, are now actually going to get it...</strong>
    <p><p>You know what? If I could leave my amazon warehouse job, I would.....Unfortunately I need the money.....</p>
<p>I'm so sick of the ignorant fucking people who already got their vaccine and still want to wear their masks. I feel like I'm living in an alien world. Everything has no common sense anymore. It's driving me crazy...</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there's still a good hand of people who I know personally who aren't getting the jab. so thank god for that sanity. But Jesus Christ how long is this bullshit going to go on!? This is like a bad dream that just won't end!</p></p>

        <p>I think we're gonna start seeing ALOT of people who said they wouldn't get the vaccine getting it, alot of my friends have only just started being offered it - I think they were just saying it for the sake of it but when push comes to shove they're gonna crumble.</p>

        <p>I hated my coworkers before Covid and I still hate them today. When this all started happening they all thought this wasn't real. Eventually my company said we could work remotely during it (the only plus for me in all this lol) if we wanted to. Many chose to stay in the office going on like nothing was happening. We now all are all required back to work and ALL of them got the vaccination. Me? I do think Covid is real (although a lot of things related to it I question...) however I cannot, and will not get the vaccination for as long as I can help it.</p>

        <p>As a high net worth individual, I will never get this vaccination.  I have spoken with private jet brokers who have assured me that there is no plans for vaccine requirement for private charters even if commercial carriers implement one.  I have no interest in a vaccine for flu2.0.  Social pressure is a non issue for me - not due to a lack of existence but due to a lack of care.  I hope everyone is able to retain their ability to choose for themselves and I donâ€™t think negatively of those who have chosen to vaccinate - if I was elderly or had an underlying health issue or a familial history of disease I would absolutely choose the vaccination.</p>

        <p>Problem is, we've heard too many fragile people getting it, and it just finishes them off sooner. Im not avoiding it for some political stance. Im avoiding it because it sounds dangerous as fuck. I have heart disease in my bloodline, while having zero issues at 43 so far, Im not adding blood clots to my body on purpose after Ive gone all this time with zero alcohol, cigs, or drugs. If it can give one person blood clots, it can give anyone clots. I'll take my chances with my robust immune system thanks. My best friend got it, she always gets sick. She battled with it for a month, but totally recovered with no lasting side effects. If her shit immune system can do that, I'll trust mine.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m not for or against it.  Iâ€™m an advocate for choice.  My personal choice is to not get it.  My wife has chosen to not get it as well.  But again, if I had other health issues I would take a serious look at getting it, which is not to say that you should.</p>

        <p>I will simply say the bulk donâ€™t have any interest in getting it for elitist reasons which likely will come across as offensive.  That said I know 4-5 people who have gotten it due to other medical issues (previous heart attacks and diabetes and maybe additional issues unknown to me).</p>

Feeling like I have to choose between my mental health and physical health really sucks.

        <p>I donâ€™t wear a mask anywhere but work. But unfortunately thatâ€™s a huge portion of my time. We are asked to submit information to corporate verifying our date of vaccination. And Iâ€™ve basically been told Iâ€™ve been too vocal about it to get away with lying. And on the vaccination sheet it says that we could be asked to provide proof in the future. Iâ€™ve been at my job a really long time and really donâ€™t want to leave.</p>

        <p>Well....then I guess the only helpful advice I can give is A. continue to wear a mask. Or B. Make a fake Vaccination card or some shit. But you gotta ask yourself....is putting an unknown variant in your body that could potently do more harm than good, something you're willing to do because peer preassure?</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm in the same boat as you, except I don't know what job you work at. But I work in a Amazon warehouse that's pretty small, so I know a decent amount of people there. There're a handful of us never getting the jab, so my advice is just don't talk to people about it.</p>
<p>Trust me I understand leaving a good job is hard....but sometimes you gotta do what you got to do. You don't have to up and leave now, but if I were you, I'd starting looking for better opportunities, and then when things get too hectic, you have a backup plan.</p>

        <p>Maybe. Once those companies will ask for medical proof. And most people aren't even listening the CDC anyways. Most people are already vaccinated, yet they're still wearing their mask regardless of what the CDC says. </p>
