    <strong>Freedom</strong>
    <p><p>Alright, so I have written about this before, but I just thought I should bring it up again because of what I've been hearing. I don't know how true this is, or how much I believe this, but what I have heard is that some places are going back to normal because of the vaccine. If this is true, of course I want the old normal back and I think everyone here does. </p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>I'm still not satisfied. If we get our rights back, it has got to be because we take them back. Not because they are given back. The tyrants never had the authority to take them in the first place, so why should they be the ones to give them back? We need to take them back on our own terms, otherwise they haven't learned anything. They haven't learned that they can't just do this to their people. If we get our rights back because they are given back, that sets a precedent that the people in power can just take our rights whenever they please, and give them back whenever they please and that's not something we can let happen. If we get our rights back, it needs to be because we take them back, not because the government gives them back. As I said, they were never theirs to take anyway. If they would just say "here are your rights back!" that's unacceptable. It means that they could just take them again whenever they feel like it and cover it with "for the greater good." I've heard things like "lockdowns for the climate" and crap like that. </p>
<p>Also, if we don't win against this, that will mean that society, in this generation especially, would rather give up their rights completely for a false sense of safety and expect everyone to comply to them. It will mean that the future of our rights and freedom is conditional; we can have it as long as our overlords let us have it. This is just something that has really been bothering me because I'm scared for the future.</p></p>

        <p>Before 2020, I’d thought that americans would not have taken this. But we did. All they had to do was call us racist and we went home :(. We tried to protest initially) Now they know they can control us with the magic word.</p>

        <p>At this point they can call me a racist all they want. It's just a word they throw around and it doesn't hurt me at all. Especially since those idiots don't even know what actual racism is. So I'll keep mouthing off and fighting it. I don't give a shit anymore. We can be scared of some stupid buzzword.</p>

        <p>What’s funny to me is the people most likely to throw that word around in unwarranted situations are young white kids riddled with white guilt who are projecting all that “you need to be sorry because you were born white” bullshit they swallowed the past year.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of people are coming to this understanding that if you want your freedom and rights, you actually have to actively be willing to fight for it because otherwise you aren’t going to get it. We’ve been slowly sacrificing freedom for convenience and a false sense of safety for over a century now. What we put up with – the government knowing everything about you and restricting people’s movements so heavily, the people a generation ago wouldn’t have put up with. Though, most people are pretty weak minded, otherwise we never would have been able to get to this point. It's how every tyranny throughout history has happened, because not enough people are willing to fight to be free.</p>
<p>It’s hard and will take a lot of work and will require a lifelong battle. Unfortunately even among the liberty minded people that see through the propaganda, there is a relatively small minority that would be willing to do whatever it takes so to speak to defend others beyond just themselves for the next generation.</p>

        <p>I totally feel the same way. Not suicidal but not wanting to live in a world like this; hopeless, helpless, in a constant state of disgust for the majority of the human race. It feels like there are so few people who care about living life anymore so they just exist and expect everyone else to do the same, or else you're "weird", "crazy", a "conspiracy theorist", or all three. There are just so few sane people out there anymore. It reminds me of two quotes. The first one is "Pardon my sanity in a world insane."  and the second one is "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him." But if you're thinking about suicide, I know how much you feel like you don't want to live in this world anymore, but if anything should keep you here, it's the fact that offing yourself is just taking away one more sane person from this world, and we need all the sane people we can get. The only thing that keeps me here is the (maybe false) hope that it just has to get better than this and the fact that I am one of the few people still fighting to save our rights.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your msg.  I’m sticking around a little longer, even if it’s only just existing.  I just have lost any hope for humanity at this point.<br>
I really like your two quotes, they make a lot of sense.<br>
Hanging on by false hopes is what is keeping me around for now.  Once it gets extremely worse in our jacked up world or my health gets unbearable I will do the right thing for myself and finally have my peace mentally and physically. 
I do a fantastic job at being thorn in people’s ass at times, so my ride is not over yet...I still have to keep my husband on his toes. 😉
Hope you enjoy the rest of your Sunday, be well.</p>
