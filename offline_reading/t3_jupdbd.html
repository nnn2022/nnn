    <strong>Coronavirus - The Latest Apocalypse Cult</strong>
    <p><p>All through history, man has gone through various "it's the end of the world" phases. As he has sought to explain the world around him, with his limited knowledge and vision, he has attached significance to various signs given him by the forces of nature. Some of these signs, of course, are frightening and beyond his powers to understand or control.</p>
<p>To "assist" in this, the powers that be will always provide "a way out of the end times", where certain rituals must be followed to save us all. <em>And of course, to give them power.</em></p>
<p>- In early nomadic and agricultural societies, failure of hunts and crops was seen as a sign of the gods' anger. The proto-priestly classes prescribed various rituals to appease the gods, like the sacrifice of animals. When this failed, the logical next step was to sacrifice <em>other humans</em> - chosen of course, by the priestly class. Never knowing who will be the next to have his still-beating heart torn out on an altar, or be strangled and thrown into a bog is, of course, a fantastic means of social control...</p>
<p>- As we progressed, we moved on to the concept of disease, famine, and natural disasters being seen as "God's punishment for our sins", and the church was right there with the solution - give us money to buy your salvation. If that doesn't work, then the problem must be "heretics", or "witches", or "the evil eye". So the powers that be burned hundreds of thousands at the stake and fought bloody religious wars to keep the peasants ignorant and docile - and in their doctrinal pens. A small price to pay to be "saved from God's wrath"...</p>
<p>- In modern times, beginning with the French Revolution and carrying on in various forms into today, we have set up "virtue" as our God. Virtue, of course, being determined by whomever is in charge at the time. The Cult of the Supreme Being, Bolshevism, Nazism, Maoism, "Social Justice" - it doesn't matter what we call it, the script is always the same: "These are extraordinary times, Citizen. There are dark forces against us. They will not see our way is the virtuous one - we must root them out and destroy them - War to the Knife!!!"</p>
<p>Now the latest iteration of this lesson in human nature plays out as the "War Against The Virus". </p>
<p>We see it taking the usual path - "education", followed by "persuasion", followed by propaganda, followed by deceit, followed by framing dissenters and outliers as "conspiracy theorists", "Grandma-Killers", "Plague Rats", etc, etc etc. Only the technology has changed.</p>
<p>We are very close to entering the "Burn the Heretics!" phase -with the NWO, health bureaucrats, and corrupt politicians taking the place of shamans, bishops, and revolutionary strongmen.</p></p>

        <p>The biggest change is technology allowing a larger zone of influence to those who wish to enslave us.</p>
<p>We have gone from the ability to control a tribe, to city-states, to duchies and fiefdoms, to nation-states, to world-wide empires.</p>
<p>Now, with the internet, mass surveillance tech, rapid travel, and mega-corporations and NGOs, the ability exists to use an apocalypse message to control the entire planet (see St Greta and the "climate change" cult - which is now being married in to the Corona-Apocalypse cult).</p>

        <p>I quote Michael Shellenberger: Environmentalism has become the dominant secular religion of people who don't believe in god anymore, looking for ways to condemn the whole world... There's something about that apocalyptic story of environmentalism that makes depressed people tend to be attracted to it.</p>

        <p>True. No one looks at Greta Thunberg and thinks "My, what a happy, well-adjusted child!".</p>
<p>She has the dead, cold eyes of a CHEKA executioner, and she hates us all. God help us if she ever attains political power.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your kind words.</p>
<p>They are kind of like a diary, a catharsis, for me. Memes and snark are fun, and have their place, but I believe the only way we will wake up the NPCs out there is by showing them historical parallels between Corona-madness, and the manifestations of collective madness of the past. </p>
<p>We need to make them laugh - but we also need to make them <em>think</em>.</p>

        <p>After all, Jesus is over 2,000 years late since he told his disciples that they will see the second coming <em>in their lifetime</em> (likely why the first testament was only an oral tradition and wasn't written down for nearly 100 years after his death). Jesus and Al Gore have a lot in common when it comes to false prophecy and determined followers that believe in things they don't understand.</p>
