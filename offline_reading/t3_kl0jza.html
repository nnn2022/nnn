        <p>" What is remarkable is that at a time when the public sphere has been so eroded, and regulations make it much more difficult to engage with each other, such a high degree of community-mindedness remains. What brings out the worst in people is not human nature but the social structures we inhabit that shape the ways we relate to each other, structures that too often incentivise the cynical and the selfish and deprecate generosity of spirit. "  </p>
<p>This, is what the New Normal is. This, is what we resist. We're not the idiots, we're not the worst in society, we're the only sane ones screaming about proportionality and resistance towards the pandemic being used to further social engineering by our governments and leaders, without oversight, without opposition, and all at the cost of our individual humanity and rights.</p>

        <p>Yep. I joined the r/Masks4All discord group and have convinced a few of the folks there that a globalist agenda is underway. </p>
<p>Many idiots there still, but hey I haven’t been banned yet so I have some faith. </p>
<p>At this point, continuing to put faith in these institutions is absolutely asinine. At this point, continuing to buy into the covid fear is absolutely asinine. </p>
<p>300k people have died ‘from’ covid in the U.S. (I’m being generous). It’s been a year, and therefore, the deaths for the new year go back to 0. If 300k is the worst it got, then absolutely under no fucking circumstances are these measures justified. </p>
<p>Millions of healthy people are now at risk for homelessness, depression/suicide, and other mental health issues for going fucking crazy during this shit-show of a year. Please tell me how that’s justified? </p>
<p>It’s like the analogy of a moving train. Would you rather kill one person or a group of people? I thought the choice here is obvious, but evidently, most people would rather commit genocide.</p>

        <p>Its good that people are waking up, but it's not going to do anything until we convert it to collective struggle and resistance. We can't waste 2021 like we wasted 2020.</p>
