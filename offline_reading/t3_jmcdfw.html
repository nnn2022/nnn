<p>It seems like many are saying they won't comply after a vaccine is available. I kind of have a feeling that the vaccines will all be flops and they're going to tell us this stuff is for the forseeable future with no vaccine. </p>
<p>Then the true doomers will find themselves increasingly isolated as more and more people begin to resist the new normal. </p>

        <p>It’s always hilarious when doomers get scared that the thing they hoped would be permanent, actually becomes permanent. It makes me wonder if they’ll ever realise like we skeptics do, that none of this is about containing a virus.</p>

        <p>Now that they know the election is going to be over it won't have political value as soon as the voting is done. So screeching about the virus becomes meaningless. Right now they think it's directly helping Biden. But I wouldn't be totally surprised if there was a backlash against the covid measures.</p>

        <p>Apparently the bookies in Vegas just flipped for Trump. I obviously can't be sure but I think there will be a huge upset on Tuesday and in no small part due to the mostly liberal response to the virus.</p>

        <p>This would make me SO HAPPY. I don’t give a flip about Trump as a person or even as a candidate, but the dems should be hung out to dry for feeding all this fear porn to people and destroying lives and livelihoods. The is fear versus moving into the future with our heads held high. I don’t want to fear to win. And id love to know all those unscientific “127% of Americans are terrified and want a mask mandate and a 10 year lockdown!” media polls were cooked. And that actually Americans want freedom and a future, not fear.</p>

        <p>That's where I'm at. I'm a reluctant Trump voter and mostly because I don't know how else to send the Dems a message. Either they take a step back and truly assess what happened or they crash and burn and we get a new party from the ashes.</p>

        <p>It's similar in the UK with NuLabour, but the thing is they were completely willing to take down the party, it wasn't just an 'oopsie'. If Trump wins the Democratic party can just continue being anti-Trump as their whole platform instead of offering real change. With Biden as a candidate less inspiring than lumpy porridge, does it really look like they want to win?</p>

        <p>I'm not sure. I think that many people have descended so far into the delusion that they have become so psychologically dependent on the idea of the pandemic their minds cannot accept any other alternate reality. Therefore anything that happens in the future will have still support and maintain the lie. </p>
<p>However, at this point I can't rule out any possibility</p>

        <p>You talking about the Santa Claara county study?</p>
<p>For me it changed when I saw the Chinese data that the WHO published- the report with a CFR of 3.4% Almost everyone who died was over the age of 70, and the risk was nonexistent for young adults and children. </p>
<p>Well I knew they were missing cases, so I put everything I had into the stock Market, convinced that this pandemic wasn’t gonna be that bad. I did NOT expect the severity of the lockdowns or the length of the lockdowns, but still made a bunch of money nonetheless.</p>

        <p>Personally I feel the doomers should be forced to live this life, especially after this is all said and done. They wanted it, and they wanted everyone else to have it. Now you have to reap what you sow. Regulate when they’re allowed to leave their houses, fine them and shame them for not wearing masking constantly, the whole nine yards. When they cry about how it’s not fair and no one has the right to make them do all that. Then maybe they’ll realize how stupid they were all along.</p>

        <p>No, it's not proper in a free society. What we need to do is create a better system of regulations so this doesn't happen again. The threshold to be able to do things like force masks and social distancing should be much much higher. The virus should have to be killing significant numbers of people WITHOUT comorbidities all across age groups. </p>
<p>This just shows that we don't really live in a free society. We don't have reasonable constraints on what government can do. </p>
<p>I'm a lefty, I'm a pro government guy, I believe in the role of government in making a better society. That's a separate argument, but the role of government is not to micromanage our lives. Collect taxes, pay for things we need, sustain the institutions that make up society. </p>
<p>If there really is a public health crisis, obviously they need to respond to that, but this proves that there's no reasonable threshold for when emergency powers can be used.</p>

        <p>If there’s a real public health crisis all the govt will need to do is tell us the stats of young ppl dying and we distance our own damn selves. People will hunker down. We have a sense of self preservation. It is not the governments job to do the shit they’ve done in almost ANY circumstances. It’s unbelievable. A pandemic doesn’t need a marketing campaign, it doesn’t need mandates. It’s naturally scary AF and people naturally protect themselves.</p>

        <p>Honestly this has shown and should show people the government won't save you..  </p>
<p>The best they will do is save themselves.  </p>
<p>Think about the panic buying of toilet paper.   </p>
<p>Think about the elites immediately fleeing to the country side and breaking the rules and not facing penalties (e.g gordon ramsay)  </p>
<p>If we have an actual situation where the end is coming, they will be <strong>playing it down. They won't be hamming up fear. They will play it down and buy time to get themselves sorted first.</strong>  </p>
<p>Trust me, if there was a food scarcity they'd secure food for themselves.  </p>
<p>All this stuff like Vallance having shares in the vaccine, contact tracing contacts that cost billions and cost millions per contract traced and pals of government making money..  </p>
<p>Just imagine how much that is amplified when the driving factor is SURVIVAL not GREED.  </p>
<p>We will get rationing, while they get to ensure their lifestyle continues.  </p>
<p>I can't believe people cannot see with governments doubling down and following through to cover their asses and making rules on a whim "no singing" random curfews that destroy businesses, how can you honestly say "oh well I think they should still have the power to do this, next time <em>they should use the power correctly"</em>  </p>
<p>It's not going to happen. The only reason we didn't get fucked with H1n1 is because Obama was president and stopped testing and the media didn't want to embarrass him and we didn't have it come from China and have their model to copy.  </p>
<p>Please. People. Wake up.  </p>
<p>No job will be created again as long as people know it will be wiped out by an arbitrary lockdown.  </p>
<p>There's no such thing as giving a politician "responsible" national lockdown powers. It won't happen.  </p>
<p>If we have a serious plague, you won't need to have a lockdown.  </p>
<p>If there was 10,000 ebola cases on the bus network, people would be hoarding hazmat suits and the buses would be largely empty.  </p>
<p>The roads were empty in March, people were paralysed with fear.  </p>
<p>I agree. I just wish people would realise how much they've been programmed. Survival is a human instinct. You don't need the government to tell you to stay home.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Just like the wildfires in Australia, or a Tsunami in Japan. The government gives you advice and tells you DO THIS IF YOU WANT TO LIVE. If you choose to be an idiot, you die. The advisorys in australia even say "if you are still at home it's too late to leave, the fire will catch you, find a place to shield as you may cook to death from heat exposure before smoke inhalation, good luck" in more civil terms.  </p>
<p>Again. Anyone reading this. Please let go of the attachment to the idea nationwide shut downs copied from China should remain normalised "JUST IN CASE IT"S FOR REALSIES"</p>

        <p>Many states are amending their constitutions to do just that. We need to preserve the governors' ability to declare emergencies and to act unilaterally during those times, but declared emergencies need either strict time expirations or the legislature needs the right to end them without veto.</p>

<p>Ah, so now you understand why a lot of people are against M4A, huh?</p>
<p>Except:</p>
<p>It's the patients fault that they have asthma?  That they have dementia?  Alzheimer's?  There are things that people can do to mitigate the risk of getting diabetes or chronic breathing or heart problems, but for many people, they're going to get it either way.</p>
<p>And even if it is their fault, how do you know that they had access to quality food?</p>
<p>&rt;The mortality rate is similar. It's comparable to the flu. A tiny fraction of people are dying from Covid.</p>
<p>The IFR rate is similar for <em>some</em> age groups.  The IFR and mortality rate are not the same measurement.</p>
<p>&rt;You're trying to argue that half of Americans are at risk to die from Covid when that's not the case and you know it.</p>
<p>More than half of Americans <em>are</em> at risk.  "At risk" is not the same thing as "will die."</p>

<p>Except countries that control the virus are doing better than those that aren't, and just because restrictions are lifted doesn't mean people will consume if it isn't safe.</p>
<p>Also, the police and the right bear a lot of the blame for how your city is doing, not the virus.</p>

<p>It is though, in terms of the population as a whole, lots of people in nursing homes on their deathbeds. Plus basically any person who died that they managed to administer a PCR test to. Now you can't enter a hospital without getting one. They're recording gunshot wounds and car accidents as covid deaths. </p>

        <p>&rt;Not nothing, encourage hand washing and social distancing, but no mandates unless a virus is much more severe in terms of the whole population. We can't just do all this for any little virus, there needs to be better limits.</p>
<p>But it's not "any little virus."  Do you think it's normal to be admitting people to field hospitals in the US?</p>
<p>&rt;Yeah, because corporate media isn't misleading! Only what you want to hear is valid.</p>

<p>That's not on a widespread basis, and hospitals get overwhelmed during flu season and other times anyways. It is literally "any little virus" It's not any different than any other virus we've dealt with. </p>
<p>&rt;In our talks about covid, my main source has been the CDC.</p>

<p>Hospitals hitting capacity happens a lot.  What doesn't happen a lot is ALL the hospitals in an area becoming overwhelmed to the point of treating people in a public park.</p>
<p>&rt;It is literally "any little virus" It's not any different than any other virus we've dealt with.</p>

<p>Well, aside from the fact that I don't feel the urge to complain about everything I don't like on Reddit, "bitching that he should be hauled off the to the Hague" would be pretty dumb, because the United States isn't party to the ICC.</p>

Plenty of people are staying away from places when in an area where the virus is out of control.  Plenty workers would be out of a job.  We should be paying them until it's under control.</p>

<p>No, they're not. They won't eliminate the virus forever, even NZ that has high compliance and got cases way down, they lock down when 1 case shows up, and they are masking permanently. That's not an acceptable solution and it doesn't fit the problem. Not only that it's virtually inapplicable in the USA. Maybe it's time to accept that people aren't going to do this forever and plan accordingly, instead of just stubbornly trying to force people. That will lead to a backlash eventually. </p>

<p>&rt;How low do the various metrics have to be? How long to they need to stay that way? The people in power won't answer these questions.</p>
<p>Every state had metrics and thresholds; few states actually followed them and reopened before they actually met the metrics.</p>

I was surprised about the testing positive rate--most states use 5% as a threshold, following federal guidance.</p>
<p>&rt;While we've all heard the NPR stories about the cool new ghost restaurant that's doing amazing, they never air people who have lost everything. Or at least not as much as the fluffy stories.</p>
<p>I never said that plenty of places aren't hurting--they are.  And the government should be doing more to prop them up.  </p>

<p>The best way to help people would be to help prevent them getting sick with a disease that medicine still has a limited effect on.</p>
<p>Also, I'd happily have M4A--I support it.</p>

<p>I picked it because it's a common one that is used, and for good reason: if the virus is spreading quickly, that's bad.</p>
<p>Also, the reason that the 5% positivity rate is usually the threshold is because getting above that makes it hard for contact tracing to keep up.  I don't know about Minnesota, but I know other states have pulled their contact tracers to call people letting them know they tested positive, their bureaucratic infrastructure is becoming overwhelmed.</p>
<p>&rt;But it doesn't say at what point ALL the measures can end. If it does and I'm missing it, please paste the exact language that says what numbers mean total stop.</p>
<p>Well, no.  But here you go: according to the metrics, Minnesota should have actually gone to a previous phase.  Clearly the government isn't following its own plans.</p>
<p>And yup--Minnesota seems to be the outlier in not having super transparent metrics, but that might actually work out in your favor.  It looks like the state is thinking about dialing back a bit, but they're saying that they won't fully go to phase two and look at everything again.</p>
<p>&rt;That's fine, but we still need to reopen. We can't hide from the virus forever.</p>
<p>There are plenty of enjoyable things that one can do in the current situation.  No one actually likes this, but it's preferable to letting it run roughshod through the population.</p>

        <p>&rt; I picked it because it's a common one that is used, and for good reason: if the virus is spreading quickly, that's bad.
&rt; 
&rt; Also, the reason that the 5% positivity rate is usually the threshold is because getting above that makes it hard for contact tracing to keep up. I don't know about Minnesota, but I know other states have pulled their contact tracers to call people letting them know they tested positive, their bureaucratic infrastructure is becoming overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The common cold spreads a lot too, and some people die of it. Death rates are what matters. Anything else can't justify this kind of response. Otherwise we should just do this forever because any virus exists. </p>
<p>&rt;Well, no. But here you go: according to the metrics, Minnesota should have actually gone to a previous phase. Clearly the government isn't following its own plans.</p>

<p>Okay, that doesn't make this situation any better. As you can see even people who were fully onboard are starting to crack under this madness. I think people like you actually do like it, it advances your politics. The politics of experts.</p>

<p>Not nearly the number of people who are dying of COVID.  </p>

<p>The mortality rate for COVID is much higher than that of the common cold.</p>

<p>&rt;Again, there is no exit strategy. The plan is to keep all these measures until we get a vaccine and we may never get one , or it could be years from now. This isn’t sustainable.</p>

<p>Literally the same could be said for anything.  Should we stop spending taxpayer money on cancer research?  The number of people who die from it is tiny in comparison to the entire population.</p>
<p>&rt; and many were on their deathbeds and died of other things and it's being recorded as Covid. The authorities admit they're doing this.</p>
<p>Mistakes happen.  The ones that have been found have been fixed, and there's no evidence that it's happening on a widespread scale.</p>
<p>&rt;Sure looks like we're there now. Time to end the measures.</p>
<p>Did you miss this part of the article?:</p>
<p>&rt;That's a big improvement, but 7.6% is still a high risk compared with other diseases, and Horwitz and other researchers caution that COVID-19 remains dangerous.</p>
<p>So, no, we're not there yet.</p>
<p>&rt;No predictions, but without the scamdemic Biden would be totally irrelevant, he could never beat Trump.</p>
<p>I mean, a week is a long time in politics, so it's not like it's predictive, but head-to-head polls pre-pandemic had Biden polling ahead of Trump.  While that doesn't guarantee that there would have been a Biden win, I think we can rule out that the hypothesis that but for the pandemic, he would not be able to beat Trump.</p>
<p>I think it's likely, though, that Trump would have sailed to re-election if he did any kind of half-assed measure at the beginning of it all.</p>

<p>We do change the way we live our lives, though.  We have less money because we pay more in taxes for cancer research.  We raise excise taxes on cigarettes to discourage smoking.  Many states have banned smoking in bars and restaurants to protect patrons and workers.  Society has literally changed just around cigarettes, not to mention all of the other ways that rules and restrictions are placed on various behaviors to protect people.  Do you complain that you're required to wear a seatbelt?  Very few people die from automobile accidents, after all.</p>

        <p>It matters insofar as it's a measure of how deadly the virus is to the majority of the population. In order to put in these kinds of rules the threshold should be much higher.  I don't agree that a virus comparable to the flu justifies these measures.</p>

<p>OK?  But their risk is much higher; this affects them.</p>
<p>OK, two things:</p>
<p>1) In comparison, the ratio is approximately 2.5 times greater than the estimated IFR for seasonal influenza, 0.8% (1 in 125), among those aged 65 years and older. Of note, the IFR for non-Whites is more than 3 times that for Whites, despite COVID-19 decedents in that group being 5.6 years younger on average.</p>
<p>So for many people, IFR is decidedly <em>not</em> similar to the flu.</p>
<p>2) For other groups where the IFR is <em>actually</em> somewhat similar, the fact that the flu has a vaccine and covid does not means that people are going to be more susceptible at contracting covid as compared to the flu.  While the IFR may be similar, the fact that more people can <em>catch</em> covid means that more people will die.</p>
<p>And that's all if you want to ignore partial and herd immunities, which plays a much different role in the flu and covid.</p>

        <p>There is evidence that a lot of people actually have partial immunity to the coronavirus because there are many other viruses in that family. </p>
<p>That estimate is old, according to the new CDC estimates I provided the IFR is much lower. They took an example of one state, but applied at large with new data it looks as if it's much lower. </p>

        <p>The problem begins with the fact that they shouldn't be using the PCR test to diagnose illness in the first place. If you do use it to diagnose then you need to lower the cycle threshold.

        <p>I think one of the big mistakes the media and the people in power pushing this have made, is making it sound like the vaccine will end all of this. Recently they have been trying to walk that back, I've seen a ton of pieces saying "The vaccine won't end the coronavirus measures for x y and z reasons" (basically same old shit we don't know anything about the virus it's a complete mystery lol). </p>
<p>That's the problem with trying to be like 1984 and change narratives constantly. Eventually people get confused. For months it was "until we get a vaccine" Now it's "Well, even after the vaccine" And that's when people snap from Covid fatigue. That's what I believe we're seeing on that thread. The early cracks in the armor will eventually form dominant fissures.</p>

        <p>Someone in the comments actually did call out the apparent flip-flopping that Fauci does (although they attributed it to news media misrepresenting his words, rather than Fauci himself being useless).  The comment even has positive karma right now.</p>
<p>Of course someone else rushed right in to claim that Fauci has been consistent and ACKSHUALLY evil orang man is the one who keeps flip-flopping (wtf?  he has been anti-mask and pushing for re-opening consistently since day one).  But it is a good sign that <em>somebody</em> on that sub finally questioned the Gospel according to Fauci.</p>

        <p>Oh I completely agree. I don’t know how much of the Biden-voting crowd this actually makes up but I would say a large minority at least. I swear that it’s a way to feel better than someone else - you can not be doing that well in life personally or professionally but you’re not a racist white supremacist Trump voter so you’re better. I mean we all do this to some extent (e.g., I splurge on a nice purse every now and I’d be lying if I said wasn’t motivated in some part (hopefully small) to show off I can afford it). But what does really get me is the actual demonization of large swaths of “regular” human beings in order for someone to get a dopamine kick from feeling like they’ve ascended one step higher in the morality totem pole. There has never been a group of 63 mi people in the world who are all terrible people. It is insane based on lived experience to say that every trump supporter is a racist - you have to be actively feeding off that sort of hatred to say that and/or to convince yourself that’s true.</p>

        <p>Wow nothing but anti lockdown comments on there. I’m absolutely shocked. </p>
<p>I think most of these people are finally realizing the sort of time scales it realistically will take to get back to “normal” if we simply wait for the government to give the all clear. </p>

        <p>Yep, as we said before. Even doomers have their breaking point, they're still human, and even the most hardcore ones will eventually get fed up of not being able to live life normally.</p>
<p>This is why I wasn't too worried once I saw Fauci say 2022, it was predictable some would eventually start to rethink everything in hindsight, cause I'm sure the majority of them don't have the willpower to even last till mid 2021, nevermind 2022. Wrong move, Fauci, moved the goalposts too far to the point that even your worshippers are starting to reconsider.</p>

        <p>There isnt going to be a vaccine.</p>
<p>Normal vaccine cycles take years to make. Most diseases can’t be vaccinated (consider influenza; has to be re-vaccinated every year. Or HIV, 20+ years no vaccine. Or malaria, no vaccine. Or SARS). Then you have issues of scaling; vaccinate millions of people requires huge infrastructure that can’t be pulled from thin air.</p>
<p>Even if everything goes absolutely right, they rush the vaccine out without doing any testing and it is 100% safe, and go full Stalin organizing distribution, you’re not getting a vaccine till late 2021, probably longer, and that’s just for the richest/most important members of society. Vaccinating everybody is heading well 22-24. And that assumes everything goes absolutely right from jump street and we have no major set-backs or issues with the vaccine <em>despite</em> doing like 1/5 the normal amount of research/testing we normally would.</p>
<p>The vaccine is a pipe dream and there’s no reason to believe it will be discovered, let alone rolled out and administered in a reasonable timeline. Civic unrest always happens in the summer, right now we’re heading into a winter lock-down in most western democracies. If this lockdown runs as long as the last one (3 months or so) and we see another 5-15% GDP drop (as predicted in France), summer 2021 will be such a mess that there won’t need to <em>be</em> a vaccine because everybody will be in the streets burning shit down. There’ll be nothing left to vaccinate, at that point we’d be heading for herd immunity.</p>
<p>The only reason everybody is talking about the vaccine is it’s a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. People need something to believe in and the idea that the biotech sector will bail us out is that something. But it’s not gonna happen and people who are serious about navigating this crisis need to act as though it’s not going to happen</p>

        <p>Christakis isn’t an epidemiologist though. He’s primarily a sociologist and author who has mainly studied research on AI and social networks. </p>
<p>Some of his best known research is on how AI “bots” can influence people on making “intelligent health decisions.”</p>
<p>This type of research has directly or indirectly supported the lockdowns and if you listen to him speak about Covid you will find that he is 100% Doomer. </p>

        <p>Listen humans can only take so much psychological warfare until they break. The ones that are committing suicide have broken. We just need people to fight back and keep fighting. I truly believe they want us dead and that's why we haven't seen "real" leadership in this whole ordeal.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>/u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/XareUnex/">XareUnex</a> left this amazing comment... It was deleted after 3 hours for "low quality". Only figured out when it was removed just as I tried to send a response:  </p>
<p>"Folks, problem is, by agreeing to all this, we have signed a new social contract. Mitigating specific death now matters more that most of the tenets that give life quality. If preventing death though complete abrogation of rights and freedoms is what is necessary now, then it is what is necessary always. If anything, we could be living in guilt about how apathetic we've been about our dedication to save lives in the past.</p>
<p>Deaths don't stop mattering because you are sick of masks and lockdowns, and by this rubric, even after covid, other excess deaths must take precedence as the sole directive of humanity. To not do so would render everything lockdowners support now as hypocritical, otherwise death only matters during certain peaks and in certain ways.</p>
<p>The longer people buy into this, the smaller life becomes, the more propaganda is ingrained, the more people adapt, the more authoritarian it is allowed to be, the worse it will get, regardless of whether there's still a viral threat or not in a few years.</p>
<p>Once you start going down a path like this, it doesn't just switch off one day, it continues to cascade. That is the choice that was made, and it's not as simple as setting your own personal deadline to stop complying well after it's too late."</p>

        <p>I never underestimate those in power and therefore remain skeptical. This could be part of the master plan, testing people's resilience to compliance. Reading the article in the link it seems more like an effort to force the fence sitters into choosing a side and / or just making the leadership look incompetent. If you're a true blue believer you will wear that mask and comply to every rule for as long as it takes and when the vaccine arrives you will run to the line up for it. Could you imagine getting vaccinated for a flu virus that's two years old lol. However, I can imagine that creating a clear distinction between the two segments (believer's and non-believer's) is a necessity to move into future phases of the overall agenda..</p>
<p>Always hope I'm wrong becasue it would be awesome if people were to wake up.</p>

        <p>Hahaha it is an advantage that we have been coping with these nightmares for far longer. I was telling my mom yesterday the harcore doomers can't keep it up forever. They will get burnouts from a continuous stress response and they will crack and join us in the end after a mental breakdown.</p>
<p>Then they will act like it is a good thing that we held on for as long as possible. But loads of them will become crazier than we are because they were gaslighted for longer and deeper than we were.</p>
