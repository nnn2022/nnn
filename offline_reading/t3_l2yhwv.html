    <strong>Anyone else on a campus right now, because it’s ridiculous on mine.</strong>
    <p><p>Here are some of the “lovely” rules that my campus has instituted to help stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Weekly testing as mandated by NYS’s illustrious governor, the great Andrew Cuomo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orders at school dining facilities can only be made through Grubhub. It would be far too dangerous to have people wait in line to get their food. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school dining hall allows no in-person seating. This is to discourage socialization. Fuck me, I’ve barely seen anyone here. There wouldn’t be any harm in allowing in person at the dining hall because there’s literally nobody on campus to begin with. It’s no even like it’d be crowded or a thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks must be worn in every common area, even if you’re the only person in the room. I shit you not, there’s a sign in my residence hall’s main lounge that says “mask required even when alone.” You also can’t eat or drink anywhere in your residence hall except your room, as that would require removing your mask.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have to wear my mask to the bathroom that is literally two feet from my room. It is a bathroom shared with the my roommate and the room adjacent to our room. There is literally no reason for this other than to be like “be safe and wear a mask guys!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our spring break got taken away as mandated by NYS. We now have three random days off throughout the semester, and the state required them to be in the fucking middle of the week to discourage travel. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No in person events or clubs. People literally got kicked out of school for doing so last semester. It’s fucking insane.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, these were the main rules that I thought were stupid as fuck. I’m wondering if there are any other college students on here, and if there are, what are some ridiculous rules that your campus’s have? I’d really like to see if mine is an extreme outlier or if all campus’s are like this.</p></p>

        <p>I have to be on-campus to do lab classes. If I wasn’t, I’d be fucked because they took away the option to do online labs. Basically, the school wants to make money by forcing people to be on-campus but took basically all the on-campus perks away.</p>
