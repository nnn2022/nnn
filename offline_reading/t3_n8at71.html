    <strong>Forced vaccines aren't about health.</strong>
    <p><p>When's the last time your doctor forced you to do something, consciously, against your will, for your health? </p>
<p>To this day, I haven't heard of a doctor forcing their patients to stop smoking, because it causes cancer.</p>
<p>They don't force obese people to exercise, and manage their diet, which would help them avoid a myriad of critical health problems, including heart disease.</p>
<p>They don't force their patients to avoid sunburns, to reduce their chance of skin cancer.</p>
<p>As far as I know, they can't even force you to take chemotherapy for cancer.</p>
<p>They don't even force all former vaccines on people, which were created for far worse diseases than covid 19. </p>
<p>Neither do politicians do any of these things, for any of the people they are supposed to represent. </p>
<p>But now we're supposed to accept the idea of an absolutely mandatory vaccine for a coronavirus that has an over 99.9% survival rate? </p>
<p>A new, experimental "vaccine" that doesn't even have disabled viruses in it? Which has killed people? </p>
<p>Created by companies which are, ironically, immune to any form of liability? Who also make $billions off these injections? </p>
<p>It doesn't add up and never will. If someone wants a questionable injection against an easily survived coronavirus, that's their business. But requiring the rest of us to get it for "health" is just plain bullshit.</p></p>

        <p>Because it isn't "my body, my choice"
It's "Our immunity for safety"</p>
<p>And of course patient consent is a thing. But diseases that were almost eradicated came back because of people not getting vaccinated, such as measles for example. The truth is, we have proof of the efficacity, security and protection of vaccines, we have for almost half a century now. Not trying to look objectivly at the situation is the real issue right now. </p>
<p>You can refuse the vaccine all you want. But the longer the pandemy will get, and the more death we will have. It's called common sense.</p>

        <p>It isn't a shield thought. No shit you don't believe in it if you don't even know what is does. The goal of a vaccine is to train your immune system to create anti bodies and next time you will be infected you will either react well and most of thr times with very little symptoms, or you will still get the disease but at least your body is now trained to respond to the same situation.</p>

        <p>Right. A vaccine trains the body to.fight the illness. Which them makes you immune and acts as a shield. This experimental treatment doesn't do that and hence doesn't make it a vaccine. You ass.</p>

        <p>If it were experimental, no studies would have been done on the product and it would still be in testing. If it is released to the public, it means that the medical field had reviewed it and decided that it is safe for public use. It's not that hard. </p>
<p>And still, it isn't a shield, it's protection. It's never 100% safe and can have side effects. But just like every other medication. Pain killer and birth control are 2 of the biggest examples of this. But i don't see you bashing theses products either. Unless you do and in that case, I can do nothing for you bud.</p>

        <p>*A dead embryo. The legal delay in most countries is 12 weeks. It isn't a baby yet. It's like calling a seed a tree. Yes it can grow into one, but as long as you don't plant it, take care of it, feed and water it, it'll never grow. Whereas babies as young as 6 months can survive in an incubator. A 12 weeks old embryo cannot.
However, I am repulsed by laws like in China were Abortions can happen for the 9 months of the pregnancy. That is fucked up.</p>

        <p>Drink the Kool-aid is an expression referring to communist Jim Jones, who started a cult in the 1970s and convinced hundreds of cult members to drink kool-aid that had poison in it. Many people died. </p>
<p>Now "drink the kool-aid" refers to anytime someone does something a leader tells them without thinking.</p>

        <p>It has never been about a virus, that was just to scare the shit out of enough idiots so they can start implementing the start of complete societal control, it started off with them locking people in their homes and then we have rapidly got to the point of "vaccine passports".</p>

        <p>Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."</p>
<p>"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are <strong>etc.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c</strong>, and <strong>et cet.</strong> The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. </p>

Most people accept that the official 9/11 story is bullshit, but won't see how this is the same shit different day. All the UFO media isn't coincidental either. More fuel for our tin hat fires.</p>

        <p>Agreed. The parallels to 9/11 are undeniable:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The government allowed it to happen, having the knowledge and ability to do something about it before it became a problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making people scared of an invisible threat (weapons of mass destruction / asymptomatic carriers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removal of freedoms for "our safety"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using propaganda to gaslight anybody that disagrees with the official narrative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making people irrationally scared of people (Muslim hate)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blaming the wrong people (Gaslighting that China started it / ignoring Saudi Arabias influence)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably more than that, but it's eerily similar.</p>

        <p>About 5 years ago, blue states really ramped up vaccine mandates for school children. California for example, dropped the personal belief exemption then cracked down hard on medical exemptions. It happened across the country and was the groundwork for what we're seeing today. Also, the narrative that the anti-vax crowd being crazy was brought into the mainstream and now here we are. If you refuse the experimental covid shot, you are a selfish, crazy anti-vaxxer.</p>

        <p>This is how it's done.</p>
<p>Push an idea upon a community, see how people react. If they accept it, push the idea on another, larger group. If people resist then step back and work a different angle.</p>
<p>Eventually we reach their end goal either way. To the powerful decision makers the world is one large playground. Only the plebeians believe in national borders because we have been brainwashed from first schooling to see the world that way.</p>

        <p>Oh, but that's when it does makes sense. </p>
<p>There are three options here:</p>
<p>1) Everything governments are doing is based on good, reputable and repeatable science. (We know this to be false)</p>
<p>2) There's a gigantic global conspiracy led in part by China to bring about The Great Reset and universal social credit scores</p>
<p>3) Highest levels of government reacted as they did because they knew it was man-made, and politicians around the world started to catch a case of "gotta-do-something"-itis</p>
<p>This doesn't excuse the dramatic and inexcusable government overreaches, but I do think it's reasonable to believe most people think they're doing the right thing.</p>
<p>It's either that or the global conspiracy, which I admit I have no evidence against at this juncture.</p>

        <p>&rt; To this day, I haven't heard of a doctor forcing their patients to stop smoking, because it causes cancer.
They don't force obese people to exercise, and manage their diet, which would help them avoid a myriad of critical health problems, including heart disease.
They don't force their patients to avoid sunburns, to reduce their chance of skin cancer.
As far as I know, they can't even force you to take chemotherapy for cancer.</p>
<p>I am terrified that this is what the world will become in the near future. To "save the healthcare systems". As a "duty to your fellow citizens". Even in anti-new normal groups, there are undercurrents of "I eat healthily and exercise so I'm doing my bit", as if it's a duty you owe everybody else. I have a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach, that one day everybody will be <em>forced</em> to be healthy. (Theoretically) physically healthy of course, mental health will be as dismissed as it has been for the past year.</p>

        <p>It’s people like you who make me effing SICK! “For a thing that has 99.9% survival rate?” That’s what your saying, yeah? Sure thing! Even though our country ALONE has had damn near a HALF MILLION DEATHS and over 7,000 people died in my state ALONE! India has over 21 MILLION effing cases and almost 300,000 deaths that r rising by the minute! No damn shit doctors r probably forcing people. Cuz it’s dumb ass people like you and so many others who r spreading falsified rumors about the vaccines making people afraid to get them..meaning we could end up having over half our country alone refusing to vaccinate and if that continues to happen because of peoples bs stories , with these new strains that keep coming and with numbers still rising in certain places..I mean damn, we’re gonna go from a half million people dead in our country to MILLIONS more dead in our country! Like duh, it’s known the vaccine was made quick and doesn’t have too much time behind it with side effects and whatever else but what is pretty much clear and known and proven is the affective ness that it ha against people getting COVID after having the vaccines and it’s almost 95% proven already! I’d  rather put some trust into it knowing our country had to scurry to make a vaccine without the ability to have years and years testing it, and save thousands of millions of peoples lives then not take it being hard headed and dumb and possibly losing over half of our countries population. For you idiots that think it’s micro chipped, or some dumb crap. Think again..my nurse let me fully examine mine before I got it and no there’s not! And thinking this is the mark of the beast? Clearly you people don’t read the Bible correctly because it won’t be anything of that sort, it says forehead or right hand ! And many more details that totally give the vaccine away and out the equation. Just get with it already !</p>

<p>Vaccines causing bloodclots, and pausing Johnson and Johnson for safety reasons certainly doesnt help people feel confident, right? We had nothing to do with those shenanigans.</p>
<p>When you can separate out exactly how much hesitancy is caused by THAT, as opposed to US .. then you can get back to us.</p>

        <p>I was a skeptical one. I completely refused and swore I’d never vaccinate to this..that is until I seen my doctor last week and truly seen the fear in his eyes and listened to his pure words of wisdom and advice and thought on this all. I’m very good at reading thru peoples truth lies and bs and I knew he was speaking from the heart and he warned me for one, yes Johnson and Johnson he didn’t recommend at this moment for obvious reasons but he also made a valid statement that although there are a couple concerns of what it is causing people ..you have to look at the ODDS! How many people developed that out of probably millions and millions..probably not even a 5 percent out of a 100. Which really ain’t bad for something that was created THIS fast! Not only that , it has yet to cause a single death! Corona is what mfks need to rlly worry about! Look how many deaths it caused!</p>

        <p>My point is THAT kind of stuff caused hesitancy.  </p>
<p>When the medical establishment says "Hey we are going to roll out a massive vaccination program, but dont worry it will be totally safe for you because we have done all the necessary tests!!!!"</p>
<p>.. and then there are weird <em>issues</em>, that doesnt make people confident.</p>
<p>That makes people say "But I thought you said this was all totally safe?  I guess you were .. <em>wrong</em> with that?"</p>
<p>And that is not "us" who did that.</p>

You come in here with some asinine straw man argument (example: microchips), rattle off the death numbers to invoke more fear, start slinging insults and name calling, and then following it up with demanding we get the vaccine.

        <p>LMFAO.  You must be one of those people who just run off at the mouth tryna say things you think is funny or smart but really sounds super ignorant and dumb. Go back to my basement? LOL! Too bad I don’t need to cuz I have a flat screen in every room of my house including our bathrooms. I’d rather go there but there’s no need when I have CNN app downloaded to my phone as well as having my phone linked to the number that texts you REAL true updates on Corona cases and vaccines of my state itself. Proof is in the pudding. No need to demand anyone to get vaccines. It’s all up to them :) So I’ll just sit back and wish whoever luck who doesn’t! But also microchips was my argument huh? That’s what I’m tryna say! If u know how to read! I’m sick of EVERYBODY else arguing about darn MICROchips! Not me! Besides the fact it sounds so stupid and super un educated for any being who truly believes that!</p>

        <p>Millions of people die every day. Over a half of a million Americans die every year from heart disease, cancer and other more deadly diseases. You will never be able to prevent death, get over it. “SOO many people have DIED” is not a reason to lockdown healthy humans. New strains are almost ALWAYS weaker than the originals.</p>

        <p>Lmao like wow. Ignorance must be a virtue. Sorry not sorry. You said “millions of people die everyday.” Lmao! Like is that not enough?! DUH! Your right! In 2019 alone BEFORE COVID..us had  2,614,950 deaths total that year! &amp; then here comes 2020.. now add COVID deaths alone ONTOP the number of everyday common deaths already had in a year. You sound so ridiculous! No one is trying to “prevent death always” seeing how it’s nearly impossible clearly. But unlike most other deaths like, overdose..heart attacks..strokes..etc that can hit u in a split second or someone else..WE actually can make a difference on slowing the spread and then eventually SAVING thousands if not millions of deaths from COVID just through ourself alone. We actually have somewhat of a “job to do” whether that be preventing urself from getting it so that you don’t spread it and then that person u spread it to spread it and then it gets spread to then someone who dies who spread it to their family before hand and now maybe one of their relatives died as well too ! Type crap. We have a huge responsibility in this. Period. And no ones tryna be covid save a <strong>*</strong> but damn, have a heart. Even if u haven’t caught it yet urself and ur family has managed to stay safe thruout the time of it so far and u “think in such a cocky manner that you and ur family r untouchable” or whatever the thought or cause may be, whether being “oh if I catch it..I won’t die cuz I’m young and physically fit..” .....”even though I’m young and physically fit, I could spread it to a person who that person then spreads it to a elder person who has breathing problems and then they die and it all comes back to me” ..but “nope I don’t care cuz I’m fit and young with no health problems so nope I’m not gonna get the shot thinking of myself and only myself” and if someone else dies along the way cuz I didn’t get the shot and end up catching covid unknowingly and then spread it to many others of which caused someone to then die ..well so what then..long as I’m okay” HAH that’s how you arrogant people sound and it’s ridiculous</p>

        <p>Nice strawmen! Did you know that “Deaths of despair” have been WAY up this past year? Overdoses, domestic murders and suicides have risen incredibly, and you people don’t seem to care about them at all. While we all hide in our basements to protect 80 year olds from dying a few years earlier, thousands of young people are killing themselves because of the burden of being locked away. Where’s your compassion for them? Where’s your compassion for those of us who have had our businesses destroyed? What about those of us who are now trying to feed our families off of one income? What about our children who have to sit in front of their screens all day and not see their friends, not see their families, not meet other people and try new things? What do you think will be the long term effects of this lockdown on future generations? What about the young, healthy children that are afraid to leave their homes? The ones who think they will die if they go outside? People like you are fucking up our nations’s youth over a virus that barely effects the young and the healthy. It’s sick and we will pay the price. Do me a favor, look at the number of deaths in the US from 2020 and compare that number to the previous years, you will be surprised at what you see. Check out the US census data and get back to me 😘</p>

        <p>I refuse to keep talking with a “know it all”, mkay? Because your “what about this and that bs that I supposedly don’t care about” is making me giggle. Not only am I pursing mediumship.. I have always my whole entire life been the super sensitive person who has ALWAYS cared so much about everything and everyone else before myself to where if I seen something horrifying on the news, it’d eat me away for weeks months if not years.. if I heard of someone committing suicide, or passing away..even if I didn’t personally know them but just knew “of them”..I was the one who would break my back trying to support a family of who I didn’t even know and while it would affect me mentally, physically and emotionally just the thought of how these people went. I have only two baby cousins on my mothers side, who belonged one of each to both of my two aunts... &amp; I lost them both months apart from eachother in 2020. My baby cousin was ejected from a vehicle flying through windshield, into of which he flew straight into a pole and then the car landed straight ontop of him crushing the whole left side of his body.. lost him..months later , my only other baby girl cousin who wasn’t even 16 yet..supposedly overdosed but had signs of being beaten damn near to death and murdered..lost her. Both my parents.. been addicts of the most horrific street drugs their entire life. I was thrown into foster care, group homes, residential treatment facilities and even dentention from the age of 13 til I was 18 and was on the run most of those years trying to find the only family I knew even though they were so unhealthy for me and neglectful. I became hooked onto opiates at 14 and progressed onto heroin and others, overdosed to many times to count. Don’t know why I even am still here. I have suffered numerous times of being suicidal and attempting then to be thrown in multiple mental facilities and medicated on all different depression anxiety PTSD medicine.. had my first kid at 14 , taken from me and ripped out of my arms . Fought for years just to for my rights to get terminated. Had my second kid at 17 and they took her just because I had my first taken in a 5 yr span..fought for her years and was the most hardest painful thing I ever went thru ! Then just for them to terminate me. After that pain and suffering now I’m 5 &amp; a half years clean and sober and had my third child who will be 5..settled down, going for nursing and a couple other things as we speak. Let me tell you, I damn near done seen it all and more then half of what I have been through won’t ever be spoken. But what was, is 1000% truth and nothing more but that! And iv never just put it out there but my god does it piss me off when someone portrays like they just know your character and almost everything u said was wrong. Iv struggled thru this pandemic like no other ontop of isolating and suffering hardcore PTSD depression anxiety add..and some. Income dropped more then half. On my mans side at one point and I stay at home mom.</p>

        <p>What you should understand is that most people who are choose to refrain from getting a covid vaccine do not do so because they believe in "falsified rumors".  For instance, I do not think that the vaccine will give me the mythical "Mark of the Beast".  </p>
<p>I have read extensively on the risks of covid-19, including sources that were not prepared by American government agencies, such as reports from doctors and medical experts who are employed by hospitals and universities.  Based on that knowledge, I believe that my personal immune system will handle the disease if I catch it, assuming I haven't caught it already .  I do not think that the vaccine is medically necessary for me.  </p>
<p>As for if I will affect others by this decision, this time I defer to the government authorities.  We have been told by government agencies that the covid-19 vaccines are perfectly safe.  There is no group who is advised against getting it, if I remember correctly.  Therefore, those who want the vaccine can get it, and those who don't want it, are highly unlikely to have any affect on all those people who have chosen to be protected.  </p>
<p>And the theory about how unvaccinated people will become petri dishes for variants is exactly that: a theory.</p>

        <p>The CDC has come out and stated that a mere 4 or 5% of covid deaths were people who only had covid and no other health concerns. The numbers you hear on the news are a misrepresentation of reality because they don't include in the explanation how many people die every year anyway. Covid hasn't made that big of a dent. </p>
<p>Anyway, that's all stuff we can argue about, it's all good. The real problem is, if we disagree, why do you and your fellow likeminded friends get to decide that the rest of us get the vaccine? Why can't you get it and be happy? Why steal the autonomy of others? Once you head down that path, there's no telling what might happen. Well, there is. It's called slavery and tyranny.</p>

        <p>They don’t force you to do so, just restrict some things. Same thing for not taking other vaccines. Some vaccines are required for children to go to school. Private institution have a right to refuse service or make the vaccine a requirement for work which is what you are complaining about so there’s not really anything to complain about here. What are you complaining about? Seems like you’re only complaining about private institutions. Also, the shot doesn’t even have very bad side effects, and is shown to be partially effective. Of course it’s still experimental but there’s not much harm in taking it. I don’t understand the outcry here. Seems like people are angry at the government for forcing them to do literally anything, and that you all are saying that they’re trying to instill obedience and all that crap. </p>
<p>For people who criticize people exaggerating COVID, ironic that you’re over exaggerating private business’s right to refuse service and employ and fire who they want as long as they aren’t being fired for being something they cannot control.</p>

        <p>Read my whole thing. You’re gripe is with private businesses who guess what? Have a right to refuse service or hire and fire people unless if something they cannot control. Also, have you heard of this thing called herd immunity? If tons of people get a vaccine, then less people will get infected. It’s experimental. Ok. But it’s still partially effective. Meaning that it’s an improvement over no vaccine. Also, no people have actually died from it so far, and all side effects seem to be temporary. </p>
<p>You don’t want to vaccinate yourself still? Ok then. Then you get the consequences for not getting it which is having a chance of being denied services. You have a choice, as much as a choice that businesses have to either refuse or to not refuse service to you.</p>

<p>You really think that a vaccine is able to kill you? I don’t even think there is a single death ever from a vaccine. Literally the only way to happen is extreme negligence or it’s on purpose which makes no sense. You call people too fearful of COVID then you say vaccines are going to kill a large portion of the population.</p>

        <p>Private businesses. Can. Refuse. Service. No one is requiring it. It’s your choice. But also a business’s choice if they want to serve you. The vaccine isn’t forced. However, businesses can deny you service or employment because you aren’t vaccinated. Who is forcing you to take a vaccine? No one. No one is forcing you. What do you not understand? No one if forcing you, but businesses can deny you services, because they also have a choice. I’ve said this before but apparently I need to say it again.</p>

        <p>I literally said nothing about politics in that last reply (?).</p>
<p>Yes, masks are debatable. But I say everyone should have the choice if they want to wear them.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I disagree. Firstly, this is not some horrid disease that's wiping out majorities of groups of people. 99.9% + people who get it survive it. </p>
<p>Secondly, and especially due to the rate of survival, stripping people of their civil liberties, instituting curfews, dishing out fines, shutting down churches, and closing small businesses is not justifiable in the name of not spreading a disease. Especially for a fucking year+.</p>

        <p>Secondhand smoke is actually very bad for people. Worse than what the smoker is inhaling since secondhand smoke does not go through a filter. Secondhand smoke also sticks to cloth and fabric and becomes third hand smoke, which is being studied now to determine just how bad it can be on people. </p>

        <p>Well, other than all the examples you've mentioned, vaccines don't only affect yourself. Forcing people to take the vaccine is obviously ridiculous. And I don't think anyone is trying to force you to get one by law. This is just needlessly overstating a situation to form a negative opinion.</p>

        <p>Whether vaccines only affect me or anyone else is irrelevant in my opinion, if we agree they shouldn't be forced. And all those other things I mentioned do affect others. If you die, your loved ones suffer. If you are using the medical system for any of the above reasons, you're a drain on the system, not in a negative way, that's what it's there for. But think of how clogged the medical industry is because of how many obese people, cancer patients, diabetics etc there are (due to lifestyle choices). </p>
<p>Right now, no one is forcing me to get it. But a lot of employees have already been fired for not getting it, and students from all over the place are being required to get it to keep studying at their college/university. It is in fact being "forced" in that way in many places. </p>
<p>The PM of Canada, Justin Trudeau, is now going back on his word and trying to figure out vaccine identification. The writing is on the wall. It might not be long before forced vaccination becomes a more widespread issue. Imagine you want to go get groceries one day and you aren't allowed in the store because you didn't take the damn scam vaccine. </p>
<p>Again, it has nothing to do with health. I'm not just ranting to form a negative opinion; I'm frustrated that forced vaccines are happening at all, and I sure as hell hope they don't show up where my family and I live.</p>

        <p>Your post was about the government being corrupt, because they respect the rights of people to choose except when it comes to vaccines. Which is false because they do respect that right. They're not forcing anything.</p>
<p>For the businesses, it makes complete sense to have people be vaccinated. It's economically better for them.</p>

        <p>Sorry if I misunderstood you. \^\^'</p>
<p>I believe you said that vaccines weren't about health in your last paragraph, which would mean the government is telling some pretty serious lies. After all, vaccines are supposed to have 1 single purpose; health.</p>
<p>I might have misread that point though. I think you actually meant that forcing vaccines isn't about health. Which would make a lot more sense considering your other points. I still think it's quite a big leap though. It's always a balance between freedoms and public interest. And it seems like freedom is still winning it on the ground of vaccines, just like it is with the other examples you've mentioned. That doesn't mean that health isn't a reason in favor of forced vaccines.</p>

        <p>I'll try to clarify. No worries on the misunderstanding. </p>
<p>Objectively, sure, vaccines exist for the sake of keeping people from getting horribly sick. The idea is to give people immunity in advance. I'd lump that in under "health" in a broad sense.</p>
<p>But my alarm bells start ringing when the people/industry that clearly doesn't give a shit about health in easy-to-do ways, begins telling us that we need a brand new vaccine for a virus that 99.9%+ people survive on their own. Feel me? </p>
<p>Smoking should be illegal. If something else doesn't kill you first, smoking will. But it's perfectly legal. Second hand smoke is even worse. Too bad. </p>
<p>Sugar makes you fat and can cause diabetes. It's addictive and too much of it is far too easily available. </p>
<p>Fast food, etc...</p>
<p>People in positions of power and authority have had ample time to crack down on things in the name of health that would've made golden sense for them to do so. They didn't. Clearly, they don't actually care about the health of people. I mean, you'd have to be a fool to believe they do. Or, they believe we should have the right to choose.</p>
<p>So when those same people now are talking about requiring this pseudo-vaccine? In the name of health? Come on. It's bullshit. And we all know already that politicians get paid off by corporations alllllll the time to pass bills or scrap them.</p>

        <p>Well, as you know governments have to balance freedom and health. Banning sugars or smoking would be absurd, it is your own freedom to choose whether you want that or not. However, smoking may be banned in public places to prevent other people from being effected.</p>
<p>I totally agree with you, having forced vaccines is taking away a part of your freedom, and is a step too far. However, I don't agree that that makes forced vaccines not about health.</p>
<p>&rt; People in positions of power and authority have had ample time to crackdown on things in the name of health that would've made golden sense for them to do so. They didn't. Clearly, they don't actually care about the health of people. I mean, you'd have to be a fool to believe they do. Or, they believe we should have the right to choose.</p>
<p>The government already does a lot to help with these kinds of things. Here, they force cigarette manufacturers to put the consequences of cigarettes on the package. Resulting in pretty nasty packages with pretty nasty imagery of lungs. Likewise, there are regulations in play surrounding healthy food.</p>
<p>The debate around forced vaccines isn't new. You can find articles dating back to ~1940. For all this time, people have discussed the idea, outweighed the benefits for health and the downsides for freedom and chose that freedom won. It really isn't that surprising that the debate is being brought up again, that doesn't mean it isn't about health all of a sudden. </p>
<p>To summarize, your main point seems to be that forced vaccines aren't for health. Because otherwise the government would force other health related things as well. Your argument is greatly weakened by the fact that forced vaccines, just like all the other things you've mentioned, haven't been implemented yet. And that the government is helping with these things in more indirect ways.</p>
<p>As a side note, I've got no clue where you got that 99.9% from. Reports show that the death rate is about 1.8% in the US, which would mean a survival rate of 98.2%. And that's with proper hospitalization. Not that it matters much, there are more factors at play here than just death rates.</p>

        <p>Survival rate is 98.2% if you're over the age of 85. For the rest of us, odds of survival are even higher. The point is, this isn't a scary death rate, and administering fake vaccines in the name of health here is bullshit. </p>
<p>Also, banning smoking would not be absurd, and placing emphasis on public awareness of the effects of sugar rich diets would be a great start at least. </p>

        <p>No, the death rate of people over 75 is actually 17% in the US and 30% in some other countries. It is true that it's lower for people around 18-49, namely 0.15% and this might be where your figure comes from. But on average across all age groups, incorporating the share of that age group in the population, it really is 2.5%. (source: CDC, RIVM). </p>
<p>Regarding the video you linked. They show a complete lack of any knowledge by listing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride">salt</a> as a "experimental &amp; industrial" chemical. Literally <em>table salt</em>. Same goes for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_chloride">potassium chloride</a>. I mean, yeah they're found in fertilizer as well but that doesn't mean salt is dangerous? The alternative solutions they mentioned have been debunked many times before as well. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca because of 5 people who had blood clots. At the time they didn't even know if it was caused by the vaccine. It was found that this was indeed the case. However, the condition was rare, with a 0.000009091% chance of getting it (source: NOS). And the condition is treatable. So it isn't like these cases aren't investigated. In fact, this minor side effect is still being researched extensively.</p>
<p>The entire video is littered with accusations without any substance. This is more trying to be sensational than correct.</p>

        <p>You do you pal. If you believe this is a real pandemic, no one's stopping you from getting your experimental vaccination from daddy government. I'm not sure if you just came here to argue or what, but my point remains unchanged: this vaccine isn't about health.</p>

        <p>I believe you're from NL? Pretty sure that in the Netherlands this would be legally prohibited. The EU states are pretty similar in that matter.</p>

        <p>De jonge heedt advies gevraagd aan een juridisch - ethische commissie om te kijken naar de mogelijkheid tot verplichting. Het werd afgeraden, maar dat ze het proberen is wel een teken aan de wand.</p>

        <p>Jep, het is afgeraden, net zoals in <a href="https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=MMKB08:000080959:mpeg21:a0093">1939</a>, ik zou het niet als een al te groots teken zien.</p>
<p>Het argument is hier overigens dat de vaccinatie niet voor de gezondheid is juist omdat ze voor andere dingen wel rekening houden met de ethische kant, maar voor vaccinaties niet. Als ze je niet forceren om te stoppen met roken bijvoorbeeld, waarom dan wel vaccinaties? Maar ondertussen wordt hier de vaccinatie plicht afgeraden voor precies deze reden.</p>
