    <strong>Has anyone else heard of unused coronavirus tests being sent for testing and coming back with a positive result?</strong>
    <p><p>Several months ago I was speaking to two nurses who, as a test, sent two unused COVID-19 tests to get tested and both came back with a positive result.</p>
<p>Additionally, another woman I knew went to an ER, checked in, but after the wait was going to be longer than she could manage to wait, she left. She then received a letter in the mail saying she had tested positive for coronavirus when she never got tested or saw a doctor.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs experiences like this that make me questionable.</p></p>

        <p>When a government offers money to corporate medical entities for each positive result for each case admitted and up to $40,000 for each death (especially if a ventilator was used)
you can bet your ass that the game is fixed.</p>

        <p>Absolutely 100% correct.  The fact that facts like this has NOT awoken more people to the BS that has been and still is the "pandemic" is beyond sobering.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the test is being run at way too high of a threshold.  It basically throws out 90% false positives and was never meant to be used as a diagnostic at such levels.  It's bunk.</p>

        <p>Yes. I have heard that. And in another vein, my friend, 36F and healthy, decided to get the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù. Two days before she got the vaccine, I had spent about 90 minutes with her (neither of us wore a mask), and she was perfectly fine. I was perfectly fine too. Two days after I saw her,  she took the first dose, and then two days after the first dose, she started feeling really sick. She waited two days before she called the clinic. She went in on the fourth day after the first dose, and she took a rapid test. The rapid test came back positive for covid. They told her to go home and quarantine for 12 days and she should be fine. She quarantined, and then at the end of her quarantine she went back to the clinic to ask for another test (because she wanted a negative test result to return to work) and she was turned down. They told her that there was no point in taking another test because her test could come back as positive for covid for up to three months. (What does THAT mean?) She asked for an antibody test and they said no. They just gave her a ‚Äúreturn to work‚Äù note and sent her on her way. I made her repeat her story to me three times because her story didn‚Äôt make logical sense to me. I made her show me her rapid test result, from after she took the vaccine, and it was indeed positive. She said the people at the clinic told her she probably already had covid when she took the vaccine. I was with her, in close proximity, two days before she got the shot, and neither one of us was sick. I didn‚Äôt get sick at all after seeing her either. Not even a sniffle. I remained perfectly fine. I was around my coworkers after that, and not one person who came near me got sick. Thankfully, my friend is okay now, but I think it was the shot that made her sick and that the test was faulty. Or maybe the test was designed to be faulty? ü§î</p>

        <p>Here in the UK there have been many stories of cross-contamination happening at the places they run the tests, although most of them get buried as soon as they come out, unsurprisingly.</p>
<p>Its basically due to the people working there having little-to-no clinical experience, inadequate training and rediculously high targets to achieve. Causing them to rush and miss-handle samples, or not correctly sanitize equipment etc. This leads to a high number of samples coming back as positive, simply due to the fact that they happened to be processed at the same time as maybe one or two people who did actually have the virus. And of course this effect snowballs when each of the contacts of someone who tests positive then gets told to test themselves and/or isolate.</p>

        <p>Coca-Cola, a papaya, and a goat have all tested "positive." With a high enough cycle threshold, even a tiny hint of contamination in the sample will throw a false positive, which is why tests with high Cts are bullshit. A well-calibrated PCR test still can't differentiate live virus from dead virus bits, but it's only going to show a false positive if you have a large amount of dead fragments (ex. very recent recovery) or lab procedures and contamination control are atrocious instead of slightly imperfect.</p>
