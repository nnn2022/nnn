    <strong>What Are Your Predictions For Tomorrow? (UK)</strong>
    <p><p>Curious to know what my fellow Brits (and anyone interested in what's happening over here) think will happen tomorrow. For those not in the know, that fucking slug Boris (our PM) said ages ago that on June 21st most (if not all) Covid regulations would be "irreversibly" eased. Of course, as predicted, a new variant conveniently came along and the media has been stoking the fear fires for the past month and a half or so. So now because of the ~~Indian~~ fuck sorry, DELTA variant it's all up in the air and a final decision is to be made tomorrow.</p>
<p>I'm a cynical bastard so I'm predicting they're going to pull the "jUsT tWo MoRe wEeKS" (well, they're saying a month) card and keep that going on indefinitely, despite there being hardly any deaths or hospitilizations right now. Cases mean fuck all. Most of the country has had the miracle vaccine they're all gushing over. Literally no reason not to end this bullshit.</p>
<p>What do you all think?</p>
<p>Will it go ahead? Does it even matter if it does?</p>
<p>Will people push back if it is delayed/scrapped?</p>
<p>Tune in tomorrow for the boring and disappointing conclusion.</p></p>

        <p>Going with the previous trends.... They'll go with a two week extension instead of the leaked four weeks.</p>
<p>Only to extend it again after two weeks....</p>

        <p>Problem is they went door to door in the worst areas and no one batted an eyelid. Of course they will get people to get tested they’re brainwashed. Would love to see a breakdown of where the tests are coming from, never gonna happen.</p>

        <p>People give away their freedom so easily. They believe that they will get it back if they give it away without resistance. It doesn't matter how ridiculous the government wants you to behave, people will comply without question. Boris will add another month but it doesn't matter if he adds another 6 because people will still obey. If they say we need another vaccine for the new variant then we can expect new variants=new jabs for ever. The government will know who is the most obedient by which people have had all their vacancies. These will be the ones that governments will target with their next crazy plans.</p>

        <p>You'd hope but in my experience people are very hesitant for whatever reason to admit that there's anything untoward going on behind the scenes. Hopefully this'll be the kick in the nards for them to wake the fuck up.</p>

        <p>Do you know what SickestBiscuit? I’ve just downloaded facebook after a long hiatus with the view of doing an informative video, hoping to wake a few folk up. Well it’s deleted again as my feed is just full of people praising the (most likely false flag) climate protests here in Cornwall), or saying they’re covid vaccinated, or talking about nothing in particular. I’m not going to bother. How utterly depressing. I had a 4 month period where I was posting heavily evidences that prove the government are lying, and no doubt people just got sick of the sight of me. That’s why I deleted it.</p>

        <p>Its been over 450 days since the first "two week lockdown", i seriously doubt people will wake up this time. Imo these sheep have dug themselves into their ideological trench and by not trying to see covid for what it really is (a means for the elites to power-grab everything in sight), their only recourse is to blindly listen to authority because they have no real sense of free thinking.</p>
<p>I truely wish for Boris to lift it completely and stick to his word but im very doubtful.</p>

        <p>I seriously hope they ease restrictions. I can see there being a lot more backlash than in the past if they do extend them. Or people saying fuck it and gathering anyways. </p>
<p>However, I dare not get my hopes up as I can see them pulling this extension to bribe more 18-25 y/o to get the vax. "We canNoT pOsSiblY eaSe reSriCtiONs wHen tHe DeaDlY deLtA variEnT tHreAtenS oUr YounG peOpLe."
I can only hope that it has the opposite effect and proves that getting vaxxed will not actually give you your freedoms back (which is the reason most people my age seem to be getting it).</p>

        <p>21st June is a red herring if you ask me, the fact is that the government has already voted through emergency powers for itself until September. That along with the extension of the furlough scheme told me several months ago how much faith they had in this roadmap to begin with. </p>
<p>If you’ll remember, last year saw the narrative go from “eat out to help out” to “drink up and fuck off” around September. Cases will rise as the seasons change (probably misdiagnosed flu as we all know), fear will probably be mongered around a new super scary variant that dodges vaccines, just in time to vote themselves more emergency powers through and it’ll never be admitted that perhaps if the vaccine has an effective half life of less than a year then it maybe isn’t actually very good, as we’re all told to take booster jabs. </p>
<p>Lots of conjecture and a lot of reverse doomerism I know, but we must remain vigilant. We aren’t free until the emergency powers are revoked and even then we now know the flimsy pretext under which they can be voted through. Beware of local and national authorities offhandedly declaring “climate emergencies” or “cyber emergencies”. As we’ve seen, it amounts to an excuse for large-scale money laundering, media manipulation and coercion.</p>

        <p>Genuine question, not trying to argue, what censorship? I get that you have a right to question what’s happening and why they haven’t been completely clear about everything, and I just want everyone to have the information that’s out there, and they can make your own choices from that. But when you cause harm to others or cause any consequences for those actions, that’s on you. I mean this respectfully.

        <p>Mate, have you not heard about what's going on in the CovidVaccinated subreddit? People post their side effects and their posts get removed almost straight away. I've seen quite a few posts from people on here that have basically been banned from that subreddit just for trying to get help. I think it's far more dangerous that the people you support are just outright downplaying and censoring anyone who's had a bad experience with the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I haven’t seen it, no, that doesn’t sound right. And these people went about trying to get help the right way? If they were having regular side effects like soreness, that’s normal, but anything severe shouldn’t be deleted. I guess the semi-good thing is that the number of people that have had really bad reactions to the vaccine has been astronomically low compared to how many people got it.</p>

        <p>Hm. Some of those symptoms may be from something else, we can’t really be sure it was from the vaccine just because they got it recently, but again, can’t be too sure. Also, we don’t really know the longer term affects of COVID itself, let alone the vaccine. But for me, since the vaccine does do it’s job and I haven’t had any reactions myself I’m good with it. If you’re not, that’s fine, just know all of the information.</p>

        <p>I agree. Things would be so much better if we could just be civil about this, even with contrasting opinions. lol I’m being kind of a hypocrite, I was being an ass earlier</p>

        <p>Honestly just amazed to have a semi-civil conversation with someone from Covidiots. You're right though, things would be much better if both sides could have a civil discussion; unfortunately our side is often shouted down and demonized by the media and the more hardcore doomers.</p>

        <p>Glad we could have this conversation, I don’t want to think of it as sides, but people have separated themselves. I’m not considerably right or left wing, I like to think independently and decide what I think myself on certain issues.</p>

        <p>Ah, I see you haven’t paid any attention to the doctors and scientists who have been punished for speaking out - to the point of losing their licenses, or “voluntarily” stopping legitimate covid research. Censorship in scientific research has long been a growing problem, and it skyrocketed this past year. </p>
<p>If you’d done your own research this past year, using medical journals and publications, you’d have 
 come across at least a few clear signs of censorship or suppression of dissent. For one example, two experts in infectious diseases wrote an article discussing the available evidence on masks that concluded that there was no evidentiary basis for universal mask mandates. The publisher was swarmed with demands to take the article down (even though nothing in the article was refuted - it was all objectively correct with sources provided); their compromise was to leave the article up but have the authors issue a statement that essentially said: </p>
<p>&rt; Even though we clearly showed there is no evidentiary basis for these mandates, of course mandates are good and everyone should wear masks. </p>
<p>If that sentence doesn’t flip you out, then you don’t know what science it - a scientist who finds no evidentiary basis for X yet nonetheless recommends X isn’t a scientist, because scientists are bound by the evidence. </p>
<p>My personal favorite was a peer-reviewed study on the use of masks in dental practices to prevent transmission of infections. The study was published well before covid and, like literally every RCT ever done on the use of masks to prevent transmission, found no effect. The dental journal that published the article removed the study and replaced it with a message that the study was “no longer relevant.” Not disproven, not discredited … just no longer relevant. </p>
<p>And that’s just off the top of my head. There have been countless instances of scientists and medical professionals being punished or silenced in some way, as well as evidence being removed from various sites because it is not helpful to the chosen narrative. The number of scientists and medical pros who observe this environment and choose to self-censor to avoid the inevitable punishment is likely far greater. </p>
<p>Oh, I was banned from the CovidVaccinated subreddit. My crime? In a discussion on the legal status of the covid vaccines in the US, I wrote a comment that: </p>
<ul>
<li>linked directly to an FDA webpage, and </li>
<li>provided a verbatim quote from that webpage</li>
</ul>
<p>The comment contained absolutely nothing else: just an FDA link and FDA quote from that link. I was banned for “misinformation.”</p>
