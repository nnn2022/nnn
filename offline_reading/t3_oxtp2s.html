    <strong>Calling them the Majority discredits the truth.</strong>
    <p><p>I think we should stop calling them the majority because they are not gonna take it seriously if we call them the ''majority'' i also feel that's not really true either and let me explain why,</p>
<p>I live in the netherlands and back in 2020 the msm was publishing polls for lockdowns , the majority voted no against it but suddenly few days later on tv they were twisting it and lie that the majority actually wants lockdown and suddenly we were in lockdown , also with mask the majority of people voted against mask in those polls but suddenly few days later the msm start twistin it and everybody had to mask up or police would use violence against you , that's how far they were going.</p>
<p>Also look at the protest , The msm always talk about like it's a few hundred people but when you look at the crowd it looks like millions of people standing up for their freedom and rights , Millions of people and that crowd is even bigger than people dying by covid! , that doesn't make sense</p>
<p>The government try to shutdown a peaceful protest for freedom as quick as possible with much violence as possible lucky they are not shooting civilians yet , but it is allowed to protest peaceful for any woke movement you can think of. </p>
<p>On social media it's easily to make it look like the majority actually wants forced vaccination , lockdowns , masks , vaccination passport or any other fascist mandate you can think of.</p>
<p>Just put in some bots , Let celebrities do the lying , The Politicians do the lying , Let the pharmaceuticals and virologist do the propaganda , Hype the people up that talks like they want it all and silence everybody that speaks up so that the majority of people that wants to speak up can't and suddenly it looks like everybody agrees with eachother.</p>
<p>And even if we may not be majority we shouldn't call these people the majority because in their mindset they think they are right because they think the majority agrees with him/her so they think our statements don't count because they think we are the minority.</p>
<p>The msm is also being spam attacked with comments of people standing up on youtube </p>
<p>Even if they know the majority knows the government is lying , they will still keep on lying because to make it believable you got to keep on lying , it's a typical fascist strategy.</p>
<p>We live in a matrix and what the majority/minority thinks can be easily manipulated by a few.</p></p>

        <p>This goes against every I've seen and hear in real life, which is mostly support and compliance from people who wear masks, gotten the vaccine (I see literally no less than 20 people at a time in the lobby at my local Walgreens, in the "vaccine" section), want more lockdowns, etc.</p>
<p>But let's suppose you are right. The majority know the government is lying and secretly or not so secretly want no more lockdowns or vaccinations or any of that. Then why aren't there protests in the millions or billions? Why isn't there more outcry in public? Why don't people shed the masks especially when there's unmasked people in the vicinity? Why are there no larger efforts to prevent this tyranny from more than a few doctors and other "experts"? Why is there less traffic and going out, and more masks and fear since the Delta variant bullshit started?</p>
<p>I don't know, I just don't see the world people on here describe when they claim the majority hate this. I don't even live in a "blue" state, it's more "purple" with a sizeable conservative base, and I still see compliance and support even from those folks.</p>

        <p>If you give the bad people the spotlight the good people will be silenced , Calling them the majority also has a psychological effect and when you think you are the majority why should you take the minority seriously? because that's how the mindset is trained, we are always believed that the majority counts and there's a lot of tools to give you the feeling of being the ''majority'' , i also feel like it discredit the points you try to make when calling yourself the minority, there's also a lot of fear going on and fear is also what stops a lot of people for doing anything , the easily manipulated no matter if it's minority or majority will always follow orders like a good sheep and the good sheep will always get the spotlight by the few shepherds</p>

        <p>I really think it depends on where you are at. I live in the county north of Houston and nearly no one is wearing a mask. I went to the city for shopping, about a 30 mile distance, and people are wearing them outside like complete morons.</p>
<p>I also had a huge vaccine center 2 miles down the road from me for months. It was manned by the National Guard and creepy as hell. The thing was always dead empty. It was the easiest thing in the world for all of us to get the vaccine, but in my neighborhood there is no possible way the majority did. Now it may be the opposite 30 miles away, but how do we know which is the actual majority without the MSM?</p>

<p>That's indeed creepy in the city I live at two restaurants have been replaced by a test center but it's almost always empty everyday, it was more crowded when those restaurants were open those two restaurants that got replaced was always full with people sad they had to be replaced, it almost seems like every time a restaurant has to shutdown it gets replaced by a test center most people are maskless and there are only few that still wears mask and the ones I see there are always the few that still are afraid to put off their mask.</p>
