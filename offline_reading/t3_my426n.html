    <strong>It is wrong to assume science to be correct</strong>
    <p><p>Science is a <strong>process,</strong> not the absolute truth. Furthermore, recently the process has been corrupted.</p>
<p>Money decides what gets published and the current paradigm is the one that benefits most the most important people. No amount of researcher integrity can help when the big shots (journal editors, public health organization heads etc.) are paid off to block certain papers getting through, or gaining traction. So there is lot of papers some are great and right on the money, some are off, and some are deliberately misleading.</p>
<p>The biggest randomized trials are only possible with money from big pharma, and these papers get published in the most influential journals. When big pharma is involved, it is only about drugs they have patents on, and make look like these drugs work even when results actually suck. Why would they sped money promoting medicine with expired patents, that actually work? That would ruin their prospects of benefiting from any ongoing situation.</p>
<p>So the corporation, emergent thing from human society, has become more powerful than humans themselves, and wreck havoc on us, out of our control. (Same way the 'Gene survival machines' called humans have started to behave in harmful ways to the genes that created them, say for example smoking).</p>
<p>In the best situation the process would be as described below, and it would still take generation per step, as many people just love to resist change. The process is by default reluctant to advance, and it is easy to see how it is possible to hinder and derail the process on purpose. There are increasingly numerous forces to A) Introduce faults (disinformation) and B) resist correction. If and when faults become part of the generally accepted, it is hard and slow to fix.</p>
<p>Paradigm shift according to Kuhn:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>0. Pre-science</strong> – This is a pre-stage, where the field/discipline has no workable paradigm to successfully guide its work.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>1. Normal Science</strong> – The normal step, where the field has a scientifically based model of understanding that works.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>2. Model Drift</strong> – The model of understanding starts to drift, due to accumulation of anomalies and phenomenon the model cannot explain.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>3. Model Crisis</strong> – The Model Drift becomes so  excessive that the model is broken. It can no longer serve as a reliable  guide to problem-solving. Attempts to patch the model up to make it  work fail. The field is in anguish<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>4. Model Revolution</strong> – This begins when serious candidates for a new model emerge. It’s a revolution because the new model is so <em>radically different</em> from the old one<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>5. Paradigm Change</strong> – A single new paradigm emerges  and the field changes from the old to the new paradigm. When this step  ends the new paradigm becomes the new Normal Science and the Kuhn Cycle  is complete</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Additional obscure rant:</p>
<p>We are the cells of these behemoths (nations, corporations, religions, ideologies etc.) There is no common good or truth the corporations care about. There is no common good or truth the other organizations care about either. These things do not think or feel, but in evolutionary terms (memetics) they have agendas and are 'fighting' each other. We are experiencing a new mutation (called corporation) becoming a dominant and will have to live in a world dictated by them, like ants live in presence of us.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: Lol, just about the next post to this rant is:</p>
<p>&rt;The pharmaceutical industry is pouring resources into the growing political fight over generic coronavirus vaccines.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Newly filed disclosure forms from the first quarter of 2021 show that  over 100 lobbyists have been mobilized to contact lawmakers and members  of the Biden administration, urging them to oppose a proposed temporary  waiver on intellectual property rights by the World Trade Organization  that would allow generic vaccines to be produced globally.</p>
