    <strong>New covid bot campaign against us to watch out for..</strong>
    <p><p>They are starting a new trend to call real people like us misinformation trolls then link some crap about "how we are profiting off spreading misinformation about covid."  </p>
<p>I saw this on facebook. Yes i hate FB at this point but like posting pictures of me at packed bars to piss off covid idiots. Anyways, guy had a background picture of my city to act like he lived there.  But i clicked his profile and his last check in was South Africa. So i called him out on it and ask who is paying him.  </p>
<p>Instead of defending himself he either blocked me or deleted the account right away since he was caught.  I expected some BS response how he traveled there for some bs reason.  But he panicked right away.</p>
<p>So this is a new bot/shill trend to say we are " misinformation trolls profiting off this."  Basically, deflecting what they are doing.  Same with asianhate and all that other crap they try to get trending with bots then morons actually fall for it.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks for the warning.  I can’t figure out how any of us would profit from this though.  All the profit comes from the masks and vaccines.  Maybe because our business is at full capacity?  Whoa!  Can’t have that</p>

        <p>LOL! They had some 'study' show we are more interested in facts &amp; research. </p>
<p>Although, I'd love to know how I can "profit" from being against the 'new normal'.</p>
