    <strong>My father-in-law’s actions have made me so anti-lockdown.</strong>
    <p><p>My father-in-law (FIL) was a lifelong smoker. My fiancé always tried to get him to quit. He always told his dad he’d end up having a stroke. My FIL never listened. He ended up moving several hours away and up in the mountains. He never went to the doctor except for when my fiancé or one of his siblings made him go. His blood pressure was dangerously high. The doctor gave him a blood pressure medication to take. My FIL refused to take it. It was a pill every day, it was not hard at all. He went down to my SIL’s house in January of last year and had a stroke there. I remember a week before it happened my fiancé was on the phone with him and was demanding he take his medication or he’s going to have a stroke. My MIL has severe dementia and no nursing home will take her because she’s aggressive. My FIL put all of his kids in the position to take care of them and deal with the consequences of his actions and he didn’t care. His children and their partners are having to put their lives on hold to take care of them.</p>
<p>This is why lockdowns enrage me. It’s so similar to what happened with my FIL but on a much larger scale. One of the major comorbidities of COVID is obesity. For most people that is something they can fix. It may be hard and I understand but it’s doable. I don’t like to pick on fat people but I can’t help but be upset now. So many of these “healthy young people” who are hospitalized with COVID are morbidly obese. Because those people didn’t take responsibility for themselves, the rest of us have to deal with it. I know a lot of other conditions that make COVID worse can’t be changed, like old age. I get it but obesity is a big one that can be changed. </p>
<p>Are you seeing the parallels between my situation and these lockdowns? These people who want us to lockdown remind me of my FIL. They indulge in unhealthy behaviors like my FIL, then something bad happens to them and act like we’re the selfish ones for wanting to live our lives. My FIL expects everyone to drop everything to take care of him. My fiancé and I are getting married in February and we’ll hopefully have our first baby soon after. My FIL wants us to put a baby off so we can take care of him since we can’t do both at the same time. My fiancé straight up told him he needs to move on with his life. My fiancé is 41 this month and he’s ready to be a father. I’m 26 so we still do have many years left but we want a baby now. This reminds me of people telling others to put other major things off because “wE’rE iN a PaNdEmIc.” We can’t put our lives on hold for others.</p>
<p>We’re not responsible for their actions and we shouldn’t have to deal with the consequences. This absolutely infuriates me.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, he is. They are already family and they are already married in each other's eyes. They don't have to be LEGALLY married to consider themselves married already.</p>

        <p>This is partly also why Healthcare for all doesn't make sense. Some people are more sick than others. If I take care of myself and get sick less often, why should I have to pay the same amount of someone that does not take care of their health? Something to consider anyways</p>

        <p>Help? Sure. Drive him to appointments, pick up his prescriptions, grab his groceries when you shop. That's "help." And if he demands that you do those things when he wants them done, not when they fit your schedule, or criticizes the way they're done, or restricts your life to accomplish them, then Hard No.</p>
<p>OP is describing "taking care of him," and that's a different story. Often that means moving him in, and then assuming the role of caretaker/housekeeper/servant. His life goes back to normal, and hers becomes full of restrictions.</p>
