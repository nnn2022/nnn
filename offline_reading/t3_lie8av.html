    <strong>[THREAD] Your facebook memes suck, let's have an intelligent and sourced discussion.</strong>
    <p><p>Your facebook memes suck. </p>
<p>We are looked at like crazy people for believing that lockdowns don't work, that the PCR test generated COVID-19 numbers are inflated, and that all the new regulations and restrictions being generated out of this crisis are invalid and inherently bad for us. People look at us like this because we share youtube videos, facebook memes and oftentimes actual misinformation. Anecdotal evidence, assertions of "dO YouR OwN ReSeARcH", and memes do not work to have civil discussions and oftentimes only serve to make both parties dig their heels in and further divide. </p>
<p>I propose we have a source based discussion surrounding these areas and a push towards calm and intelligent discussion with people rather than vitriol, hate, and all out name calling, bashing and arguing. We haven't quite lost the ability to have a civil disagreement and I for one am sick of seeing these things play out on this very sub. </p>
<p><strong>LOCKDOWNS:</strong></p>
<p>Lockdowns are hindering people across the globe. Let's not even go into the government overreach as it seems some people believe that what happens in Australia and China are a net positive. Instead, let's discuss the outcomes of these lockdowns for the people. </p>
<p><a href="https://gloria.tv/post/NGCjACeyupY92oANNmpWhqwoj">The World Health organization does not recommend lockdowns as a primary control method for the SARS-COV-2 virus</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/462319362/A-Doctor-a-Day-Letter-Signed">Here's a letter signed by thousands of doctors warning of the consequences of large scale lockdowns</a></p>
<p><a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-thousands-lost-cancer-surgery-covid-.html">Thousands of lives could be lost due to cancer patients not being able to access the care they need</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wellbeingtrust.org/news/new-wbt-robert-graham-center-analysis-the-covid-pandemic-could-lead-to-75000-additional-deaths-from-alcohol-and-drug-misuse-and-suicide/">Upwards of 75,000 Americans are expected to die deaths of despair or drug/alcohol abuse or suicide due to the lockdowns</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31647-0/fulltext">265 million people are expected to be thrown into food insecurity due to the lockdowns</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31647-0/fulltext">125,000 children are expected to die of malnutrition due to the lockdowns</a></p>
<p>What other sources do we have that prove that not only do lockdowns not work, but are indeed more dangerous than the COVID-19 disease? </p>
<p><strong>PCR Tests:</strong></p>
<p>The polymerase chain reaction tests are not designed to properly diagnose a viral infection. These tests have been used around the globe to determine if someone has the presence of the SARS-COV-2 virus. </p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/06/27/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/#2">PCR tests are scientifically meaningless</a></p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/12/18/who-finally-admits-pcr-tests-create-false-positives/">The World Health Organization has admitted that the PCR tests can produce false results</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-sequencing-idUSKBN29R2NR">“It is important to note that detecting viral material by PCR does not indicate that the virus is fully intact and infectious, i.e. able to cause infection in other people. The isolation of infectious virus from positive individuals requires virus culture methods. These methods can only be conducted in laboratories with specialist containment facilities and are time consuming and complex.”</a></p>
<p>This link is a Reuters fact check article proving my point about the PCR tests. The claims that it is the "gold standard" are refuted in the previous link <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/06/27/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/#2">here</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/risk-false-results-curative-sars-cov-2-test-covid-19-fda-safety-communication">The FDA is even admitting that the PCR tests can be providing false results</a></p>
<p>Now, the FDA is saying that there's a risk of false negatives; however, how could a test provide false results and not have both of the potential results be false? </p>
<p><strong>Vaccines:</strong></p>
<p>The vaccines that have been approved for emergency use by the FDA are wildly untested. You may think they're tested; however, the small number of people in all the stages of testing prove that these are experimental, and that since these companies have complete <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html">liability protection</a> including all the way up to the pharmacist giving you the vaccine.  </p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/11/26/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modernas-95-effective-vaccines-lets-be-cautious-and-first-see-the-full-data/">British Medical Journal points out that  “a relative risk reduction is being reported, not absolute risk reduction, which appears to be less than 1%.”</a></p>
<p>Even mainstream publications like <em>Scientific American</em> were <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-risks-of-rushing-a-covid-19-vaccine/">compelled to note</a> back in June of this year that there are reasons for concern over the way the COVID-19 vaccines are being rushed to market</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There's a ton of more research to be done. My point with this post is to prove that there is a source based, civil way to discuss these things in today's information world. If you're passionate about these things, research them and have civil discussion with your neighbors. </p>
<p>We are all humans. We have been forced into this social media frenzy of arguing with people and believing that we have enemies in other fellow humans. </p>
<p>Every person you meet knows something you don't know. Let's use this to our advantage as a global civilization. </p>
<p>I am also open to be proven wrong. Please prove me wrong, I want to enter into a discussion about these things and not just circle jerk ourselves with bullshit memes and un-sourced youtube videos. We as a community of humans on the internet are better than this. Act like it.</p></p>

        <p>I’m in, but I disagree with the tactic of ignoring government overreach in the interest of moving the discussion forward. It’s important to note that no matter how infectious or deadly this virus is or any future iterations of it are, we should remain completely against lockdowns and any further restrictions on our freedom. We’re granting way too much assumption of basic good will on the part of the decision makers, and they absolutely have not earned that benefit of the doubt.</p>

        <p>While I agree that the government overreach is unbearable and a severe threat to our liberty as humans I was mainly gearing this post towards people who are skeptics of our morality and research capabilities. </p>
<p>The loudest people in favor of the lockdowns are touting "listen to the science" let's give them science to listen to, and then help them get to the main point of government overreach. </p>
<p>The media lied, the government lied. The problem is that these people have believed it. In order to prove a point, that point must be made in a language they understand and can trust.</p>

        <p>THANK YOU.</p>
<p>While it isn’t our job to clarify our position and the reasoning behind it to people who are never going to change their mind, the few extremists and Q Anon conspirators give us a bad name as they are typically the loudest. They really do have the worst memes.</p>
<p>Being constantly at-the-throat of these people and just calling them “sheep” and throwing insults doesn’t really make us look any better, it kind of just makes us look ignorant and insane even though the majority of us aren’t and that’s WHY we’re here. That’s why we shouldn’t engage with trolls on here. They’re trying to trap us into giving them free entertainment on Covidiots and NNNN and we’re only proving to be exactly what they think we are.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the links, I will use those in the future.</p>

        <p>While I see your point I disagree. The masks are a symptom of over testing, inflated COVID numbers and media fear mongering. The reason we were told to wear the masks was due to the uptick in cases, which started because of the PCR testing that was used a gold standard.</p>

<p>It may be worth it to have civil conversation, and provide sourced links and studies that prove masks are ineffective. People like you who can't articulate a point using proof are the exact reason why people look at us the way they do. Do different things to get different results.</p>

        <p>No 'asymptomatic transmission' = No cuckmuzzle brigade.</p>
<p>First they need to prove asymptomatic transmission.</p>
<p>Then they need to prove masks are effective to stop the spread.</p>
<p>I am yet to see proof of either so I don't wear a cuckmuzzle. Pretty easy logic. </p>

        <p>Agree. Well, kinda. </p>
<p>For me this was never about facts (yes, I know how that sounds) but about ethics. <em>It’s wrong to force someone else to do something different because you think it’s a good idea.</em> It may or may not positively affect this or that metric, but that’s another issue.</p>
<p>If you get bogged down in quoting study vs counter study, and neglect framing this as an issue of <em>personal liberty</em>, you are getting further and further away from <em>the point</em>.</p>

        <p>This is very true! The reason we bring these up is because we are so far gone from the fact that our personal liberties have been taken away from us. People are fine with that. We have people who even make fun of "muh rights" as if that's not a valid argument. Personal liberties are indeed important. </p>
<p>Since we are so far gone the only thing I can think to do is to educate people on <em>how</em> the reduction of our personal liberties can be used as propaganda and actually hurt the people they're claiming to be protecting by following our lying government.</p>

        <p>This might seem a bit off topic but I feel like people who talk about <em>personal liberty</em> or <em>freedom</em> are about 200 years behind modern thought. We just don't live in those times anymore. Back then a person could do anything he/she/it pleases because any one persons actions had almost no effect on anyone else.</p>
<p>These days we're much more interconnected and less self-reliant, any small thing we do will impact many, possibly millions. The society has changed and thus the social contract has changed.</p>
<p>So a modern definition of personal liberty would be:
&rt;Personal liberty definition is - the freedom of the individual to do as he pleases limited only by the authority of politically organized society to regulate his action to secure the public health, safety, or morals or of other recognized social interests.<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/personal%20liberty" title="personal liberty">1</a></p>

        <p>The first 4 months of this I painstakingly listed out multiple sources for everything and would source videos of press conferences and timestamp them and share with doomers in good faith. </p>
<p>They ignored everything that I provided because it's not actually about science for them.  If doomers actually cared about the science they would be doing their own research and all this information isn't hard to find.  Much of it, like fatality rates, underlying condition data, policy changes that impact death counts, etc, is available directly from the CDC website.</p>
<p>It's a good thought, but it's not worth trying to educate dumb and malicious people.</p>

<p>While I see your point about people not going to listen anyways the more we educate ourselves the better we will be for it, I guess. Thanks for your input! I'd love to see what research you've done other than the CDC website which I have scoured and found the same things you have, probably.</p>

        <p>I feel a bit the same way. I can only calmly show people the facts from credible (most often government) sources and have them ignore every bit of it and still mock, shame, and discriminate against me for so long. I did it for months on end. </p>
<p>"That's bunk science"</p>
<p>"That's an old study, it's been disproven"</p>
<p>"Well, the top scientists are still telling us to interpret it another way, and I listen to SCIENCE" (&lt;&lt; the most ironic of all since they're listening to a person, not the actual science itself)</p>
<p>"Even if it doesn't work, it's not that hard to just put a mask on and if everyone would have then the government probably would have lifted everything by now"</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p>At this point, I share data (most often from cdc or nih sources), but if someone is going to STILL treat me like I'm an ignorant piece of shit after that... after a whole fucking year of it it's pretty damn hard to not mirror that attitude somewhat.</p>

        <p>I appreciate not only writing but the references involved, but that's the problem - you are assuming baselines of rational discussion that frankly isn't how public policy nor discourse for the plebs is decided.</p>
<p>I tend to look upon modern politics in america as different interest groups and whichever one can scream the loudest and attract the most attention / power wins. In such a circumstance attaching to a fear and harnessing it will convince far more people than any rational discussion will.</p>
<p>Your framework was the general one used before the advent of modern advertising - partially thanks to Edward Bernays, and partially thanks to the Germans who created the impetus for the first large propaganda campaign that helped win world war one, and demonstrated the power of manipulating the american mind to bernays.  The german example in world war two only reinforced the methods and validity of the tactics used.</p>
<p>I had thought the traditional media would be phased out soon, and hopefully discussion would be more intelligent and relevant - but it has not, and given now new media is now being censored i don't see it as any "change" to the existing propaganda model either.</p>
<p>Meaning pr will be base, manipulated people through the basest of emotions / desires, and no one will calll others on their lying or blatant misinformation unless it is tactticly beneficial to their side to do so.  truth - whether it existed at all in the first place -is a luxury no one can afford it seems, with corona hysteria kind of demonstrating that.</p>
<p>baudrillard's notion that the gulf war did not take place was beautifully prescient.</p>
<p>i'd recommend edward bernays book called "propaganda" which is available on libgen for free - (<a href="https://libgen.is">libgen.is</a>) - its around 100 years old, but still valid and relevant. (applying psychoanalytic methods to advertising)</p>

        <p>Bravo!! Yes, I am hoping that humans as a whole will have rational discussions; however, I can admit that any hope of that has basically been defeated. We can even look at this thread as an example of people simply giving up having rational discussions and discourse with people who share different opinions. </p>
<p>I have not read "Propaganda" fully; however, I have skimmed and am familiar with Bernays' work. He was a brilliant man and I am under the impression he feels the same way about his work as  Robert Oppenheimer did about his monstrous creation as Bernays has done the same thing to the human brain. </p>
<p>I agree. Traditional media is done for, and journalism has taken a turn over the last decade or two into clickbaity articles to gain traction on social media and generate clicks and ad revenue. This is probably also thanks to Bernays' work. </p>
<p>I have actually been thinking about WW1 and how it pertains to this crisis for a while. It's the same framework of war profiteering just with completely different pretenses. Raytheon is to be replaced by Pfizer and Moderna with the banks all playing the same exact role. </p>
<p>Regarding the vaccine rollout I cannot help but think of <a href="https://www.farmersalmanac.com/parmentier-made-potatoes-popular-28537">potatoes</a>. The entry in the scarcity playbook was entered into our minds far before the rollout even happened. Journalism and politicians are basically just advertising wings of the same bird. </p>
<p>Thank you for your input, it is great to see someone who actually knows a little bit about history and can see through the lens of that knowledge while looking at today's world.</p>

        <p>The problem with this nowadays is finding what you would call “credible sources” actually speaking the truth. Now that censorship on the internet has increased tenfold - a lot of articles or videos that go against their mainstream narrative get taken down and deleted for good. </p>
<p>Once you realize that every single media outlet (other than social media I believe, but that is also dominated by a select few tech giants) from radio to tv is all owned by the same 6 companies which are owned by the same 1-2 families. Those few families that run the world, also write the narrative. And nowadays you have to do a lot more digging (than even 10 years ago when I first fell down the “conspiracy rabbit hole”) to find the truth, which most people simply don’t want to do.</p>
<p>They would rather read headlines or believe what they’re told via radio and television. Unfortunately, i believe it’s only going to get harder to find the truth from what the masses would consider “credible sources”. These “credible sources” would rather just cash in on the illusion of left vs right bullshit, or the $cience all while attempting to divide us in the process.</p>
