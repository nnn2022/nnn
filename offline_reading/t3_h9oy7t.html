    <strong>Contact tracing whistleblower describes what the measures really mean</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFUyZWw7qoc</p>
<p>This is what is coming to all of us.  The person in this video is a whistleblower who took the contact tracing course and shows how all this talk of 'voluntary' measures is rubbish.  'Voluntary' quarantine backed up by a police order where you can be fined or even imprisoned for disobeying it is not voluntary.  I believe this person is based in Washington state - I am from the UK and our government is already pushing hard for a very similar thing.</p>
<p>I urge you all to resist this as hard as you can.  The update for contact tracing has already been pushed to all Apple / Android phones, so if you use a smartphone I would urge you to leave your phone at home, and buy an old 'dumb' phone to carry with you while you are outside, as there is absolutely no guarantee that it is not running without your permission, if you have bluetooth turned off, the API is embedded at the OS-level.  For a detailed look and why this is bad, and why contact tracing is not 'anonymous' and how this enables the most granular population surveillance and control grid ever envisioned in human history, I'd recommend reading this detailed breakdown:</p>

        <p>Called it.</p>
<p>A lot of people have been shrugging this off, saying "If one of these guys shows up, I'll just blow them off". Nope. Not that easy. They're going to hound you, forcibly quarantine you, etc. Even worse, others are claiming that if you get quarantined at one point, then come into contact with another suspected COVID positive, you could go back into quarantine <strong>again</strong> even if you did get sick and test positive for antibodies.</p>

        <p>Why is it escalating? The cases are down, the hospitalizations are way down, we never overwhelmed the hospitals. Things are opening back up. Is this an extinction burst or its it still going to get worse? Things are getting more complicatedly strict than they were when shit was peaking.</p>

        <p>Because it hurts.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm more worried about contact tracing and increased surveillance than any other aspect of this whole fiasco. Oh, and also potential attempts to force/coerce unwanted medical treatments on individuals and separate the infected/exposed from their families.</p>

        <p>I'm extremely worried about this, as well.  Seeing how China is rounding people up and throwing them into forced quarantine is making me fear that we may be headed down the same path here if we don't do something fast.  I can't believe how quickly life has gone downhill.  It's beyond depressing and I really don't know how we get out of this.  I rarely even bother leaving the house anymore because everything that has reopened sucks with these restrictions in place.</p>

        <p>There is a thread in one of our subreddits about the contact tracing app that has been/will be pushed to all of our phones. When I checked my android, sure enough, there it was. </p>
<p>Someone had posted a video about how to successfully uninstall that, so I did.</p>
<p>It was bizarre that I had no idea how long it had been on my phone. No notification at all.</p>
<p>I turned of my location and my bluetooth, I don't take my phone with me when I go out any more. I am trying to get in the habit of doing these things and being ok with it.</p>
<p>This is another big reason why I am not returning to my former profession. I would be working very closely with others and would really be a sitting duck for someone I work with as a client or colleague to decide to get tested and test positive. Poof, there goes my personal freedom and my privacy, such as it is.</p>

        <p>I've bought a dumb phone (Nokia 105 that doesn't even have wifi or bluetooth) and a pay as you go sim card to carry with me while I'm out, I'm keeping my old phone only at home and getting rid of the data plan contract since I don't need it, it will only ever be used for wifi.  Only annoying thing is I'll need to carry a seperate mp3 player now for music rather than having an all-in-one device.  </p>
<p>It still doesn't fully protect me from this shit, since I have other bluetooth enabled devices in my house and if this becomes mandatory complete with GPS location logging which I'm almost certain at some point in the future it will, if someone from outside comes into the house with a bluetooth-enabled device, I could still be 'flagged' for quarantine.  I fully expect this to happen, I guess at that point I'll have to tell people not to bring phones into my house or something!  I am planning on leaving the country if there is somewhere that is not enforcing this shit though anyway.</p>

        <p>I guess my biggest thing on this is that anyone who has more than a remote chance of dying from this is far too old to even own a cell phone, so why are they pushing it out to all 20-40 year olds? Surely can’t be what’s necessary to “keep us safe”. Seems wrong. Just give me the opt out option.</p>

        <p>It's an API that a government-sponsored app will eventually use.  What you said is entirely correct for now and I have said so elsewhere in this thread - it does require an app and doesn't do anything by itself.  The app itself will determine what happens with anonymised tokens exchanged over bluetooth with other phones around you - so if the government decides the app should send GPS coordinates and other non-anonymised data to centralised database along with the tokens, then there is the control grid, right there.  I strongly believe that eventually the app will be disposed of and this will be a default 'feature' in the iOS / Android OS that cannot be deactivated and eventually be mandatory.  If you think this is stupid, then ask yourself if 6 months ago you would have believed someone who told you that wearing a mask has become compulsory in some supposedly free Western democracies such as the UK where I live.</p>
<p>If you want to inform yourself of the dangers of this, you can read this blog by privacy expert Jaap-Henk Hoepman which breaks down the GACT API in detail and how it enables everything I've just stated.</p>

        <p>They don’t notify you at all.  Basically, when your phone sees another phone, you get a random ID from that phone.  If the person that owns that phone gets infected, their number gets put in the list that is sent to your phone.  Your phone compares it’s contact list with the infected list.  No data is sent to any server.</p>

        <p>Yes it does, and it only furthers my point. You said this is not a contact tracing API, but an exposure notification API that notifies no one about anything, while the article you linked to very clearly states that the API is for contact tracing purposes and the app would notify people of COVID exposure. Which I would expect of an exposure notification app. However, you said there is a huge difference between a contact tracing API and an exposure notification API, while the article you linked to uses the terms rather interchangeably. You also claim that no data is sent to any server, while the article says data is indeed sent to a central server upon notificationcof exposure. Your source seems to contradict many of your statements.</p>

        <p>Yes, the idiots in the media use the terms interchangeably.  They literally cannot even get simple terms correct.  </p>
<p>But just look at how the thing WORKS.  It isn't tracking where everyone has been on some central server.  It is just a simple way to track exposure.</p>

        <p>If the media responsible for the article are idiots who literally cannot even get simple terms correct, why are you promoting them as a source of information? I understand how the thing works. In order to track exposure, the app must track who has been in contact with the exposed. And sure it isn't on some central server, until it is. How convenient.</p>

        <p>Even if you don't get tested, if this becomes mandatory then pretty much all bluetooth + GPS enabled devices will be surveilled, which will mean even if you don't get tested, if someone near you does and you are using a smart phone or other bluetooth/GPS device, then you could be pulled into quarantine because they would be quarantining healthy individuals who had contact with the infected person.  That person could be a random person you shared a train carriage with, for example.  </p>
<p>At the moment, this wouldn't be a worry since the app is 'kind of' voluntary - the API is baked into the OS, but you have to download the app for it to use the API, but I would not be surprised if down the line this is skipped and turned into an always enabled feature of the Apple / Android OS that you cannot turn off or opt out, with strict penalties for not observing quarantine notices.  The app does not at this time record GPS coordinates along with anonymous bluetooth token either but again it would be very easy for it to do this, which is why I specify it needs both GPS and bluetooth for it to work as a mandatory measure.  This is why I advise not taking your phone out with you and using an old dumb phone.  Of course, they could also implement something whereby if a police officer checks and you are not running the app while you are out, they can do some heinous shit to you, let's hope it doesn't get to that, but possibly you could carry some kind of bluetooth spoofing device that might be able to avoid that.</p>
<p>Now take this idea a step further and imagine that in this terrible, dystopian world you are someone the state has a problem with.  There is no problem with them, from their centralised database, repeatedly flagging you for quarantine to effectively fuck up your life and remove you from whatever 'trouble' you are causing, and you have absolutely no legal recourse or ability to even see if the order is legitimate, it's just gone through the system.  This already happens in China where if your pass code is 'red' it won't let you in to certain businesses or places in cities, and you can't do anything other than sit there and wait until it hopefully turns 'green'.  The system doesn't tell you why your code is red, it just is determined by the state / the underlying algorithm.  Of course it doesn't need to be said that their algorithm is far more than just medical, and will include things like if you have been in contact with people reading or saying the wrong things online, or having a beer with a known 'dissident'...</p>

<p>This is what I'm worried about. My husband and I don't use smartphones; I have a Kindle Fire tablet, and husband uses an old Pantech wih Android Froyo as a "tablet" of sorts, but the phones we actually take places are both Alcatel MyFlips. Mother-in-law has a Samsung Galaxy tablet and some LG smartphone with Bluetooth, GPS, data, wi-fi, motion sensing, etc all turned on, but she "swears" she won't get tested or go to the hospital if she thinks she has COVID. First of all, I think she's lying, only saying that to keep peace with me and my husband. More importantly, her friends would get tested. Her brother and sisters would get tested. And even without contact tracing apps, they would gladly rat out everyone they've been in contact with. Probably even a few people they haven't actually been in contact with.</p>

<p>Not all states are participating, those of you in states that are listed as no response, pressure your governor and reps...not to get all biased but I think you will have more luck in red states if I was betting...</p>

        <p>I guess my biggest thing on this is that anyone who has more than a remote chance of dying from this is far too old to even own a cell phone, so why are they pushing it out to all 20-40 year olds? Surely can’t be what’s necessary to “keep us safe”. Seems wrong. Just give me the opt out option.</p>
