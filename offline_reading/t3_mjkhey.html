    <strong>Any Christians in the house? My take on the Vaccine Passport debacle</strong>
    <p><p>As we look to the near future, the idea of vaccine passports and vaccine verification (required by corporations in order to use their services) does not seem out of the ordinary.
We've already seen Ticketmaster, airlines and foreign bodies openly admit to such practices. </p>
<p><strong>This is all social programming and has nothing to do with the vaccine itself.</strong></p>
<p>The "show us vaccination records or don't use our service" <strong>will</strong> essentially evolve into "show us the chip or starve." </p>
<p>Let's take a look at the patent of ID2020 and it's <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020060606&amp;tab=PCTBIBLIO">available to the public abstract</a></p>
<p>&rt; Human body activity associated with a task provided to a user may be used in a mining process of a cryptocurrency system. A server may provide a task to a device of a user which is <strong>communicatively coupled to the server</strong></p>
<p>&rt; [...] The cryptocurrency system communicatively coupled to the device of the user may verify if the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, <strong>and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified.</strong></p>
<p>Remember all of the ridiculous 5G conspiracies being pushed last year? They were all distractions to keep these two projects from ever being tied together. 5G provides the infrastructure necessary to connect humans to these servers.</p>
<p>Now what about the cryptocurrency mentioned in this abstract? Funnily enough, the Federal Reserve announced in 2020 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2020/08/13/federal-reserve-reveals-research-plans-for-digital-dollar/?sh=2b39bc255946">they were rolling out their own digital dollar.</a></p>
<p>This is a reality folks. We are a few years away from true enslavement of the human race. We have nothing to fear though, as this was all prophesied in <strong>A.D. 96</strong> in the Book of Revelation.</p>
<p>Revelation 13:16-18: </p>
<p>&rt; Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead,</p>
<p>&rt; so that <strong>no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark</strong>, that is, the name of the beast <strong>or the number of its name.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.</p>
<p>(The patent number of ID2020 is factually WO/2020/060606).</p>
<p>If a Book written in the year 96 can accurately predict events occurring 1,925 years later, I'll take my chances in believing in God and everything else He had to say.</p>
<p>In the end, the best thing we can all do is prepare our souls above all else. Our short time alive pales in comparison to the eternity that awaits us after death, making our hardships on Earth even less significant than they truly are. And for people who don't know where to start, it's simple: God is always listening and loves all of His creations equally. Close your eyes, ask He forgive you for the sins we all undoubtedly commit, and ask Him to reveal Himself to you. He'll do the rest. </p>
<p>Peace</p></p>

        <p>Deliberate disinformation campaigns. So when the real thing comes along people like yourself refuse to believe the connection. Kind of like the 5G disinformation campaign this past year.</p>
<p>ID2020 will literally be tied to currency and is literally patented under 666. That's 2 for 2 thus far. Wheather it goes in the hand or forehead will be the red herring.</p>

        <p>It’s 060606 not 666 and the number is actually “six-hundred and sixty-six” not three individual sixes. So you’re still wrong.
Again, I don’t support the vaccine passport but there’s no mark of the beast either.</p>

        <p>If   you don’t take the vaccine you will be killed, and if you take it   you’ll regret it forever. This is the most valuable piece of information   on the entire earth at this time. You need to share this message with   everyone. The Harvest is plenty but the workers are few Luke 10:2. THE   FINAL WAR HAS BEGUN.</p>
<p>THE COVID-19   VACCINE IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST spoken of in The Bible! technology  666.  Covid-19 is a global plan. Part of that plan is the collapse of  the  global economy. The Beast spoken about in the Bible is a system, a   satanic organization. These people are called “33rd degree freemasons”   and they control the entire world, all of the religions, the media,   news, music, movies, and the mainstream narrative. Freemasonry is an   ancient cult of rich white people. The god of freemasonry is literally   Satan from the Bible. The richest people in the world literally worship   Satan. They want to create a new world order, a world society, each   person marked and controllable. </p>
<p>The   vaccine contains a gene editing technology called Cryspr, to change   your DNA. You will never be the same after taking it. It also contains   nanotechnology to connect humans to the Internet and control them. This   is called "Neural Link" mind control, using A.I. (artificial   intelligence) supercomputer technology. It will give them ultimate power   over people. To kill them or to control them. This is why they are   installing 5G towers around the world at a rapid rate. 5G speed is   needed to successfully control millions of people. They will turn them   on when more people are vaccinated. BIBLICAL PROPHECY. </p>
<p>The   vaccine also contains a chemical called luciferase which is taken from   fireflies to make you scannable, so they can see who has taken the  mark  of the beast vaccine. They are creating the race of Lucifer. It  even has  Lucifer's name in it! Anyone who takes this vaccine will go to  hell on  judgment day according to the Bible. They even called this  thing  Microsoft Patent # 666!</p>
<p>-&rt; <strong>Revelation 13:16-18.</strong>   (16) And they cause that all, young and old, rich and poor, free and   prisoner, receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead (17)   And that no person could buy or sell, unless he received the mark, or   the name of the beast, or the number of his name [all of these mean   taking the vaccine!]. And that eventually all should be killed who   refuse. (18) Here iswisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the   number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and it’s number is   Six hundred sixty six.</p>
<p>- The book   of Revelation was created from a dream that John received from 𐤄𐤉𐤄𐤀   (Ahayah = I AM) The Most High God. The details of visions and dreams   have metaphorical interpretations. </p>
<p>* Forehead = thoughts. </p>
<p>* Name = authority / purpose. </p>
<p>* The number of a man = mankind's patent system. </p>
<p>* It’s number is 666 = Microsoft Patent # 666. </p>
<p>The   greek word for what was translated as “mark” is khar'-ag-mah, and it   means a scratch or etching, something that pierces the skin! A VACCINE.   The mark is literal. The location of the mark is not literal. Right  hand  = being able to work and earn and spend money. </p>
<p>The   vaccine will soon be mandatory. You will have to take the vaccine in   order to join the new system they are creating. That is why Microsoft   and other software companies are involved in this vaccine. It’s not a   vaccine. Bill Gates is not a doctor and Microsoft is not a medicine   company, it’s a software company! This vaccine contains software to   introduce a Global “Biometrics-enabled Digital Cryptocurrency System”.   This is a new system of money that will soon be released after they get   rid of cash money. They will blame money for spreading Covid-19. WATCH!</p>
<p>-&rt; <strong>Revelation 14:9-11.</strong>   (9) If anyone worships the beast (freemasons/illuminati) and his  image,  and receives his mark in his hand or in his forehead,(10) he  will drink  of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without  admixture  into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented  with fire and  brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the  presence of  Christ: (11) And the smoke of their torment ascends forever  and ever;  and they have no rest day or night, those who worship the  beast and his  image, and who receive the mark of it’s name.</p>
<p>-&rt; Worship = submit to [receive the technology in their vaccine]. </p>
<p>* Image = Supercomputer Artificial Intelligence system. </p>
<p>*   Name = authority / purpose. Satan's purpose is to get people to be  sent  to hell on the day of judgment. Instead of influencing you to live  a  life of sin, they now have a new way to get people to be damned to  hell  forever by God. All they have to do now is get you to take the  mark.  They want everyone to take the vaccine. </p>
<p>Google   study / research these keywords: Neural Link, Luciferase,   Thermagrippers, Cryspr, Hydrogel, Quantum Dots, Artificial Intelligence   5G exposed, Microsoft patent # 666, Freemasonry exposed, Illuminati   exposed, AGENDA 21 EXPOSED, Georgia Guidestones New World Order, etc. </p>
<p>Conclusion:   they want to connect us to the A.I. supercomputer so they can control   us, and they want to change our DNA! This is why people do not repent   during the plagues that God will send on the earth soon. It tells you   that in Revelation 9:20. (20) And the rest of mankind who were not   killed by these plagues still did not repent of their sins. -&rt; They   are under mind control. Most people’s thoughts are already controlled by   demons, this technology will make it permanent. They will eventually   get the marked people to hunt down and kill the unmarked people when   they activate the Neural Link between the supercomputer and the marked   people through 5G.</p>
<p>Revelation   13:15 = They had power to give life to the image of the beast so that it   can use the marked people to kill everyone who doesn't submit and take   the mark of the beast = Connecting people to the system. Control of   thoughts. It’s also how they get all of these marked people to fight   Christ when he returns. Revelation 17:14, Joel 3, and Revelation   19:19-21 tells you about that.</p>
<p>Revelation   19:19 = And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their   armies, gathered together to make war against Christ. Revelation 19:20   tells you that people will be deceived into taking the mark of the   beast. Revelation 19:20: And the beast[the secret societies that control   the world] was taken away, and with him the false prophet[the churches   that are telling people to take the vaccine] who deceived them that  had  received the mark of the beast, were thrown into the lake of fire,  hell.  -&rt; people took the vaccine because they did not know it was  the mark  of the beast.</p>
<p>Revelation  19:21. =  And the rest of humanity who did not keep God’s laws or had  the mark of  the beast were killed by Christ, and all the birds of the  air were  filled with their flesh.  Matthew 24:22  = And  except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be  saved. -&rt; If you look up the  hebrew  words which were translated, the word for flesh = human genetic  code.  saved = preserved! What Matthew 24:22 really says is "except  those days  should be shortened, all genetic codes will be tampered  with."</p>
<p>-&rt;  The children of the  fallen angels are the ones in power, and they want  to give us their  genetic code. Once you inject this stuff into you, you  will never be  the same again. Whoever takes the mark of the beast will  be sent to  hell on the day of judgement when God judges us. Here is what  the Bible  says about people who put their trust in the satanic  weaponized  vaccine that satan’s people have created instead of God.</p>
<p><strong>[Romans 6:16]</strong>   Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves as servants to obey,   his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin unto death, or of   obedience unto righteousness?</p>
<p><strong>[1 Corinthians 3:16]</strong> Know you not that you are the Temple of God, and that The Spirit of God dwelleth in you? </p>
<p><strong>[Mark 12:17]</strong> And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.</p>
<p><strong>[1 Corinthians 6:19-20]</strong>   Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who  is  in you, whom you have received from God? Therefore honor God with  your  bodies. </p>
<p><strong>[1 Timothy 6:20]</strong>   O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane   and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called. </p>
<p><strong>[1 Corinthians 3:17]</strong> If any man defiles the Temple of God, God will destroy him.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is <strong>not</strong> the mark. ID2020 on the other hand fits the bill to a tee and that is just around the corner. The vaccine is just being used as conditioning, so when the mark does truly come around, they will be accustomed to the idea of not being able to access basic amenities without the governments say so.</p>

        <p>I'm confused by your thesis. Is not all His creation, which would include COVID and any related consequences therein? A true man of religion is unconcerned with worldly affairs. He dedicates himself to the search of truth, enlightenment, unity with God - whatever you want to call it. Everything else is just window dressing for our mediocre minds.</p>

        <p>Honestly I'm shocked how many Christians seem to be against the new normal. When you think about it, the rejection of authority is Satanic, not Christian, and is the literal sin that got Satan booted. Compare this to knowledge about covid, the vaccine, etc</p>
<p>Genesis 3:4-5</p>
<p>&rt;And the serpent said to the woman, "You will surely not die. For God knows that on the day that you eat thereof, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like angels, knowing good and evil."</p>
<p>Genesis 3:14-15</p>
<p>&rt;And the Lord God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed be you more than all the cattle and more than all the beasts of the field; you shall walk on your belly, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. And I shall place hatred between you and between the woman, and between your seed and between her seed. He will crush your head, and you will bite his heel."</p>

        <p>I spent the entirety of 2020 warning believers that this debacle was unnatural and designed from the pits of hell. Most dismissed me as a selfish conspiracy theorist and many, to this day, have no issue with vax cards. We are hurtling towards the end of the human age with the revealing of the antichrist moments away. It's heart-breaking to see so many believers who are utterly blind to the state of affairs.</p>

        <p>This is exactly my point. Not blindly obeying authority is exactly why we were driven out. Satan stood up to tyranny and was cast out. The serpent stood up to tyranny and was cursed. Cain stood up to tyranny being both cast out <strong>and</strong> cursed. So all this "tyranny is of Satan" makes literally no sense. I would bet everything I own not even one person behind this nonsense has the slightest understanding or interest in the LHP.</p>

        <p>&rt; Satan stood up to tyranny</p>
<p>Our Creator is anything but a tyrant. He's fair and just, which is why He gave us all the free will to make our own decisions, Angels included. </p>
<p>Satan's own envy got him cast out of Heaven. </p>
<p>In regards to Satan's role in all this, while God created this Earth, it is undoubtedly Satan's temporary throne (until Jesus' return). The Elite that truly run this world are all Satan worshippers and live to serve him. But because it was already spoken, you'll find that everything will fall in place as it's written in Revelation.</p>
<p>In the end, every knee will bow and every tongue confess. From the George Soros' to every living Rothschild.</p>

        <p>Your obsession with the word tyranny is strange, but it's the paper-thin comparison to God you've been desperately trying to drill that I can't wrap my head around. </p>
<p>You are free to live your life as you see fit. You've been made aware of God's existence throughout your life. Youve been exposed to His Word. His Return marks the End of the Earth as you know it, so bowing to your Creator should be the least of your worries.</p>

        <p>There is zero correlation because politics in general are a farce.</p>
<p>The Left and Right were created for the sole purpose of creating division. They both serve the same exact people/entity and collaborate in the enslavement of mankind.</p>
<p>Politicians resisting vaccine passports are putting on a show. They all know the outcome. They sprinkle in opposing views for the sole purpose of appeasing a large sect, but in the end they'll get their way, **because it was written."</p>
<p>Politics equate to the WWE. You can't compare something fake to Truth.</p>

        <p>Putting quotes around words not spoken by other people is not a good habit and is a good example of desperation on the losing side of a debate.</p>
<p>And I'm sorry you misunderstood. No, when Jesus returns you won't have to bow "or else", you'll just be physically unable to <em>not</em> bow in the presence of your creator. Regardless of race, religion, or creed. </p>
<p>And even still you will have the opportunity to accept or reject Christ because again, we all have free will. If youd prefer to take your chances with an eternity in Hell, so be it. But guess what, if I'm wrong about every word spoken in this thread, the worst that'll happen to me is an endless dirt nap. If you're wrong however, an eternity is a very long time and Hell seems like the last place I'd like to spend it. </p>
<p>I'll take my chances and I suggest you do the same. As another user pointed out, it's evident you haven't read the Bible beyond the nitpicks of the Old Testament often posted by r/atheism. Being the time period we're currently living in, I suggest starting with the New Testament and making your way to Revelation, where things will begin to become very clear to you.</p>

        <p>Either your reading comprehension was always lacking or your emotions are causing them to be non-existent. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say it's the latter. Where did I claim the only alternative to Christianity was Atheism? I'll wait on that...</p>
<p>In the meantime, yes, the sole creator of every living thing on this Earth expects some sort of praise and acknowledgement. It's a relatively small ask considering you wouldn't have existed without Him.</p>
<p>It seems like you simply struggle with pride and <strong>any</strong> authoritative figure causes emotional distress. </p>
<p>James 4:10</p>
<p>&rt; Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.</p>
<p>We can all use His help, and the small asking price in order to receive it pales in comparison to the spiritual riches you receive in return. </p>
<p>I hate to break it to you, but just because you were born does not automatically entitle you to anything. You have every opportunity to crack the stone surrounding your heart and it takes close to no effort (besides overcoming the psyche's natural stubbornness)</p>

        <p>Because 'Christianity' has been perverted, just as everything else had when sin first entered the world. As I mentioned already, Satan has his hand in everything on Earth, Christianity included. He knows his time is limited (again, because it was written) and his main goal is to divert as many souls away from God as possible before his reign outside of Hell is permanently squashed.</p>
<p>His greatest diversion from Christ is  the religion of Christianity itself. He's morphed it into a political party and war machine through mainly wolves in sheep's clothing.</p>
<p>Our time on Earth is temporary compared to an eternity in the afterlife. I like to think of it as a test that we all have the cheat sheet to (via the Bible). Those who willingly fail the test despite the answers being available to them will ultimately pay the price.</p>
<p>You don't need religion to turn to God. It's a matter of shutting your eyes and speaking to Him. It's deeply personal as I myself seldom attend church nowadays (even pre-Covid).</p>

        <p>Okay... yet this is all a ploy, because God is omnipotent (he claims) and so could literally fix everything. Instead he lets suffering drive worshipers to him. Look at what you've just typed:</p>

<p>This very ideology is identical to "you could have just kissed up to the government and gotten your covid vaccine, but you wouldn't so to the gulag!" This is tyranny.</p>

        <p>We are definitely not on the same page because I don't view the path of righteousness as being tyrannical. You're absolutely free to be sympathetic towards the devil and think of God's ways as tyranny, but make sure that you understand that we are NOT in agreement.</p>

        <p>Okay, but I'm saying to actually look at it. Which is more tyrannical- bestowing knowledge or punishing people for seeking it? Which is more tyrannical- requiring blood sacrifice or accepting the fruits of the earth? Which is more tyrannical- wanting absolutely  authorian powers over people or wanting shared power?</p>

        <p>Perhaps you should read the Bible at least once in your life: you'll see that God has not only given us all power, authority, knowledge, dominion, etc in Him through His Son Jesus Christ, He has adopted us as His children and made us co-heirs with Jesus. God the Father doesn't hoard - He shares everything with His children (ie, those who have been born again according to Romans 10:8-13).</p>
<p>You offer a typical luciferian false dichotomy because you assume incorrectly (because you have never actually read the Bible for yourself) that God the Father is secretly hoarding knowledge/power/etc for Himself. This is patently false and even the most superficial reading of the Bible would reveal this. </p>
<p>Again, if you want to be a luciferian or Promethean, feel free to go ahead - just don't say things for which you are not knowledgeable because you have never read the Bible. I was once in your shoes until I read a Bible for myself - suffice it to say, I no longer think that lucifer is the good guy.</p>

        <p>My friend, the proof of all this is literally in Genesis, God's own book. Are the governments the ones offering knowledge and freedom, or the ones cursing those who do and stepping upon them with their heal? Assuming i haven't read the Bible is literally identical to maskers saying "but you haven't read my one source that supports me!"</p>

        <p>You haven't read the Bible, and I am doubling down on that. You may have read random chapters and verses, but you have not read the Bible, particularly the NT. No-one who has read the Bible, particularly the words of Jesus, would continue to think that God is an authoritarian, power hungry, selfish maniac who suppresses knowledge. If you can prove anything beyond your conjecture, we can continue to discuss. Until then, you have some homework to do.</p>

        <p>You're being intellectually disingenouous and obtuse. If you want to argue that spiritual death is an acceptable consequence for sin, then go ahead. My point is that you have never read the Bible outisde of a few verses and chapters. I'll make it easier for you: once you have read the New Testament then circle back to me. I assure you that you will no longer be a luciferian/Promethean. When you can quote the word of Jesus saying that God the Father wants to hoard everything for Himself, send me an IM so that we can rehash this convo. Until then, toodle pip.</p>

        <p>I've read the Bible many times, both OT and NT though more the old. Planned to be a religious leader at one point. So what specifically are you wanting me to look for in the NT here? Surely you understand people can read the same thing and interpret it very differently. </p>

        <p>&rt;What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means! For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills. (Rom. 9:14-18)</p>
<p>&rt;And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. (Rom. 1:28-30)</p>
<p>&rt;The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed. (2 Pet. 3:9-10)</p>
<p>&rt;In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. (1 Pet. 1:6-7)</p>
<p>&rt;Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. (1 Pet. 4:12-13)</p>
<p>&rt;and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world.(John 4:3)</p>
<p>&rt;1Pe 2:17 Honor all men; love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.</p>
<p>&rt;Lu 12:5 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.</p>
<p>Damn this is easy, more? Also why do you ignore the OT? Are you a Gnostic? Is God so imperfect he changes? Is he just a liar?</p>
