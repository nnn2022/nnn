    <strong>The "dullness" of the jabbed</strong>
    <p><p>I've been having a bit of a discussion with someone on another sub about something that we've both noticed and found quite odd. I was wondering if anyone else has detected something similar. It seems that soon (\~2 weeks) after being "jabbed" people seem to lose their spark and seem to be dullified. A friend told me of a a clerk at their bank who was (naturally) very chatty, almost too, chatty before their "jab". However after their "jab" they hardly spoke at all. This clerk was even observed to accidentally walk into a wall. The other staff at that bank (which pushes "jabs") also seem to be without any spark. I personally know of several "jabbed" that seem duller now. I have found a video that seems to say that micro thrombi can be causing brain damage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sIWb9GTbbE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sIWb9GTbbE</a> I was wondering if anyone else noticed similar things, and does it vary depending on which (highly experimental) concoction one has been injected with. I'm also interested in the time-to-onset of the dullness symptoms. I'm wondering if this is now permanent or if it might get better. Could there be any way of empirically testing for this condition and establishing the extent and severity of the symptoms.</p></p>

        <p>Although I'm sure that there could be neurological side effects of the jab, is it possible that the doom and gloom has also potentially gotten to people?</p>

        <p>Yea it is tiresome. Even though I don't have to wear a mask anymore. So many at my work still wear them and still have random encounters where people will bring up the vax and delta variant and fear mongering bullshit... these people will need God himself to come down and tell them it is ok not to be afraid... and then they will need Dr. Fauci and every news anchor to say it... I am naturally very happy and "chatty" with a sense of humor but I find it is hard to shine a light in such overwhelming darkness. The people are suffering and it is all psychological and spiritual. The virus is not the threat. It is the systematic bombardment from every angle from the "authorities" and news media that seem to never want to let this hysteria go. This war sucks. I'd prefer bombs.</p>

        <p>Noticed this in an influencer/someone interesting on Instagram.   She even had a few posts about “losing her spark” which she attributed to needing to exercise more. Basically it’s like the light is out of her eyes.</p>

        <p>Wow, imagine if you are an airline pilot and your reaction time was reduced. They are requiring pilots to be jabbed. Frightening stuff. The FAA will eventually get some sort of stats because pilots do regular testing. Maybe they will cover it up though.</p>
