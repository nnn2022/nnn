    <strong>Coronavirus lockdowns are destroying my life</strong>
    <p><p>Prior to the California Coronavirus lockdowns, I was a student at UCLA and was having one of the best years of my life at school in the 2019-2020 school year.  I was just enjoying the freedom of being away from home, in a major city, hanging out with a large group of friends, and staying up late with friends or watching YouTube.  Then lockdown started.</p>
<p>I’m a strong libertarian, so I opposed the lockdowns the day they were announced.  I immediately viewed them as government overreach, disagreeing with virtually everybody I knew at the time.  My mental state slowly began to degrade.  The isolation increased my loneliness tremendously and brought me to using very unhealthy coping mechanisms which only made my loneliness far worse.  In addition, I have severe Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and I was feeling indescribably anxious every single day.  The combination of these problems was simply too much for me to handle.</p>
<p>I have thought about committing suicide virtually every single day since one month into the lockdown.  One time, the horrible problems and emotions I had been dealing with simply caught up to me, and I was very, very close to attempting suicide.  Honestly, I have no idea how I miraculously got a little bit better from those days which were only a few months ago.  I have not been seriously suicidal in the past month or so, to everybody concerned, though I am still dealing with the same problems that led me to consider suicide and I am not loving my life at all right now.</p>
<p>I still feel incredibly angry that the state is controlling my life, and worse yet that nearly everybody I know blindly supports the actions of the governor here.  My father is the worst offender.  He is a doctor, and He wants the lockdowns to remain as long as possible.  He legitimately believes every single thing Newsom and CA government is necessary to stop the disease.  He claims that Covid death numbers are under-counted (yes, you read that correctly).  He praises Gavin Newsom and Andrew Cuomo for their “amazing” Covid policies, and hates Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott with a passion, claiming that they will kill everybody, despite the fact that there is literally no evidence that lockdowns help stop the spread of the disease entirely.  Any time he sees a business with indoor dining or something that is crowded, he immediately goes on a moralistic high ground claiming that those people are horrible, disgusting individuals for simply living their lives.  He argues that even after a vaccine gets made we need to remain on lockdown to save more lives.  It is so infuriating to listen to, and even more infuriating to know that nearly all of my friends and family also agree with this mindset, when I know that so many people have dealt with similar problems as me.</p>
<p>I just want this insanity to end.  For life to go back to normal.  Why couldn’t our government take the approach Sweden did?  Why can’t I have my life back?  I just want to finish going to my University normally, the Swedish government at least did not infringe upon people’s civil liberties like California has.  I am so, so, so infuriated at the state.  I thought I was pretty libertarian before, but the insanity of lockdowns here have made me borderline anarcho-capitalist.  I just want to live my life.  I want to be free to do what I want.  I don’t want the government to control every aspect of my life for the next few years.  I want my life back.  If only I was born a few years earlier, or born and lived in Sweden, or even lived in virtually any other state, I would have most of my life back right now.  I am so angry.  People acknowledge that mental health has gotten much worse during the lockdown, but let’s be honest, we all know the bureaucrats don’t give two shits about mental health.  They want to keep power and I know that everybody I know simply views mental health and domestic abuse going up as a sad byproduct of the lockdowns.  My respect for AG Barr has gone up tremendously as he called Covid lockdowns a horrible violation of civil liberties.</p>
<p>For those living in California, how long do you legitimately think this will last?  It is so infuriating that we are one of the last states that is STILL locked down.  States like South Dakota are virtually entirely restriction-free.  Some claim that the lockdown is a massive sham to try and make Trump look bad, and that lockdown support in government will massively go down after the election.  I really hope that is the case, because I’ve reached my limit of incompetent bureaucrats telling me what I can and can’t do with my life.  I know that historically, I am exceptionally privileged, as the quality of life in the modern age is objectively higher than any other time in human history thanks to a market economy.  I also have the privilege of not living in a country where the government entirely controls every single aspect of my life, like the Soviet Union.  However, I still am not doing well mentally and I wish so badly that I could just go back to life before the government controlled everything and everybody I knew blindly supported everything the government did.</p>
<p>Only one good thing came from this, and that is that my political viewpoints have gotten more libertarian.  I have gotten tremendously into libertarian philosophy, austrian economics, and other related topics tremendously as my disdain for the government led to me researching these topics.  I am now considering a career being an economist, something which I never would have considered before lockdowns.  If I end up becoming the next Murray Rothbard, then maybe, just maybe, these lockdowns were a good thing for me.</p>
<p>Any other college students in California here?  If so, what has life been like for you recently?</p></p>

        <p>I read your post on Gold and Black. I just wanted to say I believe in you dude.  I'm counting my days out of CA. Do you stay or transfer? I can't say either way that's where your heart decides.  I can tell you this, California is not going to get any easier.  Especially after the election. However are you up for the challenge?  Transfer and work your ass off doing part time gigs, working wherever you can.  Its it going to be hard?  Abso-fucking-lutely. Will you prosper in the end?  If you keep at it. Whether you stay or transfer you got this.  I believe in you</p>

        <p>I'm not in California, but if I was I would probably focus on getting out as quickly as possible. But I know it's difficult to leave in the midst of school; I just made the decision to quit graduate school because my college became too restrictive.</p>
<p>I would suggest thinking about what you want the most, what options you have for getting it, and what you are willing to do to get it.  Whatever you decide, I hope you have better days ahead soon!</p>
