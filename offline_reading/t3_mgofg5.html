    <strong>This is going to be a heavy post</strong>
    <p><p>First off I want to say thank you just thank you so so much for letting me express myself here. I've been able to vent and just post whenever I want to get things off my chest. Or I just want to get rid of anger or stop feeling depressed by posting. It's just been so great being able to express myself without being judged, If I were to say what I say on here in front of my folks I think they would send me to a clinic. Sadly though this situation that is still going on in the world continues to have it's grip on me everyday. Before we dive in I just want to warn you all that this post may get heavy and if you get triggered from mental health issues then please turn back otherwise feel free to stay.   </p>
<p>I...have been waking up wanting to die...  </p>
<p>no matter what I do to try to escape it I always hear about covid. Whether it's from the news, someone at my work place, driving past board to work that mentions covid. Having to fill out this stupid covid form everyday. I have gotten to the point where I just want to die and be free from all of this. I know I have things good and some consider I have a much better living situation than others. However, I can't help it that this pandemic is just too much. The masking, isolating, finding a different job, finding a different place to live, etc. All of this without being able to take a break and travel somewhere because of my area's travel order. Sad thing is I can't even feel like I can trust therapists with this. They'll just think I am crazy because I can't accept how things are now. What hurts the most is knowing   I have spent the last year just surviving.   </p>
<p>I hate waking up to this pandemic everyday. It's torture on me mentally no matter what I do to try to distract myself or stop thinking about it. Which sucks the most because again I feel like I should not be feeling this way. Other people will look at me and say "how dare you feel this way when people have had it worse than you". I'm trying to hang in there because I do believe one day we can get past this. It's just been so hard....</p></p>

        <p>First, turn off the television. Second, unplug it. Third, get rid of it. Seriously! That will solve 50% of the problem. Then, go outside and realize you've been gifted this life. Breath the fresh air and feel the sun beat down on your biological vessel. Be here, now.</p>

        <p>Hey my friend - I can relate. But stay with us! The resistance needs you!</p>
<p>As the other reply days, turn off the news/media, find some like-minded people you can get outside with in the fresh air, bend the rules üòá</p>
<p>Fresh air, sunlight, lack of bs propoganda - and the world is much easier to be with.</p>
<p>I often get overwhelmed if I think too much about where this is headed. I try and focus on now, keeping myself right - and when in a more resources state, having conversations with others, bringing another perspective, but not at the expense of burning myself out.</p>
<p>I'm sorry - it's super tough... One could even argue you are <em>meant</em> to feel this way. Don't let them win - we need you ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè</p>

        <p>We are all allowed to mourn. You are, too. Find people to be social with, it helps so much. We all feel this way, stepping away from TV and internet helps, too.  You'd be surprised how many people are done with this bullshit.</p>

        <p>Hang on mate, </p>
<p>Turn off the TV, use your phone only for calling texting, whatsapp only for important family matters, meditate and as others were saying  be here now in the present. Forget fb and other media sites. </p>
<p>Burnout is not hard to overcome if you unplug yourself from technology for a few weeks/ months ... relax and speak with family/friends</p>
