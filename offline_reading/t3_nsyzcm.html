    <strong>Is COVID designed to be like an IQ test that gets easier and easier?</strong>
    <p><p>I noticed how, the more we go through this "pandemic", it looks like they are making it easier and easier to find out COVID is a scam. For example, recently they released Fauci emails which have clear evidence that Fauci lied about a effective treatment, and Fauci asking how the COVID "bioweapon" was made. If they wanted to keep it secret that this is a scam, they wouldn't do this, right? But it just keeps getting more and more obvious, like it's designed to test how dumb we are, so they can do something much more sinister...</p></p>

        <p>Yes and it is completely baffling how some people with "intelligence" can't seem to allow themselves to even entertain the idea they've been (even just partially) lied to. </p>
<p>The mind truly boggles</p>

        <p>I wonder this all the time. Some of the smartest people I know are still wearing double masks. They seem serious about it too. After a lot of thought I realized that booksmarts and academic achievement have nothing to do with common sense and the ability to listen to your gut and connect the dots in a real-life situation. Having achieved Career Success or academic success just proves that you have the ability to stick with something and follow through, or that you are good at memorizing facts and regurgitating them on exams. You follow direction well and do what you need to do to get through a system and achieve your end goal. That is not the kind of intelligence that helps you navigate your way  through the world and gets you through daily life. People who embrace this are generally not independant thinkers. They relish being part of the group of so called "smart people".</p>

        <p>I have noticed this as well. I'm an engineer working with other engineers and some of them have no common sense or ability to form their own opinions. They take everything the media says at face value and do none of their own research. Some of them have been so scared by the media that they still refuse to go out to the bars even though they are vaccinated. I've also noticed these same people struggle to make decisions at work when faced with something where there isn't one right answer.</p>

        <p>Yes! They don't trust themselves unless someone or something is reinforcing it and agreeing. Group consensus is the side they choose to be on. Even if they  have questions it seems like they take a back seat to just going along with the group or society. If any person or group is smeared they rarely stop to dig a little deeper to see what the truth actually is.</p>

        <p>I have very similar feelings. You have both political parties in America controlled by billionaire globalists and Just because liberal media refuses to touch faucis emails and fox is exploiting them doesn’t mean literally anything. Some billionaire globalist party is still instructing Fox News anchors to talk about this stuff. Meaning they <em>want</em> us to know about this. If they truly wanted zero recollection of this virus being man made then one would assume they wouldn’t have much of an issue hiding it. What is the goal here? It’s hard to see it just yet. De population? Global authority? Both..?</p>

        <p>I'm thinking the man-made bio weapon narrative allows for limitless moving of the goal posts. It can "mutate" as often as they like into whatever they like and nothing will ever require any proof.</p>

        <p>It's definitely a test. They keep pushing and pushing and see how far we'll go before people break. Then when they reach the point where the majority will not tolerate it, they ease up and pretend they are doing us a favor. The reality is, even if covid is over because enough people have caught it, this is a blueprint for the future. I have little faith people will not fall for this again. Hopefully enough people have learned a lesson.</p>
<p>I know I have. I was never scared, but I was like it's just two weeks. We can do that. I realize that was a scam, as was everything that followed.</p>

        <p>The email regarding how the bioweapon was created, that I saw was sent TO Fauci, no FROM him... Itd be like someone sending Trump an email titled "Thanks from all of us in Moscow" and using that as a smoking gun for Russian collusion.</p>

        <p>It's definitely there as a strawman. Bioweapon is a possibility if it was deliberately created <em>and</em> deliberately released, but all we've ever claimed is that it was simply the result of deliberate GoF research at the Wuhan lab.</p>

        <p>By the way, it wasn't Fauci asking how the covid bioweapon was made. </p>
<p>It was <a href="https://twitter.com/veryvirology"><strong>Adam Gaertner</strong></a> who sent an email to Fauci giving his take on how covid-19 could be a bioweapon based on the chemical properties of it. </p>
<p>When someone asked him for his comments about his email that he sent to Fauci, all he could reply with was <a href="https://twitter.com/veryvirology/status/1401006931485990912"><strong>this</strong></a>. </p>
<p>It's not compelling enough even for me. I'd stick with:</p>
<ul>
<li>how Fauci knew masks were shit</li>
<li>how lockdowns weren't beneficial at all</li>
<li>and there were emails sent to him about how there were other preventative medical solutions should be pursued (possibly HCQ being referred to here).</li>

        <p>And that's what u/E2-Rafael, myself, and quite a few others are scratching our heads about. Something very very odd is happening. </p>
<p>My own take:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are dealing with an "Intelligence" far beyond our human comprehension, and everything is a game where we're the pieces, and are being moved in a direction that I don't like (transhumanist agenda?). </li>
</ul>
<p>Fauci could <strong>not</strong> have been that ignorant that one day his emails would be used for a FOIA request. But he seems the perfect "fall guy" or patsy to take the hit. And lately Gates seems to be out of the public eye. I expect him to disappear from the news from now on. </p>
<p>Whenever you got the lame-stream media (MSM) jumping on-board a certain topic, then you have to try to take a step back and be hesitant with what sort of b.s. is being shoved down your throats. While China's Wuhan institute is suspect in this covid fiasco (as well as China has many things they hate being discussed about openly), this sudden "hate-train" towards China seems all too orchestrated. </p>
<p>All I can say is:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) watch the skies (yes, I mean it)</li>
<li>2) keep an eye out for more cyber attacks</li>
<li>3) keep an eye out for food price increases and food shortages</li>
<li>4) expect more discriminatory actions are taken against those of us left who refuse these covid-vaxx shot</li>
</ul>
<p>And 5) whatever the MSM outlets have to say on a particular topic, then check-out these journalists to see what their take is (somewhere in between the truth lies hidden):</p>

        <p>Obviously all the Q stuff is really hard to pin down because once it's time to know, everyone will definitely know.</p>
<p>That said, the Q drops are primarily focused on the Trump administration being the conduit for a complete unmasking of these globalist idiots.  The fast vaccine development and the economic springboard back was the opposite of the 2024/2025 lockdown end that the globalist Covid-19 documents state.</p>
<p>If we were locked down 4 years with corresponding economic damage and a reasonable amount of time had gone by and "trials" were done giving "good" data (digging deep into these animal MRNA studies with supposedly positive results show they just don't include dead animals in the final results, and there are MANY- science right now is just trash), basically all people would be begging for the vaccines.</p>
<p>The timetable made it a farce.  And I have no idea why Trump keeps recommending people participate in experimental transhumanist trials for a disease that's less deadly than the flu, but the emergency use authorization allows us to say no.  And if it was actually fully approved, they could actually mandate it and make it a condition for things like food stamps, health benefits (the real reason for Obamacare?), or unemployment benefits for all the people the lockdowns put out of work.</p>

        <p>Well yes, part of the game was hiding in plain sight, telling you that they are The Devil, and you shouldn't trust them, to laying out their plans for anyone to see, for telling you what they have planned, it's all part of the fun to see what they can get away with.</p>
<p>So yes, it is an IQ test.</p>
<p>Reminds me of this player in Season One? Of big brother he kept telling the camera "I've told these people I'm the Devil, they shouldn't trust me, I'll vote them out, but they never listen.."</p>

        <p>&rt;it easier and easier to find out COVID is a scam</p>
<p>It got super easy when George Floyd died. The BLM protests and riots were to protest against unarmed people being killed by police, which is fewer than 100 people per year in the US across all ages and races. Medical doctors were willing to go on record to support these protests because their expert medical opinion was that fewer than 100 people per year would catch covid and die as a result of these extremely large gatherings. The doctors may have underestimated covid a little bit, but the general idea was largely correct - millions of people gathered together but it did not create millions of dead bodies littering the streets. </p>
<p>To me, George Floyd marked the end of covid panic. It was around that time that my investments changed from 100% cash to almost 100% stocks.</p>

        <p>I haven't shared these links in a couple of days and it's relevant to your comment, so...</p>
<p><strong>Compulsory moral bioenhancement should be covert - Parker Crutchfield</strong></p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30157295/</p>
<p><strong>National Security Study Memorandum NSSM 200</strong> (Henry Kissinger 1975, declassified in 1989) related to World Population Plan of Action (covert education of public on benefits of not having children, sterility injections, etc.)</p>
<p><a href="https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf">https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf</a></p>
<p>The first one is an eye opener because there you have it right on our own government website --- lobbying that would put something into the vaccines "for the good of all" without telling us. I mean --- it's right there.</p>
<p>The second one --- everyone knows Henry Kissinger right? Well that monster worked on a population reduction plan \~45 years ago and it worked. They pushed population growth back by 20 years.</p>
<p>It's a long document, but there is juicy horror in there indeed... And you learn things, like the real reason why women were pushed into the workplace, and every children's book is designed to turn a girl into a man, and everything else is designed to turn a man into a girl.</p>
<p>Suddenly the "crazy conspiracy theorists" that tried to warn us for decades don't sound so crazy when you hear about covert education plans to teach Americans on the benefits of not having children.</p>
<p>He talks about injections... And the situation being serious enough that we have to do things that would have been "morally questionable" in the past.</p>
<p>And of course, you have to love his comment about how "we must appreciate the role of abortion in reducing world population."</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's a good read. Declassified in 1989.</p>

        <p>In my experience, the more “educated” someone is, the harder they fell for all the theatrics. They’ve somehow been convinced that people who refuse to wear a mask or get the jab are uneducated idiots and they fell for it hook, like and sinker. </p>
<p>What all this does is confirm that education is not intelligence, especially these days, where you can get pretty much any degree if you have enough money.</p>

        <p>I like your line of thinking.</p>
<p>At this point -- I don't even know who the majority of my friends and family members <em>are</em> anymore. Their <em>personalities have changed</em> and they've become so bizarre that I feel like a child in an Invasion of the Body Snatchers movie.</p>
<p>I'm serious -- people who were lifelong critics of authority and skeptical of power have all switched into a literal braindead mob with trigger words that short circuit the "CONSPIRACY THEORIST!" response in their brains.</p>
<p>They will say they don't trust government, and they don't trust media -- and somehow they are <em>lock step</em> on this entire thing.</p>
<p>And the <em>hate, anger, vitriol, condescension, and all around nastiness</em> to anyone who is skeptical...</p>

        <p>Is that a psiop tactic? It's been a while since I've read the guideline books on it but I vaguely remember this is a control method. You gaslight people and slowly ramp up the ridiculousness of it to the point where the person stops believing anything they see or experience.</p>

        <p>It burdens me how people are treating Fauci email leaks. From what I caught, first it was emails that were SENT TO Fauci, then the other ones was just the common information we have about covid with a "We're not absolutely sure" most of the time...
