    <strong>Vaccine causing lymphoma?</strong>
    <p><p>I posted this on a comment for another post regarding myocarditis but I don‚Äôt want it to get buried in there as I‚Äôm genuinely curious if anyone else has heard of this. </p>
<p>I made this alternate account to post about some anecdotal side effects I‚Äôve noticed. For background, I am an RN and I work for an insurance company doing preauthorizations, including chemotherapy preauths.  Part of my job includes reviewing the medical records to mostly do a double check that the dose and regimens requested meet clinical guidelines for the type of cancer, etc. I have had an alarming amount of patients lately who are all fairly young 20s-40s who were described as perfectly healthy and then became symptomatic following their covid vaccine. The notes all read the same... patient was perfectly healthy, then began to feel unwell and figured it was side effects from the vaccine but after swollen lymph nodes and fatigue, etc persist for weeks on weeks they go to the doctor and are diagnosed with lymphoma and now are getting chemo.  Patients are diagnosed via biopsy showing lymphoma cells, obviously. There are articles on Google about the vaccine leading to false diagnosis of lymphoma because it causes lymphadenopathy, but once the lymphoma is biopsy proven I would say this is not a ‚Äúfalse positive‚Äù. </p>
<p>Now of course this could be a coincidence, but like I said, I‚Äôm starting to see this more and more. I have not gotten the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù and have no plans to. Something does not sit right about all the bribery and peer pressure behind this.</p>
<p>Has anyone come across anything like this? I‚Äôm not sure if the vaccine is causing some sort of over-proliferation that‚Äôs leading to cancer development ? Again, this is all anecdotal information from my observations.</p></p>

<p>I've heard Dr. Robert Malone discuss this with Bret Weinstien on the darkhorse podcast. They mentioned this in passing but said if the lipid nano particle (LNP) and/or the spike protien can be found in the bone marrow, it can lead to lymphoma.</p>
<p>However, the evidence I've seen is scarce. 1 poorly done rat study, 1 small human study with 13 people. But both showed the LNP can go anywhere, then, in theory, so does the mnra that creates the spike protein. It's on people's radars now and hopefully more labs will look into it. But, if possible, I feel like waiting is a good idea until more evidence comes out.</p>

<p>Byram Bridle touched on this in the CPAC press conference.</p>
<p>He says the LNP is engineered to spread,  and evade antibodies. This is because the capsules were designed for drugs that needed to pass the blood-brain barrier, eg for unreachable tumors or alzheimer's or what-have-you.</p>
<p>It almost sounds like the drug companies dusted off their old design, stuck some mRNA in it, and called it a day.</p>

        <p>Also seems to be true. It's abysmal to see how Dr. Bridle has been treated when just trying to explain the data as he sees it. Exactly what researchers are supposed to do. Argue and test multiple sides until the truth reveals itself. </p>
<p>Literally just heard in the latest JRE podcast with Bret Weinstien and Dr. Pierre Cory from the flccc, explain that the vaccine engineered the s protien it creates to be different then the "wild" type to be identified by the immune system. Not to be non cytotoxic. This is because we did not know the wild type was cytotoxic until Uri manor from the Salk Institute showed that. There's no evidence yet to show the s protien from the vaccine is cytotoxic. But I think it should be known that it was unknown the wild type s protien was cytotoxic and the engineered vaccine s protien was to aid the immune system to identify it.</p>

        <p>My mother (who is a batshit crazy liberal type and we haven't spoken in years but whatever) was just diagnosed last week with stage 4 B cell lymphoma.  She is around 68 and Im certain she took that vaccine when it was 1st offered which would have been early on given her age.  Pure speculation but definitely worth noting in this discussion.</p>

        <p>I keep talking about the dangers of "leaky" vaccines. I really think the plan is to create a system where you have to take the shot, or risk death.</p>
<p>Dont do what we tell you to do? Then you dont get the shot.</p>
<p>It's a win/win for our leaders.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marek%27s_disease">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marek%27s_disease</a></p>
<p>&rt;Immunosuppression ‚Äì Impairment of the T-lymphocytes prevents competent immunological response against pathogenic challenge and the affected birds become more susceptible to disease conditions such as coccidiosis and Escherichia coli infection .[6] Furthermore, without stimulation by cell-mediated immunity, the humoral immunity conferred by the B-cell lines from the Bursa of Fabricius also shuts down, thus resulting in birds that are totally immunocompromised.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The demonstration of peripheral nerve enlargement along with suggestive clinical signs in a bird that is around three to four months old (with or without visceral tumors) is highly suggestive of Marek's disease. Histological examination of nerves reveals infiltration of pleomorphic neoplastic and inflammatory lymphocytes. Peripheral neuropathy should also be considered as a principal rule-out in young chickens with paralysis and nerve enlargement without visceral tumors, especially in nerves with interneuronal edema and infiltration of plasma cells.[8]<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The presence of nodules on the internal organs may also suggest Marek's disease, but further testing is required for confirmation. This is done through histological demonstration of lymphomatous infiltration into the affected tissue. A range of leukocytes can be involved, including lymphocytic cell lines such as large lymphocyte, lymphoblast, primitive reticular cells, and occasional plasma cells, as well as macrophage and plasma cells. The T cells are involved in the malignancy, showing neoplastic changes with evidence of mitosis. The lymphomatous infiltrates need to be differentiated from other conditions that affect poultry including lymphoid leukosis and reticuloendotheliosis, as well as an inflammatory event associated with hyperplastic changes of the affected tissue.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Key clinical signs as well as gross and microscopic features that are most useful for differentiating Marek's disease from lymphoid leukosis and reticuloendotheliosis include (1) Age: MD can affect birds at any age, including &lt;16 weeks of age; (2) Clinical signs: Frequent wing and leg paralysis; (3) Incidence: &rt;5% in unvaccinated flocks; (4) Potential nerve enlargement; (5) Interfollicular tumors in the bursa of Fabricius; (6) CNS involvement; (7) Lymphoid proliferation in skin and feather follicles; (8) Pleomorphic lymphoid cells in nerves and tumors; and (9) T-cell lymphomas.[9]<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In addition to gross pathology and histology, other advanced procedures used for a definitive diagnosis of Marek's disease include immunohistochemistry to identify cell type and virus-specific antigens, standard and quantitative PCR for identification of the virus, virus isolation to confirm infections, and serology to confirm/exclude infections.</p>

        <p>This one is my biggest fear so far. It basically makes it impossible for any human to survive without this particular vaccine. Not to be confused with the vaccines we take as children, the ones that protect us from diseases with mortality between 5 and 30 %. Nope. This one would be permanent and it would mean 100% mortality for the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>And on top of that, with Marek's, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-vaccines-can-drive-pathogens-to-evolve-20180510/">the vaccinated birds shed far more of the most virulent strains, unlike the unvaccinated birds which shed less virulent strains</a>. Hey, it's not me who said it, it's the scientists.</p>
<p>Scary stuff. Seems plausible too.</p>

        <p>So it was probably your posting that got me onto this kick as well- but, one thing that's reassuring is that Marek's is a herpes type virus, poultry that's infected will shed it for life. I think that makes this scenario a lot less likely with covid- simply because people aren't probably going to be shedding covid for life if they somehow incubated a more deadly strain...Or at least that's what I hope.</p>

        <p>I would recommend you watch the full Darkhorse Podcast with Dr. Robert Malone (inventor of mRNA tech) people are mentioning in the comments here: https://odysee.com/@BretWeinstein:f/how-to-save-the-world,-in-three-easy:0</p>
<p>They talk about a bio-distribution graph obtained from info gathered from one very small Pfizer study that shows total lipid concentrations in various parts of the body, and 2 areas that are of concern are the ovaries and bone marrow. Scroll down to "Organ Bio-Distribution Study" graph in this article: https://trialsitenews.com/should-you-get-vaccinated/</p>
<p>And like someone said, this is just one very small study but it may be of interest to you and your question although it's too early to tell really - I'm in no way claiming it's gospel. Rather, a potential signal that needs attention.</p>

        <p>There is discussion that the nano particles accumulate in the ovaries, bone marrow and lymph nodes.  So this makes sense if you know that.  </p>

        <p>I didn't put the 2 &amp; 2 together till now. But my cousin has lymphoma &amp; that means she's medically unqualified for the vaccine now that I think about it. My mom &amp; I wont get vaxxed. Don't know what her reasoning is. But I dont trust the medical industry et al.</p>
<p>I went from working at arjo pre-pandemic delivering medical beds to accounts where I most def needed to wear the gear &amp; follow the rules to fedex mid-pandemic where I could say fuck the precautions &amp; go without wearing a mask for days. I miss the latter job more. I belonged there &amp; had more good days than bad.</p>

        <p>Perhaps it's because of their DNA being modified through <a href="https://www.jefferson.edu/about/news-and-events/2021/6/discovery-shows-human-cells-can-write-rna-sequences-to-dna.html">reverse transcriptase</a>? "The researchers therefore noticed that some of polymerase theta‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù qualities were ones it shared with another cellular machine, albeit one more common in viruses -- the reverse transcriptase. " The "one more common in viruses" absolutely leads me to believe that the jab can cause this to happen. The modifying of your DNA, in turn, can cause <a href="https://cancerbiology.wisc.edu/2018/08/02/how-mutations-in-cell-dna-can-lead-to-cancer">cancer</a> if the right cells are modified. The first article supports this theory as well, saying, "In unhealthy cells, such as cancer cells, polymerase theta is highly expressed and promotes cancer cell growth and drug resistance. It will be exciting to further understand how polymerase theta‚Äôs activity on RNA contributes to DNA repair and cancer-cell proliferation.‚Äù. So I'm thinking it's a bunch of people that already had cancer genes in them, they got the jab, and now the genes have gotten turned on and multiplied insanely quickly.</p>
