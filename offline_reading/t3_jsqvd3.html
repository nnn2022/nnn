    <strong>Alright so let me look at the facts</strong>
    <p><p>So, we have a virus on the loose which is very likely to not kill you, but it also may or may not give you any symptoms. If you have it (which most of the population dont know if they do) you may or may not transmit it to someone else. You can get tested to see if you have it, though the test may or may not give you a false positive. In the event that you possibly have it then you have to wear a mask which may or may not work in slowing the spread.</p>
<p>Also, we are going to be implementing lockdowns which will absolutely bring about depression and suicide. We are going to close down people's businesses which will certainly crash the economy and bring more depression, suicide and poverty. We're going to close down schools which will certainly negatively impact the lives of developing children. We're going to launch a fear propaganda campaign to get people even more afraid of this deadly disease so that they won't go to the hospital even when they really need it, thus certainly causing a lot of preventable deaths.
And on that note, we're going to stop with non-essential treatment for non-urgent patients (you know, like chemo for cancer patients, surgery, etc.) Which will certainly cause a few deaths. Oh and social gatherings, concerts and events are forbidden, which will certainly further ruin the lives of people who depend on these things for their livelihoods.</p>
<p>And don't forget that if you are against any of this then you are a selfish granny killer, conspiracy theorist, flat earther, covidiot, karen, moron, lunatic who is putting everyone's lives at risk!</p></p>
