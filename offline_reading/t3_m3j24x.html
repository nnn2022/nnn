    <strong>1523 Deaths Following Covid-19 Vaccines reported as of 3/5/2021</strong>
    <p><p>The new data was released on the CDC VAERS today.</p>
<p>1523 deaths have been reported as of 3/5/2021</p>
<p>Normally less than 1% of adverse vaccine reactions are reported, although the fact that most people hear about this vaccine 20 times a day likely means that more people are reporting this data than normal.</p>
<p>You can see all the detailed reports at the following link below.</p>
<p>How to see the data after clicking on the link</p>
<p>1.) Scroll down and click "Agree"</p>
<p>2.) Click the "Request Form" Tab at the top left</p>
<p>3.) Click Any of the "Send" Buttons that are on the right side of the screen, you might have to scroll to see them</p>
<p>4.) Click the "Results Tab" at the top</p>
<p>You can also choose to fine tune your search when you are on the "Request Form"</p>
<p>The link basically takes you to a saved search that I created, but as you can probably tell the CDC does not make it "easy" to access this data.

        <p>Please share with specifically what a coroner would look for to connect a death to a vaccine?</p>
<p>We know WHY these deaths are likely occuring 
Pathogenic priming or ADE 
Here is what an ADE death looks like in a 28 year old woman:
"Patient vaccinated on 12/28. Approximately one day later, develops cough and on azithromycin x 1 week. On 1/3, patient develops left-sided weakness and aphasia. Taken to the hospital, tested COVID+, required intubation -- acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID - on H&amp;P. Patient died on 1/4/21 at 7:20am."</p>
<p>From my research it is basically impossible to link a death from the causes directly to the vaccine with evidence.</p>
<p>The fact that MANY young people who have been vaccinated have died while testing positive for covid-19 is enough evidence for me.</p>
<p>According to the CDC the mortality rate for covid by age </p>
<p>0-19 years: 0.003%
20-49 years: 0.02%</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html</p>
<p>For comparison the swine flu vaccines were halted in  1976 after 36 deaths were reported.</p>
<p>Hmmm
 I wonder what changed, influenza is know to have a much higher infection mortality rate than covid-19 especially in young people.</p>

<p>What do you consider young people? From the VAERS wonder tracker, in 2021 there have been 184 deaths within a reasonable amount of time from getting the vaccine for people aged 18-64. There have been 30,356,467 vaccines administered to this age group. Meaning even if 100% of the deaths were a direct result of the vaccine, it would be a 0.000606% mortality rate. That's the absolute most conservative mortality rate. Even with this absurd conservatism, that is significantly below the covid mortality rate you have in your comment. </p>
<p>In actuality, many of the people that die already have serious underlying health issues. Which is how the CDC is able to determine that there is no evidence that the vaccine contributed to their deaths. </p>

        <p>You are assuming every death is reported.
In reality around 1% are actually reported.</p>
<p>MOST people in this age group have not been vaccinated twice.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from a study warning us about pathogenic priming and coronavirus vaccines.
"Researchers need to understand in particular whether the vaccine causes the same types of immune system malfunctions that have been observed in past vaccine development. Since the 1960s, tests of vaccine candidates for diseases such as dengue, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have shown a paradoxical phenomenon: </p>
<p>Some animals or people who received the vaccine and were later exposed to the virus developed more severe disease than those who had not been vaccinated"</p>
<p>Many of the deaths in young people have been due to liver failure or strokes, both of which are caused by pathogenic priming.</p>
<p>Similarly [3], found that ferrets previously vaccinated against SARS-CoV also developed a strong inflammatory response in liver tissue (hepatitis). Both studies suspected a “cellular immune response”.</p>
<p>[3] https://jvi.asm.org/content/78/22/12672</p>
<p>Most deaths caused by these vaccines would not be expected for months from now because the body needs to begin creating antibodies in response to the vaccine and THEN get infected with the live virus.</p>
<p>The few deaths we have seen so far are likely due to people who were already infected with the virus when vaccinated.</p>
<p>Considering the vaccine is suppose to help people not make future infections worse this is a problem that needs to be looked at before we continue to vaccinate millions of people.</p>
<p>I'm not saying there is for sure a problem, but it is indeed a possibility so why put so many people at unknown risk for a virus that does not even cause symptoms in most and kills less than 1% of those that do end up getting infected.</p>

        <p>“Adverse events from drugs and vaccines are common, but underreported. […] Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. Low reporting rates preclude or slow the identification of ‘problem’ drugs and vaccines that endanger public health. New surveillance methods for drug and vaccine adverse effects are needed.”</p>

        <p>This is 1% of adverse effects are reported. You said 1% of deaths. I can see how when you are researching, these things make sense to you. But you are missing small details that make a world of difference.</p>

        <p>?</p>
<p>So 150,000 possible deaths instead of 160,000</p>
<p>Either way it is very odd that the CDC continues to say "There have been no abnormal deaths"</p>
<p>The scary part is from what I understand about pathogenic priming we shouldn't even be seeing MOST deaths for months.</p>
<p>Vaccinating millions of people without knowing what will happen long term is insane.</p>
