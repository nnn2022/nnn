    <strong>Can it be concluded that the pandemic showed the true colors or “progressive” socialist countries?</strong>
    <p><p>Before covid, I used to highly respect countries like Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as most of Europe and progressive countries in South America. But the totalitarian way they have chosen to handle the new common cold (since covid is ENDEMIC, it will never go away) has shown me that honestly for best of worse, America might be truly the best nation in spite of its poor mental health situation (weekly massacres and extremely turbulent politics). To me, freedom cannot be negotiated. Being able to go out and enjoy nature, is something that cannot be bargained even with “life”.</p>
<p>What’s life worth in eternal restrictions and limitations? It has been almost 2 years, to be told “this is going to end soon” is an act of mockery, people really need to wake up and confront their governments. The health pretext is growing old. Lockdowns, curfews, movement limitations, and all sorts of freedom disruption cannot be tolerated.</p></p>

        <p>The last year and half has exposed just about everyone's for who they really are. That's the silver lining. I got to see how many people around me are full of shit. I found out that a lot of people I know would throw me and others under the bus at the drop of a hat. It became even more clear that my decision to home school my kids was one of the best I've ever made. Now I know that there is a very disturbing problem with local law enforement, one that is far worse than what the media and public servants tell us it is. I found out that I am surrounded by millions of control obsessed hypochondriacs. I could go on and on with this list of things that the last year has shown all of us. It's fucking ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Yeah get ready for annual experimental booster shots for a disease that has a 0.02% chance of killing you...possibly 0.002% if the asymptomatic bs is true so you can protect those at risk that already had their experimental vaccine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile tech overlords make billions. I seriously hope we move away from the current trends and start voting technocucks out.</p>

        <p>We had no lockdowns and no mandatory mask use in Sweden and vaccinations are voluntary.</p>
<p>We seem to have weathered covid significantly worse than our neighbors though.</p>
<p>Freedom is a double edged sword.</p>

        <p>Thats not true. </p>
<p>70% of Sweden's first wave of victim's had 5 - 9 months of life expectancy without covid, ie. they would all be dead with or without it.</p>
<p>As for Finland and Norway, the same folks that died in Sweden died in those countries during the same period.</p>

        <p>I have no major problems with masks and I am vaccinated. Mandatory mask use in vaccinated people is absurd, but people can still choose to mask up whenever they want. Lockdowns and other forms of movement restrictions are completely useless against covid and condone massive mental health and social problems (especially now that has been almost 2 years)</p>
