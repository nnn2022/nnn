    <strong>Never seen anything like this vaccine extremism</strong>
    <p><p>I don't ask anyone if they have taken the vaccine. I would never dream of prying into someone's medical history unannounced. If they haven't, great, it's somebody I know I can have a beer with. If they have, also great, it's also somebody I could have a beer with. Maybe there's just one topic we shouldn't talk about, no big deal.</p>
<p>But not them. I just joined a subreddit dedicated to a TV show. There was a person on the show who had been prescribed gabapentin for depression. Gabapentin is not an anti depressant and ironically causes suicidal thoughts - this is written in bold on the drug. So I said some doctors were dumb. Coming from me, having been disabled by a doctor's malpractice at 31, this is a very reasonable thing to say. </p>
<p>And then within an hour somebody had clicked on my name, went through my post history, and replied not about the TV show but with "anti vaxxer" accusations. These people have taken the fun out of life. We had a TV show we liked in common, but he just had to pry. When I clicked on his profile his avatar is a dude with a pink goatee, so I'm not entirely surprised.</p>
<p>My family is fighting daily amongst each other with the family medical professional pushing everyone else on how "safe and effective" it is and somebody else mulling over the decision every second of every day. This person keeps reminding me all the reasons they don't want to take it until I've finally said several times "then don't take it, but shut the hell up about it already"</p>
<p>What is this all about? Is it just really nosy people who want to impose compliance? Or is it all an attempt to humblebragging what a hero they are because by virtue of their insults, they're announcing they are vaccinated?</p></p>

        <p>Here’s part of the problem in a semi-funny way :)</p>
<p>How do you know someone is vaccinated?  </p>
<p>Don’t worry, you’ll constantly hear them talking to other vaccinated people about who had the least number of side effects. </p>
<p>This is seriously why many of them feel ok asking.  They want to see if you had worse side effects than them to feel better about their decision.</p>
