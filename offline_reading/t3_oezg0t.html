    <strong>The Media Is Trying Hard To Ignore Biden's "Summer Of Freedom" (Or The "End" Came And Went!)</strong>
    <p><p>But if you look hard enough, you can see the reporters truly loyal to the regime.</p>

&rt;‘A summer of freedom’: Vaccine gives new meaning to July 4th</p>
<p>&rt;“We welcome you to join us by hosting your own events to honor our freedom, salute those who have been serving on the frontlines, and celebrate our progress in fighting this pandemic,” the White House wrote in an email to state and local officials Tuesday. It asked them to share their own plans, which the administration would later highlight.</p>
<p>&rt;“America is headed into a summer dramatically different from last year,” the administration wrote to officials. “A summer of freedom. A summer of joy. A summer of reunions and celebrations.”</p>

&rt;Biden celebrates a July 4th 'emerging from the darkness'</p>
<p>&rt;"Thanks to our heroic vaccine effort, we've gained the upper hand against this virus. We can live our lives, our kids can go back to school, our economy is roaring back.</p>
<p>https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2021/07/05/weve-gained-an-upper-hand-against-covid-19-says-us-president-joe-biden.html
&rt;'We’ve gained an upper hand against COVID-19,' says US President Joe Biden</p>
<p>&rt;“Two hundred and forty-five years ago, we declared our independence from a distant king. Today, we are closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus.”</p>
<p>https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/04/opinions/july-fourth-biden-celebration-obeidallah/index.html
&rt;Why this July Fourth feels like a celebration</p>
<p>&rt;Many people played a role in getting our nation to this point. But it was having Biden in the White House and Trump out of it that played an oversized role in our nation's success. That's why this July 4th feels like more than just about a return to normalcy. It feels like a celebration.</p>

&rt;Biden Marks 'Independence' from Covid, But Pandemic Remains Yet to be 'Vanquished'</p>
<p>&rt;Despite the atmosphere of Sunday’s victory party, the Biden administration says it is concerned about the large numbers of people who have still not got vaccinated.</p>
<p>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-july-4-remarks-watch-live-stream-today-2021-07-04/
&rt;Biden urges Americans to "think about how far we've come" since last year</p>
<p>&rt;emerging from the "darkest of years, a year of pandemic and isolation, a year of pain, fear and heartbreaking loss." Mr. Biden said that COVID-19 "no longer controls our lives, it no longer paralyzes our nation and it's within our power to make sure it never does again." </p>
<p>And the cherry on top:</p>

<p>So now it's a battle between the carrot and the stick. The "Heroes" of vaccines and "Villain" dirty super spreaders. Joe Biden was desperate for the media to roll out the carrot... but so many in the media are still having fun trying to bash you with the stick, over and over... like those guys from Office Space on the Printer.</p>
<p>The "End" Came And Went! And the "science" never mattered. Not for one minute. The politics. It's been all about the politics the entire time.</p></p>
