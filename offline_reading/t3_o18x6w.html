    <strong>If this is actually as serious as the media are saying‚Ä¶</strong>
    <p><p>What do we do? Does everything that happened the past 15 months become justified. Do we all hunker down for a bit to eradicate?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm genuinely curious as I keep floating back and forth between taking it seriously, and questioning everything I see.</p></p>

        <p>Ask yourself how many people do you know that actually died from covid or had side effects from getting it, then consider how much you value being able to live your life without covid restrictions. Your conclusion should follow from there.</p>

They don‚Äôt care and don‚Äôt wear masks in the break room. They don‚Äôt care if you wear a mask in your room  when they go in.  Hmm.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of people would have been ok with "hunkering down for a bit" - two weeks to flatten the curve as they used to tell us - its now been almost a year and a half.  Here in Ontario we are in a WORST position than we were last summer with most stuff still locked down because of VaRiAnTs - this could literally go on forever if we let it.</p>
<p>Look at everything that has happened in the last year and a half and ask yourself if everything makes sense and I think you'll get the answer.</p>

        <p>in australia, states will shut down over one case. yes, that's one positive test. they can be asymptomatic, doesn't matter, lockdown and facemasks mandated along with heavy fines for not complying. the highest cases are in the state that has been in lockdown the longest; i can't remember how long they were in lockdown but it was months and at one stage I think it was the longest lockdown in the world. they are back in lockdown over 5 or 6 cases i believe.</p>
<p>australia is now on the cusp of economic ruin. much of it is due to the lockdowns but australia's economy was going down the toilet anyway, pre-2020. the pandemic has actually given us respite, allowing the govt to pause the economic disaster that is fast approaching.</p>
<p>my point is, there are much bigger problems coming than this pandemic. the economic armageddon that is fast approaching will make the past 18 months look like a walk in the park.</p>

        <p>I can safely say that there is a war on humanity. By who? It's complicated, and I don't want to delve too deeply into the rabbit hole, but just know that you would never have imagined this current situation back in the summer of 2019, right? I suspect things will get even more crazier and dire as the months go on. I see no end to this until people start realizing we're being culled.</p>

<p>I know many people who haven‚Äôt stopped hanging out seeing people since March 2020
Literally every weekend and are perfect fine. </p>
<p>few things I have learned over the last 15 months is:
1. how unhealthy ppl are especially Americans
2. How deep the swamp is 
3. How fake the MSM is with there daily dose of lies and propaganda</p>
<p>4.How easily people can be brainwashed.</p>

        <p>Covid is basically a slightly more deadly version of the flu which is why the majority of deaths are people that would die from the flu anyway. </p>
<p>My honest opinion is that they developed the covid virus/the covid vaccine and released it upon the world intentionally for two reasons -</p>
<p>1) To reduce the amount of elderly and seriously ill people in the world due to overpopulation and increase infertility to reduce births as they double deaths. </p>
<p>2) To scare as many people as possible into being obedient slaves and make them hand over their own personal freedom, liberty and sovereignty.</p>

        <p>Best thing to do imo, is to turn off the TV, stay away from reading the news, and move somewhere that's fully open. There are parts of the world stuck in a bubble of dogma that can't see the forest through the trees. Then there are areas of people living life where there's no worry of an elusive virus</p>

        <p>That's what I said to my father and my wife when they said I need to get the vaccine because people are dying from it.</p>
<p>I asked them "Do you know anyone that's died from covid at all" and they both answered "no". They can't even sense their own stupidity</p>

        <p>My folks are the same way, you can see the hamster wheel running in their head when you ask.  I know 2 people who had it, one prob medically obese and she said the worst part was losing taste and smell (it‚Äôs back now).  On the other hand I know someone who died within 48 hrs of moderna and another person who hasn‚Äôt had a period for 2 years and is now gushing like a stuck pig.</p>

        <p>If everyone hunkered down for a bit, followed protocol, and got vaccinated we will be done with this much quicker than we are now.
Most people are against these things because they are anti authoritarian and want to go against the government at every step. Doesn't matter if it is right or wrong, good or bad, better for the need of the masses or what of few (and I don't only mean big evil corporations). They just want to rebel for the sake of rebelling</p>

        <p>Get yourself healthy. We are all going to get Covid at some point, if we haven't already. Exercise, eat healthy, get your vitamin D levels up, if you're obese then work on losing. Instead of worrying about being a victim, stand up and fight.</p>
