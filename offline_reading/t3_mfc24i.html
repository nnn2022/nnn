    <p><p>Just absolutely brutal. Yeah the tiktok nurses were bad, but think of how many others went viral with their fake ass thousand yard stare selfies. Like, how many shots did it take you to get that fake shellshock look just right you absolute fraud?</p>
<p>It's come to the point where when someone on here or elsewhere claims to be some kind of a medical professional or married to one or whatever and they talk about how hard the last year has been and how much they've had to work etc, I just straight up don't believe them anymore.</p></p>

        <p>I was mis-prescribed benzodiazepines. Fun times. It took a pharmacist at a grocery store to figure out what my actual problem was.  I came in, desperate, because they stopped working after a few weeks, and I was desperate to find something that woukd help. Benzos weren't solving the problem, they covered it up until it got too bad.</p>
<p>Yeah, fuck doctors.</p>

        <p>Oh my god. This has happened to me. It was a psychiatrist though and it was a mood stabilizer. But it had just been FDA approved for teens so it was really expensive. She gave me free samples for a month. </p>
<p>I was on them for 6 months and I never took them because you’re supposed to eat them with food and they didn’t work. I was like 16 too .</p>

        <p>I was prescribed anti-psychotics that I didn’t need. Almost made me kill myself, like I had to be forcefully stopped because I was hallucinating so badly</p>
<p>I was also prescribed Ritalin when I was 12 because I said I couldn’t focus well in school (was just my anxiety/depression). I felt like I was on meth</p>

        <p>My best friend was hooked on these drugs, didnt have any left and killed himself last year. Jumped under a bus.
Not to mention his shrink KNEW he was suicidal and just wrote him off as a patient.</p>
<p>I never looked at doctors the same. I never liked them to begin with as i had to undergo a surgery as a kid that made me terrified of needles and smell of hospitals but this did it completely for me. Thankfully for me no serious need for doctors yet. I eat very selectively, i manage my weight and stress, dont drink, smoke nor do drugsand i declined the offer to be put on anti depressants which they pushed on me when i was justifiably upset over my friends death. Your misery and stress is their profit. Cut it at the core.</p>
<p>Also, no wonder you needed a stimulans to manage school. School is boring af. The fact they poison kids with this infuriates me.</p>

        <p>So sorry about your friend. That should’ve never happened. Don’t blame anyone but the doctors involved with that. It infuriates me how most doctors will just give out whatever drug to whomever, no matter their medical history or the risks they would have taking them. These aren’t things to be messed around with. These aren’t substances to be sampling left and right. These are mind altering substances. Certain drugs can be very powerful if put into the wrong hands</p>
<p>I hate hospitals too. My life is a constant in and out of surgery and I’ve always had an extreme fear of being put under. Not because I’m scared of the drugs themselves, but because I don’t fucking trust anyone. I’ve had my body taken advantage of too many times in my life, at a very early age. I can’t ever feel comfortable knowing I’m fully unconscious, allowing complete strangers to have full control over my body to whatever they please</p>
<p>Every surgery I’ve gone through I’d have a major panic attack before and after because I feel like someone will or has violated me in some way during the surgery</p>

        <p>Yeah I mean, his whole case was mismanaged from the get go. First he got physically injured, and they prescribed opioids. He got hooked on that. Opioid epidemic is yet another reason you should be wary of docs and their advice. </p>
<p>Then, because his life got fucked by the injury, they gave him a cocktail of mental health drugs. Anti this that god knows what over the years. He was hooked on that too. So badly he sometimes bought cheaper street alternatives for what he was getting. <br>
Then he proclaimed he's suicidal a few years back. You know what they did? Locked him up. Tied him up in an isolated room and left him there for few days. They also drugged him to sedate him. His gf at the time called help on him and he made everyone around him promise they wouldnt do it. How would this be helpful to an already depressed person? You call this a science? You call this helping people? Fuck me man....</p>
<p>Fuck thats terrifying. In and out of surgery. I only had one in my life, granted as a child and i too have panic attacks anytime someone wants to draw blood. I legit cant breathe nor look at whats going on. I dont mind blood, just needles and being "handled". Is this going to go on? I hope for your sake you get a break from this crap.</p>

        <p>My shrink in college tried to blame pot for my depression, kept telling me it couldn't possibly be the fact that my entire youth was spent being told boys are defective girls, watching my free speech die, my ex not wanting to go to the same college, or any other litany of real-world problems.</p>
<p>It took realizing that the only person who could change my locus of perception to understand that life sucks and it's my choice to move forward instead of dwelling to fix my problems. </p>
<p>But the medical industry doesn't want you to solve your own problems. That wouldn't be profitable enough.</p>

        <p>They fucked me up too as a kid. The needle tryout for blood samples galore for interns who just poke the shit out of your arm because theyre incompetent was just one of the many things. I do somewhat blame my folks, they shouldve know better than to give a 3 yearold to strangers and leave her there for weeks for a surgery that was anything but urgent.</p>

        <p>A diabetes "specialist" misdiagnosed me with type 1 diabetes when I was 12. The whole situation made me suicidal and angry at world. Before they changed me to fast acting insulin which can easily kill if not calculated properly, my mother pushed for genetic testing. Turns out I have MODY 2 which means my blood sugars are slightly raised but respond normally to my naturally produced insulin. Infact my type of diabetes gives me increased cognitive function while in a severe calorie deficit. Ever since then I've advocated for people to thoroughly research any diagnosis they're given to see if it's accurate to their symptoms.</p>

        <p>I'm a nurse (been on maternity since last april) and I am disgusted with the NHS. I don't want to be a nurse anymore because of how the NHS has let patients down. How the staff posting their weepy mask marked face (oh boohoo, I get marks like that from wearing anything even slightly tight) acting like they were fucking battle scars or something. How medical professionals are calling out for mandatory vaccination and medical segregation. Staff moaning about not being clapped for anymore and NHS discounts stopping...Did you really become a paramedic, nurse, dr, whatever for backpats???</p>
<p>People young and old dying alone makes me feel sick, if I was working (I'm a junior sister) I would have let relatives in, it's inhumane not to.</p>
<p>Cancelling life saving treatments when the NHS "because COVID" is snowed under every fucking year anyway. We NEVER have any beds in the winter...I've nursed patients in corridors for about the last 5 years in the winter. How are they prioritising the fucking flu over cancer operations. </p>
<p>Elderly being abused and left to rot in carehomes. Agency staff allowed to work in different homes each day but people can't see their family???</p>
<p>I worked during the pandemic whilst heavily pregnant - if I'd have thought this was as dangerous as they like to make out I wouldn't have done it. But I've always seen it as just another flu variant. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I want to leave but nursing is all I've known since I was 18 (30 now)  and it really was my passion but this last year has disgusted me to the core. I don't know what I'd do.</p>

        <p>I went to the dermatologist to get some lipoma cut out.  Not thinking about anything, and assuming that dermatologists were well suited for minor subcutaneous tissue removal with minimal scarring I went in for the procedure.</p>
<p>I received massive scars, the doctor's sutures were sloppy and the procedure lasted about 3x the amount of time as was expected.  My wife who is a provider was shocked how bad it was.</p>
<p>Years later, I'm talking to a MD casually about his medical school experience and 20+ years in the industry and I realized why.  Minority candidates in medical school are allowed to repeat an unprecedented amount of failed courses and to pass with grades considered unacceptable for whites.  The dermatologist was black.  Facts are facts.</p>
<p>Don't care how bad it sounds, if you have a black doctor, there is a way higher chance that they should not be placed in that position of responsibility.  I learned by large scars on my body that are permanent.  It doesn't matter if it isn't every single doctor.  If your health really matters, if your life is really on the line, you're not going to roll the dice in hopes that you're not perceived as racist.</p>
<p>You play the odds that are best in favor of your survival.</p>
