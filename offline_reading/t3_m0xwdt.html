    <strong>I met a normal person today</strong>
    <p><p>Today I had to take my 4yo to the toilet. While we were in there on the back of the door was some info on staying home to keep everyone safe. My daughter asked what it was about, I’m always pretty honest with her. I explained how the government is trying to keep us inside instead of out living our lives. I don’t sugar coat things with her but she doesn’t completely comprehend it either. Anyway, we were washing our hands and a lady came out of the stall next to us. She confidently said “It is all about control”. We proceeded to have a 5 minute conversation about the lockdowns and vaccines. She was so passionate like myself about fighting back in every way we can. I was so overjoyed I actually met a normal human today! Gives me faith in humanity.</p></p>

        <p>I would tell my kids (which I wouldn’t have any because I am antinatalist) that this is just a game of pretend but only some of the adults know it is. I also make my kids into strong independent thinkers.</p>

        <p>This is getting a bit off topic but I wonder why we are so smart? I researched antinatalism and in response to it I wonder that question. No animal comes close to perceiving reality in the way we do. We have some pretty smart animals such as Elephants and Dolphins, but humans seem to be in another league altogether. Elephants and dolphins may have great memories and social bonds, but they don’t have history, they lack tradition. They lack culture, they lack religion. Humans are so very different than other animals.This is what gives us pleasure and pain beyond the scope of any other animal. When you look into the eyes of a chimp and see those beady black eyes you can tell the human element is lacking. </p>
<p>I feel we have a greater purpose in the end rather than decomposition. I cannot prove this to be the case, but neither can I prove it not to be. If I didn’t have this enduring belief I’d probably end up like the NPCs around me, with a sycophant nature because my only purpose in life would be to satisfy my desires. </p>
<p>Regardless what our purpose is the government restricting our autonomy will make it harder for us to understand what it is.</p>

        <p>Deep. Some think we bred with fallen angels because of <a href="http://www.fallenangels-ckquarterman.com/parts-of-modern-dna-derived-from-nephilim-the-product-of-fallen-angels-and-human-interbreeding/">foreign DNA</a>. Others think our DNA was sabotaged by said fallen angels because we only use <a href="https://www.awakeningpeople.com/12-strands-of-dna---our-spiritual-heritage.html">two strands out of 12</a>. Some think <a href="https://seanspeaks.co.uk/the-fallen-angels-humanity-and-god/">only a few bred with the angels</a>, which is why we have the 13 bloodlines preserving their DNA. David Icke <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a8A6Fb0bxQ">knows a lot</a> about these beliefs.</p>
<p>I just think we got a big brain lol.</p>

        <p>I believe that we are genetically engineered by aliens. “Real” humans are stupid creatures that hardly have enough to invent the things we have today so they used DNA from other species.  Some people get the best of that mix and become higher intelligence.</p>
<p>Either that or my real father is some kind of foreign entity.... my mother told me that others used to think that I was the son of the milk man and not her husband... was born with a lot of blonde hair almost white, a very large stork bite (birth mark of sorts). I’ve seen pictures I look like I was anointed to become some sort of wizard or religious figure. It looks like a big third eye in the photos</p>

        <p>I think Raven's / Crows are pretty close.  They develop unique cultures and tools, they teach their young tool use, the young refine and improve on those tools.  They mourn the dead and even investigate them.  They know good people from bad and educate each other on who is friend or foe and have the ability to figure out ways to make bad people's lives hell.  They can solve puzzles and problem solve.  They play, and even use and create tools precisely for that purpose.  When they observe something you can almost see the wheels turning in their heads.</p>
<p>An example of their vengeful cunning.  A church eventually moved their congregation after pissing off a group of crows.  Why?  Because the crows started taking the stem caps off their tires and flying off with them.  These crows did not similarly punish the people that took their place.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile I was on a flight over the weekend and overheard a mom tell her little kid to keep his mask on or the cops would come and arrest him. It was appalling. And don’t get me started on the double mask/face shield combo folks. Jesus Christ. I told my boyfriend that those people are never gonna come back.</p>

        <p>I’m at a point where I’m actually about to go buy a cheap hazmat suit, a face visor and triple mask.  Would be so funny to show up at random public places like bars dressed like that just to mock all this</p>

        <p>I taught my boy to think for himself from a young age. I showed him all kinds of documentaries and then discussed them with him and naively thought that because I'd done that, he'd be onboard with the ideas. Now he's 24 and even though he's familiar with ayahuasca, iboga and various other plant teachers, he doesn't seem to have a mind of his own at all.</p>
<p>Just saying</p>
