        <p>Hey black people,  we know your lives were mattering and stuff last week,  but we really need you right now to test this suspicious vaccine out and take one for the team,  since we said on the news that "you are disproportionally affected by the virus"</p>

        <p>Choice bits:</p>
<p>&rt; The COVID-19 Prevention Network, which is funded by the National Institute of Health, launched a website for people in the United States looking to volunteer for clinical trials as a few vaccines are ready for phase 3.</p>
<p>&rt; Phase 3 is meant to determine how likely it is the vaccine prevents new infections, so the best candidates will be people who haven’t already been exposed to the virus but are at high risk to contract the coronavirus (COVID-19). Earlier trials used smaller groups and were used to determine the proper dose of the vaccine and to monitor any safety concerns.</p>
<p>&rt; People interested in volunteering will be asked to fill out a questionnaire meant to determine how likely they are to contract the coronavirus, with questions focusing on race, occupation and how many people they’re exposed to on a regular basis, with an emphasis of recruiting people from communities that have been hit hardest from the virus.</p>
<p>&rt; For an example of what to expect if you’re accepted into one of these trials, the first late-stage vaccine trial will randomly assign half its 30,000 volunteers the vaccine made by the biotechnology company, Moderna, while the other half will receive placebos.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Volunteers will receive two injections spaced a month apart, have seven appointments over a two-year period to have blood drawn and their noses swabbed, keep a diary of symptoms over the same time period and be available for weekly check-in phone calls.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; The trial is expected to start in late July with at least five other large vaccine trials expected to be run through the COVID-19 Prevention Network and its more than 100 clinical trial sites.</p>
<p>Check out my bolded statement. This trial is expected to last around two years, starting from July. Isn't that telling? Of course, there are other currently ongoing trials happening that suggest their vaccine will come out in late 2020 or 2021, but still. If more trials take years to complete, do the governing bodies expect to continue this for 2+ years?</p>

        <p>It's more theater.  This vaccine won't be around anytime soon. Coronavirus isnt new, yet this one so important that all these initiatives are being taken. Sadly people are so scared and stupid that they can't see that this is a scam</p>

        <p>Phase 3 trials can continue even after a vaccine was deemed working and authorized for human use though. For instance, while it was demonstrated that it is efficient it's not exactly clear how long the effect lasts (does one need boosters and if yes then how often) and the initial participants continue to be monitored.</p>
