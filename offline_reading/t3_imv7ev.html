    <strong>Letter writing campaigns</strong>
    <p><p>Does writing to elected officials still work? Is email ok or is mail still read? </p>
<p>I feel bad that I haven’t taken the time to contact a single politician with my opinion on the lockdown. <strong>I’d like to hear from people who have.</strong></p>
<p>The one interesting thing I’ve seen is my Illinois state Senator is running a lot of polls about the election. I told a survey over the phone that a candidate that stops this lockdown would have my vote. I’m getting subsequent online polls and now they have lockdown questions. </p>
<p>The pro lockdown paranoid types cannot be the ones creating these policies. Our legislators need to know the old normal has to come back. Why is nobody worried about record high unemployment since WWII??</p>
<p>What’s the best way to start a letter writing campaign?</p></p>

        <p>I emailed my county supervisor a few months ago. He actually responded, and was straightforward and thoughtful. I was pleased to even get a response. I think it's important the we reach out to our state local government more often--to balance out the screeching of the doomers.</p>
