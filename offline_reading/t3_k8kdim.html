    <strong>I want to know more about the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>I’m not strictly antivax but this one is suspicious and I feel like it’s not talked about directly. From my current understanding, it seems it is novel in that it directly alters human rna. Does anybody know potential ramifications for that? Has it ever been done before and why or why not? </p>
<p>A rushed vaccine in under a year sounds risky enough. Getting ex war criminals to take it on national tv in order to quell the population is worse. And wait...it alters dna?? </p>
<p>No thanks. I want to know more about the possible mal effects specifically, relative to other vaccines. </p>
<p>Anybody have any info? Thanks a ton!</p></p>

        <p>Normally they would study the effects for years. If you take the vaccine early, you are phase 4 of the trials. What we do know from early results is that it won't prevent you from getting the virus but is supposed to prevent you from becoming symptomatic... by giving you side effects that could be worse than just getting the symptoms naturally. So what's the point again?</p>

        <p>I’m in the same boat as you. The vaccine can’t alter DNA that’s impossible but it doesn’t make me less suspicious. I’m not strictly against vaccines as a concept I’m just skeptical of this one in particular for many reasons and I don’t want to be in the first group to get it.</p>

        <p>The wording on the CDC website is nebulous and doesn’t really get to it imo. They outright claim that it doesn’t interact with our dna at all, or enters the nucleus of our cells etc. But they also explain that the vaccine provides instructions for our cells to create a specific protein that triggers an immune response against Covid. Okay, but wtf are these instructions and if they don’t enter our dna how do our cells adopt them and use them? </p>

        <p>Vernon Coleman spoke about it briefly, I think it was him anyway. That when the dna is being coerced into making these proteins it is removing its ability to do what it would normally be doing, in turn not allowing normal function to happen. The quote was along the lines of, its not whats it is doing but what the body won't be doing in its place.</p>

        <p>RNA used for protein creation does not enter the nucleus, all protein creation is in the cytoplasm and not the nucleus. </p>
<p>The RNA is the instruction, the cells dont adopt them, they are literally a blueprint used to make proteins within the cell but outside the nucleus.</p>

        <p>Idk about the rest but I wanted to clarify that a virus having RNA instead of DNA isn't uncommon. It's called a retrovirus. HIV is another retrovirus. I am guessing all coronaviruses are retroviruses. But that doesn't mean Covid-19 and HIV have many similarities beyond that.</p>
<p>A virus attacks cells by using the cell to copy its DNA (or in this case RNA) and synthesize the proteins that make up the virus. It uses the host cell to replicate. Viruses aren't alive and cannot replicate on their own like cells can. Unlike bacteria, which are cells, and thus "living" organisms.</p>
<p>In this process the cell usually dies, as most viruses cause the cell to lyse, thus releasing the copies back into your system to latch onto other cells.</p>
<p>Viruses are also specific to types of cells. Covid-19 attacks lung cells, which is why it is more directly spread via things like coughing. </p>
<p>The virus having RNA isn't very practically different from having DNA. In layman's terms you can think of RNA as sort of like an analog of DNA, its just opposite and composed of different nucleotides. It does serve a different function but that's irrelevant to this conversation at hand.</p>
<p>A vaccine has to have the virus parts, including the genetic code (so the RNA).</p>
<p>It also usually has an adjuvant in order to heighten your immune response, in order to create more antibodies.</p>
<p>In other words, if I coughed on you, and I had a virus, you may or may not actually ever reproduce that virus. Your innate immune system might just kick it out. In that case you would not develop antibodies.</p>
<p>For a vaccine to work you would need to develop antibodies, hence the need for an adjuvant.</p>
<p>And that's also why you can be exposed to covid and not have any immunity or antibodies. You may just not be susceptible to it for whatever reason - genetics, environment, any number of factors.</p>
<p>In my opinion the concern is mostly in the wild-type virus potentially interacting with the adjuvant and other vaccine components, and unknown genetic factors, to create a potentially dangerous response. This would potentially take years to notice in large scale, which is both why the rushed vaccine is concerning, and why you should probably wait to get it.</p>

        <p>I’d also like to know more. Every fucking tweet I see questioning this vaccine is rebutted with a rehearsed paragraph about how most of the 10 years spent on vaccines is waiting for funding, paperwork, basically sitting around doing nothing. 
They also tell you you’re anti-science and “not listening to the experts” when there are PLENTY of experts against this? 
And to top it off we have Bill Gates who has proudly spoken about how he plans to depopulate the planet with vaccines for the past decade. How do you depopulate with vaccines if their sole purpose is to stop you from getting sick? Why are we the crazy ones for asking questions?</p>

        <p>Ha we don’t have much real data to go off of yet about side effects so everything is pretty much conjecture and speculation. </p>
<p>We have never made an mRNA vaccine before so there are a lot of unknowns. </p>
<p>Triggering an autoimmune disease is probably the biggest worry though, from a theoretical standpoint. I don’t believe they have had any actual cases of autoimmune disease in any of the mRNA trials to this point- we have to wait for them to publish their data before we can say anything more.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, the chance of triggering a life-threatening autoimmune disease like guillain-barre from the flu vaccine is estimated at about 1 in 10million. Whereas if you catch the actual flu, the chances of getting guillain barre are at least 10 times higher.</p>
