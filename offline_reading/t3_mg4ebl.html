        <p>&rt;They take out appendixes when all the evidence says it's not appendicitis</p>
<p>Can you explain this?</p>
<p>I had my appendix out and I think they knew for sure it was appendicitis. Well, they claimed that via CT scan they could see it was on the verge of rupturing. My theory since then has been</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I did indeed need to have it removed since it had reached a critical stage, but</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It never would have developed in the first place had I not been on a typical modern diet as a kid, and been given too many antibiotics, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could have easily "cured" the appendicitis without surgery if I knew what I knew now. As in, it was "chronic appendicitis" where I had a few flare ups of increasing intensity leading up to the final one. I could have ceased any antibiotics, cut out sugar or carbs for a little bit, fasted, consumed some fermented foods, etc, or some combination thereof.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Speaking of (3), has appendicitis become less common since the mainstreaming of probiotics?</p>
<p>(mainstreaming aka the pharma industry and regulators figured out how to turn a profit on something that is available naturally via fermented foods).</p>

        <p>Ah okay thanks for answering. That's messed up especially if this is still case, even after all the discoveries about the microbiome, and the resulting plausible theories of the appendix' function. I guess appendectomy is a profitable procedure and they can still get away with it.</p>
<p>I just remembered another detail in my case; I think they only went ahead with the CT scan because I didn't have "rebound pain" and yet I said the (constant) pain was extreme. If you had the, "rebound" pain though I think they maybe just considered that good enough evidence that it was severe appendicitis, justifying surgery. I don't know how factual this is, if the "rebound" pain is indeed selective.</p>

<p>Good to hear this from someone working in (I assume "mainstream") healthcare. What happens if you bounce these opinions off your colleagues, do they just react emotionally?</p>

        <p>This is ok public healthcare too so not about profits. They just have that attitude that they know better and don't give a fuck about any issues it causes the patient long term. They love dismissing things and feeling superior.</p>
<p>Well I've only briefly mentioned some of my ideas haha, but tbh I'd day most I've mentioned it too agree with me, although it could be selection bias since I don't just say it to everyone. But yeah, it's just a system that rolls along and no one can really change it due to inertia.</p>

        <p>&rt;stop eating carbs. </p>
<p>While I agree there is an overabundance of simple carbs, even with pure ketosis you need carbs to function. </p>
<p>A healthier approach would be to limit sugar and other simple carb intake and get your main carb source from rice/ potatoes (not french fries come on now) instead of grains. Unless its pure oatmeal, because that shit is surprisingly healthy if you're able to digest gluten. Bread on the other hand is often unhealthy as fuck especially if you're american due to added sugar. European bread is healthy only if you get the fresh wholegrain loafs as opposed to the white or "brown" loafs. The brown loafs are literally just white but coloured brown. Hot dog buns/ hamburger bread / crossaints etc are never healthy.</p>

<p>And you're wrong and the zerocarb guy is right, overall. Watch Amber O'Hearn's lectures on youtube. They are super information dense, no gimmicks. She was trained as a computer scientist before getting into her research of zerocarb, so she puts together really concise and carefully reasoned talks. If you care about nutrition or think you know better it's basically a must, to watch her talks.</p>

        <p>thats because if you eat your veggies and nuts you still get carbs.   </p>
<p>A keto diet isn't for everyone and is not without risks. Mind you if you're severly overweight /obese doing keto with the help of doctors and dieticians comes with less risks than being overweight, but some people should just not try it out. It's an extremely strict diet and even in my meat loving bodybuilding days was unobtainable for me. It's INSANE how little vegetables you can actually eat, not even starting about fruit, a single banana will throw you out of ketosis and you have to redo the whole keto flu thing for the coming days. <br>
Not starting about the missing fibres, having to limit both most veggies and all grains makes this hard to keep up with.<br>
If you can keep this up and never leave ketosis GREAT, seriously amazing, but for 99% of people this is just not feasible and honestly diminishing returns. </p>
<p>Most people just eat like pure shit. Eliminating fried food and other trans fat foods/ artificial sugary food and processed carbs would make the population as a whole a lot healthier and that is with a breakfast of yoghurt + nuts , and either a similar warm meal of potatoes/rice + meat ( no red meat and 1-3 days a week meatless+ farmed fish every now and then) and veggies or lunch with whole grain brown bread and warm dinner.   </p>
<p>Also   </p>
<p>"your body is perfectly capable of manufacturing any and all glucose it needs for itself" <br>
keto is 5% carbs intake. if you seriously would go 100% without carbs your body would start transforming muscle mass into glucose just for your brain and nerves to survive.</p>

        <p>Funny running into a zerocarb person here. zerocarb is the one thing which will make <em>anyone</em> react emotionally, no matter what their background.</p>
<p>I had a doctor look at his feet and say, "you shouldn't do it for long, you need the antioxidants from plants". He was otherwise super open minded but I think everyone who eats carbs has an emotional attachment.</p>
<p>Good on you for 3 yrs. I eat some carbs pretty regularly for the past two years and feel kind of shit. Although way better than I felt before zerocarb. It was therapeutic in that sense.</p>

        <p>Your body cant make glucose out of thin air, if you take in zero carbs it turns proteins into glucose, more often than not it means your body will eat up muscle mass in order to maintain nerve and brain health. 
If you've been literally zero carb you need to get your vitamins checked right now, because there's no way that can be good without legumes, nuts and veggies. </p>
<p>Are you on a pure carnivorous diet? For some people including those with Crohn's disease this might be beneficial, perhaps you have an underlying condition you unknowingly threated, but that doesn't mean your exception turned into a rule.</p>

<p>This isn't even historically accurate. Do you know what a carnivore is? Human beings since the earliest known tribal groups have been omnivores. You're just completely ignoring the gatherer part in hunter/gatherer. Early civilizations settled in order to have stable agricultural access: they planted plants to eat and raised livestock to eat.</p>
<p>It may be possible to survive on an all-meat diet, but that doesn't mean humans are carnivores. They can just as easily survive on an all-plant diet. That doesn't make them herbivores. Humans have always been omnivores.</p>

<p>I'm not going to argue semantics with you. If you want optimal health, eat an all-animal foods diet. If you don't, do whatever the fuck you want.</p>

        <p>Heart disease and diabetes can be reversed by a whole foods plant based diet. Plants have an abundance of micro nutrients. </p>
<p>About ancestral diets, our teeth and digestive tracts closely resemble primates who are omnivores, but 90% of their diet is plants. They also eat bugs and some smaller animals.</p>
<p>You also have to look at cultures. It appears that inuit cultures did survive mainly off of meat and fish like you purport. Other cultures, I believe in japan is one, where many in these smaller communities live to over 100 they eat mainly plants. </p>
<p>It's not as easy as saying optimal health is all about meat because that's simply not true.</p>

        <p>Heart disease can be controlled by WFPB only because you're not triggering the Randle Cycle as much. However since the foods you'd be eating on a WFPB are nutritionally inferior to animal foods you are likely to develop other issues over time, as well as spending an inordinate amount of time eating and shitting. </p>
<p>It <em>is</em> as easy as saying meat/animal foods are the best foods for humans. The problem is the colossal amount of misinformation out there that says otherwise means people have to work it out for themselves.</p>

        <p>Well literally don't even have the capability to digest cellulose, we can't be omnivores. Simple as that. For plants to be consumable by humans, historically we processes the hell out of them using fermentation or boiling/soaking for days, mashing and then baking.</p>
<p>Plants are toxic to us and contain tonnes of anti-nutrients, early humans were smart enough to know this and would never eat a salad or briefly boiled veggies.  Also 95% of the fruit and veggies we know now don't actually exist in nature.</p>

        <p>Yeah the government having a really shitty track record in regards to public health makes me pretty skeptical about everything relating to covid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thalidomide promoted as an anti-morning sickness drug. Didn't work, caused birth defects.</li>
<li>Theranos praised as a "lab of the future", ended up being the biggest scam in american history</li>
<li>Agent Orange used as a herbicide, whoops US gov't admits several decades later it caused birth defects.</li>
<li>Lobotomies used to "solve" mental illness, whoops turns out poking the brain causes severe brain damage wow shocking</li>
<li>Video games make kids violent, whoops the lawyer who pushed all of this ended up being barred from practicing law.</li>
<li>War on drugs will get drugs off the streets in LA, whoops it was actually the CIA funding the drug trade also we killed the journalist who exposed it haha stop asking questions.</li>
<li>Prescribe a shit ton of kids with ritalin because they can't pay attention in class, whoops turns out school's just that boring and they don't actually have ADHD please stop asking questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this time, <em>this time</em>, please trust us on our Covid response.</p>

        <p>True, but this statement, “The FDA has regulatory processes in place to facilitate the development of COVID-19 vaccines that meet the FDA's rigorous scientific standards.” , is a far cry from the “not approved” status of thalidomide</p>

        <p>That fact that it is still “in process” makes everyone taking the vaccine currently part of phase 3 trials. Which is fine, if you’re informed. I will personally not set myself on fire to keep others warm.</p>

        <p>sorry to hear that. the way the US treats it's veterans is heartbreaking stuff. once the government was done with them they threw them to the wolves back at home, tons of homelessness, sucidies, cancer. happened in vietnam and most recently going on with the Iraq war and the "burn pits" soldiers were exposed to over there. sad stuff</p>

        <p>Oh, I feel ya. I've lost friends and been blocked by family members. But I've also made quite a few casuals actually think for themselves through FB. I use my real name and keep my friends list small. It's usually friends of friends that I get into discussions with, but they're usually decent discussions since we kinda know each other. My brother tells me to get off FB all the time, but the way I use it, it doesn't completely ruin my hope for humanity like it does him</p>

        <p>I just dont understand how people could ever think smoking was healthy. Just look at how the body reacts to the very first time the take a puff, they start to violently cough. Obviously the body is trying to get something dangerous out.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah bring this up in any argument they will not address it. So many people have been betrayed by paid for science. Not fucking doing it. There's always going to be another virus. By their logic ten years from now people will take 100+ vaccines by the time they're 18. Whatever those 'minimal side effects' they keep down playing are will definitely add up when you're taking ten vaccines every flu season.  🤔</p>

        <p>My boyfriend is currently in the psych ward (arrested and committed by NYPD without cause). They've been pumping him with drugs since the day he got there. The drugs only make him feel sluggish and cause him tremors, but the "experts" will not listen to him. It's essentially a fluffy prison. Nothing they are doing is actually helping him, and they do not want to release him.</p>

<p>You want to take the media at their word, go right ahead, I won't stop you. But don't stop me from taking the time to understand the problem and possibly coming to a different conclusion, or better yet, listening to <em>other</em> experts that disagree with yours.</p>
