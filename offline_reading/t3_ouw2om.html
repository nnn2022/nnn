    <strong>Can we talk about r/ontario?</strong>
    <p><p>I was just banned from r/ontario for saying that I'm never going to take the vaccine. The idiots are pushing for 100% vaccination and stroking each other off to the Delta Variant. I followed my comment up with mentioning Covid-19 had a 99.9+% chance of survival for my age group.</p>
<p>These pro lockdown cnts don't represent Ontario or define my province as a whole. I lived in the province of Ontario my whole life. They only let the pro vaccine mandate cnts speak!</p>
<p>When we speak out they erase us! That's why they're everywhere circle jerking with thousands of upvotes and awards, they erase us Covid skeptics! They just delete us. The moment we open our mouths or even hint at mocking the narrative they hit the delete key. </p>
<p>That sub socially engineers itself to represent Ontario as a pro government vaccine circle jerk! All the city/state/province/country subs do NOT represent their populations because any population thinks widely differently when an open healthy debate is permitted.</p></p>

        <p>THIS IS THE POST THEY BANNED ME FOR:</p>
<p><em>I've swore as a healthy 25 year old man to NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER get the Covid-19 vaccine. I'm never going to get it, you can't persuade people like me, no matter what you type here on an internet forum, you couldn't pay me a million bucks $$$. It'll be the year 2023 and I STILL wouldn't even have one dose. Covid-19 has a 99.8% full recovery survival rate for people like me. Call me anything you want, I want to let you know that people like me exist, and I'm a stubborn mule. It's been 2 years of the big scary pandemic and I'm still standing tall and breathing amazingly, haven't been to a doctor or hospital in over 5 years.</em></p>

        <p>Ok, let's be clear... Reddit makes it's ad revenue from Ads and eyeballs. Eyeballs and Ads require user-generated content, discussion, etc.</p>
<p>I have been banned from several 'pro-vaxx' subs because I post here.  </p>
<p>Guess what?  I just unsubscribe (unjoin) those subs.  It is reducing the clutter in my feeds. It is generating FEWER pageviews for Redditt and reduces their ad revenue. Because my eyeballs see fewer and fewer posts worth viewing each day.</p>
<p>I get more of what I like (conservative, pro-gun, freedom) posts and less of the nonsense.</p>
<p>Getting banned from so many places has made Redditt MUCH more enjoyable to me.</p>
<p>Let them cut off their nose to spite their face and move on.</p>

        <p>I was banned from r/Ontario back in January for commenting that there will not be any freezer trucks used to store dead bodies that the OP claimed there would be. I’ve messaged the mods at least 10 times about the ban and not one response. Horrible people on that sub</p>

        <p>It's a disturbing sub for sure. I just saw a post about how unvaccinated people are "entitled anti-vaxxers" who take up hospital beds for the rest. And people are applauding this guy...</p>
