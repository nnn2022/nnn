        <p>1) "Perfect is the enemy of the good" does not apply to spelling mistakes. </p>
<p>2) I don't really see how it's not self evident how moronic it is to use this quote in this context. We're not talking about people getting burned at the stake. We're not talking about brutally oppressive religious authority proclaiming dogma as truth. </p>

<p>Ok. In a way, what we're seeing among the denialists/anti-vaxxers is the very religious dogma that Voltaire was railing against. Just because you don't recognize this dogma doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</p>

        <p>Okay? Candide is very specific about what it’s criticizing, so I was interested in knowing what you took away from it vis a vis the current topic. </p>

        <p>The reason I used Candide was because that was perhaps Voltaire's most famous writing. I would expect someone who had never written his works to start with the most well known. </p>
<p>The insinustion was that someone could read ANY Voltaire and have a better understanding of his works than you. </p>
<p>This implies, in turn, that you have absolutely no knowledge on the subject. I, of course, don't know this to be true, and the insinuation was meant as a form of hyperbole for the sake of amusing myself.</p>
<p>In a similar manner, I was planning on replying to your original comment with the following...</p>
<p>"You are correct. I left out the whole context, and feel ashamed to have misrepresented him. Let me correct that.</p>
<p>'It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong, except of course if there is a pandemic going on, in which case it is, in fact the safest course.' -Foaltear"</p>
<p>But now knowing that you need the subtleties of my discourse explained to you, I feel it would take too long to explain my intention with such a post. </p>
<p>I do hope you are enjoying this exchange as much as I am.</p>

        <p>That's right! Look at all this pro-choice dogma!</p>
<p>As of 2016, no lipid nano particle-mRNA (LNP) vaccines had ever been tested in humans because of “unanswered questions,” and also because--this is important--the tolerance for side effects in healthy individuals is very low. In other words, with cancer patients who are already dying, doctors will do more experimental treatments to try to save a life, but they don't want to put an already healthy person at greater risk. Note that the corona vaccines have mRNA wrapped in LNP in order to deliver the code through the body’s defenses. </p>
<p>See the 2016 study "mRNA vaccine delivery using lipid nanoparticles" for details (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439223/).</p>
<p>Furthermore, one of the best arguments against forced vaccination with experimental medical treatments has to do with historically known side effects from previous attempts at mRNA vaccinations, which all failed.</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed medical papers below share about historically known adverse side effects from attempts at mRNA vaccination that were SUPPOSED to be addressed before experimenting on large portions of the population. It's ironic how all the adverse side effects being reported JUST HAPPEN to be the same side effects that medical journals were warning about BEFORE the pandemic. </p>
<p>Sources:</p>
<p>• “mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology,” a study less than two years old at the time of the outbreak.
https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243</p>
<p>• “Nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines induce potent T follicular helper and germinal center B cell responses” from summer of 2018
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5987916/</p>
<p>• “A Comparison of Plasmid DNA and mRNA as Vaccine Technologies” , one of the most recent major pre-COVID medical studies about this published in June 2019, and provides a clear overview of vaccines technologies as recent as six months prior to the first SARS-CoV-2 case. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631684/</p>
<p>Selections from the above sources:</p>
<p>• Ex vivo mRNA cancer treatment are the only mRNA treatments that have been effective in the past, and as of 2019, scientists had not figured out how to make in vitro mRNA prophylactic treatments (the current vaccines) effective or without safety concerns. </p>
<p>• Direct injection of mRNA is comparatively rapid and cost-effective, but it does not yet allow precise and efficient cell-type-specific delivery.</p>
<p>• The majority of past investigations focused on DNA-based vaccines because of concerns about mRNA instability and the inefficiency of in vitro delivery.</p>
<p>• The instability of mRNA has been a significant reason for the lack of interest in mRNA as a drug in the past.</p>
<p>• mRNA vaccines are inflammatory in nature which increases risk for toxicity.</p>
<p>• A possible concern is that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce responses which have been associated not only with inflammation but also with autoimmunity.</p>
<p>• mRNA inhibition of antigen can have negative immune responses.</p>
<p>• The immune system response has the potential to be harmful – RNA has long been known to be an immunologically active molecule, and mRNA has a number of immunostimulatory mechanisms, which may be detrimental for mRNA used for vaccines.</p>
<p>• Recent human trials (pre COVID) have demonstrated both moderate and severe injection site or systemic reactions for different mRNA platforms. </p>
<p>• While some preclinical studies have generated optimism about the prospects and advantages of mRNA-based vaccines, two of the more recent clinical reports led to more tempered expectations. In both trials, immunogenicity was more modest in humans than was expected based on animal models, and the side effects were not trivial.</p>
<p>• Liver toxicity was observed in pre-clinical studies with one potential mRNA therapeutic delivered in lipid nanoparticles for Crigler-Najjar syndrome… These were serious enough to halt the work with this particular entity.</p>
<p>• This observed toxicity may be concerning for vaccines as well, since even live replicating viruses and viral vector vaccines (which generally are more immunogenic than subunit vaccines) need repeat dosing</p>
<p>• There were reported toxicities seen with the rabies mRNA vaccine that included limited systemic adverse effects (AEs) for the majority of patients (78%) and even grade three AEs in ~10% of patients following doses of mRNA via different routes. This was despite the conclusions from early studies showing that this vaccine was generally thought to be safe.</p>
<p>• Known potential safety concerns that have been identified as needing to be evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies (as of six months before the first case of COVID) include: </p>
<p>• local and systemic inflammation</p>
<p>• the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen</p>
<p>• stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies </p>
<p>• potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components.</p>
<p>• Another potential safety issue derives from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination, which has been shown to contribute to oedema [oedema is “excessive accumulation of fluid, mainly water, in the tissue spaces of the body”]</p>
<p>• Another study showed that extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation [blood clots]</p>
<p>• There are nine areas that scientists have noted need continued research and development for mRNA vaccines, as well as nine “Issues to be addressed for clinical efficacy and safety of mRNA related to inflammation,” including:</p>
<p>• “Potential toxicity of mRNA due to inherent mRNA inflammatory activity, use of unnatural modified nucleoside, and the formulations;</p>
<p>• “Several pathways of RNA-induced inflammation: TLR 3, 7, 8, plus cytoplasmic pathways</p>
<p>• “Known toxicities of drugs containing unnatural modified nucleosides</p>
<p>• “Potential mitigation or enhancement due to formulation of the mRNA</p>
<p>• “Will anti-self RNA antibodies be generated and play any role in autoimmune diseases?</p>
<p>• “Design of clinical trials to detect inflammation/toxicity due to mRNA”</p>
<p>The general conclusion of all these studies?</p>
<p>"Safety will therefore need continued evaluation as different mRNA modalities and delivery systems are utilized for the first time in humans and are tested in larger patient populations.”</p>
<p>Most studies that have been done have only sought to show that the vaccines are effective compared to not having a vaccine. I've looked and found hardly any research proving the safety of the vaccines, especially in regards to these known concerns that all the experts have warned about. The safety reports that have been provided are from the manufacturer to the FDA, so it would require FOIA requests to access. </p>
<p>If you have any medical journals or research showing how the above concerns were addressed with the current investigational vaccines, please share! I have not been able to find any. </p>
<p>In conclusion: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No one is seeking to discount that there have been promising and tangible developments in mRNA vaccines over recent years. The question is whether enough historical safety concerns have been solved in these jabs to apply indiscriminately across the entire population. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not only long-term effects, but understanding which populations have any adverse effect and WHY, which we don’t know. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The argument is not to try to prevent other people from taking the vaccine, but defending people’s right to opt out. Especially young and healthy individuals with almost no risk from covid. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arguing that any medical treatment be forced on someone puts the burden of proof on the coercing party to provide evidence of safety; it should be enough that a person has the right to deny any medical treatment, so “reasonable doubt” is more than enough reason to refuse, especially with the lack of safety data. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I mean, if that doesn't sound like dogma, what does?</p>

        <p>First off, couching all of this as "pro-choice" is cute, given the substantial overlap between anti-vaxxers and the religious right. But whatever.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;No one is seeking to discount that there have been promising and tangible developments in mRNA vaccines over recent years. The question is whether enough historical safety concerns have been solved in these jabs to apply indiscriminately across the entire population.</p>
<p>The published trials for these particular mRNA vaccines (which are, in fact, not the same as the ones that failed) demonstrate conclusively that acute toxicities are not causing significant issues with delivery. Long-term side effects obviously aren't known, but more data are coming all the time, and nothing of clinical concern has emerged.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>\&rt;This is not only long-term effects, but understanding which populations have any adverse effect and WHY, which we don’t know.</p>
<p>This is also true of almost every medical intervention. There is a risk of adverse events, and you often cannot predict who will experience them. Therefore, the benefit against the disease in question needs to be clear, which has so far been strongly the case with the vaccines.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>\&rt;The argument is not to try to prevent other people from taking the vaccine, but defending people’s right to opt out. Especially young and healthy individuals with almost no risk from covid.</p>
<p>This would be nice if we weren't, in this very moment, seeing the beginning of a spike in serious cases among children. I genuinely hope it comes to nothing.</p>
<p>And people already have a right to opt out. Courts are establishing that that's not going away, either. The real question emerging is whether people who opted out can suffer consequences, since they pose a risk to others in the form of incubating and helping the virus evolve.</p>
<p>I don't have a strong stance on this, other than to state that opting out is grossly irresponsible, and people who opt not to protect themselves either have nothing to lose, or are being ignorant of what they have to lose. That's their choice, and it's my choice to tell them that they're acting selfishly and irresponsibly.</p>

<p>We do not lack safety data, full stop. No one is forcing you to take it. You will never be comfortable with the safety, because you've already convinced yourself it's not safe enough.</p>

<p>Then why are America's Frontline Doctors, who ARE providing clinical concerns, being censored? Are you scared of their data? </p>
<p>&rt;This is also true of almost every medical intervention. There is a risk of adverse events, and you often cannot predict who will experience them. Therefore, the benefit against the disease in question needs to be clear, which has so far been strongly the case with the vaccines.</p>
<p>Long-term studies help identify those who are at greater risk from the treatment. These studies are not completed. However, the Israel Pfizer studied showed minor benefit for elderly populations, but not younger. Ironically, the almost completely vaccinated population of Israel is having covid outbreaks among the vaccinated. Kind of like Dr. Malone predicted. </p>
<p>&rt;This would be nice if we weren't, in this very moment, seeing the beginning of a spike in serious cases among children. I genuinely hope it comes to nothing.</p>
<p>As do I, but asymptomatic cases are greatly different than symptomatic or hospitalized cases or death. If it's true that children are catching it, that's actually hopeful because they'll be able to develop natural immunity and not need vaccines.</p>
<p>&rt;And people already have a right to opt out. Courts are establishing that that's not going away, either. The real question emerging is whether people who opted out can suffer consequences, since they pose a risk to others in the form of incubating and helping the virus evolve. 
&rt;
&rt;I don't have a strong stance on this, other than to state that opting out is grossly irresponsible, and people who opt not to protect themselves either have nothing to lose, or are being ignorant of what they have to lose. That's their choice, and it's my choice to tell them that they're acting selfishly and irresponsibly. </p>
<p>The CDC came out with information that vaxxed and unvaxxed carry the same viral load so if there's any threat, it's the same from vaxxed or unvaxxed. Furthermore, evidence is emerging from doctors that using vaccinations in the middle of an outbreak creates conditions for variants to mutate. So the vaccinated pose a threat to other vaccinated in that sense. </p>
<p>Also, yes, I am selfish in that I've already survived the vid and the more data that comes out, the more I'm seeing doctors and scientists say that not only does natural immunity work, but I'm at greater risk for adverse side effects if I take the vaccine when I already have antibodies. I'm selfish because I actually guard my health and work hard to be fit. What moral system are you appealing to that asks me to sacrifice my hard-earned health for someone else? Christianity? Survival of the fittest?</p>
<p>&rt;We do not lack safety data, full stop. No one is forcing you to take it. You will never be comfortable with the safety, because you've already convinced yourself it's not safe enough.</p>
<p>Fine, I'll amend the statement: "especially when the emerging and historical safety data show cause for caution and concern." I read the Pfizer and Moderna clinical studies and they did not account for any of the historic concerns I addressed in their literature. However, all those historic concerns are appearing as side effects in the vaccinated. The burden of proof is now on them to "show me the science," but they only have to show ongoing safety reports to the FDA, not the public. If it's so safe, what are they hiding?</p>
<p>Also, I am being forced: my options are get jabbed, forfeit my Title VII rights, or lose my job. If you don't see a problem with that, then it's no wonder you're fine with the government trampling on Constitutional rights.</p>

<p>Also, there is one thing that would probably convince me to get vaccinated: if all the vaccine manufacturers agreed to take full liability for any adverse effects from the vaccines. If there's only a small number of people with adverse reactions, then their billions in dollars of profit from the vaccines should be more than enough to cover any medical bills and disability payments for injured parties. I want them to stand behind their science with their money. None of this CICP or VICP pittance.</p>
