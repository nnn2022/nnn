        <p>(I’ll be downvoted for saying this but what I say here is being said explicitly by the UN and others.  It’s not a conspiracy.  It’s out in the open now.)</p>
<p>Eventually vaccine passports WILL be global, linked into an international system.  Everyone, in every country, will have “vaccine passports” which will be expanded into biometric ID cards with your electronic money, health records, travel records, etc.  All part of the global reset.</p>

        <p>It's too easy for the country X to not comply with it, and give the vaccination passport to everyone, saying that COVID vaccine was supposedly administered with measles vaccine to the whole population starting this year. </p>
<p>There are 200 countries in the world, and there's no way all 200 will participate in this BS. The weak point of all conspiracies is to ensure universal participation, which is almost always impossible, because people just love to throw other people under the upcoming bus.</p>

<p>The US federal reserve is about 100 years old.  Do you know how long it took until almost every country in earth had its currency and central bank connected to the US Fed?</p>
<p>When you have global power you can get shit done quickly and almost universally.  The Globalists are now fused with not only Big Tech and Corporations but also the international Security State and Intelligence Services and Big Pharma.  Will there be holdouts against the coming global tyranny?  Yes.  How many?  I don’t know but not a lot and it will be very very hard for countries to resist.</p>

<p>So many don't do it to this day. I can name Cuban national peso for example.</p>
<p>Also, US Fed was a great central bank, much much better than the alternative (the bank of USSR), so it's a no brainer they got into a leadership position. Now in age of crypto they are a bit dated (and won't rule for much longer) but that's besides the point.</p>
<p>The WHO is no US Fed. United Nations is a club of people who couldn't make successful political careers in their own countries. I can entertain the possibility that China will rule the world in 21st century, but I am definitely sure the UN will not rule anything ever.</p>

<p>You mean a nation under embargo by the US for decades where its citizens can't travel....</p>
<p>Now imagine it's almost every country doing it.</p>

        <p>Vaccine passports are once again another means to cave to those with the lowest risk tolerance. Who took issue with people being unmasked? Those with the lowest risk tolerance. Who’s demanding vaccine passports so they know they’re not around unvaccinated people? Those with the lowest risk tolerance. </p>
<p>We decided that participation in society in its entirety cannot be interrupted, but came down to a decision point on who should be inconvienced if not outright excluded. We could either accommodate those with lowest risk tolerance (require masks, mandatory vaccinations, vaccine passports, etc.) or choose not to inconvenience those with the higher risk tolerances (make masks and vaccinations optional). If we are going to continue to function, we need to draw the line and tell those low tolerance people to either stay home or accept being around the maskless and unvaccinated. We’ve accommodated the risk averse people for too long. It’s time to give them an ultimatum.</p>

<p>I mean, I agree obviously.</p>
<p>But the problem is that the low risk tolerance people are protected by Fake News Media, Big Tech, Federal Government, Deep State, CCP, Wall Street, Corporations, Hollywood, and Woke SJW Mob.</p>
