    <strong>Why did the CDC change the IFR to almost 0.7% from a much lower 0.26%?</strong>
    <p><p>And which IFR is more 'accurate' so to speak? I'm a  little suspicious that they both raised the IFR by several times and removed age stratification as well</p></p>

        <p>The Spanish CDC said 0.26%. WHO said 0.6% and I have no idea about the Ameicans though. </p>
<p>Intresting fact </p>
<p>If you do calculations with the 0.3% mortality rate on places which have reached herd immunity like Sweden using confirmed deaths, only 20% infected are needed to slow down the spread for good. 
Did the same calculation for my country thinking it will be over soon to be met with just 2%. It will be a long ride thanks to lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Bulgaria, 500 fatalities. The daily numbers are stable and to me it seems like there is downward trend, but math is math and I calculate only 2%.</p>

        <p>Even 0.3% is likely way too high. The huge variance in IFR is caused mainly by two factors, how deaths are counted (over counting in most places) and how much penetration into long term care, nursing homes / healthcare systems the virus had. If you can prevent that (or just get lucky) and don't over count deaths, the IFR is likely below 0.1%.</p>

<p>Global data from the top epidemiologist says 0.04 % IFR for under 70 years old... And that's counting the deaths that aren't caused by covid but the person tested " positive " for covid, so they were counted as a covid death. Median age of death range is in the low 80s for plenty of countries, which that in itself is very suspicious. According to the data, it mostly seems to kill very old people in nursing homes with only a few months left to live.</p>
<p>True IFR must be extremely tiny if you consider only true covid deaths, not all the ones that were added to pad the stats and add deaths... Even with those added on, it's IFR is still two times smaller then the Influenza flu.</p>
<p>In the US, more than 46,000 hospitalizations occurred in children (aged &lt;18 years) in the 2018-2019 Flu season, yet covid is barely in the hundreds.</p>
<p>Many people know covid was developed to be this killer virus and give way to enact permanent lockdowns, roll in the " new normal " to pave way to a great reset and " sustainable " agenda. But the global deep state literally picked the most non lethal virus they could of conjured in this covid hoax. It's so non lethal governments across the world are starving their own hospitals, pressuring through financial rewards hospitals and pathologist to put down covid as cause of death on anybody.</p>
<p>US hospitals get paid 13k per covid death, at a time when they weren't allowed to perform any surgical procedures or see much patients... You do the math</p>
