        <p>I came across this story in the bachelor sub because a former contestant of the Bachelorette apparently found out he tested positive for COVID while he was driving his car. It sounds like he had some sort of anxiety attack and lost consciousness while he was driving. He crashed his car into a pole. Luckily, he wasn't hurt too badly and no one else was hurt. I don't know too much about this guy but he appears to be perfectly healthy and young. I just don't understand the fear mongering over this virus to the point that people are crashing their damn cars over it.</p>
<p>Edit - here is his Instagram post about it - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CHbc_vJh_H4/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CHbc_vJh_H4/</a>. I guess he found out he was positive and started freaking out on the drive home. I mean..this is some serious fear mongering. And he apparently did "everything right". I kind of feel sorry for him but at the same time - he could have actually killed someone during his anxiety attack over nothing.</p>

        <p>Ridiculous. But I can see why he freaked out when you realize that getting COVID means you may as well have to show your whole path of movement and your medical records to everyone when you go out in public. Just look at the constant nagging to not refuse contact tracing. </p>
<p>I got an email from my skating club this morning, and the woman who wrote it (doctor who skates herself and has kids who do) said we have to contact her if we test positive so we can make a plan to come back to the rink at an appropriate time. This woman is not my doctor or my mother or a state health official, but she wants me to tell her about my health so she can make decisions for me? No thanks. I’m sure my regular doctor knows enough about COVID that SHE can tell me how long to self isolate and when to get back to activity if I get sick. Skating Mom can fuck off.</p>

        <p>How is this not a HIPAA violation?</p>
<p>My mom was fighting for legal custody of my half-sister against her emotionally abusive father. My sister’s dad has bipolar and a personality disorder, and has been nasty to my sister for the passed 9 years, causing PTSD and severe anxiety. My mom wasn’t even allowed to bring up his medically diagnosed issues in court because of HIPAA, but we are supposed to tell everyone about our sensitive medical information about COVID? How is that fair??</p>

        <p>When this all started I remember people in my area thinking they should know where COVID patients live. It’s definitely wrong. </p>
<p>I know when I worked in a law firm, we couldn’t have clients turn over medical records to the firm or have their doctor release them without a signed authorization. Basically saying John Doe Client has agreed to let Acme Law Firm request his records. We had to send a letter to the facility with the signed release from the client.</p>

        <p>So, COVID-19 terrifies him, but not the possibility of an auto accident, which has a much higher chance of killing him.</p>

        <p>Seriously. I want to comment on his Instagram post that he had more of a chance of being killed in the auto accident than due to COVID. And how lucky he is that he didn't kill someone else and that he should have pulled over when he felt himself losing control. But I won't even bother commenting because I know it will fall on deaf ears and I'll open myself up to harassment.</p>

        <p>If you post that, people know in their heart that you're right and therefore that they are being played, and I think that's why you get harassed. I think it's important to post that stuff. Having said that, I rarely dare to do it, but I'm grateful to the folks who do.</p>

        <p>Yeah...I hadn't spoken with my sister in a few months because we aren't close any more, but I did send her an email recently about a family matter and, in it, I mentioned a local grocery store that won't bother you if you don't wear a mask. I got back a very frosty "Well, WE wear our masks, so we will be sure not to shop there." She has two kids, my niece and nephew, who i adore, and I'm so disgusted that she has not--in EIGHT MONTHS--done ANY indie research or had one prick of conscience about forcing mask on to her kids. She is a fucking karen and I'm so finished with her. I'm so pissed on behalf of my niece and nephew. Ugh.</p>

        <p>I speak daily to people who perform contact tracing calls and 90% of cases i hear them describe the worst symptoms include fever and generally feeling like shit for a while. Loss of taste and smell is annoying but not dangerous. Sure every once in a while the patient (we call them an "Index") has more sever symptoms but them when you ask further or look into the case that index usually has  illnesses, medications, general poor health, old age etc. <br>
I dont think all the contact tracers i speak to (and there are a lot of them) have ever told me about a young, fit index who had more serious symptoms than feeling like crap for a week and maybe a little breathing trouble/constant cough that persists a bit. <br>
I can count on one hand the hospitalizations i've heard and i speak to 50+ (sometimes 100+ depending on the day) contact tracers who each handle multiple cases each day.   </p>

        <p>I had covid in March and I still have terrible lingering symptoms, you can google "long covid" or read /r/covidlonghaulers to find out more about it. 
My symptoms were mild the first week and got worse a month later. It happens to a small number of the covid infections (around 20 to 35%, different reports at the moment). 
My point is that I understand 100% the fear of catching it even being young because it fucked me up. Completely.</p>
<p>Edit: why the downvotes? I'm sharing my experience and you can easily find thousands of patients like me sharing our stories out there. I'm not trying to scare anyone, just sharing that covid (as many other viruses) can leave you with lingering symptoms</p>

        <p>You know that those symptoms can also be attributed to depression and other lockdown-induced mental health disorders.</p>
<p>But aside from that, having lingering symptoms is a thing with ALL respiratory viruses. It’s not unique to covid. I once had a cold that I never quite got out of for months. It happens.</p>

        <p>Same here..I had a terrible cold while I was pregnant. I felt like I was choking on my own snot. I bruised a rib during a coughing fit. Had to go to the hospital to be monitored and ended up being in so much pain from my bruised rib that I took pain medicine while 9 months pregnant (under a doctor's care, of course. The pain was so bad that it was more stressful to the baby if I didn't take anything). The cold lingered until after delivery, went away for a bit, then came back for another month or so. It sucked.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you has that experience too. I'm just sharing that after covid it can happen too. I've been in pain for 8 months at this point. 
I just wish this sub doesn't "cherry pick" which information to read. I'm not saying that you need to be scared but lingering symptoms after covid it's a real thing.</p>

        <p>My mental health is fine! I already spoke with several doctors and they agree that this is "post covid syndrome" and they don't know how to treat it yet. 
I don't understand the downvotes. I know that other viruses also have side effects, and that's not cool at all. 
Why would you ignore people suffering after covid? For me it's been 8 months off from work, full of pain. 
I don't wish this to anyone.</p>

        <p>If I get a fever and cough in the next few years, I'm not gonna bother to get tested. I'm gonna sleep it off like I do with every other illness. The fact is drilled into people's heads to run out and get tested over every little sniffle really is driving this insanity.</p>
