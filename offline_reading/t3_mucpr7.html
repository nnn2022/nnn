    <strong>As We All Know Canada Is fked. There Will Be An Emergency Act Soon and They will bring in The Military, If We Don't Comply. Is Moving to Texas a Good option Now?</strong>
    <p><p>Thankfully I'm a USA citizen born in Texas. I had a good planned out future in Canada, prior to this covid and I'm also graduating this year. But, I have accepted the harsh reality that we are screwed. Our degrees, money will not help us in this tyranny so I legit don't care anymore. My mental health is fked and I legit cannot sleep at night since reading this leak and everything is going accordance with it. Which is the even scarier part. https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/leaked-document-canada </p>
<p>So, idgaf anymore. F the future. I just want to live day by day now and I'm seriously planning to move back to Texas. I cannot take this shi anymore. I need people around Me, and I'm a very extroverted and social person and prior to covid, I played ice hockey and was swimming, in the gym always and had so many friends and outdoorsy person. Now, all that is taken away and legit police are fining if you are travelling "non" essentially.</p>
<p>How long till Texas stays free in your guys opinion? I love the true Patriots there, who will fight till their death for freedom. Canadians are too soft and 1 man can't do shi here. But if I go back to My home and atleast My mental health will be good. How long till you think Texas will be free and is moving there a good option now? Regarding living, economy etc. I'm fking serious. Canada is truly fked.</p>
<p>F these tyrants, fascists.</p></p>

        <p>Where I live in NY has not even come close to how bad Canada seems to be. I was told at one point it was essential travel only, but I drove 20 miles to work every day and never saw any cops. Restaurants stayed open for take out food and alcohol. I went to a few group parties with no worries about the rona. The travel ban was done on the honor system and was lifted this month.</p>
<p>But you're right about us all being fucked either way. I'm sure I'll have to quit my job soon. They are pushing vaccines.</p>

        <p>I can't speak about coming into the country, but once you're inside you can go anywhere you want.  I heard something about NYC keeping non-residents out, but don't know for sure, and it's no loss because you'd have to pay me to go to NYC.  Even in blue states, you should be fine.

        <p>A province has to accept/consent to a federal declaration of emergency in Canada tho. Correct me if I'm wrong.
So the NDP and Liberal maneuvering is just posturing in Ontario as far as I can tell. 
As for the leak, just keep on fighting for now. And have contingency plans if need be.</p>
