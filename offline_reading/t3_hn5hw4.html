    <strong>I can not adapt to the mask.</strong>
    <p><p>I just can't adapt. I see everyone walking around in one in 95 degree heat with high humidity like it's nothing, it literally does not bother them. People walking around alone in masks, driving in masks, at the local waterpark when I drove by they were going down the slides in masks, yes people were actually in the water in surgical masks?!?... All my social media is nothing but "oh nurses where them for 12 hours straight, stuck it up and do your part". No one else likes oxygen? No one else sweats under this thing? No one else gets a headache from it? No one else finds it annoying? The majority has nothing but to say about them at all? Everyone else can communicate in it perfectly? I can't understand mumbled mask talk, I have no idea what anyone is saying to me, but no one else apparently has this problem.</p>
<p>Are these people even human? </p>
<p>Sorry today I got mask shamed for removing my mask upon exiting a store and walking through the parking lot. Apparently, walking through a parking lot in extreme heat not near anyone else requires a mask. Even worse, it was by a group of teenagers. Do teenagers rebel these days against anything? They just listen and obey big daddy governement with no questions? All they do these days compete to see who can be the biggest virtue signaler and obey more? Lame. I really thought kids would rebel against this crap, but no they're the ones furthest in. </p>
<p>Over it.</p></p>

        <p>I was at the park for a walk and not wearing a mask. I walk by this old woman and she's on the phone exclaiming to whoever she's talking to that no one is wearing a mask at the park while staring at me. She gives me  a dirty look.</p>
<p>She was not wearing a mask either.</p>
<p>So I stopped and yelled, "Neither are you!" And she turns red and I stand there and stare at her. Then she says "Oh, yes, I am wearing a mask." to whoever she was talking on the phone to.</p>
<p>"NO YOU ARE NOT WEARING A MASK, MA'AM. YOU ARE YELLING ABOUT MASKS AT THE PARK WHILE NOT WEARING ONE! STOP LYING TO WHOEVER YOU ARE ON THE PHONE WITH!"</p>
<p>And she's scurrying into the parking lot shooting me dirty ass looks for tattling on her. "Oh my gosh, I promise you I'm wearing a mask. She's insane. I'm wearing my mask, I promise!"</p>
<p>I'm so fucking over it. Maybe not my finest moment but I'm so fucking sick of it.</p>

        <p>Yep. I had a mask lady giving everyone in our worksite a really hard time about masks. She went up 2 flights of stairs in a mask and got winded and couldn’t catch her breath. She’s holding onto a shelf and rips it off gasping for air. Big ol droplet-spreadin’ gasps. Thankfully I got screen shots from the cctv incase she starts brigading again.</p>

        <p>It's funny now but I was so pissed at the time I was shaking. I got home and told my husband and it wasn't until he started laughing and said, 'Did you really say that?" that I started to see the humor in it.</p>
<p>This is my favorite park and it's become a daily glimpse into insanity. It's unreal.</p>

        <p>Fair enough lol i just hate confrontation. Lemme do my thing, you do you, live and let live, sort of deal. But I get it, people are especially pushy lately, forcing collectivism on everyone, and feeling like they are morally superior because of it. Mind boggling, to say the least. Especially in western civilizations, we are heading toward some trying times. Stay strong dude</p>

You dont need to wear a mask while outdoors in a low-population area not interacting with other people.

        <p>No, doctors and nurses don't wear them their whole shift. Where the hell do they get this bullshit from? Oh yeah...social media, the true plague in society. This whole acceptance of masks and culture of shaming that surrounds their horrendous cult, is not only extremely creepy, and sickening, it is truly the most dystopian shit ever.</p>

        <p>Yeah the healthcare professionals I know say the hours straight thing is generally a complete lie unless you’re in the OR working on a patient. I think many are using their position to shame people and be applauded for it.</p>

        <p>I mean I've never worked in healthcare but I already know that just from being at multiple doctor's office and watching the staff only wear a mask while actively working on a patient. Even a minute break they take it off. They're just making shit up so they can never be wrong.</p>

        <p>I've been asking people this. Why do you think doctors and nurses wear them at all times in the hospital?</p>
<p>And I get, "Hurr durr, haven't you ever been in a hospital stupid?!"</p>
<p>Well yes, I have. I have a lot of health problems. I've been regularly in hospitals my entire life. I have never seen doctors and nurses walking around wearing masks. Have you ever been in a hospital? Then they get really quiet and try to change the subject. Oh, so I'm a dumb fuck who should be ridiculed if you think I'm wrong but when you're wrong we should all quietly move on. Right. Because they can't handle the ridicule they dish out.</p>

        <p>Maybe they get quiet and try to change the subject because they can sense how nuts you are. Since the pandemic hit certainly doctors and nurses in hospitals are wearing masks full time. I've got friends that work in healthcare, they wear them full-time during their shift. Previous to the pandemic you are correct, doctors and nurses did not wear masks full time. Try using that lump of meat between your ears for something other than conspiracy theories 😂</p>

        <p>Nurse here. I have been wearing one, by mandate of my employer, every shift for 6+ hours at a time (I take it off when I go on lunch break), for months. Every nurse I know in the area does the same. We’re not even in a big hotspot area and I’m not even on a COVID-dedicated unit though we see these patients occasionally.</p>

        <p>I meant before this whole covid hysteria. Obviously, they make health care workers, and any kind of worker, wear it their whole shift now. My mom has to wear it 12 hours a day.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't get it either. They feel disgusting, it's hard to breathe &amp; they induce panic. I refuse to use it outside. I have my bandana to get in the store then I pull that shit down. Just seeing everyone else around me with covered faces is terrifying. </p>
<p>It wears on me a lot more than it probably should, but I can't take it anymore. I hope this mandate ends soon. I am sick of being in constant panic when I'm out.</p>

<p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. There likely won't be a vaccine widely available for years. And then it's likely to be a yearly vaccine like for the flu, which will have varying degrees of efficacy every year.  So masks will be in our future for a long, long time.</p>

        <p>I havent worn one since May after I had a ptsd episode that left me shakey for 3 days. I can’t understand how people are adapting to it either. I choose not to. There’s a post recently where someone called it an “indignity” and that really struck a chord with me. Yes, my dignity is more important to me than the lives of people who never did shit for me.

        <p>Shit thank you! I I thought it was just me that really can’t wear one for that reason. </p>
<p>The abuse that happened in my childhood essentially involved covering my face to allow other stuff.</p>
<p>I don’t really know why, because it sounds trivial, but I can’t stand being bought back there. And it happens literally every 15/20mins when I have worn them. </p>
<p>Thing is, I don’t really want to be telling the bus driver, or whatever hysteric random, that I had that happen to me and that it results in an irrationally extreme reaction. </p>
<p>I don’t want to normalise mask wearing because it will inevitably end up involving me having to disclose my reasons to people I’d rather not.</p>

        <p>"You're just selfish."<br>
"You're soooo macho." (sarcasm)<br>
Are comments I have seen online when people say they won't wear them.<br>
Or they belittle them for caring about their own freedoms more than other hypothetical peoples lives.</p>
<p>The thought alone of being mandated to wear them gives me anxiety and gets my heart going. I am man in my late 20s, and the lockdowns, new normal and mask stuff is the only thing that has ever made me feel this way. It's made me so much more aware of how friends who suffered with anxiety felt before this all started. And it's made it clear to me who really cares about others and who only pretends to for social points.</p>

        <p>This is what I've been experiencing when thinking about friends with anxiety too. I've never felt such heightened emotions until I started having to worry about my freedom when leaving the house and constantly worrying about getting attacked for not wearing a muzzle. I don't want to say I suddenly have an issue with anxiety, but it may be true that as of the past few months I'm really struggling to be optimistic about life. Though, as you said, everyone is only "pretending" to care… so my worries are quite valid.</p>

        <p>It was my mother who told me I need to calm down, and pointed out that "you don't want to have a heart attack", while on the phone one afternoon, not in a condescending way, as she agrees that some people's behaviour is insane. And my girlfriend (whom it has been impossible for me to see due to the country she is in having closed their borders), who told me it's a waste of time to argue with some people because they are essentially ideologues. There minds are made up and closed.</p>
<p>What might give you some hope; last night I saw a MSM article in the UK about the potential of introducing mandatory masks with so many comments from the public saying "no", "won't wear it" that it dwarfed any others. They were the most numerous and most upvoted.</p>

        <p>I've had many weeks where I have felt physically nauseated because of this. I do think it's been a real issue for me to deal with physical issues as a result of the stress this has caused. So your mom is right as my mom has also tried to calm me down as well. My mom actually got me a face shield and I can't imagine life without it. I wear it when I go places that I just want to go to the store and have actually started receiving complements because of it and being able to see my entire face!</p>
<p>While I do slightly rebel at places like the post office or restaurants I've gotten takeout from, there's no way I can go on worrying about this day and night perpetually. I think there has become a noticeable issue where governments are trying to "mandate" the muzzle. And there's people who support that! I'm ok with a business saying whatever rules they want to have… but I saw elsewhere that does that mean it's ok for a business to refuse service for other "reasons?" I sure hope it doesn't get to the point where this is global law.</p>

        <p>I am tempted to buy one of those, but currently it isn't required to wear a mask in England except on public transport. In Scotland they are brining it in as a requirement in stores on Friday.<br>
I have high hope they won't do that here as most people I see don't wear them! In fact the only people in stores I have seen wearing masks have been in larger DIY stores and Costco. Something I find amusing because these stores are orders of magnitudes larger than my local shop, so keeping distance is easy.</p>

        <p>I love seeing that there's places that don't require wearing something. But for now, I at least take comfort in wearing the shield as it feels like it would be more effective; say someone isn't wearing a mask and they spit when talking—my shield will stop it from going anywhere near my face entirely! I do think that this needs to end at some point. And I believe the next "fad" for the world to fixate on will come in a matter of time.</p>

        <p>Face shields must be better than masks for that reason alone, yet why aren't they being insisted upon over masks. </p>
<p>Anecdotally, I visited a hospital during the midst of the lockdown in the UK and the doctor who saw me wore a face shield and no mask, it was quite nice talking to him actually as I could see his face and see he understood my pain.</p>

        <p>That's so great that a doctor was wearing one and not a mask! I'm still shocked that everyone thinks it's muzzles only.</p>
<p>As it's been said on these haven subs, I think it's the symbolism that comes with a mask that makes them prevalent. Companies use them as an excuse to say "look what we're doing. Despite being only in it for profits before, now we suddenly care about your health!" But I believe it's just like other "initiatives" that companies do and is for PR and image. People can't "socially distance." It's p h y s i c a l distancing. But companies buy into the buzzwords for the sake of "look at me!"-ing.</p>
<p>You could even see this year the two things that companies are getting at are the diversity and safety… I believe the diversity needs to continue to happen. But not this faux-hospital experience of going out in public because "the government said so" and it's trendy to say they care.</p>

<p>I gave this sub a chance. I wanted to try and understand where you may be coming from. </p>
<p>But this statement is so laden with selfishness, I’m in awe. Not caring about others dying, for the sake of preserving your own supposed dignity- which <em>wearing a piece of cloth</em> trespasses, apparently? </p>
<p>Dear god. I wish all of you the best. I hope there comes a moment where you realize there are real human beings in danger, every person you walk past, that you could help and protect, as well as yourself. That indeed, not everything is a conspiracy. Sometimes, the right thing to do is simply the one everyone is doing. </p>

<p>Dear God, with a capital G, how do you get through life like this? Seeing every person as a disease threat? As someone in danger? As someone to “protect” whether they asked for it or not? I’ll tell you right now the gran generation is actually the most fed up with restrictions, many don’t follow the “new normal” rules, and they never asked for it nor wanted it.</p>
<p>That’s actually a form of abuse when you do something for someone they never asked for and then get upset at them and call them “selfish” for not “appreciating” it.</p>
<p>Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.</p>

        <p>I don't wear one unless a business requires it.    My masks are homemade malicious compliance masks, which are very flimsy, and don't block my breathing at all.   </p>
<p>I will note that I am scrupulous in the shop or doing yard work about wearing an actual effective respirator (if fumes are involved) or an N95 (for dust).   I also wore a mask for a couple of weeks in previous years while outdoors here when the wildfire smoke was really bad.    Meaning, I don't have a problem with masks, I have a problem with pointless masks merely to demonstrate compliance.</p>

        <p>It's funny when you realize that it's all really smoke and mirrors. Nobody really cares whether you are wearing that actually makes a difference. It's just about doing what your told and whether you're "one of us." Recently a guy at the supermarket checkout had some tee shirt loosely wrapped around his face. Nobody minded as long as he had something covering his face and looked ridiculous.</p>

        <p>I live in CA - mandatory mask wearing. For shopping, I wear a buff. I put it around my neck then pull it up over my nose. I can breathe a lot better. I have to wear a N95 at work and I find myself getting super hot and sweating from breathing in my own hot air. I have to wear it when I am facing the public. As soon as I get into my vehicle, it comes off and I take a few seconds to breathe deeply.</p>

        <p>Walking through a store full of mask wearers is like being in a herd of robotic zombies. I see lots of people taking them off or pulling down to their chin once they're outside. I can barely make it through 30 minutes inside a store, it's so hard to breath. To hell with anyone who thinks I should wear one outside.</p>

<p>Reading this thread is disheartening. People have no idea what the purpose of the masks even is. Furthermore, nobody is mandating they be worn outside - if people want to, that’s fine though. Why should it bother anyone. Transmission by air outside is not a major issue. Indoors is a whole other thing.</p>

        <p>I read a number of these orders, and they’re specific to situations outside where you cannot maintain social distance. There may be a couple exceptions of cities or counties that just say “everywhere outside”, but it nowhere near every major city. </p>
<p>My state has mandated masks for a few weeks, thankfully. But it’s not mandated outside. Just if you’re interacting with people, or at a place of business indoors.</p>

        <p>You are right to be worried about the young generations being overly preoccupied with safety and virtue-signalling. Leaving aside the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hhxyto/whats_the_best_fake_fact_you_can_think_of/fwdznh2/">ineffectiveness</a> of cloth masks, their being made mandatory sets a precedent that is dangerous both legally (your health becomes my responsibility; personal health becomes an obligation of sorts) and in terms of setting a new normal. The fact that pro-maskers are now saying - while thinking it is very clever and effective - "<strong>when you go out, you cover your genitals; in the same way, cover your face</strong>" is indicative of this danger of normalization. There are more than 200 respiratory viruses; every few years some of them are more aggressive than usual - if masks become normalized, of course the nanny state at the bequest of an increasingly (and sadly) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaCoronavirus/comments/hm4fan/theatre_star_nick_cordero_dies_at_41_following/fx3msw5/">risk-averse</a> population would periodically mandate them. I can easily foresee year 2040 when the new generations will look in horror to earlier generations for daring to go out in public without a mask. Just as today some of us are outraged at widespread tobacco use or drunk driving in the 1960s. Luckily I'm old enough that by 2040 there's a fair chance I will be dead. That's not the world I want to live in.</p>

        <p>I mean, people are wearing masks exactly <em>because</em> they are genuinely scared for their lives, their loved ones lives, and I'd like to think the lives of their fellow human beings. So by your logic it's perfectly fine to pull a gun on someone for <em>not</em> wearing a mask as well?</p>
<p>Listen I'm in the UK, we're not required to wear masks in public - currently we're only required to wear them to a hospital or on public transport, and even then there are exceptions to the rule. It's also not up to the bus driver for instance to enforce the ruling. But the majority of people wear them. Because we don't want to get sick. And we don't want others to get sick. We're also advised to wear them in crowded public places, though not everyone does. However I've seen more and more people choosing to do so. It's really not that big of a deal, and it's certainly not political because fuck the Tories.</p>
<p>But I'll tell you what, if our government made it law to wear a face <em>covering</em> in a public setting, you can be sure as shit that the majority of us would do it because we actually understand the severity of the situation we face, <em>globally</em>, as a species. The fact is, the US government has handled this pandemic with such ineptitude that it allowed states to end lockdowns far too soon, and wasn't strict enough in enforcing lockdowns to begin with. Wearing a face covering has become a political issue, which is completely and utterly absurd. You now have 3 million confirmed cases and counting, and don't look like you're getting the virus under control any time soon. It's lamentable. How many people have to die before you start taking it seriously?</p>

        <p>If people are scared of people not wearing masks, they're cowardly wimps, plain and simple. If those same people are threatening to assault you, you have every right to defend yourself, that includes a gun. You're in the UK so I can see why you'd be against that.</p>
<p>Nobody is capable of getting the virus under control. Viruses gonna virus. You can lockdown all you want but once you open, it's all for naught. Might as well live with it because you can't eliminate it.</p>

        <p>Tell that to New Zealand and the various other countries around the world who have some semblance of control over the virus, and whose daily new case count is in the single digits because they listened to the advice of medical experts and the people elected to run their country. Your government has zero control, it's embarrassing. I actually feel sorry for you as a nation having such incompetent leadership. Not that ours is much better, mind.</p>
<p>Might as well live with it... well ok you guys in America can live with it if you like, everyone else in the world will do our best to stop it spreading and save hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives. Except Brazil apparently, who just so happen to have an exceptionally incompetent leader in Bolsonaro.</p>

America will have travel restrictions imposed on it until your government can show it can get a handle on the situation.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best.</p>

        <p>Of course they're uncomfortable, but so were the corsets of the Victorian era and skinny jeans of the 70's. People do it to fit in; the virus is just an excuse to shame non-conformity.</p>

        <p>I'm with you. I do not get how people are perfectly fine wearing masks outside in the heat. A girl I knew from high school posted pictures of her family at an amusement park and they were happily walking around in their masks in the 90 degree weather. I don't get it. Do they not sweat? Does it not itch? And what about the tan line they will get?? I refuse to wear a mask outside. The other day, my mom and I were waiting outside to get into my toddler's gym class and my mom put her mask on. I was like, "mom, we are outside and no one else is around; seriously? Are you that brain washed?" And my mom was anti-mask. It drives me nuts that people are okay with this.</p>
<p>And nurses are not wearing masks for 12 hours straight OUTSIDE. I can maayyybbee get behind wearing masks inside for short periods of time. But outside and for 5, 6, 7, 8 hours a day? No. </p>
<p>Unfortunately the mask nuts are just picking up more and more steam. I am losing hope that this will all be over soon.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. I hate wearing masks, but can't rant about it anywhere but here. Everyone seems so condescending about it, like, "Aww, selfish whiney baby can't handle a little cloth over your face for 30 minutes at the grocery store?"</p>
<p>I work in a building without AC in the south in summer. Having a "little cloth" stuck to my face for a 7 or 8 hour shift is so uncomfortable that it interferes with my ability to do my job. I spend the day nauseous and panicky because breathing through fabric triggers claustrophobic anxiety. (Stemming from childhood trauma of being locked in a toy box and shoved in a closet at daycare? Who knows.)</p>
<p>Masks cause painful breakouts all over my chin and cheeks (I've tried a few different materials with the same results), and since I work in the heat, I'm constantly touching my face to wipe away sweat. Aren't the masks supposed to make us touch our faces LESS? </p>
<p>Today was my first day working with a plastic face shield and it was significantly more comfortable, even if the headband was still kinda itchy. At least it was easy to breathe. I'd give that a try for places where face coverings are required.</p>

        <p>I’m a teenager and a large part of my friend group are mask nazis unfortunately. The rest of us have started hanging out with those guys less and less. Today’s teenagers believe everything on social media like boomers believe everything on MSM. Also many of today’s teenagers have overprotective parents and think it’s normal. I should know, I’m one of them. Trust me, the teenage mask nazis are just virtue signaling. They think they’re heroes when in reality they’re villains.</p>

        <p>They are wearing masks while on water slides? Holy hell. At least they are trying to enjoy their summer, I guess, but that is absolutely ridiculous. I love water slides, and go to water parks almost every week during the summer, but water slides either </p>
<p>a) dunk me into a pool, or 
b) if they’re tall and fast enough, leave me with the mother of all wedgies. </p>
<p>I feel like either of these situations would lead to you either choking on your mask or waterboarding yourself. </p>
<p>I wear a mask to the amusement park (mandated in queues) but I can usually gauge whether or not the particular employees in the area care. If I get the vibe that they don’t, I take it off. Otherwise, I ear-dangle for as long as I can, until I get close to an employee. Then I pull it up. I take it off once I get into the ride itself. And I don’t go to the park for longer than a few hours now because it’s just too much with the stupid mask. It gives me headaches, although my new one is a bit more breathable than the surgical kind so it’s better than nothing. </p>
<p>I saw some post elsewhere on Reddit where someone was legitimately saying that they wished the United States would be more collectivist and group-oriented like India, and that individuality is going to ruin us all, or something stupid like that. And then tied it to people not wearing masks. These are the people we are dealing with. Personally, I’m not compromising my individuality for anything. I’m ME, an individual. I’m unapologetic about what I love and hate, I live my life the way I want to, and I do whatever I want, whenever I want to do it. I don’t care about these people’s collectivist wet dream. If I don’t want to wear a mask, I shouldn’t have to do it. No reasons needed beyond “I don’t want to wear one”. I’ve never cared about fitting in. I have some pretty esoteric hobbies/fandoms, listen to gangster rap and extreme metal, do solo travel, and watch children’s cartoons on the regular. I. Do. <em>Not.</em> Care. I think that’s one thing that has frustrated me so much about the situation starting in March — suddenly, a whole bunch of people decided that they were going to start controlling my life. Because <em>they</em> somehow knew what was best for me, not me. Apparently.</p>

I only wear it in businesses so people don’t like at me funny but I usually remove it as soon as I get outside and I don’t wear it at the park.

People have tried to talk to me on many occasions like there’s not anything on their face and I literally just nod.

        <p>Ive been debating getting rid of my facebook for awhile. All it is anymore is shaming everyone over masks and calling everything and everyone racist.
Oh god and the anti firework rants over the holiday were really the cherry on top. 
Its like, dont tell people to "stay the fuck home" and then post a selfie of you out and about in your freakshow mask, thinking "its okay im wearing a mask" -no its not okay, if some of these people really wanted to "help the greater good" then there are a million and one things better to be benefical than wearing a rag over your mouth.</p>

        <p>And that my friend, is the issue with virtue signaling that is rampantly spread all throughout social media and the news media.</p>
<p>“Wear your mask, lower your chances of infecting others, save lives”</p>
<p>Of course everyone wants to jump on that bandwagon, everyone wants to feel like a hero when they’re only adding to the hysteria. </p>
<p>I never understood the concept from the beginning, I somewhat understand considering the virus has a long incubation period, I was exposed and didn’t show symptoms for 7 days. But the negatives of a mask far outweigh the benefits, the only use I see for it is if you are COVID positive and need to protect others. But I don’t see why the general populace mandates it.</p>
<p>Also the argument that nurses and doctors wear it their whole shift, they don’t. They dispose of them usually after surgery, or periodically through the day, say when they go on lunch or take a break. Also mind you they are in air conditioned hospitals. </p>
<p>The mask can have uses, but this pandemic shows me how a piece of cloth can be used to stroke people’s egos and propel a generation of hysteria.</p>

<p>You answered your own question. You are still infectious without symptoms, but you don't know that you are. When you have symptoms you stay home of course. </p>
<p>Masks are also supposed to be temporary, if the numbers get to a stable low digit you can phase out masks in public because the amount of infectious people at any moment is low enough. But of course if you refuse to do anything to lower the numbers expect that this drags out for a long time. In countries that did their best, masks are not necessary in public, only in public transport.</p>
<p>It amazes me how people can be so patriotic yet so unwilling to give up anything for their fellow countrymen.</p>

        <p>When I see someone out with a mask all I can think about is how they are smearing their face with accumulated spit and finely aged snot, because you know those things are generally worn in contact with people's nose and mouth.   Capital-G Gross.</p>
<p>Unlike respirators that you wear when you're painting, or N95 fiber masks, both of which are designed to stay clear of your nose and mouth.   They're uncomfortable too but they're not stupid for wearing during physical tasks.</p>

        <p>When I was hiking last weekend, an old lady approached from the opposite direction with her mask under her chin, before we passed, she pulled her mask over her mouth and nose, took two giant steps off the trail away from me, and turned her back to me as I walked by. Such paranoia.</p>

        <p>This happened to me yesterday. I was sitting on a bench by the water and this rather fit, healthy young girl was walking without a mask, but had to put it on to pass me and stepped off the sidewalk to avoid me and then took the mask off again once she passed... So paranoid.</p>

        <p>They are just NPCs.  Ignore them, don't wear the mask, be the change you want to see.  It's really weird sometimes being the only one not wearing one in a train carriage in the UK, but so far only a handful of people have tried to say anything and I just told them 'It's dangerous for me to wear a mask' - which is true.  Does give you a constant feeling of paranoia someone is going to try and start something though, I absolutely understand why so many people are giving in to the pressure.</p>

        <p>I find it so much easier to breathe in a proper n95 or p95 than those cloth and surgeon masks. The cloth ones tend to not exhaust very well. Maybe try wearing it a bit tighter so you end up pushing air though it instead of beneath it?</p>

        <p>\&rt;No one else likes oxygen?</p>
<p>I sure do, hard to enjoy it with permanent lung damage from a preventable disease though.</p>
<p>\&rt;No one else sweats under this thing?</p>
<p>If it's 95 out and you're not sweating already, the mask shouldn't make a difference.</p>
<p>\&rt;No one  else gets a headache from it? </p>
<p>No? If you are you might be wearing it wrong or have a breathing issue already, you should be extra careful since those who die have preexisting conditions.</p>
<p>\&rt;No one else finds it annoying?</p>
<p>Of course, but you know what's more annoying? People who can't find the grain of extra effort in them to give a single fuck about the people around them, who matter just as much as yo who expects everyone else to care about your grievances. If you don't like it, go live in the woods by yourself and don't take part in this society that requires a bit of cooperation and empathy.</p>
<p>\&rt;Do teenagers rebel these days against anything?</p>
<p>Yeah, things that they can't control like police brutality and political corruption and greed. Things that matter most, things like people who deny science and promote opinion based realities. What did you rebel against?</p>
<p>\&rt;They just listen and obey big daddy governement with no questions?</p>
<p>Big daddy government is actually on your side on this</p>

        <p>&rt;No one else likes oxygen? </p>
<p>Obviously silly question, but we do.</p>
<p>&rt;No one else sweats under this thing</p>
<p>We do. It's okay to sweat.</p>
<p>&rt;No one else gets a headache from it?</p>
<p>We do. It's okay to have a headache. I'm sure it's not the worst thing life has thrown your way.</p>
<p>&rt;No one else finds it annoying?</p>
<p>We do. Double pneumonia followed by death or permanent damage is also very annoying.</p>
<p>&rt;The majority has nothing to say about them at all?</p>
<p>Because there's nothing to be said. Yes, wearing a mask is more annoying than not wearing a mask. Put your fucking mask on before you get others sick, and deal with the annoyance.</p>
<p>&rt;Everyone else can communicate in it perfectly?</p>
<p>No. We have to raise our voices to be heard, and it's tough to hear others.</p>
<p>&rt;Are these people even human?</p>
<p>What do you mean by this?</p>
<p>Walking through a parking lot without a mask is fine if you're not near anyone. The people that shamed you were stupid. So is not wearing your mask when you should be.</p>
<p>This is not something people should be "rebelling against". It's literally to keep us all from catching the virus that is in every country besides a few right now.</p>
<p>All of this is common sense.</p>

        <p>Get a better mask. I have a terry cotton mask made by Los Angeles Apparel and they’re far more comfortable than the polypropylene surgical N95. The cotton also absorbs moisture.</p>
