    <strong>The descent into scientism and worship of orthodoxy has culminated in this disaster...</strong>
    <p><p>Let me be clear, there is nothing wrong with science itself. Science is merely a method of modelling reality for description and prediction. The misconception pervading society is that products, policies and instructions that involve science in their creation are "science". That medical mandates inherently carry the epistemological authority of science and thus are above questioning by any lay person.</p>
<p>This is all wrong. Society is not a science experiment and our government, when creating policy, is not doing science. The "do not question policy because science" tactic is a trick of rhetoric, a manipulation of the reverence people hold for lab coats and charts. Ironically, attitudes like this are logically fallacious and antithetical to academic thinking. Or at least the history of academic thought - things have been changing.</p>
<p>At the core of this entire covid controversy is an <strong>opinion based</strong> divide regarding how we should handle risk. There is no quantity of acceptable or unacceptable risk embedded in the universe. No "correct" policy one unlocks with sufficient knowledge of epidemiology. </p>
<p>One's risk intolerance is not necessarily more important than another's risk tolerance. Vice versa. If that were the standard, then anyone who found a non-zero risk of viral infection unacceptable could demand society lockdown indefinitely. How often have you seen the argument "even one death is unacceptable!". Such a standard would permanently end the physically interactive world. Even if covid were eradicated there is potential for viral infection at any moment all over the planet. </p>
<p>Science is not concerned with delineating the "correct" position on a spectrum of risk assessment. Science isn't concerned with prescribing policy. It certainly doesn't care about politics or "left vs. right". What we do about covid is a human question. It's personal. Anyone purporting that science solved the risk assessment problem doesn't understand what science is, at best. And at worst they are feeding into rhetoric manipulation to serve their own agenda.</p></p>

<p>There. You hit the nail right on the head. Carl Sagan once said:</p>
<p><em>Arguments from authority carry little weight — “authorities” have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.</em></p>
<p>The problem is that many people, especially politicians and the media, almost treat science like it's infallible. It isn't and to treat it as such is an abuse of science.</p>

        <p>I've been really wanting to do a rant about this constant lazy "science" excuse for awhile now. You've done a great job at pointing everything out. What they are calling "science" is nothing but scientific consensus. But it's not even that, because there are tons of doctors, scientists, etc who are not agreeing with their bullshit. But they are being threatened, attempted to be discredited, and censored. So the "authoritative sources" that agree with the mainstream narrative are the ones that get the contracts, the articles, the exposure.</p>
