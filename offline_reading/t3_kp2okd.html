        <p>Well you see, in some flu seasons the flu is a Rhinovirus, in other flu seasons it is a Coronavirus, just because viruses are from the same family has no bearing on how they act. Covid-19 does not act as the common flu, it is more deadly, transmits more easily, and is not seasonal. The flu is a seasonal virus and as you can see by our spikes of cases in the summer, Covid-19 is not seasonal. Besides that, we have good vaccines for the flu most seasons because we have ways to predict the upcoming flu virus by looking at animal and human populations. In conclusion, unlike flu Rhinoviruses and Coronaviruses, Covid-19 is more deadly, not seasonal, more contagious, and we didn't have a vaccine for it until recently. Please try your best to limit the spread of the virus, considering we have a vaccine around the corner and the cases in the US are at an all-time high, hopefully by 2022 we can go back to normal, maybe by the summer you will start to see that shift.</p>

        <p>Do not conflate flu with cold. The "common cold" is one of many mostly harmless viruses, including some coronaviruses and rihnoviruses. Influenza (flu) is a type of virus in and of itself, and the infectiousness and lethality. This includes the 1918 h1n1 that killed millions</p>

        <p>You are correct the Rhinovirus is a cold virus. Sadly, every point besides the vaccine still applies. The common cold is also less deadly than the flu, meaning it is FAR LESS DEADLIER than Covid-19.</p>

        <p>Covid is fairly seasonal. We were just hit by it in the spring, so that's when we had a big wave, but cases went way down in summer. It is a respitory virus, which transmits more in winter. Covid is from a family of common cold viruses, and is more severe, but not what I'd call deadly. It has a survival rate of 99.7% for under 50's, 99.5% for under 70's and 95% for over 70's. It's really not a death sentence, and is a lot like flu. It transmits the same way, causes similar symptoms, is prevelent in colder months and has a wide range of cases from mild to severe, with a low death rate which targets the same group of at risk people (except flu targets children too) and generally kills by aggravating existing conditions. Everyone's been trying for months but it's not working. Lockdowns are hurting so so many people, can they hold out until 2022? Also, with vaccine rollouts happening now, why on earth should it last past vaccinating the at risk population? Why would that take until 2022? Also, rhinovirus does not cause the flu. Influenza does.</p>

        <p>It's not just 80 somethings that are dying from covid-19, while they are more likely to die from it by a lot the chances of a 40 dying from covid vs the flu is still way higher. We have yet to vaccinate those at risk and it is NOT THE SAME AS THE FLU. This is worse than even some of the worst flus. And how is covid seasonal??? while it is worse in the winter it still obviously has the ability to spread in the summer as you can see by cases in Florida and other places. The only real reason this is happening as well is that people are indoors. The flu cannot survive in the heat while covid-19 obviously can making Covid not very seasonal.</p>

        <p>Covid is seasonal. It is a well known fact that respitory viruses spread more easily in colder months. We were hit with the first wave in spring. No one had any immunity, so there were a lot of cases and more deaths. It calmed down in the summer as the wave subsided, and went back up as it got colder because it is indeed seasonal. Respitory viruses can spread in warmer months but do not do so significantly. Covid did because the population hadn't been exposed to it before, so it spread very easily. Covid isn't the flu, no, but it is similar. In symptoms, the way it spreads, but also in how the cases vary in severity hugely, and how both attack people who are already at risk. The flu also targets children while covid does not, I will note. The chances of a forty year old dying are on average about 0.3%. That's really not very significant. The average age of death from covid-19 is 80, with the average death rate for over 70's being 5%. That is more significant, but it's only concentrated in a small part of the population who are more at risk in general. Also worth noting that an estimated 94% of recorded deaths are in people with an average of 2.9 comorbidities, over 90% of those deaths being within the elderly. So are they dying of covid or with it? Considering we record a covid death as a death within 28 days of a positive test, I have my suspicions.</p>

<p>Stop making stupid ass excuses not to listen to the scientists. Covid is now the number one killer of humans in the US. More than car crashes, more than cancer, more than heart disease. And it’s only getting exponentially worse because people like you can’t just listen to people who know more than you do.</p>

        <p>What about flu? Pneumonia isn't as big a killer, flu would be a better comparison. Covid is not the number one killer. This is because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Previously pneumonia and influenza were recorded together as p/i, but not they are recorded along with covid-19 as PIC. So, these deaths are being conflated. We haven't just magicked away the flu this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covid deaths were not reset. Every year, deaths are reset. For flu we see this as they're reset at the beginning of every flu season. Considering the many similarities with the flu in how it spreads, symptoms, wide range of cases, targets at risk populations (except flu also targets children), low death rate etc etc, why is covid not being recorded in that way? Why are they being recorded cumulatively? Why were they not reset at the start of flu season? Or at the start of the year? Will they be reset in March?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A covid death is a death within 28 days of a positive test. Simple as that. There's no verification as to whether or not that person actually died of covid or simply died with it. And if they died having had it 27 days ago, they didn't even die with it. Past that, in some places it goes on a death certificate because of suspicion, without even the proof of a test. As a result, deaths of things like heart disease are down because the victims of this were recorded as a covid death. Because of all of this, the CDC themselves estimate that only 6% of recorded covid-19 deaths were actually caused by the virus.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And also note that for a young healthy person like me, my chance of dying from covid is 1 in 19.1 million. From a car crash, it's 1 in 114 (Last time I checked anyway). I have a greater chance of drowning than dying from covid. Just thought I'd put that out there.</p>
