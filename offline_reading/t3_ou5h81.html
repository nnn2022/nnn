    <strong>"F***ING DONE" ROLE CALL</strong>
    <p><p>Who else is done with this shit??  They went too far a long time ago and they just keep taking inches and inches. The people running the show are destroying our lives, brainwashing our society, and stealing our opportunities and liberty out from underneath our feet. No fuck that, not moving another inch AND I WANT MY HUMAN RIGHTS BACK YOU FUCKS, I am not complying anymore regardless of the price, you're gonna have to kill me. Not playing these games and I don't give a fuck how you paint me in the media because anyone that watches and believes that circus, is wearing clown shoes. We have you figured out and those who have contributed to this sham are guilty of crimes against humanity and after we gain enough traction WE WILL HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE AND JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED.  The cracks are beginning to show and they fucking know it. They hold the "power" so if they go down they will probably take the economy down with them, but we are not pampered rich scum so we will work together and we will be fine. Karma is a bitch when you got it coming. Who else feels the same? I know you do so you might as well draw the line in the sand right here right now if you haven't already. Keep making noise.</p></p>

        <p>My wife and I are prepared to die on this hill. If we're fired for refusing the experimental jab, attacked for not wearing masks, thrown in jail for trying to buy food like normal people, so be it. Anyone who denies an individual's natural right to medical sovereignty and bodily autonomy is on the wrong side of history.</p>

        <p>Because we we're given guidelines for preserving liberty by our founding father's. The government never should have got this big and we should have never let the elite buy our politicians.  I understand there isn't a whole lot they could have done, thats why I said I don't blame them. We traded self sustainability for corporations and convenience. Instead of working together to run our communities we now just hand over 30% of our paycheck and let the government do it for us. To reverse these things is a very difficult task. We let them have too much power and now look. They own everything.</p>

<p>I'd recommend, to anyone reading, that if you want a better handle on what subversion is watch some talks by KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov. He warned us.</p>
<p>https://www.bi tc hute.com/video/uGBwXQZDrFx3/</p>
<p>(Remove spaces because Chicom Reddit deletes comments with links to that site.)</p>
<p>One big aspect of subversion is the promotion of ingratitude and resentment. It stunts your growth as a human being. You are led to discount the hard work and wisdom of your unsubverted peers in the present, and your ancestors in the past, and to expect that things you haven't earned should rightfully be given to you.</p>
<p>I personally bought into subversion when I was young and it led me to squander my potential in a lot of ways. It's akin to being under a spell except that when the spell is broken things don't immediately change... it can take years.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how far this shit's going to go but when they come for your bodily autonomy - with the same aggressiveness and rhetoric that they use to start wars - there's really no alternative but to resist. The superclass really need to be put in their place once and for all otherwise they are going to keep trying even if they lose this time.</p>

        <p>Same. We're so comfortable nobody wants to step out of line and lose that comfort.  Well I don't care because this isn't about me being comfortable, it's about the world we're handing to our children. If we don't act because we we're too comfortable then our decendents will suffer and they will be enslaved and they will have no way out. It's not happening, not without a fight.</p>

        <p>We can only blame ourselves for allowing "them" to become this powerful. Our forefathers would be ashamed. Our government has went unchecked for longer then we have been alive. We have become silent because when they flex because we are afraid to lose our jobs, lose our friends, social status, family or be labeled as something! Their plan has worked almost flawlessly (divide and conquer) and brainwashing enough weak minded individuals into believing all of the above mentioned if you question or oppose our "rulers". Simple fact is this imho, no elected official is gonna "save US" from the powers that be and yes, NOT EVEN TRUMP can save US! It is up to US, WE THE PEOPLE and US alone! We have the power, we work in the factories, sawmills, construction sites, grocery stores, restaurants, hospitals, drive the trucks, deliver the food, fly the planes, work the mines, work on the shipping barges etc... We together could shut the world completely down in the matter of minutes and remind these fucks that THEY are employees, not rulers! This could be achieved but it would take US having true unity and working together to help one another FREE OF CHARGE because money and power is their only language they understand. Hit them where it hurts, their pockets and their power and in my opinion this will restore order within our government (s)! Just my opinion. POWER BACK TO THE PEOPLE!✊🏽✊🏻✊🏾✊🏿✊🏼✊🇺🇲</p>

        <p>Considering how many men have died for liberty,  this is absolutely blasphemous. And yes they are terrified of us. They know the people have the true power. Thats why they spend so much energy on dumbing us down, making us feel small, much us feel powerless, innoculating us with fear. Unfortunately for them they do not understand evolution.  The greater the adversity the greater the adaptation. We will become smarter and stronger people by the end of this. Oh but hey not sure if you know what the fist of solidarity is but its usually associated with communism lol. The intent of it is good though.</p>

        <p>Alright- But theres aslo strength in numbers. Right now were a minority almost everywhere. But where nownis the largest amount of people who think like us? Ive long heard stories of Idaho and Montana as beiny the big off the grid areas.</p>
<p>What Im worried about is he w we can organize without the feds infiltrating. That happens to every rebel group, and especially now that were commjnicating on the internet, its even harder. I mean this whole conversation is being monitored so Im not gonna say anything specific like “Lets meet on 12 Thomas street at 3:20 on Tuesday! But we do need to figure out how to do this. Get large enough to basically be our own small country</p>

        <p>We need to be a little more intelligent than “Storm the capitol”. I hate to admit it, but enough militsry will stop us. I think we need to take a more defensive approach-like a general strike, creating our own currencies... and of course being armed when they try to shut us down.</p>

        <p>Well. I like all those things you said, we just need to take it a step further.</p>
<p>Instead of boycotting a particular company (Theres like ten companies tht run the food industry thats it) we have to start creating local enonomies independent of the world economy, world bank, and US dollar.</p>
<p>Instead of just storming a statehouse, EXACTLY how we play into the MSMs narrative that were thugs, assuring no kne else will join us, our communitites are well foritified and DEFENDED, but we dont attack. Take a page out of the Massachuetts town militias in Lexinton and Concord, and the Black Panthers in the 1960- Dont fire unless fired upon.</p>
<p>Instead of just holding big protests, so common at this point theyve lost their meaning, we organize more en masse divestments from the economy and just obedience pf US laws</p>

<p>Edit:</p>
<p>They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. <strong>There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong lone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.</strong> Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable--and let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come.</p>
<p>It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace-- but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!</p>

        <p>I've been done since March, when I told everyone that would listen that this was obvious bullshit psychological warfare.  I still remember the news reports showing people dropping dead on the streets of China.  Still haven't worn a mask and still haven't changed anything except which stores I shop in.  The handful of mask lunatic stores in this area still won't get any dollars from me.  They are not forgiven.  I won't fight stores that mandate masks.  I walk in, politely refuse and keep walking, and if they persist (and few do), I take my business to a place that likes humans.</p>
<p>There were times this spring when even some of the more strong-willed folks I know cowed, and I felt very alone in my stubborn refusal to comply. That was not discouraging however, it just hardened my resolve that I would never participate in normalizing this psychotic game of human face shaming and endlessly contradictory, illogical, pretentious, arbitrary rule changing.  I smiled at browbeaten unpersons, dutifully acquiescing to commands from pimpley teens guarding entrances.  My face is normal and good and your magic porous aerosol and fluid dynamics ignoring face rag is insane.  I do not wish to become a Star Belly Sneetch.</p>
<p>I stopped even wondering what others thought of me, and I realized that even if some folks were mad, only a small number were scared of me and that is on them.  Most folks who were cursing me in their angry minds were angry because I wasn't following the rules.  They are angry that I was uncompliant, or they assumed I belonged to a different political party than they did.  That realization led me to completely forget that I was unmasked.  It eventually stopped even crossing my mind when I parked.</p>
<p>Stop complying.  Don't get exemptions.  Don't make excuses.  Don't try to convince people that physics is still a thing after 2020.  Don't try to red-pill them (unless they are already just about there), if this isn't obvious to them by now they are lost in TV corporate/gov media land, and they will choose when it is time to accept the evidence of their eyes and ears, or they will cheer on the crackdown and wish you harm.  Just politely refuse to comply.  Reject the social pressure in your mind.  It's not your business what others think of you.  Realize that the negative emotions produced from being "other" are created by a system of manufactured mass insanity.  Fear and moral superiority are the most dangerous emotions.  This experiment and the obvious goals can only be reached if people comply.  Make non-compliance normal.</p>

        <p>God forbid we should ever be 20. years without such a rebellion.1 The people can not be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. We have had 13. states independant 11. years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half for each state. What country before ever existed a century and half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it’s liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it’s natural manure. ~Thomas Jefferson</p>

        <p>We all agree. NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA MOTHERFUCKING DO ABOUT IT?!</p>
<p>This isnt going to end with somewhat unfair and discriminatory laws. This is chemical warfare and will soon lead to fascism. We cant keep acting like refusing to wear masks in a grocery store and obviously not getting vaccinated is enough- Not that you shouldnt feel proud youve stood against the propaganda wave thusfar- you should be. But this is Germany in 1934. No one could have seen the holocaust coming then.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the media is not going to stop. Just this week we got a lot more mandatory vaccine propaganda, delta variant fearmongering, and the CDC announcement. I've had to cut a few people off since they support the segregation and mandatory vaccine agenda. Honestly, anyone who supports those things can go fuck themselves. Maybe they will turn around in the future but who knows, I cannot trust these people. It's really disappointing.</p>
<p>At this point, I'm just prepping for whatever is going to happen later this year or next year.</p>

        <p>There is no law that says we have to lockdown or wear a mask or get a vaccine. And if there were, Marbury v. Madison clearly established that "any law that is repugnant to the Constitution is void." I'm with OP, they can go fuck themselves with their mandates and orders.</p>

        <p>Ive been saying this for months-we need to start working toward self sustaining communities of people all like us. The problem is most of us are so far from being self-sustaining that we need to get on it NOW before these restrictions get worse.  If were having this conversation a year from now, it be too late.</p>

        <p>I’m almost laughing but not really. This doesn’t even seem like real life. It’s like that episode of South Park where the boys go to that old western town and they can’t break character but the whole time they’re just trying to get the actors to admit they’re acting. Idk I’m stoned.</p>

        <p>it's no coincidence that "they" are taking things this far when the dollar is so close to losing world reserve currency status. then they can blame the next downturn on "noncompliance" and usher in a new currency, more than likely electronic, which will control us even more.</p>

        <p>I was just talking to my girlfriend about this. </p>
<p>What can I do to help push back? I see all these horrible things happening, and I am sick of standing on the sidelines. I have nothing but free time on my hands, but I am just one person. I wish I could make a difference, but I lack guidance… </p>
<p>I don’t even know where to start.</p>
<p>Participating in the conversation online isn’t enough. I wish I could find a group of like minded individuals that had some sort of experienced leadership that could coordinate to do something… anything other than bitching and moaning online.</p>
<p>All I can think to do is to show up to a town hall meeting in my small community.</p>
