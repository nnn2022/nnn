    <strong>Genuine question: How does faking a pandemic benefit the government?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm trying to have an open mind and understand the PoV of this subreddit, in Australia we seem to be fully back to normal (except travel to other countries is troublesome).</p>
<p>I'm not sure that I fully understand what the motivations would be from those who might be "behind" it all. Any other further reading would be helpful!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></p>

        <p>Not sure how I can prove my legitimacy, but fair enough if you think I am on some sort of espionage mission?</p>
<p>What is an alternative appropriate way to find out more information, if not by posting? I read your link, I can understand where you are coming from, but it seems like a trade-off between sharing your view and stopping infiltrators - a hard balance.</p>
<p>I have been reading this sub and I see a general theme of "elites" or "higher-ups" who are staging covid, or making it out to be a bigger issue than it currently is. What I am trying to understand is what the angle that these types are playing at, and what is their pay-off. Is there a different website or something I can read to understand?</p>

        <p>It's just one example of how people in power have profited off of this situation.</p>
<p>I don't proclaim there to be some big conspiracy out there, nor do I think this virus is fake, nor am I anti-vax.  But when I notice such a staggering degree of stifling free speech  and open debate on <em>any</em> topic, it raises red flags.</p>
<p>Like the early 2000's post 9/11 patriotism rhetoric, you're with us or against us BS.  In a free society there should always be room for debate.</p>

        <p>Ah yes, I was aware of that whole thing, and I think it's completely fucked. From my perspective (a non-US person) there seemed to be a lot of publicly aired and extremely questionable things under the Trump administration. My sense would be that this is obviously not limited to his administration, but I was certainly exposed to a lot more because of the media surrounding him. </p>
<p>Completely also agree with the debate point of view - which was why I found the comment asking people to downvote and ignore a little shocking. It seems like a community like this would benefit from being challenged to be able to put some good arguments into the air</p>

        <p>I think there is a history of people "debating" in bad faith here.  I haven't been here long so I'm not the best person to give an account, but from what I've seen people here are either lock-step with the subs general opinion or they're an outsider coming here just to shit on subbed members.</p>
<p>The media was wild during the Trump days.  Funny how big of a deal, for example, kids in cages were 9 months ago, but now under Biden there's even more locked up kids but basically no one cares.  I even saw an expose on NPR about it then searched for the article here and absolutely nothing came up.</p>
<p>Obama &amp; Trump had many of the exact same policies but Obama got a free pass while Trump got crucified.  Not a fan of either for various reasons but I like seeing a level playing field.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's understandable. I think it's an interesting sub, personally I am not convinced - at least in Australia - that world leaders are conspiring with each other, because we seem to be minimally impacted by covid anymore(again, in Aus), unless I am ignorant to what is happening. </p>
<p>So to me, it seems like it doesn't (yet?) make sense for it to be a "global" conspiracy, emphasis on global</p>

        <p>I agree 100%.  <em>IF</em> there is a covid related conspiracy, I believe it is on the national level rather than global.  <em>If.</em></p>
<p>Where I live is basically back to 2019.  Aside from politicians profiting off of things and public debate on anything covid19 being essentially taboo, I haven't seen anything that screams conspiracy to me.  </p>
<p>What I do see is a bunch of fat old fucks bumbling their way through a pandemic that we could have handled worlds better than we did.</p>

        <p>So primarily you feel that the cause of it all is generated from the pharma companies? So the big pharma companies who invented the vaccines planned it from the beginning?</p>
<p>Or is it that pharma is causing the enforcement of masks stay longer than it should have? </p>
<p>I guess it raises further questions for me, is it that the whole thing is a hoax, or the feeling is that the response is over the top, and is over the top on purpose?</p>

        <p>I think government saw an excuse to make it a huge deal and strip away freedoms and gain more control/power. They did that for themselves (the govt) and then Pharma obviously wanted to capitalize on it. Pharma is one of the biggest lobbyists in the world, they basically own most politicians so they will always be working for them. Most people would agree it's not a 100 percent hoax. They had a sliver of truth and didn't let that fear go to waste. They capitalized on it in an evil and criminal way.</p>

        <p>If you consider being an isolated hermit nation that won't let its own citizens enter or leave and doesn't look to be doing so until at least 2022 'normal' I feel sad for you.  I have an uncle there that just had a stroke (had the AZ vax a couple months ago but let's not go there) hope his situation doesn't decline because no one abroad will be going to his funeral.  Don't you feel sorry for anyone in the tourism industry?</p>
<p>Don't you also have continual harsh lockdowns and ridiculous mask mandates like having to wear one by yourself in your car?  Only allowed to leave the house for 1 hour to exercise?</p>
<p>These things aren't normal.  You've just been conditioned to think they are.</p>

        <p>There are all kinds of hypothetical reasons for it.  </p>
<p>But for my part, I generally lean towards pretty much being just a combination of government incompetence and opportunism on the part of specific individuals both within and without said government.  </p>
<p>Basically, Mr. Incompetence and Mr. Opportunism met in the middle, and sowed their chaos across the world. When incompetence realized he had made a huge mistake, he didn't want to admit it, for fear of appearing foolish and suffering what would likely be irreparable damage to his credibility. But Mr. Opportunism, being a clever little deviant, continued to exploit the situation in order to further his varied, self-serving objectives for the sake of personal profit and power.  </p>
<p>Now, as I stated at the start, there are also other possible reasons, mostly more on the...<em>nefarious</em> side of things. Not all of them are outlandish, either. But for the sake of this discussion, I'm only getting into the one that I believe is <em>most</em> likely.</p>

        <p>Yea I don’t think that everyone here believes in some giant conspiracy - I lean more toward the snake eating it’s own tail regarding hysteria inducing and fact evading msm, opportunistic knee jerk politicians, greed, and general lack of scientific literacy in many areas. I think the big push for vaccination for example is a marketing and risk management play to make it more difficult to determine any long term adverse effects</p>

        <p>I like the explanation and I think that the incompetence part seems very rational, there was a lot of dumb decisions in Australian govt. also which I noticed, primarily around our Prime Minister dissapearing when it all went down. Now he seems to be back and taking the praise for the work of his subordinate State ministers.  </p>
<p>So what do you think is Mr. Opportunism's payout (other than the obv money), and who do you think it is? To me, it doesn't make sense to be "big pharma" because in order to incentivise vaccinations it would be some sort of returning freedom (are lock down rules massively in effect in the US?). We could speculate that they will try to find a new way to give more vaccinations, but I don't think we have seen any evidence of that yet?</p>

        <p>Well, profit and power are generally intertwined. Big pharma got a big payout on the taxpayer's dime, in addition to a lot of positive (and free) PR, largely from the same types of people who would have been loudly protesting (but mostly just tweeting) about how bad and evil they were prior to all of this. They've already been paid for the doses, as is my understanding. It's the government's job to convince people from there.</p>
<p>Another obvious one goes back to the beginning, and pertains specifically (well, mostly) to the United States. It is plainly obvious that the Democrats seized the opportunity to wield COVID as a political WMD against President Trump. And I think it worked.</p>
<p>I mean, I am a (Canadian) Trump supporter myself, but...if I were a politician, I would have done the same thing. There is a significant amount of Machiavellianism, Narcissism, and flat-out psychopathy among the political and business elites. It's my view that a certain degree of these "dark triad" traits are simply necessary in order to make it in these spheres to begin with. I'm an entrepreneur myself, with a pretty successful business as far as local/regional goes. I don't shy away from admitting that I share these same traits as well. Machiavellianism in particular.</p>
<p>Having "dark triad" traits doesn't automatically mean that a person is "evil" or what  have you, though. I believe that Machiavellianism is the "most important" aspect, in the sense of having the most utility. Narcissism comes next, though it isn't particularly useful. Psychopathy is prevalent as well, but not as much. It is the most commonly-known, but also misunderstood. Actual psychopaths tend to have extremely poor impulse-control. I believe that there are many politicians who embody this trait to varying degrees, alongside the other two, but they are on the whole less effective than those who are more Machiavellian in nature.</p>
<p>But these are just my hypothetical musings, I suppose.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply and sharing your thoughts around these traits - I think it makes sense that there would be a correlation between an elevated compared self-worth vs. "success" in a business sense. </p>
<p>My impression from your response is that you don't think pharma is an ongoing engine in covid not going away - is that accurate?</p>
<p>Do you think that covid will be used as a recurring political mechanism by both parties then? I guess it would make sense. </p>
<p>Also, I am wondering who you see Mr. Incompetence as, if not Trump?</p>

        <p>I think there's collusion between government players and big business players ("Big Pharma" included) across the board. That's been the case for decades, though. Nothing new about that. I think the persistence of COVID has more to do with the government simply not wanting to admit they fucked up. It comes down to the credibility issue I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>It will probably be used as a political weapon for a while. Mostly from the left-wing parties (Democrats in the US, Liberals in Canada), since they were the ones who got to it first. In the US, if the political situations were reversed, I'm certain that the Republicans would have done much the same thing. Like I said, it's what I would have done. And if I can think up something like this, you'd best believe that the politicians and their strategists will have thought of it too.</p>
<p>As for the last thing, the Democrats had been miring President Trump in an endless deluge of interference from before he even assumed office. He even met tremendous resistance from within his own party. Although I am of the view that President Trump was never actually a "Republican". He simply used them as a vehicle to achieve his own ends, and to great success. After all, he won the presidency in spite of everything. But he was never "supposed" to win. His victory was essentially a refutation of the entire establishment.</p>
<p>I think that the "old guard" (which includes various levels of "the establishment", including the legacy media) was actually completely blindsided by it. And so they spent the subsequent years of his presidency throwing everything they had at him. It really was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Back to the point, though. Early on, I recall him urging caution as early as late January, and floating the idea of border closures and flight restrictions not long after. At this time, the Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, went in the complete opposite direction, and brazenly claimed that there was "nothing to be concerned about" and encouraged people to go out and celebrate the Chinese New Year in large gatherings.</p>
<p>After that, it devolved into the Democrats and the Trump Administration engaging in aggressive political theater against one another. Personally (and probably to no big surprise), I side with President Trump on this, but not just because I am a supporter. I happen to be of the belief that the virus itself was never actually nearly as big of a problem as it was made out to be. The combination of incompetence and opportunism was what caused it to blow up.</p>
<p>To clarify: I do not personally consider "three million deaths" to be a significant number on a global scale. This is something like 0.037% of the global population. And also, being generous, because as per the CDC, only some 5% of the total fatalities in the US were "with COVID alone". Because of this, I view COVID as more of a "complication" than a direct cause. Most people who reach the average life expectancy range die due to complications that arise as a natural consequence of the body failing. This is nothing new, and should not have come as any big surprise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we actually have been due for a mass influx of elderly deaths, due to the historically large percentage of elderly individuals. The average life expectancy experienced a significant increase over the course of the 20th century, but has since stagnated in more recent times, having been in the vicinity of the mid-80's since the late 90's going forward. The conversation about "old age security" has been ongoing for a very long time. But death comes part and parcel with old age as well. This really was inevitable.</p>
<p>Though, again, I do not consider three million (or thereabouts) deaths to actually be significant anyway. And 5% of that is even less so.</p>
<p>I accept that many people disagree with this assessment. That's fine. We all have our own standards. I think that discussing it in the context of an overall percentage rather than a "big" (though not really) number puts it into a more accurate perspective, though.</p>

        <p>I'm also not understanding, if it is a control mechanism then why would all world leaders be "in on it", especially where leaders from warring nations seem to all be saying similar things (from my perspective).</p>
<p>If it's for profit, then why would the "elite" stop people from going outside and travelling, that seems like a blow to GDP, particularly for smaller countries where tourism is a large income stream. </p>

        <p>What do you feel I will get from reading the bible? I have read part of it during school, but I would appreciate if you could elaborate a little bit?</p>
<p>I can see what you are saying about war being an image that leaders are trying to portray (although, to be transparent, I am not convinced) - I might just be misinformed, but thinking about the US vs. Iraq war for oil, what benefits would the leaders be getting for causing loyal soldiers to kill other loyal soldiers. Wouldn't the better fight be between loyal vs. radicalised?</p>

        <p>the Bible contains the truth. I cannot spoonfeed it to you. make your own revelations. I suggest reading it in a quiet, peaceful place, you'll get more out of it</p>
<p>why do you think there ARE loyal soldiers? wars make loyalty</p>

        <p>That is an interesting comment about war making soldiers, I will mull over that. </p>
<p>Regarding the bible, it just seems very left-of-field that the bible would have any relevance to this. I'm not really asking you to spoonfeed it to me - nor do I want you to - but I am keen to understand why you feel it is relevant, or what themes cross-over between the bible and what I am asking here</p>

        <p>I'm not trying to be rude, I'm trying to be honest - I'm sorry that my message came across that way, the three dots were probably more passive aggressive than I had intended. </p>
<p>I'm genuinely asking you for some specificity around what you are advising me to do, and why the bible has relevance, but you are telling me to essentially just figure out your point, why can't you just help</p>
