        <p>And if one alone <em>would</em> have killed you? And the other wouldn't? The other commenter already addressed your shoe lace analogy, so let's bring it back to the COVID patient. If you were crushed by an Indiana Jones style boulder, but you also tested positive for COVID on your deathbed, should you be added to the COVID death count?

        <p>Your logic is horrible right now.</p>
<p>I can easily dismantle what you said with the brainpower of a toddler</p>
<p>If your shoe came untied in the exact same manner in a situation without the boulder, you would not die. In fact, your shoe has come untied before and you didn't get smashed by a giant boulder and die. I think it's safe to say, THE cause of death was the boulder regardless of shoestrings.</p>

        <p>Its frustrating that you lower yourself to starting out with insults, what is the point? Do you want to actually have a discussion or what is it you are trying to achieve? </p>
<p>And entirely miss the point of the analogy, and then try to claim superiority, for some reason? There is no need for that.</p>
<p>The idea is that it is the combination of two factors that kill you, if your shoelaces didn't come undone you wouldn't die, if the boulder wasn't there you wouldn't die.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with shoe laces as an object, the boulder and shoe laces are just used as an analogy for things that can cause death when combined with something like covid, when without either you might not have died, thus the 'with' covid is used.</p>

        <p>I guess we just disagree on the logic. I still think it's absurd.</p>
<p>Did the shoelace lead to the boulder killing him? Yes.</p>
<p>Did the twinkie lead to the diabetic coma that killed him? Yes</p>
<p>Cause of death: shoelace (not boulder)</p>
<p>is equal to</p>
<p>Cause of death: twinkie (not diabetes)</p>
<p>What doctor would ever label the cause of death twinkie?</p>
<p>I don't need records, there are gov speakers blatantly stating that anyone who had covid and died of ANYTHING, it is labeled as a covid death.</p>
<p>By this logic, no death should EVER be attributed to diabetes, we should start attributing deaths to sugar, twinkies, skittles, soda, etc</p>

        <p>so because they stated that such things could happen, it means they do happen?<br>
I am sure you can see that is a bit illogical?</p>
<p>And your examples do not seem relevant to the statements I've made.</p>
<p>People are included in the "with covid" statistics because people might have survived if either affect didn't happen.</p>
<p>If you have diabetis and eat twinkies then you die from both, because you might not have died from your diabetis, if you didn't eat twinkies, which is what "with covid" indicates.</p>
<p>So your examples are wrong and would be something like them being added in the "eating twinkies" statistics for the comparison to work.</p>
<p>And last I checked, and correct me when I am wrong, 'with covid' has nothing to do with what is on the death certificate, but rather about it being included in the statistics about covid, for the cause of death you'd need to see people's individual death certificate, which could be a lot of things, people have died from strokes which was caused by cloths formed because of covid and similar.</p>

        <p>Yeah but last I checked somewhere around 4% of wu flu deaths were also coded with accidental or intentional injuries and poisonings. So without getting into an issues around whether or not some other illness would have killed you anyway, we’ve got a fair chunk that are obviously only with and no of.</p>

        <p>I get the theory behind that but what is the actual evidence of such cases happening? I've heard a lot of people saying it happens with very little actual points to reports of it happening.</p>

        <p>So we are just gonna ignore the fact that the boulder is undeniably the thing that killed you because untied shoelaces do not cause death? It can lead to death. But what can't? A loving kiss can lead to death. A nice word of encouragement can lead to death. Drinkin water can lead to death. I drank water today, it's been in my system all day, a car hits me, did I die of water or the car?</p>
<p>I just think your point was illogical and it seemed like you portrayed it in a light that would take the heat off of the horribly inflated numbers that lead to overreactions and lockdowns.</p>
<p>This isn't arguing for the sake of arguing. It's arguing for honesty. <strong>A doctor who says the patient died of untied shoes is not being honest</strong></p>

        <p>You are once again ignoring that it is an analogy, I could just as easily have used something else. </p>
<p>You are fixating on something entirely out of the context of my statement.</p>
<p>I am not taking the heat of anything, I am not defending sloppy work.</p>
<p>I am saying the term 'with' has merit because if whatever else condition you had, and covid on its own might not kill you, but the combination will.</p>
<p>You are stating numbers are overinflated, could you point me to where you have seen evidence of this?</p>
<p>Or are you just taking the theory that they could be over inflated, because at least from the video about the State of Illinois, it is mentioned that 'with' could be used in cases where there is clearly another cause of death?  </p>
<p>One thing is the theory that it can happen, but we need to look at the evidence that the inflation does happen. That is the logical and systematic approach, I believe everyone should use, otherwise people are just fanning the flames of mistrust and similar emotions, which is not productive.  </p>
<p>So I would gladly read what documentation you have that indicates that the numbers are overinflated.</p>

        <p>Lol your example is perfect actually.  The way they are using “with” for “dying with covid” is exactly in your example like saying you “died “with shoelaces”.</p>

<p>Is it against the sub rules to call that commenter via the u/ function? I want to know if that person will admit how insanely wrong they were and that they were spreading misinformation.</p>

<p>&rt;Findings of these studies suggest that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection via the fomite transmission route is low, and generally less than 1 in 10,000, which means that each contact with a contaminated surface has less than a 1 in 10,000 chance of causing an infection 7, 8, 9.</p>
<p>1 in 10,000 chance of infection with a supposedly contaminated surface.  Keep everything SHUT DOWN!!!!!!!</p>

        <p>I got it from her, to be fair.  I'm definitely not in the CORVID19-OMG camp, in fact I pretty strongly oppose most of the government regulations and lockdowns around it - but you fools treating it like a joke aren't helping anyone. People <em>are</em> dying. Obviously it isn't being handled well in most places, but I don't think any of you could do any better given the chance</p>

<p>You people are a fucking menace. Ignorant and dangerous. Stating facts is what I'm doing. I witnessed the virus take a serious toll on a loved one firsthand, and the response I get here? "pics or it didn't happen". Virtue signal my ass, you are a bunch or delusional clowns. The governments handling of this mess is one thing, but to think that this is a "pathetic weak ass virus" across the board is something else entirely.</p>

        <p>You gave the impression of refuting my claim (that Covid is not, in fact, a weak ass  virus and you are a bunch of clowns for thinking it's that simple), but actually didn't address it - and instead brought up an arbitrary example that doesn't relate in the slightest. What is the direct comparison of "ban cars" in relation to the point I was making? This is pretty definitively a strawman. As for calling my example anecdotal, I could offer up her positive covid test, and hospital records, etc. - and you would likely still go "FAKE".</p>

        <p>Masks and social distancing are only really applicable in public places ie the grocery store. Nobody is charging you for walking down the street without a mask. They (businesses) are within their rights to refuse service, just as you are to not wear a mask or stay the hell away from people. Lockdowns, applicable in relation to I guess public spaces? Parks, etc. I don't think going to the bar is within the legal or even arbitrary ramifications of "muh freedoms". Vaccine passports, border closings. Other countries absolutely have the right to refuse you entry for whatever reason they please. Americans don't automatically get the "right" or "freedom" to just hop over to Canada, for example</p>

        <p>Protests never stopped. BLM has been steady throughout the pandemic. Anti-mask protests are frequent here (Toronto area). There are no repercussions to them. Having guests at your home falls under the coward category. Unlikely to be enforced, and likely thrown out of court if it were. Absolutely infringing on rights</p>
