    <strong>I might lose my family to Covid</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a left-leaning area and everywhere I go is constant reminders about wearing a mask, social distancing, etc. And pretty much everyone follows it. I have been a skeptic of these lockdowns after the initial two week period to "flatten the curve". Here we are 9 months later and it's only gotten worse. Now restaurants are closed, families and friends won't see each other, and everyone just sees other people as simply agents of pestilence that will kill someone somehow.</p>
<p>In my family, I am the only one really questioning all this bs. My mom and sister just fall in line and do whatever the TV and governor tells them to do. They always say, well eventually things will get back to normal. As if the powers that be will ever let that happen.</p>
<p>Today, my sister said something that really shook me to my core. She said, "You know, wearing a mask is so engrained in me at this point, even when I watch TV and I people not wearing one in a store, my first thought is they should wear one." She then went on further and said, "This pandemic has made more aware of how dirty everything is. Whenever I touch a surface or a door handle, I think of how many other people touched it and what they might spread. I hope masks actually stay, the thought of sharing the same air as others freaks me out a little bit."</p>
<p>My heart dropped into my stomach after she said that. How can anyone think like that? Even without getting into whether or not masks are effective, that line of thinking is so disturbing. It's so inhumane viewing people only as spreaders of disease instead of individuals to possibly befriend or members of a community.</p>
<p>I know during this next year, I will have to somehow fight back against this nonsense and take back my rights and liberties. But it will most likely cost me my family. The thought of this really saddens me, but at a certain point I have to stand up for what I believe in. For once, I will have to do something that will make a difference, but it will cost a lot.</p>
<p>Seeing online communities (like this one), forums, and alternative platforms though, does give me some hope. Hopefully, we start our own communities and families that respect and show dignity towards each other. I just wanted to share my story so others in similar situations know they're not alone and together we can overcome this!</p></p>

        <p>Hey there! Just wanted to let you know you’re not alone! My husband and I have lost many family members to the hysteria. They think we’re radicals for trying to live life as normally as possible as well as attending anti lockdown protests. I have family who viewed the COVID vaccine as their hill to die on, now saying “well maybe after a couple of months I’d consider it.” 
The brainwashing is phenomenal. I underestimated the government and the mockingjay media. We’re the underdog for sure, but please know you’re not alone. I will not give in, EVER. This governmental/medical tyranny is my actual hill to die on.
I won’t give in, you shouldn’t either.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply. Soon mandatory vaccination will be required. If not by the government, then by all the major companies to do business with them. That will be the moment there will be no more fence-sitters and everyone will need to make a decision of which side they're on. I hope that most of your friends and family join you.</p>

        <p>I agree completely. That’s where we’re headed. And when I predicted everything up to this point to family and friends I was called a conspiracy theorist. I already see people who, two months ago were willing to fight, beginning to bend to the masses. It’s depressing, and I struggle somedays to see any hope. But I’m glad there’s others out there willing to stand up. I will never bow down to this, I hope there’s many others I’m not seeing.</p>

        <p>Question: do you think close family (parents, siblings, in laws, cousins, aunts, uncles) will give in to the mandatory vaccination agenda? Like if they categorize us as outsiders? I’d love to think my family would never see me as a threat for just being a breathing, thinking, human being... but after the last few months I’m just not sure I’m too optimistic. It seems the media and the “public opinion” can sway people to do just about anything, even turn on their family member...</p>
<p>I pray I’m wrong, but I can easily see it going there.</p>

        <p>Sadly, yes. It's become clear to me how willing people are to accept tyranny so along as it's served with a smile and they're told, "it's for the greater good." But, perhaps in the end it will be a good thing to separate ourselves from people who we can only get along on a surface level. We can develop new, meaningful relationships with like-minded individuals.</p>

        <p>I’ve had to limit contact with my family, so I understand the pain. They’re very progressive and are completely in line with everything the msm tells them. They thought the whole thing was overblown at first, but they believed everything by June. They’re extremely terrified now that it’s almost Christmas. </p>
<p>It hurts a lot to be cut off from them, but they always bring up covid stuff and they know my opinion. It leads to fights and arguments and it’s me against all of them. Some of my family members have said some pretty awful things to me for questioning the lockdowns. I was completely taken aback at first, but now I just expect to be hated by my family members for having different opinions. It’s made this whole covid year a lot worse, and it’s definitely made me angrier/sadder about this whole scenario, but it is what it is. </p>
<p>I’ve found a few people who share my opinions and it makes life better to know I’m not alone. </p>
<p>If the msm starts talking about how stupid lockdowns and mandates are, then my family and other families would probably return to normal.</p>

        <p>&rt;The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy -- everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. <strong>No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer</strong>. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now.</p>
<p>&rt;There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always -- do not forget this, Winston -- always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face -- for ever.</p>

<p>Absolutely nailed it. I couldn't think of a way to put it into words, and this is it. Maybe this is why it's so incredibly insulting when others jump back screeching SIX FEET! Because, as you stated above - are nothing more than a vessel to spread the disease.</p>

        <p>&rt;I just wanted to share my story so others in similar situations know they're not alone and together we can overcome this! </p>
<p>You have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ij6yu9/experiences_in_the_clownvid19_dystopia_or_a/">no idea</a> just how <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jkn4an/a_disturbing_realization_about_the_new_abnormal/">not alone</a> you are, my brother/sister. I've been writing dissertations about how half my family has turned into complete zombies thanks to the Mockingbird media. (My brother sees himself as a necromancer of sorts however). </p>
<p>And keep in mind, my experiences aren't the worst by ANY stretch of the imagination. Plenty of people in these parts have even worse accounts than mine.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing that. It reminds of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/19967-of-all-tyrannies-a-tyranny-sincerely-exercised-for-the-good">this quote</a> by C.S. Lewis. I'm sorry about your family. How do you deal with the fact that you know you will eventually have to leave and be disowned by them?</p>

<p>Two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jesus </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>righteous fury I feel towards the new abnormal pushers (especially Corona "News" Network) and vain hope that they'll be held accountable for their crimes against humanity. In this life, I mean.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about it, honestly.</p>

        <p>Some people are weak and whilst this doesn't make them bad it can make them dangerous. Keep asking questions about this as well as what sort of world you want to live in. Just because others don't, or even can't, think about the future in this way never means you shouldn't. </p>
<p>It's not worth getting too upset with these people just because of their limitations. Think of it like you would a pet. You may love your dog as part of the family, but you would never copy it's behaviour when it comes to health or long term planning.</p>

        <p>I don’t have the studies offhand but I believe the Amish have the lowest rates of allergies, asthma and auto immune disorder in first world countries.  Why?  Because they grow up with dirt, animals and dust.</p>
<p>I wonder if there’s going to be a tsunami of kids developing auto immunities over the next decade because they aren’t getting sick normally.  I have three kids under 4 and was happy this year when we got colds (hell maybe Covid we don’t go to the doctor for sniffles and low fevers) and a short gastro flu.  It’s literally good for you.</p>
