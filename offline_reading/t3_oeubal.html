    <strong>Using Google Trends to unravels the lies</strong>
    <p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Check out "Google Trends"</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of "Google Trends" yet, allow me to explain:</p>
<p>At one point in Google's history, the executives decided that the best way to please investors was to release a chunk of user data to the public. So to increase their stock price, they created <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US">Google Trends</a>, a site where you can plug in a search query (ie. "Who is Kim Kardashian"), and it will graph the <em>popularity</em> of that search over time. </p>
<p>So we have this tool now, but what about when you consider the fact that Google is a prominent leader in the "battle against misinformation" (ie. censoring our opinions). Plug in "Google Trends" into <em>Google Trends</em>, you'll find that the overall interest in this <strong>free and open</strong> tool is on the rise. Therefore, it is only a matter of time before this treasure trove of information is scrubbed from history.</p>
<p>What information we could harvest from this source? Type in "Covid Variant". You'll find that up until December 2020, the buzz was <em>nearly zero</em>. Then it spiked in that month, the same month that the ~~vaccine~~ inoculation was released! So why is it that Covid variants only became a "problem" (enough to be searched) as this experiment hit the public?</p>
<p>I encourage you to start experimenting with this yourself. My goal with this post is to gather as much information as possible before it all gets deleted. So everyone reading this should either: A. Share their discoveries, B. Create a list of relevant search terms, or C. Save and share data from this source, so that we can access it even when the website goes down.</p></p>

<p>This curve became really flat really fast! :D</p>
