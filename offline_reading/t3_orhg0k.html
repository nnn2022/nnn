    <strong>Quotes from 1984, that ridiculously relate to reality right now and hits home.</strong>
    <p><p>“2 + 2 = 5”</p>
<p>“War is peace. 
Freedom is slavery. 
Ignorance is strength.”</p>
<p>“If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.”</p>
<p>“Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.”</p>
<p>“Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.
“</p>
<p>“Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.”</p>
<p>“The choice for mankind lies between freedom and happiness and for the great bulk of mankind, happiness is better.”</p>
<p>“It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words”</p>
<p>“Sanity is not statistical.”</p>
<p>“The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those that speak it.”</p>
<p>“The object of terrorism is terrorism. The object of oppression is oppression. The object of torture is torture. The object of murder is murder. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?”</p>
<p>“In a time of deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act”</p></p>

        <p>&rt;“Sanity is not statistical.”</p>
<p>These are all beautiful quotes.  But this one in particular stands out for me today.</p>
<p>How many times have we been told, and how often are we reminded of, the statistics involved in why we must submit to an experimental medical procedure?</p>
<p>"The odds of having an adverse reaction is extremely rare."</p>
<p>So?  That doesn't help someone who has had an adverse reaction.  That doesn't mean you have to submit yourself to something you are uncomfortable doing.</p>

<p>“Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete. Reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks, photographs—all had to be rectified at lightning speed. Although no directive was ever issued, it was known that the chiefs of the Department intended that within one week no reference to the war with Eurasia, or the alliance with Eastasia, should remain in existence anywhere.”</p>

        <p>"The woman down there had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm heart, and a fertile belly. He wondered how many children she had given birth to. It might easily be fifteen. She had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps, of wildrose beauty, and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending, scrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grandchildren, over thirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still singing."</p>
