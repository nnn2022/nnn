    <strong>Why aren‚Äôt we getting inundated with messages about hand washing?</strong>
    <p><p>We‚Äôre in the middle of the most fearsome pandemic known to man yet no one, anywhere, is mentioning the vital role that washing your hands plays in disease prevention.</p>
<p>I remember it being briefly mentioned at the very start of the pandemic but it is NEVER mentioned anymore. It should be on every mask sign and PSA. There should be reminders posted everywhere, because if want to find an issue where the science really truly is kind of settled, it‚Äôs that proper hand hygiene is one of the biggest things a person can do to stop the spread of disease.</p>
<p>And yet, they never seem to talk about it. I‚Äôve probably heard less about hand washing in the last year than any other year of my entire life. Every flu season it gets mentioned, along with the instructions about how to properly wash your hands ‚Äî song the Happy Birthday song, use mildly warm water, etc.</p>
<p>Funny how they just forgot to mention this as a tool we can use in our arsenal to defeat the virus. </p>
<p>If nothing else, shouldn‚Äôt clean hands be a priority because of the all mighty masks? After all, clean hands = clean mask. Shouldn‚Äôt they be encouraging us to do all that we can to sterilize and protect the sanctity of our incredible life-saving masks? If my mask protects you, then doesn‚Äôt my contaminated, dirty mask pose a danger to your health? </p>
<p>Also, next time someone brings up the old, ‚ÄúOh, so if you don‚Äôt believe in masks I guess you‚Äôd be perfectly fine with your surgeon not wearing one, huh?‚Äù I‚Äôm going to say, ‚ÄúWhen was the last time you washed your hands? You should really be scrubbing in like a surgeon anytime your hands come into contact with your mask. Because if you‚Äôre not washing your hands diligently then you are spreading disease. And I guess you‚Äôd also be comfortable with your surgeon not washing his hands before he does surgery?</p></p>

        <p>Because it's not divisive, and it's hard to use to virtue-signal. Almost everyone does it at least some of the time. You can't instantly tell by looking who's washed their hands and who hasn't, unless their hands are visibly nasty for no other obvious reason or you were right there when they left the bathroom. People aren't going to get tons of likes on Instagram for posting a hand-washing selfie (and they'd be hard to take!)</p>
<p>Basically hand-washing has little signaling value. It's a practical thing to do regardless of what you think about common cold. Someone washing their hands doesn't tell you which "team" they're on, while the worthless mitigation strategies often do, so those get more attention.</p>

        <p>Because hand washing with the most abundant resource on earth (water) isn't nearly as profitable as hand sanitizer, personal protective equipment, masks, thermometers, body scanners, facial recognition technologies, police enforcement, systems engineering, etc. Or so that's my thought. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

        <p>At leastvin Romania there are posters plastered everywhere about washing hands along the ones with masks. Funny thing is the ones at my work are old and never got replaced so they still say "only wear a mask if you have sympthoms or have beennin contact with somebody positive"</p>

        <p>That's a good question. I have a multitude of thoughts on hand washing, but it's the sanitizer, not the soap and water, that has been a concern of mine from the start. I think the powers that be are simply satisfied that enough people are using the hand-washing stations. (I do wear a mask everywhere I'm asked to, and I'm too stressed out to pick battles. If people are nice about asking me to sanitize, fine. If they're rude, I can and have turned around and walked out the door. But I don't get vocal and complain- my brain punishes me for things like that late at night when I can't sleep)</p>
<p>But, whenever I go into a store my first task <em>is</em> to avoid the hand sanitizer, if I can. I'm a soap and water person anyways, the sanitizer feels like lube, grosses me out, and I always note the behaviour of people I know who use it so regularly I get the sense it's become some kind of comforting addiction. It's disgusting to watch. It's also troubling, like some passive-aggressive indicator that I'm a threat. There's an "automatic" obsessive compulsion for people to use it. I know I'm better off digging my hands in the garden. I actually can't help but imagine everyone that's using the sanitizer is really just lathering themselves with lube, but really, that shit is a problem. </p>
<p>Over-hygienic practices lead to allergies. I'm convinced that's why you can't bring peanut-butter sandwiches into schools anymore, where I live. Never had that issue 20 years before in the school system. Another example: people who overuse mouthwash are at greater risk of developing thrush. They might as well start selling gallons of Nystatin alongside these products. It's funny to me that I'm sickened by the "cleanliness" of everyone, but also I tend to view much of society as "sterile" anyhow.</p>
<p>It's probably my fault. I listened to this TAL podcast a long time ago.  <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/404/enemy-camp-2010/act-three-0">https://www.thisamericanlife.org/404/enemy-camp-2010/act-three-0</a></p>
<p>But I simply cannot be swayed otherwise anymore. I'm convinced that as a society, we're too f$%king clean. I'm not pigpen, I won't go eating worms, but I'll jump in a lake and get in the mud because it's far better for my immunity than bathing my hands in disinfectant.</p>
<p>But if I'm in a shop, and wash my hands, say in the washroom of a restaurant or gas station, there's no damn way I'm going to seek out a sanitizing station or a washroom in the shop next door. Never, ever.</p>
