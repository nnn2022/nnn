    <strong>Only 52% of hyper-liberal NYC is fully vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone in NYC that wanted to get vaccinated EASILY could have gotten it by now. I'm pretty surprised by that. Maybe there are millions of people there that secretly hold reservations about it.</p></p>

        <p>I am in New York City and for quite a while I've been feeling like they're lying to us about the amount of vaccinated people. They are making it seem like nearly everyone is vaccinated but I know quite a few people who are adamantly against this and I work in healthcare so it's not like I am around people who don't understand medicine. I have spoken to at least five of my co-workers who are refusing to do this, it's probably going to be mandated where I am and we are all submitting letters drafted by an attorney for exemptions which I'm sure are going to be denied but we have to fight this. If they deny this we're going to chip in and get an attorney. I don't even care if it fails and if we get fired anyway they need push back against this. I have been at this job for 17 years, I thought I would retire from here. It is stable and I have great benefits but if it comes down to it I will give it all up if I have to because I am refusing to submit to regular injections for the rest of my working years. This is not a regular shot. And even the flu shot was voluntary. This has turned political. It's not about our health at all. I am now a remote worker and they're threatening remote workers how does that even make sense? They are saying it's for the community, I call bullshit. As far as people being unvaccinated here, the largest segment of the population that is unvaccinated are African Americans yet they are blaming white conservatives. That is a lie.</p>
<p>I am at the point where I'm prepared to be fired. I'm terrified I cry a lot and I have a severe stomach ache for the past few days. I know my life is about to fall apart but I'm just not going to do this. I've never felt so strongly about anything in my entire life. I'm trusting in God right now, that he will take me where I need to be and it's obviously not where I am right now. I really really hope that if this is true and there are a lot of unvaccinated people out there that they are prepared to stand up like I am because it's not even about this vaccine, it's about medical freedom and autonomy over your own body. If people agree to this it opens a door that is extremely dangerous and will be detrimental to our children's future. We can't go in this direction. This has nothing to do with being an anti vaxxer or whatever other insult they hurl.</p>

        <p>I'm not in New York, but everyone I see when out and about is fully vaccinated so I think the government's tracking numbers must be off.</p>
<p>Go with me here. All the stores have a sign up that says "you can enter without a mask IF you're fully vaccinated" and no one inside has a mask on, so they all must be fully vaccinated, right?</p>
<p>Actually, I don't have a mask on either so I must be fully vaccinated as well. Hmm, I don't remember getting the shot, but I guess I must have. üòâ</p>
