    <strong>MY Life is Not About YOU, or Society!</strong>
    <p><p>I have had enough.</p>
<p>I've been fighting against the new normal since the beginning, for over a year I've done my best to make people understand what's going on. One of my oldest comments that I can still find is me providing scientific sources for someone who had SEEMED to be interested in reasonable discussion. Turned out they were only arguing in bad faith as they made no attempt to counter those sources or respond at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j88ki9/covid_19_has_done_more_to_damage_our_liberty_in/g8iyj9a?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j88ki9/covid_19_has_done_more_to_damage_our_liberty_in/g8iyj9a?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>
<p>I've also gone out of my way to collate and organize my own sources and data.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/iqg2w8/apples_to_oranges_comparing_covid_to_tuberculosis/">https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/iqg2w8/apples_to_oranges_comparing_covid_to_tuberculosis/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ja0icu/small_collection_of_antimask_citations_sources/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ja0icu/small_collection_of_antimask_citations_sources/</a></p>
<p>And in a year I went from honest intellectual discourse to a point where "bad bot" is now my go-to response whenever I see someone trying to belittle our stance. Because <strong>I have had enough.</strong></p>
<p>Enough of the deliberate lies.</p>
<p>Enough of the attacks.</p>
<p>Enough of the appeals to false authority and anti-science rhetoric.</p>
<p>And if you are reading this and want to shout me down, to shut me up, to call me ignorant or anti-vax or a science-hating redneck... <strong><em>I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU IN PARTICULAR</em></strong>, and I will <strong>NOT</strong> suffer your insanity any longer.</p>
<p>All you damned fools ever, EVER do is fight us. You don't bother trying to understand why we feel this way. You don't compare, you don't <em>THINK</em>. All you do is fight and argue. Well congratulations, you've gotten what you've wanted; you have forced people like me to act in kind. I've given up any thoughts of trying to show the facts or hold any kind of intellectual discourse. What is the point if all you are going to do is scream and holler and tantrum all day and night?</p>
<p>Pro tip: There is no such thing as settled science. Science is always changing. Even gravity as a concept can be challenged. It probably wouldn't be a very good challenge and laughed out of the room, but it <strong>CAN</strong> be. That's the beauty of science. Anyone can come forward with a theory and it can be talked about until a consensus is reached. <strong><em>BUT REFUSING TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT IS ANTI-SCIENCE.</em></strong> Censoring scientists and medical experts is anti-science. Saying the science is settled is <em>unimaginably</em> anti-science! And if you've ever said "the science is settled," then as much as I hate to make an objective statement on a completely subjective quality of my own person - <strong>I KNOW BETTER THAN YOU DO, AND I UNDERSTAND SCIENCE BETTER THAN YOU DO</strong>. And that's that!</p>
<p>You pathetic beings, acting so high and mighty, so compassionate, so virtuous. And yet not a single care could be given for the pandemics of drug use, domestic abuse, cancelled cancer screenings, misattributed COVID deaths, failed COVID test systems, mass starvation, mass hysteria, mass rioting, mass murder, mass ignorance, all caused BY YOU, YOUR KIND AND YOUR PRECIOUS MAINSTREAM MEDIA.</p>
<p>And OF COURSE let's not forget about the amazingly high suicide spikes, for which we <strong>STILL</strong> don't have accurate information on. As well, for which I myself was almost a victim of. That's right, I made an attempt about 8-9 months ago now. I went into that evening a broken person. I came out of it a much better person. And it was precisely because of people like you that I was driven into it. I was incapable of accepting a world stripped of freedom. In a sense, I suppose I should be thankful that you "fixed" me, because now I understand something very, very important.</p>
<p>I don't have to care. Humans are social animals, we care about the thoughts and opinions of those around us- even when we don't want to. This isn't always true, but for most of us, we do care. If we say we don't care, it's usually a lie because we still care a little bit. But that night, something truly changed in me. I'm able to choose where I put my attention, instead of reacting to every little thing. And that's led me to a new conclusion: <strong>The world is worth less than my life.</strong></p>
<p>I choose my path. Not you, not the world, not the news, not <strong>THE SCIENCE</strong> and not society. This is mine. These words are mine. My life is <strong>MINE</strong> alone. And how absolutely <strong>DARE</strong> you to try to change that? That I should change everything about myself to suit YOUR fear? YOUR morality? That I should be forced to follow YOUR rules and adapt to YOUR vision of society?</p>
<p><strong><em>MY LIFE IS NOT ABOUT YOU, OR SOCIETY!</em></strong></p>
<p>I have had enough. I will have no more. If you are anti-NNN, you will be blocked. Period. Please, make it easy and respond here so I can block you without having to say anything to you individually.</p></p>

        <p>Word.</p>
<p>Also, you picked a very, very good example in Gravity. Because gravity is still largely understood as Newton described it. You would see the same madness if you ask people to describe what Gravity is, have them explain to you Newtons Gravity and then tell them they are wrong.</p>
<p>I really dont know why people go so fucking bananas if you dare to question their view of reality. Even when it is easily provable false (as in the gravity example).</p>

        <p>Out of curiosity I did a "Grand Tour" of the pro-vax sub-reddits just prior to reading your posts.</p>
<p>Looks really similar to NNN just reverse who is being insulted (not a great look for NNN, but this is the internet), except for one major difference.</p>
<p>There is ZERO outside information. No articles, no "papers", no "look at this misinformation, help me tear it to shreds", nothing of that nature. No discussion. And I will add, there is quite a bit of "yes to segregation" which is disconcerting.</p>
<p>Are they just so sure of their position there is no need for any further discussion?</p>
<p>Or, in my opinion, if they actually start talking about things then the narrative will start looking mighty flimsy?</p>
<p>Blah! I'm sitting here typing this while worried that the French and/or EU government are going to try a power grab this summer... For our safety of course.</p>

        <p>So glad you have gotten that off your chest. Unfortunate to hear the lengths it took you reach the epiphany however the strength in your words display a stronger individual. I hope others read what you have stated and hope they too wake up without the scare you‚Äôve been through. Well written post, stay well, strong and principled. You aren‚Äôt alone. üëäüèª</p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>I noticed that on one of your original collection of articles someone took the time to refute them, yet you never responded? Why not refute their rebuttal if they nicely explained how your sources were fallible? I‚Äôd like to go over your sources here so maybe some people might realize that doing research is not as easy as reading some memes and then using Bing to find a semi-professional person to agree with you on page 13 of the search results. 
Let‚Äôs throughly go over the sources you cited. Please refute me.
1. Dennis Rancourt. He was a professor of physics, not pathology but anyway let‚Äôs keep going. He was a professor at the University of Ottawa and eventually was banned from campus. Some of the main factors of that were ‚Äòacademic squatting‚Äô (which he was later cleared of) and giving A+ grades to 23 students in one winter course. Later on a law professor from the University sued him for libel and won a 350 thousand dollar settlement. I‚Äôll include these backgrounds into your sources as it speaks for their credibility. Did you check their backgrounds? Or did you just take their papers for fact because they had some kind of degree? Please advise. Bonus info, this guy is also a climate change denier. Not really sure why a Disgraced Canadian physics professor would be your authority on masks but hey diff‚Äôrent strokes for different folks. Even though this guy is clearly a crackpot, let‚Äôs go through his article on River City Reader (haha). The first source your guy cited is a study of 32 Japanese healthcare workers. They were divided into 2 groups, masked and maskless. Both groups got 1 cold. Based on this WHOPPING 32 person study of healthcare workers who are extremely sanitary and take many other precautions outside of masks we decide that proves masks don‚Äôt work? You think a 32 person study is enough to risk so many lives? Really? The second reference your source cited is a paper from Cambridge. I read down to the results section and it states ‚ÄúWhile influenza virus could be detected by RT‚ÄìPCR in all nine volunteers without a mask, no influenza virus could be detected on the Petri dish specimens when participants wore either type of face mask.‚Äù This is the source of your source. Clicking on your link led me here. They are saying that masks are effective but N95 doesn‚Äôt seem to offer additional benefits in this very small study. Your guy claims that this study says there is no benefit from wearing a mask, but his source says differently? That shatters his credibility but let‚Äôs keep going. His next source - influenzajournal.com. This was a 10 year old retroactive study. Again, reading down to the results section I found this: ‚ÄúA trial conducted amongst crowded, urban households found that, despite poor compliance, masks wearing coupled with hand sanitizer use, reduced secondary transmission of upper respiratory infection/influenza-like illness/laboratory confirmed influenza compared with education; hand sanitizer alone resulted in no reduction in this aggregated outcome.‚Äù Again, this is from the link YOU posted, not a libtard propaganda site. Due to your source citing sources that negate his argument twice in a row, I‚Äôm going to disregard the rest of his findings to save us all some time. 
2. Next you cite a ‚Äòmajor article‚Äô by John Hardie (some sort of Canadian dental specialist) - very difficult to find any information about him or his credentials (first red flag). Also, how does once being on a Canadian Dental website make it a major article? Please explain. The first thing I found about him (after multiple search combinations) was the CDA essentially calling him a crackpot. I finally found that he was involved in a 1990 case about a dentist giving 5 of his patients HIV. From 1980-1990 Hardie was the head of the Dentistry department of Ottawa Civic Hospital. Why you think this could make him an expert on the efficacy of masks is beyond me. To give you credit, you did find a ‚Äòmedical professional‚Äô (using the term loosely) to verify that masks are ineffective. Apparently later in his career he did get a degree in an anatomic pathology as well as some other degrees from the royal college of Dentists of Canada (even one pertaining to infections!) so at least he‚Äôs not just a regular dentist. Personally, I‚Äôd trust someone from an Ivy League school but hey, if you think the royal college of dentists of Canada is good enough to risk thousands of lives or more (if no mask mandates were ever put in place), then I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôll ever see eye to eye. Who else here thinks the Royal College of Dentists of Canada is better than Duke university? The thing is, there‚Äôs hundreds of other medical professionals in the field of actual medicine who say masks are effective to varying degrees. Why should we believe your fancy Canadian dentist over so many real doctors? Please refute this point. Please make it make sense, although you may have blocked me by now since I don‚Äôt agree with you. As far as it‚Äôs content, this paper is about how dentists don‚Äôt get a benefit from wearing masks with their patients and written years before Covid-19 emerged. It doesn‚Äôt apply to the general public. Either way, your guy makes an argument and doesn‚Äôt contradict himself, so bravo. Your dentist did not conduct his own studies about masks but hey he did write a really long paper that got deleted. I‚Äôll still go with real doctors and epidemiologists over a dentist, but that‚Äôs just me.
3. Your third entry had multiple sources. Looking at it, I was not excited to dig into the past of every one of them to verify their credentials but I want to make sure you understand why you feel the way you feel. Reasonable people don‚Äôt want to take the time to refute this collection of questionable sources you‚Äôve gathered because it takes time and they just trust the majority of medical professionals instead of the one guy in the corner screaming about climate change or whatever the next hot topic is. The first name in your third source is Michael Klompas, MD. An actual doctor! On top of that an infectious disease specialist. Kudos for finally having someone here that belongs on the list. Next guy is also legit - Charles Morris graduated - real doctor that graduated from Princeton. Next, Julia Sinclair is a little less legit with a couple of Canadian degrees and an MBA from Boston U (which isn‚Äôt relevant to a medicine paper but at least an American U). The next person, Madelyn Pearson is a high ranking nurse. The final person on your source is Erica Shenoy. She is also very legit. She is an AP of Medicine at Harvard Med school as well as the medical director of a pathogens treatment center amongst other qualifications. This reference is legit, but did you really read it? This reference that YOU cited acknowledges masks do make a difference in the spread of the disease. Granted they do say in this paper that the efficacy is minimal but they acknowledge masks do work to some small degree. They state that the risk of getting Covid-19 in passing in an open space is minimal, not zero, so the risk still there. So even if masks stopped 1% of virus spread (the doctors never give an exact percentage) that‚Äôs 6,000 plus lives that have been saved. 6,000 lives isn‚Äôt much compared to our population but what if that 6,000 included your family or friends? How would you feel then? Personally I couldn‚Äôt live with myself knowing I was so selfish to not wear a mask that I got 6,000 people killed but maybe you are more ok with the passive spread of a potentially deadly virus so you don‚Äôt have to wear something? Still to give you credit, they do seem to not believe mask wearing does much, but even if it does anything, it saves lives and that should be good enough for all of us.
4. Your fourth reference also had multiple sources who all seem to be Australian medical professionals to varying degrees. As this is a short article and easy to refute I won‚Äôt bother examining their credentials. Let‚Äôs just cite my favorite part from your article ‚ÄúA meta‚Äêanalysis of randomised controlled trials of pre‚ÄêCOVID‚Äê19 showed that surgical masks or N95 respirators reduced clinical respiratory illness in health‚Äêcare workers by 41% and influenza‚Äêlike illness by 66%: they work but are far from perfect.‚Äù Dude, this is directly from your source and the article was about 3 pages long. How could you miss this? You seem to be actually disproving your own point the deeper in I go so thank you for saving me some work.
5. Your next reference is another Australian paper. I‚Äôll assume your sources are medical professionals and move on to the content. In the results section it says ‚ÄúPenetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.‚Äù You wrote that this article stated that cloth masks may increase transmission. It seems that this article says cloth masks still stop 3% and that medical masks stop more than half of the particles, so not sure how you got there. Less particles, less disease. Again thanks for posting  something that actually tells us masks do work. Nobody said they work 100% of the time. Masks are there to bring the numbers down, which they do, according to your references. I do agree though cloth asks should only be used in emergencies as they are the least effective kind of masks, but they still reduce a small amount of transmission.
6. Your sixth reference is about Covid censorship by the disgraced Canadian Physics professor from the first source you cited. This link is basically your guy complaining that his first article was censored - it‚Äôs most likely because of the contradictory work in his writing that a non-medical professional like me was able to find in under an hour. We‚Äôve already categorically disproved a good portion of his article with his own references so not sure what the value of you posting this is, as again we‚Äôve proven his work is filled with contradictions. Maybe he can give me an A+ for my research?

<li>
<p>Your last source in this section is again complaining about censorship. These articles are censored because they have contradictions in them or are written by people who are unqualified. If lives are at stake, I‚Äôm going to agree with the censorship. Think about it like this, if there‚Äôs no fire in a crowded theater, should we let a guy scream ‚ÄòFIRE!‚Äô and cause a stampede that can kill or maim people? Or should we censor him? Hmmmm‚Ä¶ Do you really think people should die to protect the right of unprofessional people to post misinformation? If that‚Äôs your position, please let me know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your first source here is about the CDC recommending cloth masks. You focus on cloth masks here which we know are must less effective than the other kinds. The studies they actually cite are about overall mask use here. What is your summary fixated on the cloth mask part? The studies state that masks are effective, so thanks for sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>Your final article was already cited above, did you not realize you posted the same article twice? Doesn‚Äôt speak well for your credibility in giving out information that people‚Äôs lives may depend on.
I am being a dick here, but I‚Äôm also stating facts. Please refute my facts. Please prove me wrong and win me over. I do respect facts and listen to them and so far you haven‚Äôt supplied anything close to a strong argument that masks are ineffective. Please advise. Good bot?</li>

        <p>Don't get me wrong, I agree with many of your points. Your post is well-written and concise. But, I don't think you should be a part of this community. It goes deeper than just masks. It's my business because of the same reasons I'm fighting against this new era of government control: I'm a father and I want my children to have a good future. I don't want people like you around them.   </p>
<p>I'm specifically alarmed that you don't deny being a pedophile or seem to think that this sort of deviant behavior is acceptable. It isn't. Its abnormal and falls under crimes against nature.  Honestly, I think your time and energy should be spent getting some professional help, for your own sake and future.</p>

But one thing I've definitely seen everywhere is the person who shouts, "Let's ignore the substance of this person's points and focus on some personal shit I find gross! If we throw them under the bus, maybe we'll look better to the people who are already prejudiced against us!"
