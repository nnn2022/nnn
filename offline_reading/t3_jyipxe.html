    <strong>At taste of the old world</strong>
    <p><p>I walked into the restaurant where I work today and the host wasn't wearing a mask, not even under his chin, because no customers were there.</p>
<p>It made me so happy, to see someone's face instead of a mask. Walking around seeing everybody in masks makes me feel low-key depressed so it was such a nice change.</p>
<p>Of course our manager told us a few minutes later to mask up, so the moment was fleeting. It was short, but euphoric in a way that's hard to describe, almost nostalgic.</p>
<p>Anyone have similar experiences?</p></p>

        <p>I visit shops that defy mandatory masking and pay in cash. There was an instance where the waitress asked for masks although they knew me and of course I left. No point having gourmet with synthetics and risking your history (as when they ask for masks most likely they trace you).</p>

        <p>Yup where I work it's the same thing, sometimes no one wears them at all before we open and it feels so at home again. Then as soon as that clock hits opening time, it's over. I haven't been to a restaurant since it all got put into place and won't go until it's not a thing anymore. I don't care if I just need it to get in or walk around, not playing the game. There are a couple places I really miss.</p>

        <p>I feel similarly, although I usually just suck it up and wear it. Especially when I'm craving a chipotle. There's just too many places that require masks for me to boycott :-(</p>
<p>When I'm feeling ballsy and try not wearing a mask I get called out about 50% of the time. I hate the confrontation so I usually just resort to wearing it.</p>
<p>Looking forward to when more business scrub the mandate, then I'll choose to patron those over others.</p>

        <p>I'm good at cooking at home and only got take out a few times and never wore it picking the stuff up. I never get called out for not wearing it and if I did would just laugh it off and keep going. Almost nowhere is actually enforcing it now though, I was just in a packed Shoprite today and got nothing for not wearing it.</p>

        <p>You been to a trader joe's or a whole foods? They're super strict about it there. I got called out twice within 5 minutes of walking around in there</p>

        <p>Nope haven't been to either of those though in a long time cause they're kinda out of the way. I would be interested in going to Whole Foods sometimes cause they might have some interesting stuff other stores don't. Did they let you shop at all in Whole Foods?</p>

        <p>Yep, there are a couple restaurants near me that don’t wear masks or require them. They are also supposed to be shut down right now because of the governors orders but refused. There is a also a locally owned gas station in my town that doesn’t have employees wear them either.</p>
