        <p>Yup that was me in April 2018 when I got hom from the hospital after my Brain Biopsy.   I am an Influenza Long Hauler...pretty much everything listed as a possible COVID Longhauler has  have been living with for over 3 years now.  </p>
<p>After Surgury.</p>
<p>Surgeon: "You will get answers!"<br>
Me: "You know what is wrong!!"<br>
Surgeon: "Nope!  But it came out the wrong colour, so you will get some answers!"</p>
<p>I am Immunocompromised and nearly died due to complications with Influenza back in 2018.</p>
<p>It was Valentines Day and I had several Seizures and 2(YES 2 STOKES).  </p>
<p>Turned out after YEARS of complaints and being ignored it took a near death experience to get the diagnosis.  </p>
<p>I have Primary Central Nervous System Vasculitis.  My Immune system over reacts and attacks the blood vessels in my brain causing inflamation.  I am told I have to go the ER if I get as much as a Fever!!!  Average life span after diagnosis is 10 years!  I am starting on year 4 now. over a year of my remaining life has been under these restrictions and lockdowns.  </p>
<p>So this means things like the Common Flu or Common Cold can be the trigger and flare my disorder and that could be it for me.  </p>
<p>My Rheumatologist advised me after I was done Chemotherapy in 2018 (Had to kill off part of my immune system - people always think cancer when I saw Chemo) that there was NO REASON TO WEAR A MASK!  </p>
<p>I had just finished Chemo and my Immune system was incredibly weak and I was told in no uncertain terms that a Masks would do nothing for me.  I know I am preaching to choir here as you all know the various reasons why.  </p>
<p>I have made changes to MY LIFE to match my Health Condition.  I hate being treated differently because of my disability.  I have a disability, I do not identify as disabled.  </p>
<p>I do not go out unless I feel up to it.  </p>
<p>I do not have friends over unless I feel up to it. (which we have had almost every weekend despite not legally being allowed to peacefully gather in our own homes here in Alberta Canada).    </p>
<p>I do not need any of you to do anything for me!!  Yet I have people telling me I am to sick to even go out!!  </p>
<p>I am also mask exempt due to that Disorder.  I wear a mask for to long my entire face starts getting the pins and needles sensation and goes numb like when your Foot "falls asleep" and start to "wake up".  Imagine that on your Face for any length of time!!  Then try to talk.  Those Face shields they make people wear at Costo lands right on top of my brain surgury scar...still not pleasant.  </p>
<p>And I also can not get the Vaccine for it is to high a risk that I will react.  I have already "WON" the Genetic Lottery with a 1 in a Million Immune disorder and nearly died.    </p>
<p>Love you all fighting the Good fight.<br>
Keep it up!</p>
