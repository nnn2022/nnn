    <strong>Media Brainwashing</strong>
    <p><p>The media is whipping up mass hysteria 24/7 and keeping this thing going. If it weren't for the media, we would have been done with this fake pandemic along time ago... if theq Mainstream media came out tommorow and said this "pandemic" was over, people would go right back to living life normally, no questions asked. It's sad that too many people rely on the media for info and refuse to do their own research.
If CNN says there's a deadly virus, then it must be true. If just one major news outlet would stop fearmongering, more people would be open to logic and reason. Nobody is able to think outside the box anymore.. It's either (Government/Media) Anything other then that is all just Conspiracy theory </p>
<p>I just feel like giving up trying to wake people up; When do we just call it quits?</p></p>

        <p>See, the problem is the tv. But have a conversation with someone about how tv is brainwashing the public and causing undue hysteria and panic and they will a lot of the time give maybe a chuckle and be like yeah totally...</p>
<p>But... there is very litt late e chance youre gunna convince a tv addicted public to switch off...or at least to stop watching the 'news' (ie. The covid pandemic and vaccine show, with sports and weather.... repeat)...</p>

        <p>I remember walking into someone's house about 7 years ago and they had CNN on the TV. It was right before the election and when they referred to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats they used the word "we".</p>
<p>It had been quite a while since I'd seen CNN but I was shocked at how blatant they had become. I can't imagine how bad it is now.</p>
<p>In 2013 they ended the law preventing the CIA from participating with the media. The US government spent around $7 trillion last year. I'm sure a few billion was thrown to CNN to create propaganda.</p>
<p>Last month they set aside several million to promote the vaccine and stop the spread of "misinformation".<br>
They will be stepping it up. Stop watching the CIA messaging services.</p>
