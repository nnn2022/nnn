    <strong>They call everyone an anti-vaxxer and conspiracy theorist who questions any of it!</strong>
    <p><p>Just got told off on a blog, where I was formerly friendly with. </p>
<p>I wear the masks due to personal high risk, believe the virus is real [though PCR is negotiable] but got told off for discussing the side effects from the vaccine. None of these people want to know. Some woman even boasted of getting the J&amp;J vaccine. I talked about the concerning side effects and even shared personal experiences with people I know and supposedly it's all ancedotes! And they are meaningless and it's only a "teeny" part of the population. They have rendered the word "Anti-vaxx" into meaninglessness, and call everything a conspiracy that is not a mainstream belief. These people are scary. :( Well I am not going to argue with them anymore. I think we are screwed. I guess whatever pans out is going to pan out.</p></p>

        <p>Yup. That pretty much sums it up. Even reasonable normally thinking people are buying into the doom propaganda. </p>
<p>I feel like shouting to all my family "you are taking a RUSHED EXPERIMENTAL drug" but it won't do any good. </p>
<p>They are using reasoning like "its to protect my kids". Dude your kids are almost immune to it already.</p>
<p>I mean FFS three of my four kids got it and they had a headache and slight fever for less than 24 hours. We gave them one dose of ibuprofen for their headache. Their fever was a max of 101.</p>
