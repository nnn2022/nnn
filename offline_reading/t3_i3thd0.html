    <strong>My dad is being shunned on his birthday because he might have the rona</strong>
    <p><p>Today is my dad's birthday. I called him to say happy birthday, took a few tries to get ahold of him, but he finally answered the phone maybe an hour ago. And he sounded depressed. Or tired. Or....sick. Said he had a tickle in his throat that moved down into his chest. So now he's spending his birthday - plus the next few weeks - in a hotel alone instead of with friends or family.</p>
<p>His parents won't let him come home until he gets a COVID test and quarantines for 2 weeks, so I guess he can't just lie and say he tested negative. His friends of 30+ years are treating him "like a leper" and he's questioning their friendship. My mom offered to let him stay with her; if it wasn't for my mother-in-law, my husband and I would let him stay here with us. Unfortunately, I doubt he'll take my mom up on her offer. While he's questioning the mass hysteria, and strongly opposed to the COVID control measures, he still can't shake the fear of the virus. He's dyslexic and not very tech-savvy, so he really relies on others for news. The news is doing its job terribly well.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I'm absolutely livid. Sorry if my behavior makes us look bad, but I will not lie, I stabbed a cardboard box with a shovel while shouting expletives. My husband found it rather amusing. I too would find it amusing, but all I currently feel is rage and sadness. No one should spend their birthday or a holiday - or any day, for that matter - completely alone against their will because of what basically amounts to a new cold. Don't get me wrong, my dad is an introvert who values his alone time, but he's obviously hurt by how his family and friends are treating him. Many of these friends once stood beside him, brothers in arms, running into burning buildings together. So they can take the heat, but they can't take the cold?</p>
<p>And yeah, I'm a bit worried that my dad is sick. He doesn't get sick very often, but when he does, it hits him hard. Whether it be a cold, the flu, or a hangover. He shouldn't be alone right now, someone should be taking care of him. He was with his parents last night, so they've probably already been exposed, they're just being selfish ignorant cowards by shunning their son. And my dad doesn't want to involve my mom in any of this bullshit, plus they live in different states.</p>
<p>Sadly, this situation.is quite common nowadays. My mother-in-law's best friend's grandma had her 100th birthday back in March, but the party got cancelled because COVID. She died a few weeks later. If she got the rona, yeah she could've died, but she died anyway because she was old. And while she claimed to be okay with being cooped up inside alone on her birthday, maybe boredom and loneliness is what pushed her over the edge. It happens. Everyone "PrOtEcTiNg GrAnDmA" seems to ignore the high rates of suicidal ideation in the elderly. I wonder fucking why?</p>
<p>I want to either cry or fight. Figuratively speaking, of course.</p></p>

        <p>I'm really, really sorry to hear you're going through this. And sorry to your dad. This is really fucked up.</p>
<p>You're a good daughter.</p>
<p>"  I stabbed a cardboard box with a shovel while shouting expletives. "</p>
<p>I've punched stuff, screamed "YOU'RE ALL FUCKING SHEEP!" randomly in public, punched trash bins in the city, etc. These are insane circumstances and people are being absolutely evil to each other - of course that's going to cause you a lot of pain and frustration. Stabbing a cardboard box is a decent release of your pent-up emotions. Don't beat yourself up over it. But I'm sorry you have to feel like this in the first place.</p>
<p>Stay strong. You are NOT alone, and neither is your dad. Maybe once more people post here and give support, show this thread to your dad so he knows he's not alone too?</p>

        <p>Thank you so much! :)</p>
<p>I know stabbing a cardboard box isn't really a big deal, but I could see our naysayers holding such acts of emotion against us. I wish I had the courage to speak out in public like you do; most I can muster is a few comments under my breath, or maybe some "jokes" about social distancing signs. Turns out people get my jokes more often than I expect.</p>
<p>Not sure how I can show my dad this post though, not until I see him again in a few weeks. :/ He doesn't really text or use internet.</p>

        <p>You'd be surprised how much tiny little jokes, or little comments here and there, make a difference. I've been surprised how many people open up when I just drop a little joke, and they end up saying things like, "I really hate these masks" or "I think the government is lying to us."</p>
<p>Every tiny little comment/joke helps. That said - your sanity/safety/health comes first. Don't stress yourself out more than you have to; not everyone has to be an "activist".</p>

        <p>I’m sorry your going through this. Stories like this break my heart. And it is happening all over. These promask/pro lock down folks “care” so much about saving “grandmas” but don’t give two f*cks about social isolation of the young and old what it does to their mental state. They don’t care about rising suicide rates, rising addictions, adults and children trapped in a house with an abuser, etc.
Please hang in there and your not alone. We will get through this.</p>

        <p>Can't, at least no more readily than he can come stay with my mom. We live in different states, I don't drive, and I'm not sure if my husband knows how to get where exactly we'd be going. Otherwise we would, especially since my dad said he wouldn't rat us out to the contact tracers. I trust and respect him more than almost anyone else I know.</p>

<p>We don't want an apology, your story is valuable as it goes atop the mounting, ranging episodes occurring all over the globe that are like it. I for one welcome people's venting anywhere. These experiences should not be forgotten nor forgiven when gov/media complex try to enact this garbage again in the future or think they should extend it.  </p>
<p>If you're dad is in Texas &amp; near me <em>I'll</em> go visit him, I don't care. If you want to arrange it, I'll spot for a cake/food that the hotel offers. Send him my regards. Happy Birthday for whatever it's worth.</p>
