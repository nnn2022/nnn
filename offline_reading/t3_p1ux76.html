    <strong>How Plato can help you make sense of this vaccine situation.</strong>
    <p><p>It's no secret that Plato didn't like democracy, nor that Socrates was killed with a vote.</p>
<p>To Plato, there was no escaping an immaterial part of reality, which is what he referred to as "the forms." The concepts of virtue, justice, courage, etc, were not only categories in the mind, they were ontologically real <em>beings</em>, <em>with causal power;</em> They guide your actions.</p>
<p>These forms were organized in a hierarchy; some societies would worship the god of war, or the god of technology, Zues, Pan, Dionysus, etc; each society had a place for each form, but placed in a different order.</p>
<p>The problem with this though, is that you can have conflict  when people have different highest Gods, different categories they see the world through. For example, someone who values reason over emotions talking to someone who values emotions over reason is going to have a hard time living together. Without a unifying principle society fragments.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and we can see these same principles playing out. Some of the country has notions of knowledge that are immovable (trust the science), and some are more skeptical of the institutions. Well, how do you reconcile that?</p>
<p>Some people have a utilitarian-pain-avoidance metaethic, while others value liberty over pain avoidance and don't want the vaccine. Well, how do you reconcile that?</p>
<p>We are witnessing what happens when categories/gods clash. Personally, I think a society that values safety over everything is already too far gone. That means there's nothing worth dying for to them. They're literally willing to be under a paternalist tyranny.</p></p>

        <p>Living in UTMOST safety is not living.</p>
<p>Look at the disparity of protection in sports:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>full gear in american football (because of the helmet), some with high tech helmets that monitor concussion physics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No pads in rugby (need less pads b/c you have to wrap up &amp; go down w/ opponent with tackling)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Australian football league: nearly anything goes, no pads. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>People have died in all 3 roughly similar sports. </p>
<p>There is risk of playing. The players know there is a risk. </p>
<p>If the risk was too high, people wouldnt play. </p>
<p>....but do we have people screeching that NO ONE should play because its too dangerous, just because they themselves wont take the risk ?</p>

        <p>There is an inherent risk to living. </p>
<p>Let those that value freedom live how they please. Let those that value safety live how they please. </p>
<p>Both sides just need to respect the other.</p>
