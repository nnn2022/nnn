    <strong>As a COVID vaxxer, I'm hoping you can provide insight to me</strong>
    <p><p>Edit: Sorry all, this blew up way more than expected. I'll try and respond to everyone eventuaoly but I want to thank everyone so far and in the future for participating. I'm sad that not only my post but all my comments were downvoted, but I somewhat expected it. Regardless of your beliefs, I hope you all stay safe and healthy.</p>
<p>So I stumbled upon this subreddit and after reading a few posts, I'm hoping I can ask some questions and receive some answers. Full disclaimer - I believe everyone has the right to make their own decisions. However I do believe this vaccine will save many and that everyone who can get it, should.</p>
<p>1.) Why are you so adamantly against the vaccine? Hundreds of millions of people have had the vaccine without any serious, uncommon for a regular vaccination, adverse effects. Like many drugs, everything has side effects - but the sheer number of  people who have received the vaccine and not had any side effects FAR outweighs those that have had side effects.</p>
<p>2.) If you are just hesitant to get the vaccine due to how new it was and how we don't know longer term effects - how long of a period of time is necessary before you'd feel safe?</p>
<p>3.) I've seen plenty of posts here about individuals who have had side effects or worse due to the vaccine. Almost all of them are followed by comments stating that they shouldn't get GoFundMe's and they should have to pay everything out of pocket because they chose to get the shot. If you're in a country with public Healthcare - are you going to deny medical treatment if you do catch COVID? If these people don't deserve paid healthcare because they received the vaccine, should you no longer qualify for Healthcare because you didn't?</p>
<p>4.) Why are there so many anti-vaxxers or at least anti-COVID vaxxers who are upset or furious when they're denied access to a store? A store is a privately owned entity who can make their own rules and decisions, just as you can. If you have a right to decline to wear a mask, why do you not respect the stores right to decline to serve you? </p>
<p>5.) Why do so many anti-maskers claim ridiculous things such as "wearing a mask is poisonous" or that it "restricts airflow" etc.? How do you explain surgeons doing it their whole career? Some people claim "medical conditions" however I've a friend who has cystic fibrosis who continually has breathing issues but yet has NO issue wearing a mask.</p>
<p>6.) Why do so many of you feel that doing "self research" on echo chambers like Reddit or Google is more qualified than 7+ years of schooling? Why do you trust all the other information your doctors have provided you, or statements science has said, but suddenly their the enemy?</p>
<p>7.) Why would all governments come together to lie to all citizens? In no other circumstance have governments been able to co-operate like this. Why wouldn't Russia or China immediately call the U.S. out as a hoax just to stir up civil movements?</p>
<p>8.) What purpose would the government have for lying? If people truly were getting sick from the vaccine, why did some leaders take it on live television? Why would the government kill off people who pay taxes, providing them more money? Why would pharmaceutical companies kill people off or injure them with COVID when there are so many more profitable diseases like diabetes or cancer?</p>
<p>I truly believe if you do not want the shot you should not be forced to get it. But at the same time, freedom of speech is not synonymous to freedom from consequences. Your choice to not get vaccinated, or not wear a mask, holds consequences. So I don't understand why so many are upset when faced with these consequences.</p>
<p>I'm hoping some people can provide me with some insight here. I assume I may be banned for this post, or be named called, or downvoted to oblivion. That's fine. I just want to try and understand your guys' walk of life.</p>
<p>Edited in questions 7 and 8* also corrected a statement in question 1.</p></p>

<p>I was unaware of this. I just looked it up. From my brief reviewing it appears this IS true, but it's a small number of individuals and even then they make a full recovery. But I do thank you for the information, I definitely need to look further into this.</p>
<p>&rt;2. Probably never.  30 Male, Chance of Death is 0.00007%.  By getting the "vaccine" touting a 95% effectiveness against death, this is a relative risk calculation.  Im reducing my risk from 0.00007% to 0.0000035%.  I'll take my chances. </p>
<p>What about the risk of spreading the disease to the elderly or immunocompromised? You will likely survive but they may not. What if they had 5-10 year data that showed it was safe? Would you then?</p>
<p>&rt;3. Public Healthcare takes care of everyone.  Including the sheep. </p>
<p>100%. I just see a ton of posts here about how people who have symptoms shouldn't be covered so I was curious if you were to catch it if that mindset would be put in place for yourself since you declined the vaccination.</p>
<p>&rt;4. Medical records are private personal information.  Today its no-access due to no "vaccine", tomorrow it could be because of your skin color, or if you're Jewish.  History repeats itself.  It is our responsibility to CONSTANTLY be checking our governments with our fellow countrymen.  </p>
<p>This is just a slippery slope fallacy. There's no evidence this will result in anything worse. This is like saying "well Reddit allowed pedophiles back in the day. Next they'll have a subreddit for rapists and then for serial killers. We should remove Reddit."</p>
<p>I'm not trying to dismiss your argument but it's a know fallacy. </p>
<p>&rt;5. Psychologically damaging I suppose as well. Increased paranoia in children. </p>
<p>I'm sorry, I'm not following. How?</p>
<p>&rt;6. Science is in the hands of Big Pharma.

<p>I edited in questions after thaylt you may not have seen but I believe questions 7 and 8 touch on this.</p>
<p>Edit: thank you for taking the time to respond though. I do appreciate it. Seriously.</p>

<p>Sorry, a very, very large majority of them do. Nothing is for sure. Even with a dresser mounted to a wall, they sometimes fall on children. But we realize the risk of a child being crushed is very slim and rare, so we still use dressers (and unfastened, at that!)</p>
<p>&rt;Also, you didn't address the fact that this vaccine is not FDA approved.</p>
<p>I'm not from the States. I'm confused on this reliance on the FDA approval. They've approved many things in the past that were detrimental for people so I'm unsure why their approval is required for people to feel safe. Is the FDA not the same company which allowed DuPont to completely pollute waterways and our environment because it "wasn't necessary their jurisdiction"?</p>

That in mind, thats why youre seeing sweeping contradictory policy on covid mandates across the globe AND you're seeing top level politicians being "caught" out and about not following their own fucking rules.  </p>

<p>If they can kill off a portion of the population, that leaves food for the rest of us.  Survival of the fittest.  Biggest, strongest, richest, smartest.  Thats all it is.

        <p>&rt;1. Yeah, alarming. Not giving us the full picture. </p>
<p>Definitely worrisome that I needed to look this up to find it - especially since very reputable sites come up supporting it including SickKids hospital. This should be well known. </p>
<p>&rt;2. "risk of spreading" is bullshit propaganda.  The vaccinated are still dying from Covid, AND you can still get covid and transmit covid after being vaccinated.  Begs the question, then HOW effective is it really....?</p>
<p>Vaccines aren't here to stop you from catching something though. They're here to lessen the effects and spread you receive. Obviously it's effectiveness differs from person to person but they're not going to stop someone from catching it. I think the vast majority of people just think if they get a vaccine they won't catch whatever the vaccine is for, but you can still catch it. And unfortunately die from the disease in rare cases too.</p>
<p>&rt;3. Yeah I wish no harm on anyone.  None of this "deny rights bullshit".  I pay taxes for public health so that sick people can use it. </p>
<p>Glad to hear. We're on the same page.</p>
<p>&rt;4. Jews in Nazi Germany.  Started "with no proof".  Defined as inferior (hmm similar..), from there it increased to hate mongering propaganda (antivax), blamed for the depression.

<p>100%. But correlation is not causation. What we're disregarding here is that a political party needed a scapegoat for their hardships and troubles and picked one (simplifying the situation of course). This is no where near the beginning of a holocaust for anti-mask/vaxxers. We're playing with the slippery slope fallacy here.</p>
<p>&rt;5. It's confining. </p>
<p>Yeah, another person has me teetering on mask usage as well.</p>
<p>&rt;7. Humans are very emotional and reactive in modern times.  They go ahead with things before carefully thinking them through. Example: the vaccine.  I was all for it, until I started to hear about myocarditis, then did a bunch of REAL research on it.  And I have too many unanswered questions and have assessed my risks.  That in mind, thats why youre seeing sweeping contradictory policy on covid mandates across the globe AND you're seeing top level politicians being "caught" out and about not following their own fucking rules.<br>
&rt;</p>
<p>Yeah. It doesn't help that politicians are saying "you need to do z for your people" and then go and not do z themselves. I understand that sentiment and frustration. I couldn't go camping for a week but a local member of government went on a week long vacation.</p>
<p>&rt;8. If they can kill off a portion of the population, that leaves food for the rest of us.  Survival of the fittest.  Biggest, strongest, richest, smartest.  Thats all it is.  If Pfizer can compromise the 18-35 population with an unregulated, untested and frankly dangerous vaccine without ANY liability attached, they've literally just created millions of new customers for the next 50 years.</p>
<p>But if this was the case, why not force vaccines? Why not pick something easier which requires less compliance like poisoning water, or hell, actually creating a debilitating disease. Why not create COVID with a higher spread and mortality rate? Or just a higher disability rate?</p>

        <p>Why not force vaccination? Because that's an infringement on personal rights.  You don't need to look at only nazi Germany, look at black slaves in America, similarities. </p>
<p>Correlation and causation is absolutely true when we're talking about humans. You're seeing it now, with people segregating from "anti-vax", forced vaccination to be gainfully employed.  How is that just a moot point? Sure maybe it's not full on Holocaust yet, but to say it's not similar characteristics of segregation in history is dangerously naive.</p>

<p>I'm sorry you feel this way. Imagine if the government said this to you and told you that vaccinations were mandatory or you'd be shot? What a horrible way of thinking and I'm sorry that you're closed-minded.</p>
<p>&rt;out of scope of this sub
&rt;</p>
<p>I fail to see how asking a sub which revolves around not masking and not vaxxing for their opinions is out of scope for said sub. </p>
<p>&rt;&rt; So I don't understand why so many are upset when faced with these consequences.
&rt;
&rt;what consequences are to be brought to bear from not being sick with the common cold? 
&rt;</p>
<p>So I'm sorry you've been under a rock but the common cold does not clog up hospitals, ventilators, and kill as many people as COVID has. I'm sorry you're ignorant towards the disease. I truly believe the media has completely overhyped COVID but it still takes lives.</p>
<p>The consequences of not being permitted to enter stores. I consistently see people complaining they can't enter a store because the store requires masks.</p>
<p>&rt;wtf is wrong with you?
&rt;</p>
<p>Nothing. I'd ask you the same question. Someone comes in here politely trying to understand your viewpoint and you instantly go on the attack and act aggressively towards them. I truly hope you find help for whatever pain it is you feel inside.</p>
<p>&rt;
&rt;go away and stay away</p>
<p>I think I'll stay unless I'm banned. Just as you have the freedom to say no to a shot, I have the freedom to stay on this sub and request more information.</p>
<p>Please, PLEASE, seek help.</p>

<p>I've had reactions to many shots. Shingles, the flu, etc. It's normal for some people to feel some effects since it's literally priming your bodies immune system.</p>

        <p>I have a history of being sick from vaccines so I was aware this was likely to be the case. Many of my coworkers have had the shot with no side effects worse than a sore arm. In my department of 120 people, only two were off for any amount of time (myself included) and the other one was off as they had a minor fever for a day - they felt fine but my workplace sent them home to be safe. </p>
<p>I find it acceptable because there is a small chance I could get COVID. And if I did, I'd be off for far more than 3 days. Luckily mine were paid days but I understand others may not. My side effects? Nausea, a headache, and a fever. And the headache may not have even been linked since I've had chronic  headaches since I was 4. I could have easily worked through it but like I said, the days were paid, so why not take them?</p>

        <p>I never said vaccines were completely safe? All vaccines have side effects. No vaccine is completely 100% safe. I'm asking questions here to better educate myself. How can I sit here and say "I'm correct and you're wrong" when I haven't even heard the oppositions side? Some people have posted stuff here that has me looking things up, second guessing things, and looking for more answers. Other people here have unfortunately taken the standpoint that I'm a moron, and they've done nothing to assist in education. They're "right" simply because their "right", and there's no further discussion for them. 4000 years of studies could be shown to them showing the vaccine has been improved and is now 100% safe and there are zero side effects and those people will still call me a sheep and a moron. </p>
<p>I'm just here to spark conversation and better my understanding.</p>

        <p>There is evidence pointing to the contrary though. There is this series of experiments from 1919 during the Spanish Flu, where they failed to make even one subject sick.</p>
<p>https://sci-hub.se/10.1001/jama.1919.02610310005002</p>
<p>And here is an excerpt from a study looking at post-operative infection differences between masked and no masked surgeons. We know from all the propaganda lab tests that masks stop bacteria but it made no difference.</p>
<p>&rt;It has never been shown that wearing surgical face masks decreases postoperative wound infections. On the contrary, a 50% decrease has been reported after omitting face masks. The present study was designed to reveal any 30% or greater difference in general surgery wound infection rates by using face masks or not. During 115 weeks, a total of 3,088 patients were included in the study. Weeks were denoted as "masked" or "unmasked" according to a random list. After 1,537 operations performed with face masks, 73 (4.7%) wound infections were recorded and, after 1,551 operations performed without face masks, 55 (3.5%) infections occurred. This difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05) and the bacterial species cultured from the wound infections did not differ in any way, which would have supported the fact tha the numerical difference was a statistically "missed" difference. These results indicated that the use of face masks might be reconsidered. Masks may be used to protect the operating team from drops of infected blood and from airborne infections, but have not been proven to protect the patient operated by a healthy operating team.</p>

        <p>... wait what? You want me to find a study which shows two vastly different people having the exact same symptoms upon human to human contact? But lab tests confirming transmission can't be used? Apart from how ridiculous that sounds (Lab tests would confirm it!), I want you to just sit and think for a moment about this question. </p>
<p>How would diseases transfer at all? You're going to argue human to surface to human. But if that's the case then it's no different. If I can sneeze on my hand and transfer a disease to my hand, and then I touch a surface and it passes, then I could sneeze in my hand and touch a person and it'd pass. Don't be ridiculous.</p>

        <p>There’s a spectrum of people here. 
I cannot answer all your questions, 
because first off, I have no problem with the vaccine. I realize some are having bad reactions, however, from what I’m aware, that’s the case with any vaccine or medicine, so why should this one be more perfect?
Having said that, I do not think anyone should be required to get this vaccine. It should be by choice only, same as the flu vaccine. </p>
<p>5) I am strongly opposed to masks. I’ve read different studies that show they are basically useless outside of a sterile setting. Proper mask wearing in public society is a fantasy. The reality is that most people touch their mask, don’t wash their mask, set their masks on contaminated surfaces etc. Because of this, masks are just another filthy germ vehicle.</p>
<p>Surgeons wear the mask to keep bodily fluids, or other debris from splashing onto their face, or to protect against Bacteria. Surgeons wear the mask only during active surgery, not all hours of every workday. and they never touch their mask. If it must be removed, it is discarded and a fresh one will be used.  </p>
<p>In addition to these, masks are psychologically terrible for society. Covering the human face, and expressions, turns people into faceless zombies. Masks also impede verbal communication, especially for people that rely on lip reading. </p>

<p>Yes and no. So I see what you're saying and I agree. People don't do things properly. It takes 1 trip to the grocery store to see people not wearing them properly, exposing their nose, touching their face. That said - they still help. Instead of providing (made up numbers here) 99% effectiveness against spread, they may provide 30%. 30% is better than 0%, no?</p>

<p>Yep. 100% agree. But other than work, when are we faced with wearing a mask for extended periods of time? I know the counter argument is "well we can't dismiss work, it's 8+ hours a day" and I won't pretend I have an argument for that. </p>
<p>&rt;In addition to these, masks are psychologically terrible for society. Covering the human face, and expressions, turns people into faceless zombies. Masks also impede verbal communication, especially for people that rely on lip reading.

<p>I'm not trying to tell you how wrong you are. I'm trying to open my mind and better understand. As you see, I agree with a lot of what you've said. And after your post, I'm even teetering on the fence regarding masks. This is the reason I posted here. So I can be more educated on a topic and can understand where a community is coming from.</p>

        <p>1) I'm not planning to get the vaccine for five reasons: </p>
<p>a)Lack of long term safety data.</p>
<p>b) Reports to VAERS are horrific, and this is the tip of the iceberg. I've also seen lots of people I know personally get horrible side effects from the vaccines.</p>
<p>c) MRNA vaccines have never received full approval, nor have coronavirus vaccines. There are complex reasons for that, but it's not a good sign.</p>
<p>d) I'm at statistically zero risk for Covid, so the only reason I'd get the vaccine is to avoid transmitting it. Since the vaccine makers admit there is zero evidence the vaccines will do that, there's no reason for me to take it even if the risks are close to zero.</p>
<p>e) I don't trust pharmaceutical companies. </p>
<p>2) At a minimum, the usual period of time for trials to gather data for full approval, which in this case won't be done until 2023. Even then, I'd be cautious, given how often things which receive approval are still dangerous.</p>
<p>3) I think the people saying that anyone who has an adverse reaction the vax shouldn't get help are dicks. That's actually a fairly common position here.</p>
<p>4) Where I am, stores do not have the option to choose whether to make patrons wear a mask. It's legally mandated that they do, and that's what I take issue with. If a private company chooses to tell me I need to wear a mask, I won't go in. I'll still complain about it, given point #5 though.</p>
<p>5) How does a mask protect against Covid if it doesn't restrict airflow? I don't see how, which means either they restrict airflow or they don't work, in which case it's theatre. </p>
<p>6) If you read this subreddit, you'll find we quite often cite scientific papers. And I haven't bothered with a doctor in years, because I don't trust the pharmaceutical industry. It's not that I believe I know more than the "experts", but I don't trust people who will benefit financially from saying certain things to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Between the human capacities for self deception and willingness to lie, if someone has enough money and wants to find people who will parrot whatever line they want them to, it's easy to do. Given how much money flows from the pharmaceutical industry to the regulators, doctors, medical researchers, and media, I think it's safe to say that a lot of the experts are saying what they do to make money, not because of any kind of evidence, scientific or otherwise.</p>
<p>7) Read RT sometime: The Russians are using their English language media to argue that lockdowns are terrible. I wouldn't be surprised if the Russians or Chinese were secretly funding a lot of the anti-lockdown movements, but they won't do so publicly. The risks are too high, and they can easily do it without anyone, even the people they're funding, knowing they're doing it.</p>
<p>8) Keep in mind that a lot of people are genuinely deathly terrified of Covid, and will happily take quite substantial risks to avoid it. I don't think that most people grasp just how often human beings can go completely off the rails, and this is what's happening here.</p>

        <p>I was waiting for FDA approval.  If the vaccines are such a bastion of medical safety then there should be no waiver of accountability for the vax manufacturers, and the FDA approval process should be fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>But <em>now</em> I will not take the vaccine while there are movements trying to force vax passports.  I won't be part of that nonsense.  The glee and hope for death and disenfranchisement of the unvaccinated is a sickness into itself among the pro-vax demographics.</p>
<p>I wore a mask out of courtesy and respect for property rights.  Those questions don't apply to me.</p>
<p>Gov'ts lie all the time, even when there is no compelling reason to do so.  But in this case there are historical amounts of funds, political power, and other resources being pushed around the gameboard.  Reasons for gov'ts to lie here are legion and our leaders have changed their stories many times already.  Any expectation of truthfulness or altruism from our leaders is foolish.</p>
<p>And the science isn't "settled".  The efficacy of various treatments, likely origins of cv19, etc have been subject to revision.  A lot of times your beloved scientists are wrong or just don't know.  And science is deliberately adversarial - science should always be subject to scrutiny.</p>

        <p>I worked in medical research for a while; I think a lot of things were not worth the risks before, but also that a lot was, but now? No way in hell am I taking anything approved post 2020. The rules which prevented the most egregious things from being approved are gone, so the risk benefit calculations are no longer remotely comparable.</p>

        <p>1.)  I'm against coercion to take experimental medicine, especially (but not exclusively) when the disease it prevents bears little risk to the general population.  I'm all for people assessing their own risk and taking the vaccine if they'd like, but the push to get everyone to take it before long-term trials complete is irresponsible.  Forcing children to take it is obscene.</p>
<p>2.)  At least 3-4 years.  That's how long it usually takes before lingering effects are considered "long-term", and how long new drug trials are supposed to last to find them.</p>
<p>3.)  I haven't heard that one, and I don't think it represents this sub.  However, it is a problem that vaccine makers have been granted immunity from liability.  Ideally they should be on the hook for adverse effects rather than the victims and taxpayers.</p>
<p>4.)  Discrimination is wrong.  Your "it's a private business" argument supports numerous atrocities, such as separate drinking fountains by race.  What do you think about gay people buying wedding cakes?</p>
<p>5.)  Surgeons wear a fresh sterilized mask for a short period, then throw it away.  If everyone used surgical masks the way they were intended, trashed masks would be even more of an environmental disaster than they already are.  Instead people reuse masks for days as they fester with bacteria.  You're more likely to infect your lungs with that bacteria than keep a respiratory virus out.</p>
<p>6.)  We listen to the <em>actual</em> experts, like <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dancing-naked-in-the-mind-field-kary-mullis/1100271007">Nobel Prize winner Kary Mullis who invented the PCR test.</a>  He's far more credible than bureaucrats like Fauci who are shoved into the spotlight because they'll say what they're supposed to say.</p>
<p>7.)  Some had opportunistic goals like election meddling, but in my opinion most of this bad leadership can be explained by Hanlon's razer: stupid, not evil.</p>
<p>8.)  Follow the money.  Hundreds of billions are at stake.  Trump is partially to blame for the promises he made to pharmaceutical companies that enabled the rushed vaccine development: immunity from liability and an emergency use authorization.  To justify the EUA, the viability of existing treatments like Ivermectin and HCQ had to be suppressed by the FDA and CDC.  I don't believe this is some sort of depopulation conspiracy (though I have heard that one here) but a simple monetary one.</p>

        <p>&rt;1.) Why are you so adamantly against the vaccine?</p>
<p>Because the events of the past year have made me distrustful of it.  Right from the beginning of things last April I predicted this was going to end with "as mandatory as possible" vaccinations and the demonization of people who didnt want to take it as "dangerous conspiracy nuts".</p>
<p>And so now here we are. Things have gone pretty much exactly how my "tinfoil hat" predictions laid out. And the vaccine is being pushed on me and I'm not supposed to feel weird about that?</p>
<p>&rt;If you're in a country with public Healthcare - are you going to deny medical treatment if you do catch COVID? If these people don't deserve paid healthcare because they received the vaccine, should you no longer qualify for Healthcare because you didn't?</p>
<p>There are people on both sides who argue like this. As far as I am concerned, I live in a country with socialized medicine so the fact that I pay taxes means 2 things: I get to go to the hospital, no matter what. (Even if I injured myself out of stupidity.) And also, I have "fulfilled my duty" to my fellow Canadians by helping to pay for the care that covid patients receive. I have "done my part".</p>
<p>&rt;4.) Why are there so many anti-vaxxers or at least anti-COVID vaxxers who are upset or furious when they're denied access to a store?</p>
<p>I'm actually pretty libertarian on this and I think that stores can do what they want, even if I dont like it or think it's stupid. (Including not baking gay cakes if they dont want to)</p>
<p>&rt;6.) Why do so many of you feel that doing "self research" on echo chambers like Reddit or Google is more qualified than 7+ years of schooling? </p>
<p>Ask the esteemed doctors and scientists on our side (the ones that are being slandered and silenced in a really weird extreme way) why they agree with us? </p>
<p>Science is political. You are exposed to "The Science" that makes it through the media and political filters.  Science relies on government funding. Think about the ramifications of that. </p>
<p>&rt;8.) What purpose would the government have for lying? If people truly were getting sick from the vaccine, why did some leaders take it on live television?</p>
<p>It's complicated, but I think we are witnessing a kind of "soft takeover" of the world by GloboCorp. They have an agenda (GreatReset, 4th Industrial Revolution) that they have "sold" to the nations of the world. I think the whole package (vaccines/vaccinePass/digitalID/digitalCurrency/etc) has been presented, and a vision of a future has been presented, and now the nations that have signed up for that are following a "plan".</p>

        <p>The CDC admits only 90 to 95 percent of covid deaths have 1 to 3 additional morbilities (other reasons for death). The vaccine was never tested, it is an experimental drug.  Why would I take an experimental vaccine that has less of a fatality rate than the flu? </p>

<li>
<p>i’m against it for the very reason that there are no long term studies. the 8 or so months it took to develop this is damn near criminal. additionally, i’m not sold on the new “tech” being used (as in spike proteins, not microchips)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>depends. i’m not an expert on the matter, i only know it hasn’t been long enough yet. you have to consider that this is not only a new vax, but, again, a new TYPE of vax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i believe people should be compensated for vax injury myself, in the form of some sort of penalty towards the manufacturers. at the moment, they aren’t being held liable, which is bs to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this one is about even application of the law. there ARE laws against medical discrimination (you can’t discriminate against someone with HIV for having it). why is covid any different?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is more about good practice. the problem is bacteria: wearing the same mask all day long, day after day just isn’t healthy, but most people do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>agendas, man. those “scientists” are usually being paid to say what they say. common sense is worth a lot more than people think, and common people aren’t stupid. we can make our own calls.</p>

&rt;1. i’m against it for the very reason that there are no long term studies. the 8 or so months it took to develop this is damn near criminal. additionally, i’m not sold on the new “tech” being used (as in spike proteins, not microchips)</p>
<p>Fair enough. I respect this.</p>
<p>&rt;2. depends. i’m not an expert on the matter, i only know it hasn’t been long enough yet. you have to consider that this is not only a new vax, but, again, a new TYPE of vax.</p>
<p>Would you be more open to this "Novavax" I've recently learned of from this sub?</p>
<p>&rt;3. i believe people should be compensated for vax injury myself, in the form of some sort of penalty towards the manufacturers. at the moment, they aren’t being held liable, which is bs to me.</p>
<p>Again, fair enough.</p>
<p>&rt;4. this one is about even application of the law. there ARE laws against medical discrimination (you can’t discriminate against someone with HIV for having it). why is covid any different?</p>
<p>So here's my issue - the store has rights too. They have the right to serve who they wish. Stores (for the most part) aren't saying you can't attend, they're saying you need to attend with a mask. So while they can't say "we refuse to serve you because you don't have your vaccine", they can say "we respect your right to choose, and we ask you respect ours. We ask that you wear a mask while indoors". </p>
<p>&rt;5. this is more about good practice. the problem is bacteria: wearing the same mask all day long, day after day just isn’t healthy, but most people do that.</p>
<p>Yeah. This sub has me iffy on masks after this post.</p>
<p>&rt;6. agendas, man. those “scientists” are usually being paid to say what they say. common sense is worth a lot more than people think, and common people aren’t stupid. we can make our own calls.</p>
<p>I'm just confused why majority would agree. Who's paying them? The government? Why would all governments work together for once? Why is no one throwing any other government under the bus? Is big pharma paying them? Why? How do they benefit from harming their clientele?</p>

        <p>i’d be interested in nonavax if i was a part of the risk group for covid, and i definitely feel better about it as a vax since it’s more traditional.</p>
<p>i am all for store rights, but the problem is that they aren’t applied evenly.</p>
<p>gov may not be paying the scientists, but big pharma certainly is, and big pharma has an agenda: make money. they’re going to say whatever makes them the most.</p>

<p>Right... yeah COVID is a hoax... I actually know people who have caught it but okay.</p>
<p>&rt;2. I will never get it now on principle.  Could be proven safe 25 years from now fuck no I’m not taking it then either.</p>
<p>Okay? Makes no sense to me but alright.</p>
<p>&rt;3. Loaded &amp; poorly written question, skip.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>&rt;4. Because it’s alright to put a gun to the head of a baker to make a cake for degenerate homosexuals but I can’t go somewhere unless I have a vaccination.  Fuck that.  My body, my choice.</p>
<p>Never once saw a baker with a gun to their head. Gotta love the hate though. I love how it's "my body, my choice" when you want to refer to you and the vaccine. But those gays better not be playing hide the sausage! Wouldn't it be their bodies, their choice? </p>
<p>&rt;5. Enjoy your muzzle.</p>
<p>Weird. It's almost as if it doesn't restrict me at all.</p>
<p>&rt;6. Hack doctors on television have contradicted themselves and doubled back for 18 months straight lying to the public and silencing dissent, but trust them?  Get fucked.</p>
<p>Uh maybe stop listening to the doctors on TV then if you don't trust them? There's plenty of family doctors or non-televised doctors who state the same thing. Let's also remember that we haven't had a pandemic in decades... so this is new. Things wl change as situations change.</p>
<p>&rt;7.  Because people are evil and corrupt.</p>
<p>Sorry you feel that way. Doesn't really answer the question.</p>
<p>&rt;8. Control</p>
<p>Yeah that just makes no sense.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to respond. At first I thought you were just a conspiracy theorist but then I saw your post history. I hope you find help. You're homophobic, racist, and a denier of things which you don't even need a scientist to see (Global warming, COVID). I'd go further in your history but seeing your hate speech against blacks is disgusting. Please, for the sake of everyone around you, seek mental help.</p>
