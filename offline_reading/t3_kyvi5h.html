<title>A peer-reviewed Stanford study found no statistical evidence that lockdowns result in reduced daily growth of COVID cases when compared with more voluntary measures among 10 countries. A small reduction in growth of daily cases is possible but not found, whereas a significant reduction is ruled out.</title>

        <p>This survey was done before the initial lockdowns, and it is also taking the population as a whole (pointed out in the abstract) so this shouldn’t be used as reasoning to attend parties. It’s also good to point out that most of these countries are using a free healthcare system, so more people got tested and then knew if they were unsafe to continue going outside</p>
