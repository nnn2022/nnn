<title>(Yes I got the vaccine, but I will respect your decision to not get one as long as you respect mine that I got one) my main question is, are there really people here who believe that people are putting microchips in the vaccines?</title>

        <p>Ok I can respect that. But to that I have to ask, why would they go through the effort of putting that in our bloodstream to track us if they could just track us through our electronics and credit/debit card purchases? I'm not trying to be rude I genuinely want to know</p>

        <p>Right on Moderna’s website, they compare the technology to an operating system on a computer. Exactly what all that could be used for, I’m not going to pretend to know. https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/mrna-platform-enabling-drug-discovery-development</p>

        <p>There are absolutely people here that believe that. First of all, that is totally fine if people believe that, the real question would be is, why is it such a big deal if people do? And also ask yourself the question of, why such a seemingly complicated issue, has been broken down to seem totally “nutty and whacked out”.  it is really important to understand that that statement of “those people think that there are microchips in the vaccines” is a widespread talking point that serves to dismiss, intentionally distort a whole groups varying opinions, and de-incentivize people from asking more questions about something. </p>
<p>I personally do not think they are microchipping us with covid vaccines. However, what myself and many others will point out is that we are forever moving toward a more digitized world, one where the goal of those in power would like an increased and certainly not decreased forms of tracking people is the norm. Shit, just look at a corporation like Amazon and look how they track their warehouse workers and you can see what I am saying. It’s corporations and people like Amazon with bezos and yes…..bill gates who specifically push this type of thing. https://id2020.org</p>
<p>Couple these attitudes with that of The world Economic Forums And it’s leader Klaus Schwab. https://youtu.be/HRLw6trwXco</p>
<p>And technology like the quantum dot Tattoo. http://news.rice.edu/2019/12/18/quantum-dot-tattoos-hold-vaccination-record/</p>
<p>It is not unreasonable to form an opinion that the first mass experimental inoculation event would be at the very least a stepping stone towards an extremely invasive overstep of our right to personal privacy and bodily autonomy. A very weasly way to avoid such a discussion would be to try to convince the general public that a bunch of quacks thinks the government is microchipping them with vaccines……..that’s
My opinion anyway</p>

        <p>It was civil, and I'm serious about making the most of your life. Alot of doctors that are now on the outside from around the world are raising alarm.  I suggest going over to Rense.com there is plenty of links to info there. Also this sire Daegel.co. which is run by a former gov agent has predicted that by 2025 the US will see a drop in population of 100 million people. Don't know if it's legit but it lines up with a mass depopulation agenda</p>
<p>Edit, Daegel.com you have to dig for it under charts I can find the link and post it back.</p>

        <p>We're not all nuts here. We're also not all right wingers here. Not all of us believe 5g towers give us covid. Not all of us here believe in Jewish space lasers and not all of us here a Qanons. </p>
<p>There are some in this sub but those seem to be the minority. </p>
<p>Personally I'm just pro freedom of choice and eventually I might get the vaccine since I have severe asthma but overall I'm healthy and eat a good diet and work out. I did survive covid and let me tell you it really wasn't fun with the asthma and all. </p>
<p>I will have to get the vaccine one day but I just believe it's in a too early stage to be trusted and I should have a solid immunity against it since I already had covid. Funny enough the media and our elected officials don't want to talk about any of this.  </p>
<p>I just want to have the freedom to choose if I want the vaccine or not.</p>

        <p>I totally get that! I've just seen so many posts a threads labeling anti-vaccers as crazy and weird. I just like to hear all sides of the story before I make any opinions. But I do respect the freedom of choice. Fear and speculation are natural instincts, especially with huge formations like the government</p>

        <p>Social media media has alot to do with calling us the crazy ones because I think alot of those people lack social lives. Alot of hermits are on social media and all this caters to their solitary lifestyles. When I go to fremont street in Las Vegas people who wear masks are the minority and there are always thousands of people there and that's why I believe the pro maskers have become sort of a cult on social media. They are saying we're granny killers and every event where people gather are super spreader events when the numbers say something completely different. </p>
<p>I used to have this one friend who got both jabs but still wears a mask and he doesn't want to hang out with me because me and my girl aren't vaccinated so I had to draw a line there because that's fucking dumb. </p>
<p>People seem to like having reasons to be divided and covid just gave alot of people another reason.</p>

<p>Now go to a pro vax and tell them you are anti vax and would like to have a civil discussion and let me know how it goes.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think we are seeing a lot of evidence that the loose spike protein is causing harmful side effects. I also believe that we will see high rates of infertility moving forward and wonder how tge media and scientific journals will hide or spin it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t forget they are likely going to require a booster shot every year or so. They will continue to develop these vaccines and maybe it will continue to get more dangerous or sophisticated. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Nuremberg code of ethics clearly states that all medical treatments and procedures must be voluntary and without coercion, and all treatments must first be tested on animals. The coercion methods, and in some cases outright mandatory vaccines, is quite scary. Especially for a vaccine that is not FDA approved. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So governments around the world are throwing out the foundation of the modern code of ethics that we are all sworn to uphold. If that doesn’t disturb you then something is wrong. Go read the Nuremberg code of ethics.</p>
