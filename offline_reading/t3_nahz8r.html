    <strong>Do you think they could've pulled off the entire Covid-19 Plandemic if there was no novel virus at all?</strong>
    <p><p>I see lot of people that are certain it was a bio weapon created in Wuhan, I think that is more misdirection.  I am starting to lean towards Covid19 not existing.  Between absolutely meaningless PCR tests where they can manufacture case numbers,  social media and MSM pumping 24/7 propaganda, lack of real world evidence, dancing nurses, dozens if not hundreds of logical fallacies being mandated, big box stores being immune, protests and riots being immune, the obvious politicization and division of it all, the new vaccinated class system, the fact that they are using it all to implement a totalitarian social credit system and great reset (that's the big one), and countless other obvious red flags I can't think of off the top of my head,  I no longer believe Covid19 is anything but a label.  They have labelled any and every sickness and ailment (and non sickness, because it doesn't even have symptoms!!!) that they possibly can as CV19. Hospitals were even getting cash incentive to diagnosis patients as CV19.</p>
<p>Why would they bioengineer a weapon that has the exact same, extremely mild symptoms and IFR as the flu? Why would they put their own family's lives at risk?  I don't know a single person to get extremely sick this year, or pass away from Covid (I know that is anecdotal). Most deaths happen at nursing homes, the average time a person lives at one of those homes, in North America,  is 6-18 months and bad flu seasons have always taken a heavy toll on them. If you can find nursing home fatalities from previous years please let me know because I can't find anything reliable. The symptoms are basically every symptom imaginable and no symptoms at all, what an obvious load of BS. How did they trick everyone into loss of taste and smell being a new thing?  Has nobody ever had a cold or flu with congested sinuses? The CDC just updated their numbers and something like 26,000 people died with no co morbidities in the USA, this should be a hot topic but isn't. The excess deaths for the year don't factor in 90% of cancer screenings not happening, all the lost visits to the doctor, suicides, etc.  And frankly, they lie about everything else and I believe they just lie about death numbers, it's the ultimate fear mongering.</p>
<p>This plan was created by some extremely smart individuals.  Every step calculated. Everything seen or heard on news is part of the plan.  All of it is propaganda techniques that are tried and true. They use the hysteria of the people to fuel the belief. </p>
<p>Regardless of your stance on CV19, I ask you this - could they have pulled this entire thing off if there was no virus at all?</p></p>

        <p>I think they just would have found something else, another vehicle to facilitate the whole thing. They knew they couldn't just foist all of this Insanity on us without a really big reason, they tapped into people's fear. Fear is what made people obey and comply. They would not have been able to carry this off without the fear element.</p>
<p>I work in healthcare and this virus is definitely real. I've thought about it a lot, and I've seen things that indicate that it's definitely something. I'm in New York City and there was a period in the beginning where people were dropping like flies.  a lot of patients that I stayed in touch with over the years through my job died and it was really sad. All of them had numerous health conditions though , none of them were healthy. It took them down pretty quickly. I have worked in healthcare for over 20 years and I never saw anything like that in the past. I saw a lot of other people get sick but for average people it was just a really bad cold, flu type of thing. For people that had comorbidities it either killed them or landed them in the hospital and they came close to dying. But most of that is totally over now. I was only fearful of it for the first month. After that I kind of figured out what was going on.</p>
<p>So for me, it's a real thing but it was completely overblown and co-opted for very nefarious purposes. If it wasn't this it would have been something else. After reading the recent Nicholas Wade article on medium I am convinced this whole thing has been one of the greatest crimes against humanity in modern times. It didn't have to happen. I wish I still believed in Justice and these people would suffer for the crimes they inflicted on us but I don't think that's going to happen.</p>

        <p>It wasn’t the Black Death people were being told it was. People were not dropping dead in the streets. Mask wearing wasn’t going to do much because people weren’t wearing them correctly and wearing a mask with other orifices exposed (eyes) makes no sense if you think this spreads by droplets etc. lots of inconsistencies that made no sense and I was treated like an illiterate peasant when I mentioned these things to other healthcare professionals at the time. My gut told me something was really off. I have a very curious mind and I felt an internal switch telling me to keep my mouth shut or I might be targeted or lose my job if I was too questioning. I never felt like that before , like asking questions was forbidden. Once the BLM riots started I knew for sure. It was like the pieces of a puzzle came together for me. I suddenly because aware of the psyop being conducted through our media and government. Every news story and article felt carefully crafted to control me and my thoughts and behavior. Fortunately I am a very inquisitive person and the questions kept mounting for me and the lack of answers and taboo of not believing Fauci et al cemented my suspicions.</p>

        <p>I think they could. The mind is a powerful tool. There will be plenty of people who have developed a little sniffle, convinced themselves they're going to lose their taste and smell due to the fear of what could come, and then believe they have.</p>

        <p>Well, I only know about the virus from hearsay. I only know about viruses as a concept from hearsay.</p>
<p>I don't have any way of confirming or disproving whether they exist, what their function is, how exactly they do what they are supposedly doing or if the cause and effect of virus and disease are like I'm told they are.</p>
<p>I can easily come up with other explanations for all the things I've been told happening. Explanations that actually have fewer contradictions.</p>
<p>In my circle of acquaintances there was no sharp rise in respiratory issues. The only person who I know had a severe respiratory issue was my mom. She had it before covid was a thing. It turned out to be a side-effect of her blood-pressure medicine and went away once she swapped it for another.<br>
A pharmaceutical product being capable of inducing covid-like symptoms without the involvement of a virus or any other microbial pathogen at least indicates that there's other ways in which people could get sick.</p>
<p>So no, I don't think a real threat was necessary. The threat existing in the perception of people seems to be enough.<br>
It's kinda like superstition except that it is claimed to be scientifically proven superstition.</p>
<p>However, it simply doesn't match with my personal experience. And I trust my personal experience more than what people whom I don't know are telling me, when it comes to what I consider believable.</p>

        <p>I have come to the same conclusion recently. People have become so gullible why would the elites do more than they have too. They know people are brainwashed enough to just go along with what they are told. Look up how they done the same thing with polio. All they did was swap labels on different viruses</p>

        <p>Mate(ss), if you read the peer-review studies that were used to prove the existence of SARS-2 and the trillion-and-one symptoms of the syndrome called C19, you will see that neither pathogen nor disease exists. It exists in the media, on infinity-cycle-threshold PCR tests and in the Cash-4-COVID incentives for hospitals. I haven't spent time dying on this hill since the "vaxxes" were introduced because it takes far fewer brain cells and critical thinking skills to see that C19 psuedovaxxes are bad, than would be needed to prove that C19 is a unicorn flu.</p>

        <p>Early on you could visit the WEF web site which had a very elaborate widget that users could click on any category and it would describe how the cv19 would change every aspect of how the world works.</p>
<p>That page wasn't made in two weeks.</p>
<p>No, what I think is they had the center circle empty.  They needed an event to put in that center circle to be the catalyst for the change they wanted.  CV19 was serendipitous.</p>

        <p>Covid-19 Plandemic Hello everybody. Now that I have caught your attention, I would like to say a couple of important things. Mainly that people are being brainwashed as I write this into thinking that Covid-19 is real. Look at the evidence Covid-19 doesnt exist and it has been made up so big pharma companies can just make a shit ton of money. This is absolutely unacceptable, and I wish more of the public knew the truth about this and many other things. I have asked the government to show me the evidence and they still have not. I have given them till September to do so. If they dont then I am right, and we are all right. Every government has lied about the entire Covid-19 pandemic, and this is bad. Another thing I would like to mention is that of vaccines. Vaccines do not save lives and statistics show they are killing more people than they are saving. Modern Vaccines are bad, and they should never be taken up. Take Andrew Wakefield for instance, his studies have shown that vaccines cause autism in children and I completely back his study. They should have not done what they did to him, but times have changed. We will not let the government put an experimental vaccine containing a microchip into us just to control us. Yes, that is what they are trying to do and if you still do not believe me then I ask you to be sympathetic to all the families that have lost loved ones to vaccines thinking they were ok. I would also ask you to do more research because vaccines nowadays contain all sorts of additives and are bad compared to 100s of years ago. Furthermore, these modern vaccines were made so quickly. How do you think this was possible in ten months? Because they paid scientists to do it very quickly and so that they could install microchips into us all. Not only that but this proves that the virus does not exist. Otherwise, they would have taken their time. Finally, the government are trying to get you to take the vaccine which contains a microchip so that you will be in their control in something I call the final repression after use of lockdowns and public health measures. Dont let them make a fool out of you because you the people deserve to know the truth and cannot be restricted like this. Vaccines do not save lives but ruin them. Fight back against the government because it is the right thing to do.</p>

        <p>It exists, it has been isolated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/grows-virus-cell-culture.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/grows-virus-cell-culture.html</a></p>
<p>It is time to move on past the moronic thinking that "It just DERSN'T BLIXTIST!"</p>
<p>You cannot fight against something while denying it exists. You can fight against something by pointing out that by the numbers, SARS-CoV-2 is a weak sauce virus that was not worth shutting down businesses and mandating masking over.</p>
<p>Seriously: Even though my parents died due to medical negligence connected with this disease, I have to realize that it was weak sauce and for the bulk of the truly healthy (proper amounts of vitamins and minerals in their bodies) wasn't a real threat.</p>
<p>The biggest thing that made a lot of people worry over SARS-CoV-2 is the chaotic nature of the damned virus. A lot of the people getting sick and dying in the under 50 set were healthy people. Quite a few bodybuilders, ballerinas, etc. (people in best shape of their lives) which scared the Number 2 out of a lot of young people.</p>
