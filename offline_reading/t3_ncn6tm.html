        <p>Yeah. That's the point- the air which is filled with aerosol particles has to go somewhere and most goes through the path of least resistance. Around the perimeter of the mask.</p>
<p>Masks don't stop exhalation and inhalation of aerosols that can hang in the air for hours.</p>
<p>In fact there has been decades of research on masks.  Masks have never been taken seriously in pandemic planning because the evidence that they do anything is weak. Here is just one review published by the CDC at the start of the pandemic:</p>
<p>&rt;In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946–July 27, 2018. In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>There are many more reviews that say the same.</p>
<p>They all said this in the beginning:
https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/meeutj/the_evidence_around_facemasks_especially_outdoors/</p>
<p>They suddenly flipped their stance. This is possible to change your view  but with sound research. A series of well designed RCTs with strong results.  But they had none of those.  They flipped due to political pressure to <em>do something</em></p>
<p>To date not a single RCT haa been done showing that masks work against the spread of COVID.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that political organizations aren't susceptible to political bias and political pressure?</p>
<p>I mean you tell me.  Where are the RCTs hat caused them to change their opinion from this:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/meeutj/the_evidence_around_facemasks_especially_outdoors/</p>
<p>to requiring masks everywhere?</p>
<p>Because in order to change their opinion you need evidence.  </p>
<p>&rt;Dude was expecting the smoke to be stuck in his mask or something? WTF? </p>
<p>Replace virus carrying aerosols with smoke in your statement. It's not smoke its vapor but the vapor particles you see is the same size or larger than aerosol particles that carry virus. So if it is not stopping vapor it won't stop aerosols.</p>

        <p>Case closed, dude.  Guy vapes through mask. This whole time, no one even realized that you can vape through masks!  Right there on the video. </p>
<p>That other bizarrely and carefully edited video also mentions that there haven't really been any trials about mask wearing before he continued on to say that there is no evidence that mask wearing does anything.  </p>
<p>Linking things to you about the efficacy of masks wouldn't  make much of a difference to you, so I'll spare you.</p>

        <p>Because you don't have it.  No one does.  To date there is not a single RCT that shows that masks work to prevent the spread of COVID</p>
<p>You don't understand that the vaping is to visualize that small particles like water vapor are not stopped by wearing a mask.  The same as water particles that  CARRY the virus that infects people is not stopped. They are even smaller particles that you can't see (water vapor ~ 10 microns, aerosols that carry viruses 0.5 microns).</p>
<p>So explain how if it can't stop vapor how is it stopping aerosols?</p>

        <p>It didn't convince me.  Reading the studies did.  I found the video much later.</p>
<p>Btw when I started reading the studies I thought that masks would have some effect.</p>
<p>&rt;There must be a couple of RCT's that show how ineffective masks are, right?</p>
<p>I just linked you the CDC review of 10 RCTs that concluded masks didn't work for influenza.</p>
<p>And that's not how science works. You don't disprove a negative. The process is if you male a claim you do well designed studies to prove it something works. If you don't have that you have nothing.</p>

        <p>Yep but as there is only one mask RCT for COVID (which showed no effect) we need to go back to the flu. The flu virus size is a similar size to COVID particles so if it's not blocking aerosols for the flu it's  likely not for COVID either.</p>

        <p>Listen, if these masks allow particles through which are larger than whatever vector Covid-19 spreads via, then obviously wearing one would make no difference.  All I'm saying is that this video does not show such a claim, and neither does that study you linked.</p>

        <p>It spreads by aerosols.</p>
<p>I addressed this above.  The video shows larger particles escaping (water vapor particles are ~10 microns) than the majority of aerosols that hold the virus (&lt;0.5 microns)</p>
