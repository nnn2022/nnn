    <strong>If &amp; when vaccinated people get flu symptoms, will they seek out a Covid test or assume it's not Covid because they've been vaccinated?</strong>
    <p><p>I have a friend with an autistic daughter. During the day she goes to a school/ program for adults with developmental disabilities. It's been closed for about a year due to Covid, but she's soon going back. She has all the issues with not wearing a mask, sensory issues, etc. We still have a mask mandate in our state. Apparently, they aren't as worried about them wearing the masks full time because  of the workers and students have been Vaccinated. I was thinking how it would be interesting in this group to see if anyone gets sick. But then I thought, "will they even suspect it's covid if anyone DOES get sick?" Maybe they'll just assume they have a cold or flu and won't bother to get tested.  This is a possible way the numbers could actually go down. People just having full trust in the vaccine. Apparently, the cases of people being testing positive for Covid after vaccination have been mostly scenerios where people were required to get tested on a regular basis for their job.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Will people still continue to get tested after vaccination?</p></p>

        <p>Well I mean you should still test positive for a Covid after getting the shot because the shot only reduces symptoms and hospitalisation. </p>
<p>The shot only makes your body create the spike protein of the virus which has interesting effects. I would be more scared of what vaccinated people are transmitting then actually getting the natural virus</p>

        <p>Of course they will. The biggest thing that will reduce the 'Covid numbers' is that once jabbed, no one is required to be tested without any symptoms though. </p>
<p>Ya know, the test with a high false positive rate &amp; the never ending demands for people with no symptoms to be tested now...</p>

        <p>Just as I suspected. They don't want people getting tested after vaccination because it will prove that the vaccine doesn't work. WE know that it only decreases severity of symptoms, but I don't think most people know that (or don't bother to look into it).</p>

        <p>Yep, the popaganda is somehow that everyone ELSE has to be forced to take it, or they are 'selfish', but as advertised it will not stop anyone from being infected or contagious, only that it (supposedly) reduces fatality. </p>
<p>So, reducing testing of people with no symptoms means they are not counted &amp; those who never had it don't get counted by the high false positive rate.</p>
