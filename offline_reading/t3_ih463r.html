    <strong>I almost got a Wal-Mart employee fired for asking me to put on a mask.</strong>
    <p><p>TD;LR: <strong>Almost got a Wal-Mart employee fired for asking me to put on a mask, but she was backed up by a doomer General Manager.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So I was going to Wal-Mart at about 12 PM because the bait shrimp they sell is a lot cheaper than the pier we were going to. I walk past the dumb shopping cart barrier thet tied together, and I hear</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Do you have a mask?"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I actually didn't hear it, so she said it louder and I heard her.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Sir, do you have a mask?"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"I have a medical condition."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I lied, as I refuse to expose myself to an incresed chance of getting bacterial broncitis.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"What condition do you have?" She said.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"I also have HIPAA laws protecting me from being asked that, and I suggest you get out of here because you are about to be fired."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I called over a general manager, (Ironic, as GM's name was Karen) talked to her about it, got into an argument about the effectiveness about masks, all ending with her handing me some doomer propoganda that had the CDC stats on Plandemic 0 doubled.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>She probably saw through it because I was wearing a shirt that said something along the lines of "masks don't work" and had like 20 links on the back proving the point. Sadly, I ripped the shirt at the pier when somebody's lure caught my shirt and ripped it really bad (It was 9PM and dark)</p></p>

        <p>There's been a huge influx of stories like this in this sub in the last two days or so, of people confronting workers or customers or whoever, "putting them in their place", and with a topping of the offending "Karen" being fired or kicked out or some other form of punishment. These stories are coming from people who are not regulars in this sub, and tend to be one of, if not the actual first, posts here. </p>
<p><em>Strange</em>, isn't it?</p>

        <p>They're honestly stupid, cringe and not believable.</p>
<p>Every time I go to Walmart grocery and they ask if I have a mask I just say "I do not" and continue walking. That's it, these stories are what people idolize in their minds they wish would happen. Like arguing in the shower.</p>

        <p>In my state, masks are mandatory in public at all times (and the compliance rate is super high), so whenever I've tried to go in without one, the workers usually, politely, say they can't allow someone unmasked to go in, and if I want to buy something, to shop for it online. So far, I haven't had an actual angry confrontation with a retail worker (just a semi-creepy one at Best Buy though even that wasn't all that bad either).</p>

<p>They ask you to put a mask on because it’s usually a corporate or even state mandate, they don’t usually care that much about Doomer propaganda, they’re just doing what they have to do to not get fired from their job.</p>

        <p>No seriously this is real. You could tell that it was Doomers making. It was CDC looking, but the stats on the sheet were doubled. You could tell she was a doomer, she had her mask AND a face shield on. Reminded me of those people with a mask and a whole plastic cube around their head.</p>

        <p>Literally, LITERALLY, 99% of all immunologists say to wear masks to stop the spread of COVID-19. Why would you choose to listen to a few crazies on the Internet? It's just totally illogical and completely indefensible.</p>
<p>Seriously, think about this. Why do you choose to believe just a teeny tiny minority of crazies? </p>
<p>You aren't special, so stop behaving like a snowflake and wear your goddamn mask.</p>
<p>Also, how in the hell did I end up in this shithole sub of stupid?!</p>
