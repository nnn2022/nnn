    <strong>Don't be too mean with Doomers that post in this sub</strong>
    <p><p>I might get downvoted from saying this, but hear me out! You might have noticed that this subreddit is getting quite some attention from doomers. They post some silly things here. But, if you look at their profiles, they are either little kids or people who are grieving after losing a family member to COVID.</p>
<p>Don't get mad with kids. And if it's someone grieving, just be patient with them.</p>
<p>I like the types of discussions that come out of this sub. It's a good place to find arguments and evidence. It's a tough time to everyone, but we are stronger together. Life WILL return to normal. Stay strong brothers! :)</p></p>

        <p>I agree, but when someone comes in here trolling, ignore him altogether. It's just a waste of time.</p>
<p>If you want to actually convince someone, look for rational people (those who don't curse every 2 seconds) and skeptics.</p>

        <p>I agree. People have a hard time being level-headed when they’ve been personally affected by something. Someone who has had a family member murdered may be more afraid of dying in that way and may believe murder is a more relevant problem in society, despite the statistics and the fact that you are very unlikely to die in that way. I hope that the fact they’re even on this subreddit is a slow step in the right direction.</p>

        <p>No one is permanently at any side. If you want to show them that rejecting the new normal is the rational side to be at, you need to be able to understand why they think it's not, which you'll find that it's heavily tied to emotional reasons, plus a culture that saving lives should be above everything else. Emotions can be handled, with patience, empathy and persistence. Hating them will only make them even more sure this isn't the "right side". Let instead argue politely and show that liberty is as precious as life itself as there is no life without freedom (only lifeless survival). Let us show that without freedom, the loss of lives would be even bigger. :)</p>

        <p>How much patience do they need exactly? It's been a year. Some people will just always be sheep. There is a ultimate reality here it is a matter of everyone has a point. The people in power have been lying so blatantly that you have to be a total moron to still buy into this. I understand not knowing all the details but come on they want to inject you with a rna altering substance for what amounts to the flu.</p>

        <p>I agree with you.  I have family that believe pretty much everything they see on the news and I love them nonetheless. Hoping they come around eventually but I'm not going to push them away.  We should try to be more compassionate and understanding.  The powers that be wants neighbors fighting each other and we should resist that.</p>

        <p>The entire human history is basically people telling other people to blindly believe the thing they believe (either science or religion or other things depending on the historical time).</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I remember church pastors distorting spirituality and telling me to blindly believe in their cult norms. I used to be very skeptical and laugh at them. Now it's people distorting science and telling me to blindly believe in their norms. I'm still skeptical and laughing at them.</p>
<p>Nothing changed. I was happy as a child (despite all the brainwashing attempt). I never bothered as a child. Why should we bother now? That's just human nature. We listen, we think if it makes sense, we discard what doesn't, we learn with what does, and we move on.</p>
<p>Getting mad with these people is like getting mad at a bee for stinging you. Don't waste yourself. And keep being skeptical because that won't be the last time you have to deal with it. This same problem will show up again disguised as something else in the long future. :)</p>

        <p>You know, if it wasn't for the fact that vast majority of those people keep advocating for my kids to be deprived of normal childhood until further notice, I might even agree with you. But since that's exactly the case, the way I see it, they fully deserve what they're getting, and then some. I can sympathize with people, and especially when they lost a loved one, but I don't see how that loss justifies what they're pushing.</p>

        <p>I've mixed feelings on this. Mostly because they dont allow us the same courtesy when we come to their subs. I made one comment on r/covidiots about basically how polite people are found on both sides and some other stuff. And i was told in no uncertain terms to fuck off and that no one of "my kind" was polite and we were all murderers etc etc.  </p>
<p>Imagine how we would get treated there if we (truthfully) told them of all the people who died due to depression or domestic abuse or from delayed surgeries etc during this pandemic, or any of the horrible consequences of this whole new normal.  We would 100% get shouted and cursed out of their subs and banned for good measure.  </p>
<p>Now, normally I'm all for "be the bigger person" and stuff like that, showing them a good example. But after months of this I'm done with the doomers. I'm done being patient with them, being polite and answering their questions when none of that is reflected at all in how we get treated in return.   </p>
