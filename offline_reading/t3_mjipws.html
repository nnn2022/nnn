        <p>It's not going to take over your body. You might have side effects. You may not. Just don't participate in any tracking programs no matter what. </p>
<p>The problem most of us here have is that were don't know the safety of this thing.</p>

        <p>My basic understanding is that a vaccine introduces a deactivated sample of a virus for your immune system to recognise and destroy for future reference whereas this vaccine is actually gene therapy which is where it alters your DNA directly for fighting viruses. You can’t just detox from a change in your DNA like that. It’s not something to flush out. And that’s also why this vaccine is not by definition a vaccine</p>

        <p>A vaccine is a substance which stimulates a vaccine response, so this is a vaccine by definition </p>
<p>The vaccine doesn't alter your DNA ( I don't think) as that would mean changing it, instead it tells your cells to produce a spike that covid has so your body can fight it off and produce antibodies.</p>

        <p>A traditional vaccine carries a dead/weakened virus, and when injected your body will recognize its is foreign and fight it off.  This is how the flu vaccine has worked for decades.</p>
<p>This not not a vaccine.  This is an "mRNA vaccine" that contains nothing related to the virus itself.  Do some research on the vaccine patents, you may find it interesting that some companies skipped animal trials and went straight to humans because 100% of the animals died.</p>
<p>source: background in parasitology and I've read through moderns and Pfizer's patents</p>

        <p>It's still a vaccine, you can't say it's not a vaccine, it's a mRNA vaccine because that literally means it's a vaccine.

        <p>Lol you trust those fact check sites?  Those are propaganda machines to the core.  If you want real data, look directly into their patents.  It's all in there, dont trust a "fact check" because you didnt read the paper.</p>
<p>Also it is only considered a "vaccine" because merriman Webster literally changed the definition of vaccine within the past few months (I think).  Before the definition change "vaccine" referred to the dead/weakened virus.  This is gene therapy.  I dont know if it changes your DNA but this is 100% not a "vaccine"...  come on I threw all the info out there and you try to debunk me with a fact check from apnews.com...</p>
<p>Does the "vaccine" prevent transmission of the virus?  Does it simply prevent symptoms from occurring or does this "vaccine" actually keep people from getting infected?  I'm gonna leave this one to you.</p>

<p>It actually isn't a valid question. Over 60% of the world are below the poverty line. Don't shit on anybody for not being able to afford their own home/land. You are shitting on the majority of humanity at this point with that attitude.</p>
<p>Ten years ago I was working 2 jobs @ about 60-70 hours per week, and I still qualified for food stamps. That was <strong>ten years ago</strong>. Nothing has changed, nothing has been fixed. It's much worse now.</p>

        <p>80% of the world lives in impoverished countries. You, by virtue of posting on the internet in English, are 99.99999% likely NOT in an impoverished country. (So enough of that particular bullshit.) Therefore, it is incredibly likely that you are able to find work relatively easily. Second, you do NOT need to BUY LAND to emancipate yourself from your GF's family (this is so ridiculous that I don't know why I'm responding). If you were my daughter's (or Grandaughter's BF and claimed you couldn't afford/work for a place of your own, I'd jab you too). I'm just going to say it: It's 99.999% likely that you are a spoiled little Peter Pan who doesn't want to grow up and take responsibility for yourself (which shows in your weakness at being "unable" to say "no" to someone). If you were working ten years ago and still haven't figured out how to rise about minimum subsistence, haven't figured out how to rent a small apartment so you can be in control of your own life, and are waiting for "others" or "systems" to "fix" things for you, you're going to be in poverty and not in control for your ENTIRE life. So get used to it, Sally.</p>

        <p>You are missing a few important factors though; nobody chooses their parents, nobody chooses their race, nobody chooses their sex, nobody chooses their country of birth. Etc. </p>
<p>Facts don't insult me, you are NOT wrong here but you are trying to champion the facts for all the wrong reasons. I used to be like you so you will learn this eventually you have a good head on your shoulders. Take care.</p>

        <p>Well... You kind of took an L on this if I'm honest. Just pray to God and hope that nothing happens. Ain't a lot to it tbh. You got it and that's it. Done. There's probably not much you can do right now. They chose a vaccine for a reason. A "good" one.</p>
