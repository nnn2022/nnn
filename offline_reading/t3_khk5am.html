    <strong>Something has been bothering me</strong>
    <p><p>We have 70 million confirmed cases of covid (approximately, I can't be bothered to research the current number). That's 1 in 100 people on Earth who have had a covid positive test. Approximately 69 million "survivors" (I'm on the verge of bursting into laughter for calling them survivors, but bear with me). </p>
<p>How come this tremendous amount of people is still on board with what's going on? They've had it (the virus). Most of them forgot what it's like to taste food for a few days and that was it. However, a large number (statistically this is most likely true) have to have been left jobless, on the streets, or mentally scarred by all these restrictions. I'm not hearing their voices! That's approximately 1% of the entire world population. </p>
<p>Does a positive test come with a bribe? Are humans that docile and stupid?</p></p>

        <p>No bribes, people are just that docile and stupid.</p>
<p>People here continue to say the people afraid are a "minority of a minority" but this is just not the case. If there were 70 million+ people who opposed the lockdowns and restrictions, this would have ended by now. It's that simple. More than 70 million people going against this stuff would make a huge difference as opposed to, say, 22,000+.</p>

        <p>In Europe we have been given bribes. Admittedly they're all tax payer subsidies that need to be paid back but they've placated the population well enough.</p>

        <p>We have 70 million "CONFIRMED" cases driven by inaccurate PCR tests that do not show whether you are infected or not (they cannot differentiate between live and DEAD viral material) but whether you have been EXPOSED to someone who HAD CoVid-19 in the past 3 MONTHS!</p>
<p>Because that is the amount of time you shed DEAD viral material for according to doctors from Johns Hopkins Hospital, the Mayo Clinic, etc.</p>
<p>So I could be next to someone who had CoVid-19 within the past 3 months and be tested the next day and test 'positive' even though I am showing no symptoms at all.</p>
<p>It is bullshit and bullcrap.</p>
<p>We should only be counting confirmed cases where people actually showed symptoms OR you found LIVE viral material in their systems/blood.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean, but if you remember, according to the estimates, the actual number of people having been exposed to the virus / having contracted it is most likely 10x as much as confirmed cases. Now, counting a positive test as a "case" is a different discussion, but I think it's fair to say that A SHIT TON OF PEOPLE have had first row seats to the COVID SHITSHOW. Those positive tests alone might leave some mental scars behind just because of the last 9 months of MSM reporting.</p>

        <p>Nah, it's definitely a symptom.
I have Covid right now, &amp; it's stupid. I had a very mild cough for 2 days, a runny/stuffy nose for 4, &amp; now I'm just waiting for my smell &amp; taste to come back.
I literally can't smell a thing ðŸ™„ That's probably the worst part if anything. This isn't worth wasting your life inside for. Thankfully I've been everywhere since this whole thing started this year. Took me this long to get it &amp; I figured if it was that serious, I would have died months ago.</p>

        <p>I'm having a hard time figuring out why we are suddenly told to believe this is something new.  Seems like every cold I've ever had in my life has affected my sense of taste and smell.  When I have a cold I might as well eat wallpaper paste because that's what everything tastes like.</p>
