    <strong>Why are there no Covid protests in America? Will there be?</strong>
    <p><p>If they call out mandatory garbage and close everything off, like in France and Italy will Americans protest? Some say Americans won't get off the couch, if there is food and entertainment. I support the French protests and hope they keep fighting. I tried to find local protest groups, there was one group protesting Lockdowns in my state, but they seemed defunct since 6 months ago and had nothing to say about the poison "V". I found a few fully anti-vaccine groups that held a few small protests and one hospital protest against mandatory "V" on the other side of the state but that was it. Do you think we will have protests here or will they accept the nonsense? I know many people are just living life here like normal, who are basically ignoring it all of course.</p></p>

        <p>Too many are for the lockdowns. They donâ€™t care if the poor Uber or Grubhub driver has to work as long as they can sit on their fat ass watching Netflix or playing stupid board games</p>
