    <strong>Even the game Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (1999) saw this coming 22 year ago:</strong>
    <p><p>"As the Americans learned so painfully in Earth's final century, free flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny. The once-chained people whose leaders at last lose their grip on information flow will soon burst with freedom and vitality, but the free nation gradually constricting its grip on public discourse has begun its rapid slide into despotism. Beware of he who would deny you access to information, for in his heart he dreams himself your master." -Commissioner Pravin Lal, "U.N. Declaration of Rights"</p>
<p>Direct quote from the game. Thought it was interesting and very pointed.</p></p>

        <p>Other quotes:</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2020 (1988)</p>
<p>"It is now accepted among historical scholars that in the decades before the Collapse, America suffered from the sicknesses of racism and "cultural identity". Everyone wanted to be seen as special. Every group had to be "equal" to or preferably better than its neighbors, and fought to protect its "special" rights. If anyone had something that someone else wanted, they were painted as racist, sexist, elitist or worse. This divisive "me first" attitude eventually tore the fabric of American culture apart and caused it to self-destruct in a fireball of competing ideologies, none of which truly recognized each other's validity. Diversity led inexorably to anarchy."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Deus Ex (2000)</p>
<p>"Number one: In 1945 corporations paid 50 percent of federal taxes. Now they pay about 5 percent. Number two: In 1900 90 percent of Americans were self-employed; now it's about two percent. It's called consolidation. Strengthen governments and corporations, weaken individuals. With taxes, this can be done imperceptibly over time. The entire executive branch is hand-picked. Nineteen of the last twenty-three U.S. presidents have been members of the Trilateral Commission. The Trilateral Commission is financed by the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds."</p>
<p>"The human organism always worships. First it was the gods, then it was fame (the observation and judgement of others), next it will be the self-aware systems you have built to realize truly omnipresent observation and judgement. The need to be observed and understood was once satisfied by God. Now we can implement the same functionality with data-mining algorithms."</p>

        <p>Despite it being a work of fiction, itâ€™s absolutely true. </p>
<p>Think of what life was like behind the iron curtain. The amount of information people there had of the outside world was heavily controlled and restricted, because if they knew how good things were in the capitalist countries, they would realize the communist system and their politicians had failed them</p>
