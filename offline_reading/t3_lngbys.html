    <strong>Most french people I know are actually a bunch of hypocrites when it comes to covid thinking.</strong>
    <p><p>My gf she is french, and we expendend a lot of time with her family so by now I can have an opinion about them. </p>
<p>Starting by my girlfriend that she don't want to take sides, neither believe or disbelieve. </p>
<p>Her mother and brothers allegedly got covid early on, her mothe claims she lost her taste and smell and is convinced she was covid because she got a positive PCR at the time. </p>
<p>When my gf starts to question the main narrative all her family defends it and tell her that she is crazy for even questioning and that she needs to be medicated. However at least once a week there are gatherings at her house with family and friends, she they come over they kiss, they hug, they eat finger food, they smoke together and get drunk and they laugh and talk loudly. Last gathering they even had one of the friends who had fever and they make her come anyway, they didn't kiss her but that's it, she wasn't wearing a mask and forget about social distance despite they watch the TV news basically 24/7.</p>
<p>I would expect push back from the French but all I see is people wearing masks not because they fear the virus or take precautions but because they fear being fined. They defend the main narrative but yet they don't follow the rules whatsoever. They fear more to be called conspiracy theorist than "catching covid".</p>
<p>They have no problem with making gatherings with firends every single week but also they have no problem with making a 9 years old wearing a mask at school for 7 hours a day every single day. </p>
<p>French people: you have disappointed me.</p></p>

        <p>That's a good thing though. If people only want to appear like they follow the rules but deep down they don't give a flying fuck about them, it's a step in the right direction. They'll come out of the closet eventually ðŸ˜‚</p>

        <p>Yes but they are also known as the revolution country and I expect push back from them. They are known as the smartest and most civilized and the are ok with all the restrictions there's hardly any push back, even though I don't know 1 french person that wants to get the vaccine they say that the idea of vaccine passport makes sense.</p>

        <p>No, no, no. That's your impression of the french, not what they're generally known as. The french revolution was a long time ago, and even the french resistance during the ww2 was for all intents and purposes a joke.</p>

        <p>You see, in Italy vaccine passport idea won't fly, because of how inefficient everything is here. From what they're saying now, they won't even finish vaccinating people who are 80 years old and up by summer, and for any kind of restrictions to be imposed on unvaccinated people to be implemented while still getting any taxes in, they need to be able to vaccinate the entire population before they'll need to start injecting people with boosters. They can't do it and they know it. And on top of that, this country relies heavily on tourism. That's why passports aren't even on the table</p>

        <p>I also heard that Italy has a very strong anti Vax movement, also strict controls for food additives etc, I heard is the highest standards when it comes to food. </p>
<p>The thing about the passports is complicated since is supposed to be European Union and borders supposed to be open to all eu countries, how to think the idea of some countries introducing passports will affect the EU?</p>
<p>If I don't have to get vaccinated, looks like I'll live in Italy again.</p>
<p>Also did you know that in France they talk about not vaccinating the very old people beacuse apparently here they acknowledge that they can die. How's is Italy view in vaccinating the very old?</p>

        <p>The way I understand it, there's talk on the EU level about introducing something like vaccine passport, but that's only to exempt you from quarantines and testing when you're crossing borders. That's the only way they can pull that off without rewriting the entire charter, and frankly, considering how slow the rollout of the vaccine goes, I don't think even that will fly in the end of the day, because that would mean discriminating against majority of the population. As far as vaccine for old people go here, they're absolutely running the program despite the reports, but there's no real pressure. You want to take it, you take it, you don't want it, your business. Masking's a bitch though. They're dining people over that. And I don't know about anti-vax here, but there's definitely a strong stance against making vaccines mandatory</p>
