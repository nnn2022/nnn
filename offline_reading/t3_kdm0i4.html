    <strong>How does COVID compare to another cold virus known as RSV? What is the IFR of RSV?</strong>
    <p><p>I have friends who love lockdowns and ''the new normal'' because they say COVID is the most deadly strain of cold virus out there. But I've heard RSV can be very serious. Does anyone know what the IFR of RSV infection is and is it higher than COVID?</p>
<p>John Ioannidis recently revised down the COVID IFR, it's now 0.15-0.2%.</p>
<p>Unlike COVID, immunity to RSV is impossible (people vaccinated against it, develop worse symptoms when they get RSV).</p></p>

        <p>I truly believe RSV and Bacterial Pneumonia is what most people are getting from hospital stays. They're just rebranding it as covid since the symptoms are nearly the same. I've had quite a few nurse and doctor friends agree to this.</p>
