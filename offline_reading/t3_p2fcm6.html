    <strong>Delta variant was spreading before mass inoculation began.</strong>
    <p><p>This will not come as a surprise to many people here, but it shocks me at how little this is discussed in mainstream media.  It is now clear that the vaccines have reduced efficacy towards the delta variant, which was spreading well before mass inoculation began, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/what-we-know-about-the-dangerous-delta-variant/ar-AAMQtqG?ocid=uxbndlbing">Delta first identified in India in Late 2020</a>.  However, given that the <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/national/coronavirus/blood-sample-study-virus-in-us-by-december-2019">original coronavirus was spreading in the US </a> as early as Dec 2019 I would say Delta has been on the scene for even longer.  All this being said:  <em>It is unlikely that Delta mutated to avoid the vaccines.</em>  The vaccines are simply less effective towards new variants.  What is going to happen when a new variant evolves to actually avoid the vaccines?  </p>
<p>We have all but guaranteed this will happen due to the <em>the fact that the vaccines cannot stop transmission or infection.</em>   Young, healthy people should never have been advised to get the vaccine due to their low covid mortality rates.  By doing so, we are simply adding more vaxxed people the virus is able to mutate in.  <strong>When</strong> the virus mutates to avoid the vaccines the best case scenario is that we are back to square one in protecting our vulnerable populations.  Worst case, the virus evolves to become much more virulent.  This is an enormous gamble. </p>
<p>Take care of yourself and be prepared.  Our leaders have been two steps behind this pandemic every step of the way.  There is no reason to believe anything has changed.</p></p>

        <p>I still keep asking where is the different test for the delta variant? The pcr cannot even distinguish between the flu,cold or corona?</p>

        <p>I would like to know how they distinguish between the alpha and delta; given the PCR is not a diagnostic.  Do they send swabs for further testing?  Whats the process?  Anyone here work in this field?</p>
