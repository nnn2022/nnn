    <strong>I have had enough of the bullying.</strong>
    <p><p>I will start this off by saying that I am mask exempt, even the British government agree with this.</p>
<p>I don’t tend to divulge this information a lot, but I will say it now. I have Asperger’s Syndrome. I have major sensory issues, in particular with anything touching my head. The crash helmet I use for racing, must be the most perfect fit. Sunglasses, cannot just be anything off of the shelf. I hate people touching my head, it will literally drive me insane.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask is one of the hardest things for me to do, the hot breath and the way it tugs on my ears is enough for me not to cope with it. I tried it once and was struggling, my girlfriend had to leave me in the supermarket to pick the dog up from the groomers and I nearly had a anxiety attack (which has not happened to me in nearly 10 years).</p>
<p>Therefore, I exercise my right not to wear one. Equally, I agree with the scientists and specialists who do not believe masks are effective. The argument being of course, that they don’t prevent airborne viruses the way people believe and the fact that people believe they are invulnerable and ignore social distancing guidelines. That, makes perfect sense to me.</p>
<p>Here in England, there was no mask “requirement” for a long time. 99% of people, did not wear a face covering. You because the stores were enforcing social distancing, you could see this was correct from the people in the queues.</p>
<p>Yet, the moment the government supposedly made it law, a lot of people changed their minds. I do not understand these people’s logic, our own government told us not to wear face coverings as they were not deemed necessary. Yet, the government change their minds and so do these people all of sudden. This is the same government who lead us into a cultural oblivion of unemployment and economical collapse, but they still agree with them.</p>
<p>I’ve been going into shops freely without a face covering, I’m not being malevolent about it. I go in, then leave. I’m anxious enough in social situations with strangers, it’s even worse to me when everyone is wrapped up in cheap cloth.</p>
<p>Now, certain supermarkets here are ignoring the governments initial guidance on challenging people not wearing face coverings. This should be protected by the equality act 2010, but this apparently is irrelevant now. The government has removed the section which states that you will not be challenged if you don’t wear a face covering, opening people like myself up to hatred by thugs on the entrance who want to dig into my medical history.</p>
<p>It is horrible, I can’t get away from it. Me along with many other people, are going to be forced to feel like outsiders by people too deluded to used logic and reason along with a fair argument.</p>
<p>I tell you all here why I am exempt because if I’m honest, it actually feels pretty safe here in the supposedly darker realms of Reddit. But why the hell, should I share these details with Jack the security guard so he can bark “WHY” at me because I’m just trying to be normal.</p>
<p>But trust me, he isn’t going to learn a thing about other than the fact I can bark him back into his place.</p>
<p>I know more and more people are waking up to see that following advice from the government and Facebook is wrong, but I wish they would hurry up about it.</p></p>

        <p>Sadly, the situation isn’t much different in the US. It doesn’t matter if you have a justifiable exception, they don’t care. The biggest mistake we’ve made during the pandemic is treating healthy people as if they are sick.</p>

        <p>I hate all the "if you can't wear a mask you shouldn't leave the house" comments. How about, if you're scared of Covid, then YOU shouldn't leave the house and let the rest of us go on with our lives. So damn tired of fear being considered a virtue these days.</p>

        <p>The Monday just gone. Allegedly the Gatekeeper Karen at my town’s Sainsbury’s was physically stopping a man from entering, no involvement from security that I’ve been told of. Then again, there’s no telling how much detail has been shaved off as the story went around.</p>

        <p>Sponsoring attacks on the less-fortunate, at every level of society, is how the state maintains its authority on behalf of its contractors (the likes of Capita and Atos and Serco, whom I'm sure you've met...). It's like trickle-down economics, but real.</p>
<p>The best way to combat it is to throw it back on them: "why are you persecuting <em>me</em> to be good? Wouldn't persecuting those doing worse be better?" Enforcers won't have a road to Damascus conversation upon hearing this, but they'll never have a comfortable walk to work again...</p>

        <p>I feel like I could have written this post. I'm incredibly lucky to have a significant other who does the shopping because the panic makes me too faint to stand in the much longer lines. I've never had to ask for any kind of assistance or exemption in my life, but now that I need one it's apparently wrong to ask? The bullying has to end. I cannot wait for these stupid things to be gone. I'm sorry to hear things have gotten even more difficult for you.</p>

        <p>The health department in my county told me that mask medical exemptions are optional to the business. They're letting random strangers with no medical background make medical decisions for people they don't know by holding often essential services over their heads. Even my doctors never force masked me in their exam rooms (I also have a condition), but these random store clerks can as they make aspersions about the severity of your condition or mask tolerance level.</p>
