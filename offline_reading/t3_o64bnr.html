    <strong>My parents and Grandparents lost WWII</strong>
    <p><p>Oh they won the battle. That battle. Back in the 40's. But the small battles that started up almost immediately have smouldered unabated for over 80 years and our children are now going to win the war for the powers of fascism and communism with out firing a bullet in a new battle. They've become the warriors in the fifth column. Right under our noses. </p>
<p>Think about this. Critically. Don't knee jerk an answer. Give it a few minutes to stew and steep in your mind. MSM propaganda? Anarchism? Antifa? BLM Marxism? Just plain old Marxism? Cancel culture? Doomers and Anti-vaxers? Anti Capitalism? Communism? Anti war? Anti Remembrance? Anti History? Climate Armageddon? Add your own here. I know there are many I've missed. World leaders talking about a great reset?</p>
<p>I've got maybe another 25 years on this planet and I'm afraid I'm going to see the world my parents and grandparents fought against. And I'm going to be that little old man with only the clothes on my back being marched down the road to my new internment camp and my date with the showers.</p>
<p>But what do I know. I've only read history and it's all going to be different because our children have all the right answers this time.</p>
<p>Welcome to your No New Normal.</p></p>

        <p>This dog shit comes in waves every hundred years or so. "Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. And, weak men create hard times."</p>
<p>Weak men are everywhere. Roll on hard times and keep a stiff upper lip.</p>

        <p>To a large extent I agree, but we must be clear: This is not socialism, communism, anarchism or whatever. This is the next stage in the evolution of capitalism. Just look at those in charge - those who call the shots and make all the money. They are the ultra-wealthy "superclass", the old aristocrats, the owners of the corporations, the political elite, the banks. They are the greedy ones at the top of the unjust capitalist pyramid. These are the people who worked with the nazis, who recruited the nazis - who ARE the nazis. </p>
<p>These people know they need a new way of enslaving the population and coercing us into new forms of wealth extraction. There's plenty of reading if you want to know what they have in mind for the future.  It's the same ideas about the Ãœbermensch and the Untermensch - about the totalitarian state etc. As George Carlin once said "They don't care about you!". They see themselves as superior and us as cattle from which wealth can be extracted. Nothing else. If their plan goes through, it's the end of mankind.</p>
<p>We mustn't let ourselves be decieved by their divide-and-conquer tactics. The million dollar question is how we can form a cohesive public unity and resistance.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I have a step daughter and son in law with 2 beautiful kids. They are not part of this New Normal. They are everything a parent could wish to have as children and becoming young adults and raising children of their own. They work hard to provide and don't hate because you're different. They are exactly what we wanted this world to become. But they are a miniscule minority in this brave new world. My heart aches for what is to come for them.</p>
