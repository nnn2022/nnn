    <strong>Delta = Greek Symbol for "Change"</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone think it's significant that the Greek symbol Delta typically denotes change. And it seems as though the second our restrictions were lifted and we were allowed to unmask ourselves we are  being hit with a Delta variant and told to put our masks back on....wondering if we are going to be told this is "Covid-21" and we are going to have to have a "booster shot" (3rd vaccine) since apparently even with a vaccine people are dying from this Delta variant....Will another lockdown be on its way? Stay tuned I suppose?</p></p>

        <p>Reading anything into the name Delta is silly. Itâ€™s called Delta because itâ€™s the 4th variant.</p>
<p>However, my suspicion is that about half of the people who are credited as dying from Delta are actually dying from the vaccines.</p>

        <p>Too tin foil hat with the naming, dial it back a bit.</p>
<p>However they are already saying that we will need a third booster shot because "it just makes sense", meanwhile Pfizer and moderna are rolling in liability piles of cash. free cash</p>

        <p>A prime example of conditioning. You opened with "too conspiratorial!" then closed with a conspiracy. The Greek angle isn't that farfetched when you consider how much the elite love hiding things in plain sight. It's their way of effectively thumbing their noses at us. </p>
<p>The veil has been lifted, friend. There's no shame in entertaining conspiracies anymore. We've been living in one for sixteen months. And they sure as shit aren't hiding their contempt for us dumb little peasants (aka useless eaters) anymore so go nuts. Tumble down that rabbit hole. </p>
<p>I did and it's a hard emotion to describe. I certainly don't feel happy or enlightened, but "awake", as cliche as it sounds, it probably the best descriptor. Everything I see now is just a string that helps form a larger web of deception. For example: satanic symbolism in our media? A year ago? Nonsense, don't see it. Today? You betcha, cobber!</p>
<p>The reason I mention that specifically is because I was balls deep in a binge watch the other night and while switching episodes, out of nowhere there was a bizarre pro-lgbt sports related advert with zero context (that I could glean) other than "lol gays exist, cope". Very incendiary in nature. Then at the end the camera panned up to find a modest little goat overlooking a cityscape. A goat, presiding over its domain. What do goats famously represent in mythology? Mhmm.</p>
<p>Not implying that it's a sin because I don't have a problem with the more innocuous aspects of the movement. Bodily autonomy and all that jazz. But the movement has certainly been propelled by insidious forces in the upper echelons of our not-so-civilisation. Nothing is too farfetched anymore.</p>
<p>Besides flat earth theory and reptilian insurgents. But who the fuck knows for certain? ðŸ˜‚</p>
