    <strong>Pro tip: The police are not going to switch sides and save us...</strong>
    <p><p>An earlier exchange got me thinking. There are many out there who seem to believe that we are going to have a "Russia, 1917" moment, and that the boys and girls in blue (actually, stormtrooper black these days) are going to cross the line and join the lockdown and mask dissidents. That they will join in the fight against the "New Normal".</p>
<p>You are making a grave error.</p>
<p>The police won't join us. Why would they?</p>
<p>- They are salaried, with some of the best pensions and benefits out there. Why would they care if the average citizen is locked down?</p>
<p>- They have been indoctrinated in law enforcement schools to see us as the enemy.</p>
<p>- They have to toe the party line to keep their jobs. The fallback excuse is "I was just following orders".</p>
<p>Lastly, and most important, you are not dealing with Officer Friendly, who rescued your cat from a tree in 1971. You are dealing with a wholly different animal. As I stated in an earlier comment:</p>
<p>There are two new types of cop, and neither are conducive to liberty, or good community relations:</p>
<p>-  "Officer Airborne", who joins after a stint in the military, has  untreated alcoholism and PTSD, and seems to think he is still patrolling  the streets of Fallujah. This viewpoint is encouraged by the fancy  stormtrooper gear and jackboots he is now outfitted in. He sees you as a  "civilian", a threat, and will beat you to a pulp or kill you on  command, or at the slightest provocation.</p>
<p>-  "Affirmative Action Annie', hired straight out of college to meet a  racial or feminist quota. No life skills or experience to speak of, but  had a 4.9 GPA in her major of 5th-Century Icelandic trans poetry. Always  ready to shop someone for an off-colour joke at the water-cooler, but  adored by her PC bosses. Annie will kiss any thug, kneel for BLM, and  simp for any left-wing cause. Especially if it gets her fat, blue-haired  face "likes" on social media. But she will unleash hell on you, (white,  male) citizen for protesting lockdowns or not wearing a mask.  Eventually she will be Chief of Police.</p>
<p>There will be no help from that quarter, I assure you.</p></p>

<p>Exactly. And depending upon how woke your area is, the covidphobes literally see us as subhuman disease vectors. You don't think there will be a huge social media outcry to "protect" the public from the likes of us?</p>

        <p>Yup.  I live in rural Minnesota.  The cops around here did not sign up to be the mask and social distancing police, and they have no desire to become that.  I know people who hosted weddings and literally called the local sheriff beforehand.  The sheriff basically responded, "Do what you want, but make it look like you tried to follow guidelines.  We won't do anything unless you go super overboard."</p>
<p>Back in April a local bar opened up as a protest and the cops showed up, told them what they were doing wasn't following the governor's guidelines, and left.</p>

<p>I think some NYC cops are the same. I've passed numerous cops while not wearing a mask. I've never been detained. Port Authority, NY Penn Station, the post office. Never given trouble by cops or staff.</p>
<p>No doubt there are the power freaks, but I think many aren't happy about being considered glorified hall monitors.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile in Melbourne Australia they are sending out the swat team with 3 vehicles full of cops to tackle a woman not wearing a mask or bust down someone's door for making an anti lockdown Facebook post. You'd literally have an easier time getting away with robbing, raping or assaulting someone in Melbourne than not wearing a mask.</p>

<p>But we need to be realistic here. Does anyone think the behaviour of the police in Canada or the USA will be any different in regards to the 'Rona edicts than it has been in the UK or Australia?</p>
<p>If they do, I would say they are being naive.</p>

<p>No offense; I know it is your country - but that smacks of the post-1956 Hungarian government saying "Look, our Communist police state is the most lenient one in the Warsaw Pact!"</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time in England since the mid-80's - both for work, and for leisure - and as an outsider, I could really feel the change in atmosphere there in about the early 2000's. And it wasn't for the better.</p>

        <p>Disagree with you. The cops are there to be won Oct. it’s worked in Italy. They’re all individuals at the end of the day, mouths to feed and jobs to keep. They’ll realise that there’s no point in enforcing this any more and that’ll be when the whole narrative collapses.</p>

        <p>Here is something hopeful from a brave Austrialian police officer: </p>
<p><a href="https://advocateme.wixsite.com/copsforcovidtruth/the-project">https://advocateme.wixsite.com/copsforcovidtruth/the-project</a></p>
<p>"It is now apparent that some officers share these same concerns. Concerns about what they are being asked to do. Concerns about oppressive rule and their part enforcing them. They see the erosion of trust occurring and as human liberties and freedoms are removed from their family, friends and communities in which they live, the burden is heavy.</p>
<p>"But one brave officer has had the courage and conviction to speak out. A Senior Constable from the New South Wales police force, Alexander Cooney has asked the Commissioner in an open letter to challenge the directions they are being given, instead of simply acquiescing to them and in the process, restore community trust and a return to normalcy.</p>
<p>"He has started a movement he calls "Cops for Covid Truth" and his letter is a compelling read. At Advocate Me, we have thrown all our resources in supporting him and openly inviting Police Officers across all the States and Territories to join his movement.</p>
<p>​"A unity is forming here in Australia and around the world. People are demanding truth, transparency and accountability in government and with some members of the police force lending their weight to this probe, it may be the very thing that shifts the balance of power in this way."</p>

        <p>The problem is even if some cops are 'good' the majority isn't. The police system is designed to attract and train people to follow orders no matter what and kick out those with the morals to resist. Good read, so I can only hope I am wrong but so far police actions in Australia have been among the worst in the world. Especially in Victoria.</p>

        <p>I agree its rare for cops to do what Alexander Cooney is doing and even consider the morality of what they're ordered to do, let alone risk their jobs and social approval and stand up for what's right.</p>
<p>In Australia they are famous for dis-arming the entire population. Everywhere they are famous for waging a brutal drug war and generally "sending hither swarms of officers to harass the people, and eat out their substance" as the Declaration of American Independence famously complained in 1776.</p>
<p>If only conservatives had the courage of BLM and Antifa liberals. Can you imagine if every small business and restaurant stayed open 100% since Day 1 of the hoax with Eff-the-business-license-police signs on their windows? I know--odds are the business license cops would obey their political bosses and smash the same windows that they ironically have always been totally useless protecting against BLM rioters.</p>

        <p>And the same people that hate enforcement of the evil-spirits-rules seem to be the same people who want to fund and arm to the teeth the evil-spirits-rules enforcers rather than disobey and disband them, so...</p>
<p>This can't be an accident. Only a decades long mass psychological operation can explain   such scrambling of both sides' brains.</p>

        <p>Saying there’s only two types of cop is such a broad generalisation I actually had to stop reading after that. 
Not to be rude but what is the actual point of this post? Doesn’t really contain any useful information other than your opinions. There already seems to be a lot of vulnerable mentally unstable users in this sub and all posts like this do is probably scare them more. I’ve had plenty run ins with the law and really am not their biggest fan but to paint them all with the same brush saying they’d enforce some draconian laws is beyond a joke. People are individuals, they will each make their own choice.</p>

        <p>My father in law is a retired Sargent and served in the army and he said they are trained to follow orders so no unfortunately many of them will never be on our side be it military or police. We will have to stand our ground.</p>
