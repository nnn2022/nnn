    <strong>Y’all hear me out..</strong>
    <p><p>I am as frustrated with all this propaganda and horseshit as anyone else, but I think we need to be kinder with our opposition. Most of us who accept the truth have had to swallow that pill of “oh shit, life isn’t what it seems” and that was a big bold step on our part, It took guts. We’re at a time now where the world is waking up, and a lot of folks are resisting that nudge. I believe it’s our job, (as those who have already seen the light) to help our brothers and sisters through the tunnel. There’s got to be a creative solution to this problem. The facts are there, we need only to find creative and light ways to present them. I know it’s frustrating, but this situation is like a Chinese finger trap, we’ve done the work they need to do, we’ve got to be the ones to bridge the gap. Things can get a lot worse or they can get a lot better, that power lies within us and how we decide to handle each other each and every day. Even on Reddit, these interactions we have influence how people go about the rest of their day, kindness and mercy are our ways back to being a United people! We aren’t going to comply, but we should resist in a way that doesn’t make us look ugly. To hear people out and let them say their peace, and give what you have in return without scorn, if they refuse to listen then wish them well on their way and pray they break free from the chains of fear. I’m suggesting we try each interaction with a sleeping person to be tender, if we fail that we try again the next time. It’s intimidating to accept what we know, I would say it’s akin to being an anxious person trying psychedelics for the first time. It’s a hefty pill to swallow, and our shouting isn’t helping the pill go down any easier. </p>
<p>This being said I’m very grateful for this community and I hope y’all are having a good day! </p>

        <p>They've taken away my right to protest in my province, say they will vaccinate our kids without our permission, won't let us travel outside our community and have unlimited lockdowns scheduled far into the future despite the vaccine being here. They say we murder grandmas, are stupid and should be denied basic services, probably should be rounded up and killed.</p>
<p>But, we asked them for data to support their beliefs. Sorry, didn't mean to.</p>

        <p>This place is a god damned mess. Never thought I'd long to be in Saskatchewan, currently visiting family.
And what's funny is when they put that no protest bullshit in in time for world wide freedom rally, there were protesters going on for what was happening in Israel. Public figers went to twitter to defend those protests well condemning the ones who just want the charter to be respected. Like fuck so backwards. The brainwashing is so through</p>

        <p>All well and good- turning the other cheek does have its limits.</p>
<p>The facts will not matter when the intended recipient won't entertain them.  That is certainly their prerogative.  The line is crossed when some invade with the intention of instigating something they can take screenshots for the purpose of having the forum banned.</p>
<p>For more than a few interlopers it goes beyond a war of words based on differences of opinions and versions of "facts".  It involves an ongoing concerted effort to silencing us by having what few places we have to converse with like minded folks taken away.</p>
<p>For those engaging in that- there simple are no cheeks to be turned.  I will waste no energy cultivating any empathy for someone who views my very existence as profane based solely on the fact that I see the world differently than them.</p>

        <p>I 100% completely agree and have been trying to be the change I want to see.</p>
<p>If we say and truly beleive that they are brainwashed sheep...don't we have an obligation to show them the truth? Do we achieve that by downvoting opinions or questions? Do we change someone's deeply held views by calling them asshole? Or by showing that in Canada for someone in the 0-19 age group there is a 0.0% chance of dying of COVID-19?</p>
<p>They are afraid and rightfully so. They have been watching fear saturated news for 16 months. They have read different sources than us. Of course they will have different opinions. They almost have a form of "Stockholm Syndrome". We need to treat them like a traumatized abuse victim.They are our peers and they will be the ones to help us end this or help end us. We are all being influenced by a Billionaire dollar ad campaign right now. Lets not push our fellow men and women into their arms.</p>
<p>On that note ... we need to destroy them.</p>

        <p>I am kind, they are not, are am still kind, they are openly hostile, I am still kind, they go silent (probably block me in all possible ways).
That is my usual path, but sometimes I’m tired, stressed, or both, and my natural state of giving zero fucks for babying grown adults while humoring their placebo fixations, and staying quiet while they repeat horse shit and lies, kicks in. Nope, not gonna muzzle myself. I will speak my mind clearly, without apology or hesitation, and I will not back down. This is my life, my country, and my liberty at stake. They will fight for compliance, and I will fight for freedom, end of story.</p>
