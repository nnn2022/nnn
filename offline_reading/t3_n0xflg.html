<title>They’ve always known masks don’t work. They’ve also known the virus isn’t that deadly. They had to push the mask theater so they could justify keeping the airline industry from collapsing under their “Covid is Deadly” narrative.</title>

    <p><p>Mask or no mask Planes have always been germ tubes. If Covid was as deadly as they claim air travel would be shut down full stop and the air travel industry would have collapsed by now.</p>
<p>Mask theater is purely economical.</p></p>

        <p>I'd say that's a great example of the many reasons. 
From July when the mandates came in, I was saying they were a security blanket for the irrationally scared. </p>
<p>But I've also come to agree at least partially with those saying they are a visual reminder to stay scared and a tool for compliance. A thing is rarely just one thing.</p>

        <p>They can’t uphold such an obviously conflicting narrative. The only way to salvage the billion dollar airline industry from absolute financial fallout was to come up with an excuse to open it back up.</p>
<p>Now we have mask theater.</p>

        <p>You can get a ticket for driving too slow or too fast on the highway. </p>
<p>Keep people just the right amount of scared to keep the system flowing the way you want. </p>
<p>I'm sure the airlines and other industries played into the thinking.</p>
