    <strong>Please understand.</strong>
    <p><p>When you’re dealing with these trolls that infect the subreddit - they don’t know any better. </p>
<p>They believe anything St Fauci tells them. </p>
<p>They don’t understand the years of Gain of Function research that was done since 2002.</p>
<p>In time, in a just world, they’ll realize that this virus didn’t arise naturally. </p>
<p>They’ll eventually understand that money motivates grants, research, and has the ability to make even good men/women, keep quiet and play along. </p>
<p>They’ll eventually understand that when they did the cost/benefit analysis, they didn’t think it really would eventually really “happen”. That their creation would hit the world stage. </p>
<p>But it did. For what reason? Intentional, accidental, we’ll never know. But they didnt come clean - they doubled down. </p>
<p>They got most of the world to believe them for a time. </p>
<p>But even now thats changing - those that cling to the natural hypothesis are a year behind what we knew from the beginning. </p>
<p>With data coming out each day, that the spike protein itself is the issue with the vaccine - do you truly expect these same people to come around to this quickly?  </p>
<p>Each day, as the anecdotal data accumulates on places like CovidVaccinated or the collection of the VAERS, their egos will outweigh their open mindedness for the data. </p>
<p>Thats their risk to take - in the short term or the long term. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the push for children to be vaccinated is a different matter. They cant look at the data. They cant make that decision for themselves. Focus there if you can. </p>
<p>I pray, that there are no long term issues - as it stands now, even the acute deaths or disability have sufficiently convinced me that it should have been stopped a long time ago - but “New Normals” have allowed it.</p></p>

        <p>I doubt they'll ever get it sadly. A few will, but not most. People willfully ignore evidence that causes cognitive dissonance for them,  I've seen this over the years. Ignorance is bliss for most of them.</p>
<p>I just block the angry smug ones.</p>
