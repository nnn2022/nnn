    <strong>Attempting religious exemption</strong>
    <p><p>I am trying to book a 2 day gig where the employer (a major company that you have most likely heard of) started mandating that all workers are vaccinated. They are allowing medical and religious exemptions. I am attempting to get a religious exemption and have been in email contact with a manager of labor relations. I was asked for a "description of your sincerely held religious belief that you are requesting be accommodated" and I responded. "I have developed my own personal spiritual belief system based on observing the sanctity of nature and respecting the natural order of things. My personal belief is that the COVID vaccines are a desecration of the natural body, mind, and soul."</p>
<p>She responded almost immediately with followup questions. "Can you please let me know if you have ever received any other vaccinations.  Also, do you or have you ever seen a doctor or sought out medical intervention."</p>
<p>I feel like the first question is a trap question. If I was okay with getting vaccinated for hepatitis or influenza, then I should have no problem with the covid vax. But that position is ores the fact that those other conventional vaccines are attenuated vaccines. They are natural. All three of the covid vaxes available in the US involve hacking your body into doing something it was never meant to do - create spike proteins. And that is why I view them as desecration.</p>
<p>I also think the second question is a gotcha question but I don't know what the angle is. Of course I have seen doctors. I am not anti-medicine.</p>
<p>I am not sure how I should respond.</p></p>

        <p>Just say you were vaccinated for other stuff before you converted to this religion. What can they say? How can they prove otherwise without religious discrimination</p>

        <p>Refer them to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The burden of proof is not on you to demonstrate religious belief.  The burden is on them to demonstrate that your belief is not sincere.</p>
<p>Which it sounds like their questions are trying to do: demonstrate insincerity.  As another person mentioned, get in touch with a lawyer ASAP rather than answering those.</p>

        <p>It honestly isn't worth it for this dumb 2-day gig. I responded honestly to the questions and if I get denied, so be it (and I am now counting on getting denied). It is easy for me to walk away.</p>

        <p>For future reference regarding the jab and religious exemption, here is advice I saw:</p>
<p>"Update on employee religious exemption from covid shot:
I spoke with an attorney in Florida who said that employers are asking if the objection is religious in nature and whether it is sincerely believed. The concern might be that if someone copies and pastes a statement about a religious belief regarding vaccines, then it may not be sincere in the eyes of the Court.<br>
     If I were to write my statement, I would make it in my own words and establish that it is a sincere belief of mine regarding my religion. For me, it would be the fact that I am pro-life and these shots have roots in aborted cells, whereas the influenza shot is derived from egg, in my understanding.<br>
      I also personally take issue with the fact that we are now seeing that you need this documentation of being COVID vaccinated in order to buy and sell as well as to be employed. That is very close to the warning in Revelation 9 and 13, and I very sincerely will not take this because of those reasons, as well. For me, it is definitely religious in nature and very sincere. That is what I would put on my statement if I were to be writing one."</p>

        <p>It sounds like they're going to want your medical records to verify your vaccination history. If you haven't received them since childhood you can state that your history will show evidence of childhood immunizations in which you were not in a position to give informed consent because your parents did that. Your current religious beliefs are inconsistent with the injection of chemicals into your body. You can even state that the body is a temple and you believe the vaccine could jeopardize your salvation by defiling your body/God's temple.</p>
<p>Personally, for a two day gig I would pass on it. If no one goes along with it, they'll be forced to rescind this invasive policy.</p>

        <p>I think you're correct on the first question. It's basically the same for the second. She is asserting that if you are okay with any kind of medical intervention than you do not truly respect the natural order of life.</p>

        <p>I wonder how it would go over to say your beliefs are part of a mystery cult, and therefore you can't go into more detail without violating the secrecy tenant of your faith.  I actually know people who were parts of religions like that.</p>
