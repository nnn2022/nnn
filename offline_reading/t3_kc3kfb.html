    <strong>Turning Point; Vaccine Injury &amp; Death</strong>
    <p><p>Unfortunately I believe the turning point of this insanity will be the injury and death caused by the vaccine. Many people may be fooled by this whole plandemic but are not willing to vax yet. Once people start falling out ill and dying from the vax it will cause great resistance against it along with the  passport/ID. That could be an important fight and if won it could be the start of a revolution.</p></p>

        <p>Here in Ontario, Canada, they are already talking about making a covid-19 vaccination card that you will have to show to do things like go to a movie theatre or travel.  And there are idiots still saying "the vaccine is not mandatory, you'll just have to show your card to do anything" like they don't realize that the only time you've ever had to prove you've been vaccinated for anything is to attend public school.  Organic coercion.  Not officially mandatory but if you don't get it you can't participate in society and will also be looked at as a social pariah plague rat... if they get enough people to swallow the pill like they have with masks.</p>

<p>Canada is probably going to have a slower roll out than Britain or the US.  I'm hoping there will be a large enough gap in time for problems with it to emerge for the overall population to question it.  But if that doesn't happen I'm literally taking all of my money out of the bank and TFSA (Tax Free Savings Account, something our Prime Minister has already hinted he's coming after) and going off grid.  Because I firmly believe that if one can resist the initial insistence to take the vaccine and the digital identity that comes with it there will be enough resistance that anyone who rejected it will have enough people &amp; evidence on their side to form a real defense.</p>

        <p>Alot of people think like us, we have to band together and create a resistance, we can't back down. Here in Alberta alot of people do not trust this narrative and will not vaxx. There's even more who believe in covid but will not vaxx untill it's "safe". The key is to wake up that group of people, and I think the vaxx damage will do that for us. Civil disobedience is the only option, we need thousands of people in the street resisting.</p>

        <p>I've been saying this as well. In fact, the leak from the Canadian government basically says they will be placing any dissenters in their isolation camps until they agree to be vaccinated. I'm going to wager a guess that the isolation camps will have people begging for death that will never come.</p>

        <p>The only turning point is when people start fighting tooth and nail. They will gaslight the vaccine and censor every single death. Do not think there is any piece of news media that will ever "wake people up", it is entirely word of mouth and real presence now.</p>

        <p>I don't think vaccine injury and death will be a problem.</p>
<p>Because it isn't a vaccine. Whatever else it might be, a vaccine it is not.</p>
<p>I expect them to have tested the payload on tens of thousands of people over the last decade before they decided to set the covid plan in motion.</p>

        <p>I'd like to believe you're right, but based on what I'm seeing, I don't think it would take much effort for the media to convince people that the real cause of any vaccine reactions is actually some mutant COVID strain. The people rushing to take the vaccine already believe everything the TV tells them. Why would they start disbelieving now? All it takes is for some dude in a white lab coat on TV to fully discredit the idea that vaccines can ever cause any problems. "Debunked! The science is settled!"</p>
<p>In fact just the other day I was listening on the radio, they were advertising flu vaccines, and made the claim that "you can't get the flu from a vaccine" - just stated authoritatively, completely discounting the experiences of many people who have had bad experiences post-vaccine. "You may have miserable, debilitating symptoms that feel <em>just like</em> the flu - but don't worry, it can't possibly be the <em>real</em> flu!" Sure, OK.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ups38aHGBE">clip of Piers Morgan</a> taking a flu shot from Dr. Oz, who assures him it can't possibly get him sick. Later Morgan relates he got it twice in the 3 weeks afterward. Dr. Oz's response was apparently that "the CDC got it wrong this year, they chose the wrong strain" or whatever. Pure fucking snake oil.</p>

        <p>Yes the propaganda and brainwashing runs deep but I feel like the difference will be the pain and suffering people and their families will endure. Unlike this hoax it will be real and tangible, people will feel and see it with their own eyes.Majority of people are hesitant or suspicious we just need to wake them up. Stay positive, keep faith and keep exposing the lies, all we can do is fight for the truth.</p>

        <p>I honestly believe the first and maybe second round of vaccines will be safe, that will counter all the "anti-vaxers" rebuttals , but it will pave the way for mandatory vaccines  down the line</p>
