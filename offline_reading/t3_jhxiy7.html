    <strong>Went on a date in San Francisco yesterday, it was depressing even though I liked the girl. Fuck this "New Normal" and fuck Gavin Newsom.</strong>
    <p><p>I met a girl on Bumble last week and we decided to meet up for some brunch and a walk along Crissy Field in San Francisco. I have not been to San Francisco in a few months due to the fact that almost everywhere is still closed down. The city is in absolute shambles right now, and visiting yesterday for the date left me feeling very disheartened despite having a nice experience.</p>
<p>Once I arrived about 10 minutes early for our date, I was shocked to see the once-bustling streets a complete ghost town. It was like the city was still stuck in March. Many restaurants were closed for good or still only offering takeout. Novelty shops, bookstores, and other cute little businesses were all mostly locked down. Despite temperate weather yesterday afternoon, everyone was masked up, with many pedestrians adding on ridiculous face shields and rubber gloves as well. Discarded surgical masks littered the already-filthy gutters and sidewalks. The strong scent of urine and fecal matter wafted through the air, even through the mask I was wearing (so much for protection from airborne pathogens, right?).</p>
<p>Once the girl arrived, we had a pleasant experience overall, but the date was significantly hampered by the above-mentioned conditions created by our state's absurd lockdown policies. We took off our masks at our outdoor table to talk while waiting for our food, and a waitress came by politely asking us to put our masks on while waiting for the food. We both thought her request was ridiculous, but I felt obligated to comply and not cause a scene. Despite the unpleasantness of having to eat outdoors in such a restrictive environment, I had a good time talking to her. We both agreed that many of the lockdown policies were absurdly restrictive and that the current state of San Francisco was depressing. Despite the ridiculous restaurant mask policies, the food was good, and we went on a walk afterwards down to Crissy Field, which has a fantastic view of the Golden Gate Bridge. The weather was chilly but sunny with a strong breeze, and I once again removed my mask to enjoy our walk together without being suffocated. Once again, we both got harassed, this time by passing joggers and pedestrians who made snide comments about our lack of face coverings. At one point, a mom pushing a stroller with two babies (<strong>who were both masked by the way</strong>) made a passing comment about calling the park police. I thought in my head that I should confront her about how she is suffocating her babies, but decided not to do anything that could potentially make the girl I was with uncomfortable. We both agreed to find a nice spot to sit down, away from the mask-stasi.</p>
<p>While sitting down with her, I began to feel somewhat depressed, despite enjoying the company of the girl. We continued to have good conversations, but I started to feel melancholic. We had a small kiss, but I didn't really feel the sparks I was expecting, most likely due to my mood from experiencing the brutal reality of life in Newsom's California. Although I thanked the girl for a nice time before she left on the bus, I don't expect to go on another date with her, due to the fact that she doesn't have a car and I live too far away to meet anywhere besides locked down San Francisco. Normally, my first dates in San Francisco are filled with funs things to do; my ex and I's first date in San Francisco consisted of riding the ferry from Larkspur, then visiting Alcatraz, the Exploratorium, and stopping by a few cute museums along the way. Almost none of those activities are possible under current conditions. I've been on a few dates now, and despite my best efforts, it's extremely difficult to find somewhere fun and entertaining to take girls on dates. Many girls aren't even willing to meet in the first place. The state of dating right now in California under tyrant Newsom is so bad, it's almost enough to make me want to leave California entirely.</p>
<p>With every single typical date site closed down, there's almost nothing left besides going for a hike or outdoor dining (an increasingly unpleasant experience due to the colder weather). No museum visits, mini golfing, or other activities that I usually enjoy doing with girls. Even when we do like each other, I can't have her over to meet my parents or cuddle on the couch, and the relationship tends to fizzle out due to lack of intimacy. Every girl I've met so far through online dating has roommates or family who won't let visitors over, and my parents do not allow visitors either. Our perception of risk is so skewed that we're willing to accept complete isolation from the world and the resulting depression and anxiety in the name of "safety" from a virus that 99% of people will survive (and almost everyone who is in relatively good health). This lockdown and "new normal" will never be over unless we say it is. We need to march in the streets, just like in Italy and the Czech Republic. Here's the thing: both of those countries had the strictest lockdowns you could imagine, for months on months. Guess what? They didn't work. The virus will never go away, and the lockdowns will never go away either. Do everything you can to defy these inhumane, totalitarian, arbitrary edicts so that we may all live free rather than slaves cooped up in our homes.</p></p>

        <p>You seem recently very preoccupied with picking fights with people who are clearly a minority opinion on this site who have taken it upon themselves to make a space for themselves here where they express that opinion instead of interjecting it everywhere. When doing so you're generally kicking people while they're down. In case you haven't noticed, most of us here are being slowly killed by the side effects of these "pandemic mitigation measures". Loss of income and housing. The seizure of your ability to perform your calling due to no fault of your own nor legitimate reason. Loneliness. The crushing sense that even your smallest dreams aren't worth even dreaming of anymore, let alone worth attempting to pursue because you'll be stopped from reaching that finish line because fuck you, that's why. Because "we're all in this together". It's a death by a million cuts. I've almost died from a respiratory virus before. From a pandemic respiratory virus even; H1N1. <strong><em>*I would choose that death over the one I'm trapped in now, the one with the million tiny, tiny cuts.</em></strong>* Ask yourself why you've been engaging in the behavior you've been engaging in. It's not something that someone who's secure in their convictions and their reasons for having said convictions engages in.</p>

        <p>Oh I am certainly secure with my beliefs on the whole pandemic. I am engaging in arguments like this one because too many people are dying and in some countries, they're only increasing. There has to be a new normal for said countries, if people in the US had complied with the lockdown since the very beginning, it wouldn't been in this state, although I certainly should mention that the government also takes fault for not even give people a 'minimum wages to live until the lockdown had been open, so it's on both sides. If you supposedly got a severe respiratory problem before, then you should know that the virus is dangerous for people with a weak immune system. I do understand that people are really harmed from the lockdown but it's as simple as that if they go out without taking at least the basic precautions they're putting themselves and others in danger.
Edit: Also cmon dude, this sub wasn't made so you can simply share your thoughts with other people with the same beliefs, that could be a part of it, but the other part is that some people here are only here to hate and offend people with opposing opinions, literally defeating their own point.</p>

<p>All over google? And common sense. If you aren’t next to a sick person you probably won’t get sick?? And if you have to break distancing wearing a mask reduces droplets and airflow, making it less likely to infect another person if they are sick. You aren’t wearing a mask only for yourself but others but if you weren’t wearing one you are more likely to spread the virus. Masks stop your droplets more than others</p>
<p>&rt;The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.&lt;</p>
<p>&rt;Know how it spreads
There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.
Everyone Should
Wash your hands often
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It’s especially important to wash:
Before eating or preparing food
Before touching your face
After using the restroom
After leaving a public place
After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
After handling your mask
After changing a diaper
After caring for someone sick
After touching animals or pets
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact
Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.
Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.
Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.
Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people.
Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.
Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others
You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.
The mask is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.
Everyone should wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don’t live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.
Do NOT use a mask meant for a healthcare worker. Currently, surgical masks and N95 respirators are critical supplies that should be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders.
Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The mask is not a substitute for social distancing.
Cover coughs and sneezes
Always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit.
Throw used tissues in the trash.
Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect
Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them. Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
Then, use a household disinfectant. Most common EPA-registered household disinfectantsexternal icon will work.
Monitor Your Health Daily
Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.
Especially important if you are running essential errands, going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet.
Take your temperature if symptoms develop.
Don’t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen.
Follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop&lt;</p>

Masks were not normal? Distancing was not normal? 
I’m not saying stop going to work but start going to work with precautions that can reduce your virus risks, but with people judging others for wearing face shields or masks, your undermining masks even more than americans(if u are American) already are and reducing the credibility of it.</p>

        <p>What do y’all mean by new normal then please do explain.</p>
<p>If masks are not mandated, then of course the virus will spread more. You can see people refusing to wear masks, even when necessary. I sent you a source, that if you read, states that masks and distancing will help the most. The “new normal” is caused by coronavirus, is it not? What’s the best way to stop the new normal form becoming actually normal? Lessen coronavirus.What’s the best way to do that, take precautions. Go out only if u absolutely need to. Work from home if u can. Wear a mask. Stay a couple feet away, don’t talk to peopel as much, stay only for a bit around one person. </p>

        <p>We got there in the end. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Your original statement contains multiple presuppositions that you then state as fact above. The new normal is not caused by the virus it's caused by policy makers. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>If masks are not mandated, then of course the virus will spread more.</strong> This is fucking awful logic, buddy, I'll be honest. If you can't see how those 2 things do not correlate like that then I can't help you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The article you link, if you read it, contains an explicit request to not use surgical masks/N95 Respirators. Do you have any scientific sources (and not a study done by comparing mask polls to country/state declines in cases) confirming that aesthetic cotton masks and the variables involved in wearing them, work to prevent the spread of viruses?</p>

        <p>Wearing masks shouldn’t inhibit your life so much. If you’re talking about lockdowns, I agree it hurts, but we wouldn’t need to if people had the maturity to take the precautions required to safely carry out their job. People don’t even wear masks correctly.</p>

        <p>Yeah sure. But if we all distanced earlier and wore mask like we’re supposed we wouldn’t be in trouble with the economy. And if u read the rest I said that. All I’m saying is that people were already making the argument about the economy when the virus was not as prevalent however if we had shut down and locked down back then the virus wouldn’t have spread as bad and caused long term damage to the economies</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that. I’m also in the capital of wearing your mask alone in your car, aka the SF Bay Area. Where I am it’s not nearly that bad, I only wear a mask when I absolutely have to and have yet to be harassed. Looking to move my family out of the state. Best of luck to you</p>

        <p>I spend time in SJ and SF and see a big difference in how people think about coronavirus in SF.</p>
<p>SF is like it's ran by all of the people on r/coronavirus it's almost rare to see people even jogging on a bicycle without a mask.</p>
<p>I think it's probably related to politics.</p>

        <p>SF also has a high percentage of people getting fat salaries from tech companies and working from home. They don’t care. They don’t live in the real world. </p>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of people relaxed in the Marina without masks on especially around Fort Mason picnicking. I’m surprised that lady got so crazy because I see about 20-30% of people not complying so she must be busy yelling all day. </p>
<p>Also not sure if you ever get down to the mission but it’s more of an open air homeless shelter by the day and they obviously don’t wear masks etc. that lady clearly hasn’t been outside the Marina if she’s shocked by you not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>No it’s definitely locals from the Marina. The homeless are of course allowed to do as they please,
but I feel the mask BS is more relaxed where true locals live (deeper into the non-tourist mission and excelsior). The true locals can’t afford to keep this crap up as they generally don’t work for google. In neighborhoods without tons of tech workers (ingleside, ocean ave etc) have a different vibe for sure.</p>

        <p>The Bay Area is r/coronavirus and CNN displayed in real life. Mask nazis everywhere. No one questions anything that Democrat politicians command or say. I saw a man wearing a double mask (an N95 and a cloth mask) walking outside around SF and that summed up the madness of the area. </p>
<p>I took a trip to a suburb of Sacramento (a red county if that makes a difference) a few weeks ago and it was a lot more relaxed up there. People weren’t wearing masks unless they absolutely had to. People just seemed over all the BS restrictions and it made me hopeful to see other sane people in California.  The Bay Area and LA County are the California Covid doomer black holes.</p>

        <p>yeah I visited a buddy in the Sacamento/Davis area and it was pretty relaxed. No one bothered me for not wearing a mask outside of businesses. </p>
<p>Contrast that with LA, where I met a friend who had me wear a mask the entire time I was visiting him, and the usage seemed to be universal. People even had them while standing outside of the Griffith observatory (which of course was closed).</p>

        <p>It is horrible. I actually recommend people not go to places they used to love while these restrictions are in place. Why soil pleasant memories with the filth of lockdown? Yes, you'll intellectually know beforehand that these places are ruined, but that's not nearly as bad as actually seeing and experiencing it.</p>
<p>At least you liked the girl, so it wasn't a total loss. In addition to hiking, one can dance in an outdoor environment, so perhaps you might want to consider that. I agree with your conclusion: we must resist. I hope things will look brighter in your life soon.</p>

        <p>Wow this makes me really sad since I visited San Francisco for the first time last year and I loved every second of it. I can't even picture it in my head the way you described it now... But I know it's true. </p>
<p>I'm also beyond shocked that you guys couldn't even go for a walk outdoors without being harassed about wearing masks!! When did this start!? It's always been acceptable to not wear a mask outdoors as long as you're social distancing from people. This shit is just getting worse and worse. I'm more scared of people's reactions than the virus itself.</p>

        <p>I am so terribly sorry. I live in SoCal but in a remote hi desert community. Our county, San Bernadino is still in a lockdown. No bars. Indoor dining. No libraries. Nothing really. There is virtually no covid up here but we still have to comply with mask mandates etc, to get into stores etc. Reading your post made me so depressed. I feel for you. I truly do. I am older now but I can recall the thrill of first dates etc.  I simply cannot imagine dating in SF right now, so I commend you for at least getting yourself out there!!  Took courage. I disagree with some replies re standing up for yourself. It’s easy to say but not always as easy to do. You are young. I was a little meeker when I was younger tbh. Now, I am way more outspoken. But I will say that you should try at least to stick up for you self if you are confronted by rabid doomers. It would do you the power of good, I know it!! Good luck. Don’t give up. Try and find people who think the way you do and organize some get togethers? I have a core group of friends I see all the time. I wouldn’t be able to get through this without them. There may be some  Redditors  on these boards who would be up for this!!! Are you in r/lockdownscepticism It’s a larger group. Worth a try??  Good luck.</p>
