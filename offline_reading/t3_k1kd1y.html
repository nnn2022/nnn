        <p>For those interested, here's a translation of how this is reported in <a href="https://www.demorgen.be/nieuws/annelies-verlinden-wie-maatregelen-niet-volgt-met-kerstmis-krijgt-boete~b0ab1304/">the Belgian media</a> :</p>
<p>&rt;It remains to be determined which measures will apply exactly during the end-of-year period, but it has already been determined that the holidays will have to be celebrated in private circles. Howeve, there is a good chance that many people will flout the rules on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve. “Where necessary, the police will also ring the bell on Christmas,” said Minister of the Interior Annelies Verlinden in De Zondag.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;However, that does not mean that the police will raid here and there to check that there are not too many people celebrating together. But officers will be vigilant for signals that indicate that something is wrong: “noise pollution, large groups of people in the same environment, many cars in front of the door,” explains Verlinden.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Anyone who does not follow the rules will be fined. Verlinden: "Enforcement goes hand in hand with a fine." But, as Verlinden's spokeswoman emphasizes: that is no different from what is already the case. In recent weeks, the police had to stop lockdown parties on a regular basis.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Verlinden cannot say yet whether additional patrols will be deployed for checks during Christmas and New Year's Eve. This still needs to be discussed with the police services. In any case, everything depends on which measures will still be in force during the end-of-year period. There is a chance that we will be able to have a little more close contact by then, or that the curfew will be canceled.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Consultation Committee will meet again on Friday to review the measures. The rules may then be on the table for the first time during the end of the year, but it is in any case too early for relaxation and concrete measures. The assigned ministers want to wait and see how the figures evolve in the near future. The peak of the second wave may be over, but the decrease in the number of infections is slowing down at the same time. And nobody wants to be responsible for another peak just after Christmas.</p>

        <p>in the netherlands we're not allowed to have fireworks this year. Fireworks have always been legal here, though illegal stuff was also found here and there on occasion Mostly bought by "tough guys". But the less fancy stuff can be bought in your regular supermarket and the slightly more fancy stuff at special fireworks stores that pop up here and there. The big boom stuff is usually illegal. </p>
<p>I always looked down on my more rowdy cousins who bought illegal fireworks and couldnt get why they wanted to get the illegal stuff if there was legal stuff they could buy. I've never been a huge buyer of fireworks and never bought any illegal fireworks, but i always loved new years eve with the regular stuff.  </p>
<p>This year I'm considering asking my cousins where they buy their illegal fireworks and getting some. If i cant get it legally, I'll just get it illegally. And I will bet thousands of others are thinking the same. Forbidding fireworks is like  when they banned alcohol in america in the past. It'll only create a bootleg trade.</p>
<p>I will not let them take away my new years traditions for a feeble illness.</p>

        <p>Yep, if they have to source their fireworks illegally then, they sure as shit, are not going for the pissy firecrackers!! People will be filling up the hospitals with 3rd degree burns and missing limbs this year. Ironic because, The Dutch government’s excuse for the ban is, they don’t cause too much pressure on the Covid stressed emergency services.</p>
