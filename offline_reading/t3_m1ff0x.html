        <p>Happy coronaversary!</p>
<p>Sorry to say us ‚Äúdoomers‚Äù were correct and it didn‚Äôt end in a month, or when the weather got nice, or when the 4th of July came, or when there were widespread protests/riots, or when half a year went by, or when the holidays came, or when the election was over, or when the inauguration passed, or when....</p>
<p>There‚Äôs not much satisfaction in the vindication here. I hope our friends at r/lockdownskepticism who called people like me their ‚Äúown breed of doomers‚Äù last year when we tried to warn them have become less naive. The only positive of this is how many more people distrust the government, media, etc.</p>

        <p>My grandmother just turned 98 and is hoping they will allow residents to start playing bridge again. As she puts it: </p>
<p>"I'm 98; a fall down the stairs or an afternoon nap could be it for me. I don't want to spend my last days trapped in my room."</p>
<p>Do you think there's any light at the end of the tunnel for our elderly? Bad idiom I know but I think you know what I mean.</p>

        <p>There absolutely is a light at the end of the tunnel,   we're seeing it here.   We are 98% vaccinated so things can open up to a degree.</p>
<p>If a staff member tests positive, we go into outbreak mode and back to lock down for 14 days.    We have to test every resident 3x/ week and cancel indoor visitation.  </p>
<p>This week, we've opened up communal dining and communal activities.   There is a way to do it right, but when people get sloppy, mistakes happen.    </p>
<p>Luckily with warm weather coming, we can open windows and keep ventilation pumping.</p>
<p>What people don't understand is how fast it spreads in a nursing home and also that nobody here is alone.   If a resident is isolated and not getting any attention,  that is a serious problem by the operator.</p>
<p>When this broke out last year,  I  hired one of our entertainers as an in house entertainer.     We have bird feeders on every resident window.   and constant attention from the staff to meet the social needs.   This isn't a jail like the media plays it up to be.    This is a communal living space full of people we have to keep safe from an unpredictable virus.   </p>
<p>We are not trying to make this hard for our residents,  in fact, quite the opposite.   But having run a building with COVID outbreak,  you will do everything you can to prevent another one.   It was like someone rolled a hand grenade down the hall way.</p>
<p>It was the most horrific scene I have ever witnessed.   Nobody just 'died'.  They died horrifically.   Drowning on land, suffocating on their breath,  throwing up constantly,   and scared.   It will haunt me for the rest of my life.</p>

        <p>Florida has the luxury of being a warm weather state where people can congregate outdoors.  Up here in the north east,  during the summer-cases were declining rapidly.  As colder weather came and people had to be inside,  cases increased.</p>
<p>Just like the flu,  you don't catch it from being outside when it's cold,  you catch it when you're inside.     </p>
<p>Warm weather states also have greater levels of Vitamin D which slows down COVID.   Every state has a unique challenge,   it can't simply be 'well florida is fine, why isn't massachusetts?'   Sure it's been mismanaged all over the place, </p>
<p>Florida can open every window in a nursing home and practically be safe from it,  where we can't do that in MA.  We tried to crank the heat and open windows, but it's not nearly as effective as the advantages Florida has.</p>

        <p>Since when has it been the only way? Lockdowns aren't a new concept - Why haven't we been doing it every flu season, or <em>any</em> flu season? Why hasn't it even been suggested? Arent the methods of transmission very similar between the two viruses?</p>

        <p>The 1968 Flu season killed 100,000 people in America with no lockdown. 
We are sitting at 528,000 deaths from COVID in the US right now.
We did not have a centralized lockdown because people didn't want the government to take their freedom.    The second best option was mandating masks, and we couldn't even accomplish that because...people misunderstood that as taking their freedom.</p>
<p>Also, we have a flu vaccine.   and luckily now, a covid vaccine.   the future of COVID will hopefully mimic the flu.   But we botched it from day one.   </p>
<p>Comparing the Flu vs. COVID was entertaining a year ago,  but it doesn't even compare.   I've seen elderly folks die from the flu and i've seen them die from COVID.    and a COVID death is horrific.   </p>

<p>We can treat the Flu, and now with Bamlanivimab,  treating covid will be easier.    We can make progress and now we have to work harder to compensate for people that don't believe this is real.</p>

&rt;We are sitting at 528,000 deaths from COVID in the US right now.</p>
<p>No one cared about the 68 flu before this, and covid 'killed' about another 0.1% of the population - not a significant increase.</p>
<p>&rt;We did not have a centralized lockdown because people didn't want the government to take their freedom.    </p>
<p>We did not have a centralized lockdown because the government doesn't have the authority to do that - if you want that changed, write your rep to get the process going.</p>
<p>&rt;The second best option</p>
<p>so lockdowns are the first best option? Since when? Plenty of experts disagree with that.</p>
<p>And since when are masks the second best? What about herd immunity, or washing your hands, or social distancing? Where do those rank?</p>
<p>&rt;was mandating masks, and we couldn't even accomplish that because...people misunderstood that as taking their freedom.</p>
<p>How is that misunderstood? The government making rules for people to follow w/o going through the legislative process is an abuse of their power. </p>
<p>&rt;Also, we have a flu vaccine.   and luckily now, a covid vaccine.   the future of COVID will hopefully mimic the flu.   But we botched it from day one.   </p>
<p>Yeah we did botch it, the gov shouldnt have done anything. You have no idea how many lives lockdowns saved (if any), but tens of millions of americans lost their jobs and healthcare, and things like suicide/abuse skyrocketed. Can you say for certain that this outcome was better than just leaving it alone? </p>
<p>&rt;Comparing the Flu vs. COVID was entertaining a year ago,  but it doesn't even compare.   I've seen elderly folks die from the flu and i've seen them die from COVID.    and a COVID death is horrific.   </p>
<p>it compares, it has a similar death rate (again, within 0.1% or so of the flu). </p>
<p>&rt;Everyone says "Eh, its old people that die from it".  Guess what? you're going to be old some day.   so lets set the standard for our future,  instead of being selfish.   So when a pandemic hits and we're the target, we don't have to die vomiting, gasping, crying, and begging for help. </p>
<p>Guess what? You're going to die someday. It will probably involve crying and calling for help. I sure as shit wouldn't want the gov yanking people's jobs away on the off-chance that it delays the inevitable for a few years.</p>
<p>&rt;now we have to work harder to compensate for people that don't believe this is real</p>
<p>Right, cause the only reason people hate the TSA/NSA is because they think 9/11 didn't happen</p>

        <p>It was hard to get a job?  That's news to me.  I called every restaurant in my area to employ their staff and they all told me they'd rather collect.   Our biggest crime was giving a stim package before every job was filled.   These are facts.   you have an opinion and watched from the sidelines while we worked.</p>

        <p>Many people have been following the restrictions and guidelines which incidentally helped less deadly and infectious things like the flu (compared to covid) go down. But once again covid is more infectious and deadly so it takes less people ignoring guidelines to spread easily</p>

        <p>The flu is not less deadly than COVID-19 <em>in certain populations</em> (specifically the 20-45 population) and is only slightly less infectious, at least not less infectious enough to explain the massive reduction in the 2020-21 flu season versus past years.</p>

        <p>u/Windinhishair1990want to come work in one of my nursing homes next time there's an outbreak? </p>
<p>You will see just how possible that number is.    In fact, I think the number is higher.   </p>
<p>COVID wiped out 1/3 of my building in 2 weeks.   I saw it first hand.   I know it's easy when you're bored at home to pretend this is all a fantasy,  but I lived it.   and it is scarier than anything you'll see on TV.    </p>
<p>I sympathize for everyone in this group.  You're frustrated, confused, and angry at what is going on, eager to get back and be productive.    There are a lot of unanswered questions.   I understand your pain.   </p>
<p>But that does not give you the right to create information when you don't have it.   You want to see what it does to an elderly person? Go work at a nursing home.   </p>
<p>Hold someone's hand while they're begging not to die,  Then call their family and tell them that they died peacefully, when in reality they were choking on their own breath, throwing up all over themselves, and squeezing my hand while crying.      </p>
<p>That's how my last year has been.</p>

        <p>u/DarkTemplar26   The irony is incredible,  they are the sheep.    </p>
<p>The internet is beautiful,  someone can have an insane idea and they'll find like minded people to stomp their fists together.  </p>
<p>I'm mostly interested in the psychology behind this;  how people get tricked into conspiracies.    </p>
<p>I figured - after a year of learning everything about COVID and protecting my residents;  it was a good time to speak out to the people that will be responsible for keeping COVID around for a while.     </p>
<p>And I finally learned.   they just assume everyone is lying.   I'm sure they grow up in a household where they couldn't trust anyone.  Honestly,  I feel for them.      </p>
<p>To everyone in the group,    life gets better when you stop living in fear,  the world is not fooling you,   the leader of this movement is fooling you.</p>
