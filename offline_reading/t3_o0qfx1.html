    <strong>Lets Discuss Lockdowns</strong>
    <p><p>Since mask wearing lockdown supporters often resort to conjecture and logical reasoning it seems only fair to resort to the same method of debate. </p>
<p>Since it is "common sense" that masks work, then why in the 16 months since the start of this pandemic there is no data to actually <strong>quantify</strong> the effects of non pharmaceutical intervention. </p>
<p>As we can almost all agree, any action an individual makes has some impact on those exposed to their actions. Some are positive, some are negative, often times most are negligible. </p>
<p>What I believe is important to know for the health of society at large: what level of risk is acceptable?</p>
<p>The most glaringly obvious example that comes to mind is driving an automobile. For every "little" trip we make in our vehicle, we are taking a risk. In the event of an accident, death and permanent disability are a possibility. Not just to the person taking the risk by driving but other unwilling participants (pedestrians, street maintenance crews, etc.) In this example we as a society deem the risk to be worth the reward.</p>
<p>Furthermore for the case of driving there is ample data to <strong>quantify</strong> mortality rates for automobile usage. In some regions even down to the municipality. Most people accept the risk blindly.</p>
<p>People are allowed to engage in activities that present a quantifiable risk to the willing and unwilling participants. </p>
<p>So back to lockdowns and masks; it is "<em>obvious</em>" that not leaving your home and wearing masks will prevent the spread of a communicable disease. Is that proof or just conjecture?</p>
<p>Without the resources to conduct my own quantitative study on the impact of NPI's, I am left only to my own conjecture and logical reasoning. </p>
<p>I really want to understand what other people consider an emergency. A friend of mine having a heart attack is an emergency for me, not for society. A slightly higher the average death rate is an emergency for the family of the people who are dying; not necessarily all of society</p>
<p>In my opinion for any government to declare a state of emergency it should be reasonable to assume that an emergency should be visible. Its impact is on the society locally or at large.</p>
<p>So lets find the emergency?</p>
<p>I myself never stopped working through the lockdowns and shelter in place orders. I was deemed essential. However my industry is not open to the public exposure so not exactly a breeding ground for covid. However we had at least 2 waves go through our facility. We suspect a third wave but they stopped efforts to contact trace.</p>
<p>So now I've started to think of other essential workers. Most public exposed/covid exposed essential work places. Hospitals and grocery stores. Now I'm wondering if this is really an emergency to society at large. How come these industries never collapsed. I personally do not recall a single hospital or grocery store closing due to staffing concerns. I also do not remember the job fairs to replace the massive staffing shortages due to the emergency.</p>
<p>So since the most public facing industries that were not afforded the "luxury" of lockdown, did not infact collapse then what was the emergency? </p>
<p>At the very least the essential businesses did not collapse, it may be fair to argue it is due to mask wearing. The data on the efficacy of mask wearing is muddy at best. But on the basis of arguing conjecture, I can accept that perhaps masks work.</p>
<p>So if masks work than why the lockdown? The people who work in those hospitals go home to their families. The people who work in the grocery store go home to their families. Their families likely work in other jobs in the community. Doesn't sound like it limited spread to me...</p>
<p>I do NOT want the unelected "<em>experts</em>" to decide societies risk/benefits threshold. We as thinking members of society have a responsibility to be involved in decisions that shape the way we conduct ourselves. We cannot allow the government to act as our guardian. </p>
<p>We are intelligent thinking members of society and it is our <strong>responsibility</strong> to be critical of any government action done for our own good. I never elected a babysitter, did you? I do not trust they have my best interests in mind when making policy. <strong>ANY</strong> action made by the government to restrict the freedom of others should NEVER be celebrated, it should be scrutinized with absolute disgust and disdain. </p>
<p>Rights do not come without responsibility. We the people cannot be complacent. We must be skeptical anytime the government is perceived to over step its bounds.</p>
<p>My government has decided who is allowed to do business and who isnt. Whos livelihoods are expendable. They have conditioned people to treat others as if they are lepers despite there being <strong>NO</strong> social collapse. They have decided all this for "The Greater Good"</p>
<p>We have a responsibility to ensure the Greater Good is for our neighborhoods, our cities, for our fellowman. (The greater good is not the revenue of amazon, walmart or pfizer)</p>
<p>Finally, most people are familiar with the concept that when at sea if the ship is sinking the first on the life rafts are women and children. This is not arbitrary! As a society we have always prioritized for the future generations. </p>
<p>Again it is our Responsibility to ensure the future of society.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with a lot of this but here in lies the problem.</p>
<p>You are fighting propaganda and emotional responses with logic.</p>
<p>These people are reacting to their emotions. Nobody is logically coming to the conclusion that they should wear a mask. They are either scared or the ones who aren’t are just conforming to peer pressure or complying to do whatever it is they want to do. Combating this with logic just doesn’t work when they are not thinking critically to begin with</p>

        <p>Exactly. As anyone who has bothered to conjure the patience to deal with the trolls that come in here can tell you, they are impervious to facts, logic or reason. </p>
<p>There is nothing on earth that will convince them they've been lied to. Fauci could come out tomorrow and say they made the whole thing up, and at least 99.8% of these Doomers will say he's just lying now.</p>

        <p>I honestly fear that may be true. The propaganda machine seems to have been working overtime the past couple years. I bought in to it 100% hook line and sinker. That is till the vaccine... Thats a hard no from me. Thank my lucky stars that woke me up before it was too late</p>

        <p>When ever I try to discuss it with people. They act like I want people to die. </p>
<p>When infact, I really just want to go back to a time when people didn't treat me like a leper and I didnt have the government boot on my neck. </p>
<p>I miss not worring about some bullshit chaos theory butterfly effect where I may have caught something that maybe was passed on to some one who maybe died. Its honestly sounding more like government propaganda than a pandemic. Beware of your neighbor the invisible boogie man may haunt you. </p>
<p>Like seriously do people not remember flu season? When people looked sick I stayed away from them best I could. I never shamed them on how I might catch it and pass it on to my mom who is going to give it to my grandmother and she might die. I feel like the world has gone completely crazy.</p>

        <p>That’s how you know it’s propaganda. By their own logic they didn’t care about their grandma their entire lives. Now all of a sudden they do...because someone told them to</p>
