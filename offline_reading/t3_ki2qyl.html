        <p>This is also what a doctor at Maimonides hospital in NYC presented on YouTube at the outset of the pandemic. He indicated that the ventilators were not helping and in fact killing patients. The oxygen deficiency was in respect of the oxygenation of the blood,not reduced lung power. He was removed from COVID duty.</p>

        <p>What is the difference here? How would you treat oxygen deficiency not due to diminishment of lung power differently?</p>
<p>If this is true then I am going to be extremely PO'd that the hospital when my mother got CoVid-19 basically made me kill my mother by insisting she be ventilated.</p>

        <p>Think of a balloon being pumped past capacity, there's no where for that air to go. During pneumonia, the alveoli aka air sacs in your lungs are inflamed, filled with puss and fluid and can't absorb oxygen worth a damn. </p>
<p>So they were forcing oxygen into a space that couldn't absorb it and suffocating people to death because they could get any air at all due to at capacity lungs.  They knew from the beginning that treating pneumonia with a ventilator is a death sentence, it all stinks right from the beginning and hasn't stopped.</p>

        <p>When this started, I searched on Google and found peer reviewed articles written way before this year stating that vents were the worst for treating pneumonia.  Then those articles became harder and harder to find.  This was all about Medicaid money and padding death counts.  Hospitals were paid Medicaid money for each patient they put on a vent.  Then they cancelled elective surgeries so that hospitals only had Covid patients or no income.</p>

        <p>...this doesn't actually answer the question at all, and it contains outright lies.</p>
<p>Treating severe pneumonia in patients at risk of ventilatory collapse with mechanical ventilation is standard of care because it's the only option we have, and it saves lives.</p>
<p>The question with COVID early on was the role of early vs. standard mechanical ventilation procedures.  Initially, reports indicated that rapid progression to ventilatory collapse in COVID-19 supported an early ventilation strategy.  Ultimately, that proved untrue, and we returned to standard ventilation indications.</p>
<p>We still use ventilators, and they still save lives.</p>

        <p>providing simple oxygen ( the kind like you would see someone walking around with an oxygen tank) and putting the patient in a prone position so it would be easier to breathe was found to be the best treatment, and this was known at the onset of the American epidemic. That oxygen is just breathed in, there is no pumping or forcing of the lungs involved, and no inserting tubes. Also, people on ventilators are then given many other drugs including ones that make keep unconsciouss. Those drugs themselves also cause problems, and arent needed with just simple oxygen administration. </p>

        <p>Oh, you're the covid killed my parents guy.  Well, if you're not actually lying, then it really sucks that your mum was likely killed by the ventilator.  They hardly use them to treat covid nowadays and usually just use oxygen via a nasal canula, which is much less invasive and has much better outcomes for patients.  You will also find that for SARS (the first one), they stopped using ventilators for the very reason that it appeared to have far worse outcomes, the same in the case of pneumonia.  I'm not lying to you, I just want you to know the truth, you can find all this information yourself easily. </p>
<p>A lot of nurses, who were already panicking, were operating ventilators without the right training which resulted in many unnecessary deaths due to ventilation especially in some of the 'covid death hotspots' like NY and Italy.</p>

        <p>I find it weird when they're removing doctors like this who have differing options from the official narratives. Covid is a new condition after all and throughout history certain conditions were treated badly and management of these conditions changed.

        <p>There is also the Floridian nurse who was sent to NY to work and told us this was happening, actually multiple, I believe there were at least 2, but one did a big interview with Journeyman Pictures about it (no idea if it is still on YouTube).

<p>A family member of mine was a doctor who worked treating COVID-19 patients, and he got himself infected, and was basically killed by non well trained staff.</p>
<p>People who really didn't need it got intubated, and people without any experience were doing the intubations because "unprecedented times".</p>

        <p>I remember my dad telling me this at the very beginning.  He and other doctors at his hospital in NYC knew that the negative pressure applied when people come off the ventilator was completely inappropriate, even dangerous, for lungs weakened by covid.</p>

        <p>Ventilators literally damage the lungs and are used as a last resort when needed. At the beginning of the pandemic if you were hospitalized with severe covid you were instantly put on a ventilator as it was the prescribed treatment. There was nothing else. My country bought $20million worth of ventilators that were never used on the back of this "advice". Doctors knew the risk but did what they were told.</p>

        <p>&rt; Doctors knew the risk but did what they were told. </p>
<p>That's the number one problem in this crisis. Many of today's doctors are completely complacent and cowardly, they do the job just for the cash and status, they don't want to make any call, they just follow the protocol. What happens when the protocol is shit and kills people? They follow the protocol. As long as every doctor follows the same protocol, you can't hold any individual doctor responsible for this malpractice "but everyone was doing it!" IS an effective defense.</p>
<p>I brought up the problem of this killer protocol with someone who worked in the medical industry, and pointed out the first doctors that called it out as atrociously inappropriate faced administrative punishment for it and censorship... his reply? "A doctor that doesn't follow protocol? He SHOULD be fired!". I had to remind him we now know that fucking protocol killed people and that their courageous stand saved lives in the end to embarrass him over his rote authoritarianism.</p>
