    <strong>COVID vaccine and DNA altering</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen several mentions that the COVID vaccine changes your DNA and makes you more of a hybrid that allows you to be controlled without even knowing it.  I'm seeing more and more hostility in the world (in person and online) to people who don't want the vaccine from vaccinated people.  This would seem to make sense if they have now been hijacked like the Borg from Star Trek.  </p>
<p>What's everyone's thoughts on this?</p>
<p>I think non-vaccinated people need to start pretending they got vaccinated.  Until we can somehow group together in a trusted resistance.  You cannot trust vaccinated people -- even if they are family!  I've seen newly vaccinated people outcasting their own family because they won't get vaccinated.  This fits in with the thinking that they are now hybrids and not able to control their own thoughts and feelings.</p></p>

        <p>It's also likely that people need to defend their life decisions. It would be psychologically ruinous if you make bad life choices and then one day wake up and realize just how much past you screwed present or future you. How do you avoid this trauma? You double down on your decisions, defending them until your last breath. After all, the narrative says you did what you were supposed to. So clearly you were morally justified in your decisions.</p>

<p>This is conspiracy nonsense. Besides, they’ve proven they don’t need to alter DNA to get compliance, look at the world over the last year.</p>
<p>Having said that, I’m not getting the shot. I don’t see a need for it personally. I’ve never even had a flu shot. I did have the usual (and more, Air Force) vaccines growing up though.</p>
