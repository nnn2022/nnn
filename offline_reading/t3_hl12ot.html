    <strong>Sick until proven healthy! Guilty until proven innocent! Not respectable until proven worthy.</strong>
    <p><p>I posted this in the main conoravirus sub the other day and it was <em>upvoted</em>. I was trying to show how absurd they were being and it was fucking upvoted! </p>
<p>In my country, we’re innocent until proven guilty, that’s like the basis of our justice system. And I’ve always believed all people are worthy of respect, and we should treat everyone with respect, unless they give us reason not to. The other way around of presuming the worst of people until they “prove” themselves just seems like such a vicious and abusive way to view the world. </p>
<p>I guess a lot of the rona folks really do see the world that way. Which is sad because it means they do not believe in their own innate value, they look for validation outside the self, and therefore “protecting others” to them has become a sacred way to “achieve” worthiness as a human being.</p>
<p>It’s an empty achievement, however, and that’s why these mandates keep getting stricter, they’re desperately trying to fight the “not good enough” frame of mind, a constantly moving goalpost, and recreate the dopamine hit of feeling morally superior and momentarily worthy.</p></p>

        <p>Sick until proven healthy was my number one thought before the lockdowns. </p>
<p>I was disturbed at how proud everyone was to assume they themselves were pratically walking lethal weapons, and they were saving lives by wearing a mask.</p>
