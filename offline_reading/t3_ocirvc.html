        <p>At the least, simply support the privacy and human rights of the individual, and remind  businesses that 'property law' is about defending their rights to 'usage' of the property , and not as a license to IMPOSE their fears, suspicion (and of course political goals) on anyone else.</p>
<p>For example, now that Mask mandates have been removed, that businesses are not allowed to continue to post Medical requirements on their windows.</p>
<p>It still maintains their right 'to refuse service for any reason' but it removes at least that excuse, and they have less ability to rationalize imposing it on their customers, or continuing with their medical interrogation of same.</p>

        <p>Yep, if the covid vaccine was anything else it would have been pulled from sale. </p>
<p>In the 70s swine flu vaccine was recalled after 24 deaths, now we got about 20,000 combined deaths in Europe and USA. But the magic of no-liability shines like the sun, and we can behold what companies can do when there are no consequences.</p>

        <p>It killed my beloved boss. He was 80, yes but just had a perfect health checkup and came to the office every day. Couldn’t keep him away. He got the vaccine and 2 weeks later dead. Heart attack and blood clots. I’m so pissed. He was a fantastic man. Sorry about your mom I hope she is ok.</p>

        <p>Pepperidge Farm remembers.</p>
<p>Two previous studies found that between 90% and 99% percent of vaccine reactions go unreported to VAERS. When I looked through my documents I found that the ER doctor failed to report my vaccine reaction, and i was unable to do it myself because at the time I couldn't submit the form without adding arbitrary information. (Such as the physician license number of the doctor who gave me the vaccine, impossible since it wasn't administered by a doctor) so there, I'm in that 99% unreported reaction category too.</p>

<p>Since when are we 'sick until proven healthy'?  </p>
<p>In the past in our medical history, people couldn't label you as dangerous, or infectious, or 'danger to others' without a doctor getting a court order against you, then you could legally be detained in an institution or simply ordered to stay at home..</p>
<p>Now we're supporting these measures and discrimination based only on FEAR and SUSPICION, and DISCRIMINATING against people.</p>

        <p>Nope. I don’t inherently believe you’re sick even if I know you don’t have the vaccine, but I can’t trust that that will always be the case because every day is different.</p>
<p>It’s not about thinking you’re sick, it’s about protecting people.</p>
<p>Look at it like this; if a car is driving erratically I’m not gonna immediately assume that the driver is under the influence, but I am going to get the hell away from them and probably contact the authorities in order to protect both the driver and anyone else around them. </p>
<p>In that example Covid is the car(the threat that could lead to many deaths) and the authorities are the shot(that which attempts to stop the situation before anyone gets hurt, although it may not be able to 100% stop the threat).</p>

        <p>Why is it always car analogies..? Either way, my girlfriend and me have one in a million chance of dying from covid. We've both had it, it's clearly not that dangerous. </p>
<p>And before you say, that I'm not at risk - which is true, I'm not - why should I get this "vaccine" again? Even the day-long pain the arm that literally everyone gets makes it not worth it to me.</p>
<p>"It's not about you, it's about those at risk." Firstly, they're free to get the shot, have been for a long time. Secondly, I'm not entirely convinced it's that dangerous to them either.</p>
<p>I was quite worried, when my grandfather, a 75 year old man, who's overweight and missing a piece of his lung, caught covid. He got prescribed isoprinosine, and had a temperature a bit over 38°C for two days. He was mostly annoyed that he couldn't go shopping for two weeks.</p>

        <p>You’re right you aren’t crying about your arm hurting, you’re crying about your arm getting hurt which is even funnier. </p>
<p>And as for the rest of your “argument” you don’t have any. Literally all you said was “people that are at risk can get the vaccine I won’t stop them even if I don’t believe they’re at risk.” And “My grandfather was okay afterwards even though he had pre-existing conditions.”</p>
<p>What exactly am I supposed to argue against? Do you want me to argue that there are people that are at risk or that your grandfather actually isn’t okay/didn’t actually get Covid? What am I supposed to have an opinion about there? </p>
<p>If you don’t believe that there actually are at-risk people I can’t definitively prove that to you, especially not over Reddit. </p>
<p>And I can’t say anything about your grandfather because I don’t know him, so what exactly could I say lol?</p>

        <p>That's because you have nothing to say, so you just resort to insults. You're the one trying to sell a potentially harmful solution to a problem that many people don't and never might encounter.</p>
<p>I know there are people at-risk, I know several nurses, one of which worked at a covid ward - I know what the virus can do, and I know what the "vaccine" can do. </p>
<p>My grandfather is just one example out of a dozen people people from those at-risk groups that I personally know.</p>
<p>Either way, all you managed to do was insult and appeal to emotions, that is not a good way to sell, covid should fire you from its marketing team.</p>

        <p>I have nothing to say because you said nothing with that I could give a response to and this comment just further proves that lol.</p>
<p>Both of the other “arguments” that I “ignored” in your first comment to me weren’t arguments they were statements. </p>
<p>&rt; And before you say, that I'm not at risk - which is true, I'm not - why should I get this "vaccine" again? Even the day-long pain the arm that literally everyone gets makes it not worth it to me.</p>
<p>This is the part of your comment I replied to. </p>
<p>&rt;”It's not about you, it's about those at risk." Firstly, they're free to get the shot, have been for a long time. Secondly, I'm not entirely convinced it's that dangerous to them either.</p>
<p>“At risk people can get the shot to protect themselves, though I don’t believe it’s necessary for them to.”</p>
<p>What can I say to that it’s just a statement. It’s not like you actually started a fact or something I could try and actually disprove with evidence. That would be like trying to change someone’s feelings on how grass feels or how they feel about cold weather. </p>
<p>&rt;I was quite worried, when my grandfather, a 75 year old man, who's overweight and missing a piece of his lung, caught covid. He got prescribed isoprinosine, and had a temperature a bit over 38°C for two days. He was mostly annoyed that he couldn't go shopping for two weeks.</p>
<p>“My grandfather had issues and then got Covid and he’s fine.”</p>
<p>This is another nothing statement that I literally cannot make any arguments or responses to. Your granddad has medical issues, got Covid, doesn’t seem worse for wear…good for you…? Like what exactly do you want me to say in response?</p>

        <p>we have plenty of reason to assume these "0.0018% risk of vaccine death or the 0.0003% risk of blood clot" percentages are dead wrong. major giveaway at first was that these were numbers supplied by the producers of the vaccines, not unbiased institutions, the same corporations who """magically""" and """accidentally""" lost a whopping 3000 entries from their test studies.</p>

        <p>What you are describing is 'defensive driving', something that you and I and everyone else on the road should do.. Because you can't assume that others will follow road rules, or be attentive at all times, so you must be prepared.</p>
<p>But notice one thing: It is DEFENSIVE in nature. <strong>It is you and I taking responsibility for ourselves</strong>, being proactive and attentive so that we can protect ourselves and get home safe.</p>
<p>Most importantly of all, <strong>we don't need to IMPOSE our will upon others in the process.</strong></p>
<p>So if we take the same analogy and apply it to your fears (outside a real emergency threat), then you would 'defensively' and 'proactively' and 'attentively' protect yourself adequately to allay those fears.</p>
<p>Much like the defensive driving, you would take responsibility to wear proper PPE against a 'highly contagious airborne killer virus variant', or you would avoid places that you felt put you at high risk.</p>
<p>WCB(Canada) and OSHA(USA) require air-sealed and filtered respiratory masks and body suits to deal with a 'highly contagious airborne killer virus variant' - a surgical mask is not sufficient.</p>
<p>Your fear may be warranted or it may not - it doesn't matter.. what is important is that you do not IMPOSE your will upon others, either personally or through proxy of the guns of the State - to ensure your own safety.</p>

        <p>You can deny science all you want. Natural immunity is superior to whatever the experimental therapy can provide without none of the risks. </p>
<p>I got covid early on, despite taking the usual precautions and stopped wearing the mask as soon as I was clear. There were no lasting effects and I've been around plenty of infected and haven't gotten sick since, proving that I am immune. I've also had antibody tests that confirm that I've had immunity to covid for over a year now. </p>
<p>I don't need or want some drug from a bunch of companies with proven histories of criminal abuse. I'm not against other vaccines, in general, but I won't be taking this one no matter how much you and every other shill here begs.</p>

        <p>There's the whataboutism. We are talking about the covid "vaccines" and the companies that made them without properly testing them for long term side effects. Stay on topic or this conversation is over.</p>

        <p>Well we’re 7 months in since the vaccines started rolling out and the only real issues have been about 1,600 people have had an allergic reaction, 39 people getting blood clots, 780 cases of heart inflammation or swelling, and 5,718 deaths in total or about 0.0018% of all people that have gotten vaccinated. </p>
<p>Now I’m not saying that those numbers are perfect or anything, but compared to the over 600 <em>thousand</em> deaths caused by Covid in the us in only a little bit more of an amount of time I think that the risks from <em>not</em> getting the vaccine seriously outweigh the risks from getting it.</p>

        <p>I already told you I got it and it was just another cold and I already told you that I'm not getting the vaccine. You don't listen very well and you are literally wasting your time regurgitating old talking points that accomplish nothing besides some lame attempt at manipulating emotions.</p>
<p>As for "mUh 600 gOrIlLiOn", the numbers are inflated in order to sell the largest wealth transfer in the history of this country. Most of those died <em>with</em> covid. Only a small percentage actually died <em>from</em> covid, according to the CDC.</p>

        <p>Not caused BY covid, most deaths are 'involving' covid.</p>
<p>what does the CDC have to say?</p>

<p>#1 Influenza (the flu) and pneumonia</p>
<p>#2 Respiratory failure</p>
<p>#3 Hypertensive diseases</p>
<p>#4 Diabetes</p>
<p>"For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death."- CDC</p>

        <p>There are overt things, and far more subtle things. Consider the way they teach mathematics to children. Every generation or so, they strip down the whole thing and teach it in a different way, to the point where parents can't help their children with their homework. So what, right? Math is a universal language. This is basically the "Tower of Babel" tactic, meant to confuse the people so they can't work together. Just one of the many things that, as you say, "has always been the case". But some people get indoctrinated too young to know what's going on.</p>

        <p>Also, Cowboys and Indians. One generation taught to revere Cowboys and their use of force against hostile Native American Indians; the next few generations solely taught about the evils and injustices against Native American Indians by "the white man". Both make legitimate points and are accurate portrayals of history, however the intended feeling toward either party has totally flipped, and neither were taught much in-between nor balanced approaches. The end result is vilifying one of the two parties, while talking about a 400+ year history over a large geographical territory.</p>

        <p>Thanks for caring :)</p>
<p>Well I did indeed spend the night at home. Lying down in bed seemed to help, some twinges but not so bad I think. This morning woke up (that's a good sign!) and just laid there for a while... no twinging. Cool. Since then have got up and fiddled around as normal on a Sunday and definitely some pain, palpitations and general unease; there's something wrong with my heart. For sure.</p>
<p>I was hoping it was maybe just anxiety but I actually feel a lot calmer now, while the symptoms are actually scarier.</p>

        <p>Nother update...</p>
<p>Went to gov' hospital. After a lot of tests and messing around, bottom line seems I have an inflamed heart but no actual long-term damage, should resolve itself over time, and to take things easy.</p>
<p>Literally found the lady beside me was there for the exact same symptoms, right arm went numb, heart palpitations and pain, breathless etc. She got exact same diagnosis, just go home and wait.</p>
<p>It was bizarre how the docs tried to downplay any connection to the vaccine, and we're like pointing at the other person with the exact same symptoms from the same damn injection. Clown world.</p>
<p>Asking so many silly questions about anything and everything EXCEPT the vaccine. Finally he lets slip they are seeing many people with same symptoms after vaccine?? Well hello? Maybe it's the fucking vaccine? </p>
<p>He's like "Well the symptoms are vague, pains in chest, numbness, cannot really say what it is"</p>
<p>Yeah we can, we can say it's the fucking vaccines! </p>
<p>And then he was suggesting I still get the 2nd one?</p>
<p>"Oh I know, how about fuck off?"</p>
<p>Jeez</p>

        <p>Younger gen z, and god help gen alpha, has no idea what the internet used to be. All they know is corporate monetization and letting others become rich off of you and your unique characteristics that make you who you are. Notice how my generation is obsessed with oversharing their lives and everything that's happened to them on the internet, specifically TikTok? It's not a coincidence. This data is precious. It's you, your time, your money. If an AI has a better understanding of your past and your current mental state, it will paint a decent picture of future you. We are all being molded and shaped in ways we can't bend. We will find ourselves broken and only they will "know" how to put us back together, but this time how they want.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aH4WUXVfNj0">This documentary is a good watch.</a></p>
<p>Forgot to mention I am an older gen z, born in '98. I want to help my generation but I have no idea where to start. Maybe philosophy but so many people have been broken down nothing I say would mean anything and I'm probably just mentally ill and not smart at all lol.</p>

        <p>ok so let's crack some numbers, 183 million cases and 3.96 millions deaths. that's a death chance if you catch it of 2.16%. 860 million people have been full vaccinated, if we use the same 2.16% chance then from the vaccine over 18.5million people would have died for the vaccine for it not to be worth it and it would be costing lives. you guys are all dumb as fuck and it shows. the vaccine has saved lives and id guarantee some of you haven't had covid because of the vaccinated people and people who followed the rules. i hate the people that say 2% of people isn't that much. selfish bastards im so glad i live in NZ and we got rid of it. i hope you know you're personally making this last longer over your fear of needles.</p>

        <p>oh wow i hadn't looked at solely the US of A. those are some impressive numbers guys i didn't think it could possibly be that high. ok though i should have assumed I was talking to an American being on this subredit, so I'll just use your numbers. 605,000 people have died of covid in the USA. 54% of your population has been fully vaccinated. that's 183 million people. how many deaths from the vaccine? 5,718 reports that could be associated to the vaccine, of 324 million doses worldwide. almost all cases and deaths now coming out of the USA now are unvaccinated people. I'm just saying if you're specifically talking about death you can put it up to numbers and what's better to survive. it's safer to be vaccinated, you're all just scared because its unknown and needles are sharp, you have to walk in go get a vaccine. you don't have to do anything to catch covid and just pray i don't die i guess. or give it to my family and they die. that's what I couldn't deal with, if i caught it and killed my nana when I could have been vaccinated.</p>

<p>That’s absurd. If that’s the case than shouldn’t we apply that to everything else too? Laws, safety requirements, other vaccines, etc?</p>
<p>The world would implode if we followed that logic with everything, people would be dying in even bigger droves than they were last year. Not just because of Corona but because there’d be complete anarchy in the streets and no way to stop it.</p>

        <p>But your argument is that “everything could kill you so why be afraid of x thing.” If you applied that to something like traffic laws than you’d have people driving on the sidewalks, blowing through stop signs and traffic lights, playing on their phones, getting behind the wheel under the influence, etc. People would die in bigger numbers so how does that make sense?</p>
<p>If the logic is “don’t worry about getting the vaccine because Covid isn’t that big of a threat.” How’s that’s different than “don’t worry about following the road laws because being hit by a car isn’t that big of a threat.”…?</p>

        <p>I think your analogy was well off the mark. Are you advocating people be fearful of more things? I'm advocating for less. </p>
<p>Did we freak out over the common cold...ever? If Delta is producing similar symptoms why should we freak out? Because it's called COVID? No. This is the same mistake and trap fallen into with the word...vaccine.  You have to look at each iteration and judge it on its merits. You don't. You conflate. That is wrong methodology.</p>
<p>I believe EVERYTHING in life requires what I term: referendum thinking. You can't link ANY viewpoint with any other. Each is independent and requires it's own "Trial" in your mind, if you will.</p>
<p>That is why I'm apolitical. I couldn't care less about all the labels and what they stand for. People on both sides disgust me. Nobody thinks any of these political parties are right about everything but many can't wait to jump under some umbrella of either and get very tribalistic. That's idiotic. I assume this is what you do but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Think about each and every detail of everything with a referendum mindset. It will change your life.</p>

        <p>I’m pro-regulation. Things that need oversight and major control for the betterment of society and the future of our planet need regulations. Without regulations people get hurt and die in severely preventable ways. </p>
<p>The common cold has nowhere near the death toll throughout its entirely known existence that Covid-19 has had in just the ~2 years we’ve been dealing with it. The highest estimate that the WHO has for annual deaths related to “the common cold” is about 650,000 people <em>globally</em>! Throughout the whole of 2020 Covid and Covid related issues were listed as the cause of death for 377,883 people in the <em>US ALONE</em>! That’s over half the amount of deaths in only one country compared to the whole planet, <em>that</em> is why we’re more worried about Corona than the common cold</p>

<p>What happens when you give too many vaccines to people against a pathogen? It becomes what?</p>
<p>It is YOU who is driving this stating you're doing the world a favor under the guise of being terrified and latching onto any perceived way out. Your fear caused you to abdicate your common sense and personal responsibility to understand what you were actually doing to yourself and society.</p>
<p>Oh, and you're helping the virus become vaccine resistant, as using a LEAKY vaccine instead of a STERILIZING vaccine is a BRUTAL strategy. </p>
<p>Now, you have TWO risks as people who've taken the vax still get sick and still die. And, you get the 2nd risk of side effects now and long term. What will happen 2 years from now?  You don't know. I know that I have the ONE risk. Delta? I think I'll be okay. Runny nose, headache and sore throat seems pretty survivable to me.</p>

And yes we know what will happen 2 years from because this is an inactivated vaccine (at least the moderna I got is) and it literally CANT effect me later.  The delta variant can only evolve IF theres people who are unvaccinated for it to evolve in.  But then it can be stronger due to the vaccinated people.</p>

<p>Another statement by you that is verifiably false. People have gotten myocarditis, Bell's palsy, and have died. </p>

        <p>EVERYONE has lost something. EVERYONE. I'm very sorry you lost people you love.  I've lost more to cancer than you have but cancer isn't in the news 24/7. </p>

<p>You are really washed upstairs if you believe there is no possible effect from mRNA for the long term. It might be the most ridiculous thing I've heard, because you know what? NOBODY knows what will happen. NOBODY. </p>
<p>Read the study I shared. Then, I would suggest understanding Marek's disease. </p>
<p>You haven't learned a lot. Perhaps, a a lot for YOU, but not a lot generally speaking. </p>
<p>The fact you posted what you have is a very good indication you don't know what you think you know. List for me the ingredients in the Moderna vaccine and explain to me the effect of each on your body NOW and down the road. What is SM-102? What does it do to your body? Tell me. </p>
<p>I'd love to be in sales, if I got to have people like you as customers. Like shooting fish in a barrel. The TV told me this, and I believe it! </p>
<p>You should realize what is happening in the data from the UK. The vaccine ain't looking so good about now. All that really matters, though, is that you FEEL protected and like you did the right thing. Neither are true, but who can stop you?</p>

        <p>BTW, I'm not sure you have any clue what mRNA is and does. It is literally like uploading new software to your cells. Body-hacking. Do you know what your cells have been programmed to do? I know what your mind has been, but do you understand? I don't think you do. </p>
<p>This required more thought than you gave it, and I understand. I do. Fear is powerful. I feel for you. I mean that sincerely. It's just unacceptable to me to listen to people in the throes of fear who have done little study tell me how it is.</p>

        <p>You really are one of those basement dwellers who thinks they're the smartest thing in the world.  I read the article, and it suffers from the same thing you keep trying to bring up where   there's uncertainty.  The only vaccine that has had real issues is the j&amp;j.  Vaccines are not new science.  This is an adaptation to a known formula.  </p>
<p>I have multiple friends who are immunologists. This isn't fairy tails, this is science and life.  I bet you deny climate change too.  Christ almighty people like you are why this world is going to shit.</p>
<p>And yes I lost people, from something that is now preventable, but not getting vaccinated keeps it from that.  At least 2nd hand smoke you can clearly see when it would affect you, this you cant.</p>

        <p>You have an alternative. HIDE. Stay inside all day and don't interact with fellow humans. Learn to see others as the merchants and orchestrators of your death. You have the right. Just hide. Be scared. </p>
<p>I'm not doing that. That is DEATH. I don't do anything differently right now. Delta is no threat to me. The people who believe they're vulnerable should take whatever precautions they feel they need to. </p>
<p>I don't need to live in fear, wear a mask and take experimental gene therapy to feel better about who I am. I would feel worse if I did that. </p>
<p>Again, I get the fear especially given you've lost loved ones which is horrific. I've lost people to cancer. Several. Some in my cancer circle. I'm a survivor. I don't live in fear of cancer having already had it and seen my close friends in my circle die with it. Perhaps, some survivor's guilt, but not fear. You have to live. </p>
<p>This is exactly what will  happen in America and globally. We will live with this so we should've been practicing from the outset. We don't have the ability to come up with a sterilizing vaccine for this, and we knew that before we started. To ramrod EVERYONE MUST TAKE THE VACCINE is just plain silly and dangerous. </p>
<p>You are the risk taker between us. You assumed TWO. I assumed ONE. </p>
<p>We shall see how it works out. Stay safe. Hide if you need to.</p>

        <p>Your not very good liar considering 2 people in the US total have died from the vaccine and both didn't follow procedures from the 30 minute holding period and had anaphylaxis.  So the lockdown measures wouldn't have been needed for more than 2 weeks if people actually locked down appropriately, and if you lost friends to it itnwould be due to the nation's improper response unless they took their own lives which that has other issues.</p>

Not injecting myself with god knows what for something that supposedly kills .25% of the population and the makers of the vaccine can’t be held accountable for vaccine injuries from their product.

<p>You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.</p>
<p>Do you have a degree in that field?</p>
<p>A college degree? In that field?</p>
<p>Then your arguments are invalid.</p>
<p>No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.</p>
<p>Correlation does not equal causation.</p>
<p>CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.</p>
<p>You still haven't provided me a valid source yet.</p>
<p>Nope, still haven't.</p>
<p>I just looked through all 308 pages of your user history, figures I'm debating a glormpf supporter. A moron.</p>
