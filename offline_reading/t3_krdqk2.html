    <strong>Please stop the unfounded conspiracies, they do not help us.</strong>
    <p><p>Don't get me wrong, I agree that you have a freedom of speech right, and you can talk about whatever you want to talk, that's not what I'm saying here.</p>
<p>What I'm saying here is, unfounded conspiracies, meaning, extrapolations of real things to some theory without actual facts, makes the claims less palatable to most people.</p>
<p>I'm going to be honest, I'm 100% against lockdowns and most of the restrictions being put in place, and I do think they are an obvious power grab by the political class.</p>
<p>But when I see posts extrapolating that to the foundation of the NWO, to be honest I just roll my eyes. </p>
<p>Once again, I do believe politicians love the power they have right now, and they are just plainly abusing it for their own good... but extrapolating that to something more "evil" or ominous is really unnecessary.</p>
<p>I mean, to be completely honest, we do not need a NWO conspiracy theory to see that basic human rights are being violated at an unprecedented scale, and that the cost of what is going on right now will take generations to be fully understood.</p>
<p>Skepticism for a vaccine that basically was developed in less than half the usual time, with questionable reliability and safety concerns is good, specially since regardless of safety most people should not use a vaccine for something that they are really not at risk.</p>
<p>But extrapolating this to a conspiracy about vaccines either being developed for a nefarious reason is just unnecessary, unfounded and it doesn't help the case to push back against the tyranny we are experiencing right now.</p>
<p>Unlike them, I think we do need to use good evidence and arguments, to push harder than the doomers could ever have.</p></p>

        <p>The WEF is a cesspool of politicians, rich people and their friends pushing for more cronyism and wanting to control as much as they can.</p>
<p>Of course they will try to use this to push more of their agenda, and of course they don't give a fuck.</p>
<p>Once again, I'm not saying that isn't true, I'm saying it is one thing to say that the WEF is making use of this to push their agenda to saying that this was a "planed pandemic", and then leap to some very stupid conspiracy theories like saying that SARS-CoV-2 has never been found (it has).</p>

        <p>Yes, COVID even was found in Avocado, you know, with those awesome PCR tests.</p>
<p>Also Koch's Postulate hasn't been done for COVID.</p>
<p>So I dunno, everything seems fishy, not to mention complete and total lack of the flu statistics.</p>

        <p>Nope, I'm not talking about PCR tests, which are being misused and mishandled, which makes me even angrier because PCR tests aren't supposed to be used like this. I'm talking that even thou I've seen many times in this subreddit talking about how the virus has never been isolated, that is just a pure lie, the virus has been isolated, many times.</p>
<p>Don't act like the guys you hate.</p>
<p>Lack of flu statistics is extremely easily explained. Nothing is considered to be the flu now. Normally, most flu cases are just diagnosed, but because of health guidelines right now diagnosing isn't good enough, and people who otherwise would be diagnosed as having the flu will be fall into the "probable covid" category, being given a PCR test, and if it comes back negative, they will be just dismissed, not falling into any flu diagnosis.</p>
<p>The only numbers of flu diagnosis are the worst ones, in cases where there was an actual flu test and came back positive, which is not standard procedure anymore, so people who die with the flu but never had a test done, will no longer count as flu, even if they would in any other time in the past.</p>
<p>Not to mention that people are just avoiding clinics and hospitals.</p>

        <p>Koch's postulates are the following: The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms. The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.</p>
<p>Hasn't been done, even Chinese said it hasn't. But hey, should find those Chinese docs on the web if you really care, I don't.</p>

        <p>Koch's postulates are actually pretty difficult to fulfill, and there are MANY illnesses that have an accepted infectious agent, but have never fulfilled Koch's postulates.</p>
<p>Koch's postulates are actually good for historical reference on the field of epidemiology, but in the modern world they aren't the golden standard to show causality.</p>
<p>It isn't "convenient", it is just stupid. Basically people are in stupid mode</p>

        <p>This is valid and the some of the over the top stuff probably isn't that helpful but at the same time this is a congregating place for many varieties of people.  Just like I'm sure r/Coronavirus has some level headed analytical people I know for a fact it's got some very very silly people as well.</p>
<p>And when you say nefarious reasons for developing the vaccine, well, I would tend to agree that I don't think it was developed to cull the population or commit a subtle genocide.  However, I do think a lot of it has to do with money.  Money over lives, money over safety, money over it's purported purpose which is public health.  So to that extent it is nefarious.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. I'm not talking about the fact that people are exploiting this for their own good, they obviously are, I'm talking about talking about some very complex conspiracy going on here.</p>
<p>Sadly, and I do mean sadly, if anything this has shown just how stupid people are, and the fact that without any conspiracy going on the world can go to shit just by pure panic is way more scary in my point of view.</p>

        <p>The whole NWO conspiracy theory started because it is exactly a phrase commonly used to talk about a change in the balance of power, because of some grandiose event.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists basically extrapolated that since everyone is using that word, there must be some nefarious deep conspiration going on.</p>
<p>So, in the end it is kind of circular logic, politicians like to use the phrase "New World Order" to talk about big changes in the world governance, which makes some people start to think it is a conspiracy theory, and after the conspiracy theory is created, if some other guy in power uses the phrase it is somehow proof of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>And to be fair, I don't want to be talking about this, this is a fucking waste of time.</p>
<p>There are obvious violations of human rights being perpetrated at a large scale, and instead of basically going taking action against it, some of you guys are more interested in how the NWO, Mummy Soros, and some other fat cat of the league of crony friends are all conspiring to destroy the world economy, which will ultimately also suck for them, but since it is all nefarious stuff, it somehow makes sense.</p>

        <p>Some people may want that, but many others don't.</p>
<p>I don't think at all there is super big evil global conspiration to create a nefarious world government.</p>
<p>Not to mention that these measures, if anything, have been against that notion. Closing borders doesn't seem very "world government" like to me.</p>

        <p>Since you are against lockdowns but feel that this has nothing to do with the NWO, what do you feel the end goal of these lockdowns are for? What are they hoping to achieve with them?</p>

        <p>There is no end goal, there is no point, it is an stupid reactive measure that politicians started to implement because of pressure to "do something", so that they do not look bad, and have morphed into an stupid sunk costs fallacy in which they just cannot stop doing it because it would mean everything that the have done until this point was in vain and they would look bad.</p>
<p>Not to mention that many politicians LOVE having extra powers.</p>

        <p>It is sad to see so many downvotes, which really make me believe that we are doomed.</p>
<p>If the people on one side are semi religious fanatics that have an obsession with some mild virus, and are willing to destroy the world to "stop it", and the people on the other side believe it all to be a NWO conspiracy to put a chip in your brain... we really are doomed.</p>
<p>Stupidity is the only human constant.</p>
