    <strong>Mask madness at work</strong>
    <p><p>I come in today and the couple ridiculous extremely pro c19 vax people are like "YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR MASK ON" to me. right,  so apparently they're cracking down on the few unvaccinated here and making us wear masks again. One guy got sent home ( a rather large guy) for not wearing one. My question is: isn't this discrimination given what the facts are and what they are basing there policy on? Which is CDC guidelines, but that say EVERYONE even vaxxed they are recommending to wear a mask. So this company is taking that recommendation and applying it to only those they don't like,  which us the unvaxxinated (and its extremely evident the owner hates us by a few emails we got.) This shit 8s ridiculous.  I respect private companies ability to mandate masks and such but what they are doing seems wrong. Seems like a shaming exercise.</p></p>

        <p>Sorry friend. Just know that we're all pretty much going through the same thing. Some worse and some better. I'm convinced that on the whole this all amounts to continued psychological torture.</p>

        <p>I'm right though right? CDC recommended guidelines are saying all people are advised to wear masks. Both vaxxed and not vaxxed. So based on the recommended safety guidelines,  the policy here is discrimination.  It's based on nothing</p>

        <p>It seems with this, you have to stand strong, and let your employer shoot themselves in the balls.  Don't comply.  Just do what you know is best for your health.  When they threaten to fire you, ignore it.  When they fire you, they'll join many other businesses dying to find good people to work for them, who can't find anyone due to their anti-human covid policies.  Let them fail, it's their choice.</p>

        <p>I am perfectly okay with them mandating a mask policy.  It's a private business and they have that right.  But what they are doing is ignoring the part of the CDC recommend guidelines that says they have to wear a mask as well, and making just us wear one because they're using it as a shame tactic. Its discrimination</p>

        <p>&rt;they're using it as a shame tactic. Its discrimination</p>
<p>I don't know how to pull this off, but the right thing to do is turn this shame around on them.  They are the ones overstepping their authority and discriminating on the basis of privileged health status.  They don't need to know, yet they insist you tell them, and then discriminate on that basis.  But vax status is not a protected class, so one has to use other tactics.  One route could be a religious exemption, and then accuse them of discrimination based on religion.  They are forcing you to act like a member of their Cult Of Science would do, but you're not in that cult.</p>

        <p>Yeah.  Well put. Thank you for your input.  Its incredibly fucked up. Really is. I want to go to the owner and ask him if I put together a presentation, if he would listen to it. I feel like he had never heard the opposition. Maybe he would listen?</p>

        <p>I thought HIPPA protected personal medical information especiallyon proving you are/are not vaxxxed, hopefully someone who knows more can step in here.</p>

        <p>Just nutshelling here but in this context all HIPPA does is prevent your doctor from releasing your personal healthcare information to anyone without your consent.</p>
<p>You employer can still <strong>ask</strong> you if your vaccinated but they cannot ask your doctor. It's up to you to answer.</p>

        <p>I can post the letter. They are saying unless you provide that information (proof of vax) then you have to wear a mask. CDC is recommended everyone where a mask so I'm calling this discrimination.  But yeah we got a email where that was a check yes or no if you are vaxxed and I just didn't reply. Lol don't have to</p>

        <p>I found wearing sunglasses with a mask is very off-putting for conversations and is now my default when asked to wear a mask.   It's like talking to someone on the other side of a bathroom stall.  The authoritarians aren't the only ones that get to play at psyops.</p>
