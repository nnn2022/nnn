    <strong>Caring about the economy does not equate to greed</strong>
    <p><p>Ever since COVID-19 began to spread, people who have raised concerns about the economy have been silenced with prejudice: “how dare you put money before human lives?” they’ll say.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, though: money is the reason I didn’t starve today. Money is the reason I’m living in a warm apartment instead of on the streets. When I meet people who <em>do</em> live on the streets, they don’t ask me for hugs; they don’t ask for socks or shoes. They ask for money, because they know money is their best chance at getting a meal (or drugs, but that’s besides the point).</p>
<p>Caring about money, the flow of money and the value of money at any given time does not equate to greed, or putting material possessions before human lives. It is merely to recognize that people have material needs which are met by money, and if money goes down the tubes, most of the people in our society are going to be royally screwed.</p>
<p>The truth is, rich and privileged people are the only ones who can afford to not care about money. Anyone with a genuine shred of compassion and understanding in their hearts should be concerned about the fact that thousands of small businesses throughout the country have permanently closed.</p></p>

        <p>Only because of our insistence on capitalism to excess.</p>
<p>Personally, I say we should give everyone a bare minimum standard of living equivalent to how I am living right now since my parents passed and then have them work for the added extras.</p>
<p>We couldn't do that even 100 years ago. We can do it today.</p>

        <p>Huh, you basically described capitalism with some social policies; you work for monetary reimbursement that you use in exchange for goods and services. Introduction of policies to ensure people don't starve or become homeless is noble but self determination is a very important trait, over reliance on some external entity like a state or charity can only breed apathy, it's why such policies like UBI need careful balancing, lest they become a crutch rather than a safety net.</p>

        <p>These lockdowns are hurting the working class, middle class, women, and minorities the most.</p>
<p>The Taco Bell in my city can no longer afford to stay open past 9pm. I know that sounds like not a big deal, but that means all of the overnight shift was fired. They were mostly minorities in their 20s with families or children. Now they don't have a job. All of this is because the majority of the city is out of work so no one can afford to eat out.</p>
<p>People not having money to spend affects everyone.</p>

        <p>It is more that too many people are 'grooving' that their office jobs are still paying them for working from home (there are some studies that have said "People do better work for those jobs from home!") and don't understand anymore that many people have to go into their workplaces to do their jobs.</p>

        <p>Many people are selfish and self centered even when appearing to care about others all roads lead back to them. As bad as things are many are still comfortable, however they get that comfort. That's when you know it's reached epic levels when they start to whine about the things other than wearing masks. As long as that type of person has comfort, warmth, food, shelter, sameness, etc. and can afford in every way to judge others harshly and even mockingly you will see and hear those comments.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's a variation of ,"Get a job bum." Implying they have one why don't you? Besides not caring it also implies that the person without one is completely at fault and does not have a legitimate reason to be out of work. But lookout if they lose <strong><em>their</em></strong>  job. Then it's everyone's fault <strong><em>but</em></strong>  theirs and they then demand all the help and sympathy that they would deny the bum and everyone else.</p>
