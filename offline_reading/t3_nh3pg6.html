        <p>Yeah I used it after I started using food grade sodium bentonite clay which is actually even better (and should still be in stock on amazon) than activated charcoal but I have some on hand and use both no and then. One of the best things I ever did for myself. I'm both vaccine injured, had a major infection, and severe mold poisoning before and so I had to take a whole host of thing to get back to where I am now but what the clay is going to do for you is act as a gut cleaner. It's comparable to something you'd put in a filter that removes junk and passes right through. How I use it is 2 teaspoons in a cup of purified water and then after I get it all down I follow it with another cup of water.</p>

        <p>I have mysterious ailments that are probably related to a slew of infections, heavy metals, and mold exposure. You're right it's a lot of work to crawl back out of it. NAET and Lebowitz protocol have been helping me. Thanks for the heads-up on bentonite.</p>

        <p>Yeah but at least not everyone knows about the real good stuff. I also use lions mane and tremella fuciformis extract every day to combat the neurological damage I have. Many days now save for some worse one's where I have surges of more autistic like issues and sensory problems I can pass for just about normal. But it takes time, I've been at this for months now. You gotta be persistent with your dosages and go by what your body is telling you to form a routine with it.</p>

        <p>Oddly enough, prenatals, specifically folic acid, are also out of stock in Canada and no set date on when it will be back in. I keep finding it available on some sites but my order gets cancelled a few days later and I get a "we're sorry" coupon. It's great because I am racking up the coupons but not so great because I am running out of options for my vitamins (that aren't fishy smelling horse pills!)</p>

        <p>I agree and I haven't. I'm just pointing out something weird that I happened upon by accident and how the 2 things relate. The "happy vaxxinations" at the end was meant to be sarcastic as obviously it's making people sick enough to be buying all this product up.</p>

        <p>Could be bit pricey for you because of shipping, but on Ebay (more European friendly version of Amazon), I can see it selling clearly (black version, not sure quality but high ratings). I got NAC thru Ebay, that's also being pulled of market quickly (at least in certain countries like USA), it helps I've heard with unbinding spike proteins or something like that (I've bought it in case I get 'jab' second-hand). Do you think this charcoal could seriously help to clear out this vaccine out of people's bodies?</p>

        <p>I have no idea, the only thing I'm trying to imply is the vaccine is CLEARLY making people sick and this is a good natural remedy for stomach issues. So my thought is enough people are feeling sick to their stomach with symptoms and read online that this could ease their symptoms and are buying it all up.</p>

        <p>It's not necessarily related to the vaccine though. There have been lots of supply chain disruptions. Lots of pharmaceuticals are also out or running low. And some companies that also make things like elderberry and vitamin C may have switched over some manufacturing when there was a run on them early in the pandemic.</p>

        <p>It is an interesting data point. And I agree, whether there's meaning there remains to be seen.</p>
<p>But I take several supplements and over the past year have often had to wait for them to come back in stock or buy from places other than those I normally would. It's been an ongoing issue with other supplements so that may be all it is here as well.</p>

        <p>Yes someone here posted that prenatal meds are in short supply as well. So I could be thinking it's one thing - the vax, when really it's another - supply chain disruption. </p>
<p>Something to keep an eye on regardless.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of bizarre things like this I have noticed, we should maybe keep a list. Wood has gone sky high here in the UK, which is bizarre, almost to precious metals status. We aren't short of trees. Is it purely all the amazon boxes? Charcoal is missing from my local health shop too. Miso is impossible to find ( even in Chinese supermarkets). I did see some of that lac the other day and got some just in case.</p>

        <p>Yes I think lumber is also going up in North America as well. Weird for Canada since we have more trees than people.</p>
<p>But charcoal is missing in the UK as well? I would imagine you folks rely on an entirely different supply chain than us. The fact that the same thing is happening to the same product there is very strange indeed.</p>
