    <strong>Anti-govt protest in Paris (Example of crowd control and manipulation)</strong>
    <p><p>At any "leftist" protest in Europe (and beyond) techno, d'n'b music is played (+ unbearably loudly). The protesters think that in this way they are demonstrating their freedom, originality etc. In reality, they are becoming unsuspecting victims of manipulation carried out by special forces which infiltrated their movements. A well-known method of influencing a crowd is through the use of rhythm. Instead of guns and rubber bullets, loudspeakers which transmit loud musical rhythms in all directions are used. Under the influence of these rhythms the crowd turns from aggressive to ecstatic and begins what in the Middle Ages was called the dance of St. Vitus - hysterical dancing and twitching. That is, the point of this music in the video is to put the crowd into a certain state, to disarm it, turning it from a demonstration, ready to stand up for its rights and freedoms, into a herd of ecstatic animals. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOtN-N0o1PY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOtN-N0o1PY</a> Beware of manipulation at protests.</p></p>
