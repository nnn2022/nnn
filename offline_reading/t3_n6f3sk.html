        <p>I am totally on yâ€™all side. I just have a legit question so that we can hammer this point home. I saw a video where someone who smoke a vape pen, put his mask then blows out smoking showing how easily the particles goes through the masks. My question is; what is the size of the Covid particle?</p>

        <p>Hey, I covered this above but the main way covid moves is through droplets of saliva and mucus. It can be airborne but that only really happens when someone isn't wearing a mask. Oxygen comes in, carbon dioxide goes out. Virus is bigger than carbon dioxide and will typically get stuck with a few tiny bits getting out. Should also note that medical masks are different than cloth masks and a cloth mask will not protect you or others as effectively as a proper medical mask will. Of course it can help but definitely not as much.</p>

        <p>Tempted to make this my wallpaper at work... I think I'm 1 of 2 people who won't get the vacc and talk shit on the masks out of like 200.</p>
<p>I'm sure it will be a social day, ironically enough. They tell us to social distance and then they're the ones in your face flapping their gums</p>

        <p>What's up with people claiming they can't breath but also that the virus somehow gets through the mask? The virus is bigger than an oxygen molecule about a thousand times over. It should also be noted that the virus will only become airborne if someone was talking without a barrier, like a mask, to help prevent the virus from becoming airborne. Covid is most commonly spread through droplets of mucus and saliva, which masks help prevent from coming into contact with other peoples mouths. Although masks can muffle speech it does help to prevent some forms of transmission, not all transmission but with so many people around it's definitely an improvement. That being said, the virus when airborne could possibly get through but a lot of it will be stuck in the mask and the immune system will typically do it's job to remove the tiny little bits of it that would get through, unless you are someone who is compromised. Covid is the same as a flu in some ways but is much more infectious and can come with no symptoms, which is dangerous to people who don't have the immunity most of us do. This is why we have these masks. Hope that can clear things up a bit, I'm happy to answer questions.</p>
