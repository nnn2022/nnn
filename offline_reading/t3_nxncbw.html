    <strong>The Science Mafia and the Greatest Crime of our Lifetime</strong>
    <p><p>There is a crime being committed against the world by those we have appointed and trusted to protect us, our health, and the health of our children. Our health regulatory bodies, with the help of the media, the pharmaceutical industry, and some members of the scientific community, have been intentionally putting the health of millions at risk, and are at fault for a significant number of deaths. It is no secret to most that for what many in the pharmaceutical industry lack in morals and scruples, they make up for in raw profit and corruption. It is also no secret that those in positions of power can be bought, compromised, and manipulated. This includes those in government, those who provide us with our information (the media), scientists, and those who control our social media. Following the money is almost always the best way to determine the truth when it comes to corruption and the misdeeds of the powerful. Let us hope that financial motivations are all that there is to explain this, as opposed to a global depopulation agenda, which, while highly unlikely, cannot be ruled out. </p>
<p>The contents of this article will not surprise some of you.. perhaps you've already read it. It will appear fairly obvious to anyone who has been paying attention and thinking for themselves during this pandemic. It will be easy to see if you, like me, refuse to be spoon-fed a heaping mound of bullshit by the media without thinking for yourself. The article that I am sharing with you today is perhaps the most damning thing I have read in quite some time. </p>
<p>Without further ado</p>
<p>https://covid19criticalcare.com/videos-and-press/flccc-releases/flccc-alliance-statement-on-the-irregular-actions-of-public-health-agencies-and-the-widespread-disinformation-campaign-against-ivermectin/</p>
<p>This is not a Facebook meme. </p>
<p>This is not something your aunt who believes in the healing power of rocks told you.</p>
<p>This is not an unsubstantiated claim from a website that has a clear and obvious political agenda.</p>
<p><em>The Plaintiff:</em> </p>
<p>The FLCCC</p>
<p>"The FLCCC Alliance is a nonprofit, humanitarian organization made up of renowned, highly published, world-expert clinician-researchers whose sole mission over the past year has been to develop and disseminate the most effective treatment protocols for COVID-19. In the past six months, much of this effort has been centered on disseminating knowledge of our identification of significant randomized, observational, and epidemiologic studies consistently demonstrating the powerful efficacy of ivermectin in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19."</p>
<p>Credential wise, these guys check out. </p>
<p>https://covid19criticalcare.com/network-support/the-flccc-alliance/</p>
<p>These are not chiropractors or politicians with no background in science or medicine. These are doctors and professors, and many are significantly cited and recognized internationally. </p>
<p>Their goal is admirable and humanitarian. They are advocating for the use of a drug that costs almost nothing. They do not stand to profit from their endeavors in the way that the pharmaceutical industry stands to profit from novel treatments where patents are involved.  The FLCCC are not tied in with billions of dollars of government money. They do not fund and control regulatory agencies. They are a group of doctors concerned with helping patients. </p>
<p><em>The Defendants</em> </p>
<ol>
<li>Big Pharma</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all pharmaceutical companies are corrupt and evil entities that put profit above human life. </p>
<p>Quite a few of them are. </p>
<p>It's naive to think that profit won't be a factor for companies that are accountable to shareholders, and have to ensure that they are able to continue operation.</p>
<p>That being said, there is definitely a line that should not be crossed, and these companies often cross it. This includes companies that are providing vaccines to our citizens. </p>
<p>https://www.asbestos.com/news/2021/02/24/johnsons-billions-talc-settlements/</p>
<p>This company, who knowingly distributed talc that contained asbestos, an action that destroyed lives and gave ovarian cancer to mother, daughters, grandmothers, etc. Think about how you would feel if that was your mother/wife/daughter. 
 https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/</p>
<p>This is one of the companies that has been tasked with developing our vaccines. A company that funds and influences the group that determines our public health policies. Feel free to look into other companies that are trusted to develop our vaccines and other novel covid treatments. There is a long laundry list of corruption and blatant disregard for human life and wellbeing. </p>
<p>That is not to say that the vaccines don't work, or that they are going to kill everyone who took them, or something like that. We just need to establish what type of companies we are dealing with here. </p>
<ol>
<li>The governments of the world, their health policy decision makers, and the WHO</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people in the government care about the lives of their constituents, and are generally good people. </p>
<p>Others care about power, money, and do not care how many lives are ruined in their pursuit of it. </p>
<p>Those in power tend to listen to the advice of public health policymakers like the WHO, FDA, etc. when it comes to making public health policy decisions. </p>
<p>These policy making bodies are funded and partnered with the pharmaceutical industry. </p>
<p>If that seems like a bit of a conflict of interest, that's because it is. </p>
<p>It will be difficult to untangle which members of government, health regulatory agencies, and the WHO are aware that they are being misled, which are turning a blind eye, and which are active participants. That being said, they must be held accountable. </p>
<p><em>The Crime:</em> </p>
<p>From the FLCCC link above</p>
<p>"In February 2021, the British Ivermectin Recommendation Development (BIRD), an international meeting of physicians, researchers, specialists, and patients, followed a guideline development process consistent with the WHO standard. It reached a consensus recommendation that ivermectin, a verifiably safe and widely available oral medicine, be immediately deployed early and globally. The BIRD group’s recommendation rested in part on numerous, well-documented studies reporting that ivermectin use reduces the risk of contracting COVID-19 by over 90% and mortality by 68% to 91%.</p>
<p>A similar conclusion has also been reached by an increasing number of expert groups from the United Kingdom (UK), Italy, Spain, United States (US), and a group from Japan headed by the Nobel Prize-winning discoverer of Ivermectin, Professor Satoshi Omura. Focused rebuttals that are backed by voluminous research and data have been shared with PHAs over the past months. These include the WHO and many individual members of its guideline development group (GDG), the FDA, and the NIH. However, these PHAs continue to ignore or disingenuously manipulate the data to reach unsupportable recommendations against ivermectin treatment. We are forced to publicly expose what we believe can only be described as a “disinformation” campaign astonishingly waged with full cooperation of those authorities whose mission is to maintain the integrity of scientific research and protect public health.</p>
<p>The following accounting and analysis of the WHO ivermectin panel’s highly irregular and inexplicable analysis of the ivermectin evidence supports but one rational explanation: the GDG Panel had a predetermined, nonscientific objective, which is to recommend against ivermectin. This is despite the overwhelming evidence by respected experts calling for its immediate use to stem the pandemic. Additionally, there appears to be a wider effort to employ what are commonly described as “disinformation tactics” in an attempt to counter or suppress any criticism of the irregular activity of the WHO panel."</p>
<p><em>Evidence:</em> </p>
<p>More from the FLCCC article</p>
<p>"The first “red flag” is the conflict between the March 31, 2021, WHO Ivermectin Panel’s “against” recommendation and the NIH’s earlier recommendation from February 12th of a more supportive neutral recommendation based on a lower amount of supportive evidence of ivermectin’s efficacy at that time.
Two flawed lines of analysis by the WHO appear to account for this inconsistent result: </p>
<p>The WHO arbitrarily and severely limited the extent and diversity of study designs considered (e.g., retrospective observational controlled trials (OCT), prospective OCTs, epidemiological, quasi-randomized, randomized, placebo-controlled, etc.). </p>
<p>The WHO mischaracterized the overall quality of the trial data to undermine the included studies.</p>
<p>The Severely Limited Extent and Diversity of Ivermectin Data Considered by the WHO’s Ivermectin Panel 
The WHO Ivermectin Panel arbitrarily included only a narrow selection of the available medical studies that their research team had been instructed to collect when formulating their recommendation, with virtually no explanation why they excluded such a voluminous amount of supportive medical evidence. This was made obvious at the outset due to the following: </p>
<p>No pre-established protocol for data exclusion was published, which is a clear departure from standard practice in guideline development. </p>
<p>The exclusions departed from the WHO’s own original search protocol it required of Unitaid’s ivermectin research, which collected a much wider array of randomized controlled trials (RCT).</p>
<p>Key Ivermectin Trial Data Excluded from Analysis </p>
<p>The WHO excluded all “quasi-randomized” RCTs from consideration (two excluded trials with over 200 patients that reported reductions in mortality). </p>
<p>The WHO excluded all RCTs where ivermectin was compared to or given with other medications. Two such trials with over 750 patients reported reductions in mortality.</p>
<p>The WHO excluded from consideration 7 of the 23 available ivermectin RCT results.  Such irregularities skewed the proper assessment of important outcomes in at least the following ways: </p>
<p>Mortality Assessment </p>
<p>WHO Review: Excluded multiple RCTs such that only 31 total trials deaths occurred; despite this artificially meager sample, an estimate of up to a 91% reduction in the risk of death was found.[1]</p>
<p>Compared to the BIRD Review: Included 13 RCTs with 107 deaths observed and found a 2.5% mortality with ivermectin vs. 8.9% in controls; estimated reduction in risk of death=68%; highly statistically significant, (p=.007).</p>
<p>Assessment of Impacts on Viral Clearance</p>
<p>WHO Review: 6 RCTs, 625 patients. The Panel avoided mention of the important finding of a strong dose-response in regard to this outcome. </p>
<p>This action in (i) is indefensible given that their Unitaid research team found that among 13 RCTs, 10 of the 13 reported statistically significant reductions in time to viral clearance, with larger reductions with multiday dosing than single-day, consistent with a profound dose-response relationship.[2]</p>
<p>Adverse Effects</p>
<p>WHO: Only included 3 RCTs studying this outcome. Although no statistical significance was found, the slight imbalance in this limited sample allowed the panel to repeatedly document concerns for “harm” with ivermectin treatment.</p>
<p>Compare (a) to the WHO’s prior safety analysis in their 2018 Application for Inclusion of Ivermectin onto Essential Medicines List for Indication of Scabies: </p>
<p>“Over one billion doses have been given in large-scale prevention programs.”</p>
<p>“Adverse events associated with ivermectin treatment. are primarily minor and transient.”[3]</p>
<p>The WHO excluded all RCTs studying the prevention of COVID-19 with ivermectin, without supporting rationale. Three RCTs including almost 800 patients found an over 90% reduction in the risk of infection when ivermectin is taken preventively.[4]</p>
<p>The WHO excluded observational controlled trials (OCT), with 14 studies of ivermectin. These included thousands of patients, including those employing propensity matching, a technique shown to lead to similar accuracy as RCTs. </p>
<p>One large, propensity-matched OCT from the US found that ivermectin treatment was associated with a large decrease in mortality.</p>
<p>A summary analysis of the combined data from the 14 available ivermectin OCTs found a large and statistically significant decrease in mortality.</p>
<p>The WHO excluded numerous published and posted epidemiologic studies, despite requesting and receiving a presentation of the results from one leading epidemiologic research team. These studies found:</p>
<p>In numerous cities and regions with population-wide ivermectin distribution campaigns, large decreases in both excess deaths and COVID-19 case fatality rates were measured immediately following the campaigns.</p>
<p>Countries with pre-existing ivermectin prophylaxis campaigns against parasites demonstrate significantly lower COVID-19 case counts and deaths compared to neighboring countries without such campaigns.</p>
<p>Assessment of the Quality of the Evidence Base by WHO Guideline Group 
The numerous above actions minimizing the extent of the evidence base were then compounded by the below efforts to minimize the quality of the evidence base:
The WHO mischaracterized the overall quality of the included trials as “low” to “very low,” conflicting with numerous independent expert research group findings:</p>
<p>An international expert guideline group independently reviewed the BIRD proceeding and instead found the overall quality of trials to be “moderate.” </p>
<p>The WHO’s own Unitaid systematic review team currently grade the overall quality as “moderate.”</p>
<p>The WHO graded the largest trial it included to support a negative assessment of ivermectin’s mortality impacts as “low risk of bias.” A large number of expert reviewers have graded that same trial as “high risk of bias,” detailed in an open letter  signed by over 100 independent physicians.</p>
<p>We must emphasize this critical fact: If the WHO had more accurately assessed the quality of evidence as “moderate certainty,” consistent with the multiple independent research teams above, ivermectin would instead become the standard of care worldwide, similar to what occurred after the dexamethasone evidence finding decreased mortality was graded as moderate quality, which then led to its immediate global adoption in the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 in July of 2020.[5]
Further, The WHO’s own guideline protocol stipulates that quality assessments should be upgraded when there is the following:</p>
<p>a large magnitude of effect (despite their data estimating a survival benefit of 81%, the low number of studies and events included allowed them to dismiss this finding as “very low certainty”) or;</p>
<p>evidence of a dose-response relationship. The WHO shockingly omits the well-publicized reports by their Unitaid research team of a powerful dose-response relationship with viral clearance. </p>
<p>In sum, the WHO’s recommendation that “ivermectin not be used outside clinical trials” is based entirely upon:</p>
<p>the dismissal of large amounts of trial data; </p>
<p>the inaccurate downgrading of evidence quality; and</p>
<p>the deliberate omission of a dose-response relationship with viral clearance.</p>
<p>Consequently, these actions formed the basis of their ability to avoid a recommendation for immediate global use.
Even more surprising is that based on their “very low certainty” finding, the panel goes on to “infer” that “most patients would be reluctant to use a medication for which the evidence left high uncertainty regarding effects on outcomes they consider important.” 
This statement is insupportable in light of the above actions. No patient could ever rationally consent to a trial in which they were acutely ill and would be subject to the possibility of receiving a placebo, once informed of: the large amount of relevant and positive trials that the WHO removed from consideration, their avoidance of reporting a large dose-response relationship, and their widely contradicted  “very low certainty” grading of large mortality benefits. Such a trial would result in a historic ethical research violation, causing both a widespread loss of life and a resultant loss of trust in PHAs and research institutions for decades to come.
The many methods employed by the WHO to distort the evidence base and arrive at a non-recommendation are made even more suspicious and questionable by the following: </p>
<p>The WHO GDG did not hold a vote on the use of ivermectin. This highly irregular decision was purportedly based on the Ivermectin Panel’s “consensus on evidence certainty.”</p>
<p>Unitaid Sponsors allegedly inserted multiple limitations and weakened the conclusions in the preprint, systematic review manuscript by the Unitaid research team, which has recently led to formal charges of scientific misconduct.</p>
<p>Recent WHO whistleblower complaints of external influences in other WHO Covid reports, as well as attempts by massive external funding organizations to increase their influence in formulating WHO policies.  </p>
<p>The finding of marked differences in the evidence bases used to support prior WHO/BIRD guideline recommendations for ivermectin in other diseases: </p>
<p>WHO: Approved ivermectin in the treatment of scabies based on 10 RCTs that included only 852 patients, despite it being inferior to the standard of care.</p>
<p>FDA: Approved ivermectin in the treatment of strongyloidiasis based on 5 RCTs that included only 591 patients.</p>
<p>BIRD: Approved ivermectin in March, 2021, for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 based on 21 RCTs and 2,741 patients.</p>
<p>*Further Considerations:"</p>
<p>Also from the FLCCC article </p>
<p>As expert clinician-researchers in society, we are firmly committed to ensuring that public health policy decisions derive from scientific data.  Disturbingly, after extensive analysis of the recent WHO ivermectin guideline recommendation, we could not arrive at a credible scientific rationale to explain the numerous irregular, arbitrary, and inconsistent behaviors documented above. Further, after consultation with numerous physicians, guideline reviewers, legal experts, and veteran PHA scientists, we identified two major socio-political-economic forces that serve as the main barrier influences preventing ivermectin’s incorporation into public health policy in major parts of the world. They are: 
1)  the modern structure and function of what we will describe as “Big Science” and;
2)  the presence of an active “Political-Economic Disinformation Campaign.”
“Big Science”
Also known as “Big RCT Fundamentalism,” Big Science reflects a dramatic shift in the practice of modern evidence-based medicine (EBM). Beginning before COVID, it has since rapidly evolved into the current system that more tightly meshes the entities of “Big Pharma,” “Big PHA’s/Academic Health Centers” (AMC), “Big Journals,” “Big Media,” and “Big Social Media” into the public health system’s efforts at guiding patient care, research and policy.
The structure and function of “Big Science” in COVID-19 is most simply represented as follows:</p>
<p>Only arbitrarily defined, “large, well-designed” RCTs (Big RCT), generally conducted on North American or European shores, can “prove” the efficacy of a medicine.</p>
<p>Only Big Pharma/Big PHA/AMCs have the resources/infrastructure to conduct Big-RCTs. (Many equate Big PHA/AMC with Big Pharma, given the funding source of the former.)</p>
<p>Only Big RCTs by Big Pharma or Big PHA/AMC can publish study findings in high-impact, high-income country medical journals (Big Journals). </p>
<p>Only medicines supported by Big Journal publications are deemed to have “sufficient evidence” and “proven efficacy” to then be recommended by Big PHAs.</p>
<p>Only medicines recommended by Big PHAs are covered by “Big Media” or escape censorship on “Big Social Media.”</p>
<p>Conversely, repurposed, off-patient medications such as ivermectin do not attract Big PHA or Big Pharma sponsors to conduct the mandatory Big RCT. Given this structural handicap, many effective medicines including ivermectin are consequently incapable of ever meeting Big PHA standards for approval in such a system. In the case of ivermectin, it is then considered, first by Big PHAs, then throughout Big Media and Big Social media, to be “unproven” given it lacks “sufficient evidence” and is thus heavily censored from public discussion and awareness. Mentions of ivermectin on Big Social Media led to the removal of a popular Facebook group (“Ivermectin MD Team” with over 10,000 followers). Additionally, all YouTube videos mentioning ivermectin in treatment of Covid-19 were removed or demonetized, as well as Twitter pages locked. Further, in Big Media, even the most credentialed independent and expert groups who recommend ivermectin based on a large body of irrefutable evidence are labeled as “controversial” and purveyors of “medical misinformation.”
A health system structured to function in this manner is clearly vulnerable to and overly influenced by entities with financial interests. Further, in Covid, such systems have evolved into rigidly operating via top-down edicts and widespread censoring. This allows little ability for emerging scientific developments not funded by Big Pharma to be disseminated from within the system or through media or social media until years later when, and if, a Big RCT is completed. This barrier has presented as an enduring horror throughout the pandemic given the widespread loss of life caused by the systematic withholding of numerous rapidly identified, safe and effective, repurposed medicines for fear of using “unproven therapies” without “sufficient evidence” for use. Alternatively, and for the first time in many physicians’ careers, those who seek to treat their patients with such therapies, based on their professional interpretation of the existing evidence are restricted by their employers issuing edicts “from above.” They are then forced to follow protocols that rely predominantly on pharmaceutically engineered therapeutics.
It must be recognized that distinct from “regulatory” agencies such as the FDA, whose system often relies upon the primary importance of a “Big RCT,” stronger foundations used by PHAs are available. One of the long-standing tenets of modern evidence-based medicine is that the highest form of medical evidence is a “systematic review and meta-analysis” of RCTs and not a sole Big RCT. Disturbingly, not one of the Big PHAs mention this established principle or their long-standing reliance on such evidence-based practices for issuing recommendations. In the case of ivermectin, they willfully ignore the multiple published expert meta-analyses of ivermectin RCTs, including almost two dozen trials and thousands of patients, reporting consistent reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral clearance.
These improvements are found consistently and repeatedly, no matter the RCT design, size, or quality, and from varied centers and countries throughout the world. All studies were done without any identified conflict of interest with the vast majority of double-blind, single-blind, quasi-randomized, open-label, standard of care comparison, combination therapy comparisons, etc., reporting benefits. Satoshi Omura, Nobel Prize-winning discoverer of ivermectin, wrote in his team’s recent review paper that “the probability of this judgement on ivermectin’s superior clinical performance being false is estimated to be 1 in 4 trillion.” This supports our public warnings against further “placebo-controlled trials” given the near absolute certainty of harm to research subjects included in a placebo Big RCT.
Conversely, despite sitting atop the highest form of medical evidence, many non-regulatory Big PHAs around the world cry out for a Big RCT. This is while avoiding the issuance of even one of the several “weaker” recommendation options available to them in the setting of a low-cost, widely available medicine with an unparalleled safety profile and a constantly surging humanitarian crisis, even in the interim. Insufficient evidence, unproven — these are comments from WHO, NIH, Europe’s EMA, South Africa’s SAPHRA, France’s ANSM, United Kingdom’s MHRA, and Australia’s TGA.
Most disturbing to contemplate is our estimation that if the use of penicillin in bacterial infection were to have been tested in these same numbers and types of trials in the 1940s, the graphical display of benefits would look nearly identical to those found with ivermectin. Further, the U.S Cures Act of 2016, “specifically designed to accelerate and bring new innovations and advances faster and more efficiently to the patients who need them” emphasized the importance of using various forms of “real-world evidence” data to aid in regulatory decision-making. We can find no evidence of an organized effort to examine the more than 14, often large OCTs that show evidence of the substantial beneficial use of ivermectin. Further, no PHA has cited the numerous convincing epidemiological analyses that find rapidly falling case fatality rates following ivermectin distribution campaigns.
With the lack of a credible explanation for the absence of even a weak recommendation for ivermectin in the setting of widespread increased death rates from COVID-19, numerous citizens have speculated that this can only be explained by the presence of an active disinformation campaign by entities with nonscientific and largely financial objectives dependant on the non-recognition of ivermectin’s efficacy. We explore the near certainty of this occurring below.
Active Political-Economic “Disinformation” Campaign
“Disinformation” campaigns, best described in the article, “The Disinformation Playbook,” are initiated when independent science interferes with or opposes the interests of corporations or policymakers. Although thankfully rare, in certain cases these entities will actively seek to manipulate science and distort the truth about scientific findings that imperil their profit or policy objectives. First developed by the tobacco industry decades ago, these deceptive tactics include the following; </p>
<p>The Fake: Conduct counterfeit science and try to pass it off as legitimate research.</p>
<p>The Blitz: Harass scientists speaking out with results inconvenient for industry.</p>
<p>The Diversion: Manufacture uncertainty about science where little or none exists. </p>
<p>The Screen: Buy credibility through alliances with academia/professional societies.  </p>
<p>The Fix: Manipulate government processes to influence policy inappropriately.</p>
<p>Numerous examples of the above disinformation tactics by corporations and policymakers, particularly within the pharmaceutical industry, have been documented: </p>
<p>Georgia Pacific publishing “fake science” on the dangers of asbestos (The Fake)</p>
<p>Merck manipulating the science around the drug Vioxx (The Fake)</p>
<p>The NFL intimidating and discrediting scientists reporting link between football and Traumatic Brain Injury (The Blitz)</p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline silencing scientists exposing the dangers of Avandia (The Blitz)</p>
<p>American Chemistry Council sows uncertainty about formaldehyde risks (The Diversion)</p>
<p>Purdue Pharma partners with academic centers to hide dangers of opioids (The Screen)</p>
<p>Pfizer pressures FDA to downplay risk of animal drug causing high arsenic (The Fix)</p>
<p>Most worrisome is that ivermectin appears to be up against one of the largest financial and global policy oppositions in modern history, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>Numerous Big Pharma companies and sovereign nations selling billions of vaccine doses. </p>
<p>Scale of market for vaccines now exponentially increasing due to the developing market for “booster shots” against rapidly appearing variants. </p>
<p>Big Pharma now promising investors to employ price hikes on vaccines as COVID-19 passes from a “pandemic” to an “endemic.”</p>
<p>Concerns of numerous Big Pharma and Big PHA’s that if ivermectin is approved as effective treatment for COVID-19, EUAs for all vaccines would be revoked.</p>
<p>Disinformation: FDA posted notices overstating the dangers of ivermectin and against use of ivermectin; despite not having reviewed the trials data.</p>
<p>Disinformation: WHO Panel dismisses/ignores most of available evidence base.</p>
<p>Disinformation: WHO Panel avoids bringing ivermectin evidence to a vote.</p>
<p>Disinformation: Unitaid sponsor influences writing of manuscript conclusions.</p>
<p>Disinformation: EMA erroneously claims effective concentrations are unattainable.</p>
<p>Numerous Big Pharma/Big PHA concerns that ivermectin’s potential as an alternative to vaccines may increase vaccine hesitancy and disrupt mass vaccination rollouts. </p>
<p>Opponents include large philanthropic sponsors with global vaccination goals.</p>
<p>Disinformation: WHO Panel does not review ivermectin prevention trials.</p>
<p>Numerous Big Pharma company investments in novel, engineered therapies (i.e., oral antivirals by Merck and Pfizer and Gilead) directly compete with ivermectin.</p>
<p>Disinformation: Merck places a post on their website, without scientific supporting evidence or named scientist authors that: “No evidence of either a mechanism of action, clinical efficacy or safety in COVID-19 exists.”</p>
<p>Disinformation: A Merck managing director argues against use in the Philippines by stating: “The levels of evidence do not come up to standards.”  </p>
<p>Big Pharma company’s (Astra-Zeneca) investment into a long-acting antibody product for prevention and treatment of COVID-19, which competes with ivermectin.</p>
<p>Numerous Big Pharma’s monoclonal antibody products that compete with ivermectin.</p>
<p>Big Pharma’s Remdesivir demand would rapidly decline once hospitalizations were to decrease after ivermectin approval.</p>
<p>Based on the lack of a rational explanation for the above actions by WHO, Merck, FDA, and Unitaid, we conclude that they result from an active disinformation campaign, executed both through the PHA’s, media and the WHO Guideline group recommendations. As highly published researchers, we find the allegations of scientific misconduct in the writing of the WHO/United research team’s meta-analysis manuscript to be deeply disturbing. It clearly represents a disinformation tactic with an intent to distort and diminish the reporting of a large magnitude benefit on mortality among many hundreds of patients. Further, Merck’s demonstrably and blatantly false statements against ivermectin deserve  no further discussion. It is yet another entry into the disturbing historical record of actions committed by a Big Pharma entity with the primary intent of protecting profit at the expense of the welfare of global citizens</p>
<p><em>The Verdict:</em> </p>
<p>The article is extremely compelling. They have a strong amount of evidence, and list it out thoughtfully. </p>
<p>Things are looking quite bad for the media, governments of the world, WHO, and big pharma</p>
<p>The Motive section of the article is particularly damning. </p>
<p>There are hundreds billions of dollars at play here, so ask yourself, who stands to profit? Who stands to lose face? Who already put up the money for something and wants to make sure they get the value they paid for? Which of the parties is a team of doctors on a humanitarian mission with no clear financial motivation? </p>
<p>If ivermectin is as effective as studies indicate (see link below) then it stands to reason that it could end vaccine EUA, as the article mentions. </p>
<p>https://ivmmeta.com/</p>
<p>This would be a huge loss to the pharmaceutical companies, governments who prepaid for vaccines and funded them, for the investors of the pharmaceutical companies, and for the public health policymakers that are funded by the other groups listed here. </p>
<p>There is clear motive here. </p>
<p>Moderna had a share price of around $19 before the pandemic. Now it is at $216. </p>
<p>Johnson and johnson was around $146, now it's at $164</p>
<p>Phizer went from around $34 to $40 </p>
<p>Here's the story of the development of ivermectin</p>
<p>https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/10/story-behind-drug-just-won-nobel-prize-medecine-mectizan-ivermectin-william-campbell-satoshi-omura/</p>
<p>"In the late 1970s, Satoshi Omura, a scientist at the Kitasato Institute in Tokyo found a component of a soil-dwelling bacteria (that’s right, he literally found it in the dirt) called Streptomyces that was very effective at killing parasites. He then sent cultures of this bacteria to William Campbell in New Jersey who worked for Merck &amp; Co., the fourth largest pharmaceutical company in the world. There, Campbell successfully developed a drug called ivermectin from a compound in the bacteria culture. The discovery was a huge pharmaceutical breakthrough and the drug was determined to be extremely safe for humans and easily distributed.
But, as with many infectious disease drugs, the vast majority of people who needed it lived in the developing world and could not afford it.</p>
<p>What happened next was unprecedented.</p>
<p>In 1987, Merck announced it would partner with the WHO and donate Mectizan, the drug’s brand name, to any country who requested it for as long as they needed it. Before this, no large pharmaceutical company had ever given away a drug they developed to eradicate a disease. At a news conference after Merck’s announcement, the late Massachusetts senator Ted Kennedy said, “Merck’s gift to the World Health Organization is more than a medical breakthrough–it is truly a triumph of the human spirit.”</p>
<p>Since 1987, the Mectizan Donation Program has given out more than a billion treatments for onchoceriasis and lymphatic filariasis to people in 33 countries (in the late ’90s GlaxoSmithKline contributed another drug for lymphatic filariasis to the program). As a result, the transmission of onchoceriasis has been stopped in many countries. Last year Ecuador became the second affected country, after Colombia, to entirely eradicate the disease. Lymphatic filariasis cases have dramatically decreased, as well. The WHO forecasts that both diseases could be eliminated by 2020.</p>
<p>Omura and Campbell were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their work.</p>
<p>The Nobel committee said ivermectin’s importance was “immeasurable” for the health of many in the world’s poorest regions."</p>
<p>So basically, nobody stands to profit from this drug like they do from remdesivir and the vaccines, along with any other new novel therapies that are developed. </p>
<p>The evidence is mounting that our governments, in conjunction with the WHO, Big pharma, the media, and other regulatory agencies, have intentionally misled the population, manipulated science, and prevented the use of a drug that could have saved lives. </p>
<p>As evidence continues to mount, a call to hold these groups accountable must follow. </p>
<p>They are putting money above human lives and it needs to stop.</p></p>
