        <p>Public opinion is only trending one way, and the pace is accelerating the more politicians and business leaders try to prevent it. This is why I am 100% certain our testimony will prevail. Think of the Iraq War opponents: they were vilified at the time but now everyone claims to have been one.</p>

        <p>At this point I‚Äôll take it.</p>
<p>I see why people get annoyed with former doomers changing sides, because it is very frustrating in some ways, especially when so much of it appears to have been political.</p>
<p>However, I for one am more than happy to forgive them and welcome them to our side with open arms. Brainwashing is a powerful thing, and at one point (in the very beginning) I was kind of a doomer too, although not in the ‚Äúshaming‚Äù sense (I‚Äôve always loathed cancel culture and everything associated with it) and not for very long. But I was definitely scared of the virus around March and April and barely went anywhere for about a month.</p>
<p>Strength in numbers. Winning the war against the new normal is far more important than rubbing people‚Äôs faces in the fact that we were right... although I must admit, it feels pretty damn good to say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù, even if it‚Äôs just in my head. üòÅ</p>

        <p>Exactly! I forgive them, no questions asked, because if suspicions or vitriol linger then their past self lives on in defensiveness. If forgiveness is offered, it's gone for good. Most of them only wanted to find group acceptance anyway: we should give it to them and get on with the real work.</p>
