    <strong>I always thought the people wearing their masks the 12 feet to their table at a restaurant, and then removing them, were doing it because they had to.</strong>
    <p><p>However, since at this moment in time it is not required to wear a mask indoors anymore, but people are seeing a ‚Äúsurge‚Äù on the news, I have seen a few groups of people donning their cloth sparkly masks to go to their tables, or to a BAR SEAT at a packed bar with standing room only, or getting up to go to the bathroom. You are in a restaurant, everyone is eating and laughing and carrying on and living life. In what world does your Lily Pulitzer mask do anything for anyone? If it makes you feel good, fine. But let‚Äôs not pretend your masked 30 second walk to and from the bathroom changed the lives of anyone around you, and don‚Äôt make me do it.</p></p>

        <p>this is what I‚Äôve been saying all along.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve seen it first hand at my work; no masks at beginning of pandemic. We were staggered shifts and distanced so corporate told us ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. Then it flips to mask up over the nose and management, defeating the purpose of staggered/distanced shifts, walking around everyone to make sure their mask was on ‚Äúproperly‚Äù.</p>
<p>And I said precisely the same thing, if you are so concerned, wtf are you doing coming into my, and everyone else‚Äôs, personal space?</p>
<p>It‚Äôs so refreshing to know I‚Äôm not alone! Most of my co workers are ready to retire boomers. One guy, god bless him, is so far gone (his kids/family sound like a disaster and he only repeats Bill Maher, Oliver, Noah)‚Ä¶ truly couldn‚Äôt register it when I pointed it out to him‚Ä¶</p>
<p>He also believed ‚ÄúBill Gates actually really knows what he‚Äôs talkin about if you listen to him.‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>

        <p>They have been successfully conditioned to comply. They can no longer think for themselves. Going to Target in my city is a pain in the ass when it‚Äôs busy because back when there were occupancy limits, they put 2 employees and a pulpit in front of the registers and everyone had to line up and when they got to the pulpit, the employees told them which register to line up at. Anyway they stopped all that nonsense a few months ago but to this day the sheeple STILL stand around at the front of the registers waiting to be told where to go.</p>

        <p>I was in line the other day. 2 older women also waiting in line starting talking about masks. One was masked, the other unmasked. Unmasked asks if masks were mandatory again. The masked woman said no but she just likes to wear hers. The unmasked lady said that's okay, I just didn't want to be breaking the rules, but I've been vaccinated!!!1!! She finishes with "I hear there's a new surge and I think its those unvaccinated ruining it for everyone"</p>

        <p>Had a real giggle moment at a restaurant when our very large party stood in the doorway with masks on (mandatory at the time, and small business so we complied) yet we literally were a couple of feet from the tables where no one was masked.  How ridiculous that people actually believe you can spread it while standing, but not by sitting. When does everyone wake up to the government shenanigans?</p>
