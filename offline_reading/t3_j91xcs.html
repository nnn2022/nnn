        <p>Read other comment on this post. I have proven anti maskers wrong over and over again and the mentality of anti maskers is pitiful. </p>
<p>There's being misguided (for which I'd love to help you out with showing you the truth) and then there is being blatently ignorant and loving every second of it. Anti maskers are typically the latter. I've heard the points anti maskers make. I've damn near heard them all and they're all either straight up false or misguiding. </p>
<p>You wanna talk? Let's talk. Defend not wearing a mask and I'll defend my claim as to why you should.</p>
<p>Edit:
I'm offering to talk. All who downvote, make your case and defend it. Don't stand in the backdrop, rise to the top and prove yourself right.</p>

        <p>Your other comment was just complaining and speaking about your own personal anecdote. I don't see how you can prove someone's opinion wrong with your own opinion, and I especially don't see how your one comment has proven anti-maskers, as a whole, wrong "over and over again".</p>
<p>Lol you want to seriously talk and have me defend my side, just so you can "help me out with showing me the truth"? Doesn't sound like a very productive conversation, especially since you've already came in here being blatantly incendiary and thinking you're above all here. If you wanted a conversation, perhaps come in acting like less of a jackass and you'd have found people here who are quite civil and willing to have a conversation with you.</p>
<p>All our points are false or misguiding? You mean like how people act like this thing is cancer floating around the air, fear-mongering at every opportunity? I don't think the crushed economy and numerous mental health issues are false or misguiding.</p>

        <p>Hmmm well considering there is scientific data, studies, and professionals at play, there is no opinion. There is only the harsh truth. Anti maskers are wrong when they say masks don't work. Facts don't care for your feelings. </p>
<p>The freedoms part is opinion and subjective so I'll give you that although in practice, there is a lot more fact supporting that there are no freedoms being taken away by you wearing a mask.  </p>
<p>Anti masker points were referring to people who just refuse to wear masks. I'm not talking about yhe media's fear mongering (they are shit awful with that) nor am I talking about the economy when it comes to people just refusing to wear masks.</p>

        <p>&rt;there is no opinion. There is only the harsh truth.</p>
<p>Why we can't have a productive conversation. It's just like discussing politics with someone on the other side. One person says their part, the other person disagrees and says their part. The first person presents their stats and evidence, the second person does the same - while both parties say "Nyeh! My stats are good and yours are dumb!"</p>
<p>I never even brought up freedoms.</p>
<p>Since you are the all-knowing, would you care to explain to me why people who are terrified of this (weak as fuck) virus can't just "Stay. The fuck. Home."? It's easier than ever before to stay home and be lazy.</p>

        <p>Show me some proof that masks don't work. Can't use Tunevall study, it says masks may be used for airborne infections in the study itself. </p>
<p>Politics are subjective and opinion based. Abortion, current domestic affairs, foreign affairs, etc. Most opinions. </p>
<p>Just to make sure, let's focus on one topic at a time then because I'd love to debate.</p>
<p>Masks, do they work? And are they worth it. </p>
<p>My answer, yes and yes. Your answer? If we disagree let's debate. </p>
<p>Well, considering that anti masker's main argument is that it is an infringement of their freedoms, I thought it went hand in hand with the topic. But let's discuss one topic at a time from now on. </p>
<p>Never said I was all knowing, but I sure know that anti maskers are in the wrong here when speaking about refusing to wear masks. The economic side (which you brought up even though it doesn't play into anti maskers) is a different story. Different places were affected differently. My state is more spread out and not as affected so a long lockdown is not necessary. A short one to get the rapidly growing cases down and under control was necessary. There may be even more necessity for a lockdown since people are throwing parties and getting schools and businesses shut down. But staying in lockdown until the vaccine is here won't solve our problems and will in fact create more. The virus is not weak as fuck. When left without medical care the death rate has jumped to nearly 10%. As of now, the death rate is around 2-4% on average across the world. The flu is far below 1%. 10% is nothing to call weak. Its biggest danger is the infection rate. It is very infectious which lets it spread fast (extremely fast in high population density areas) and can overwhelm hospitals like in Italy. You are talking about a lockdown tbhough even though I addressed refusal to wear masks.</p>
<p>So, let's focus on this one topic that I brought up in the first place and then we can discuss the next as we go. </p>
<p>So, masks. Do they work? And are they worth it? This is what I address when I say anti maskers. </p>
<p>I'd like to hear your take on that.</p>

        <p>&rt;Show me some proof that masks don't work.</p>
<p>This leads to playing politics, like I mentioned in the previous reply. I give my evidence, you give yours, we both remain unmoved. Even if there's 100% proof that masks work well and everyone in the world accepts this, this wouldn't change the notion that people should just "Stay. The fuck. Home." if they're so deathly afraid.</p>
<p>&rt;let's debate.</p>
<p>Just a heads up, I'm not planning on debating much further in the middle of the night when my sportsball's on in 7 hours. And like I said anyway, I see absolutely zero point in debating, because no one's mind will be changed in the slightest and it just turns into the "Well your evidence sucks, I believe my stats!" game. I'll banter back and forth for a little while like I'm doing now, but this is Reddit and I really don't give a shit, and I'll forget all this in 12 hours. Solely even went this far because I wasn't feeling tired.</p>
<p>&rt;Never said I was all knowing</p>
<p>When you say that I'm, at best, misguided - and that you'll show me the truth - that heavily comes off as being all-knowing.</p>
<p>&rt;The virus is not weak as fuck.</p>
<p>It certainly is. This is just another disagreement where it'll be "My stats good, your stats bad!"</p>
<p>&rt;When left without medical care</p>
<p>That's kind of a huge factor. I'd assume that every virus, disease, etc. gets worse over time if left untreated, and will lead to a higher death count.</p>
<p>&rt;It is very infectious which lets it spread fast </p>
<p>Someone can feel free to "Stay. The fuck. Home." if they're so dealthy afraid.</p>
<p>&rt;So, masks. Do they work? And are they worth it? </p>
<p>Again, stats and evidence on both sides, but I don't see anything conclusively showing they work as effectively as intended and desired - espcially seeing as most people seem to wear them improperly. Not sure what you mean by "worth it".</p>
<p>My point still remains. If someone is deathly afraid of this virus, they can stay home and be lazy. Wear your mask, use delivery services, incessantly wash your hands and use hand sanitizer, wear gloves, socially distance, limit contact with others, do whatever you have to do. But don't go out and expect everyone to be as paranoid about this virus as you are.</p>

        <p>Oh jeez. So you mean to tell me that people can't come to a concensus based on data? Prove my shit wrong and I prove yours wrong. Open mind is the key. I'm still open minded but I am pushy as every attempt at swaying me with proper evidence has failed. Not due to closed mindedness but due to false data (proven to be false by many), misleading data, and misinterpreted data (Tunevall study is a great example of this) so far nothing has moved me. I don't play opinion when numbers and facts are at play. It doesn't work like that. Make a proper argument with facts, studies, claims, and conclusions and we can talk.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When I say show you the truth, it just means I am clearing up misconceptions such as "the masks protect you, wear them!" They do offer some protection but since the virus can also be transmitted to you via touching your face and the capillaries in your eye lids, masks don't really protect you. They do offer some protection but not enough to be relied on as such. Masks are there to protect others. If the mask if effective (aka get the right ones) you will filter out the particles you breathe out that carry the virus, therefore preventing the virus from getting out in the first place. This, however isn't perfect and that is why social distancing is still a big factor.</p>
<p>It's not about being deathly afraid and staying home, that's how you create the forced unemployment you were all about earlier. It's about putting on a fucking mask like a grown ass man and going about your day without bitching. It's that simple and it is utterly disappointing to see people do otherwise. People do this globally but America has become the epicenter of shrugging off science and facts for beliefs.</p>
<p>Of course every disease and virus gets worse without treatment but the reality is that Italy had this happen due to the high infection rate Covid has. Again, fact, not opinion. It is widely known that Covid is highly infectious and that is the reason it is dangerous. A 3% death rate with a shitty infection rate is nothing. It can't go anywhere and so it is so much more manageable.</p>
<p>HOLY FUCK MAN. Do I need to spell it out? Facts have no sides. They are facts and don't give a single handed fuck on your opinion. The way they may be presented can be misleading and lead to bias but when you pull it straight from the professional source, there is no bias, just the fucking facts.</p>
<p>It's also not about paranoia kiddo. It's about the economy, lives. as well as the future. I would love to see the world if everyone treated it like you ignorant fucks. It would be disaster. That is opinion because hey, when you lost your job since you hit the worst depression in history due to everyone at work becoming sick around the whole country causing food, fuel, and electricity to go out, you can call it a great country after all. I know I'd beg to differ but okay.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: That's the thing about you anti masker and the reason I gave you all the fuck you. You had many times to prove me wrong but instead you put it on opinion when facts are presented to you. It is so damn American I swear. Ignorance has plagued this country to a depth I have never thought possible. I gave you my facts ("opinion" in your words) multiple times and you chose to never prove shit wrong about them. Find flaws in the study and prove the data irrelevant or false. So far, no one has. Truth is a concept that was tried to be proven wrong many many times but never once succeeded in being proven wrong. Therefore, since no studies have shown that there is a direct correlation to masks not working  for airborne infections, it is the truth until someone can prove it wrong. </p>
<p>While I know you will find it not worth your time to have a proper discussion, I suggest you send me a proper study that has proven time and time again that masks do not work for airborne infections. I bet my left ass cheek you'll come up dry.</p>

        <p>The social opportunities are great. I've made new friends, sat with a disabled girl to include her and stop people from harrasing her, and I'm doing great. Never been healthier when it comes to my lifestyle and I mean it.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh and not to mention, the changes in routine really helped me get organized and improve time management before I head off to college. Compared to last year, my time management is impeccable.</p>

        <p>Well, had most of America not felt so entitled to their "freedoms" (they're illusions at this point and to put it bluntly, a mask isn't taking away your freedom. If you don't like it, get out. Oh wait now that you are being told to do so, you don't like it but when my mom was told so, she was supposed to just listen and take it. Our founding fathers would have died for this country and all this country asks of you now is to just fucking wear a mask. But no. It's too much huh? ) and just done what they needed to, maybe we wouldn't have had so much of an unemployment rate. </p>
<p>Our "leader" failed to be adaptable and face the facts and as the world kept its shit together we decided otherwise and it shows. </p>
<p>We are now in a recession, unemployment is high, and what do we have to show? Nothing. No freedoms were harmed nor saved. We still have one of the highest case <em>rates</em> in the world and schools who are just going fuck all, are already closing down. </p>
<p>My school was doing fine with what we call level 2. It was a good balance of in person and online class until people like the ones in this sub chimed in their 2 cents and forced the school to move into level 1 where everyone goes back to school at once. No precautions wete possible anymore.  A week later the cases exploded, teachers are missing, I am quarantined as I am displaying symptoms (I have a very high risk mother, thank you very much), the volleyball and football team all are ill, and things are rolling downhill faster than ever. </p>
<p>We will likely be completely online soon. </p>
<p>See how people underestimating this situation causes people to lose things?</p>
<p>Exactly, just like people like the ones in this sub are fueling the forced unemployment. </p>
<p>Acting like it's nothing and that our supreme leader up in the oval office knows a single thing about science and pandemics is a sure way to send a country into economic turmoil.</p>

        <p>It is not fetishisation, rather, it is eliminating the problems that arrise from this economic pressure. </p>
<p>I have never seen anyone attack Trump for locking down the flights to China. I have, however, criticized him for misinforming the general public ("this will all go away","don't let it control your lives", etc.) and his lack of action. The US is still banned from flying to many countries while other countries had their ban lifted. Don't you find that a bit weird?</p>
<p>In the debate Trump criticized Biden (I don't support either, both are horrible <em>in my opinion</em>) for wearing a mask and not gathering crowds in a pandemic. He was also all about social distancing and masks during the debates. After he got the virus and survived (jeez no wonder when you have access to the best healthcare as President) he went and called himself a warrior in his ads (remember, becorehand Covid was just some minor thing, now that he had it, he's a warrior) and was basically saying that masks and social distancing don't need to be done since it's infered that it is what he considers "controlling your life." </p>
<p>So that's my take regarding that. </p>
<p>It is a cold or flu for people my age, but it is not to my parents and grandparents. Just because something doesn't hurt me doesn't mean I want to give it to those whom it will hurt. </p>
<p>I am healthy, while my test hasn't come back yet, I'm pretty sure I'm positive as a week ago 2 kids in my class got it. I am healthy but when I take a deep breath you can hear it sounds a bit more restricted. I feel fine and besides a cough and congestion I'm fine, but my mom has lung scaring and a history of a weak immune system. My dad is serving this country in Qatar so currently he is probably fine. Two of my friends' moms are also high risk. </p>
<p>What makes you think I don't have ends to meet? I could be working to support my family for all you know. I would like to keep working but people who roll through the store without masks are putting me at risk of being fired since they can't lose another employee. </p>
<p>This affects everyone which is why it puzzles me as to why people won't wear a piece of cloth over their face when they shop or work.</p>

Why did places like California, Vermont, France have a mask mandate and 2 weeks later cases went up? If they worked that wouldn't of happened </p>

<p>In lower-income settings, it is more likely that reusable cloth masks will be used rather than disposable medical masks because of cost and availability (<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article#r38"><em>38</em></a>). There are still few uncertainties in the practice of face mask use, such as who should wear the mask and how long it should be used for. In theory, transmission should be reduced the most if both infected members and other contacts wear masks, but compliance in uninfected close contacts could be a problem (<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article#r12"><em>12</em></a>,<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article#r34"><em>34</em></a>). Proper use of face masks is essential because improper use might increase the risk for transmission (<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article#r39"><em>39</em></a>). Thus, education on the proper use and disposal of used face masks, including hand hygiene, is also needed. </p>
<p>So it looks like the disposable medical masks may not be effective. This makes sense. I have worn some and there is a lot of gap compared to cloth masks. </p>
<p>However, as with hand hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce the transmission of other infections and therefore have value in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources are stretched. </p>

<h3>Do we support cloth mask wearing where mandated?</h3>
<p>Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face covering to protect them or the people around them. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h3>Is wearing a face covering better than nothing?</h3>
<p>Wearing a cloth mask or face covering could be better than doing nothing, but we simply don’t know at this point. </p>

<p>Masking all providers might limit transmission from these sources by stopping asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic health care workers from spreading virus-laden oral and nasal droplets. </p>

<p>Non-woven masks which passed filtering performance tests had a 100-percent leakage rate when not worn properly. Worn correctly, the leakage rate dropped to about 50 percent.</p>
<p>“How to choose face masks and how to wear them are important,” Onishi noted.</p>
<p>He used special equipment to gauge the protectiveness of masks by measuring the number of particles of more than 0.3 micrometer in the air and the number of particles in the space between masks and faces.</p>
<p>Onishi tested a range of masks: those made from cloth, non-woven masks, dust masks which met the N95 standard and other types, even the “Abenomasks” made of gauze distributed to every household in Japan by the central government.</p>
<p>Given that non-woven masks and dust masks have largely different leakage rates depending on whether they are worn correctly or not, they were compared on the basis of when they were worn casually and perfectly.</p>
<p>Onishi found that cloth and gauze masks had 100-percent leakage rates.</p>
<p>Dust masks had the lowest rate, 1 percent, when they were worn correctly. When they were worn casually, the rate was 6 percent.</p>
<p>With regard to non-woven masks, the type that passed the filtering performance tests had a 52-percent leakage rate when worn correctly. Masks that did not undergo the tests had an 81-percent rate.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This study shows masks work in reducing particle leakage and highlights that not masks are all equal. This is relatively obvious stuff. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong> This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated. </p>

<h3>Die Empfehlung des Robert Koch-Instituts</h3>
<p>Das RKI empfiehlt im Epidemiologischen Bulletin Nr. 19/2020</p>
<p><em>„… ein generelles Tragen einer Mund-Nasen-Bedeckung (MNB) in bestimmten Situationen im öffentlichen Raum als einen weiteren Baustein, um Risikogruppen zu schützen und den Infektionsdruck und damit die Ausbreitungsgeschwindigkeit von COVID-19 in der Bevölkerung zu reduzieren“.</em></p>
<p><em>[Diese Empfehlung beruhe] „auf einer Neubewertung aufgrund der zunehmenden Evidenz, dass ein hoher Anteil von Übertragungen unbemerkt erfolgt, und zwar bereits vor dem Auftreten von Krankheitssymptomen“.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I speak German, they agree masks should be worn and have been shown to help reduce the spread.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong><em>In conclusion from what I have learned from your sources is that N95 masks are the way to go to battle the pandemic. They are effective at stopping the spread of Covid19. Cloth masks have little to no data backing up their effectiveness and the studies that show that they reduce the transmission, also indicate that the cloth masks increase infection rate in the wearer. Therefore, cloth masks should be avoided if possible, however they are better than nothing for reducing the spread. Masks must be tight fitting to properly filter your breath (this is kinda obvious) and must be worn properly. If worn properly, even cloth masks reduced transmission rates (but infection rate was increased according to multiple studies of yours) and medical masks were shown to be too loose fitting to be effective. Medical masks weren't intended to be used as a filtering device anyway, they were intended to be used to prevent fluids from splashing into the wearer's mouth and nose.</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong><em>In conclusion, N95 masks and any masks that can filter particles 3 microns or smaller are very effective in reducing transmission rates as well as infection rates. N95 masks work the best.</em></strong></p>

        <p>The thing is no one wears N95's most wear cloth masks and as some of the sources you listed "improper use could even lead to a higher infection rates with cloth masks" so if cloth masks Arnt effective and if N95 masks are effective you still have that side effects of oxygen reduction and more prone to things like headaches with still not 100% protection </p>
<p>But if the n95 can only filter 0.3 microns and if the coronavirus particle is 0.06-0.12 how is it gonna block it out? </p>
<p>And if cloth and surgical is not suitable then why are people who don't wear masks being harassed and seen as criminals?</p>

<p>Here's a few. Click on the link, locate the study in the large paragraph and click on it. Then click Google Scholar and it brings you the studies on if masks are effective or not when dealing with airborne infections.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We can reopen and in many places, we have. Masks are not 100% effective and not everyone is wearing masks (shout out to anti maskers). Also, masks need to go hand in hand with more frequent hand washing and social distancing. The latter is what makes reopening more challenging. When my school began level 1 which is the level that social distancing no longer works, we went from having 1 case maybe every three days, to having four in a single day.</p>
<p>Plus all it takes is for one guy to take off his mask and cough into his hand. I have taken enough chemistry to see how quickly cross contamination happens.</p>

        <p>It's still not conclusive 
And it only shows "children" to parents but correlation doesn't equal causation as without masks children don't really spread respiratory viruses to elderly people as a whole </p>
<p>And it's not confident in its answer as it said "maybe" protect </p>
<p>And some of the studies only compare surgical masks and respirators 
With no mention of cloth masks or no mask which is what most people are wearing</p>
<p>And used PCR tests to check for virus but according to the inventor of the tests and various studies have showed these tests Arnt suitable for testing for viruses</p>

<p>Conclusion: </p>
<p>We examined the efficacy of face masks and hand hygiene for reducing the incidence of ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza in an open, non-institutionalized population of young adults. Our findings show a significant reduction in the rate of ILI among participants randomized to the face mask and hand hygiene intervention during the latter half of the study period, ranging from 48% to 75% when compared to the control group. We also observed a substantial (43%) reduction in the incidence of influenza infection in the face mask and hand hygiene group compared to the control, but this estimate was not statistically significant. There were no substantial reductions in ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza in the face mask only group compared to the control. Our ILI findings are consistent with results from the first year of this two-year study <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744#pone.0029744-Aiello2">[2]</a> and a previous literature review on studies examining the efficacy of mask use in reducing transmission of respiratory viruses <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744#pone.0029744-Jefferson1">[12]</a>. There are no other mask and hand hygiene intervention studies, to our knowledge, that have examined if wearing a mask prior to illness and jointly practicing hygiene prevents illness for the person practicing the intervention. The majority of earlier studies examined the impact of wearing a mask after a household member had been identified as an ILI or influenza case <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744#pone.0029744-Cowling1">[13]</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744#pone.0029744-MacIntyre1">[14]</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744#pone.0029744-Larson1">[15]</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744#pone.0029744-Canini1">[16]</a>. Our study, therefore, is an important contribution to understanding the effectiveness of these interventions for mitigating influenza outbreaks and possibly pandemic scenarios in crowded and close living environments before outbreaks ensue. </p>
<p>-Average age was around 19 years of age. Doesn't sound like children to me. In this experiment, masks in a practical setting worked. </p>

<p><strong><em>Results</em></strong>. We observed significant reductions in ILI during weeks 4–6 in the mask and hand hygiene group, compared with the control group, ranging from 35% (confidence interval [CI], 9%–53%) to 51% (CI, 13%–73%), after adjusting for vaccination and other covariates. Face mask use alone showed a similar reduction in ILI compared with the control group, but adjusted estimates were not statistically significant. Neither face mask use and hand hygiene nor face mask use alone was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of ILI cumulatively.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusions</em></strong>. These findings suggest that face masks and hand hygiene may reduce respiratory illnesses in shared living settings and mitigate the impact of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic.</p>

<p>In a college setting, masks and hygiene worked. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/0003-4819-151-7-200910060-00142">https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/0003-4819-151-7-200910060-00142</a></p>
<h2>Design:</h2>
<p>Cluster randomized, controlled trial. Randomization was computer generated; allocation was concealed from treating physicians and clinics and implemented by study nurses at the time of the initial household visit. Participants and personnel administering the interventions were not blinded to group assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00425893)</p>
<p>Completely randomized.</p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Hand hygiene and facemasks seemed to prevent household transmission of influenza virus when implemented within 36 hours of index patient symptom onset. These findings suggest that nonpharmaceutical interventions are important for mitigation of pandemic and interpandemic influenza.</p>
<p>It worked.... again. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00205.x">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00205.x</a></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong> Influenza transmission was not reduced by interventions to promote hand washing and face mask use. This may be attributable to transmission that occurred before the intervention, poor facemask compliance, little difference in hand‐washing frequency between study groups, and shared sleeping arrangements. A prospective study design and a careful analysis of sociocultural factors could improve future NPI studies. </p>
<p>So far, the first study to show it didn't work. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And the ones you talked about with respirators v masks were HWC studies. I just added the whole paragraph for your extra information. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They say maybe as the individual studies have a large amount of factors so they must speculate, however, looking at the studies combined, there is a strong correlation, cause and effect, type deal going on where masks and sanitizing decreased infections. </p>
<p>Which study did you look at that only mentioned kids and the respirators? It seems you ignored the studies that were actually focused on what we were talking about: do masks work? </p>
<p>The ones I just listed were in varying settings ranging from the general public, to colleges, to households. That seems to fit a LOT of settings and all except one so far were conclusive and had multiple groups. That's pretty sound data. I'd like to know where you disagree and if you actually read through the studies and didn't just look at the words in the paragraph listed...</p>

<p>The article on PCR tests being accepted forms and that they are accurate when the infection is ongoing. Could you link the original source (not a biased news article) that states that the creator says they are inaccurate? Thanks. Also where did you get this from?:</p>
<p>" as without masks children don't really spread respiratory viruses to elderly people as a whole "</p>
<p>That makes no sense. If you can, please provide a source for that statement. Thanks again. </p>
<p>I am eager to learn more about these topics.</p>
