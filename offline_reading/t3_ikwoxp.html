        <p>The only places that will have any sort of significant wave are those who never had or completed their first wave - so that won't be a second wave but I'm sure the media will say so. There may be locations within countries/states that will have outbreaks that had their wave, but the virus missed these areas. That's still not a second wave. </p>
<p>Quit the fear mongering, media. You don't fear monger over yet another wave of influenza coming each year gotta shutdown!</p>

        <p>The important question right now is how many months of fall and winter it will take before Canadian media and federal and provincial governments admit that the second wave they were hoping for isn’t going to materialize. I’m guessing by Valentine’s Day?</p>

        <p>From a death and hospitalization standpoint, the ‘outbreak’ portion of the pandemic is effectively over and has been for 2-ish + months now steadily. </p>
<p>My guess is, we will see an uptick or cases with back to school, and then another uptick as we hit cold and flu season. Likely an uptick in hospitalizations but if we can keep it out of LTC, deaths should remain fairly flat. </p>
<p>My other guess is that there may be many issues with cold and flu virus reporting mixed into COVID for many reasons. People will be panicked again but locking down will be impossible ethically this time around and there will be backlash. </p>
<p>You can only get away with a lockdown once - when we had no idea what the virus could do. Now, no one will stand for it. </p>
<p>My best guess is this ends by April of next year all and all.</p>
