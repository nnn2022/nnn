        <p>It's maddening how this system works. Even if they are being completely unbiased and objective in their review, it would be insanely difficult to conclusively determine that the vaccine was the sole cause of death after-the-fact, with innumerable variables at play. It's hard enough within a clinical trial. Regardless, there's enough of a causal relationship here that they should be pausing all vaccines, not just AZ and JNJ. Every party involved has too much skin in the game for this to go catastrophically wrong. We need to remove all conflicts of interest and start over.</p>

        <p>Look no further than some of the top commentary on social media when the j&amp;j pause was announced: its ok if a few die or suffer for the greater good (one journalist went as far to say they would be happy to die from the vaccines). This is compounded even more so now that the vaccine serves as a dangling carrot in front of the path back to old normal. It's quite the predicament. I am encouraged by a lot of the conversation taking place around these issues, seems like less and less people just blindly following.</p>

<p>I thought this reasoning for COVID made us cold, heartless killers? We just don't care about grandma? Sure, the ~~vaccine~~ virus might not kill us, but what about the elderly or "immunocompromised"?</p>
<p>Plus, VAERS only accounts for around 1% of adverse reactions to vaccines. Now, calling it genocide is a stretch, but a 0.002% death rate is the same as the IFR of COVID for young people.</p>

        <p>Why did they round .001652% down to .0016% when everyone knows at 5 you round up? Why are they using number of doses when they calculate that number instead of using the number of people that had the vaccine administered?</p>
<p>It feels like every time they want to warp statistics, they use poor practices to downplay the adverse events associated with the vaccine while playing up the issues related to SARS2. I think this subs logic can better be described as my body my choice, and violating my bodily autonomy through coercion is a human rights violation and using these deceptive practices as seen on the CDC website robs people of the ability to give informed consent.</p>
<p>Can you please help me figure out how to use the website to actually compare SARS2 to the vaccines based on demographic and comorbidity groups so that I can understand if I am at higher risk from the vaccine than the virus?</p>
<p>I am under the age of 40 and I have a comorbidity, I take vitamin D regularly, and I exercise regularly. My understanding is that all of these things have been proved to decrease the risk of serious complications with SARS2 while there is also evidence to suggest these things increase my risk with regard to taking a vaccine for SARS2. I would genuinely love to have the answer to this question and have tried, but to this point I have been unsuccessful. I appreciate any help you can provide on the matter.</p>

        <p>Not sure exactly what rounding you’re referring to, but I know the 130 million vaccinated people stat I used was individuals who have gotten one or more shots, not vaccines administered which is like 211 million I believe.</p>
<p>I see where you’re coming from about the bodily autonomy and my body my choice stuff, the issue I think is that it becomes a lot more complex when a virus would likely be fine if you got it but you risk spreading to others, potentially taking their right to be alive.  </p>
<p>I don’t think I can help you with comparing those sort of stats, sorry this really isn’t my field.</p>
<p>What I can offer, is the idea that according to the data we have from VAERS and the regular CDC, your chances of dying from the virus exceed your chances of dying from the vaccine by a factor of like 100.</p>

        <p>3486/211,000,000, specifically the switch would have to be at 211,272,727, but somehow I find it hard to believe when they choose to mislead on so many other issues as well.</p>
<p>&rt;I see where you’re coming from about the bodily autonomy and my body my choice stuff, the issue I think is that it becomes a lot more complex when a virus would likely be fine if you got it but you risk spreading to others, potentially taking their right to be alive. </p>
<p>If you are pro-abortion, which is ending the life of a fetus, something that has been very clearly denied personhood by the courts, but is very clearly alive based on the scientific definition of a living organism, it seems completely reasonable that their right to life stops IMMEDIATELY when it interferes with my body.  If they do not want to get sick from me, then they can "stay the fuck home", isn't that how the saying goes?</p>
<p>&rt;I don’t think I can help you with comparing those sort of stats, sorry this really isn’t my field. </p>
<p>Honestly, I didn't expect you to be able to, I expected it was much more likely that the other promise you made of:</p>
<p>&rt;If you want me to help you figure out how to use the website to view and understand the actual numbers, please ask! </p>
<p>was less than sincere because it feels like the Followers of the Church of COVID/Fauci claim to believe in the Science, but do not actually take the time to look at the actual numbers, which I have taken a decent amount of time to look at it because it does overlap significantly with my area of expertise.</p>
<p>&rt;What I can offer, is the idea that according to the data we have from VAERS and the regular CDC, your chances of dying from the virus exceed your chances of dying from the vaccine by a factor of like 100. </p>
<p>This is your Fauci Pseudoscience showing because you completely ignored my point about breakdowns of risk by age and comorbidities as well as behaviors known to increase/decrease risk of various things.  If you take a random person in a vacuum, then the factor of 100 is completely true.  However, you should never take data in a vacuum.  Imagine if I used data only from say August to November to predict how much daylight we would have in May of the following year.  Due to global darkening, I could say that we would actually have a negative amount of daylight each day!  Obviously, this would be completely idiotic and meaningless, which is exactly how I feel when people tell me the chances of dying from the vaccine vs the virus is lower by a factor of 100.</p>
<p>The chances of a person over 80 dying from the virus are a factor of more than 100 higher than someone under the age of 40.  However, we also know that the chances of having adverse events in general from most of the vaccines are actually lower for people over 80 than under 40, and I am assuming that a similar proportion is true with causes of deaths.  However, this is obviously incredibly to tease out for real because just like dying with COVID is different than dying because of it, the same is true for the vaccines.  People over 80 frequently die, its just one of those things that happens, so knowing whether the vaccine caused the deaths in those cases or not can be very difficult.  Perhaps any knowledge of how people over 80 respond to the vaccine is entirely irrelevant in being able to determine when deaths are caused in people under 40 because their immune systems respond differently to the vaccines, therefore, they would not have similar causes of death as a result of the vaccines.</p>
<p>The problem is that many people like you (perhaps not you specifically, and sorry if I come off a bit condescending, but it is frustrating at times) like to write off the legitimate concerns of people like me as the ravings of a mad man, when the reality is that I am taking considerably more time to look at the numbers on this the best I can given that we do not know all of the information, and make the best decision for myself given what is known.  When people suggest that my actions are going to result in the deaths of others, people who choose of their own volition to leave their homes, I find it incredibly disturbing that they are willing to do it with such ease in that they do not actually know with any certainty that what they are claiming is true.  You do not know that the vaccine is safer by a factor of 100 for people under the age of 40 as compared to if they are to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.  </p>
<p>Based on the evidence I have seen, I would guess that children that have not yet hit puberty are actually a factor of 100 less likely to die from getting SARS-CoV-2 than to take the vaccine, and that people under 40 fall somewhere between a factor of 100 and 10 safer to get the virus rather than a vaccine.  Although, perhaps if they were just to get 1 dose instead of 2, that might be safer overall for this group.  Then in the group of 40-65, somewhere along the way you would find a flux point, similar in concept to what I was referring to with the number of 211,272,727, where the vaccine becomes better than the virus.</p>
<p>The age brackets may strike you as odd, but it has to do with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is so extremely skewed to killing older people, whereas the vaccine seems to have a somewhat constant rate of killing people regardless of age.  Although again, I suspect there are more of the older deaths that are likely to be attributed to the vaccines that really are not vaccine related than you would see among the younger deaths, which would mean that the vaccines actually kills younger people at a higher rate than it kills older people.</p>
<p>Just to reiterate on the human rights violation stuff, if you are telling me that I have to sign a waver to get a vaccine because it is only permitted because of emergency usage procedures and these companies providing the vaccines are immune to lawsuits related to said vaccines because they do not already know all the possible negative outcomes, then anything you do to limit my behaviors if I do not take a vaccine is a form of coercion which is quite simple a violation of human rights.  This was determined internationally as a result of the way Nazis would perform experiments to prevent anything like that from happening again.  Unfortunately, it appears too many people failed to learn that part of history and now that the generation that was there has virtually died off, it seems people like you write it off with statistics like ".000082% death rate vaccine“, completely oblivious to the idea that the genocide is in the fact that they are taking away our right to decide for ourselves what happens with our bodies.</p>
<p>Since obesity is a huge factor in severe COVID, that means that anyone that is obese should be much more concerned with changing the things in their own behavior if they do not want to die of COVID or suffer serious long term complications.  I can assure you that those people will reduce their risk much more significantly by doing that than by forcing someone like me to get a vaccine.  The difference is they can be responsible for their own actions and outcomes, and I can be responsible for my own actions and outcomes.  </p>
<p>You can even say I am selfish, but you know what, that is 100% true, I am selfish.  I make well above the median income where I live, but I do not donate away my income to take myself down to the median income because I am selfish, and I work hard for my income and I enjoy my own income.  Perhaps some of it was by luck, but if you try to regulate and dictate the outcomes of every last person to be "fair", all you're going to do is end up in authoritarianism where everyone gets the "same" outcome.</p>

        <p>Alright we are going to be working with a few assumptions here.
1. CDC is reputable 
2. Basic mathematics hold true
So using the data provided in this photo there are 211 million administered vaccines in a four month time period. There is a 3486/211 millionths chance of dying in these four months. Simplified this is 0.000016 or 0.0016% percent chance of dying after getting a vaccine. This checks out. Now using another CDC stat we can see that YEARLY there are 869.7 deaths per 100,000 people in the US. Using proportions we can set 869.7/100,000=x/211,000,000, where x is equal to number of expected deaths in a year using the population of 211,000,000 people. Solving gives us x=1,835,067. Dividing this by three to account for the fact that it is a yearly statistic and that the vaccine numbers have been counted by a third of that time show us that the expected death toll for these 211,000,000 people in four months is 611,689 people. The reason the number is so low compared to the estimated stat is because not all people will report someone dead as a result of adverse effects. Therefore, this number is actually a fraction of the people who have died after getting the shot, but it is INCREDIBLY unlikely that any of it is an actual side effect. Do your research</p>
