    <strong>Dystopia in my School</strong>
    <p><p>The level of COVID control in my school system is frankly insane. We received the option about a month ago to go in-person or remain online and the teachers teach both the online and in-person students at the same time. Even though my school is incredibly strict on mask-wearing, I decided it would be better to be masked and in-person than receive a low-quality online education. </p>
<p>For starters, every week my parents and I have to fill out a virtual form that requests information about recent possible COVID interactions I’ve had. They recommend each student complete daily temperature checks at home before coming to school. I don’t. Every day, to enter the school building, we have to scan a QR code upon entering the building to show which entrance we entered, and then I have to hand sanitize. Whenever I enter a classroom as well, I have to scan a QR code at the desk I sit at, that way they know where I’m sitting. Since they haven’t done anything about QR code scanning, I just don’t do it. However, the mask-wearing propaganda is ridiculous. One day, to test what would happen, I showed up without a mask. They didn’t let me enter the building until I put on the free mask they gave me. Additionally, every day before lunch they tell us the few locations we are allowed to eat lunch and they say something along the lines of “We thank everyone for wearing their masks above their nose the entire day.” In the classrooms, every desk is spread out 6 feet apart all facing in one direction. The cafeteria is so ridiculous. They’ve removed all tables and replaced them with desks, which are all 6 feet apart and facing one direction so I’m just staring at the back of people’s heads. </p>
<p>They recently released some information about plans for reopening in the fall and all they’ve said is any summer school classes will still require masks and they are asking us to “keep our schools and communities safe” by getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>Additionally, what I find extra amusing about this whole thing is that in December 2019, a sickness swept through my entire school, and it was to the point, that in my classes, more than half the class was gone for the entire week. I was stuck in bed for about 6 days because of it and so were many of my friends. My school completely ignored that sickness and told us all to catch up on our missing work, but for a disease that has a 99.997% survival rate for our age group we’ve been online for over a year and just now are returning to a completely masked environment.</p></p>

        <p>My wife is a teacher at a school like this. It’s been essentially normal the whole time aside from a few weeks in March 2020. No distancing rules, no online class, no masks.</p>
