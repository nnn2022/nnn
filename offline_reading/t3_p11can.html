    <strong>Workplace implements a Covid-19 vaccination policy, but do we have a vaccine by definition?</strong>
    <p><p>Every definition of vaccine I find has the work "immunity" in it. "A substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide <strong><em>immunity</em></strong> against one or several diseases". By that definition, we do not have a vaccine. The three current options in the states are <strong>symptom suppressors</strong>. They do not provide immunity to Covid-19 and people who have gotten the shot still get the virus and spread the virus. They are not immune. The mounting breakthrough cases prove that.</p>
<p>In Law, words matter. Definitions of words matter. If a workplace issue a Covid-19 vaccination mandate, by the definition of the word vaccine, there are none. There is no current shot that will give you immunity. </p>
<p>Polio has a vaccine. Measles has a vaccine. They don't call the annual flu shot a vaccine, because it isn't.</p></p>

        <p>I suppose so, but they had to change the definition of vaccine to do it.</p>
<p>Also it is a gene therapy, but went through vaccine testing standards, not gene therapy testing.</p>

        <p>the FDA and CDC an other countries health department changed the very definition of vaccine. The CDC even changed the definition of herd immunity!</p>
<p>One of the most insane thing I ever seen Boom its changed! And the entire world played along in the delusion.</p>

        <p>If you've had covid, you likely still have antibodies. Test for it to prove your immunity, rather than getting vaxxed?</p>

        <p>You’re correct, it’s not a vaccine if it doesn’t provide immunity. It doesn’t even prevent spread. The CDC defines immunity as: “<em>Protection from an infectious disease. If you are immune to a disease, you can be exposed to it without becoming infected</em>.”  And defines vaccines as: “<em>A product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease</em>”. (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/imz-basics.htm">reference</a> )</p>
<p>I’d definitely give that argument a try. You’ll have to compile CDC, FDA, and/or vaccine manufacturer statements that admit it only suppresses symptoms if you want to convince a court or HR department. It doesn’t matter that vaccine technology has now (potentially) evolved past the traditional method of injecting weakened viruses, that’s part of medical advancement...the fact that it doesn’t provide any protection to anyone beyond symptom suppression is what makes it a non-vaccine. It’s a preemptive treatment at most.</p>
