        <p>It takes forever for the body to move enough of it to the rest of the body or brain in two hours let alone two days. First signs show up in about two weeks..... much of the tablet is starch to help the digestion. Absolutely 0 chance of any effect of a Mag tablet helping that fast... if it did work, it was all in their head. </p>
<p>Fun fact, brain fog can temporarily be fixed by sheer metal fortitude (placebos are one such way to trick the brain into it), but it most likely will return worse afterwords. Think of it like running a car on low gas, it sputters more at lower rpm, but seems to run better when you push it a bit, only to it get even worse when the gas flow thins even more. They probably tricked their brain into working harder, and probably will experience a crash.</p>

        <p>Logical and measured response would be thinking that the governments tell the truth, never profit from crisis, never deliberately prolong the crisis to profit from it for longer, never spread strawman fallacies to smear its critics, never massage the data, never actually cause death if it would benefit them and they wouldn't be caught. The same governments that claim that people who were in traffic accidents died of covid, people who fell of a ladder died of covid, people with negative tests died of covid, people who had multiple late stage cardiovascular and oncologic diseases died of covid. Who is doing mental gymnastics?</p>

        <p>I know of large companies that benefited from this because they deal in goods distribution, but i dont know of any government that benefits from lockdowns or economic measures.</p>
<p>Also, stop discrediting people with chronic ilnesses dying from covid. Covid causes acute symptoms, versus chronic ones that can get treated over time. If a car hits a person with a weak heart, or a cancer patient, surely those conditions dont help in treatment, but the person would ultimativelyived longer had they not been hit. Same with covid. Chronic patients that cought it would have loved longer otherwise.</p>

<p>Healthy young people constitute a very small subset of all deaths, so there is that.</p>
<p>&rt;Governments risk a lot of unrest.</p>
<p>Crushed and rooted it out so far. If tyranny would always result in unrest, Hitler and Stalin would not have become infamous in the first place. If the governments didn't have this crisis to shield themselves, they may have faced even bigger unrest because of stagnating economy, increasing inequality, enlargement of security state and general sense of decadence, stasis and commonplace injustice, which were so conveniently shadowed by quasi-war and emergency rhetoric.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, what is the point of vaccination which is proven to work? Why would they want the crisis to end?</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to end, does it? They don't want it to end, since they have to find the new ways to prop up their power and possibly even face the change in leadership. And it won't end, since infections and deaths will rise at the time they rise every year regardless. I think they had promised that by now it will be over, but I can't be sure since I didn't pay close attention to empty promises.</p>

<p>Places with high vaccination rates have relaxed all measures compared to when the only measures have been not exposing yourself. I'm not a doomer, I believe that in western countries the bulk of the crisis is over.</p>

<p>Israel: mask still required, just like in summer 2020</p>
<p>Canada: still states of emergency</p>
<p>Netherlands: new measures implemented</p>
<p>When the respiratory disease season comes, who is going to protest against very possible new lockdowns, aside from the skeptics?</p>
<p>&rt;Just because I'm at lower risk doesn't mean that should I stop caring about those that constitue the majority of fatalities.</p>
<p>This is not about care. When I say some people's death are unrelated to covid doesn't mean they are expendable or something. It just means governments manipulate statistics.</p>
