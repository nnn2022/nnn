    <strong>Tristan da Cunha- a place where, if one case of covid arises, will be proof this is all a scam</strong>
    <p><p>This remote island that belongs to the UK has had no cases, of course there is no way the virus could get there given how difficult it is to get there on normal times. </p>
<p>The island has some 200 something people and it’s closest inhabited place is another remote island more than 1,000 miles away. They have received no tourists since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Often I search to see if the island had gotten a case of covid because if it does, then that is it- this is all a hoax. For now I believe the virus exists but you simply cannot test positive for something that has no way to get there. Is the same as traveling to the past- to the 90’s for example and someone tests positive for covid.</p></p>
