    <strong>As long as covid restrictions don't get banned I think any business that still has them in place will continue to keep them around.</strong>
    <p><p>I firmly believe if we don't see states doing what Florida is with how their are reopening it won't surprise me if businesses continue making customers wear masks. Unless something major happens where there are riots going on or protests against the business. Especially on social media sites. Good lord businesses theses days are so scared to go against the covid restrictions, because social media has taken over and will bash any company for doing so.</p>
<p>As long as the majority is still supportive with wearing masks I don't see many businesses dropping them. Our greatest bet for return to normal is for more and more people to wake up and for there to be a movement against the restrictions on social media. Though social media tends to take down posts that are against restrictions for "misinformation".</p></p>

        <p>We should let them take us to court just live your life normally when you get a fine for doing that tell them you're not gonna pay them and they should have to take you to court, The more people start doing this the more people that punishes you for living normal will start to realize they are the ones who are wrong.</p>
<p>They are the ones breaking the constitution they should be more worried for a trial then us and if enough people keep doing this we can even put these people to Nuremberg Trial.</p>

<p>These businesses are smug now but market forces can be vicious once they turn against you.</p>
