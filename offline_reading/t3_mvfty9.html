    <strong>The Problem VS The Solution</strong>
    <p><p><strong>The CDC mortality rates are significantly overestimated.</strong><br>
In October 2020 the WHO stated that worldwide infections of COVID we're likely above 700 Million. At the time, only 35 Million infections were recognized. While this was meant as further fearmongering, we can deduce what this really means. It suggests 20x more people were infected, which would make the mortality rate 20x less.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foreigner.fi/articulo/coronavirus/who-estimates-that-more-than-700-million-people-have-caught-covid-19/20201005182746008288.html">https://www.foreigner.fi/articulo/coronavirus/who-estimates-that-more-than-700-million-people-have-caught-covid-19/20201005182746008288.html</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>^(CDC COVID Survival Rates)</strong><br>
0-19 ^(YEARS) 99.997% <br>
20-49 ^(YEARS) 99.98% <br>
50-69 ^(YEARS) 99.95% <br>
70+ ^(YEARS) 94.6%  </p>
<p><strong>^(Adjusted COVID Survival Rates)</strong> <br>
0-19 ^(YEARS) 99.99985% <br>
20-49 ^(YEARS) 99.999% <br>
50-69 ^(YEARS) 99.975% <br>
70+ ^(YEARS) 99.73%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course the 20x more infections are more likely to have been concentrated in younger age groups. Which means if you're under 70, unless you have significant comorbidities, the experimental vaccines pose a much greater risk to you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>According to a Harvard study (page 6): "<strong>fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported</strong>"</p>
<p><a href="https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf">https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As of April 8th, the US has reported 68,347 cases of adverse reactions to COVID vaccines. If the Harvard study is correct, that number should be multiplied by 100, making it closer to 6.8M immediate and short term adverse reactions (long term side effects can take years).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&amp;GROUP1=CAT&amp;EVENTS=ON&amp;VAX=COVID19">https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&amp;GROUP1=CAT&amp;EVENTS=ON&amp;VAX=COVID19</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>37.1% of the US population has received at least one shot (as of April 15th). 37.1% of 330.2M Population = about 122.5M people vaccinated.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>6.8M divided by 122.5M = 5.551% of people vaccinated have had adverse reactions (ranging from a mild headache to instant death). And this is while reported vaccine side effects lag a week behind reported vaccinations (so the percentage of reactions should be higher).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, deaths from vaccines are a lot harder to estimate. As of April 8th, the US has 2,602 reported deaths. So do we multiple that by 100 and assume we already have 260k vaccine deaths? You might think that wouldn't be the case as deaths must be more likely to be reported. However, this article was interesting:</p>
<p><a href="https://cbs12.com/news/nation-world/utah-woman-39-dies-4-days-after-2nd-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-autopsy-ordered">https://cbs12.com/news/nation-world/utah-woman-39-dies-4-days-after-2nd-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-autopsy-ordered</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>“Did the vaccine cause this? I think that would be very hard to demonstrate in autopsy," he said.</em></p>
<p><em>Erik can think of only one instance where you would see a vaccine as the cause of death on an official autopsy report and that would be in an immediate case of Anaphylaxis. One where a person received the vaccine and died almost instantaneously.</em></p>
<p>“Short of that” he said, “it would be difficult for us to definitively say this is the vaccine.”</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am not a doctor, this is not health advice, only an observation and showing of my concern being much greater towards the solution than the problem.</p></p>

        <p>This is troubling to me, the way they play sides with the virus and the vaccine. With the virus, EVERY death where a person had even been <em>suspected</em> of having covid, was labeled as a covid death. Now with the vaccine, even though it's pretty damn obvious if it caused the death, they back track and say it's not likely, or would be hard to prove. I'm really not surprised by this at all, and would expect nothing less. What troubles me, is how blind people are to it and. How easily they just eat up every lie they're told. I swear, the great majority of people are just totally clueless to any form of common sense and rational thinking.</p>

        <p>Those numbers are inflated due to designations of "with COVID" rather than "from COVID". And 260k people in the US alone may have already died from the experimental vaccines. Which if correct, experiment vaccine deaths are already significantly outpacing deaths from COVID. Unfortunately, we'll probably never know the true casualties of either. Vaccine deaths are significantly under reported, while COVID deaths are significantly over reported.</p>

        <p>No, it is not a lie. You're repeating the propaganda media mantra of "zero evidence" while not making any attempt to actually look for or look at the evidence, open your eyes!</p>
<p>VAERS data updated on Friday with a huge spike. Previous data was from December 14th until April 1st, which had 56,869 reported vaccine reactions. The data has been updated until April 23rd. There has now been 118,902 reported adverse covid vaccine reactions in the US. In just 3 weeks of additional data, they've more than doubled over 3 months of reported covid vaccine adverse reactions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&amp;GROUP1=CAT&amp;EVENTS=ON&amp;VAX=COVID19">https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&amp;GROUP1=CAT&amp;EVENTS=ON&amp;VAX=COVID19</a>  </p>
<p>As mentioned in the original post, according to a Harvard study: "<strong>fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported</strong>"  </p>
<p>So the actual adverse events are likely closer to 11,890,200. Of course those range from a mild headache all the way to death. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The reported serious adverse events are now 12,619. So, potentially 1,261,900 serious side effects so far. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&amp;GROUP1=AGE&amp;EVENTS=ON&amp;VAX=COVID19&amp;SERIOUS=ON">https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&amp;GROUP1=AGE&amp;EVENTS=ON&amp;VAX=COVID19&amp;SERIOUS=ON</a>  </p>
<p>You might think, more people are just being vaccinated, but that's not the case. About 10% of the population has been vaccinated every month and a half, and that's remained fairly consistent. Even second vaccinations have remained consistent. So what is with such a massive spike in adverse reactions?  </p>
<p>It is very concerning especially since we haven't passed near enough time to even begin to see long term side effects. Long term effects like the ones we saw with every single attempted coronavirus vaccine from 1960 through 2016. Every single one has failed, resulting in horrible long term effects such as pathogenic priming, lung disease and death.</p>
