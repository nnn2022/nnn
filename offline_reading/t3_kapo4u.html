    <strong>Where is this all going?</strong>
    <p><p>My state just announced a curfew.  What is that about? The only info I can find so far on curfews is they did it to Jews in the holocaust.   This is no doubt going to lead to 24 hour stay at home orders.  But why?  After the stay at home orders become normal, what is the next thing they are going to impose?</p></p>

        <p>Here's what I think we have to look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li>No jab, no job</li>
<li>No jab, no store</li>
<li>No jab, no plane</li>
<li>Mass unemployment leading to a centrally planned state (with those that destroyed our economy at the helm)</li>
<li>More forced drugs into our bodies</li>
<li>No more pesky middle class to meddle in high affairs</li>
<li>You can't see your friends or family (wouldn't want you to have non-tech company approved conversations)</li>

        <p>Democrats are certainly more at fault, but don’t kid yourself, both sides are rotten and are responsible here. In fact, amongst Republican governors, I can only think of two that are not actively trying to destroy their state (Noem and DeSantis).</p>

        <p>Look, those billionaire corporations are not going anywhere. In fact they support YOUR ideas. You guys are cheering them on while they decimate normal people. They don't want there to be a middle class that is independent who can one day challenge them. They will be happy to pay you $15/hr, pay for you to wait in line for basic medical care, give you free indoctrination classes at college as long as they still have billions of dollars and you be a good slave. There will be a wealth gap so large you won't even believe it.</p>

        <p>Everything that has happened up to now, conservative domination of the government starting in the 1980s, has led to the largest wealth gap ever, larger than any economist predicted. What exactly is it that liberals are going to do, in your mind, that could possibly be worse for the wealth gap, than what we have now?</p>

        <p>I see them taxing out middle class millionaires and making barriers to entry to where no one can start their own business so we all will have to work for corporations for $15/hr while they provide bare necessities making it impossible to ever get out of. Again, the ultra elite billionaires are in control they're not going to redistribute their wealth to anyone unless you force them at gun point or kill them. The conservatives are consistently for smaller government and lower taxes. Half the nation doesn't even pay taxes so I'm not for my money going to those people. Also, as it currently stands, If you have the ability you can become a millionaire and even a billionaire like elon musk. Under liberals I believe they will tax the incentive right out of anyone from ever trying to contribute anything more than the bare minimum while implementing so much government overreach that extraordinary people won't be able to reach their full potential. Useless people will still contribute nothing and be given even more benefits while people who work are forced to foot the bill. All the while those billionaire ultra elites will hoard all the wealth and continue to write laws.</p>

        <p>I am a millionaire. I may call myself “middle class” or “upper middle class” or may “feel” middle class, but by no measure am I actually middle class. The <em>median</em> household wealth in the US is ~$97,000. Yet the <em>average</em> wealth is $672,000. I hope I don’t have to explain how that reflects the wealth disparity in and of itself.  The top 20% in America control 85% of its wealth. If your net worth, like mine, is at least $1,000,000, you have more wealth than 99.5% of Americans. </p>
<p>In other words, by measure of wealth, it is not possible to be a millionaire and also be middle class. And the fact that you think that reflects what a number conservatives have done on the minds of the American people. So your first proposition is just nonsensical and illogical. </p>
<p>But let’s talk tax policy. Let’s talk about the real middle class. Median household income in the US is ~70,000, so let’s call that smack dab in the middle of middle class. The tax cuts passed by the republicans placed permanent tax cuts in place for the very wealthy and corporations. But if you make under $75,000, those tax cuts were temporary and begin to expire in 2021 (starting from the bottom up, hilariously). So, when you think about who is fucking the <em>actual</em> middle class in the eye, look to the right, not to the left. </p>
<p>The current proposals from the “left” (Joe Biden, infamous leftist) suggests increasing taxes on those with income greater than $400,000. Only in America could people making over $400,000 a year cast themselves as victims. </p>
<p>I’m gonna stop there and not dig into your other points for now, because based just on this part of your beliefs, and the oxymoron you opened with, your perspective has been grossly skewed by rightist propaganda. I suggest you go and look at job growth and unemployment rates at the beginning and the end of every Republican and Democratic president since Eisenhower, then get back to me.</p>

        <p>Are you trying to make a point? Because your last few points were clearly based on faulty reasoning. Which I suppose is why you’ve chosen to completely change the subject. But hey, it’s a free country, so you can do that. Another thing you can do in a free country is move at will between states, depending on your ability to compete in that regional  economy. </p>
<p>There are many reasons people move between states, and in the cases of New York and California, they have some things in common, but many more things that separate them. </p>
<p>Obviously using terms like “fleeing” just betray your bias and unwillingness to recognize that the reason people might move from one place to another is multi-factorial and almost never due to one factor. And let’s also note that the places people “flee” to are becoming more, not less, liberal, as a result of their migration. So it’s not the liberalness they’re fleeing, but rather they are moving to someplace where their skills and education have more value. </p>
<p>I’m guessing you’re attempting to make a point about taxation. And I can only guess, since you haven’t made a claim. </p>
<p>Both New York and California are high-tax states. They’re also both high-income states with very high qualities of life. Good healthcare, outstanding university systems, low crime, good environmental standards, etc, etc. </p>
<p>We should also approach your question from the perspective that in the case of California, the more recent domestic migration deficit follows decades of <em>massive</em> inbound domestic migration. Let’s also note that throughout its history, including until today, even with the last decade of domestic outbound migration, the total population has increased, and it has increased at a higher rate than the national average. This is important as it is integral to the housing demand and cost of living. </p>
<p>All of these desirable traits makes makes both CA and NY high cost of living states. It’s really a supply and demand issue. I would say that in the case of California, the downward pressure of housing costs and higher taxes play a different (and greater) role than they do in New York. That’s because in California the high cost <em>and</em> high income is more well-distributed, while in New York it’s heavily concentrated around NYC. </p>
<p>I’d say we should set New York aside for the purposes of the point I assume you are trying to make, because the reason more people might leave than come in probably has more to do with the climate and the fact that many of the people leaving are older and on fixed incomes (no longer of working age), so the higher earning potential no longer appeals to people in that category. For California we can remove climate as a reason to move out, since it’s climate is obviously very desirable. </p>
<p>So, anyway, the answer to your question, is that there are a lot of reasons people might leave a state like California which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>high cost of living</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>high taxes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>low income earning potential based on their educational status and skill level - put simply, their skills are not compatible with California’s economy’s demands. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Per the above, places like Texas have industries, for example the oil and wind industries, which have a higher demand for both skilled and unskilled manual labor - fields with plenty of jobs that don’t require higher education. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>California is a transient state, many people came from somewhere else and are returning to where they came from, or did not have deep roots in place and thus were more readily able to leave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they were seeking opportunities they were unable to find in California</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>California had become overpopulated, which placed a lot of pressure on housing costs (this due to the massive inbound migration through 2010, and the natural population growth) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact is, the people leaving California tend to be poorer, have less education, and basically cannot afford to live in California and would be able to have a higher QOL in places like Texas. Really, that’s the ultimate reason. So while to you it may look like “liberal paradise” reasons may be why people leave, it’s really mote a matter of not being able to compete in its economy. </p>
<p>Lucky for them, America is a free country and people can move around to pursue economic opportunities. And that’s how capitalism works. If the place you’re living doesn’t have enough demand for your skills, you’ll need to either increase your skills and education, or move somewhere where your existing skills are in demand. </p>
<p>And by the way, nice straw man you set up with your question. I never said anything about NY or CA, or them being “liberal dream states” - I just pointed out that if it’s over taxation of the middle class you’re concerned about, I’d take a closer look at the actual Republican legislative measures and ignore the propaganda they’ve been shouting at you your whole life.</p>

        <p>I changed subjects because you seem educated and I just like to hear other's perspectives. I'd also say youre right in a lot of it. Sure California and NY are both pretty places, lots of money in the big cities but high crime is balanced out by the smaller conservative rural areas. The cities are cesspits of homelessness and depravity. You know this too. It's not as bad in Texas but places like Austin and Houston are starting to look that way with tent cities. They're also the most liberal places in the state. </p>
<p>It's not just the republican legislation on taxation that I prefer, it's the entire way their cities look compared to liberal ones. San Diego and Miami, both run by republican mayors, they're both distinctly cleaner with less homeless running around than NYC and LA. I'm not attributing that to just the mayors either. The people in those places are more conservative in their beliefs. In fact during the Floyd riots it was only the conservative big cities that had no riots in them. You answered my question, though. You fluffed the good parts of those states while admitting they're not good for low income people. So in my perspective those low income people move to places like my beloved Texas, increase housing prices, change voting demographics and implement the same toxic values that they fled from. And yes, there's articles on people "fleeing" these places. While the rich stay with a massive wealth gap. I understand it's transient but people aren't moving in there now. </p>
<p>Not like this was a "gotcha" tactic you said what I already know but you have a different perspective on it. To you it's beneficial but to me I dread every time I have to travel to a big liberal city. Knowing everything is going to be expensive, the people are less friendly, I have to be unarmed traveling in high crime areas. It's not the republican propaganda that has me fooled. Its first hand experience and obvious visual, social, and economic differences.</p>

        <p>Quit your robotic parroting of socialist screed.  Corporations and wealth are results of this country being free and they're wonderful.  Under the government control of socialism, you most definitely are not free.</p>

        <p>They're are one in the same. I agree. We should have small government and let businesses run wild. That's where the best inventions of all time have come from. Have you not noticed the government has completely taken over our lives this past year? This isn't even a conspiracy anymore these people at the top have all admitted in one way or another what they're planning. It's either are you for the great reset or against it.</p>

        <p>Buddy, you must have TDS.  Not everything is about Trump.  Because someone is against socialism/statism/communism/government takeover of business (whatever name you want to call it by) doesn't mean they're a Trump supporter.  We can view where these trends are heading, how leftists are using this virus to advance pet political, financial, and social agendas that will only lead to destruction, desperation, and possible tyranny.  We refuse to be like Australia.  I'm all for mask wearing; this isn't just about masks.  It's about business shutdowns which is pure government overreach.</p>

        <p>He fucking denied covid not because he believed it. He is on tape saying he knew it would be devastating and lots of people would die. He denied covid to keep the stocks from falling. He traded over 250k lives to make sure he looked good. And you dummies bend over backwards to deny covid cuz he said it was a hoax. And then the mf got covid and spread it to everyone in his admin. But yea, it’s all a plan to track your identity.</p>
<p>You are talking about small business? 4 Trillion fucking dollars went to big corps and small business got fucked. What a great guy. You act like that is liberals fault because Trump can do no wrong and the deep state is controlling it. If that’s true, he is shit leader and if it isn’t he is a shit human. Get some fuckin brains.</p>

        <p>The ONLY thing you can find about curfews is that it happened to Jews in Nazi Germany? </p>
<p>Nothing about curfews since then?</p>
<p>Jesus dude there were curfews over the protests this past summer.</p>
