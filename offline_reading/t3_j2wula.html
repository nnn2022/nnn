    <strong>Grateful for this sub</strong>
    <p><p>Sometime I feel like the world is becoming so  irrational and at such a fast rate, it‚Äôs hard to to find likeminded people. Today I walked into a shop and was putting on my mask as I walked through the doors, but I had my hands full and was struggling to get my mask all the way on. This man came RUNNING at me yelling, ‚ÄúNo no no no no no no no no!! Why isn‚Äôt yours mask on?! Get out!!‚Äù I told him I was trying to put it on and he yelled ‚ÄúBut why aren‚Äôt you wearing one outside?!‚Äù. You can‚Äôt win with these people... It‚Äôs relieving to look at this sub and know I‚Äôm not alone in this insanity. Because there‚Äôs no other way to describe it. This is completely crazy.</p></p>

        <p>Good.  It would have crushed my soul to stay after that kind of treatment.  Some people are psychotic over masks and the ridiculous, arbitrary mandates.</p>
<p>I was at the post office a few weeks ago waiting in line. Wearing my mask, social distanced and all.  Workers behind a plexiglass kind of barrier.  A woman was making her purchase and mailing her parcels, talking the postal worker's head off like some people do.  All of a sudden she stopped talking, apologized to the worker profusely, turned around and apologized over and over to us in line too because she didn't have a mask on and had just realized this.  Like, melt down.  We're all at least six feet apart or whatever they have marked on the floor.  Plexiglass like I said.  The woman acted as if she had committed a crime and had doomed us all.  That's what the media has done, and our leaders, turned people into neurotic lunatics over masks and whatnot.</p>

        <p>I can't stomach the media anymore.  On our local news, which I used to like, the reporters all wear masks even though no one is around except a cameraman however far away and I can't understand a garbled word they say.</p>
<p>Yep, lepers and plague rats.  Even though I do not know one single person who has died from coronavirus or even anyone who has had it.</p>
<p>This is not to keep us safe.  This is definitely about something else, and I'm astounded more people can't see that.</p>

        <p>Well I hope you realize that not all people respond to the same situation. The media alone doesn‚Äôt make all the decisions and how you act.</p>
<p>Anyway 6 feet is the average distance a germ can fly out of your mouth. That is an average. That is partly why masks are required. The other thing is is that some people don‚Äôt follow the rules. And that is also why the US has a crap load of cases and deaths.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs actually typing. If you want to ridicule me, do it correctly.</p>

        <p>Ever heard of the flow analogy? You probably haven‚Äôt but I‚Äôll explain it.</p>
<p>Think of all the deaths as a bottomless bucket. Every death is a tiny drop in that bucket. Those drops are in a constant flow. People die all the time.</p>
<p>All medical professionals are trying to do is to help stop the flow. They are trying to help people not die.</p>
<p>I know that the way the government is handling this is a bit stupid but all they are trying to do is to slow the flow. And I think it‚Äôs pretty stupid how you think it‚Äôs BS that they are doing that. Are you annoyed that the government is trying to save lives? Are you uncomfortable staying locked down while the government is taking in tens of thousands of people a day in places like New York?</p>

        <p>Well that may be true depending on what state you live in. Utah? Yeah that is likely. Other Midwest and Mideast states? Not that likely.</p>
<p>I live in Utah county. The suicide rate in Utah is about 22 per 100,000</p>
<p>The death rate for covid in Utah county is 57 per 100,000</p>
<p>But let me add this... the suicide rate was from last year. These were not suicides from this year. I couldn‚Äôt find any info on how many people committed suicide because of the lockdown so I assume that it wasn‚Äôt a big enough number to fuss over about that would make any headlines. I seriously doubt that there would be more suicides because of the lockdown than the covid deaths in your county.</p>

        <p>But how many?! You never gave me any info about the suicide rate for the last six months in your county.</p>
<p>Utah had the fifth highest suicide rate in America and I live in Utah. It‚Äôs about 7 people per 100,000 away from Montana (highest suicide rate). The death count in my county is higher per 100,000 than the suicide rate. You haven‚Äôt given info about the suicides or how many there might have been because of the lockdown but I do not know a single person, nor does my parents, siblings, cousins, etc know about a person who committed suicide because of the lockdown.</p>
<p>Just because you know someone doesn‚Äôt make the number of suicides you know somehow jack up. So what if you know someone who killed themselves? Does that matter? Does that somehow make the suicide rate increase? No! It may seem that way but it‚Äôs not.</p>
<p>I know someone who died of covid yet I‚Äôm not saying that covid has a lot of deaths based off of speculation about said death! I pulled up the numbers instead of assuming. You haven‚Äôt yet.</p>

        <p>Ah yes, the only tactic to defend yourself as I irrefutably crush your assumption.</p>
<p>Anyway you didn‚Äôt have to respond at all, nor did you have to go into the mind set thinking that I am somehow selling this to you.</p>
<p>I am not selling this to you. You are only perceiving me as selling this.</p>
<p>All I was trying to do is to make you understand the pandemic a bit more. Label it all you want, it‚Äôs free, you don‚Äôt have to accept what I say (I don‚Äôt know you so I wouldn‚Äôt care), and I wouldn‚Äôt care that you are assuming that  I‚Äôm trying to somehow make you buy this.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry. I hope you got the cash back for your trip and you can make it happen.</p>
<p>From my understanding parts of the USA are crazy with this lockdown stuff. Traveling really opened my eyes as to how cultural these restrictions seem to be. For example I was at a wedding in Norway and someone mentioned covid, but all they did was to advise people wash their hands more. No mask, no weird rules.</p>
<p>And you don't have to accept this new normal. Take care of yourself, and focus on what you're going to do when you get out. Never let the bastards grind you down.</p>

        <p>I'm glad you got to go on your trip by the way and had a brilliant time.</p>
<p>I did get my money back, thankfully. I was so looking forward to seeing my family. I really, really hope we will be allowed - goodness can you believe we speak like this now? - to live our lives and travel next year.</p>
<p>I moved to a less restrictive state, but I am from California. My parents are there - it is a disaster. They are unbelievably miserable. You can't go anywhere. They only just opened playgrounds for children, but you can only be there for 30 minutes and your child cannot be around other children. Isn't that insane? That is how it is in many places in the USA.</p>

        <p>Well the medical professionals are trying to cure this disease, like most. Diseases are different. They sometimes are harder to cure.</p>
<p>Take the Spanish flu for example. It lasted two years and was way worse than COVID-19. This pandemic has so far lasted 6-7 months. We should either be out of this soon from either the vaccine on its way (I trust the doctors that are making the vaccine) or us building an immunity to this disease.</p>

        <p>The way the world has completely gone off its rocker in the last six months reminds me of a line from a movie I once saw (I believe it was spoken in real life, but paraphrased somewhat). It certainly sums up my present viewpoint...</p>
<p><em>Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, speaking to another German officer, after having just left the Fuehrerbunker:</em></p>
<p>"And as I looked around that room, and realized I was the only sane man in it, I stopped and wondered 'How must I look to them?'"</p>

        <p>Shout back at him. Everyone needs to stand up to these people. What's he going to do? Arrest you? No one will care. More people need to stand up and shame these people so they feel like outcasts. I've done this several times. I am probably quite unusual I have a very thick skin, but each time they've backed down or apologised. You have to stand up for yourself.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree with you, but at the same time, the owner of a store can dictate the rules for it. Same with any property. If I tell my guests they have to wear a silly hat to enter my house, they don't have to wear the hat, but they aren't entering my house. My house, my rules.</p>

        <p>Well technically the stores aren‚Äôt government property, so that means that the store owner can require masks to enter the store and there is nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>Just wondering aswell, can you not put on a mask for 15 minutes? I put mine on for 8 hours a day + extra activities and events, yet I don‚Äôt complain.</p>

        <p>Surely there are more of us but they‚Äôre just afraid to say anything or go against the hive mind right? I admit I was playing along until literally today. Never thought of this as anything other than an experiment in social control but figured it would go away. Today I realized its not going away and it‚Äôs turning everyone into a jerk and I quit playing along. Went shopping without a mask in a city and a store both with mask mandates and nothing happened and it felt amazing. Never wearing one of those stupid things again. I‚Äôm done with the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù. There have to be more likeminded people who just need a little longer before they snap. Just hope it‚Äôs not too long.</p>

        <p>I feel completely alone. I know I'm not crazy. I'm 100% sure of it but it's getting difficult living with the reality of how easily manipulated my peers are into giving away all of our human rights and democracy because they believe the fear that the media instills in them. </p>
<p>I shared this article in a group of leftie mates who before all this pretended to care deeply about democracy, human rights, and the direction humanity is headed in. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/29/coronavirus-act-liberties-powers-police-public-health-crisis">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/29/coronavirus-act-liberties-powers-police-public-health-crisis</a></p>
<p>I posted it and said "maybe this is something you boys can get behind?".</p>
<p>Crickets for two days then they just come back with "nah". That's all they had to say. No conversation, no consideration, just "nah". I guess they didn't really care about those things to start with then. I guess they just went along with what they were told to do and none of it was ever meaningful.</p>
<p>My brother keeps asking me why I am so surprised. Did I not already realise that everyone was a braindead sheep who wouldn't know authoritarianism if it slapped them in the face. I guess I didn't. I guess I had hope that if things got really bad, people would wake up. </p>
<p>I honestly can't believe what people around me are saying. Police can detain whomever they want without suspicion of anything apart from being infectious (which could be anyone) and government can pass whatever laws they want without a democratic vote and lefties are completely OK with this even 6 months in?</p>
<p>I'm completely losing it. I can't go back to how I was with these people. I didn't realise everyone was so braindead. I don't want to know anyone who thinks this is OK. You know that if we ever get out the other side of this people will pretend that they weren't frothing at the mouth begging for more authoritarianism but I will know the truth an I can't look at them the same. Help.</p>

        <p>I can relate to what you're saying - I'm still having trouble getting used to living in a society which is very different from the one I thought I was living in - back in early March, seeing lockdowns in Italy and Spain, I had thoughts like "British people would never put up with that!" - but here we are, with people calling for even stricter rules - and I've noticed it's the 25 to 40 year old left wingers who are most fiercely in favour of a strict lockdown.</p>
<p>My way of coping with this global insanity is to deliberately seek out people who are speaking out against it - on the radio, on the internet, and in person - I keep saying to my husband that I'm so glad we are in agreement over this, we can support each other in an insane world.</p>

        <p>The only good thing is that the UK has a history of loving freedom in comparison to Europe. We don't have a military history and have community by policing. All of this BS is largely impossible to enforce unless they go full martial law which is too obvious and won't happen. I think this could be a source of comfort for you - no one can really enforce any of this.</p>

        <p>Totally agree. It is a huge wake up call for all of us. You're not alone. Don't be scared to state what you believe in and cut off those who criticise you for your opinions. They were never really your friends just in good times. Think of it this way: this is not abnormal in totalitarian regimes. Time after time friends, neighbours, family would shop in their friends for political favours, social approval, or just due to stupidity. It's like that moment in The Pianist when Adrian Brody is hiding in a building and a woman sees him and starts manically shouting "Jew, Jew". It's scary because it shows how easily (not very bright) people can be programmed to just hate reactively like Pavlov's dog theory! Until now, we've had the luxury in the West to never be exposed to these harsh realities. But now we are and it will shape everyone because even though it's not like Nazi Germany, it shows how quickly people will turn against you for social points.</p>

        <p>Agree. It‚Äôs nice to see sanity and reasonable discussion.  I was waiting outside a restaurant for a takeout order near the table where orders were set down.  I stood a few feet away from the table wearing a mask and the worker opened the door and started yelling ‚Äúget six feet back! NOW!‚Äù while frantically waving her hands at me.     Lol.  I wanted to explain that I was just waiting for her to set the food down.  On the table.  And only then would I take it and leave.  But she seemed to think I was going to lunge at her or something.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile the restaurant right next door was open and filled with happy customers seated and eating and drinking.   It‚Äôs all so bewildering.   And ridiculous.</p>

        <p>I walked in the local ABC store without a mask. The young man at the register yelled me to wear a mask.  He knows me well since we have this altercation every time I enter.  When I refuse, he calls his manager.  His manager brings me a mask.  I hang it on one ear and continue to shop.  At the register, the young man refuses to let me pay.  I remind him that the Pandemic is over and he stares at me defiantly.  I tell him he can check me out and I can move on quickly or I can stand here all day long.  The manager comes over and checks me out.  I give him back the mask he gave me.  </p>
<p>These confrontations used to bother me.  Now, I am used to them.  It's become a bit of a game. I've not lost yet.  They always end up looking stupid.  </p>
<p>If you hate wearing mask, take it off, join us in the fight, stand your ground. We are a small group and we need support.  It gets harder every day that we comply.  People are getting used to the muzzles.  It's becoming part of our normal every day life.  Please fight with us.  We need you.  If we loose, you'll have regrets.   </p>
<p>"You must speak because silence and compliance aides and abets tyranny."</p>
<p>This is just the beginning.  We will win.  I need your support.</p>
