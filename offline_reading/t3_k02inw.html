    <strong>What city in Florida should I relocate to? (or, Arizona? South Carolina?)</strong>
    <p><p>I am thinking of going to Florida, at least for a month, to be somewhere without masks and curfews, where things are open...  </p>
<p>...but...I'm a liberal, city-dwelling type. I know, most of us are insane these days. No, I don't understand it either.  </p>
<p>But I do like art museums, and coffee houses, and bars, and bookstores, libraries, and natural environments. I want to be around people. I want to be in public.  </p>
<p>I understand that Ron DeSantis has prohibited municipalities from collecting fines on people for not wearing masks, but apparently municipalities like Fort Lauderdale can and do shut down businesses for allowing people in without masks.  </p>
<p>Are there any cities that aren't horrible in Florida? That don't have enforced mask mandates? That have the kinds of things I like?  </p>
<p>Or Arizona?  </p>
<p>Or South Carolina?  </p>
<p>I feel like the mask mandates contribute very substantially to the depression, alienation and isolation I've experienced over the last eight months. I really just want to be somewhere I don't feel awful, where I can meet new people.</p></p>

        <p>I’m in Bradenton fl and it’s chilling. Went to the dmv the other day with no mask and nobody said anything. They had a few employees with no mask too.</p>

        <p>I guess it'd depend on how big of a city you want, and how important it is for the city to be liberal.</p>
<p>So I hate all the mask BS going on, and I'm quite conservative, but love the city life. I wanted to move somewhere that reflects that, and in the process of all my research, I've definitely taken note of liberal cities that don't have mask mandates. But it's kind of difficult, because (generally speaking) the more liberal states/cities are the ones that are really pushing lockdowns and mask mandates. And the bigger the city, the more likely it is to have tons of restrictions.</p>

        <p>I don't care if the city is liberal, and it doesn't need to be a big city... I just want to find a city that's normal. It would be nice to find a city that has things that I like in it.</p>

        <p>South Dakota's probably your best bet then, as long as you can handle the cold. Gov. Noem is quite insistent that they won't lockdown or issue any mask mandates.</p>
<p>DeSantis in Florida is good, but I'd be wary since the mayors of many (<em>many</em>) cities in Florida are still requiring masks. Even if you aren't going to be fined for not wearing one, your job will presumably likely still require it, alongside many other businesses you'd want to enter.</p>
<p>I used to live out in Phoenix for a while and it's an awesome city. Loved my time there, and hope to move back sometime soon. But right now, Phoenix and it's suburbs aren't the best place as far as lockdowns and mask mandates go. Same goes for the rest of the state.</p>
<p>South Carolina is normal-ish, but there's still a ton of local mask mandates in place.</p>
<p>Generally, I've found that pretty much every city over 75k residents has a mask mandate in place, outside of South Dakota.</p>
<p>So overall, I'd recommend Sioux Falls, SD. Very normal state, and a city with nearly 200k residents so you'd have enough to do. Rspid City, SD (80k) as runner-up. South Dakota is really the only place in the US where I can be certain that things are normal and will stay normal, whereas in other states, even if things are normal now, it's far from a guarantee that they'll stay even halfway normal. I'm actually personally planning on moving there sometime soon.</p>

        <p>FUCK, aghh, what the hell?! I had no idea, last I saw was the one where the mayor voted to deny it. Should have known the people pushing for it would  try over and over again until they got a result they wanted.</p>
<p>Well that sucks hard. It's a plus that it won't really be enforced, but I'm sure most business will now require employees and customers to comply.</p>
<p>Rapid City is up next, I'm guessing. Especially judging by the meetings they're having.</p>
