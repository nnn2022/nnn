    <strong>Sources and information mainstream media wont share</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sure many of you here have been accused of getting all your information off of Facebook and you need to "do real research" so I've compiled some compelling sources that I have only found or heard about through the grapevine and for some reason get buried by other search results. these sources mainly focus on the state of Canada/US, and the UK. I'm not telling anyone what to do with this information or these sources, I just want people to be aware of what isn't highlighted in the media and if anyone else has any impartial or useful documents/sources feel free to share them below.</p>

<h1>Reiner Fullmich</h1>
<p>this man is a practicing consumer protection trial lawyer and has been so for over 26 years in Germany and California. He is planning to put together the largest class action law suit in history to sue the WHO and all involved in furthering the "Corona Scandal" for "crimes against humanity" A.k.a "Nuremberg 2.0" another detail that stuck out to me in the transcript is a German "panic paper" he speaks about which was calling for children to be made to feel responsible, and I quote, "for the painful, tortured death of their parents and grandparents if they do not follow the corona rules” he further explains everything in the sources below including the inaccuracy of PCR testing, I recommend to check them out</p>

<h1>Michael Yeadon</h1>
<p>Many probably already have heard, but He was vice president and chief scientific officer for Pfizer’s United Kingdom-based allergy and respiratory unit until 2011. There are many articles attacking his character, intelligence, and sanity, and some articles like <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pfizer-chief-scientist-vaccines/">Snopes</a> is quoted for saying </p>
<p>" despite a scientific rationale for those claims that has since been proven to be unambiguously incorrect. "</p>
<p>I think its important to recognize if someone with his experience and in his position is speaking up it deserves to be heard and his main argument I still largely agree with </p>
<p>" You also don’t set about planning to vaccinate millions of fit and healthy people with a vaccine that hasn’t been extensively tested on human subjects" and also</p>

<h1>Halifax Nurse Speaks out (Touches on many topics relating to Covid)</h1>
<p>this is a recent one I've seen and it is very formal and well done in my opinion. It has largely only been shared on twitter and no other searches could bring this video up for me but she talks about the many lies being spread about Covid and everything she says is verifiable with sources if you want to further look into what she says. </p>

<h1>Leaked email from the Liberal Party of Canada</h1>
<p>it is unknown if this email was legitimately from officials inside of Canadas government but none the less it has been very accurate in predicting the next move of the PM and his goons. </p>
<p><a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/leaked-document-canada"><strong>Email leak from October still proving to be accurate</strong></a></p>
<p>the next prediction to come true is probably going to be the full travel restrictions and we are already beginning to see that here. its not too long of a read so I'll just highlight two parts from the email</p>
<p>"roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals. They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes."</p>
<p>“Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area”  </p>
<p>my guess is military deployment will probably ramp up after the travel restriction are fully in place. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Its only a matter of time until Vaccine passports are implemented in Canada</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2021/05/01/canada-will-require-a-vaccine-passport-for-entry/?sh=f4c99e41a71a"><strong>Source</strong></a></p>
<p>not only is Trudeau in favor of vaccine passports, a great majority of Canadians are as well .  "Nearly eight in 10 Canadians (78%) agree (including 56% who strongly agree) that all travelers entering Canada should be required to have a vaccine passport, according to a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/majority-support-canada-vaccine-passports-international-travel-large-events"><strong>new Ipsos survey</strong></a><strong>.</strong> </p>
<p>with this much support from the public, Trudeau will have a field day implementing this. and after the very popular idea of vaccine passports are implemented, the less popular idea of requiring a vaccination for everyday life. </p>
<p>"The path forward is less clear when it comes to the role of vaccine passports in more everyday aspects of people’s lives. Canadians are split down the middle on whether <strong>shops, restaurants, and offices should require a vaccine passport</strong>: just under half (47%) agree (22% strongly/25% somewhat), while nearly as many 45% disagree (18% strongly/27% somewhat), and 8% not sure. "</p>
<p>" If a vaccine certificate or passport is introduced, nearly two in ten Canadians (17%) think it should be required indefinitely for activities and travel "</p>
<p>"These are findings from two surveys of adults under the age of 75 conducted by Ipsos on its Global Advisor online platform: A 28-country survey based on 21,021 interviews held between March 26 and April 9, 2021, and a 12-country survey based on 15,529 interviews held April 8-11, 2021. "</p>

<h1>Another point of interest is a recent video coming from Nova Scotia Premier and his Chief medical officer</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb5lpTUNR-g&amp;t=465s"><strong>Video</strong></a></p>
<p>The Premiere of Nova Scotia and his Chief medical officer are live talking about Covid cases, </p>
<p>This is a direct quote from the chief medical officer of Nova Scotia, his name is Dr. Robert Strang. <strong>“at the pop-up sites we are using the rapid tests which aren’t as accurate [As a PCR test]</strong> (which are also largely inaccurate) <strong>but they are good for the people who have no symptoms whatsoever”</strong></p>
<p>Another direct quote from the Chief medical officer <strong>“were close to having the ability to test up to 15,000 Nova Scotians a day”</strong> … <strong>“to put that into context at the beginning of the pandemic we could do 200 tests a day”</strong></p>
<p>we are effectively still in lockdown with panic just as bad as last year. all over about 60 reported daily cases of Covid here (a number not seen since last year according to the premiere and Dr Strang) my strife with this logic is...</p>
<p>Is it not possible that by increasing the number of tests by a multitude of 75X that could harvest false positives from these not so accurate testing methods which Dr Strang is on air with the premiere admitting that these test can be inaccurate.</p>
<h1>Covid Marshals may be coming to the UK until 2023 despite plans to end restrictions in June 2021.</h1>
<p>“One in nine councils contacted by the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/27/army-covid-marshals-recruited-roles-could-last-2023/amp/"><strong>Telegraph</strong></a> confirmed they planned to employ marshals past June 21.</p>
<p>Hertfordshire County Council is one of the councils advertising and is reportedly offering firms a contract of up to £3million to provide 60 marshals from July 1 until January 31 next year - with a possible one year extension, taking us to 2023.” the 60 marshals outlined here doesn't seem very significant but if these rules are going to go past June you can bet they will up the amount of marshals too. not to mention the complete unnecessity to employ "Covid marshals" </p>

<h1>False India Narrative pushed by the media</h1>
<p>Besides India being an impoverished country where millions already die every year due to famine and disease and where open cremations have been common place there for years. Sadly many would like to use this country as an example on why to stay fearful. India has many problems and has had these problems for decades and its disingenuous to try and add covid to that list.</p>
<p>if you look at the Covid infection graph for India <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data">Here</a> </p>
<p>Then look at Graph of cumulative doses administered across the country,   </p>
<p>You will notice the spikes in cases are identical to when vaccines were being shipped by the masses to them while the total death count remains low in comparison, suggesting the mass vaccinations and testing (potential false positives etc) combined with the living conditions in India is doing massive harm and you can find multiple videos of Indians who are aware of what is happening around them telling the media to stop shipping vaccines, and even fighting people supporting the vaccinations. but since their is over <strong>1.3 Billion</strong> people living in India  the media will use whatever flattering number they can to support their narrative when in reality In 2020/2021 13.5Million died to all causes whereas as of now its reported \~200K have died to Covid. but lets remember many factors are often lumped into the Coivd death tally such as multiple underlying health issues etc. and media has in some cases completely fabricate the severity of Covid in India. like when they pushed the fake Covid stories which were actually a gas leak in Vizag from last year </p>

        <p>Thank you for your work, friend. Seeing all of this just makes me tired. Being locked away for a year now makes me tired. Not being able to do anything about it makes me tired. Seeing all this proof and still having people calling me a lunatic when I just want to debate, wishing death upon me and telling me I have to stay locked away for the rest of my life makes me tired.</p>
