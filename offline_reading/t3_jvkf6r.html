    <strong>The left is pro-choice when it comes to abortion but aren't pro-choice when it comes to vaccinations.</strong>
    <p><p>Another prime example of the left picking and choosing narratives that best suit their personal agenda. (Or the agenda that will gather the most reactions on the internet.)</p></p>

        <p>The pro-choice pussy hatters use similar logic when it comes to masks. I can't remember the exact horseshit reasoning they managed to come up with but, I do know they were able to drum up some kind of explanation for why nobody is allowed to tell them whether they can kill a baby or not but, every single human person is allowed to demand that I wear a piece of fabric over my mouth all day long. </p>
<p>I think it was something like, their well thought out decision to fuck the first Starbucks barista, that pronounced their name correctly that day, and then vacuum out any mistakes that were made, only hurts their vagina and it doesn't kill anyone, while my selfish desire, to breathe fresh air and share my smile with others, will eventually kill everyone I walk past and their geriatric relatives. Maybe not the exact wording but, pretty damn close.</p>

        <p>And I respect that. I may not agree with it but, I respect your right to make decisions and choices as you see fit. As long as whatever it is, is mostly legal and doesn't cause me or my family physical harm, pro choice to your hearts content.</p>
<p>I think that's been the big problem. I remember the days when it was okay to disagree with each other. Having a bunch of different people, that felt differently about things and didn't want to kill each other because of it, was great. As long as people aren't rude and overbearing, I am fine if we don't see every single thing the same way. That's boring. That's what's happening now. A bunch of people spout the same bullshit over and over. They pretend to believe in all the same shit. And, anyone who doesn't see it all they way they do, is a racist, sexist, ist, ist, ist. People are being turned into robots. I
Respectfully disagreeing made for good conversation. My best friends were the people I disagreed with the most back in the day. When everyone started to beat their beliefs into one another and, if after that beating, the other person didn't believe in what they did, all hell would break loose, things started to go down hill. That's when everything changed. It feels like it happened overnight. One day I woke up and I was like, I don't fucking like these people anymore. I had nothing in common with most of the people I spent time with, out of nowhere.</p>
<p>I'm not sure we will ever get back to the way it used to be. The digital age has made people so anti other people. The young people have no idea how to interact face to face. The mask bullshit will only make it worse. Its sad. I used to love talking to people. I used to enjoy discussing shit with people. Now, I just don't like most people. Most people probably dont like me. I'm kind of an asshole. I don't trust most people. I don't like big groups or being in crowded places. I am content with being with my wife and kids or by myself. I dont have anyone I would call a friend. I have neighbors I talk to sometimes but, that's it. It wasn't always like this. It is now. Its been like this for a long time. Its crazy.</p>

        <p>When people say that they usually aren't agreeing with the need to wear a mask, they are just saying it's a free choice.  If someone wants to wear a mask, good for them, I don't think it should be banned.  But I'm not wearing one, whether it's voluntary or mandatory, and I certainly don't think it should be mandatory and enforced via fines.  That's all people mean, not 'I would wear a mask but because it's mandatory now I won't', there's very, very few people who say that and that would indeed be a pretty stupid position to take if you actually believe masks are beneficial you are doing yourself harm.</p>

        <p>I'm saying these people were protesting the mask wearing even before there was a mandate or bill passed enforcing them in indoor public spaces, but then not giving any reason why they wouldn't wear one besides being against the -at this point- hypothetical mandate enforcing them. Which is why I'm saying they used that as an excuse to hide the fact that they just simply didn't want to wear one. Add this to the fact that their reasoning for not wanting to wear one conveniently changed throughout the year from it a) being against "forced" wearing, to (b) "it's not proven to work" to (c) "They do more harm than good" , then when these are shown to be incorrect they go back to (a) which by that point discussions were finally in place to pass a bill enforcing people to wear them in shops etc because of the lack of people wearing them when they were simply asked and advised to.  And when all other excuses are not accepted these people then just claim to be disabled, as people with certain intellectual disabilities or health conditions are exempt from wearing them, which then begs the question "Why are you out in a densely packed public place during a respiratory disease pandemic if you have a health condition that makes you susceptible?" . It's frustrating because these people are also quite often against lockdown but in favour of lockdowns for just susceptible/vulnerable people, which they have inadvertently them categorised themselves among, which just shows it's a bullshit ideal with no consistency or sense.</p>
<p>Can you tell me why you think these face masks aren't beneficial?  And how am I doing myself harm by wearing one in public to prevent spreading any possible illness I might have?</p>

        <p>Not a strawman, and not disregarded. Those three things are also victimless crimes, and shouldn't be crimes unto themselves. Drunk driving and speeding MAY lead to a crime (e.g. negligent vehicular homicide), and those crimes should be prosecuted.</p>

        <p>Any medical procedure should be 100% your choice.  And I don’t mean “yeah you don’t have to take it.... unless you wanna travel and be in public”.  That is government coercion and dangerously close to a dystopian novel.  It blows my mind that some people are okay giving up the right to choose what goes directly into their bloodstream.</p>

        <p>What you are asking about is one of the more "complicated" concepts in libertarian thought.  Who (and what) is capable of consent?  There is no fine line (and is the source of all the "muh libright pedophile jokes" heh) so you end up with shades of gray.</p>
<p>Sometimes that is the answer though.  There is not absolute heuristic so you go case by case.</p>

        <p>I disagree. Mandated medical procedures are wrong.  Might be different if there wasn’t trillions of dollars at stake.  Vaccines are a massive business.  Injured victims or rarely ever compensated and a very small amount of people are even aware of the risks.</p>

<p>It is short for COMMUNIST.  It is a "derogatory slur" if you will.  I do so enjoy my slurs (a guilty pleasure I admit, forgive me my rare vices).  Really let's you get to the "heart" of an "issue" ;)</p>

Also saying what's the point of life as a rebuttal is really stupid lol, I could say that about anything. The point was that legislation and enforcement on vaccines it to increase living conditions so why would you remove that for something that would make living conditions worse.

<p>Don't worry silly goose.  I am sure if we go to war with Iran we can send you in as a meat shield.  I know you miss war ever since Obama left office.  He did start a number of tremendous wars didnt he?  Really threw a life line to the old military industrial complex didnt he?</p>
<p>Do you work for them?  The military industrial complex?  Only reason I can think of for why you are so desperate for war...</p>
<p>Word of advice?  Don't pray for war.  Pray for peace.</p>

<p>Pick one. Now put your thinking cap on (be sure to remove the tin foil one first), and consider the implications of bombing nuclear sites because you're afraid the incoming administration will likely reengage the Iran deal to avoid conflict....</p>

        <p>You know what, you're right. You've made zero claims of anything, just sputtered nonsense. I was just curious what site I could check for an article about Trump and Iran that you might approve of.</p>
<p>I'm sure you'll have a problem with this source as well, but the courts (including the USSC) tend to disagree with your "but muh bill of rights!" argument.</p>
<p>https://www.acslaw.org/expertforum/face-covering-requirements-and-the-constitution/</p>
<p>Our Constitution principally entrusts “[t]he safety and the health of the people” to the politically accountable officials of the States “to guard and protect.” Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11, 38 (1905). When those officials “undertake to act in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties,” their latitude “must be especially broad.” Marshall v. United States, 414 U. S. 417, 427 (1974). Where those broad limits are not exceeded, they should not be subject to second-guessing by an “unelected federal judiciary,” which lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health and is not accountable to the people.</p>

        <p>See I support guns and abortions.
I was highlighting that some would argue for one and against the other(typically gun crowd anti abortion, typically abortion crowd anti gun), I support both. 
I love freedom.
I wouldn’t say Covid is good, or that dead people is good. I also have no delusional fantasies or insecurities about mortality. 
We will die, maybe decades from now, maybe moments. Hopefully peacefully and calmly, but for many, probably most of us, it won’t be. It will be painful, frightening and lonely, just as life is. </p>

        <p>It’s highly contagious, probably everyone will get it in some form. Lockdown and masks help stagger infections of those most vulnerable so the hospitals aren’t overwhelmed like they were at the beginning when there wasn’t any information. Unfortunately, though, some hospitals are feeling it now. Lockdown sucks for sure, no denying that.</p>

<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>&rt;Unfortunately, though, some hospitals are feeling it now.</p>
<p>Wow that sucks.  Can you show me?  What do you mean by "feeling it"?  Kinda like how it feels to come across a dead addict with a needle in their arm under a bridge?  He just wanted to go to a meeting you see.  But they aren't allowed because of Lockdown.</p>
<p>&rt;no denying that.</p>
<p>I so wish you believed that.  I wish I could get you all to listen.  The pain and suffering you are causing with your naivety is nothing short of heart breaking.</p>
<p>Please.  I am tired.</p>

        <p>I live in nyc. I saw how fast it spread and how staying home and wearing masks flattened the curve. At least now there is testing and general information. In NYC now everything is pretty cool. </p>
<p>I’m sorry for your pain. There’s been situations in my life where I’ve felt the same. Pandemics happen. Idk. I’ve traveled the world extensively, from what I’ve seen, I’m surprised it took this long. For example, in west Africa, Guinea-Bissau .....where eating monkeys is forbidden because of Ebola, I was still offered monkey in a small village. Yet, in urban areas, there’s still hand washing stations before you enter restaurants. </p>
<p>If it helps, I used lockdown to do a lot of things I couldn’t do before. I even picked up another job. I live alone and I’m lonely and grateful for my dog. We don’t have control of everything. But it will end. It just doesn’t seem that way right now.</p>

<p>I weep for you.  Truly.</p>
<p>&rt;It pandemics happen.</p>
<p>Of course they do.  This is... well... not what you have been led to think it is.  I know that is a scary prospect.  That so many trusted sources have started lying to you.  But it is true unfortunately.</p>
<p>&rt;If it helps, I used lockdown to do a lot of things I couldn’t do before.</p>
<p>As did I.  Used to travel so much for work it was all I did (well I had my "volunteering" of course).</p>
<p>Now with my free time I am doing actual volunteering not just the... more painful kind I have been doing for years :/</p>
<p>Please wake up.  I need your help.</p>

        <p>I’m awake. I got about 5 clients now. Can’t afford not to be. Lol. It’s all good here. But it wasn’t at the beginning. I had to change my outlook. </p>
<p>I have my own trusted experience of 25 years traveling the world and studying culture and societies. You know there’s tons of remote work now that you could do just to take up some time. I’m spending the winter in Mexico. I just didn’t let any of this effect my life, instead kept moving forward. I encourage you to turn your pain into helping yourself instead of waiting for someone to fix it or trying to change other people’s minds. You have to look out for #1. Fuck them all. Get another job. Drop the money in retirement funds and keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Edit: learn how to beat the system. Take advantage of things while you can. Surely you know the phrase of keeping your enemies closer. Same concept.</p>

        <p>Are you purposely ignoring the millions of lives lockdowns take?  Drug and alcohol abuse, child and spousal abuse, suicides, homelessness, bankruptcy, cancer other treatable conditions that went untreated because hospitals everywhere were only allowed to treat covid patients even when empty....</p>
<p>Do their deaths not count?  And you want to go back to that?  Is that what you want?  You want more people to die from non-covid related issues just to save a few that might be covid-related?</p>
<p>The UK recently published an article that estimated more deaths from lock downs than they had from covid.  Do you have any compassion for these people?  Because I'm having a really difficult time caring about covid deaths.</p>

        <p>The world is a tough place sometimes and we are all entitled to care about the things we want. We never had empty hospitals refusing care. That’s against the law. So, you may want to take that to the govt level. </p>
<p>And keep in mind that America has some of the worst medical and social practices in the world for a developed nation. This didn’t start with covid.</p>

This same reasoning applied to the peak of all this and as a result, hospitals everywhere in Michigan were empty including the one where I work.  On average, until the hospital opened back up, we had a grand total of 4 patients in the entire hospital on any given day.   We were only allowed to take in patients who were dying or had covid.  We were not allowed to take in patients who had treatable conditions that were not fatal.  Google it- it's all there.  Covid changed everything and it allowed a lot of law breaking "iN tHe NaMe Of HeAlTh."</p>

        <p>Ok no offense. The daily mail is a tabloid. It’s like reading the NY Post. And I work in media. And for a tabloid, lol! In general where I live, that’s how hospitals work. Dying or people in big trouble are admitted to a hospital. Treatable conditions to a primary care doctor, or wait for hours. That has always been protocol. Yeah, but if people died as a result, that’s a class action lawsuit.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of articles.  I'm not paid to find the right one that's tailored to you so I'm not going to try.  I do know that Michigan suspended all "elective procedures" and it made all sorts of news.  It caused a lot of deaths.  I work in a hospital and I know that since I've worked here, it was the very first and only time this hospital had empty hallways and whole departments completely shut down.  People were laid off.  Nurses were taking temps at the door just to keep some of their hours.   That happened.  And there are news articles about how that did cause deaths.</p>
<p>Just like how a lot of Democratic state governors signed executive orders forcing nursing homes to take in and keep covid patients instead of sending them to the hospital. That caused a whole lot of deaths as well.   Covid didn't kill all that many people- it was the way we handled Covid that killed a whole lot of people.   To my knowledge, not one state governor has ever been held accountable.  They've all been protected.</p>

        <p>Yes, I have watched several people die of heroin in person along with over 10% of my graduating class now being dead from it so I have very strong first hand knowledge on that. It’s lack of mental health services in this country. We have a generation that didn’t choose to be born, was pressured into things by their family with no means of their own opinion, when they can’t achieve the dreams they were told their whole life would be handed to them, they look for a way to escape and that’s drugs. The failure is education and the lack of a mental health system in this country, if we had both there would be no issues. The best thing you can do for this already overpopulated planet is to simply not have kids.</p>

Sure, we can all work towards fixing education and mental health but there is such a pride in lack of education in this country that it’s painful. You and me as individuals don’t matter one bit yet we scream for individualism. A lone animal won’t survive but a pack will, they live for the greater good of those around them.

        <p>Thank you for having a civil conversation. It seems like we both want the same thing although with different approaches. The most I can do is bring awareness to those around me about the struggles. I can’t fix someone’s living situation or mental health but I can provide advice. I was lost for many many years, luckily because of my education and willingness to learn and engage in conversation I excelled quickly and held down a $50k a year job while going to college, I know this isn’t the option for many due to that lack of education. It was sad when I went to a college in the south and found out many of my peers left high school with the same education I had in 10th grade from a different states public education. It’s not fair, they are being pushed into a losing battle (mostly by parents). College simply shows you how to learn which is a skill many don’t possess on their own. I’m more concerned about how many generations will be able to come after ours, I love life and want others to be able to as well, but the path of destruction we are on will not give future generations that ability. There is no “me” in my mind, we are all a collective species that should be working towards the greater good for all even if it’s at the inconvenience of some. Lives are more important than the economy, education is more important than religion, and we are all more important than any one of us individually. As long as we are fighting together to bring every last person up to a higher level, we have done what we can. If everyone was educated enough, we would never need government intervention but sadly we aren’t there.</p>

        <p>Thanks for taking the time for the back and forth. And I apologize for my gigantic run on paragraph. </p>
<p>By economy, I mean anything involving money. Lives are more important than money. I don’t care if the entire economy collapses, stock markets crash whatever the fear is, consumerism needs to end anyways. 
Also, not sure why you think I’m female, I’m a mid 30s male. 
I agree with all of your points but the education = religion part. I see them as completely contradictory. If someone is educated enough you would not believe in something that has no evidence.
I’ve spent a good portion of my life looking for a single iota of evidence and there is absolutely 0, but that is not to discount why people have it, I would never want to strip someone of the only piece that gives them meaning in life but it also makes them care a little less about this life because there is someone to “fix” everything and they don’t need any self responsibility. </p>
<p>Also I’m all for gay space communism!</p>
<p>Thanks again for healthy conversation and I mean no offense if you identify as religious!</p>

        <p>&rt;Thanks for taking the time for the back and forth.</p>
<p>It was my pleasure as always.</p>
<p>&rt;I apologize for my gigantic run on paragraph.</p>
<p>No need. but thank you.</p>
<p>&rt;money</p>
<p>Would you mind defining this for me?  Again.  Different people mean different things when they say "money" I have found.</p>
<p>&rt; I don’t care if the entire economy collapses</p>
<p>Why not?  Have you not studied what happens when an economy collapses?  It is hellish!</p>
<p>&rt;consumerism needs to end anyways.</p>
<p>That's like... your opinion man.  Define consumerism if you don't mind.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, not sure why you think I’m female</p>
<p>Me either!  Must have been your tone of voice ;)  </p>
<p>I make bad assumptions sometimes.  Get out over my skis if you will.  I apologize good sir!  I meant no offense.  Believe me! ;)</p>
<p>&rt;I’m a mid 30s male</p>
<p>Me too believe it or not (well early 30s but early are still mid right? hehe)</p>
<p>&rt;I agree with all of your points but the education = religion part. I see them as completely contradictory. </p>
<p>I know.  I used to be the same.</p>
<p>&rt; If someone is educated enough you would not believe in something that has no evidence. </p>
<p>Well I trust my own two eyes unfortunately ;)</p>
<p>&rt; I’ve spent a good portion of my life looking for a single iota of evidence and there is absolutely 0</p>
<p>I believe you sazed.</p>
<p>&rt;that is not to discount why people have it, I would never want to strip someone of the only piece</p>
<p>Once you get on my level (hehehe not to toot my own horn but <em>beep beep</em> heeheheh) you will understand that it is silly to use the word "only" in this context.</p>
<p>&rt;Also I’m all for gay space communism!</p>
<p>Yay!  Holodecks for some!  Klingon pain sticks for others!</p>
<p>We just disagree on how to get there.  and that is ok... for now ;)</p>

        <p>But only because I like your user name ok!?  This isn't charity.</p>
<p>&rt;It seems like we both want the same thing although with different approaches.</p>
<p>Fair.</p>
<p>&rt;The most I can do</p>
<p>Believe in yourself little one.  I do.</p>
<p>&rt;bring awareness to those around me about the struggles.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is all you can do... for now.  If that is the case do it well.  Perhaps that is what you are doing for me right now! yay!  You are helping see!  Isn't it fun!?!?  :)</p>
<p>&rt;I can’t fix someone’s living situation or mental health but I can provide advice.</p>
<p>Not with that attitude!</p>
<p>&rt;I was lost for many many years</p>
<p>As was I.  As are we all.</p>
<p>&rt;luckily</p>
<p>wiser than you look eh?  Good for you.</p>
<p>&rt;I know this isn’t the option for many due to that lack of education.</p>
<p>It is their lack of drive that holds them back not education (though the education system could do a better job of giving kids the tools to find their passions and thus, their drive).</p>
<p>&rt;It’s not fair</p>
<p>Were you promised fair?  Sorry that isn't how this works.  You want things better?  You gotta put in the work.  You know that.  Remember?  We just talked about this.</p>
<p>&rt;they are being pushed into a losing battle (mostly by parents)</p>
<p>Then we must first educate the parents!  We are adults now aren't we?  Let your voice be heard!  It is a beautiful one! :)</p>
<p>&rt; College simply shows you how to learn</p>
<p>It is supposed to teach you how to think.  Read the great works of the minds that came before so we don't need to relearn for ourselves what they already learned (and they were costly lessons indeed.  Why not copy their work when they offer it freely to us?)</p>
<p>&rt; I’m more concerned about how many generations will be able to come after ours, I love life and want others to be able to as well</p>
<p>I believe you. <em>hug</em></p>
<p>&rt;the path of destruction we are on will not give future generations that ability</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>&rt; There is no “me” in my mind</p>
<p>With all due respect (and I mean that, I respect you alot) you are a woman.  Your mind evolved to see things that way.  I am a man.  I see things differently.  That's all.</p>
<p>&rt;we are all a collective species that should be working towards the greater good for all even if it’s at the inconvenience of some.</p>
<p>Agreed.  But you need leaders.</p>
<p>&rt;Lives are more important than the economy</p>
<p>Define "economy" for me if you don't mind.  Everyone uses a different definition I have found.</p>
<p>&rt;education is more important than religion</p>
<p>What if I told you... they are one in the same?  I didn't used to think that.  I used to think like you.  ;)</p>
<p>&rt;we are all more important than any one of us individually</p>
<p>The most important minority, the ultimate minority, is the individual.  You care about minority rights don't you? ;)</p>
<p>&rt;As long as we are fighting together to bring every last person up to a higher level, we have done what we can</p>
<p>Agreed.  But I am in charge.  Deal?</p>
<p>&rt;If everyone was educated enough, we would never need government intervention but sadly we aren’t there.</p>
<p>Indeed.  Gay space communism is the ultimate goal but I... "we" need time to build it.</p>
<p>Wanna help?</p>

        <p>Abortion impacts yourself and, at worst, your family with an incredibly small chance of surgical complications being the only real risk (and may save your life if it's a medical emergency abortion).</p>
<p>An unvaccinated population affects, at a minimum, everyone over 65 making them stay home or die and extends the lockdown indefinitely making you bozos have to wear masks for the unforseeable future, creating the new normal you all seemingly want to avoid.</p>
