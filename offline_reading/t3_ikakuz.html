    <strong>Discussion</strong>
    <p><p>Are there any parents on here who‚Äôs kids have gone back to in person school(K-12)? I‚Äôm curious how it is been been for them (and y‚Äôall).
My kids have been back for almost two weeks (well two weeks on Wed) now.
According to my kids (14 &amp; 12), the teachers are already tired of all this shit. The teachers said the first week that they don‚Äôt like wearing the masks (&amp; some of the wear them wrong or not at all..when they can get away with it).
My youngest always wears his muzzle under his nose and only one kid fusses about it. The teachers (except for one) says ‚Äúok‚Äù and goes back to the lesson (the one teacher will remind my youngest to pull it up).
My oldest tries to be more subtle about it except in band. He always keeps it down when not playing and the band director says nothing. 
A few more kids in my youngest grade are starting to wear their muzzles under their nose. 
And a few more in band are following my oldest lead &amp; keeping their muzzle down when they are actively not playing their instruments. 
How about teachers? Any on here that have gone back to in person teaching? How is it for y‚Äôall?</p></p>

        <p>My son had his first day of 3rd grade today!  Our local districts are all remote, but we send him to a Catholic school.  Here is a sampling of the rules students have to endure:
1.  Masks ( of course) BUT he is autistic and attending mask-free under a medical exemption.  If somebody tests positive in his class, he will be forced to quarantine.<br>
2.  Socially distant desks
3.  Hand washing/sanitizing multiple times a day
4.  No singing in music class.  No band instruments
5.  Eat lunch in the lunchroom only 2x week.  The rest of time eat in the classroom.
6.  No water fountains.  Kids have to bring a water bottle.
7.  One way markers on stairs and corridors
8. Temp checks at drop off</p>
<p>There is more, but these are the big ones.  It is all rubbish, but it is better than Zoom school.  Sometimes you really do have to choose the lesser of two evils.</p>

        <p>Very true about the lesser of two evils (which we shouldn‚Äôt have to choice either). I dreaded the thought of online school. The district my kids were in a couple of years ago are doing that for the first three weeks. The parents I talked to about it were not happy about it. 
And at least they are allowing your son an exemption. My youngest said there is a girl with asthma that can wear a face shield.
My kids school is also doing the hand sanitizer and the spread out desk. One teacher has a small class and because they can be really spread out she allows them to be mask free.
Thankfully they are allowed to eat in the cafeteria everyday (but only four kids to a table)and they still have band and sports (this is the kids first year playing football). The school is pretty small so they don‚Äôt have choir so not sure what they would have done in that case.
I feel like my kids school is doing the bare minimum that they can get away with. Which does make me happy because they could be making their experience so much worse with all this pointless security theatre üòè</p>

        <p>this is heartbreaking, i can't believe anyone can support it.</p>
<p>i don't have kids, i don't know what i would do if i did have kids living through this. i think i would lose my damn mind.</p>
<p>all about conformity and obedience and nothing whatsoever to do with anyone's health or well being</p>
