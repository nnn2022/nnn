    <strong>Looking for some perspectives on why you aren’t getting vaccinated, preferably from pro-Vaxxers</strong>
    <p><p>No offense to anti-Vaxxers intended, I fully respect your beliefs even if mine differ a bit. Also not here to pose a contrarian viewpoint, I’m genuinely sketched out by this vaccine and wouldn’t have gotten it had it not been for the fact that I can’t see some family otherwise. Woke up feeling like death today, I spent 4 hrs getting tattooed prior to my vaccine and woke up with the spot where I was jabbed hurting exponentially more than the tattoos.</p></p>

        <p>Their “shut up and do it” mentality while not being even remotely transparent about basically anything going on between both the virus and the vaccine has my suspicions about the American government at an all time high. </p>
<p>I don’t get my flu shots every year either, but I do have all my other tried and true vaccines and so does my daughter, but my six year old isn’t getting this jab either. I’ll have her home schooled and I’ll work two jobs before my kid who has the rest of her life in front of her puts something in her body that could have serious affects 3-4-5-10 years down the line for all we know. I’m a firm believer that the old like trump and Biden can get it first since they’ve already lived their lives anyway. </p>
<p>Although I’m honestly not convinced all the elite have actually had it either, call me a conspiracy theorist.</p>

        <p>Yeah that’s the main reason I’m suspect. And You can’t voice even the most moderate opposition without being treated like crazy couples with The fact that you can’t sue Moderna or Pfizer is really unsettling as well.</p>

        <p>They stopped the swine flu vaccines in 1976 for six deaths.  It ended up being 53 deaths after all was said and done, but they were concerned after only six reports.  Now we've had over 9000 potential deaths on VAERS and we handwave it away.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because we aren't motivated by science, but quick solutions.  We are demonstrating no care or patience and that will potentially kill a lot of people who did not need to die.</p>
<p>If you were in a high risk group, the math might work out. That was originally the plan, but it keeps changing.  Much like releasing rabbits in Australia to solve one problem, and then having to release other animals to deal with the rabbits, we're likely to mark this down as one of the great human follies within a few years.</p>

        <p>I'm not anti-vax, in fact I have almost every vaccine recommended by doctors EXCEPT the annual flu shot and covid shot. </p>
<p>I don't get these shots because neither of these diseases are going to harm me. Furthermore, as you can see from the UK right now, not only do the vaccines not stop you from getting it, that of COURSE means you can still spread it. So the question is, why even bother risking the side effects of the vaccine? I had covid already, and it was a minor headcold for me. If that is all it is, and I have natural antibodies that last a year (as opposed to Pfizer which is already talking boosters... lol), I think that covid is now effectively the seasonal flu/cold as far as danger is concerned. We should only be vaccinating the at risk population, just as we have done with the flu since those vaccines were invented.. the young and healthy should just get covid, recover, and have natural immunity just as we have been doing with cold/flu since their inception.</p>

<p>Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson have both been sued in criminal lawsuits for lying about the safety and usefulness of different products for a net loss of over $30 billion between the two. These companies have already lost some trust with that fact alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moderna was worth billions before they ever made a single dollar in sales, which means that billions in allocated funds and assets absolutely REQUIRES Moderna to vaccinate as many people as possible to make money for their shareholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of these companies can be sued if their vaccine harms you in any way. They've already harmed hundreds of thousands of people with other products, that's how they got sued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It sets a crazy authoritarian precedent to require that the population has to consume a product into their bodies that comes from a company that is publicly traded for profit, in the S&amp;P 500 no less.</p>

<li>
<p>India was experiencing massive breakthrough cases in December/January and the global media ignored it. I saw very early on that the vaccines were very likely to start failing and cause more damage than good.</p>

<p>1) I am healthy and am at no risk for short- or long-term complications from these seasonal viruses. I treat my immune system with nutrients and rarely have seasonal illness anyway. Terrain theory is very real and an important aspect of overall health that doesn't require big pharma, medical intervention, etc. </p>
<p>2) An EUA is not the same thing as FDA approval, so I deign to be part of the control group in this global vaccine clinical trial, given that no vax manufacture can be held liable for any negative consequence from the vax, up to and including death.</p>
<p>3) These vax manufacturers have a long and sordid history of really nasty effects from their drug peddling. After multi-million and billion-dollar payouts, I don't trust them to produce a safe saline, let alone an injectable. I have successfully boycott J&amp;J, AZ, Pf, and more for their terrible and often disastrous "profits first" practices. I don't forget what they are capable of, and I don't forgive their atrocities against humankind. </p>
<p>4) The vax doesn't prevent the recipient from getting COVID, nor does it stop the spread. It only lessons the severity of disease for the person who had the vax. For a person of my health and vitality, the vax is, in effect, wholly unnecessary. The risk of vax complications is also unnecessary, and I am generally risk averse.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the reply. this is essentially how I felt although expressed far better than I could. I definitely didn’t feel as though I needed the vaccine, like you I’m healthy, take care of myself and rarely get sick. The reason I went through with it was I wouldn’t be able to see my aunt or grandmother unvaccinated, she’s got severe MS and lives across the country and my GM is in her 90s and very fragile atm so I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to see them again.</p>

        <p>Simply put, there is no reason for me to vaccinate. I'm now in the best shape of my life, no illnesses what so ever and I'm around 30 years of age. I live in Sweden where life has gone on almost as usual, gyms never closed (only a limit on how many can work out, and treadmills have a bit more distance between them), no forced mask wearing and those that use them are RARE here.</p>
<p>I've followed this "pandemic" since day one, checked the daily deaths almost every day and compared them to earlier years and I don't see this deadly virus so many are so deadly afraid of. Please check out EUROMOMO, it's a site that shows you the excess deaths from most EU countries. Norway and Finland had NO excess deaths throughout 2020 and Denmark I believe had excess deaths of only a few hundred, why is that?. But with Sweden you can see a clear spike in deaths in 2020 and early 2021, that is the deadly virus right? But why if you compare the total deaths/per capita with earlier years there were higher deaths per capita every year from the year 2000 to 2012 in Sweden and almost the same the most recent years with exception for 2019 which news reported had the lowest amount of total deaths for decades. There will always be "spikes" of more deaths, every country have them, be it a severe influenza year or a extreme cold winter and a higher % of the country's population reach the average life expectancy. </p>
<p>Add to this the constant fear mongering, ISOLATE, stay in your home or the virus will kill you. I believe this fear is very deadly for many vulnerable people. And if they get ordinary flu which mysteriously disappeared? and rushed to the hospital and put on a deadly ventilator which I believe probably killed more than it saved in 2020. No contact with loved ones when you´re hospitalized, everyone are masked so you can't see there faces and the fear for you is amplified.</p>
<p>One last thing about Sweden, one if the scandals you may have heard of is the terrible situation with our elderly where many were left without help. Especially in hospice care where many of the elderly never had doctors visiting them when they needed it the most, they only had phone calls with the help of some care takers and the most common medicine they were given was morphine, and nutrients through fluids. Many of them were left to die this way because the "experts" and "doctors" had a policy of it being the most humane way to live your last days. Family members were furious when they found out. I read news articles of sons and daughters coming to their elderly parents aid and demanding the stop of morphine injections and gave them proper food. And look and behold the elderly came through and lived on. I believe this incident added a lot of unnecessary deaths to 2020.</p>

        <p>I just am fully aware the motive here is profit. The dictated data and especially how they conveniently no longer even test the vaccinated is a big red flag, I'm not anti-vaccine whatsoever but when you look at how the illness is generally benign And you see the insane response in the constant conditioning enforced reality the media tries to push you know something's up.</p>

        <p>I’m not anti-vaxx but I’m anti mandatory vaxx. My family doesn’t need the vaccine. None of us is high risk. We are not morbidly obese and none of us have any underlying health issues. I’m a 40 year old female, 5’3” 115lbs, I exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet and have no health issues. I did not follow a single covid restriction-I went to the grocery store and box box stores multiple times a week when everything else was closed. I traveled out of state multiple times. I attended social gatherings with family and friends. No holiday was cancelled, we celebrated with friends and family like always. I wore a mesh mask in businesses but never outside. Less than 20,000 people between the ages of 40-49 have died of covid. My risk level is a zero. There is truly not a single reason I should take the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I'll keep short OP:</p>
<p>Took all sorts of vaccinations and preventative medication prior to deployments overseas (for over a decade).despite this, none, none of the "need" to take this "vax" has washed with me. Nothing adds up. This, coupled with my risk from the covid being absolutely miniscule. </p>
<p>Secondly, Partner is front line health care and took hers ages ago - we have kids and therefore I'm not having us both on experimental medication for something ultimately benign. My children's future must be navigated with their parents making the best risk assessments, until they can lead their own lives. </p>

        <p>It has been sinister from the very beginning. I have had all vaccinations and so have my children except flu jabs ( saw how much secret profit is made from them, all about money)  and I won't let my daughter get this new fangled HPV one when she's older. None of us are having the covid vax. Their dad had anthrax pumped into him in the forces and he's totally buggered. That was based upon lies too. Maybe if EVER proven safe on long term trials, but until then we will utilise out immune systems. The more they push it the more they show their disingenuous hands.</p>

        <p>I’m pro-vaccination under normal circumstances. I’m someone who has actually argued for vaccinations when people won’t vaccinate their children against dangerous diseases. I even used to get my child the flu vaccination. </p>
<p>That changed 2 years ago when vaccination teams were set up in my country. It meant I couldn’t safely get my child vaccinated at the GP which didn’t suit me as she has allergies. I’m convinced those vaccination teams were set up because this was all planned. </p>
<p>I don’t want to get an experimental vaccine for an illness less deadly than the flu. I won’t get a vaccine when I can still catch and die of the disease and also pass it on to others. Basically I see me getting the vaccine as making no difference to anything but potentially causing harm to myself if the vaccine is supposed to make Covid less of a danger to me if I get it. An argument I’ve heard is that the unvaccinated are creating the new variants but I’ve seen no evidence to prove this and also the creator of mRNA vaccines disagrees with this and believes it’s actually the vaccinated causing this. </p>
<p>I see the risks of blood clots, potentially getting shingles and many other things associated with the vaccination as more of a danger to myself than a virus that is mostly symptomless in my age group. </p>
<p>I also have an ethical opposition to a vaccine that is being pushed in such a divisive way with vaccine passports curtailing the freedoms of one group of people. The ethical argument for not getting the vaccination is by far the most important. Segregation in society based on an individual’s PRIVATE medical choices is not only completely unethical but also heading down a very dangerous route like racial segregation in America and South Africa, or even a step in the road towards what happened in Nazi Germany.</p>
