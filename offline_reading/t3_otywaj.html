    <strong>“Vaccine” Passports</strong>
    <p><p>What we know is that the virus is as transmissible in the vaccinated as unvaccinated.  We know that infection rates are high in vaccinated areas.  We know that the miracle Pfizer booster shot was tested on a total of 23 people and this “study” is how they are reporting efficacy.  We know that most masks don’t protect us from the virus.  Knowing all of this they still are discussing a passport.  This is not a passport for our health and safety - this is a passport so the government can have our private health information and track and trace us.  We must not let this happen.  The data does not support this, their agenda has become painfully clear.</p></p>

<p>Oh no. The government has all the info on you that it might ever need.</p>
<p>This is to enforce absolute control with absolute precision and zero effort.</p>
<p>Think europe. Most of EU had "you cannot literally walk outside your property without a good reason" orders for most of last winter. But: how do you enforce those?</p>
<p>Lots of people were indeed just out and about under the pretense of shopping for essentials, for example. How do you even enforce that? You would have to place cops at every corner and having checkpoints all over the place, 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>With this?</p>
<p>"From tomorrow, nobody can get out of their house except for essential shopping. Essential shopping is limited to 1 time per day per person". Swipe your green pass at the supermarket's entrance, you're locked out for the day from anything else. Zero effort enforcement.</p>
<p>And that would be <em>just</em> the beginning. Think of the possibilities.</p>

        <p>Have you ever heard of location tracking?</p>
<p>In the near future we will have trackers on our phones (which we need to register them under our names), there will be zero cash transactions so all digital transactions cam be traced. Where you have been to what you have spent on will all be recorded.</p>
<p>Think of it as something like Google location history it could plot out your travel times and paths, where you stopped, for how long, combining data from other users they could pinpoint whom you have interacted with, who handled your transaction, how long you were in the bathroom etc. They can even link them to nearby cctvs.</p>
<p>Big brother is always watching.</p>

        <p>Yep, they had all the tools before already, they just needed a trojan horse so that now they have an "official" tool you're required to use by law.</p>
<p>They knew where you were and what you did already. Now they don't need to claim they don't, and they can actually use that information against you, legally.</p>

        <p>We know that vaccines don't stop transmission.</p>
<p>We know that as recently as this week, the CDC admitted, they had no way of determining if you had covid or the flu.. as (surprise of surprises) the PCR test doesn't work to test infections..   </p>
<p>We also know from FOIA requests that no unvaccinated person has ever been found to have covid 19 isolated.   </p>
<p>So if they're going to issue passports, why not segregate all the dangerous vaccinated people who are spreading and killing each other with covid and vax side effects...  and just leave the rest of us healthy intelligent people the hell alone.</p>

        <p>22 healthy people. Should have tested 25,000 people over 80, obese, diabetic and hypertensive. That would have been a lot more useful</p>

        <p>Well all it takes is small amount of virus in your system to be tested positive, whether the virus is capable of multiplying in the vaccinated host, how efficiently can they multiply, and whether the vaccinated host will have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, or severe symptoms will determine how effective the vaccine &amp; booster shots are.</p>
<p>Case number no longer mean much when majority of the population is vaccinated, it's the severity and hospitalization cases that are important.</p>
<p>They need to rework on their statistic reporting to make the numbers more insightful.</p>
<p>I am an antivax but i won't discount the vaccine's efficiency just because there are positive cases among vaccinated group just to show why people shouldn't get vaccinated.</p>
