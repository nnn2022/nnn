    <strong>Why couldn't we have just isolated people who were at high risk.</strong>
    <p><p>Instead of making everyone give up their lives. The government would protect those at risk such as the elderly. They would work with business to protect older workers jobs for when COVID died down. Everyone else would go on with their normal life and build up some immunity. </p>
<p>Why was the sacrifice forced on everyone? COVID bubbles don't seem to be a thing except for a very small group of people.</p></p>

        <p>Using an alt account I stated this in March on my city subreddit and was downvoted into oblivion. Was told I wanted elderly to die (literally the opposite of what I was proposing) and that I didn’t understand the virus. They told me it was up to EVERYONE locking down to prevent spread to someone who could spread it to an at risk person. Basically everyone in a long line of people passing on the virus was responsible for someone who got it and died. I told them that anyone physically interacting with the very at risk should assume they have it and act as such, we needed to divert PPE to nursing homes (never saw a single FP Reddit post about the critical nursing home PPE and supplies shortages, just nurses bitching from empty ICUs, doing dances, standing outside for protests), and protect the at risk the most. Divert funds to supplementing their paychecks if they work, create mass grocery delivery access for those at home. Nope we had 30 something dweebs quaking in their boots clogging up grocery delivery streams.  Every time I went to the store, old people working, old people shopping. I said everyone healthy getting it will be needed to result in herd immunity. Was told I’m a moron and herd immunity doesn’t exist (???). I was told we need to fLaTtEn tHe CurVe (lol remember that?).</p>
<p>Yeah we’re real fucking heroes aren’t we. </p>
<p>I was using the data from Italy and China that shows little to no risk in healthy people under 60, no one cared about stupid data, everyone cared about buying toilet paper and making memes about saving grandma. </p>
<p>Then as time went on I learned that A) 30-70% of deaths in many cities are from nursing homes and B) “hard hit” NYC and NJ actively made a decision to send covid patients into nursing homes amidst their panic over ICU overrun.</p>
<p>And to this damn day this data is being pointed to to show just how “bad” the virus is. </p>
<p>I want to bash my fucking head into a wall. This topic makes my blood absolutely boil.</p>

        <p>Hospital capacity </p>
<p>To touch on that. Years ago it was determined that empty floors do not make money. Over the course of the last few decades hospital ceos and bean counters have learned to keep staff and space to a minimum to maximize profits. So over the course of a decade you can see a trend and staff for it with the correct amount of staff and equipment. When  something new causes a surge of people, the system overloads. Think lean manufacturing and just  in time models. That same model can be used to operate a hospital. From my family members that work in them, I heard every bad flu season "oh we are so understaffed blah blah". Thank the ceos and bean counters.</p>

        <p>I saw Fauci asked this question on Fox News and he said it’s because there’s no way to stop it from getting to high risk people. My response would be shouldn’t we do some cost-benefit analysis and realize there is low cost high benefit isolating grandma and high cost low benefit isolating normal people.</p>
<p>The real reason is people aren’t willing to accept the fact that the virus will run it’s course until we reach herd immunity. They’d rather participate in wishful thinking that will probably create more covid deaths.</p>

        <p>Masks don't protect you. That is false information that is spread by subs like these.</p>
<p>Edit: just to clarify, masks are there to protect others, not the wearer. Most masks end up offering some protection to the wearer but the virus still easily is cross contaminated to your mouth and you eyes will absorb the virus via the capillaries in your eye lids.</p>

        <p>n95 masks (supposedly) offer protection to the wearer.</p>
<p>If masks actually <em>work</em>, and actually protect people, then <em>that</em> is how we should protect the vulnerable.</p>
<p>I just dont understand the logic of people who say "masks protect people from Covid", but somehow also say we cant use masks to protect the vulnerable sector?</p>

        <p>They offer <em>some</em> protection. I mentionee this earlier. </p>
<p>Covid still easily spreads through the mouth and eyes which is why Covid spit particles will be filtered out but they will still land in your eyes. Or your hands will have them. Then when you neglect to disinfect your hands and take off the mask, you get it right in your mouth. Without the mask the particles land right on your mouth.</p>

        <p>So here are some ideas -</p>
<p><strong>PLAN A</strong></p>
<p>We go for herd immunity.</p>
<p>If you are a vulnerable person, you get an n95 mask for free.  And goggles, if you want.</p>
<p>If you are visiting with a vulnerable person, you should wear a mask.</p>
<p>Of course everybody should be diligent about handwashing.</p>
<p>(Maybe, once in a while, unfortunately, a vulnerable person ends up getting Covid and dying.)</p>
<p>OR ---</p>
<p><strong>PLAN B</strong></p>
<p>Vaccinate all the things!</p>
<p>We could totally restructure society and the planet to minimize Covid exposure to vulnerable people, and force people to vaccinate against their will, and cause all manner of domino-effect complications and unpredictable second-tier dangers.</p>
<p>Which plan do you like better?</p>
