        <p>Very good chance it didn't even happen. I bet half of these people are hanging out with friends and family on the down low, but tell themselves it is ok for them because reasons and it is only all those other people (mostly Republicans) that are the problem.</p>

        <p>This is honestly so retarded it could read as satire lol. Telling someone to put a mask on in their own home! These people are family for gods sake. Then being such an asshole virtue signaling piece of garbage that you won’t even spend Christmas with your parents and grandparents who are asking you to. These people don’t get that their parents and grandparents aren’t getting any younger, and one day your parents won’t be around to spend Christmas with you. All this over a flu. No, a bad cold for most people.</p>

        <p>Uhhh yeah you can catch stuff from family, I’m not saying that. I’m making a point that this guy is going out of his way to act holier than thou around his own family, telling his parents to wear a mask in their own house, stopping by to drop off presents but refusing to stay. Why come by at all if he’s actually so worried and makes a scene about not being able to stay? If he’s really that worried he would send the gifts in the mail and eliminate contact wHiCh CaUsEs ThE sPrEaD. The excuse you people have for the lockdowns and masks is to protect the elderly and vulnerable, but it doesn’t seem like his parents and older family care.</p>

        <p>The dude’s approach seemed to be, “We want to see everyone, but there is a pandemic, so it will have to be a quick visit and we should all stay masked to protect each other. Better than nothing, right?” </p>
<p>How is that such an unreasonable approach that you can’t believe this person is “real”? What does the fact that it was his parents’ house have to do with wanting them to mask up to limit potential exposure? What does the fact that some old people don’t care about the virus have to do with whether or not it’s a good idea to spread it around more than necessary? Like, the fact that grandma doesn’t care about dying from Covid isn’t a gotcha you can throw at people wearing masks. You get that, right? </p>
<p>This anger directed at strangers just trying to make responsible choices in a difficult and confusing situation seems like a strange choice. Why not be mad at the virus? Do you think this person normally avoids family at Christmas, and the pandemic is just showing up some character flaw that has been there all along? Why just there always be some person to blame or look down on?</p>

        <p>I’d feel ashamed as a parent if my kid became a brainwashed idiot who had so little importance and could contribute so little to society that they partake in miserable group think just to feel good about themselves. Pretty messed up if bragging to strangers on the internet about how you refuse to spend the holidays with your parents/grandparents over a cold is how you feel good about yourself.

        <p>I don’t get the logic. If the people that are actually at risk of getting very sick and possibly dying are completely okay with taking that risk, why do they feel the need to take such a hard stance? I get that some of it is brainwashing, but like, what goes thru their heads? “They don’t know it but I’m protecting them” like I don’t understand the logic here</p>

        <p>Superiority complex. Thinking their parents can’t assess and take their own risks so this person, being so <em>intelligent</em> (pretentious), obviously must make the hard decisions for others who aren’t capable of understanding the science and virtue of obeying covid “guidelines”.</p>

        <p>When someone decides they're more 'intelligent' than someone else and decide that means they have to make decisions for them 'for their own good', it doesn't end well. If the people who are actually at risk are happy to take that risk then who are you trying to protect? They don't want that, and that's their choice.</p>

        <p>My friend just told me that his parents won't allow him inside WITH a mask right now. He is staying at a hotel instead because he won't take the mask off. Impressive for his parents to stick to their guns and hold down their house rules.</p>

        <p>The people who come on here and say 'wear a mask' without a real argument and sometimes when it's not even about masks are probably bots. The up votes on this are bots. Some of the posts like this are bots. Remember, reddit and the Internet in general do not present the real general opinion. For one, there's a higher concentration of virtue signallers on the Internet because that's where they virtue signal. People brainwashed by the Internet spend more time on the Internet. Secondly, it's censored to make it look like the popular opinion is this kind of thing. This is probably because there are enough skeptics to win, but if we continually think our opinion is unpopular we'll try to blend in and go along with it because alone we are not powerful enough to change anything. It's to prevent us from coming together to resist.</p>

        <p>Seems to be a big trend at this point. You got the 30 somethings that wear a mask to walk down to their mailbox, and their 60-70 something parents begging them to come over for the holidays. </p>
<p>Your average redditor would say it’s because the younger people are more informed. More like more brainwashed 🙄</p>
<p>As far as younger people go, like 18-26, unless you’re an extreme lefty, you really don’t give a fuck. My friends and I will wear them in a store, but it stops there. Gives me some hope. Seems to really be the millennials going overboard</p>

        <p>Gen Z doesn't care too much, like you said, we'll wear them in stores and at school, but that's where it ends. Still sucks. It's really only the far left ones in our generation that want people to wear masks everywhere and virtue signal online, but even they themselves don't always practice what they preach. Millennials are certainly more afflicted by this.</p>

        <p>Is your sister holding the fact that she's having the first niece/nephew over your head and threatening to not let you see it unless you meet her demands to prove that you are being safe? I see a lot of that bullshit going on right now and it pisses me off. I understand if you are between a rock and a hard place right now. But it is your home and you should be able to what you want. My dad's dumb girlfriend wears a mask around me and my toddler but I refuse to wear one. If she was truly worried about COVID, then she shouldn't come over. Period. Otherwise, I'm not wearing a mask in my own home but she is welcome to wear one if she wants.</p>

        <p>Wow, that’s crazy!</p>
<p>Could it be perhaps because you have really strict mask rules on campus in the US? Because I saw a pic recently from one university and it was like a proper threatening sign about having to wear a mask even outside, and they emphasised the “even outside” part, and maybe he was just used to it?</p>

        <p>No there isn’t a mask mandate for outdoors on campus. In Wisconsin there isn’t a mandate requiring people to wear a mask outdoors either so idk why people on campus or near campus wear it everywhere when they don’t have to.</p>

        <p>Oh, well in that case he’s a fucking idiot! Well, all of them are. </p>
<p>I guess the picture with the sign of a university to wear masks everywhere I saw musta been from California then 😂</p>
<p>Gosh it’s so sad to think that it was my childhood and teenage dream to live there, and they’re just fucking it up so badly now ha ha ha .. (that was more of a sarcastic apocalyptic laugh for California as oppose to actually laughing, you know like when someone’s relative dies and they’re just like: he he he...)</p>
<p>I’m from the UK by the way so that’s why I was intrigued with the mask rules, as far as I’m aware you don’t have to wear them outside</p>

        <p>Maybe you should re-evaluate when the actually somewhat at risk older people are no longer taking the extreme precautions you take. I've seen countless comments from reddit where the older parents want to be visited and socialize. They probably realize that they don't have that many years left and that they want to spend them with family and friends.</p>

        <p>A friend just posted a pic of his parents opening gifts from the family OUTSIDE, WEARING MASKS. It's below freezing here! Someone else posted a pic of her mom (mask-free) with her masked grandchildren. Believe me, in deep-blue land, people are really doing this. Then again, my ultra-Dem neighbors in their 60s had such a loud family party tonight that I was actually grumbling a bit about the noise.</p>

        <p>I definitely think the people who are mask and lockdown crazy aren’t even truly Democrats, they’re socialists on the verge of becoming full blown communists. All in denial of how radical their ideologies are becoming. I think today’s Democratic Party is really just the communist party parading behind a more socially acceptable name.</p>

        <p>I know someone who is constantly ordering other people to STAY HOME, WEAR A MASK, OR ELSE - she has a little bit of power over others less fortunate, and she wields it. She is radical and quite possibly a communist - calls people “comrades” and such.</p>

        <p>I just had to suggest to a covidiot on /r/news that the reason she still got severe covid while taking drastic measures to protect her « irresponsible and hateful » elderly mom who was still socializing and didn’t get sick, was that her fear and self-isolation got her immuno-depressed. Lets see if she’s capable of self-reflection or a lost cause.</p>

        <p>This person hates their family and is using covid measures as an excuse. They are finally obligated by law not to have to hang out with their family for Christmas (which is something they've always hated doing) AND they get to virtue signal about it online afterwards to atone for any lingering guilt they have by getting upvoted for their "bravery". Lowest form of human right there.</p>

        <p>Thank you! I wish my dad would listen! He goes on and on about masks. I farted in his face yesterday after testing positive for COVID. I'm a little worried because he has an eye infection now and thinks he has COVID. What a sheep!</p>

        <p>Grandma wants him to stay lmao. She’s a grown fucking adult and can decide for herself if she wants to risk it (which is like a cold for the majority of people, including elderly). Our parents and grandparents aren’t getting younger and the holidays are precious times to spend together as we never know if there will be another Christmas.</p>
