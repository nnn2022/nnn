<p>My borough is now locked down again for up to six months, with fortnight updates. For this. This is a small glimpse into the power we have all given over to a thoroughly compromised and corrupt government. I use my local example to highlight the general pattern....</p>
<p>Things to keep in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever they are vague about (such small numbers of) victims , we can be assured they were in the 80s and/or riddled with co-morbidities</li>
<li>Whenever they talk about cases, you must remember these are not infections, hospitalisations or deaths (and any rises can be ascribed to increased testing)</li>
<li>The current emphasis on local authorities in the UK (and mayors in the US) is leading us into the commUNitarian agenda, whereby they 'rule' over their districts according to sustainable Agenda 2030 arrangements and targets.</li>

        <p>Our government does the same. And that was when I realized this was a huge scam.</p>
<p>Statics shows ages 0-70, then 70-80, 80-90, 90-120 something like that.</p>
<p>Then there is something like Sweden were they show almost every age group.</p>
<p>That was when I realized that this was a scam. Barely anyone was under the 0-70 and these who were probably were aged 67 with tons of commodities.</p>
<p>And I used to read so many news about the virus since January and were tired of our governments not taking the virus serious.</p>
<p>Now I have changed opinion months later when the truth came out.</p>
