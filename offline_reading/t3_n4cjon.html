        <p>A big complaint I had in school was everyone was dependent on someone else to learn. I was hyperlexic as a child and always enjoyed reading, so I never understood when the other kids had to be spoon fed information. It’s like they couldn’t teach themselves, or use any form of critical thinking. It was just a regurgitation of the class lecture in the form of choice A, B, C, or D. It’s set up to make kids dependent on authority figures for facts and information.</p>

        <p>I don’t hold it against my parents, they did what they felt like they had to. It’s what they, and most everyone else, know. No one asked to be born, yet here we are. </p>
<p>No, I blame the ones who created this system. Something has been going on since the dawn of mankind and thats a power struggle. It’s always been about control and using others for their benefit. Mankind wises up over time and thats when the game changes. Take 2019 for example... there were riots and protests all over the world. Funny how the Hong Kong protests happen and all of a sudden, here we are. Now China, nor anyone else has to worry about people rising up. Unless its against something fabricated, something that will create divide amongst the population... something like the protests targeted towards race.</p>

        <p>But if you don't understand the mistakes that made you, how can you hope to avoid your children being subject to the same mistakes? Why is my small point not talked or discussed. Ever? </p>
<p>I can't change the perpetual global power struggle. I can make sure my daughter doesn't end up being raised by a rotating staff of strangers, who want nothing more than to indoctrinate her into being some perverted shadow of her humanity... like me.</p>

        <p>And that is where you hit the nail on the head. We have to learn from everything. I have a daughter myself, so it is up to me to do better for her than what was done for me. She is in the public educational system, but I have no control over that legally. So I do my best to guide her in every way I can.</p>

        <p>Homeschooling is illegal? There's been massive innovation in that sector in the last decade with homeschooling "pods" and 3 day/week schools and stuff. In fact, it's something I've had in the back of my mind to open one of those up after I'm done with the military (which seems will happen before the military is done with me). But I'm in the states. At least if we tell big brother to F off, it's not that far out of the norm.</p>

        <p>Bummer. Sorry to hear that. If things keep going like this I don't know how long my wife and I will stay together. </p>
<p>She's a full on believer in the covids. Got the shots and all. Says the "wants more kids" but has allowed herself to become clinically obese (and of course it's somehow my fault). And I won't have sex with her because I find fatness disgusting. So... now... here we are.</p>
<p>Stuck with a daughter I love and a wife who is becoming increasingly insufferable. In hindsight, there were some glaring signals I should have seen when I first started dating her. But no one taught me fuck all about anything that has to do with relationships or selecting a mate. </p>
