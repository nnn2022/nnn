    <strong>I'm curious if it would be possible to fight astroturfing, with astroturfing?</strong>
    <p><p>Hear me out.</p>
<p>Astroturfing firms exist. Nothing new.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to sign an NDA before even talking to/negotiating with them.</li>
<li>They each specialize in certain fields or topics. </li>
<li>Their pricing structure varies for repeat posting, for answer posting, and for pretend negative posting that encourages a positive response they then agree with. It gets pretty detailed. This is some people's 9-5.</li>
<li>The people they employ, generally know nothing about each field.</li>
<li>They get 3-5 "hit point" sentences and just repeat them over and over again. The rest is just basic creative writing.</li>
<li>Occasionally used to disparage competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your favorite brands do this on a variety of social media platforms, politicians very obviously engage in this, and it's incredibly likely the biggest subs are swimming with these accounts. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/6iaxcs/what_ive_learned_phishing_for_shill_ips/">A lot might even be bots.</a> Likely that this continues into various state/city subreddits on a smaller scale. For example I don't doubt that individual cities or states have paid these firms to push pro-lockdown sentiments on "public discussion forums" (IE Reddit, Twitter) to sway public opinion and just lumped the costs under PSA campaign expenses. </p>
<p>Maybe it's just something for r/showerthoughts but I see an opportunity to fight fire with fire here.</p>
<p>Use these firms to flood social media with anti-lockdown sentiment at a level never seen before. Subs typically pro-lockdown would be suddenly unable to keep up with the influx of users who downvote them and provide somewhat organic arguments.</p>
<p>Would this work?</p></p>

        <p>I love the idea. Fire with fire. How much does a campaign usually cost? Which social media should be targeted? How will censorship algorithms be evaded? I actually think a good message would be more "pro connection" rather than anti-lockdown. Bots could say, "Hugged my friend today, it felt so great!" etc.</p>

        <p>I hate it. The reason I want to fight these people in the first place is for shit like this. I would rather expose and shame that type of strategy to the people on their side so that they can see the type of shit they resort to.</p>
<p>Edit: if I put on my “win at all costs” hat it’s a fucking good idea though. And the comment below mine had some great input, I know it would work.</p>
