    <strong>Just Go On r/CovidVaccinated and See The Side Affects For Yourselves. And The Worst Part? They Are Still Saying, Take It.</strong>
    <p><p>Legit every other post there is about the severe side affects they are having. And if they don't got the side affects, after couple weeks/months they are getting them. And most people seem to be young on that sub.</p>
<p>Why should any person be required to take a "vaccine" which has not been tested properly and made in a rush, and which the long term side affects aren't even known? Also, for a disease which has a 99.7% survival rate. So basically take a rushed vaccine, which can have harmful affects in future when it's highly likely you will survive corona! How cool. We are truly a progressive society.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, these people are ... no words for them. Religious vaccine exemptions is still a thing in in USA and Canada, and I think we can bypass the vaccine by that. But let's see. In these unpredictable times, you can't say anything.</p></p>
