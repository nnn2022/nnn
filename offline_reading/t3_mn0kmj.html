    <strong>What most people do not realize is that the Vaccine/Health Passport is the perfect doorway towards complete digital tyranny</strong>
    <p><p>Many people focus on the problems with this vaccine when they discuss the passport. </p>
<p>And I agree, there are many potential problems we should be discussing. Long-term side-effects have never been assessed on vaccines that are based on mRNA technology, since vaccines containing this technology of immunization have never been so widely distributed in history and this one has never undergone testing over several years. <a href="https://www.geertvandenbossche.org/">There are highly acclaimed virologists that are sounding the alarm that mass vaccination in this manner can create a series of further viral mutations</a>, while many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIcV3rmk9hM">other problems might be present</a> as well (not even delving into the potential <a href="http://vaccinepapers.org/">neurological issues aluminum based adjuvants can cause</a>).</p>
<p>But that's not even the main problem. The main problem is that once vaccine passports are active, the authoritarian imposition such a digitized document can create on the human populace is truly massive. Think of China's Social Credit System, then consider this system being rolled out for billions, without even the transparent authoritarianism that the CPP shows, but instead masking it as something done for "your own health and safety".</p>
<p>If you truly believe that what is now called a vaccine passport will only remain a passport pertaining to vaccines (or even just THIS vaccine), you are living in a fairy land. Based on the country you are in, such a technology distributed so widely and accepted so freely can create possibilities for countless medical and social-based add-ons that can be tacked on, while the person remains helpless to resist further and further impositions. Why? Because the passport has already been socially accepted - everything tacked on will just be brushed aside by the media and seen as "part of the deal", while being renamed to a "health" or just a "safety" passport.</p>
<p><a href="https://rumble.com/vf90xx-naomi-wolf-on-vaccine-passports.html">As Naomi Wolf (who speaks mainly from a perspective of being a tech CEO here) explains well in this video</a>, the potential of data gathering and population mapping can be increased exponentially by virtue of a system of surveillance and control so completely accepted and integrated into a society.</p>
<p>You may say that to a degree we already have that and point to your phone - but this is not the same thing. You can turn off your smartphone and still visit bars, clubs, still travel freely, still go to school or a University. You may be deprived by some information and abilities due to the tech immersed society we live in, but you can still, if you so choose to, function and live in a society where you keep the data gathering, surveillance and authoritarian impositions made possible by technology to a bare minimum. You can still live low-tech and even if you live high-tech, you can learn to avoid the pitfalls if you tread wisely.</p>
<p>With vaccine passports and whatever else might get tacked on to them, this freedom may easily slip away. It will all happen slowly and in the name of safety and security. Either related to this infection or a different one, related to terrorism, global warming (and no, I'm not denying the horrific impact humans have on the environment, but authoritarian impositions will not make this better and most likely aren't even there for that purpose)....etc.</p>
<p>Think of how easily such a system can become abused. <em>If you are a person that is discussing things on social media that are threatening to mega-corporations or corrupt governmental policies, you can simply be labeled as "sick" (i.e. a PCR test can be faked, making you perpetually positive for this or a different virus) on the passport and prevented from even participating in society!</em> (prevented from using anything that a vaccine/health passport will be integrated in, from travel, work, shopping...)</p>
<p>Remember that the worst thing that can happen is that this is accepted widely, with open arms, by an afraid population that believes everyone in position of power either has their best and highest good in mind OR if we go by Hanlon's Razor and see them as ignorant fools, that they even truly know what they are doing.</p>
<p>The solution is of course in the power of numbers, which is related to the spreading of awareness and information and getting people to see where this is very likely leading. If the majority chooses to opt out of the system of imposed control and surveillance, that system <em>cannot exist!</em> Remember, we still live in a society where the monetary participation and labor of regular people (as opposed to a completely automated AI-based society which might come in the future) is needed to sustain the economic balance and functioning of our society - so all of us ARE very much needed for things to function, even for people in positions of power. If we opt out and help others see the importance of opting out, while vocally and by virtue of our actions resisting these changes, we can retain our freedoms. </p>
<p><em>If we wish to spread such information, we need to spread it in a calm, rational, critical and well sourced fashion.</em> <strong>This is extremely important.</strong> Sharpen your arguments and calm your mind (meditative practices can be useful here) when speaking to people about this - and don't spread obvious nonsense and theories that have very poor sources. The calmer you are and more precise your arguments are, the more likely people will listen with an open mind (and yes, some will never listen, that is inevitable).</p>
<p>Even if you are terrified of this virus, or simply wish the lockdowns to go away, do not let your fear or anger move you into accepting the loss of ever more freedoms - if we all yield now, we will be sorry in the years to come. </p>
<p>There is still hope for things to change, there always is, so never give up. <strong>Never give up.</strong></p>
<p>And don't forget to breathe. Sending you lots of love in these unusual times.</p>

<p>Edit: a commenter linked this article on the dangers of the implementation of a digital health (vaccine) passport or ID from a perspective of a computer technician. It's great and very much worth the read:</p>

        <p>I think it has very little to do with the vaccine. The vaccine is just to get their foot in the door. Then they can start gently adding more and more until it's total tyranny. I think this is why they want all sales moved online. So they can prevent dissidents from buying necessities eventually. They want a cashless society where everything can be tracked.</p>

        <p>Spot on.</p>
<p>They can use this virus as an excuse to control the population in a scale never seen before. It's not even about surveillance, since that already exists, but movement control.</p>
<p>I was talking with "normie" co-workers yesterday and they are totally oblivious to the implications of a vaccine passport and don't even care about it. Many were actually in favour of this because of how scared they are of the virus and say that we should do whatever we can to stop it. One even told me that if he was in charge he would just have people be shot if the population refused to follow the rules.</p>
<p>I fear for the future, these people are completely delusional, afraid and will gladly give up their liberty just to have the chance to go to a bar or restaurant and go on vacation again.</p>

        <p>I think you are too naive.
Do you think a vaccine passport that basically takes away the freedom of movement in a country and removes your ability of going to certain events, activities and visiting certain places is not a huge concern?
Do you also believe that the possibility of abusing a system like this won’t be used at the slightest opportunity?</p>
<p>You are basically okay with giving up your freedom by being a guinea pig for a vaccine against a virus that is mostly harmless.</p>

        <p>They died <em>with</em> covid not <em>from</em> covid. The facts are clear, it’s only dangerous for people of old age with over 2 co morbidities.</p>
<p>There are plenty of doctors against lockdowns, mandatory vaccinations and other restrictions. What we are seeing is the craziest overreaction in decades, and they are using this virus as an excuse to take away the freedom of people and guys like you aren’t even seeing it or care about it.</p>
<p>The fact that you actively participate in this shit without even a shred of critical thinking shows me that you have fallen for the propaganda and fear mongering. </p>
<p>If you want to vaccinate, do it. If you want to stay home 24/7, do it. Just don’t force other people to do it as well.</p>

<p>I think there's something wrong with the vaccine, and they also want to implement more control and tracking via the passport. Both of these are very likely.</p>

        <p>A cashless society is something being driven by the profits of convenience from widespread market desire, not government pressure. I don't use PayPal or online banking because the government told me to, it's because I like the service. </p>
<p>Now, the government may try to misuse this, which is what I think you are trying to say and I don't disagree there necessarily. But rather than attack the idea of a cashless society itself as a bad thing. I'd rather ask, how can we limit  government surveillance with respect to these systems by improving privacy laws, since they may not be inherently bad for people.</p>

        <p>I would agree here and simply point out again, as I did in another comment, that humanity at this point is simply not mature enough for the rapid technological progress that has occurred within the last century (especially the later part of it). As one of my favourite philosophers, Ken Wilber points out, we are living in a flatland, as we have denied that any sort of internal progression towards greater awareness, responsibility, empathy, wisdom... is even possible. We believe industry and technology will somehow save us from our own stupidity.</p>
<p>But this is incorrect, the tool is only as good as the person that uses it. We have split the atom and instead of using that power purely for beneficial purposes our immaturity has helped us create the most destructive weaponry in history.</p>
<p>The same is true for a cashless society. We simply are not yet collectively ready for that level of tech advancement and thus it is ripe for abuse by a variety of private and governmental entities.</p>
<p>It's not the technology that's the problem, it's us.</p>

        <p>I actually like cash and don't want to go cashless, but I don't see people moving away from digital finance or currencies either. So my opinion is that we need to change how we allow the government to interact with the internet rather than stepping away from these kinds of things altogether.</p>

        <p>I think a lot more people know than admit it.  I have two co-workers that absolutely do not want to hear it.  If I talk to them alone, they admit and understand what is going on..but they do not want to admit it...so, they immediately go right back to sticking their proverbial heads in the sand.  They are so focused on getting things back to the way they used to be...normal.  They don't want to hear that it will never go back to that.</p>

        <p>Yes, I agree. But perhaps the more those people realize that things will not go back to normal, the more they will be open to listening.</p>
<p>Often I even wonder what "normal" people even wanted to go back to (<a href="https://embraceyourexperience.com/2020/10/our-society-cannot-return-to-normal-as-it-was-never-normal-to-begin-with.html">which is something I wrote an article about a while back</a>)? For most this normality was a shitty existence, with meager economic prospects, while looming environmental and social catastrophes were looking at our collective faces that nobody desires or desired to tackle.</p>
<p>Ideally society should be progressing and not regressing, so what was normal yesterday should be upgraded into a better "normal", with more freedom and prosperity for all. With automation being at an all time high and still increasing, while many parts of society seem to be degenerating, it may be wise to reconsider what most techno-topians consider progress. If technological progress is not balanced with inner wisdom, intelligence, empathy...we find ourselves exactly where we are headed - into a technocratic dystopia.</p>

        <p>Watch some Edward Snowden interviews even documentaries. As much as I agree with you, digital Tyranny had already fully happened then. Now millions of people literally just voted for the man who enacted the unconstitutional as ruled by our court system spying network/policies of then Vice President Biden that Snowden brought to light. As much as I thought Trump was better than Biden for a time, he also called Snowden a traitor. Left and right are Two wings of the same corrupt bird.</p>

        <p>I agree. But still I think that with every add-on to the already present tyranny, with every extra fork in the road towards authoritarianism, we collectively have the ability to point to the public what is happening and thus raise awareness due to these obvious impositions.</p>
<p>Every time more things like this happen, I believe more awareness should be raised, as every added layer of control is both a blessing and a curse. A curse for obvious reasons, but a blessing because the added layer has the possibility of waking more people up to the insanity of the current situation.</p>
<p>You know what they say, the deeper the drunk falls into his stupor, the higher the chance he might perceive it as rock-bottom and change course. With every added layer, an invisible line is crossed in the minds of some people - the more awareness we raise, the higher the likelihood of those people speaking out and those lines ultimately being crossed for everyone.</p>

        <p>To me- conditioning a majority of the population into accepting it is a prime objective of this choreographed crisis.</p>
<p>The thinking could be: make us weary of restrictions and the gloom and doom media assault and eventually we'll accept just about anything if we believe the barrage will go away.</p>
<p>In light of that there's a logic to Fauci's odd lack of optimism with the decrease of numbers in states like Texas and Florida- that the numbers are improving- OR more likely, that the media is actually making them available and not sticking with the playbook.</p>
<p>This has not smelled right almost from the get-go when it was "two weeks to flatten the curve".  That was the proverbial foot in the door.</p>

        <p>What most people on HERE don't realize is that this whole thing is first and foremost about PROFIT. A mandatory vaccine passport = guaranteed profit for the pharmaceutical industries and all other industries that are involved in the production of the "covid" "vaccine" including the steel industry because the cap on the bottle of the "vaccine" is made from a steel derivative. THEY FORCE YOU TO BUY A PRODUCT YOU DON'T NEED (THEY BUY THOSE "VACCINES" WITH YOUR TAX MONEY). THEY HAVE CUT EXPENSES ON PUBLIC EDUCATION AND PUBLIC HEALTHCARE SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT - SO THAT THEY CAN SPEND THE MONEY FROM THE TREASURY NOT ON SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS, BUT ON THEIR PRODUCT. WITH THIS MANDATORY "PASS" / AUSWEIS THEY MAKE SURE THAT YOU BUY THEIR PRODUCT (THAT YOU DON'T EVEN NEED) ON A REGULAR MANDATORY BASIS (BECAUSE THE VACCINE WILL HAVE TO BE RENEWED SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR). THIS MEANS GUARANTEED PROFIT FOR THEM. It's an open dictatorship of finance capital which merged with industrial capital a long, long time ago. OPEN DICTATORSHIP OF CAPITAL = FASCISM. Most people on this website are not involved in material production, so they completely forget that it's the basis of human existance. ECONOMY COMES FIRST. Not some abstract tyranny, not some abstact evil "nature". It's all about economy which revolves around material production.</p>

I think you’re right though, your average joe doesn’t understand how this species actually functions. Money is a biological trade-off. Organisms in nature will fight and be selfish for food to benefit their own survival... likewise, we do that for money, to benefit ours. </p>

        <p>This is where I stand.  I think the vaccine is just a vaccine, not a microchip or hormone injection.</p>
<p>The conspiracy is the fact that big pharma is profiting off mandatory vaccines, and big tech is using them as an opportunity to control every aspect of our lives.</p>

        <p>Does anyone have a good response to the, "Muh private companies can do whatever they want," counterargument?</p>
<p>I usually try to argue that the market isn't free when big tech is just doing the government's dirty work, and the market definitely isn't free when businesses are forced to choose between their Zuck passport and frivolous COVID lawsuits.  But that doesn't seem to satisfy anyone.</p>

        <p>Part of the issue I see is many of us who are against this are also very pro "private business can do what they want". I think that is true within limits. In the USA, the tyranny may well come from corporations or at least be enforced by them. Evil must be resisted no matter who is delivering it. I support Desantis having banned these for business too. I know a lot of libertarians are against protected classes but I think the way to kill this isnt to ban the government from using it. Its to make it illegal. A way of doing this is the medical privacy side of it. I fully expect the USA social credit system to not be mandatory but like the mask situation in places with lifted mandates, enforced by best practices and corporate policy. That seems to shut down most who resist it because of our support for private business.  I believe business should mostly be able to do what they want but some things do need to be illegal. </p>
<p>Those who control the money are the ones in charge and in the case of the USA, that is not always the government itself</p>

<p>Firstly for the sake yourself as no matter how bad it gets there will still be plenty to live for, secondly for all the people that will be heartbroken if you do so and will miss you (even if it's just one person, that's enough), and third for the sake of all humanity. Every human that is aware enough that sees what is going on now in the world is someone we direly need in this time of mass ignorance and unconsciousness. By simply being one of those that can see what's going on and spreading the message even a little bit, you are doing a grand service for us all.</p>

        <p>I have a passport so I can enter other countries. I also have a smartphone with technology, enabling it to track me wherever I go. Maybe I should dispose of both items and just become a hermit?</p>

        <p>I'm OK with having us show our vaccine card. I just refuse to have a digital passport because of everything you just said. Even if the government doesn't use it for malicious purposes, companies like Facebook will.</p>

        <p>In the expansive way they wish to be implemented now most certainly not.</p>
<p>You only need to be vaccinated (with long tested vaccines might I add) when visiting a handful of countries.</p>
<p>What is being proposed now is something completely different and more akin to a digital ID slowly set to expand into every area of our society.</p>
<p>There has been no crisis quite as global as this one for a long time now , so no previous vaccine / health passports could ever be (or were pushed to be) made so expansive. Neither would the public accept it before now, since they have never been dosed by as much fear by the media previously.</p>

        <p>This is so dumb, its just a giant "but what if it's abused?" </p>
<p>Having a vaccine passport will not effect me in anyway, I'll get the vaccine, I'll get the card if it becomes a thing, pretty much no effect on my life, and jf they want to make it digital, great.</p>
<p>&rt; Oh but they might add on additional medical and social stuff</p>
<p>Sounds great, a digital passport with my medical data, would make my life more convenient. Throw in all my other shitty data like driving license, NI number, birth certificate. Give me a negative to this. </p>
<p>And social add ons, like what? I want a negative for this because I honestly don't know what this is or why it's bad.</p>
<p>Oh but the government will be able to track everything I do, truly scary, they'll be able to see that I do literally nothing of interest and have a shit music taste. </p>
<p>Your entire argument against it can't just be the fact it could be abused. Give an actual negative, give me an actual reason to hate, rather than some hypothetical "what if government is CCP."</p>
