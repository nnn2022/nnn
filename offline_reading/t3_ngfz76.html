        <p>This dude is being cancelled for something he allegedly did in 1989. </p>
<p>I wonder what the real reason could be.</p>

        <p>I'm wondering if the following happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin is told the whole truth about what these vaccines will eventually do to all mankind (e.g. mass sterilization project, or depopulation project). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He tries to investigate further how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He realizes he does indeed have a heart ‚ù§ and a conscienceüòì, and decides to do something about it.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He starts emailing some trusted individuals, as well as reviews info from silenced critics of this New Normal world we live in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He then discusses in private with those who he thought was on his side, and/or who he thought would not divulge their conversation to others. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low and behold someone higher-up gets wind of how he truly feels about "the Plan", and decides to remove him through some fake-ass trumped-up charges (typical honeypot and/or sexual misconduct ploy done many times over by the DeepState). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Or maybe he did do some sexual misconduct, but the timing is highly suspicious. I hope in time the truth will be told to all of us.</p>

        <p>Me too, anything mentioned by any major news outlet is suspect and I really can't trust the MSM. The only good thing about the MSM is that whenever they peddle some b.s. article or story, then I turn to alternative independent journalists to see what their take is, as well as see how other nations spin the same story, and from there I can find some truth in the middle (if at all). All I know is that we're all being played, and if we don't figure out the puzzle soon then it might be too late for all of us.</p>

        <p>I'd say we're on schedule.</p>
<p>"Projected supply chain break downs, inventory shortages, large economic instability. Expected late Q2 2021."</p>
<p>This is happening.</p>
<p>"Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area. Expected by Q3 2021."</p>
<p>Plenty of time for this to happen. In fact, they're already set up in Toronto.</p>

        <p>I agree but these are a little late or didn't end up working out. </p>
<p>Reform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program. Expected by Q1 2021.</p>
<p>Projected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection. Expected by February 2021.</p>
<p>Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical care facilities capacity. Expected Q1 ‚Äì Q2 2021.</p>
<p>Enhanced lockdown restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed (including inter-province and inter-city). Expected Q2 2021.</p>
<p>Transitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program. Expected mid Q2 2021.</p>

        <p>UBI is basically CERB or CRB. </p>
<p>The variants already happened and we saw more cases. The cases, as you're aware, are easy to increase with PCR shenanigans. Deaths, not so much.</p>
<p>Third wave lockdown definitely happened. In fact we're still in it. Ontario and Quebec have restricted travel and curfews. All provinces have become more restrictive. I'm in NB and even though we're in Yellow phase, we cannot leave the province without a mandatory 2 week isolation upon return. Crazy.</p>
<p>Obviously the leaked memo can't get everything precisely right but it has played out fairly accurately up until now. The market collapse is already beginning and I'm curious to see if the IMF debt relief comes to fruition.</p>
<p>Most Canadians, especially those who have bought a house recently, are heavily indebted. Throw in an economic collapse that causes massive financial loss and unemployment and they will be ripe for this debt relief. Since the debt relief comes with the condition of mandatory vaccination (so sketch, why would that be a condition?) that should coerce a significant portion of the unvaccinated to comply. Then who's left? Most old people who own assets and have no debt have mostly been vaccinated. </p>
<p>Very few people will be able to resist this onslaught of financial and societal coercion. Thank God for the internet though, as more and more people are becoming aware of what's happening.</p>

        <p>Reminds me of what happened to Cuomo when they suspiciously trotted out all those sexual harassment/assault cases during MSM revelations of the nursing home deaths. </p>
<p>I suspect this is also the same, a conveniently manufactured distraction to draw attention away from the militarization of Canada's Covid-19 injection rollout. What better way to do it than a sex scandal, given the large number of reflexively authoritarian pussy worshipers in TV land?</p>

        <p>Oh, you mean the secret email that was released last year from an insider? Yeah, it‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs him. We need more people with an actual conscience to speak out with what‚Äôs about to be unleashed onto the public. Access to good reliable information is hard to come by, but it‚Äôs always great when we have an insider blowing the whistle of the shenanigans happening inside Parliament or Health Canada.</p>
