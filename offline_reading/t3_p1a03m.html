<title>Why is noone being more like Rand Paul? Why not take the antibody test, confirm you're immune, stop letting people bully you into the non-science way of taking vaccines you're immune for? Plus, if you're immune without any prior symptoms, you're probably better prepared for any new variant.</title>

        <p>Depends on the antibodies.  Yes, some of them eventually go away, which doesn't mean you're no longer protected, because, yes, the memory T-cells provide the longer-term immunity.</p>
<p>And this is precisely the problem: why is this angle not discussed anywhere?  Why have we not heard of the brand names for any antibody tests, as potential alternative to vaccination?  Why so few people understand the difference between PCR test and the antibody test?</p>

        <p>They don’t want anyone proving long term immunity, they want everyone to get the ineffective vaccine. Other diseases have tests that measure titers if antibodies and determine immunity, like Chickenpox, measles, mumps, Hepatitis B. If you are adequately protected, no vaccine typically required.</p>

        <p>Well, TBH, you can still make money from the antibody tests; they're also safer and proper blood draw isn't supposed to have any side effects.</p>
<p>But, yes, the control bits are the ones that are missing for sure; plus no fear factor in the antibody tests.</p>

        <p>Seriously, we've had this thing for 1.5 years now.  If you've ever been out since then, it's statistically improbable that you haven't come across someone who's infected with one strain or the other at one of the grocery stores at the very least.</p>
<p>Either it's not as infectious as they claim it is, or many more people get symptomless progression.</p>
<p>In any case, I think it's really stupid to take the vaccine without ever knowing your status first, because then you'll never have a clue whether or not you have any reason to worry about COVID19 in the future.  For example, if you test positive on a reliable antibody test, without ever having any symptoms or taking any vaccines, it possibly means that you won't get any symptoms from any new variant, either, and don't have to worry about getting the booster shots, either.  Compare this to the vaccine alternative, where even if you're vaccinated, you still have to wear masks, and still have to be afraid of the new variants, and still have to take it easy.</p>
<p>If you're not immune, whether or not you want to get vaccinated should be a personal choice, but I think it's really stupid how we suddenly forgot about seroprevalence in the population, and suddenly everyone has to get keep getting these booster shots every six months just to be part of the society.</p>
<p>The censorship on this topic is also ridiculous.  It's basically impossible to advocate for the science-first approach anymore; everyone just refers to Fraud Fauci's another "white lie" that everyone has to get vaccinated regardless of status.</p>

        <p>No, you take this one for yourself and to further science.</p>
<p>I mean, it's been over 1.5 years now. Chances are you're already immune if you've been out and about.</p>
<p>If you know you're immune, you know you have nothing to worry about.</p>

        <p>I flew to Brazil to see my family at peak pandemic haha. I’m pretty sure I’m immune but the last time I was sick was like 10 years ago.</p>
<p>But even so, I’m not going to get tested for any reason, not even the sake of science. I don’t really care if I have antibodies, it’s not going to change anything for me personally, and it’s clear that actual science is meaningless to TPTB.</p>

        <p>Part of my issue with it is, if they can’t isolate and identify Covid, then how can they isolate and identify the antibodies.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Just don’t trust them.</p>
<p>No clot shots!</p>
<p>No death jabs!</p>
<p>Period.</p>
