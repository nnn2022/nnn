        <p>Oh god. That is fucked up. Imagine being the person who thinks it’s fake, who the news told them it’s fake, suddenly realize that yes, the magnet does stick after all and they've been conned into it. </p>
<p>But at least... THIS experiment stopped when people felt uncomfortable!!! That’s not at all how we're all being treated as a society.</p>

        <p>This is particularly sick: "One lady even cried and told me that she did not want to be vaccinated but was forced to because her employer said she had to because she works in contact with customers."</p>

        <p>This is all completely unethical and unconsented to. People are not doing this because they agree to or want to. They’re being coerced, manipulated or forced into it. This is a crime against humanity and we need Justice to be served about this.</p>
