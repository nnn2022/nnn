    <strong>Any good towns in AZ that are against the new normal?</strong>
    <p><p>I was looking into some towns to move to, but I don't want one that would give into this new normal mush mouth shit. I want to be free and away from that. Any one know of any good ones? Thanks! ðŸ˜Š</p></p>

        <p>I went to AZ in September.  Flagstaff is hell, Prescott seemed okay.  There seemed to be a mix of rules regarding masks, never was clear on exactly what they were.  I think maybe places that served liquor were more stringent than say retail.  Saw several signs about freedom of choice.  Felt fairly normal for the most part.</p>

        <p>Thank you! Yeah, I kinda figured that towns with colleges such as Flagstaff would be a no go.</p>

        <p>Phoenix suburbs like Gilbert, Mesa, Queen creek have been exceedingly normal lately. Hell even my grocery store in central Phoenix doesnâ€™t give much of a shit about no masks. Itâ€™s not as bad as Flagstaff. Phoenix feels pretty chill lately.</p>

        <p>Doubt it would be the Phoenix of Tucson areas. Large cities, sure to be all in on the madness. Climate wise and aesthetically both towns are like where the will to live goes to die anyway. </p>
<p>I really like Williams but it's both very touristy and close to Flagstaff which is partly a college town so same probably goes for them too. All in on the progressive fascism.</p>
<p>Maybe Page but there's not much there. That's the other issue. Depending on if you're looking for work or things to do a lot of the towns area all by themselves dozens and dozens of miles from the next nearest little town. But maybe that's what you're looking for. God knows I would be if I could leave CA and could swing it financially. </p>
<p>Kingman, Holbrook, Prescott. I'm not sure who's left that is sane anymore.</p>
<p>Williams would be my go to pick under normal circumstances. Beautiful little town. Gateway to the Grand Canyon.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the info! I don't mind the small towns tbh. I just wanted to get away from the craziness that occurred in the cities, but I also wanted to be located in AZ as well.</p>
