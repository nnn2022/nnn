    <strong>COVID test</strong>
    <p><p>Background: I'm almost 30 weeks pregnant, and had to rush to the hospital last night due to some unforeseen circumstances in the pregnancy. While I was waiting in maternity's triage area, I had to have a COVID test done (potential for C-section level of circumstance). It was ultimately just uncomfortable for a few seconds, and I tested negative for it with the only side effect being a weird feeling nose for a few minutes. So here's my thing: would my level of care have changed at all had I gotten a positive result? I mean, if I had needed an emergency C-section, would they have been like, nah, good luck, here's your mask and you won't have human contact again for a bit? If baby had been born early, would they have let me go to the NICU to see her if I masked up and whatnot? I know they need to be aware to protect themselves and other patients, but I wish they'd've at least given a disclaimer that it wouldn't effect my level of care in any way. It just makes everything seem a bit more paranoid in regards to all of this, and made me feel a bit more nervous in an already difficult situation. Not complaining that I had to test, just getting that thought off my chest.</p></p>

        <p>I'm not against them knowing, other than nothing in my screening indicated that I would have COVID as I've not been exposed. I'm just also awake at an hour when I'm normally asleep, and my mind is wandering.</p>

        <p>It wouldn't have affected your level of care they have a duty of care to all patients. You would just be isolated from patients who didn't test positive. And your medical staff would have to wear extra protection. You'd probably need extra observation given pregnancy puts you at higher risk.</p>

        <p>Logically, I know that. I guess for me, having the disclaimer would have been nice. There's still a lot of fear and legal stuff around the virus where I'm at, but I'm also not going to sit in a room just me and my husband most of the day with a mask on.</p>

        <p>I'd be afraid to go back to a "doctor" like that. The way you described it, he sounds like the kind of person who'd just give you the jab pretending it was something else and then MAYBE tell you afterwards.</p>

        <p>I don't see that as being how they are at this hospital at all. I was just letting myself rant and ramble a little bit as the thought had crossed my mind and sleeping in a hospital is a struggle in and of itself, so I tend to dwell on it until I get it out of my system.</p>

        <p>In my country a small girl fell from a high place and was rushed to the ER.</p>
<p>The parents rusted to the hospital to see their daughter. They was told no entry without a negative test. They had to get out on the town yo get tested before they could see their kid.</p>

        <p>That's awful, and I can't imagine what they were going through with that. That was part of my concern if I had to deliver early - if I could see her in the NICU had the test gone differently. It's also allergy central for me with the pollens I'm allergic to, so I do have sneezing and some other allergy symptoms that are shared by COVID. I just assume that because I've not been around COVID-positive people, it's just the trees and grass.</p>
<p>I can only have one 'support person' with me right now, and he was screened when he brought me in, same as I was. He hasn't had to get the test, not that it was the worst thing I've had done this whole ordeal, but since I did and we live together, they probably assume his is also negative.</p>

        <p>Most importantly, good luck with your baby!  But don’t worry, your level of care wouldn’t be affected at all, they just take extra precautions if you tested positive.  Really, you have much more important things to be concerned about.</p>

        <p>There are no plus sides to taking a Covid test.   </p>
<p>If you are sick with respiratory issues, those are treated the same whether you have flu or positive covid.   The test makes no difference.</p>
<p>If you are not sick, a positive test can only complicate your life and make things difficult.   </p>
<p>If people just refused tests, this whole thing would be over.   It is the test numbers that are giving fuel to leftist governors to justify their crazy edicts.</p>
