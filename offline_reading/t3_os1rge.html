        <p>Gee, I wonder what you intended to imply by “mentioning” that! </p>
<p>Banning openly bigoted and anti-Semitic people isn’t a “new caste system.” I’m not sure when you hateful bigots decided that people who oppose the “new normal” were likely to welcome your anti-semitism, but you should fuck off with that hatemongering shit because it is NOT welcome.</p>

        <p>The post was in response to https://i.redd.it/ejsbksscpgd71.jpg where a reddit admin clarifies that hateful comments are allowed against whites &amp; men.  </p>
<p>It is not hateful to point out that reddit is owned by a jew. What is hateful &amp; racist is for reddit to allow hateful comments against whites &amp; men.  </p>
<p>But yeah, keep on calling people that oppose jewish racism, antisemitic. Jews can be racists too and we are not lesser beings not allowed to call them out on it when they are being racists.  </p>
<p>Whites deserve the same rights as jews, and anyone else.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this OP. This provides the last bit of evidence I need to make flyers and start causing trouble for these corporations. Imagine a mother realizing her children is being exposed to a company that officially promotes racism, thinks white people shouldn't have equal rights, and calls political opponents a disease vector to society. </p>

        <p>&rt; What is hateful &amp; racist is for reddit to allow hateful comments against whites &amp; men.</p>
<p>Fully agree. </p>
<p>Anyone who thinks that is wrong. However, it is just as racist to suggest that one’s identity as a Jew is relevant to what one thinks. </p>
<p>&rt; Jews can be racists too</p>
<p>What you mean to say, I hope, is that <strong>people</strong> can be racist. </p>
<p>Some of those racist people will be men, some will be women, some will be Christian, some will be Jewish, some will have dark skin and some will have light. In all cases, they are racist because of what they think and choose to do - not because of who they are. </p>
<p>A racist is a racist - whether he is Jewish or black or a transgender Muslim is irrelevant. One’s identity doesn’t make one racist or not racist, and therefore is irrelevant; if someone is a racist, you can and should criticize them for being a racist … making it about their identity as opposed to their beliefs and actions is completely unnecessary. </p>
<p>You’d understand that if you weren’t such a racist yourself.</p>

        <p>You're the one thats color blind (or at least pretends to be, we both know its a dog whistle) but whites don't have the privilege to be color blind.<br>
We are targetted by the jewish supremacist system that systemically discriminates against whites and that dilutes white nations with nonwhites.  </p>
<p>You're the racist here, because you intentionally supports the system that oppresses white people.  </p>
<p>Do you support equality and equity for white people?<br>
Do you think its okay to be white?<br>
Do you think whites deserve the same rights as other races?<br>
Do you think replacement migration is wrong?   </p>
<p>You're the racist here. I am standing up against jewish racism and getting my voice silenced by this jewish owned platform.<br>
Not only am I getting silenced for it, you're choosing to harass me further, while I am already lying down, beat.</p>

<p>Your questions, by the way, are insane. You might as well have asked, “do you support raping and murdering babies?” The fact that you feel the need to ask these questions of <em>anyone</em> suggests that very disturbing things are going on inside your head.</p>

        <p>Mentioning Jews, especially in regards to a corporation trying very hard to control the narrative and thinks racism against white people is okay, is not anti-Semitism. Just how brainwash do you have to be to think this way?</p>
<p>Haven't really cared about Israel or Jews but it makes me wonder why we're never supposed to mention Jews or question them. Why isn't that done for Kurds, Armenians, Native Americans, and numerous African tribes that are facing genocide?</p>
