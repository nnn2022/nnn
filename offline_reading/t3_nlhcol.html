    <strong>Whatever happened to people doing what is best for them?</strong>
    <p><p>Whatever happened to giving the people the choice to do what's good for them? Clearly there is such a divide between wearing a mask or not. Also there was people who were against vaccines before, however with the latest Covid one being released so quickly there seems to be a lot more people against vaccines now. Were the forced restrictions and lockdowns really necessary if at the end of the day they were going to let businesses decide what to do?</p>
<p>They could have let businesses figure out what to do instead of putting in things that caused them to shut down because they couldn't follow the restrictions. States are lifting mandates and restrictions across the USA yet people are still deciding for themselves whether to wear a mask, get vaccinated (unless you don't have the freedom because of job or family reasons), not wear a mask, not get vaccinated, wear two masks, etc. At the end of the day who would have been reliable if they sat back and let the people do whatever they wanted? Well simple the government would have taken a hit.</p>
<p>People would have questioned the government for not stepping in even though there were "guidelines". I think the CDC would have been better off if the states didn't use their "guidelines" to make it mandatory for people to follow them. I honestly think with this way you would have encountered roughly around the same number of deaths and cases. However, without any businesses forcing to close or downsize. There would have been less suicides and mental health issues. People would have been able to go get checked for other health concerns. Inflation wouldn't have got out of control. There could have been so many positive to just letting the people decide on what to do. Since at the end of the day people are doing that!</p>
<p>If this doesn't show that we were being controlled and manipulated by our state "leaders" by allowing us to decide on what's best for ourselves then I don't know what will.</p></p>
