    <strong>Even if the vaccine is safe and effective, Covid doesn't and has never justified the global lockdowns and this mass global vaccination operation.</strong>
    <p><p>This is the biggest thing for me that I have found strange from day one. This isn't the bubonic plague, this is a respiratory virus that can be devastating in a small percentage of the population, and very mild in the overwhelming majority of the population. Having the vaccine as the ONLY possible way to get back to normal life makes no sense and has never made any sense. This has been my biggest red flag with this whole timeline. Additionally, there were talks of mass vaccinating campaigns from the very beginning of this thing. Literally in March governments were bringing up this vaccine talk as our only salvation. The plan was laid right in front of us, and is all coming together. Ontario announced today that they will require vaccination cards to return to normal life. But again, the most important question needs to be addressed, if were looking at the data, is any of this necessary. Why do we need mass vaccination? Why is it our only solution.</p></p>

        <p>This. I had my parents die from this virus and it moderately sickened me when I had it.</p>
<p>I do not believe that the lockdowns, the masking, and the attempts to make this very new vaccine mandatory are reasonable in the real world.</p>
<p>We should be focusing on getting people better nutrition and blood tests to see if they are low on C, D, Zinc, etc. (the immune building vitamins and minerals) and get them supplements for those things they are low in.</p>

        <p>&rt;Wow, you are so brave to have lost your parents to this and Still not be hysterical about the flu.</p>
<p>I lost my father after he caught pheumonia back in August. He'd been suffering from ALS for 2 years. The doctors had predicted he had 2 more years to live after his got his diagnosis, so he died right on queue.</p>
<p>Still, it was a pneumonia that landed him in the hospital, where he would die after 1 or 2 days. Had he been tested positive for Covid-19, my father would be another one of those Covid-19 deaths. But he didn't.</p>
<p>Still, it is my father's death that helped me understand "dying with Covid-19" much better than most people. It made me understand how Covid-19 is typically just "the straw that breaks the camel's back", as Bhakdi describes it, when people die after catching it rather than the actual cause of death. Having seen my own father go through something very similar helps me see the bigger picture.</p>

        <p>I had 2 grandfathers die a few years ago. How did they die, you ask?</p>
<p>They both were in their 80s, caught a cold, and developed pneumonia. They died of a common respiratory infection.</p>
<p>No one cared. No one wore masks. No one cancelled Thanksgiving or Christmas.</p>
<p>Just imagine trying to explain to someone 10 years ago what we are doing right now. They would think it's some B movie on the Sci-Fi channel.</p>

        <p>Do not take my question(s) as insensitive or anything like that, I'm genuinely curious; did your parents suffer from any cardiovascular/respiratory issues or cancer?</p>
<p>Reported deaths for both heart disease &amp; cancer appear to be considerably lower than normal, with essentially the difference being roughly the total number of deaths attributed to covid-19.</p>

        <p>100% spot on exactly my thoughts. None of this was ever justified so how do we wind up with a final solution of forcing a nearly untested vaccine using new technology on the masses? Its fucked up. Someone's got something to gain or someone's got something to lose. Worse yet both.</p>

        <p>It was all propaganda from the start, initially they sowed fear of a new “mysterious” virus that caused people to spontaneously drop dead, then slowly the “breaking news” of a confirmed case in each country. Then because of this new “mystery plague” they issued states of emergencies and proceeded to lockdown. Then slowly things got stricter and stricter.</p>

        <p>Yeah it’s been bullshit. At first I remember people thinking/saying it had a six percent mortality rate which would be pretty high. Basically the western world freaked out because the CCP lied and recorded fake videos of people collapsing in public. Then we gradually realize the mortality rate isn’t high at all and doubled down.</p>

        <p>If it had a six percent mortality rate, it wouldn't spread that far and wide in the first place. That's virology 101: you can't have a virus that spreads a lot and kills a lot at the same time. There's of course counter examples but they're very rare and quite specific. AIDS, for example has like a 20 year incubation period in which you feel mostly fine.</p>

<p>Chinese language shops like Taobao &amp; Dark Web shops are probably the best places to look for anything that can be used to circumvent Western totalitarian measures.</p>

        <p>That's highly unlikely at least in the US for the airlines, domestically. My airline has already told the pilot group no vaccine requirement for aircrew, explicitly. </p>

<p>I doubt they'll make random passengers get it.....they want the seats filled. </p>

<p>Internationally, its possible for governments to make it a entry requirement. But I highly doubt the US airlines will themselves.</p>

They're insane people who run the world going after insane objectives. They want their Great Reset. They want their wealth transfer. They own everything and control almost everything. The fact that they're pushing for mass vaccination in itself means that something will not be right about the vaccine whatsoever.</p>

        <p>Yes, absolutely. For me this is one of the main things that proves without a doubt that all this is not really about viruses, but about many other things as well.</p>
<p>Even if all the official data is correct it's still bullshit. All of it. Starting from mask effectiveness, lockdown necessity, mandatory vaccination and ending with total restructuring of the whole society and economy only because of a flu-like illness.</p>

        <p>They, the mysterious 'they' are trying to kill us. Why would you take a vaccine that hasn't been tested? I believe the vaccine will either do terrible things to your body or will be addictive, like any drug, that you'll need and be required to take all the time and at higher and higher costs. Don't fall for it. Don't do it! Instead, fight and organize a rebellion to restore your God-given rights as a free human being. Remember there are more of us than there are of them.</p>

        <p>of course there is no evidence for any new virus or any new disease with unique symptoms.</p>
<p>BUT in regards to pandemic alone it would interesting for people to know, that the WHO deliberately changed their definition of pandemic to fit the agenda:</p>

        <p>ACTUALLY, viruses are extremely susceptible to mutation I.E. what is not deadly on a global scale could easily turn dangerous to any given person in the whole population so the slowing down of the spread does in fact slow down the rate/chance of mutation.

        <p>yes, covid19 is insidious in that it requires people that are not affected to make sacrifices for the people who are.</p>
<p>what you don't seam to realise is that the minority of people who can get sick at the same time is bigger than the number of doctors we have, and if all these doctors will be busy with older sickly people staying in ICUs for months then young people will start dieing because of car accidents, burst appendix or similar trivial matters that happen all the time.</p>
<p>yes, staying in what's essentially a house arrest for close to two years, loosing your business and going under sucks balls for everyone. letting thousands of people die sucks too. and although it's hard to see and admit (as with most cases when the responsibility for something is shared by everyone), you are picking between those two.</p>

        <p>what is and is not acceptable risk is your business as long as it does not affect the people around you.</p>
<p>if you choose never to leave your house because you are afraid to cross the road, it's your choice and it's ok. if you are into base-jumping, it's also ok.</p>
<p>for the choices that affect all of us we must compromise. it's probably not ok to give your president unlimited power for unlimited time in the name of the pandemic. it is probably ok require masks and to close down shops and bars once in a hundred years if that's realistically the only way to keep hosptals usable while we get through it.</p>
