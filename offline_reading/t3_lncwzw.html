    <strong>Why do people still need to wear masks even though they say if you get vaccinated the coronavirus will not attack you?</strong>
    <p><p>I saw a comment on this subreddit and decided to answer. First of all, a vaccine isn't some kind of magic potion which just stops the virus from entering you.</p>
<p>Secondly, vaccines raise our immunity so that it would be harder to spread. So, a mask would still be needed to further reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Also,some people don't obey all this nee normal so they just go wherever they want. And that's what the vaccine will help those people. </p>
<p>And then people would say that only 0.2% of population is dead,no big deal. Bruh,over 2 million people had died, what the hell you thinking? </p>
<p>"The coronavirus do no harm so everything is fine" , NO,  if it mutates into a more harmful disease,then more people will die. Where do you think this virus came from? Because it mutated thats why a bat virus can be transmitted to human.</p>
<p>Please just do your best to stop this virus spreading.</p></p>

        <p>Bruh do you really think we're waking up every day plotting to go out and cough on some old people and to keep this going?</p>
<p>Secondly, there is no difference between countries that locked down and didn't lock down in terms of how effective restrictions and mask mandates are. Explain Sweden to me, which hasn't properly locked down. Are swedes to blame for this?</p>
<p>Thirdly, and most importantly: The numbers. Are. Dropping. Infections are going down. To say that this will reverse itself once restrictions are lifted is like pretending to know next week's lottery numbers.</p>
<p>Fourthly: Coronaviruses mutate all the time. They've always done this. This is why the flu vaccine has to be adapted every year. Coronaviruses are prone to mutation, and they are almost infinitely more likely to mutate into a variant that is more contagious but less deadly. While a virus is not a living organism it tries to replicate itself as much as possible by hijacking cells. If it kills off its host it cannot replicate, which is why more contagious + less deadly is favourable. A virus is not a sentient thing that plans on eradicating the world. Above that, mutations are like flipping the arm of a slot machine. Whenever something replicates there is the chance of error, this goes for every cell, not just virus-infected ones. TLDR: The virus does like the virus do.</p>
<p>Fifth: Stop using statistics as argumentation. I'll bitch at anybody who says "Oh it's only 0.2%" just as if they were someone who says "wEaR a FuCkInG mAsK.". Absolute numbers do matter. But do you care about deaths related to obesity? Smoking? Alcohol? Heart Disease? Degenerative disorders? All factors that makes it a piece of piss for Covid to take someone out? No, you just care for the number. You just care for the statistic. All you want to see is how many people died of or with covid, but you'd never tell a fat person to work out, a smoker to stop smoking, an alcoholic to stop drinking or a dementia patient to stay hydrated so that they could increase their chances of surviving covid. You are not a saint, neither are you virtuous. NONE of us is. So stop talking as if you were better, because you're just as dirty of a pleb as the rest of us.</p>
<p>Yelling that the world is shit but not doing anything about it is the reason why it's so shit in the first place. This principle applies to everybody and is ignorant of whether you are for or against restrictions. Everybody can talk, everybody can accuse, but how many people actually DO?</p>

        <p>Yeah,everything you say is correct. We dont go out coughing on old people,that would be weird, but theres still chances of this virus spreading to them and we would need to stop that.</p>
<p>No,swedes arent to blame for</p>
<p>Yes,it doesnt depend on the restriction to lower it since its already spread to a lot of people. My country has a lot of people who doesnt obey the restrictions so the numbers go high and low unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Yeah,this virus is more about spreading and surviving, but again, we really don't wanna get sick and have viruses in our lungs.</p>
<p>Lastly,I do care about deaths of health problems but sadly, a lot of people ignore the threats of their health problems, some people don't care even if they know the effects. Thats why there's global effort in curing these habits or disease, like in education kids are taught the effects of all these problems from early age.</p>

        <p>People should do whatever they want as long as they’re not deliberately harming anyone else.</p>
<p>Edit: except for things like driving drunk, lighting fireworks in public areas etc. but that is NOT an analogy for “covid precautions”. Nobody should drive drunk and driving drunk has zero benefits. You can’t compare it to socializing like a normal human being.</p>

        <p>Your last point is actually hitting the nail on the head: People don't care even if they know the effects.</p>
<p>Like, wear a mask if it makes you feel safe. I couldn't care less. Do I think it makes you less of a person? No, you follow a different set of values. A set I disagree with, but that doesn't make you less human.</p>
<p>We know extremely little, yet pretend to know everything. Why are people taking mask mandates as gospel instead of starting to think about why medical experts are divided in two sides, one claiming that restrictions and masks work while the other claims they don't? Are these experts opposing restrictions/masks just hungry to see the world suffer? How do we come to the conclusion they are "misinformed", on what basis are we making that claim? On the claim that we believe that one side is right and one side is wrong.</p>
<p>And THAT, my friend, is religion, not science. Science is scrutiny, questions, trying to prove things wrong over and over again, and all new conclusions are subject to the same questions, scrutiny and attempts to prove it wrong. If you think you're following science by adhering to what you're told, well, you've been screwed.</p>
<p>A thing I learned over ten years ago: Always ask the question "Who profits?". That is the best question to ask if you want to start thinking outside the box. The world is not black and white. Only if someone says something it doesn't mean you're compelled to believe it. Only because many people believe something doesn't mean you're compelled to believe it too, unless you are afraid of being turned into an outcast. Believing that "spreading misinformation", as it's commonly called, "converts" people is just further ammo to fuel the theory that it's more about belief rather than rational thinking. Quite frankly, it's pretty patronising and arrogant to assume that others take everything at face value and therefore have to be "protected" from "misinformation"</p>
<p>Who profits from trying to convince people that the restrictions are a horrible mistake?</p>
<p>And once you have thought about that, think about the opposite: Who profits from trying to keep people in perpetual lockdowns?</p>
<p>And only then you will realise that we, in fact, know absolutely fuck all and that this entire shitshow is the perfect breeding ground to confuse and divide people.</p>

        <p>I think everybody wants a normal life, and we're not talking "the new normal", which contains infringements on privacy, potential harassment or straight-up discrimination of sceptics (as is currently happening in Israel where they've started adopting vaccine passports that allow you into places like supermarkets, etc.), we want the old normal.</p>
<p>We don't want people to die of the virus. At the same time we don't want people to kill themselves because of feelings of hopelessness. Depression is running rampant. Unemployment numbers are soaring. We're trying to fight a headache by repeatedly punching ourselves in the stomach. Yeah, it distracts from the headache but we're still in pain, and for many it's much worse.</p>
<p>We're in a fubar situation. Whatever way you put it, people will die. The way out is not "more restrictions", because the last year has clearly shown us that infection rates were out of control despite lockdowns, and to pull up the Sweden example, less restrictions did not result in more infections or deaths.</p>
<p>Once we've come to the conclusion that something HAS to change, and has to change quickly then we're on the same page and we can work from there. And quite frankly, I couldn't give a toss if someone wants to wear a mask or wants to stay indoors for the rest of their lives. I know for sure I don't, and that's coming from someone who had a WFH job for years before the pandemic and who hated socialising. Hell, introverts opposing a state they'd usually like to have, if that's not alarming I don't know what is.</p>
<p>All of this madness for a very contagious but comparatively harmless (for people without underlying conditions) coronavirus? Locking up the healthy to protect the unhealthy, and killing both in the process?</p>
<p>Again, believe what you will, that's your choice. Ask questions. Don't ponder about whether it's the right question to ask or not. There are no dumb questions.</p>

        <p>I have a serious question I'd like to ask you:</p>
<p>With governments and health officials repeatedly saying that the vaccine will not mean that people can go back to normal, and that restrictions will have to stay in place until most or all people have had their jab, and hinting towards that people will have to get this jab in regular intervals for the foreseeable future but at the same time we see vaccine shortages in many places, do you really think this will be the way out?</p>
<p>In other words: Something that is scarce, that is said to be needed by everybody, and said to be renewed every half year or so, is the way... "out"?</p>
<p>Are we really sure we know what's going on here?</p>

        <p>You're absolutely right - There is no definite answer.</p>
<p>All we have is signs and hints brought across via media. We don't know if the vaccine will be the solution. We don't know if perpetual lockdowns are the solution. Or vaccine passports. Or travel restrictions. In my perception it is crushingly obvious that none of these things will bring us back to a state of normality.</p>
<p>Technological, pharmaceutical and scientific progress is great, but not on the prescription of manufactured terror about a <em>very</em> survivable virus or on the prescription of skipping long-term trials and saying that someone whose name I've never heard before, who is labelled an expert said "It's safe.". Experts can be wrong. We've seen this time and time again. Being sceptical or at least keeping a somewhat open mind is a good trait to have.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for not immediately dismissing a conversation. People like you are quite rare. We don't necessarily agree on each other's viewpoints but at least I could give you an insight in mine and you could give me an insight in yours. Like I said, keep asking questions and when facing something that can't be unequivocally proven right or wrong, don't dismiss viewpoints based on anecdotes. This is not "pro vs. con". This is "How the fuck did we end up here and how can we stop blaming each other and find a solution?"</p>

I think it's safest to say that "not accepting the new normal" is our smallest common denominator and beyond that people have their own beliefs, ranging from people who think that Covid isn't real (Which I can understand when trying to look at things from their viewpoint, but it doesn't mean that I subscribe to that) to people who actually will get the vaccine.</p>
<p>It's important to stay vigilant and to not buy into anything that someone wants you to buy into (Be it pro or con) and rather take into consideration what is said and then think about what you can take away from it to form your own opinion, which is, admittedly, quite tough considering how we're bombarded with gazillions of differing opinions every day. What even is real anymore?</p>

        <p>The entire point of the vaccine is to cause your cells to produce proteins that your immune system recognizes and attacks as a foreign body, in other words it causes an autoimmune response when these proteins are displayed on the outside of the host cells. Better hope that none of the vaccine gets into your muscle cells or nerve cells because those don't grow back if they are completely destroyed.</p>

        <p>At the 15 minute mark he stated that all types of cells can absorb the lipid nanoparticles of the vaccine. Then five minutes later he paused the video to overlay a text box that said the host cells are not destroyed at the time of vaccination, but he never explained why that is. At the 25 minute mark he paused his explanation of the Astro-Zeneca vaccine and put up the exact same text box with no reasons given for his assertion. </p>
<p>In the comment section a few people tried to explain that the reason is that the immune response is not immediate and takes some time to develop. Now if that explanation is correct, I would ask the question of what happens at the time of second dose, or what happens of the person receiving the vaccine has already been exposed to the wild virus.</p>

        <p>The host cells are not destroyed at the time of vaccination because its a mRNA, it just goes into the cell,bind to the ribosomes, make proteins which then goes to the APCs then make the B cells become plasma cells which produces antibodies to neutralise the virus. The mRNA can't destroy the host cell since it literally doesnt destroy cells, its just a strand of data.</p>
<p>If the antibodies are still active,then the virus will be neutralised. If not,then the person got covid.</p>

        <p>Obviously the mRNA doesn't hurt the host cells, what I am referring to is when the white blood cells recognize a foreign protein sitting on the MHC-1 receptors of the host cell membrane. Are we supposed to believe that the immune system will recognize the proteins as foreign and develop antibodies and yet somehow they will ignore the host cells and pretend they aren't flying the flag of an invading enemy?</p>

        <p>Yes, our B cells and plasma cells are capable of recognising the cells so they don't randomly kill off cells, (except if you're born with a disorder or something). They just work as they are programmed.</p>
<p>Edit: its not that "somehow" it will ignore the host cell. When the antibodies are produced,then they will keep finding those virus peptides and checking ALL CELLS INCLUDING THE HOST CELL . If the host cell got the virus,it dies, if the host cell don't have the virus, its good. Thats just how it works. If those WBC can't even do such a simple job, then our immune system is a failure.</p>

        <p>There is no difference in the limited "brain" of a T killer cell between a self cell that is infected with a virus and a self cell that is healthy but is showing the distress sign of being infected, i.e. a foreign protein in the MHC receptor. Both are treated the same way and that is by being destroyed as collateral damage in the war against an invading pathogen. </p>
<p>The reason that mRNA vaccine immunity is effective is that it really does make your immune system think you have a virus, much to the detriment of host cells that are producing the proteins. Better hope that none of the cells that do that are ones you can't replace, would be a shame to have a patch of your deltoid that no longer functions, or if the nanoparticles somehow make it deeper into your body and effect other tissues. Of course no data has or will ever exist to prove that the vaccine lipid particles stay in your arm near the point of injection.</p>

        <p>Because neither a facemask nor a vaccine works. When something works it works for the user.</p>
<p>And vaccine drugs are secret serums monopolized by a pharma-gov cartel. They cannot be independently analyzed, cannot be independently tested, cannot be independently verified, cannot be traded in the open market.</p>

        <p>Facemasks and vaccines actually do work. But in theory, irl we would accidentally touch our masks,thus rendering it ineffective. Vaccine is just some weakened microbes (also i saw on TV there're RNA and other stuff) ,not a secret serum.</p>
<p>Now about the pharma-gov cartel. Ok,so yes they just used as much resource as possible to make a vaccine. And monopolize? No, they can't since there're so many institutions out there making vaccines. The government do help them out so they could become a "hero" in saving this pandemic.</p>
<p>Lastly, the vaccine can't be traded in open market because we dont know what people would do with the vaccine. And some people don't know the proper way to use it. Some people might even abuse it and etc.</p>

        <p>How do you know anything about vaccines? No independent access is possible. So how do you know? Are a vaccine manufacturer associate or you are a pharma-believer? And yes they monopolize it 100%. Something that is not monopolized is available to trade openly . I cannot buy these vaccines in the open market. Not the covid one, none. Since 1906 there is no free medical market.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; we dont know what people would do with the vaccine.  </p>
<p>Who's "we"?  Do you know how to prove if someone is immune or not to a pathogen?</p>
<p>There are many things in the open market people don't know how to use. I for one don't know how to use most things in the open market. So I read the instructions from the manufacturer or I ask the vendor. Or I learn how to trade items in the open market.  As of abuse people can abuse everything. So these excuses your brought up have no base.</p>
<p>Facemasks detriment physical performance. And cause damage to the environment. In fact they are worse than smoking cigarettes. Using a specialized mask for performing a task for a short time, is one thing. Making it part of a lifestyle is certainly damaging to me at least.</p>
<p>And what's worse is that both facemasks and vaccines are mandated.</p>

        <p>Most viruses mutate to become less deadly and more contagious. That will likely happen with this virus and this along with herd immunity will end the pandemic like the 1918 one. The masks and social distancing only delay it. The original purpose of flattening the curve was to expand out the Covid deaths over time. The same amount of people have died from Covid over time instead of during one period.</p>
