    <strong>Get Vaccine Or Lose Job.</strong>
    <p><p>I constantly see people post on here that their employer is giving the option of getting vaccinated or face termination.</p>
<p>I then see people posting “well I’d just quit or get fired! I’m not getting vaccinated!”</p>
<p>My question to those who have this reply is what do you do for a living? My wife is now faced with this very option and I doubt she’s going to find other work in her field that won’t if not already require it. She also has a medical diagnosis that I believe if she quit would be a train wreck trying to get insurance as well.</p>
<p>Backing people into a corner to take a emergency use vaccine or face losing their job and everything they’ve worked for is absolutely disgusting can’t believe this is where we are in this country.</p></p>

        <p>People of Christian faith should take note of what's happening to these people:</p>
<p>This is how easy it is for tyrannical governments to force you to do something that goes against everything you believe in. Financial/economic ruin is a powerful motivator. Bow down to the golden statue or else. </p>
<p>Very few people stay true to their convictions under this kind of pressure.</p>

        <p>I keep praying for God to give me the strength to resist and  keep pushing forward. I'm not getting this vaccine. It's better to lose everything in this world if it means i get to keep my soul.</p>

        <p>"Never before has the land of Zion appeared so vulnerable to so powerful an enemy as the Americas do at present. And our vulnerability is directly attributable to our loss of active faith in the God of this land, who has decreed that we must worship Him or be swept off. Too many Americans have lost sight of the truth that God is our source of freedom﻿—the Lawgiver﻿—and that personal righteousness is the most important essential to preserving our freedom. So, I say with all the energy of my soul that unless we as citizens of this nation forsake our sins, political and otherwise, and return to the fundamental principles of Christianity and of constitutional government, we will lose our political liberties, our free institutions, and will stand in jeopardy before God."
-Ezra Taft Benson, <em>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</em>, 1979</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear you and your wife are in that situation.</p>
<p>I'm in the same boat with my job (health insurance). I figure the whole industry is compromised by now. Trying to do that tightrope walk of staying at my job as long as possible (great pay, adding to my savings), and jumping ship for any job, in any industry, that won't mandate the clot shot.
I'm willing to throw my whole career away if that's what it takes.</p>
<p>I hope your wife finds something else that works for her.</p>

        <p>My wifes a icu nurse and theres talk the hospital is going to force it so we are looking at other options like small town Heath clinics instead of a big hospital this ones supposedly catholic i don't see this as being a good catholic organization, i work in a factory and we are so short staffed i dont see them making it mandatory here this place would close down plus 80% of all the employees here are vaxed so if you work for a big corporation it might be time to look else where if you are not wanted to comply,its really said that its getting to the point where we can't make our of judgment of what we do for our selves its not up to our employer to make that decision for us this is illegal and gose against our human rights this has to stop</p>

        <p>OP - I don't have an easy answer to this. I don't know that one exists. I do think that at a minimum though, every employee that faces this should give their employer this "form to employer requiring experimental vaccines". If everyone faced with this circumstance that opposes mandatory vaccines does so, it would be an incredibly valuable contribution to the resistance. https://americasfrontlinedoctors.org/legal/vaccines-the-law/</p>

        <p>I used to be a truck driver for a small yogurt company. If they hadn't been shut down because of the restrictions you better believe I would have quit if they mandated the vaccine. I was due for a significant raise if our contract wasn't cancelled too but I still would have quit. </p>
<p>They wanted me to wear a mask and I refused, didn't fire me because I was indispensable. My integrity is NOT negotiable, neither is my bodily autonomy. Fear is the establishment's greatest weapon. I'm not afraid that's why everything eventually works out for me. It's not an easy path but it's far easier than the path of unknown side effects that are more than likely permanent. You can always find another job, can't get another body though......</p>

        <p>&rt; what do you do for a living?</p>
<p>Nothing, i quit my job last spring when they started pushing the masks. But i can see where having bills and debt would make the decision extremely hard.</p>
<p>My buddy currently has the same decision to make. If he didn’t have kids he would probably quit too.  Shitty bully tactics</p>

        <p>They backed you into the corner, so don't pay off your debts. Simple! The central banks are currently stealing absolutely everything anyway, so why even bother paying them. Not worth it.</p>

        <p>I'm about to go through this. I'm supposed to be vaccinated or have an approved exemption by Friday. So far I've done nothing. I've said nothing about my status and am ignoring auto update emails telling me I'm not compliant. I work in communications as a writer and editor. </p>
<p>I won't do anything unless someone emails me directly about tasks I need to keep my employment. At which point I'll let them know that I'm opting out of the policy and will have proof that they are trying to force my choice. I will call their bluff. Employers need competent workers, but half the population is unvaccinated, and many of the ones who are have no interest in working. </p>
<p>Another comment included the America's Frontline Doctors link, which I also plan to use when it's time. I don't think they will accept full liability in case of injury, so I'm hopeful. But we'll see.</p>

        <p>I'm a software-developer and a minimalist. So I have quite some savings. I could also try to get employed somewhere where I can work remote from home.</p>
<p>I mean I could even try to self-employ. I was able to make a proof-of-concept of a computer-game within 10 days in my free-time without prior knowledge about Unity. So I guess if I actually put in some effort, I could make something that's decent.</p>
<p>I also have friends who have lived on welfare. Not luxurious and having to turn every cent but the got by.</p>
<p>So even if I don't do anything, spend all my savings over time I think I could get by.</p>
<p>There is a mindset that, at least for me, takes away the fear from that quite easily:</p>
<p>Animals also manage to survive. So why should I, as a member of the most intelligent species, who can easily learn anything I need within a short period of time, be afraid of that?</p>
<p>I could get a book about edible wild-plants and then survive foraging in the forest. (but winter could prove problematic)</p>
<p>The only thing I'm actually afraid of is other humans.</p>
