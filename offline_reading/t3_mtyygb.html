        <p>The thing is that to the enthusiasts for lock-downs, masks, and distancing, it HAS to be about airborne particles because the restrictive measures are customized for them... or maybe better put, the aerosolized particle narrative is scripted for the purpose of instituting restrictions and dictating behavior.</p>
<p>The purpose of the pandemic is to create demand for dictatorship on the misguided notion that it will protect us... and it's not really about pushing the drugs as it is about desensitizing us to not having the ability to come and go as we please.  A year has gone by and a good number seem acclimated to this new way of life-- a new normal.</p>
<p>Freedom has become a government purview and not an innate human right.</p>

        <p>i agree that the “perpetually suspect everyone around you of lethal contagion” is mainly a  justification for lockdown and state-driven population control. i also think big pharma is a key component of this ploy, and the production and mass injecting of the global population is critical to the plot of usurping of freedom/civil liberties.</p>

        <p>The vaccination aspect could be viewed through the lens of subscription:</p>
<p>Taking the shot will afford the individual a limited span and scope of "freedom" as defined by government "public health experts".  Once the subscription expires (effectiveness wears off) the individual reverts to the default lockdown state of being until the injection-subscription is renewed.</p>

        <p>"If viruses cannot reproduce and only come from infected cells, how did the first virus-producing cells get infected?"</p>
<p>That's the question I started asking myself recently.</p>

        <p>Someone doesn't understand how viruses work. Viruses cannot reproduce without INFILTRATING cells. That is why they turn your own cells into viral reproduction factories and intentionally made your cells go "KERSPLODE!" in order to shed viral material into your system, making you breathe and excrete it out.</p>
<p>Then, because of your breathing it out and excreting it, it spread to other people as they inhale it or transfer it into their bodies in other fashions.</p>

        <p>How does that answer the question where viruses originally came from?</p>
<p>How do you think they came into existence, before the first infected cell allowed them to reproduce?</p>
<p>What existed first: The virus or a virus-producing cell?</p>

        <p>I was just wondering that ... If people or science say this is novel, then they are trying to mean this has “broken” some animal-human barrier. But it existed in animals. So ideally those bats excreted the virus, which a human came in contact with, or ate fruit, which was then consumed by a human. And they want us to believe that since millions of years, no human has ever come in contact with such incidence of faeces or fruit? That it is airborne only now? </p>
<p>That makes it ‘novel’? Or is it novel for bats too. Hence no human came in contact? That’s why we don’t have any prior immune exposure?</p>

        <p>Last year some slaughter-houses in Germany were closed because like 80% of the people working there were tested positive.</p>
<p>Almost all of them symptom-free. The percentage of people with positive tests not working there but living in the same city was like everywhere else.</p>
<p>Explaining this without questioning the propagated premises or getting caught up in contradictions seemed almost impossible.</p>
<p>They chose the contradictions though.</p>

        <p>Fair point - this demo, and the subset within it allergic to various forms of exogenous insulin, depend on pharmaceuticals to survive. </p>
<p>While I do speak generally in this post, I should state here that these exceptions do exist and that I’m not opposed to certain drugs being deployed in a variety of exceptional, ad hoc or emergency situations. I believe the benefits of medical technology (including some pharmaceuticals) are absolutely a great boon to humanity, to be clear. I’m referencing the kinds of pharmaceuticals not necessary to good health (the vast majority of which are actively detrimental) and that are churned out year after year to only benefit manufacturers and their investors.</p>

        <p>it’s not a lie. most people can be healthy without pharmaceuticals being a core part of their lives. there are exceptions. as i explained in my first reply to you. most people understand that this post is written within the context of the discourse on Covid-19 and the experimental gene therapy jabs. you’re being intentionally nit picky and obtuse. </p>
<p>seriously, fuck off 🤣. you’re just being annoying at this point. none of what you’re saying detracts from the core message of the post which you’ve apparently failed to comprehend. i’ll forgive you if you’re on the spectrum, though.</p>

        <p>My mom is T1D and it was surprising because she is a very fit healthy person, takes very good care of herself but she got it out of nowhere in her early 50s. Even though diabetes is dangerous and a lot to manage I was able to feel some comfort in the fact that it’s not a disease you treat w crazy compounds, you’re really just supplementing something you’re body’s unable to make. They started out just using the stuff from cows, nature made! They’ve tinkered with it a lot of course to make it work better, which is great.</p>

        <p>Get this trash off of this subreddit. All it does is give ammo to doomers to paint us all as lunatic conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>The germ theory of disease is about as proven as the theory of gravity: miasma and terrain theory are absolutely debunked and flat outwrong. Germs cause disease. Germs spread disease. That individual health, immune system health, gut bacteria, etc... all factor in the severity of disease is consistent with germ theory, as all those factors play into how well your body can fight off pathogenic germs (while having symbiotic or at least non-harmful relationships with nonpathogenic germs).</p>

        <p>From your "well documented article"</p>
<p>1) Claim: Viruses have never been isolated from pure cell cultures or human cells.</p>
<p><a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/microbiology/chapter/isolation-culture-and-identification-of-viruses/">Here's a website</a> going over the process of virus isolation, culture, and identification.</p>
<p>2) Claim: Bacteria cannot be controlled for as the sole cause of food poisoning as bacteria is ubiquitous in the human gut</p>
<p><a href="https://badgut.org/information-centre/a-z-digestive-topics/bacteria-and-foodborne-illness/">General info about food poisoning</a>. Main take - food poisoning typically occurs with raw, undercooked, or spoiled foods, as harmful bacteria that causes it is found in larger quantities on those foods. Your source ignores that some germs are pathogenic and others are not, as well as that the number of pathogens and immune system of the individual both are important factors on sickness.</p>
<p>3) Claim: Amount of people that die from food poisoning every year are wild guesses</p>
<p>Doesn't have anything to do with germ theory</p>
<p>4) Claim: Bacteria don't cause disease, they cure disease, as bacteria have been used to treat cancerous tumors.</p>
<p>Again, this ignores that some germs are pathogenic and others are not, and that the number of pathogens is a main variable of disease. The study it discusses uses modified salmonella that only attacked cancerous cells. Nuance: that not all bacteria are pathogenic does not negate germ theory.</p>
<p>5) Claim: That bacteria exist symbiotically with us, that asymptomatic individuals disprove germ theory, and that Koch abandoned his original postulates after discovering viruses all disprove germ theory.</p>
<p>Again, not all bacteria are pathogenic. The amount of pathogens and the strength of individual immune systems explain asymptomatic vs symptomatic individuals. That Koch abandoned his postulates was just that they aren't 100% true, although still useful as guidelines.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch%27s_postulates">Koch's postulates</a>, with the summary, "an infectious agent can be considered to be a sufficient cause for a disease if it satisfies Koch's postulates. Failing that, the postulates suggest that the infectious agent is a necessary, but insufficient, cause for a disease."</p>
<p>6) Claim: Bacteria cannot be good in small amounts and harmful in large amounts, and germ theorists cannot pinpoint the exact transition line.</p>
<p>Again, again, not all bacteria are pathogenic, and the amount of pathogens and the strength of individual immune systems are important factors for disease. There is no hard cut-off, but general trends and observation.</p>
<p>7) Claim: Bacteria are not invaders, are a product of the body's prima materia, and are the primary agents the body uses to break down a toxin. Bacteria is everywhere, therefore it cannot invade a human body.</p>
<p>Again, again, again, not all bacteria are pathogenic, and the amount of pathogens and the strength of individual immune systems are important factors for disease. I'm going to have to start copy and pasting this instead of typing it out each time! The claim bacteria are a product of they body's prima materia is just false.</p>
<p>8) Claim: The human microbiome (Bechamp's microzymas )are the fundamental element of biological life, and when it becomes morbid is the starting point of disease.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_B%C3%A9champ">Bechamp</a> was wrong. Just a general page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_denialism">Germ theory denialism</a> to maybe help springboard to other sources. Again, this is disproven by over a century of science finding that germs cause and spread disease. For extreme modern examples, look to rabies and ebola.</p>
<p>9) Claim: Viruses have not been observed penetrating a cell, and cannot exist outside a host cell, and cannot be alive without a cell so how can it penetrate a host cell in the first place?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus#Life_properties">Whether viruses are "alive" depends on your definition of life.</a> They do exist outside of host cells, and do not need to be alive to infect a host cell, the same way an acid doesn't need to be alive to cause chemical burns when it affects your skin cells.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't have time to go through all of these, I need to get to work But basically, not all germs are pathogenic and the number and severity of the pathogens, as well as they body's immune system, are important factors in disease. Rejecting the germ theory of disease dismisses the incredible leaps of medical technology in the past few centuries, including vaccines, general hygiene practices, antibiotics, disease treatment, and PPE. This is all well within, and explained by, germ theory.</p>
