    <strong>Pro-lockdown people can’t tolerate people with different lifestyles.</strong>
    <p><p>I have many interests but one of them is old vehicles and old military vehicles. I have many of them and my collection is steadily growing. I’m a 25 year old woman, most people into this are usually kinda dorky teenage boys and older men. </p>
<p>I have another Reddit account I use often and I tell people about my hobbies and discuss them. I get into discussions where I tell people about my collection and all that and people say “you’re making this up, this isn’t real.” A lot of those people are pro-lockdown. It might seem like a weird coincidence but I think it’s common theme with these people. They think they’re normal and sane but can’t comprehend the fact that people have more expensive and different interests. I was talking to someone about how I’m trying to acquire a WW2 tank or half track and someone told me it was “the most made up thing they’ve seen on Reddit.” I know tank owners. I know people who own these sorts of things. It may seem crazy but these people don’t like “crazy.” </p>
<p>These people want everyone to be the same. They can’t handle the fact that not everyone is like them. They want everyone to wear a mask, stay home, six feet apart. They don’t like “crazy” or anything like that. These people’s “normal” hobbies may be hiking, Netflix, stuff like that but my “normal” is old Jeeps and cars. To me it seems like a form of jealousy. I can afford these things. I’m doing a lot better than most people my age. They’re jealous I can afford nice things and they say I’m lying as a way to cope. It’s like that with covid. Oh, you’re not scared of the virus and live your life as normal? You’re a covid denier. </p>
<p>This probably doesn’t make sense but I hope you can kind of see what I’m talking about. Long story short the people who like lockdowns can’t tolerate different hobbies/etc and say that whoever talks about it is faking it. I’m sure these people are like this with lots of other things too. I really don’t know how to describe this.</p></p>

        <p>I've seen a lot of lockdowners say, "Why are you depressed? Get a hobby." As if a ton of hobbies aren't made completely impossible by all these restrictions. I know people who planned their free time around music festivals, Pride events, travel, theater... Hell I'm practically a shut-in already and one of my favorite hobbies (snail mail/card swapping) has been all but stopped. Half my penpals live in a country that has banned international mail. </p>
<p>A few more people have said, "Perfect time to get outside! Go hiking/camping!" Cool. I live in a city and don't own a car. A hobby that's great for them might not work for someone else. </p>
<p>And for a lot more people, the only hobbies that matter are Netflix and video games.</p>

        <p>Im a huge fest head. I go to a couple a year. This year broke my 5 straight years of going to Lollapalooza. And the indefinite idea of "who knows when ill see a concert again" is making me insane. I will not be able to live another summer like this.</p>

        <p>Damn, what country closed international mail? That’s a bit excessive. But yeah, it’s easy for these people to say “get a hobby” when they themselves don’t do anything all day. I like video games but I play for a few hours a day and have time for other stuff. I couldn’t imagine that being the only thing I do.</p>

        <p>I haven't been able to send anything to my friends in South Africa since March. Luckily we mostly talk online since their postal service has always been spotty. </p>
<p>I waited over a month for a package from Germany when European mail usually only takes a week or two. But I know there's some political mess affecting the postal service here in the US that just adds to the delay.</p>

        <p>I know what mean. I don’t know anything about your hobby, but it’s your hobby. As someone who likes hiking, trust me while it’s more mainstream the doomers hate when people want to go outside and stay healthy. I feel like I experience this on a more mainstream level when I complain about missing exercise classes and doomers tell me to walk up the stairs and carry something. I’m glad you enjoy owning tanks even though that’s not my thing.</p>

        <p>100% true. They're totally fine watching TV because that's the only thrill they want but they cant take seeing someone get a beer at a bar that they have never been to. </p>
<p>This happened to me recently and pissed me off: 
We don't wear masks at my job in a state where we have a mask mandate. We don't deal with customers face to face and we have a small staff so we all agreed it was fine. We just hired this man who is about 60. My boss told him about our masks and he said he feels uncomfortable. So we have to wear them when he's in the store now. </p>
<p>Im very nice imo and i was giving him the benifit of the doubt like he just need this little bit of money to make ends meet and he dosnt want to be here be he has to shit like that. 
I find out 2 days ago he got this part time job FOR FUN. He said he got it so he could get out of his house and stop feeling so cooped up. But he MAKES up wear out mask for him when he dosnt have to be there and is working FOR FUN. 
Fuck this guy. He can get out of his house and get a whole job to "have fun" but no one else is allowed to do what they want to do. I'm appalled every day by these fucking people</p>

        <p>I remember being honestly surprised just how much...disdain(? maybe that’s too harsh) or awkwardness I was treated with in expressing my dissatisfaction with online gatherings, closures, etc. I just didn’t understand how so many friends of mine could be happy living such blah lives of going hiking, watching TV and interacting only with people in their house or their “bubble.” And Instill don’t. Don’t they want to have life experiences? Travel again? Do things besides post virtue signaling on Facebook while they sit on the couch again? They don’t want to try new restaurants and experience the atmosphere of sitting in and enjoying the meal? </p>
<p>I didn’t even like hiking or camping before the pandemic. Why would I do it now? Just because it’s cool for everyone and their dog to go now? And what will these people in PA do in a few months when the weather cools off? You won’t be outdoor dining and camping in late October. So are you going to lock yourself back in the house again? </p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I’m the only one who wants my full life back. I feel out of place with everyone who seems happy to wear masks, have limited activities and relax at home. And they all seem to applaud the drive-in concerts and comedy shows and online raffles. I don’t mind a raffle but doing it all online is not as good as having an event with good appetizers and cocktails and socializing while you check out the items.</p>

        <p>My in laws are looking at a ranch property a state away and my husband and I went with them. It’s so nice to get out of the house. We went to a Texas Roadhouse for dinner and we had to eat outside but it was nice and warm. We’re in a state with no mask mandate and we’re gonna go sit down in the hotel hot tub. It’s been nice even though we’ve just been driving today.</p>

        <p>It’s not just hobbies. These extreme pro lockdown people cannot handle any type or difference of opinion and refuse to simply let other people be themselves. They are fascists at the core. </p>
<p>I had one such “friend” whose true colors were revealed when the lock down began. She went as far as trying to tell me what I could and could not speak about and what language I was allowed to use to discuss certain topics. She was perpetually offended by any slight difference of opinion. Bizarrely, she is a high school English teacher but I cannot fathom how someone so controlling and close minded could even manage to exist in this world, let alone in NYC where she lives and was raised.</p>

        <p>What's so hard to believe about owning a tank? I imagine there could be some legal issues, but that doesn't make it a violation of the fucking laws of physics. And yeah, I suppose it could be an expensive hobby, but if people are in denial because they're poor and jealous, who do they think DOES have the money they lack? Well, maybe a young woman in the market for a tank! :D</p>
<p>Psst! I'm also a woman roughly your age, quite jealous and 100% supportive of your hobby, so it isn't just old men or teenage boys! Also can you maybe throw like a ~~fighter jet~~ helicopter my way?</p>

        <p>This stems from the notion of equality which any sane person knows can’t exist based on the different needs and advancement of some people vs others. This is a big thing for me as whenever someone tries to hit me with that shit that “we are all equal.” No. No we’re not. Some people own tanks because they have the interest and funds to support it.</p>

        <p>I theorize that a big problem is that people tend to overgeneralize everything.  And I realize that is an overgeneralization.</p>
<p>But a large number of people seem to think that if they believe something, or do something, or like something, that is the norm.  And when they do accept that there exists a differing attitude, it become an Us and Them situation a strict dichotomy of thought.  No room for nuance or spectrum.</p>
<p>I was taken to task on a hobbyist subreddit not long ago for not supporting some Youtuber being on some movie franchise neither of which I had heard of.   It was simply inconceivable to people that I do not watch Youtube and had not heard of the movies.</p>
