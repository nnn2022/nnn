    <strong>Can anyone help me out here?</strong>
    <p><p>So my work has been pretty chill with everything up until this morning when my service manager walked up to me and said starting in a week or two I’ll have to wear my mask 100% of the time I’m at work. This includes me being outside by myself as well. I do not intend to comply with this; I’m curious if I were to be fired over refusal to wear a mask would I be eligible for unemployment? Or would that count as a forfeiture of benefits? I have a 4 month old son, I would love nothing more than to be paid to stay home with him for a bit while I find my next job, but I’m worried I wouldn’t receive benefits. Any lawyers or anyone knowledgeable on this topic please offer advice. Thank you in advance:)</p></p>

        <p>Whether you're approved or not depends largely on a report from your employer (mine lied and said I quit without notice when I was fired while off the clock and I was denied), so I suggest just talking to your boss about it. Say you're not going to be able to comply, and you understand if they have to fire you, but given that you're a parent could they please make sure to approve unemployment. If they're a decent human you should be good. Get a medical exemption in advance and you'll surely be approved and possibly able to sue. </p>
<p>Don't forget you pay into your unemployment, so it's your money.</p>

        <p>Thank you very much for the reply. I’m sorry to hear that your employer did that to you, that’s so scummy:/ 
If I pay into it and I’ve only been here 9 months, does that mean I have a certain limit to how much unemployment I could receive in total?</p>

        <p>Not a problem! Tbh I'm not at all reliable about the intricacies of that aspect, so you're probably better off going to the applicable website for your area. There's probably a calculator chart to figure out your benefits by inputting your pay and whatnot. Sorry I can't help more. It's insane that this is even happening to you... Have you tried just starting with explaining the rights afforded to you by the ADA? It says that people can't ask for proof of a medical condition, and can't treat you differently for having said condition, in laymen's terms. </p>
<p>Just like cops do, all aspects of the establishment take full advantage of people being unaware of their rights as well as the shield of legal precedent behind which we can hide from tyranny.</p>

        <p>I didn’t think we would be going back down this route it’s only me and another guy who aren’t vaccinated out of 17 employees. If you want, I’m sure tomorrow they’ll go over this in our safety meeting, I could update. I’m not too concerned like I have no problem quitting, I’d just rather get fired haha. I already told them a few months ago I’m never getting vaccinated for it, so we shall see;)</p>

        <p>Okay so at the meeting they told us that me and the other guy will have to wear masks 100% of the time on premises (even though I work ~30-50 ft away from everyone at a given time. They even admitted that the vaccines do not stop transmission or necessarily contraction of covid, but only the unvaxxed will be masked. They said the shots will be free choice and they will not require it. They said this is because there are people who have kids that can’t be vaccinated (I have the youngest child of all of them) and I was given weird looks by everyone. It was a nice time.</p>

        <p>Depends.</p>
<p>Is it a Mask worn as PPE and as an employee to protect you against customers that may infect you?This is not abnormal, as many workplaces require safety equipment for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Is it a Mask because he believes you are infectious, and does he require  you to expose your medical info?</p>
<p>Would be like you working for a demolition company or gyproc company, and them asking you to wear PPE to protect your lungs and you quit.. you won't be covered by unemployment.</p>

        <p>Not REQUIRING for me to expose my status, but I was upfront with my manager telling him I’m not getting vaccinated for this, ever. And not as PPE, they only want me and the other vaccinated guy to wear masks while on the premises. I just think that’s the weird part because asymptomatic spread doesn’t exist and I stay home when I don’t feel well anyways. If I quit, I’m not eligible for unemployment at all, right?</p>
