    <strong>I just can't believe it.</strong>
    <p><p>So this March before everything went all #flattenthecurve, oh wait #staythefuckhomeforever, I was enrolled in an Auto Body Technology program. We went on spring break and never came back. At least not in person. There were still cars that needed to be completed before the end of the year and one of them was mine. So thankfully I got to get more real auto body experience. So let's flash forward to now. I have applied and/or emailed over 15 different auto body shops in my area seeing if they were taking on any apprentices. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I just can't believe it. When I started the program we had shops calling my instructor the very first week of school asking if anybody wants to come work. Of course, we had zero experience and who knew what would happen over the next year. So here I am. Still working my janitor job and trying to hold it together. My mental state of mind has taken a turn for the worse. And I can't believe that people have the gall to say that we're the selfish ones. Just because I would love to see us reopen again and start a career. God their arrogance is astounding. Anyway thanks for listening to my rant.</p></p>

        <p>That’s depressing. Ever thought of moving to a state that’s open? Look on ZipRecruiter, there are dozens of apprenticeship jobs here in Georgia. Don’t know if that’s even possible for you to do , just a suggestion. Can’t imagine being denied what so many of us take for granted; freedom to be yourself.</p>

        <p>Move quickly before others beat you to it, and don't be so late that the new transplants have already started arriving and replicating the crisis they're fleeing from.  </p>
<p>I would not put it past transplants rushing there then by 2021 winter they are screaming 'LOCK IT DOWN THIRD WAVE", you've got to act fast before the narrative turns then everyone will be acting like they "knew all along the lockdown was wrong" and then people are so dumb I bet they will still fall for it all over again.</p>

        <p>Check Arizona job listings. Car places here have appeared to be bursting at the seams this entire time. Our state isn’t authoritarian tbh. Masks are business-optional at this point and everything is now open. And no winter! LOL. But for real good luck to you! There will always be demand for mechanics even if there’s a lull currently.</p>

        <p>That really sucks man, sorry to hear it.  This is all such bullshit.  Even with these recent CDC reports and the NYT article saying that upwards of 90% of positives tests probably should have been negative and yet still............no fucking end in sight.</p>
<p>Most of us have never felt so helpless.  There is little to nothing that we can do.  Revolutionaries running around unchecked in our streets; governors callously taking away whatever civil liberties we had left.  Having to beg local government for permission to carry on business is something you don’t see in some third world countries.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I have to agree with you. Meanwhile, our sister sub is celebrating how the tide is turning, everything is beginning to open up, etc. I just don't see things changing especially at this much of a rapid pace. Hell, it seems Cuomo now wants to end outdoor dining and impose more restrictions in NY, how is that "the tide turning"?</p>

        <p>I feared something like this. I'm in automotive technology in Duluth, MN and my biggest fear is that shops will look at anyone who graduated in 2020 or 2021 and think we're inferior technicians because we were forced to take the last half of a semester online. Fortunately for me I got to go back in July to finish my lost semester, but it was still thrown together and rushed.</p>
<p>I am beyond furious with Tim Walz. It's like he doesn't even care about the damage he's caused. I'm also beyond furious with the people of Minnesota for putting up with it. </p>
<p>The worst part is how he constantly nonchalantly threatens to lock down again as if he's a dictator with absolute control. At least congressional Republicans are starting to get his cabinet members removed. Any kind of retaliation against that scumbag is oh so sweet. Luckily I got my Auto Body degree in 2019 so if I have to, I can fall back on that.</p>
<p>This sucks man. This really sucks. I hope and pray against all odds that one day there will be a reckoning for the bastards that did this to us. They deserve anything and everything that's coming to them.</p>
