    <strong>Doomers are willfully ignorant to the extreme negative effects to the lockdowns because admitting so would crush their world view for the last year.</strong>
    <p><p>They need to keep their Covid fear going, double down, get vaccinated, tell everyone else to get the shot, and I believe it’s all in the subconscious. Admitting your wrong and that people’s lives, business, mental heath and happiness was crushed for nothing would be too much for them. So keep saying save grandma and world wide pandemic and keep watching the CNN death toll to keep them believing they did the “ right” thing. Cuz admitting they were wrong is admitting they were scared and duped for no reason. And I think some are starting to realize their in the minority of people and revert to 5th grade following the rules and telling on u to feel better. Again I think it’s a subconscious thing and I pity these people tbh</p></p>

        <p>I think most people, and I include myself in this understood “2 weeks to flatten the curve” last March. The continuation of restrictions was then clear to all that the costs massively outweighed the benefits. Then couple that with absolutely no correlation whatsoever between lockdowns and hospital admissions most doomers now realise they fucked up. </p>
<p>However, they are so far down the rabbit hole, so heavily invested, been so nasty to so many people they just can’t lose face on this. They have to keep up the theatre. If they admitted they were wrong they would have to start understanding that their hysteria has destroyed so many lives. So rather than admit it, they double down. </p>
<p>I like to think I’m grown up enough to forgive the doomers if they actually came out and said they were wrong. But I don’t think I can, their actions have caused so much destruction I can never forgive them.</p>

        <p>Sunk cost fallacy. To admit the truth would also require an admission that they willing threw a year of their lives over the cliff for no damned reason.</p>

        <p>Mark Twain said that "It's easier to fool people than convince them that they have been fooled." Think about all the people who got vaccinated - do you think they'll be willing to admit it was all a ruse, and now they have this unknown stuff in their bodies doing who knows what? They have to cling to the narrative - too scary otherwise.</p>

        <p>that’s what I think. They all panicked rushed out to get vaccinated allowed their fear and the government to crush people for a year and now it’s all gotta he justified somehow so keep being afraid and not only that act moral and superior to make you feel better</p>

        <p>My own family have watched as all the COVID bullshit has crushed me. My wedding and honeymoon cancelled. My husband unable to attend any ultrasounds or doctors appointments for our first baby. And then, worst of all, my husband being kicked out of the hospital after a traumatic c-section because I tested positive for COVID. No symptoms, almost certainly a false positive.</p>
<p>They still fucking support masks and distancing and business closures. Oh, what happened to me is <em>wrong</em> to them. It upsets them. They hate that it happened to me. But they fail to see the larger picture. How their acceptance of all this bullshit makes it possible for hospitals to make these horrendous policies. They can’t connect the dots because doing so would implicate them in their own daughters/sisters personal tragedy. </p>
<p>My rage at them is unbearable.</p>

        <p>I’ve noticed the 6 feet, where I live, very quickly devolved to “Whatever, just don’t yell at me.”</p>
<p>Like, the weed dispensary is the only place they actually obey the rules because everyone fears giving the government a reason to shut that down.</p>

        <p>I recall early days of the “Six feet” thing and I was in line at Wal-Mart to get a money order to pay rent since my landlord is still in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Anyways, Wal-Mart being Wal-Mart they had one cashier and a huge fucking line without six feet distancing. A manager came over and demanded we spread out. The guy ahead of me in line said “Fuck you and get more cashiers.”</p>
<p>That’s been the general attitude of most people.</p>
