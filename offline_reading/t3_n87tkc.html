    <strong>The virus....</strong>
    <p><p>Has never been physically isolated and sequenced.</p>
<p>CDC website states they have isolated a virus , but reading the actual study, you realize they didn’t actually isolate a virus that’s proven to cause covid.</p>
<p>None of this other shit even matters .</p>
<p>The very foundation of the pandemic can be seen to be complete bullshit by reading the CDCs own articles .</p>
<p>If the virus hasn’t been physically isolated and proven to cause covid, what is SARS-CoV2?</p>
<p>Its a theoretical model of a virus that doesn’t exist in physical reality . It’s a model that only exists in a computer ...</p>
<p>And they designed vaccines based on this ....</p>
<p>The model they created contains PCR markers found in bacteria and archaea, which is why the false positives occurred since nearly anything could test positive for the “virus “ being tested for since parts of it exist in almost everything .</p>
<p>Just wanted to throw that out there.</p>
<p>It’s not wild conspiracy, they just count on people not taking time to read the studies and understanding them...</p></p>

        <p>Yeah the fact that the COVID ad campaign started with so many "red alien sphere" 3d model renders plastered across the advertising was a little sus. There are people who thought those were real. Why not just be honest and show the real deal as opposed to the shiny PR version?</p>

        <p>Yeah, the entire thing is a fraud, there's no special illness, they just rebranded common respiratory ailments and use a bogus test. It's pretty simple, just a basic con done by the greasy drug company mafia. They needed the illusion of a special virus to help with this massive vaccine/vaccine passport rent-seeking putsch, that is the real event. The virus is the misdirection so we don't focus on the rent-seeking.</p>
<p>Don't talk about it though, Pfizer needs that "durable income stream". Don't get between a greasy, murderous crook and his money!</p>
