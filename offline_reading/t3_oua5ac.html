    <strong>What are our rights right now?</strong>
    <p><p>Dear friends, what are our current "rights" in the workplace given the slow but sure enforcement of the c19 v<em>xine? For context, my brother in law had a government "representative" come by his workplace and do a headcount of those who have been v</em>xinated vs. not. How is this at all okay? I fear this or something similar will become a common thing at all of our places of work, but to what end; termination if we say we haven't been vaccinated? BiL lives in Quebec, Canada and I live in Ontario.</p>
<p>I have no idea how best to navigate this type of scenario should it happen at my workplace. Have any of you experienced this type of thing? Any advice in terms of how to "protect" ourselves? Do we have any "rights" left at all?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></p>

        <p>We have no rights.  The workplace is a private entity and we are in their premises and subject to their policies.  It is our prerogative to not abide by those rules but at the potential cost of employment.</p>

        <p>Care sector U.K here - been going through it for a fair while.<br>
Firstly remain undecided until you're escorted off the premises - you can always back and forth and test them - but ask for any queries you have towards taking the vaccine to be given in written/typed form sent by letter to your address. Use texts and talk to go back and forth fucking with them - it's not particularly admissable in a court of law anyway, but you may want to buy a cheap stealth recording mp3 anyway. Obviously depending on your profe$$ion but generally across the board they're absolutely terrified of the 'class action lawsuit' from wherever it may come apparently.<br>
Secondly - you'll see this lots.. Swallow your pride.. Are you a straight man? Are you absolutely sure? I thought I was until recently I realised not long ago I was actually a Masculine presenting Transgender Lesbian, ,  ,and not only that - I think I might be pregnant,, perpetually. I know it's miraculous but just let that sink in while you watch most of your supposedly Cis-gender Vax Hesitant sisters claim publicly they're suddenly trying for a kid at 40 even though they've told everyone last week they hate the thought of ever conceiving. . And my periods oh boy don't get me started on them but have you looked into spontaneous miscarriage rates for the Vaccine? If you do spontaneously combust will your employer pay damages?<br>
I'm a bearded pregnant lesbian and you may be too and even if I abort a kid every day or so down the U-bend all I'm saying is it may help your case.<br>
 Thirdly - I haven't used this card yet but have you looked into Christian Science (etc) like me? There's a few of us around and I haven't officially joined (or read much more than the website) but we believe in the power of prayer to give us everlasting Covid-19 antibodies. I tend to hold differing beliefs all at once but my Imam (peace be upon her) told me the vaccine is made from pork and it says everyone in Islam is in to the Christian Science belief that you can literally pray the vaccine into yourself and others (go the whole hog) through the power of prayer. <br>
I could copy/paste endless retorts and emails to my superiors but you can do your own. Get creative. Have fun. But don't be shocked when all you hear back for months is crickets and tumbleweeds.My Union haven't got a fucking clue either. Unchartered territory but they advise not to quit until you're fired for not taking the vaccine. However in the meantime they might nit-pick try to get rid of you for anything if they're particularly desperate. But just keep on cranking out the concerns and note the no replies as proof that they're more worried you won't be coerced than the others. You'd be surprised how many militant anti(this-experimental)vax end up caving due to the first underhand threats of losing their job / debt worry / no back-up plan.<br>
 Fourthly - Serious now - tell them you're on Ivermectin point blank for their own health and safety as well as your own and get on it. The mountain of evidence for it may not help you just yet but later down the line in a court? Buy it. Take it. It's a cheap anti-parasitic horse paste. Zinc, Vitamin C / D etc blah but for God's sake mention Ivermectin soon as. Everyone's different, others often cave surprisingly early often due to taking idle threats too seriously, more attachments, more a slave to the hordes on social media / idiot box. The Off button is your best friend. Remember this is peak Clown-world - relish the absurdity. Keep your humour and all your documents (presume you're being stealth recorded if shit's getting serious though so stealth record back).Trust nobody, fuck I don't even trust me. Do I even exist? I doubt it.. But then if I don't think I am not thus I am not eligible for some bullshit vaccine.   And so on ad infinitum. <br>
Stay creative. Don't think you're alone in this lunatic asylum.  Keep them hanging. I'm pregnant. So is everyone. Christian Science will someday join forces with Dutch Reformed to pray the Covid away live via group cyber-meditation live on NNN sister. Inshallah. Tomorrow it is.. Tell them a variant of any of this.  Creativity. You don't need a vaccine,, you Are the Vaccine. There's a lot more but that's maybe a starter for 10. <a href="https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/religion-vaccination-confusion">https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/blog/religion-vaccination-confusion</a></p>

        <p>my privilege,, did some edits including perhaps your primary no brainer - seriously mention the Ivermectin, it's about $5 for a months supply prophylactic and rattle off the studies from this (Pierre Kory / Dr Mo Been /Brett Weinstein etc).It's an initial serious warning shot that you're not just fucking around.If you want to keep in touch I'm fine sharing my initial barrage of questions to the higher ups but I'd get in on the Ivermectin first if I could.Bear in mind although this was my career it was low stress low pay. I'm done with it and can afford to try to make my deputy manager chortle knowing I'm not as likely as others to get some big cash settlement.A really sad revelation I learned is it's actually the ones just above you like Deputy managers who were told weeks/months back to get the vaccine or their low hanging but genuine career is over. And they usually cave. But then again maybe my deputy manager was told by her CEO to fake that she already had to take it or she'd be gone. Trust nobody - but then again if you're happy whittling your time down to the wire anyway you may like me have less to lose.Oh and this is just the UK but if you quit you may have a few months of benefit sanctions but if you're fired you can immediately suckle on the milky teat of your fellow taxpayers benefits. Fuck it you deserve a few months break and most have been suckling on the same teat rebranded 'furlough' here anyway. No shame. Me and millions of others will be seeing and congrugating with you in a court in Nuremburg as the prosecution against all this horseshit. Bollocks to it chief. <br>
