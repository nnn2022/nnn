    <strong>Remember the tactic teachers would use when trying to extract a confession from a single child?</strong>
    <p><p>They would punish the entire class - withhold something from them, or bluff about not letting anybody leave the classroom until the guilty party fessed up. They knew they could count on the other children turning on that individual, for their own short-sighted, selfish, fearful reasons - not thinking ahead to some future date when they might require the solidarity of the entire class to be on their side.</p>
<p>This is what we are heading for with the vaccines. All the pro-vax people will rush to get vaccinated, and then <strong>the media and authorities will claim that the ONLY reason things can't go back to normal, is that not enough people are vaccinated yet.</strong> People will start snitching on, publicly shaming, in some cases probably even physically assaulting anybody they know who is "holding everything up". There will be a massive campaign launched to coerce, exclude, ostracize anybody who isn't demonstrably vaccinated - and that's just at the social level, not even the legal level, which will surely come later.</p>
<p>We've already seen a preview of this with the mask hysteria - pro-maskers believe that the only reason for each subsequent shutdown, is that too many dissidents were having too much fun during past shutdowns, necessitating repeated or more harsh restrictions. "If only you would obey, this would be over!!" nevermind the fact that there aren't even any public places left that allow people to walk around unmasked. But still they believe it's a sneaky 0.01% somewhere, somehow getting away with it, and coofing all our freedoms away.</p>
<p>Anyway, just a heads-up about the next major challenge that lies ahead for us. Not that we aren't already being blamed, but the public pressure that's about to be heaped upon us is going to be 10x worse and more in-your-face. The possibility of life going 100% back to normal is going to be very compelling carrot to dangle in front of the average person, to encourage them to turn on their friends and family, or anybody they remotely know, who is still holding out.</p></p>

<p>The same media, political figures, and "health experts" that keep gaslighting us claiming that "The masks, lockdowns, etc are all <em>your</em> fault" are the ones who keep stating "We are <em>never</em> going back to normal".</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the chance to exercise petty dominance over others, the chance to conspicuously signal one's goodness, "caring", and virtue, and the desire to lick the boots of anyone in authority for personal gain are deeply ingrained in most people now. These traits will win over critical thinking and common sense, every time.</p>
<p>Also, most NPC's would rather follow along and would send us dissidents to the gas chambers rather than admit they have been wrong, and have been duped.</p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance is one hell of a drug.</p>

        <p>You're definitely correct with this .. it's going to be very dark, very difficult, and very scary eventually but we have to hang onto our butts and support one another in any way we can. Minimize your circle only to those that are with you and ready to resist if you can.</p>
<p>I've pretty much lost all friends this year, I have a small amount of family but we're here and ready. They're the only ones left who I trust not to turn on me. Even friends that claimed they understood/supported my positions but weren't resisting themselves I've found I had to leave behind.. not because I don't wish them the best but because I don't trust them. They are taking the easy way but freedom isn't easy.</p>
<p>I really hope this is all a worst case scenario and nothing I've thought these past months comes to fruition, it definitely of course isn't guaranteed to happen, but if it does I want to be prepared not only physically but mentally/emotionally.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, I recommend keeping your head down for as long as you can. If someone asks you about your status that you don't think you can trust, just simply reply, "No, not yet" or lie if you have to. No shame in the game at this point. Do what you have to do.</p>

        <p>How are random people going to know if you've gotten the vaccine or not? These kinds of people won't say shit if they aren't being reminded by it constantly. Masks are a visual prop, because once they stop seeing masks around because vaccines were rolled out. Things will start to seem normal again and they'll retreat back into their vain little worlds.</p>

        <p>&rt; because once they stop seeing masks around because vaccines were rolled out</p>
<p>Media/experts are already letting people know the masks are going to be around for awhile, even while the vaccines are being distributed. That ever-present reminder isn't going away any time soon. And the more cynical among us wonder if they are ever going away, even post-mass-vaccination.</p>
<p>&rt; How are random people going to know if you've gotten the vaccine or not</p>
<p>Where did I say random people? It's going to be the people who know us already - family members who know our stances, friends we've disagreed with in the past, etc. Social media is already a place where people get blasted for not going along with groupthink. What happens when you get submitted to something like /r/PublicFreakout when somebody in the real world catches wind of your vaccination status? (see blow)</p>
<p>But your deeper question, I guess, is "how can it be proven you still haven't gotten vaccinated"? Well, that's where all this stuff is heading with the 'health passports' etc. What do you think the ID2020 initiative is? Why do you think Gates (via his foundation) is pushing both vaccines and a global ID system tied to health information? To say nothing of what the World Economic Forum has cooked up for us ...</p>
<p>After 8 months of this, isn't it becoming obvious that this year is making the previously-unthinkable happen in lockstep around the globe? Is it really so hard to imagine even social media might be plugged into these Orwellian information grids? What if Facebook offers an integration that lets you connect with your health ID, to <strong>proudly</strong> let everybody know you got vaccinated and are doing your part?</p>
<p>That may seem extreme from where we stand at this moment, but everything we're going through now seemed impossibly extreme 8 months ago. We've already seen a good deal of the population championing all these individual-liberty-curtailing developments.</p>
<p>What happens when supermarkets require unvaccinated people to wear some kind of identifying marker, so that everybody else in the store can know to avoid them? Or they can only shop during certain hours, after everybody else?</p>
<p>If you can't see the possibilities on the horizon, you're not thinking dystopian enough.</p>
