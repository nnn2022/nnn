        <p>So what? You want all of us to just give up? </p>
<p>Nah, I'm not giving up hope. Call me stubborn or naive or whatever, but I'm not letting these doomers win. I'd rather fucking die and accept this BS normal. <em>You</em> can accept this and submit to the doomers, but for me and probably the other 12k people or so in this sub, we're NEVER going to submit to them.</p>

        <p>You can claim defeat for yourself if you want.  Honestly, I don't care either way, since it's your life to live and your choice to make.</p>
<p>But you don't get to claim defeat for me.</p>
<p>I'm just curious why it's so important to you to convince other people to give up.  If we've lost, I wonder why it matters to you that everyone gives up at exactly the same time you do.</p>

        <p>There’s no winning this war. As Wonder Bet said:</p>
<p>What you gonna do? Organise protests? You think the NWO gives two flying fucks about protests? All they'll have to do is to put a few agents in each protest and kill a few policemen, allegedly by the protesters. Then there will be a complete clampdown on all protests, and the media and the hordes of sheep will do the rest.</p>
<p>The masterminds behind this have been doing this sort of things for hundreds if not thousands of years. They have all the knowledge and expertise retained through their bloodlines. We are like toddlers in front of them. They are behind every single war, every assassination, every major "terror attack", every "people's" revolution and every social "movement". They successfully implemented all the communist regimes you've ever seen in the world.</p>

        <p>I don't plan on organizing protests.  I think many things you say are correct.  I'm not particularly smart, and the people in charge are a lot smarter than me and have more resources.</p>
<p>This is what I am going to do/have been doing: In the last few months I've quit any jobs/activities that I believed were treating the participants inappropriately, mostly by requiring masks and putting restrictions on their personal lives.  I've found other jobs and activities that don't require those things of people participating.  I've found potential places to move which are almost completely open, and I will focus on those next.</p>
<p>If I assume that everything you predict is going to happen, I still may have a short window of time where good places are accessable (weeks, months, or years).  Why would I waste that time by giving up now?  </p>
<p>For all I know, I could be killed by some accident or die of natural causes in a month or a year.  I would rather spend that time free (and yes, I have physically been to places within the last week where I could live freely).</p>
<p>So I won't live forever either way, and I would rather spend the rest of my life hopeful and not giving up.  I grew up in a situation where many freedoms were denied to me, and I did give up for many years.  From personal experience, one day with hope and working toward freedom is worth more to me than years of giving up and not even trying to get out.</p>
