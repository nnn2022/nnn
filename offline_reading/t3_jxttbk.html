    <strong>New Hampshire statewide mask mandate and that was my "safe space" - what now?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in MA. I'm moving within the next year with plans to go to NH, as I've heard the people are pretty serious about "living free" and I have some friends/family there. But with news of a mask mandate and even a vaccine this winter for frontline workers and spring for general public, I feel like my safety plan is falling through. Will the people of NH take this seriously? Where the hell can I go now? I know civil disobedience is the overall answer no matter where I go. But I just want some freedom and less stress before the world goes to complete shit and I am feeling beyond hopeless. MA is draining me. I don't know where to go or what to do. South Dakota maybe but is moving even worth it? If anyone else is feeling this struggle, which I'm sure there's plenty of people, what are you doing to cope? Are you moving somewhere? Is there even a state where people aren't dealing with this bullshit?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and hopefully things get better.</p></p>

        <p>NH is the sanest state in the region, but that's not a high bar. There are probably others that get less attention, but the only state I would trust is South Dakota, and even then I would be wary of larger cities, of which they don't have many. I'd be hesitant to move because every time it looks like somewhere is safe they follow the pack to some new asinine rule or a second lockdown. Though it would be a safe bet it's hard to get worse than MA.</p>

        <p>it's hard to not get caught up in the "blue vs. red" states bc NH is blue, surprisingly, yet I still hear that it's the most liberated so that gives me some hope. SD has been #1 with all this though, I hear ya. and definitely feeling that hesitation. but spot on about MA, this place sucks haha</p>

        <p>You can find worse. HI, CA, NY, all already awful for more reasons than coronavirus. But for the most part you could throw a dart at a map and most likely end up somewhere better than MA.</p>

        <p>Am up in Maine and have been doing extensive reaearch into moving to a sane state. The only one that's truly seemed sane through all this, and seems like they won't at all change that, is South Dakota. Many other states are currently going way backwards. And even if they aren't, the cities/counties in these states are mandating masks, imposing restrictions on businesses, etc. Plus you also have businesses imposing restrictions on themselves.</p>
<p>So really, South Dakota is the only place in the US that I can trust to not have knee-jerk reactions and flip their shit. Sioux Falls seems to be a very solid option.</p>
<p>As far as New Hampshire goes, I was travelling all over the state this August for many job interviews. Businesses are and people are essentially forced into "caring" about this virus. Most of the management, employees, and customers didn't give a fuck about it. I routinely saw large groups of random people crowding downtown areas of various towns/cities without any masks. Went down to a little beach town one night where it was absolutely packed, both inside and outside the bars/stores. And almost no one had a mask on or wore it properly, employees included. There were several venues hosting live music, no social distancing, and virtually no masks. Just people having an awesome time and living their lives. So I can't imagine that attitude will change very much, regardless of what their government does.</p>

        <p>I moved rural instead of moving out of state.  It was a great decision since few people seem to care about regulations here.  They are even having some holiday events without restrictions.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with NH area but would suggest exploring rural parts to see if they really end up following the restrictions before you give up on NH entirely.</p>
