    <strong>Masks are unnecessary. If you are scared of catching Covid, then wear a plastic face shield.</strong>
    <p><p>Almost all person-to-person infections come from saliva or mucus being projected at someones face, where it can then enter the mouth, nose, or eyes. If you wear a plastic face shield, you can stop pretty much 100% of everything from ever hitting your face, even if a maskless person was to cough on you 2 feet away.</p>
<p>Its basically fool-proof. Just for your own safety, clean it every day with disinfectant, wash your hands daily, and shower every day. You now can easily protect your own health without infringing on people's basic human rights and bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>Masks can actually be harmful if abused, as not changing them daily like with washing your hands means you just carry the dirt, bacteria, and possible contaminants with you and possibly reinfect yourself later. Most people wearing these masks aren't even changing them every day, sometimes not even once a week. Its really disgusting. </p>
<p>Not to mention masks lowering oxygen intake, blocking facial expressions and leading to feelings of alienation and dejection, and discouraging the wearer from drinking water because it takes more effort and their face feel unnaturally moist all the time. All three of these things, less water, less oxygen, and less mental health, all have been scientifically proven to seriously hurt the immune system. Also, by staying indoors all the time you are missing critical Vitamin D, which you can easily become depressed and sickly if you are deficient in it.</p>
<p>The best way to stop Covid transmission is just for people who worry about it to wear plastic face shields. Maks aren't necessary unless you are positively sick, but even then, wouldn't your plastic face shield do the trick if it was good enough? Either way, masks are unnecessary for healthy people and only easily fooled morons think otherwise.</p></p>

        <p>Technically a shield is not completely safe too, because when you breathe, the air goes around the shield, so you still breathe in the stuff that is still in the air, to be safe, you would need a gas mask.</p>

        <p>Jokes aside, i dont think saliva and mucus particles are going to be transmissible between parties if concerned parties shield up. Saliva is heavy and falls to the ground in mere seconds</p>

        <p>I don't think theres evidence that Covid is literally airborne and not just passed through spitting and coughing. You breathe or talk into a face shield, most of that saliva gets curved down to the ground anyways, if tiny particles shoot off the sides then its probably steeper than 45Â° and its not going to hit anyone</p>

        <p>It's "airborne", it cannot survive by itself on dust particles or completely alone, it needs water, but not much water, you can try spraying water into the air with some spray bottle and then breathe in the little droplets, with and without shield, you catch most of it with the shield, but some does go around</p>

Air flow analysis shows only a face shield is not sufficient. Combining it with a face mask gives yourself and others the best protection.</p>
<p>The best solution is to stay home, make trips quick using BOTH a face shield and face mask, and if nothing else have a quarantine group that you can be safe with.</p>
