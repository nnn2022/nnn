        <p>This sub is about recognising that the risk is not worth shutting down the world, demolishing mental health, delaying life-saving treatments, manufacturing a wave of poverty and coercing citizens into taking experimental substances.</p>
<p>Ironic that you chose the second order effects flair. You want to talk about actually risking lives? Talk about that. The families of excess deaths must think you’re a hero too.</p>

        <p>Many medical and health professionals believe that the effects of the lockdowns will result in more deaths than Covid can cause. The virus has a &rt;99.6% survival rate for most people, and the science has existed for years showing that masks are ineffective at slowing the spread of cold and flu viruses.</p>
<p>This only scratches the surface.</p>
<p>With facts like these in mind, I have a moral obligation to withstand laws and mandates that directly attack my personal freedoms using lies and half-truths. </p>

        <p>It's December 2, 2019. Going about your normal life is killing people. You're spreading viral and bacterial respiratory infections without even knowing it (and occasionally when you know you're "coming down with something"). Because of your actions, a relative, a neighbor, a friend, or a coworker was either hospitalized or missed work. </p>
<p>It's been happening all of your life.</p>

        <p>The only valid reason I can think of to have rule 3 is just a CYA for the sub-reddit to say that "we don't promote violence." I am violent pacifistic. Meaning, I'm all about peace &amp; love until you threaten me, and the gloves come on and its ass kicking time.</p>
<p>Now of course, this does not stop doomer dick heads from threatening our livelihoods or physically threatening us folks or our family and friends who are against this pandemic scam. In that case, I will respond accordingly to ensure the physical safety of my friends, family or myself and stop the threat.</p>
<p>/rant/</p>
<p>I do not understand how you can honestly say this sub-reddit is about risking people's lives. If you have looked around this sub-reddit, you will see people say, "if you are ill, or not healthy to be outside, stay home, let us healthy people go about our lives."</p>
<p>There is no reason to destroy people's lives over something you have a 99% to survive like the influenza. When I got bronchitis, when the outbreaks of Ebola, H1N1, Zika, MERS, SARS, Avian Flu, or influenza season came about, did we shut down the world's economy? No, we did not, we treated the sick, and we went about our lives.</p>
<p>This whole "pandemic" is an over reaction, and it is being used to enslave humanity. Don't believe me? Look at the measures being taken "for your safety." Straight out of the NAZI hand book, word for word, action for action. Still don't believe me? Okay, do research on how the NAZIS came to power. I'll give you a small hint, Hitler and his goons did not march into Berlin with army tanks.</p>
<p>I can see it now, you saying, we can't compare what the NAZIS did to what is happening now. To which, I would point out, look at what is happening in my country, the U.S. and other Western democracies. You have governors, and mayors forcing people to:</p>
<ul>
<li>close their businesses,</li>
<li>snitch on your family members, friends and neighbors</li>
<li>curfews, banning travel and protests</li>
<li>banning religious gatherings,</li>
<li>closing down parks, gyms, etc.</li>
<li>Forcing people to wear medical devices even when they are not sick,</li>
<li>telling the whole country it is only for a few weeks, but its been almost 9 months,</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a guess who did the same thing gradually? The NAZIS! Now none of this is a consequence to you because odds are you are not history person or student of history so I can not expect you to know this. However, in my opinion, ignorance of history is not an excuse.</p>
<p>Being now that the mainstream media are just mouth pieces for TPTB, they keep repeating the same nonsense drivel over and over:</p>
<ul>
<li>people who don't wear masks are evil, or don't believe in the shutdowns want to kill grand ma and pappy</li>
<li>people who don't want to close their businesses are selfish</li>
<li>people who question the narrative, they're conspiracy theorists</li>
<li>people who don't want to take the COVID-19 vaccine are a danger to the community</li>
</ul>
<p>Now where have I seen this tactic before? Oh wait, the NAZIS! When the NAZIS told the German people to fear the Jews, communists, Roma and ANYONE who does not agree with the new normal; they're out to get you so you better beware and don't do business with them. That they are the one's responsible for what happened to Germany in World War I, so guess what people of Germany, we are putting in a new normal but don't worry, "<strong><em>es ist zu ihrer sicherheit!</em></strong>"</p>
