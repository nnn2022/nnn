    <strong>Other than it being contagious, what have "the experts" been right about for more than a sandwich and a cup of coffee?</strong>
    <p><p>And even with the contagious part the World Health Organization started out by saying it <em>wasn't</em>.  Early on that Ferguson model set the tone for all of the draconian restrictions, and that turned out to be total bunk. Along the way they scared us into thinking that surface transmission was a big threat, until they took that back.  It took quite a while before we found out it is primarily aerosolized, that's how it is transferred.  Of course there were the hypocritical things along the way; Saint Fauci (mbuh) was saying that asymptomatic spread isn't the driving force behind pandemics, while at the same time we were told to pretend we are sick even when we're not by wearing a mask. And at first we were told there's no point in wearing a mask, that was changed to it being mandatory one wears a mask, and for about a day and a half it was deemed better to wear <em>two</em> masks, but the polling on that was bad so it was quickly retracted.  (If anyone has a better explanation on why that idea was quickly retracted I'd love to hear it).  Many places closed down the parks...... that was "the science" at the time I guess, but I've never seen the data to support it.  Lots of 'leaders' said one thing and did another, all along the way.  Rules that don't make any sense at all have been implemented; must wear mask on jet, unless eating or drinking.  Five governors in the United States forced nursing homes to accept Covid-19 positive patients.  That wasn't just wrong, it was criminal, or at least should be.  I don't think it's hyperbole to say that Newsom, Cuomo, Whitmer, Murphy and Wolf have blood on their hands.</p>
<p>We were told to not go to church, but Costco is fine.  No indoor dining, unless you make the outdoors indoors, then that is fine.  And sometimes one restaurant had to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/foodanddrink/other/a-slap-in-my-face-la-restaurant-owner-s-video-showing-a-film-shoot-s-catering-tent-set-up-next-to-her-closed-eatery-goes-viral/ar-BB1bI54v">close</a> while the one Hollywood was using was allowed to stay open.</p>
<p>So many times, so many things have been wrong.  And I get that new data comes in sometimes, and that's why many people would like for that to happen before injecting a new technology into their bodies.</p>
<p>How is that unreasonable to anyone?</p></p>

        <p>Was it ever really that contagious?  How many other illnesses were repurposed to make it appear contagious?</p>
