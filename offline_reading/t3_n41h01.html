        <p>Even when you ARE sick. Seriously, tell me that in 2019 and prior, you actually wore a face diaper when you came in sick to work or school, or to go somewhere like a store.</p>

        <p>I remember in school, after enough absences, they <em>expected</em> me to come, even if I was sick and/or contagious. I came to work sick plenty of times and so did my bosses and teachers and I've been the store sick plenty of times. It's not like you're in a hospital, you're out and about. Sickness spreads, it's just how it works.</p>

        <p>Bad meme. Masks never stop a virus whether you are sick or not. If you're sick you should stay home if you want to protect others and yourself. This lie that a masks works EVER needs to stop. It blocks bacteria particles like spit and mucus. Most people already know how to cover their mouths and will remove their mask to sneeze and cover their mouth anyway.</p>

        <p>So the logic here is just following the normal pre COVID norms/logic that was common in Japan and other Eastern countries. Their people wore masks when sick during winter times when out in public or at work. Not everyone did but it was a courtesy thing. I was in Japan just before COVID times so saw the actual extent at which people masked, and it was the sick not the healthy who do so (and not even all of them).</p>
<p>However whether they work or not is unclear, Japan and other Eastern countries never showed much of a difference when it came to flu outbreaks and deaths to the western world. Additionally part of the reason you saw such mask wearing in Japan was because they have a culture of overworking and not taking any sick leave at all (unless you physically can't move). Whereas western countries do encourage sick leave, at least European ones do, which is obviously effective! As you say; if you're sick, stay home.</p>

        <p>Also, the POINT of masks is to create a minority on which to blame the pandemic.</p>
<p>Very few people blame the politicians, Big Pharma, Big Tech and other transnational corporations that gain power and  wealth from the Covid-19 response.</p>
<p>No, they blame people that don't wear masks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a minority.</li>
<li>Do something terrible.</li>
<li>Blame the minority for the terrible thing you did.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's very important to remember this and communicate it to others, about masks. Seatbelts, helmets, and other smaller infringements on our individual liberties were never used to justify lockdowns, forced business closures, curfews, hide austerity measures, and censor dissent the way masks have been.</p>
<p>THAT is the primary reason for requiring people to wear a mask.</p>
<p>It's also why masks were politicized. None of this would have worked if they hadn't made people think wearing a mask was a way to show the world how progressive they are, and not wearing one means you're a "dumb Trump supporter."</p>
<p>There are other secondary and tertiary benefits as well... Like the way masks disorient, scare, and otherwise upset people. </p>
<p>Also, mandatory mask policies create the illusion that everyone is in agreement with them, while simultaneously making it difficult to communicate that they aren't.</p>
<p>The masks &amp; social restrictions also make business difficult even for companies that were allowed to stay open... And the economic hit of business closures and restrictions was certainly intended --- because they needed to obscure a global financial collapse.</p>
<p>So by using the virus, they were able to create another scapegoat and obscure a global debt crisis as well as blaming the economic impact on the virus itself rather than economic policies for the last decades which actually brought us to the breaking point.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but... None of these silly examples people throw around are comparable to wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Also, there is a time and a place for seatbelts. I rarely wear one in the back seat as it is not mandatory. However, depending on who is driving and the road conditions, I will buckle up if there is a high risk.</p>
