    <strong>would it help if I would surrender ? if I would let them do to me whatever they want ? ... no, I do not think so</strong>
    <p><p>i am trying to understand the psychology of self-sacrifice, offering oneself to being slaughtered on the altar of the empire...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Jesus told people that paradise is within, a way to get there is to love and forgive each other ...one of his followers told the roman empire, the occupiers... his whereabouts, they catched him and tortured him to death using their favourite torture device ... the cross ... teaching him and everyone a lesson what happens if one dares to inspire others to have hope to reach paradise</p>
<p>jesus would allow all this to happen because of showing people that it is a good thing to sacrifice oneself for others or and ... if one gets beaten once, one will offer the attacker a chance to beat a second time</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>while I fully agree with non-violence being the highest way and defending oneself eventually even inspiring an attacker to become more violent</p>
<p>while if one can bring up the suffering tolerance to let the attacker satisfy his/her/its pain inflicting demands ... the cycle might be transformed</p>
<p>like If I stop reacting to people who mock me than sometimes soon their incentive to harass me goes away as it makes very little fun trying to hurt someone who shows no sign of feeling that hurt ...</p>
<p>so all I have to do is to train myself of not opposing their hurting ways but to endure them patiently until they are satisfied enough in their sadistic past-time hobby of mobbing people</p>
<p>okay ... it seems i get somewhere in my understanding of possible advantages of self-sacrifice ...</p>
<p>why it might eventually be a high risk bet wether or not one can reach the soul of the attacker by allowing the attacker to go trough with the attack... by not running away ... by not putting up a defence ... just by trying to endure it</p>
<p>the high risk being that I will not bring up enough endurance to suffer the torturers and my whims of pain experienced might be of such delight to the torturers that my willingness to allow them torture me might not satisfy them enough but them asking for more self surrendering victims to torture</p>
<p>therefore my self-sacrifice would not have helped at all but made it all worse, fuel the torturers addiction to dominate and massacre others</p>
<p>mmmh... what happens when I try to apply these thinking patterns towards the situation where the attacker, the mobber, the dominator wants the victim to wear a mask or get a vaccine</p>
<p>if I try now to imagine myself going along with this suggested</p>
<p>taking one for the team</p>
<p>something like ... although my immune system is fully capable of handling the informations what the coronavirus and every other virus and bacteria strain is contributing for my personal growth</p>
<p>a theoretical me ... not the real me ... just for the sake of this thought experiment ... a theoretical me would agree to all the social distancing, mask wearing, contact and trace, voluntarily self-isolation, quarantine and yes even to get an injection of this vaccine what is being advertised as the only way how we ever get back to a normal life</p>
<p>just for the sake of giving the attacker, the dominator, the empire, the satisfaction of having broken my spirit, having broken my resistance, having annihilated my wish to choose</p>
<p>the theoretical  outcome of such a voluntary self-submission, such a surrender to every measure any authoritarian centralistic governement would want me to follow ... taking any future vaccine they might cook up ... supporting any self-bondage, self-restricting, stay-at-home lockdown period they will ever want me to endure in the next 40 or 50 years of my life</p>
<p>buying all the products being advertised on television and just basically do everything what all the governement channels would  suggest</p>
<p>mmmh... but would it really change something ... would the world become a better place if I would just agree with all the abuse ? perhaps I am too stupid at this moment ... but I do not see that possibility</p>
<p>I just see myself vaccinated reading the latest fear inducing news</p>
<p>my head filled with ... oh have I missed the latest forecast how I can satisfy the all-knowing-governements wishes ... how I can serve them by not listening to my inner intuition but listening to their plans what they have strategically planned for my future</p>
<p>uuuh... that hurts ... I mean ... that really is a picture of myself I would rather not paint some more</p>
<p>so its time to end this thought experiment with me saying</p>
<p>no, I am not taking the vaccine ... no, I do not agree with governements using emergency law to restrict peoples freedom to move and assemble ... no, I do not agree with governements using emergency law to demand of people wearing a mask what hinders the free flow of air in and out of the body ... no, I do not agree with governements using emergency law to demand anyone being tested for anything</p>
<p>because I do not believe that such a governement does have the best interest of people in its plans ... if it for example never asks the people if they would agree with these dictatorial tyrannical restrictions of freedoms to move and assemble, to wear however much or little clothes they want and to decide if and when yes, what kind of medical treatment they would want</p>
<p>basically ...</p>
<p>I do believe that emergency law is really bad</p>
<p>and would best be abolished</p>
<p>and  on top of all this ... central governements too would best be dissolved along with all the political hierarchies</p>
<p>but how could this all happen in a peaceful, organised, non-violent way</p>
<p>how could we as the people who live beside each other as neighbours ... create a societal structure, a political structure what would have no emergency laws, where no central dictatorships would be possible ?</p>
<p>I see the possibility to prepare a fair and sustainable political structure via the renewal of the regional state constitutions and the nation state constitutions</p>
<p>using concepts like</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>once such a decentralisation would have happened ... I believe the circle of equals in a local community what is its own sovereign ... would come together to find a consensus, how can we best support each others freedom of choice so that we get strong and trust in our inner ability to heal all what ails usa consensus being a path what agrees with everyone or at least no one has any objections to it ... and if that would be too tiresome, too demanding to find, at least a 60 percent qualified majority vote could be aspired as to create rules what have the greatest possible support within the local community</p>
<p>when people have the possibility to engage in real world matters, when the hierarchies have been dissolved and everything what matters is who is here and now, how are we going to find an agreement between each other what suits everyone ...</p>
<p>I believe problems will be solved very quickly without violence ... just by taking the time to listen to everyone and trying to incorporate everyones concerns into the sollution</p>
<p>its not left against right or right against left</p>
<p>its about dissolving the up and down ... getting rid of the feudal structures</p>
<p>king gives power to feudal families what set the rules for the towns/regions they are dominating</p>
<p>today the king is the national parliamentary assembly what sets the rules for the regional states( which replaced the feudal families ) and then the regional state again sets the rules for the local community</p>
<p>by simply dissolving this hierarchy and shifting all political powers to the local community ...</p>
<p>by dissolving both the national parliamentary assembly and the regional parliamentary assembly so that only the full assembly of all local residents of a local community remains as the only place where the law is made</p>
<p>the circle of all who are each others neighbours ... create the laws what are valid in this neighbourhood</p>
<p>it is so simple</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the moment we choose someone else to make the law for us ... we are fucked</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the moment we say ... no more representatives no more ... no more electing other people to make the law ... now we want to create the law what we are willing to live with in the circle of all human beings who live here and now as permanent residents  </p>
<p>from this moment onwards we unfuck ourselves but engage in respectfull dialog looking each other in the eyes at the same level</p>
<p>knowing that this here and now, this meeting of all who are concerned about a topic is the only <br>
time and space where we decide what is going to happen in the future within our local community   </p>
<p>all who are living here in this local community as permanent residents, every child, youth and adult who lives permanently here and now having the very same weighted political power to vote on what we are going to do to solve a challenge what has arisen in our midst... how we are going to live with and beside each other on a daily basis so that everyones needs are covered, so everyone is free to do as one feels it being suitable for oneself and this very freedom of choice the most precious contribution to the local community overall mental/ emotional harmony</p></p>

        <p>they know where I live, its very easy actually to find me, switzerland is so small, and I helped them a lot by posting so many pictures on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mayloveheal/photos">https://www.facebook.com/mayloveheal/photos</a><br>
I do almost all my uploading of stuff, writings, visiting websites on a standard webbrowser from a laptop connected to the local cable network, so my ip-adress is super easy to locate</p>
<p>but they are not really interested to make me into a martyr ... more the opposite ... wait until I give up writing and nobody will possibly pick up the idea</p>
<p>also I don't think that anything can be done to me on a legal level ... I am not asking anyone to hurt anyone ... in fact I am doing the opposite ... I am talking to my fellow human beings asking them to consider the possibility of renewing the very basic contract what is the foundation of our living together ... our state constitutions ...</p>
<p>and this thing is a global topic</p>
<p>most every regional state and nation state  constitutions all over the planet have these hierarchical structures inbuilt what almost allways result in people getting elected who are corrupt and do what the ones want who gave the most money to their election campaigns or if they are allready rich they misuse their time in governement service to enrich themselves and their fellow billionaires some more ... on the expense of social and ecological fairness</p>
<p>this very simple thing I am proposing ... to do away with the national parliamentary assembly and the regional parliamentary assembly ... to shift all political powers to the local community so it may create its own local law valid on its territory ... this very simple proposal has the power to eliminate all corruption</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>about idolising ... I have written so much  ... <a href="https://archive.org/details/apatm">archive.org/details/apatm</a> ... about my own life ... so many shortcomings have I revealed of myself, that It will be hard for many people to find me being the super example</p>
