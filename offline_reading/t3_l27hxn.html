<title>If you haven't already, I urge you to invest in hard copies of books and other forms of media. We now live in a world where people are re-writing definitions of words like "herd immunity." Who knows when they will start editing content out of our books?</title>

    <strong>If you haven't already, I urge you to invest in hard copies of books and other forms of media. We now live in a world where people are re-writing definitions of words like "herd immunity." Who knows when they will start editing content out of our books?</strong>
    <p><p>The power has been mysteriously going out every couple days at my house for no reason. These outages range from an hour to more than a day, and have been affecting everyone in my area. </p>
<p>Having the power keep cutting out has made me realize how reliant I have become on my laptop to consume information. I don't just use my laptop to access websites like Reddit or YouTube, I also use it to download and read PDF books online.</p>
<p>I already have a lot of my favorite books in hard copies, but during the outages I started thinking about all the books I wouldn't be able to access on my laptop if the power never went back on.</p>
<p>Then I began to think about how the POTUS got banned off of every major social media platform. I have also seen YouTube change the like to dislike ratio on videos about the Inauguration to make it seem more positive. </p>
<p>But the biggest thing I'm concerned about is that the WHO changed their definition of "herd immunity." They now gaslight anyone who claims that they did this but if you look online you can find numerous examples of the previous definition.</p>
<p>So I felt compelled to make a post on here to all my NNN friends and tell you that if you aren't collecting information in hard copies already, please start doing so.</p>
<p>Major corporations like Amazon have already established Kindle readers (kindle, as in fire, as in burning books) that are super popular. I know a lot of you are probably like me and read a lot online.</p>
<p>You never know when they will start editing information out of books, when history books will miraculously start to change. </p>
<p>Another thing that concerns me is that education is still predominantly online. Now kids are relying on online material to learn. When the power kept going out at my house, I realized I couldn't access ANY of my online coursework for school. I had nothing to show for my work, and nothing to reference back to if I wanted to refer to something I'd learned.</p>
<p>You don't have to spend tons of money, either. There's tons of great thrift shops that sell books nowadays. I've bought most of my books in thrift stores because they're way cheaper. If you don't have a local one, you can go to <a href="https://thriftbooks.com">thriftbooks.com</a>, which sells most books for very cheap. They ship fast, too. </p>
<p><strong>TDLR; My point is that information is being edited nowadays, and we can't trust the Internet to be a place where things are permanent anymore. Buy books now, so even if you just put them in a box in your closet and don't read them, you still have access to information and nobody can take that away from you.</strong></p></p>

        <p>This sounds kind of alarmist but you’re definitely not wrong. That’s the problem with all digital media. Someone can make it disappear on a whim. Also you don’t “own” anything digital. You just rent it from the rights holders. </p>
<p>That’s why I collect physical movies. They’ve already started censoring several old movies. This really should be more of an issue than people realize. The basis of any successful free society is free and open discourse.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, sorry if it came across as alarmist. To be honest, though, I hope that this post always seems alarmist so nothing I said ever makes a difference. The day this isn't alarmist is the day that they actually do start banning certain books and we can't get access to old info. </p>
<p>It's cool you collect physical movies! If you don't mind me asking, which old movies have they censored? I didn't realize that was something that was happening!</p>

        <p>Another one is the Trump scene in Home Alone 2. There's been talk about removing it, but I don't know if they actually will. Better to just have a hard copy.</p>

        <p>South Park has several episodes that aren’t on any streaming platform, and I’d argue those are the most important episodes, with very real messages.  Netflix removed an episode of Community, one of its highest rated episodes, because of black face.  But if you actually watch the episode, it’s not black face at all.  They say so in the dialogue.  Tropic Thunder features Robert Downey Jr in black face, the blu ray is out of print and it’s very hard to find a copy these days.  Those are just a few examples I’m aware of.</p>

        <p>&rt;Tropic Thunder features Robert Downey Jr in black face</p>
<p>I just want to clarify that his "blackface" is actual satirizing the use of blackface in Hollywood. To a person who truly believes in civil rights and not just the superficial optics of woke politics, it is hilarious.</p>

        <p>God, that gone with the wind thing bothers me so much. It’s like a textbook lost cause mythology piece of media, and as someone going to school so I can just talk about the civil war with some degree of authority, it really gets to me that it’s being censored. It is a very very poor, very racist depiction of the south. In modern discourse, that’s the damn point. It’s a prime example of the south “winning” the propaganda war (as opposed to the north winning the actual war). UGH.</p>

        <p>People used to scoff at me because I insisted on reading proper books with pages I can turn with my fingers instead of those little e-reader devices but they're eating their words now. That EULA you skimmed through? It means exactly what it says. License agreement. As in at any time they can just up and delete the whole thing if they decide they don't want you reading it, or just quietly edit bits and pieces of it as their whims dictate.</p>

        <p>Not only that, but also with music.  I’m very protective of my music collection and still have a full shelf of cds.  iTunes over the years have made it more and more Duffy to implement physical cds onto an iPhone.  They want you to buy from them or subscribe to their music streaming service.  But I have a handful of obscure music that Apple doesn’t have.  Every year, they find a new way to fuck us.</p>

        <p>I've been feeling a little nihilistic the last few days thinking about how much of our knowledge and culture as a civilization will be forever lost to history because of digitalization. You ever hear of bit rot? Even assuming the formats don't change to something that doesn't have backwards compability the medium is so fragile that it can be rendered unreadable in as little as 20 years just from sitting around and going through ordinary changes in heat and moisture. The other week I tried to boot up the old copy I had lying around of Command and Conquer Red Alert 2 because when I was 12 that was all I did when school and friends weren't taking up my time. It crashed repeatedly. Disc wasn't even scratched. Go a few years back before then and you have 3.5" floppy disks, 7" actually floppy disks, microfiche, various videogame cartridge types, cassette tapes, all the rest. The last 2 decades of the 20th century will be a complete black hole to archeologists of future centuries. Records still hold up though, even if the hipsters didn't make a whole thing about vinyl being the superior audio format LPs are a much more robust format than CDs and don't have the aforementioned issues of clouds and streaming services. And all the things we've ever written online - that disappears pretty quickly too. The big tech firms have stuck around for a while compared to their cannibalized predecessors but we're talking about it in 21st century terms, Facebook is practically permanent by post-modern standards and it was founded in 2004. And they're notorious for filtering and censoring everything that goes on there. Paper is where it's at. Paper you can hold in your hands. It's real. Although ever since the mills started bleaching paper and we found out it dissolves the ink we've had a tough time keeping original copies intact from the 1850s to present so maybe our Bit Rot worries aren't a new phenomenon. Just new by today's standards. I mean shit the Pyramids took generations to build and here we are thinking that what happened just last year is ancient history. February 2020 we were all hitting the gyms and going to our offices and having people over for parties and it never once occurred to anybody that grocery shopping was something somehow dangerous. Get me off this planet it's spinning too fast...</p>

        <p>Ha I’m the same way. I still have a large cd collection and I have it all saved in multiple formats on multiple hard drives. I used to be a big iTunes guy back before they switched over to streaming. Now I literally never use the program! </p>
<p>Anyways, physical media isn’t going away entirely. There will always be people like us who make sure this stuff gets passed on to the next generation.</p>

        <p>I remember when I was watching the inauguration yesterday thinking how predictable it was that the comments on YouTube were turned off on every single livestream channel I checked. Why wouldn't a legitimately elected president of a democratic country want to hear what the people have to say? For that matter why was it such a scandal when a few of his opponents "broke into Congress" when it's a building THEY paid for to host meetings of people THEY chose to represent them? Have Congress meetings always been closed to the general public. This is pretty fucked up. What happened to transparency? Some random woman is facing years in jail for stealing Pelosi's laptop and trying to sell it. Why are the contents of that laptop a secret in the first place? American taxpayers paid for that laptop. Its contents are public property. I'm not saying random people should be looking over her shoulder at all times to see what she's writing on it but the activities of public officials elected and paid by the public should be accessible to the public. Maybe she's on the group chat asking everyone what they want to order for lunch or she's posting memes on 4chan. Fuck knows. But the dealings of government should be public knowledge. People shouldn't have to break in to their offices and steal their computers to know what they're up to.</p>

        <p>There was a hilarious compilation video Biden saying racist and dumb things that fb deleted I wish I saved. I knew they'd do it but it's still sick that they would delete a video of Biden saying stuff with his own words.  I'm constantly saving stuff lately.  That video was really long I hope I find it again so I can save it.  This is so sketch I might even need to move the stuff to a flash drive instead of my phone.  They also keep deleting the video of the pcr guy calling out fauci.  This is legit sick what they are doing we are in immediate danger for how brazen they are.</p>

        <p>This is really important. I'm glad you posted this. There is definitely potential for ebooks to be edited. I don't think it's happened yet on a large scale, but the potential is there. </p>
<p>One thing I've noticed is that a lot of libraries have been getting rid of books to make more space for chairs and computers and manga sections. People never check out the old books, so why keep them? Libraries have always replaced old books with newer copies, but it seems to be happening at a faster rate these days. </p>
<p>Also, a lot of people use wikipedia for almost everything. They say they use the references wikipedia provides, but I really doubt it. I like to read history, and I've read about events that wikipedia doesn't have articles on (at least in English). I'm waiting for the day when people will tell me something is false, because it's not on wikipedia. Luckily it hasn't happened yet.</p>

        <p>Hey not to go down the rabbit hole here but a few weeks ago an Internet outage happened that affected all of southern Ontario and at least 2 ISPs I'm aware of.  Then it happened again to one ISP a little while later.  There was never any explanation as to what had happened.  Can't ever recall anything like that happening before.  I know ISPs can use the same infrastructure but it was just strange.</p>

        <p>Second best option, for those of you who can, is to hold all ebooks/PDFs on a computer of some kind that is completely disconnected from the Internet. Hell, could even be text files stored on a USB that can be accessed with some sort of jury-rigged PC run with a Raspberry Pi.</p>

        <p>Just download software to download entire websites. The power is never going out permanently I can promise you that. Can't surveil the populace without power and there are generators and solar chargers as well.</p>
<p>But you are right about building a physical library,  especially for extremely controversial books. Even if the internet is shutdown , the information doesn't disappear. Get a faraday cage if you are concerned with EMP.</p>

        <p>That's why I still own DVDs. Fucking who knows when they'll decide to reedit every film and TV show in history to adhere to the standards of the new normal and digitally distance and mask up every actor on screen.</p>

        <p>The only thing I buy digitally is pc games, and that's only because physical copies aren't generally available anymore. When they are,  you still have to download the game instead of installing from the disc.</p>

        <p>Maybe the power keeps going out because the CDC and Biden have realised that you’ve got it all figured out. I’d grab your bug out bag and hit the road if I were you. There’s definitely government assets on their way to “take care of you” in their re-education camps. I know this is the case as I have inside information from the fbi, cia and nsa, but the fact that you figured it out on your own means you’re in grave danger. Act now!!!</p>
