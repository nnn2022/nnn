    <strong>I can't believe these people are convinced they are the sane ones.</strong>
    <p><p>Grocery store today. Lady ahead of me in the express checkout line is wearing two masks, surgical gloves, a face shield, and goggles. She turns around and notices me (I'm wearing a simple neck gaiter). She becomes visibly frightened, even through all the layers of anti-COVID armor she is wearing, and says, "Those aren't real masks. They spread more germs than not wearing a mask."</p>
<p>I cross my arms and give off the coldest stare I can muster. </p>
<p>"Please, wear a cloth mask or else you could get everyone sick."</p>
<p>I shift my head down and let the neck gaiter slip under my nose, then continue staring. She panics and moves a few steps forward, peeking over her shoulder a few times to see if I'm getting closer. She speaks again,</p>
<p>"Please, pull it up!"</p>
<p>I tilt my head again and let it drop further, exposing my upper lip. She jumps out of the express checkout and speedwalks to the regular checkout.</p>
<p>And these people are convinced that we are the crazy ones. Yeah, lady, there's a super deadly virus that can kill you if someone not wearing a mask so much as takes one sniff of the air, even if you're wearing more protective gear than a bomb disposal tech. If you're that afraid of COVID, why even go out in the first place?</p></p>

<p>I for one am not out actively looking for covid, but I’m also not letting it control my life. </p>
<p>Bottom line: if you are sick or high risk stay home.  If you are scared stay home.</p>

        <p>It’s terrible how people think they know the science. Cloth masks do nothing or are harmful. </p>

<p>Btw, my sister and I had a conversation about this. She’s a doomer but has a family member with a serious immune system issue. So I give her a pass except when she wants to discuss the science. I have a liberal arts degree from a state university. I’m not exactly a rocket scientist. That being said, she has an associates degree from a small community college. She has never taken a college level science class.</p>

        <p>See, if people bothered to get a bit educated there wouldn't be such reactions and this whole COVID facade would be down already. There's millions of viruses in the air, surfaces, water, and even inside your body, on your skin, etc. It's impossible to avoid them, even if you pretend to be an astronaut. Fortunately our immune system provides protection against all those, which is why we as a species are even alive at all.</p>
<p>The question to ask all those people who support the lockdowns, etc. is simple: Why now, and not any other year which STILL had all the millions of viruses floating around?</p>

<p>Over the next 4 weeks, they'll begin to play up the new mutant strain, and it'll lead to more restrictions. They've already set this narrative up quite well.</p>

        <p>Because throughout my life I've never caught anything in public that wasn't more than a mild inconvenience for a few days, that is if I even caught anything because the transmission rate of all the other stuff is so low. </p>
<p>Whereas this virus is very contagious, has potentially long lasting effects and can have severe short term effects. I know young healthy people who have died from it, others who still don't have their sense of taste or smell and some of my friends work in hospitals so I know directly from them the dire situation on covid wards. </p>
<p>Granted I'm not worried about my health, I don't want to catch it and pass it onto someone else who would be more vulnerable. Wearing a mask and social distancing is the least you can do for basically minimal effort. Sure lockdowns suck but we would be past it if selfish assholes took it more seriously earlier. </p>
<p>I'm not saying to 100% stick to the rules because no one does or can, but be reasonable. </p>
<p>You tell others to get educated but it seems you're the one without any critical thinking skills.</p>

You've never been hospitalized with complications from a respiratory infection. You, unlike my parents, didn't catch the flu last January and suffer from post-viral syndrome. </p>

        <p>This is not more contagious than other viruses out there and certainly not more deadly. </p>
<p>And even if it is contagious and deadly, why would you trust a fucking loose fitting thin mask to save you?  If it’s so deadly and so contagious, a mask won’t do shit and you know it.  I wish for once, you Sooners would be honest!  If you honestly believe this virus will kill you and spreads more easily than any virus in the history of this planet, you would never go out in public.  So stop lying and fess up!!!!</p>
<p>And influenza kills hundreds of thousands every fucking year including young children and healthy adults so stop trying to pretend otherwise. We have a hundred years of proof and history on the flu that will prove you wrong.</p>

        <p>Its all about assessed risk, I don't think we'll all drop dead from contacting it but what the fuck is the problem with trying to minimise it? I don't wear masks for myself, I do it for others as they're a trivial inconvenience at most and actually quite nice to wear in the winter. They stop droplets, even if they reduce spread by only 10% (not a stat, just giving an example) I'd still rather have a 10% lower chance of infecting someone else as I'm not a selfish prick. I still go out where appropriate but seeing people having huge parties (support bubbles while not ideal are essential for people's mental health so they're ok) and running around carelessly without masks makes me think they're fucking selfish morons.</p>

<p>That's all.  None of us here are afraid of a respiratory virus.  We're not.  None of us all and YOU KNOW THAT.  We're not afraid of it.</p>

        <p>Honestly I try my best to accommodate on the mask issue.  I keep a surgical mask in my pocket and wear it at any place that specifies its needed.  If someone approached me to put it on I'll do so to keep them happy.  The last thing I need is for my employer to see a video taken by some unhinged dingbat accusing me of being unsafe.</p>

        <p>That woman was comically excessive in her caution, sure, but that doesn't mean you gotta do that to her. You have your personal freedoms and shit and I'll fight to protect that, but like why? What's the point of taking your pseudo-mask down?</p>

I'm not a doomer I joined this sub because I think the government is being tyrannical with its abuse of power, but at the same time I think covid is real and people should take reasonable precautions.
Hopefully this sub can become an open discussion to prevent a new normal</p>

        <p>You're putting words in my mouth. Because I agree with a lot of what this sub is about but disagree with some. Why should this sub just be one coherent opinion? Would you leave if the sub changed slightly away from yours? And would you really like to have an echo chamber like doomers?</p>

        <p>Even though you're a troll I agree, half wearing a mask is pathetic and asking for busy bodies to get involved because you are signalling to them that you are part of their cult.</p>
<p>You need to just never wear one and walk around like you are unhinged and people leave you alone.</p>

        <p>He was ignoring her. He did so even after her first outburst. She continued to be an ass, so he allowed gravity to solve his problem.</p>
<p>For him to actually be an ass, he would have had to speak to her, or argue with her, or approach her, or pull his mask off around her. He did none of those things.</p>
