    <strong>COVID spreads through droplets and as of a few days ago... aerosols.</strong>
    <p><p>Well it looks like the WHO finally came out and admitted that COVID does not just spread through droplets as claimed for over a year now. (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2021/05/04/who-coronavirus-airborne/amp/) Here is an article with some quick details. </p>
<p>So what does this mean and why do we care, like, at all?</p>
<p>Well we finally have a mainstream reason to defy cloth mask mandates. Lets take a look at some standard airborne precautions currently practiced in medicine: (https://www.health.state.mn.us/facilities/patientsafety/infectioncontrol/pre/airborne.html) (https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Infectious-Diseases/Flu/Airborne-Precautions)</p>
<p>Both of the links above have some key notes that need to be made clear: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We are moving away from simply taking precautions against respiratory droplets which are known to fall straight to the ground and could project about 6 ft via cough/sneeze/speaking. Lets talk about airborne droplets. Airborne droplet nuclei (small-particles [5 micrograms or smaller] of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) or
dust particles that contain an infectious agent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the minimum precautions for airborne diseases? I can tell you from experience its much more strict than simply throwing cloth over your face and staying 6 ft apart. Lets look at what the sources say: Microorganisms carried by the airborne route can be widely dispersed by air currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host in the same room or over a long distance form the source patient ‚Äì depending on environmental factors such as temperature and ventilation. So how do we protect ourselves? N95 respirator
Prior fit-testing that must be repeated annually and fit-check / seal-check prior to each use.
or powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR). As a quick note for any brigadiers from r/coronavirus - here is a link from your favorite source, the CDC, advising the same precautions: (https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/basics/transmission-based-precautions.html)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the governments of the world want to continue the facade that cloth masks do anything now, they would have a lot of explaining to do. Saying, ‚Äúcloth masks are better than nothing‚Äù now no longer applies. Because its not just droplets we‚Äôre worried about now. Aerosols can only be stopped by respirators, and even those are not 100% without strict fittings and policies policing mask touching or adjusting.</p></p>

        <p>We have know for many years that respiratory viruses spread via aerosols i.e. it's airborne.  The droplet narrative is designed to shore up the mask "narrative".</p>

        <p>Right, its about time they came out and admitted that covid travels on particle too small for transmission to be stopped by cloth masks.</p>

        <p>I work in hospitals and part of my job is to inspect equipment in every single patient room in the facility. Rooms with droplet precaution require me to wear a mask, gown, and gloves. </p>
<p>Airborne precaution rooms can only be entered through an ante room so there's no direct access from the room to the hallway, and I'm not even personally allowed to go into them. Only nurses/doctors who are wearing essentially a hazmat suit are allowed in.</p>

        <p>Covid attaches to air particles. If you can breathe in through your mask, you can breathe in covid. Maybe we should just get rid of breathing entirely.</p>
