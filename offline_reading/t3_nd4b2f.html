    <strong>Went out and about today. Almost everybody was maskless. It was beautiful.</strong>
    <p><p>I went to my local Flea Market that was closed last year and it was amazing. Only a few people wore masks and a few people didnâ€™t. Granted, the CDC gave them permission to but our governorâ€™s a cunt because we canâ€™t go maskless until May 24th, but only a few people were wearing masks. I definitely wasnâ€™t. Yes itâ€™s kind of cheap that I waited until now to finally go maskless but at the same time it felt nice. I felt free. Of course I was afraid of people bitching at me but nobody gave a fuck. Lmao I canâ€™t wait until this is not a big deal anymore. If vaccinated people can be free then unvaccinated people should be able to as well. Plus I was mostly outside so there was no way in hell that I was masking up. The unfortunate part is my allergies were acting up, but it felt nice to have things back to normal again.</p></p>

        <p>Isn't it suspicious that comments like yours and /u/ceruleanrain87 are always downvoted whenever they said their locations still have mask nazis. That, and how many people claim everything/everywhere is "completely maskless". It's such bullshit gaslighting, and I swear, these people are either shills or trolls.</p>
<p>For real, think about it. If everything/everywhere is basically back to normal, then what's the point of this sub? What are we fighting against?</p>

        <p>Yeah we're getting left behind over here lol. I just got an email saying we're now allowed to be in "orange tier" so the apartment pool will still be reservation only, but now we can use our fob key! Without checking in and signing the medical paper! This is so beyond dumb, I've been in this apartment for 2 years and didn't even know the fob key was the pool key, and I've gotten to use the pool one time because the 1 household reservations are so competitive. </p>
<p>I asked my boss to transfer to Texas but at this point, give me Louisiana if that's where there's an opening, I really don't care anymore ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜– at least I'd probably save a lot of money lol</p>
