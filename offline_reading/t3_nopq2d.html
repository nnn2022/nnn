    <strong>The True Cause of this Horror</strong>
    <p><p>Among those who oppose the lockdowns I have noticed two camps. </p>
<p>The first camp is those of you who believe that the lockdowns represent an orchestrated plot. For you, the harms caused by the lockdown are not collateral damage; they are its intended effects. It seems to you that it cannot be that the lockdowns “just so happened” to have the effect of shuttering churches, encouraging us to hate and fear each other, denying basic human contact, increasing human weakness, and massive upward transfer of wealth, all by pure coincidence. To you, this has all the marks of a plan. </p>
<p>But you can’t help but doubt, sometimes. For this idea seems to impute to our elites level of competency, indeed brilliance, they have never come even close to showing before: indeed, that arguably no set of elites in human history have ever shown. Moreover, the motives that would be needed to perpetuate something like this seem so dark as to be nearly inexplicable. History has had many really wicked people in power, but the bad guy’s motivations generally make sense: there’s always some (usually illusory) good motivating all the crimes. This, though, almost appears to take human suffering not merely as a means to some selfish end, but as an end in itself. Not merely evil, but inhuman in the most literal sense of the word. </p>
<p>The second camp is those of you who see the crisis not as a result of conspiracy, but simply a series of selfish desires and incompetence coming together to create a perfect storm. For you, a conspiracy is not needed to explain what ordinary human motives can explain. People are afraid, so they don’t think rationally. They clamor for mask mandates and the politicians oblige. Elites have never liked churches so of course they’ll see them as inessential. Vaccines get rushed because people are scared and too proud to entertain the idea that we can’t stop the spread. Demonizing all critics is just standard politics these days. The Great Reset is only a new brand name for the same solution the left proposes to literally every problem. You know there’s some corruption going on of course, but don’t see a grand plan coordinated by a secret cabal. </p>
<p>But you can’t help but doubt, too. Though each individual aspect of this debacle can be explained in terms of ordinary human weakness, it seems curious that all these human weaknesses just so happened to come together in the way they did. Is it really a coincidence that the selfish motives of politicians, doctors, media, and regular people all just happen to have combined into something that <em>looks</em> as though it was engineered by someone who wants human suffering and strife for its own sake? </p>
<p>In a way, both camps are right, but missing the final piece of the puzzle. What we are witnessing is probably the most definitive piece of historical evidence that you will ever see for the existence of the Devil. </p>
<p>We have the all the appearances of a deliberate design to turn people against each other and further away from God, yet each individual piece of this disaster is executed by some individual acting on an entirely commonplace selfish motive or character flaw. </p>
<p>That’s how the Devil works: to whatever extent you are attached to sin, he has a foothold in you and will use you by playing on your faults. </p>
<p>The sooner we all understand the real nature of what we’re up against, the sooner we can start <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p7.htm">fighting back properly.</a></p>
<p>(Of course it’s <em>possible</em> that some of those causing these problems are on the Devil’s side consciously, but the Devil has historically done some of his best work through people that had no concept of him at all, so this is not necessary to posit.)</p></p>

        <p>&rt;This, though, almost appears to take human suffering not merely as ameans to some selfish end, but as an end in itself. Not merely evil, butinhuman in the most literal sense of the word.</p>
<p>Have you ever read about the archons?  It's this. They subjugate civiliizations and force the inhabitants to live in a constant state of fear, pain, suffering, hate, wars, resentment, jealousy, and anger.  Call it demonic, the devil, reptilians, super evil human pieces of pure filth - whatever you wish - but human suffering <em>is</em> the end in itself in these scenarios. They feed off the negative energy produced through suffering.</p>

        <p>Of course this is Luciferian. Wanting to kill 7 out of every 8 people currently living will always be Satanic.</p>
<p>If you have read the book Blood Drinking, Cannibalism and High Adept Satanism by Kerth Barker you will understand the exact layers of this Luciferian agenda. At the highest rungs of Satanism, as stated in the book, the goal is MASS MIND CONTROL. They do not practice the lower forms of Satanism. All of that behavior is simply to compromise people completely and totally so that they will do what they are told.</p>
<p>The level of mind control on display currently, around the world, is proof positive that the High Adept Satanists have their hands firmly around much of humanity. This book is a must read for any wanting to truly understand what's going on at the moment and this includes the bizarre movement to normalize transvestites.</p>
