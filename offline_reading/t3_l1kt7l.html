        <p>This. That's been the most frustrating thing with doomers, both online and off, is how when you disagree with their politics they immediately assume you're an extremist on the other end of the political spectrum. My dad, for example, called me a 'Trumpie' because I don't think mainstream media is a good news source and that I don't think lockdown restrictions are working. Someone online today called me a "flat earther/moon landing denier" and said "let me guess, you think the vaccine has microchips in it" all because I said I don't think the government is being transparent. </p>
<p>Like, it's insane how quickly people will jump down your throat and make up shit to try and dismiss you, all over the mildest disagreements.</p>

        <p>Can you explain why you don't think lockdown restrictions are working? It's pretty self explanatory. People don't go outside, the virus doesn't spread. The reason it isn't working is because nobody is listening and going outside anyways.</p>

<p>Your plan of lockdown calls for a unrealistic goal of 100 percent compliance. We have data of places who have had longer and stricter lockdowns than others that didn’t yet they still had higher deaths.</p>
<p>Lockdowns weren’t meant to last almost a year. And deal massive collateral damage to the working class but I get it. It’s okay to fuck us over in the name of safety. Just don’t be surprised that a lot of us have stopped caring about the safety and well being of those who are fine with destroying our livelihoods so they can feel safe and secure</p>

        <p>In theory yeah if no one went out then it wouldn't spread. But what you're neglecting here is only "non-essential stuff" is closed during a lockdown - at least in my area. Essential workplaces are still open, and in some places so are schools and... Well... <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/more-than-400-covid-19-cases-at-amazon-warehouses-in-ontario-amid-concern-about-industrial-spread-of-virus">For industrial essential workplaces that's not really a good place for mitigating COVID spread</a>. </p>
<p>Then you have these infected essential workers then going to grocery stores, drug stores and any other essential stores and spreading COVID to people there. </p>
<p>So that's why they don't work. The restrictions don't target the places where COVID actually does spread.</p>

        <p>Because the media and pro-lockdown doomers scapegoat 'selfish people' and 'anti-maskers' as the entire reason this pandemic persists, and many people genuinely believe that. The person I replied to is a perfect example... I don't think it has even crossed their mind that COVID has spread in essential workplaces, nevermind that essential workplaces are the main spreading vector of this virus. And they're not alone, <em>tonssssss</em> of people think this way. </p>

<p>We do not want the government to work harder; we want it to leave us the hell alone so that we can make our own decisions about whether the risk of COVID is worth throwing away everything that makes life worth living. </p>

<p>Bombs are a clear-and-present danger; healthy people are not. It is actually more like the British government saying "Everyone stay in their homes for a year, with blackout curtains, because the Germans might show up at any time." Or it is like demanding that people in the countryside of North England, which is not being bombed, must also put up blackout curtains and stay hidden, just because the people in London are at risk. People would not have obeyed those orders. </p>
<p>If you want to make a case that sick people need to quarantine, I'd listen. However, quarantining healthy people just because you cannot accept your own mortality is foolish and tyrannical</p>
<p>&rt;You’re upset that your shitty actions did in fact lead to longer COVID restrictions.</p>
<p>Nonsense. The restrictions are based 100% on the lust for power of our leaders and the willingness of a critical mass of cowards to go along with it. Nothing that I can do to stop them, except ignore them and hope that enough people go along. You don't get the boot off your neck by licking it hard enough. In fact, people like you are the ones who have made this last so long. If you, and everyone like you, stopped obeying the orders, they'd be gone tomorrow.</p>
<p>&rt; you’ve decided to do a skinner and go “no, it is the medical professionals who are wrong”.</p>
<p>Which professionals? Some say one thing; some say another. Science is not religion; it is not an orthodox set of beliefs that everyone must chant in unison.</p>
<p>&rt;Stop acting as if this was the best you could’ve done. Selfish people are the reason it failed, not the policies itself</p>
<p>It is not the best I could have done, and I never pretended that it is. I should have disobeyed the orders sooner instead of obeying them from March to May. I naively believed, as you do now, that if I just grin and bear it, it would all be over sooner. That is a lie; it always has been a lie.</p>

        <p>Yup, the MSM is the biggest problem &amp; danger in the country.</p>
<p>Am I the only one that finds the timing of this "pandemic" suspect?</p>
<p>100 years since the last one, Trump's riding a fairly comfortable                                     economic/political wave, it's an election year, nationwide protests &amp; riots spawn and all but ignored by the MSM , blue state lockdowns are more prevalent and longer lasting, highly questionable ties between presidential candidate/elect and Covid country of origin, questionable election goes to aforementioned candidate, protests and rioting quietly vanish...</p>
<p>I'm sure I left something out and it may not be chronologically correct but don't bother to challenging me  on something, as I'm not interested.  I'm throwing it out there as a whole to see if it should actually be thrown out forever or considered.  It just seems like a lot of "one off" situations in the same, somewhat significant year.</p>

        <p>And of course the school shooting epidemic somehow disappeared. Every other year there's a school shooting every single day, each one bloodier than the last, followed predictably by the politicians screeching demands that everyone surrender their guns and make school shootings illegal. Somehow this past year there hasn't been a single one. Hmmmm. Maybe all the school shooters cleaned up their act?</p>

        <p>Your shill is showing.</p>
<p>It takes a MINIMUM of 6 YEARS to properly take a conventional vaccine through clinical trials before they even reach the baseline requirement to start the FDA approval process and enter phase 3 of human testing.</p>
<p>You’re going to tell me, that in less than a year, we’ve developed, properly tested through true double blind, controlled studies, that what we are about to inject into millions of people is absolutely safe long-term? ESP considering that the est IFR of COVID is approx 99.97% (meaning estimated infections, not confirmed cases, two very different things) and the est efficacy of the vaccine is 95%, meaning if you’re a healthy individual this vaccine is actually LESS effective than your own immune system. </p>
<p>This vaccine hasn’t been tested on pregnant women, those who are breastfeeding, those with autoimmune diseases, etc etc... there are reports coming out of people dying from the vaccine, or having severe complications from the vaccine. </p>
<p>Asking questions isn’t denying science you fucking smooth brain. People have a right to choose what they put into their bodies especially when the industry that’s behind what you’re consuming is intrinsically corrupt and has paid out billions upon billions of settlements in and out of court because they gave more fucks about shareholder dividends then ensuring what they sold to their consumers was safe.</p>

        <p>It takes a minimum of 6 years to develop and test a vaccine because it's hard to find funding, volunteers, and resources, and because it has to go through the channels waiting for it's turn like any other medication.</p>
<p>Now, this vaccine had none of those limitations. Many volunteered and many of them actually got COVID during their trial so they were able to check its effects quite quickly.</p>
<p>Plus, as soon as the vaccine results were ready, they were reviewed within a few days because they were put ahead of all other medication to be reviewed, instead of waiting for months.</p>
<p>I'd like to see which actual official steps you think they skipped.</p>
<p>As your argument about vaccine vs immune system, it's a false equivalence. The percentage you talk about is the percentage of people dying, not getting it. It gets worse with older people and people with preexisting conditions, and it doesn't take into account the people who get it and survive with lifetime effects, and all the people who actually go to the hospital to survive. Sure, you and meet may have about a 95% survival rate, but an older person will have a far lower survival rate, and worse quality of life if they survive too.</p>
<p>So you're basically comparing how many people have died vs the efficiency of the vaccine against COVID once you get it. That means that, if you get the vaccine, you're only 5% likely to simply GET symptoms of COVID, and if you get COVID, then you apply whatever the survival rate is for you.</p>
<p>So, getting the vaccine means that you'll only have a 5% chance to get infected, and then you'll have a higher chance to get a milder version of COVID IF you get infected too.</p>
<p>The COVID vaccine has conclusively proven to give a better, more long-lasting protection against COVID than natural immunity too.</p>

        <p>Where did I say that? I said that it became a priority, so, instead of waiting their turn, studies skipped the wait and went directly to revision. There were no skipped steps.</p>
<p>Yes I've heard about that medication from the 50s that's not a vaccine that ended up promoting an overhaul of the whole way we test medicines, making sure they're far safer than they ever were.. Have you heard about literally any other vaccine and how they're so safe we literally give them to babies?</p>
<p>And another question, if this vaccine is so potentially dangerous, how come doctors are being the ones getting them first? Wouldn't them, as experts, be the first ones to skip the vaccine? Why is it that the overwhelming majority can't wait to get it first?</p>

        <p>and you'd be wrong at least in my case.  See I live in the real world.  Not the fairy tale one a lot of people want to live in. I'm 'essential' so I don't really have a choice.  Pay me 75% of what I make weekly and I'll cheerfully sit at home with my wife and dogs and do quite well. Oh wait. Nobody is going to do that unless I'm COVID positive.

        <p>No, not even in the UK or in Germany ‚essential workers‘ could stay home. They had to get to work everyday to sell you groceries or collect your trash. Police- and fireman also still had to show up. So what You’re saying is pure bs. But by your logic, all these essential workers should already be dead by now if COVID is so prevalent and deadly. They’re not? Maybe the problem are elderly care homes and hospitals? But what could politicians do about that? Nothing, am I right..</p>

        <p>Oh so I'm 'expendable'? Got it.  I can run the risk of catching this 'oh so deadly disease' literally THOUSANDS of times a day so you can buy your groceries.  Hey thanks.  Glad me 'risking my life' ensures you don't go hungry.  Like I said I've been on the front line of this bullshit pretty much every day since it started and, other than a bout of the flu which I got tested for just in case, the time I was near two coworkers who came down with it that I got tested for, and actually being in the same room unmasked with someone who tested positive the next day which I got tested for, I haven't contracted it.  I must be a medical fucking miracle.  We have 136 employees and to date only two of them have come down with it.  We don't wear masks in the break room nor do we wear them in the back room.  But it's 'oh so contagious'.  You people act like if someone isn't wearing a mask you're going to contract is if they're in your field of vision.  Here's two options.  If you see someone without a mask don't go near them.  Option B.  Stay home and order in.  I really do not see how that is all that difficult for you people to grasp.</p>

        <p>People will be discussing this and re figuring the numbers for years after this. We all know that dieing with covid and dieing from covid is not the same thing. We also know that most of the deaths are of people at or above their life expectancy, so if it wasn’t covid then they would have died of something else a couple months later. 
The main problem many of us have is that the remedy looks like it’s more harmful than the disease, but we can’t seem to have an honest discussion about the pros and cons without being “othered” and demonized.</p>

        <p>Death is the natural conclusion to life. Most anything has the potential of killing you. By this logic you take your life in your own hands every time you start your car or cross the street. Every aspect of life has risk. The rub in this situation is that we are loosing the autonomy to make those risk assessments for ourselves. My safety guy at work drives a motorcycle, smokes, and also yells at anyone who lets their noses show while wearing a mask. The hypocrisy is maddening.</p>

        <p>Risk assessment no longer applies when that risk impacts another life. Sure, great, you’ve decided to flout the rules because your autonomy allows that, but because people refuse to isolate when they know they’re contagious, they are putting the lives of others who cannot avoid all contact at greater risk.</p>
<p>Your Liberty stops where mine begins, and that includes the right to life. You can’t just assume you will not be infringing because a person looks healthy to you, so the moral decision is to avoid potential infringement at all</p>

        <p>The point is, as a worker in a nearly identical situation as the one above, I would have no idea there was even a new virus if it wasn't for word-of-mouth. As someone who comes into contact nearly every day with people not wearing masks, not social distancing (I work in a tiny store where it's just impossible), and handling cash frequently, nothing has ever come of it. Even my elderly coworkers are coming in every day without trouble.</p>
<p>I know this is just anecdotal and for the first few months of it all I didn't want to let my own experience negate what I heard about on the news. But as the months have gone on and on, things supposedly get worse and worse, still nothing about my life indicates any of it is true. How long am I supposed to go on mindlessly absorbing the news my tellybox feeds me before I start to question why I haven't seen any indication of it all in real life?</p>
<p>I'm not saying the virus is a hoax or that it doesn't kill people. But for a virus to be so bad it justifies what we've done for the last year, I think it would have to be much more of a danger than it seems to be.</p>

        <p>Not seeing something for yourself should not be justification to dismiss the evidence of those who have interacted with it. As you say all you have are anecdotes, but on my side of it I had a co-worker nearly die if it hadn’t been for a ventilator keeping her going. As our anecdotes are wildly different, clearly the best course of action is to rely on the empirical evidence, for which the data is the same regardless of which of us access it.</p>

        <p>While I appreciate that you are skim reading my comments in order to make “gottem” remarks, but you will notice that I did say she isn’t dead, and of course to give you personal details of a living colleague of mine would be wildly inappropriate when, and I really wish you would pay attention this time, the anecdote has as much weight as of the person I was commenting against. I do notice you haven’t pestered him for evidence, would that have something to do with the fact that you aren’t requesting evidence in good faith, but rather simply to attack someone who you believe is against you?</p>

        <p>Again I’m confused what your argument is? You want a lockdown so strict that people are unable to even obtain food, and as such would eventually starve? Because I don’t know what that has to do with taking strict measures that involve avoiding any non-essential journeys?</p>

        <p>I want no lockdown at all, but I do want to see how well people survive with no one to wait on them. I said "customer service", which means no tech support or anything of that nature either. Absolutely none. Of course, it wouldn't change any minds.</p>
<p>And lockdown has already contributed to people starving and going further into poverty.</p>
<p>As for my "argument", well, you asked if we should "let people die". We're already doing that. Just choosing which people die. Essential workers are one group.</p>

        <p>Again you’re acting as if I’m agreeing that we should let those workers die. I’m specifically saying that the best move to limit deaths is to restrict workers to ACTUAL essential roles like ensuring people can buy basic supplies. Your “total lockdown” idea seems just like vindictive hyperbole to go “well look, this is what happens when we lockdown completely, so everything must be judged against that” which is such a ridiculous argument to make, because it is not grounded in realistic proposals.</p>
<p>The republican government blocking monetary aid whilst simultaneously is what has caused starvation and homelessness. Maybe if people hadn’t kept voting for a party that clearl exists to further benefit the wealthy, people would have been receiving the aid they need. That’s why other countries haven’t had such a damaging economic outlook from the pandemic, they helped</p>

        <p>Yes, making people <em>more</em> dependent on the government can't possibly go wrong. /s</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I know from experience once someone relies on aid for their survival, they'll continue to do so for the rest of their life.</p>

<p>That's because the point is "do it yourself". The absolute helplessness that would result from lack of customer service wouldn't change any minds, but it would be amazingly hilarious to see.</p>
<p>&rt;I’m specifically saying that the best move to limit deaths is to restrict workers to ACTUAL essential roles like ensuring people can buy basic supplies.</p>
<p>Or everybody can just use self-checkout so the workers don't have to work, but people consider bagging their own food to be "working", so fat chance.</p>

        <p>Most of these just show how they can reduce the spread at first, once you reopen, even if at 0 cases, things go back up. The only solution would be to either do perpetual lockdowns for ages or to just not lock down.</p>
<p>Oh and that article about sweden is literally from a chinese propaganda source so anything it says is basically discredited immediately. But that's irrelevant since it would be discredited anyway as sweden's total deaths in 2020 followed previous trends despite having no lockdown. It doesn't matter how many opinion articles people throw at me about how sweden "failed" the data is the data.</p>

        <p>Well yeah.. that’s how infectious diseases work. Unless you lock down long enough the bring the cases down to 0 they’re going to start climbing again as soon as you open back up. </p>
<p>Bringing cases down to 0 is not realistic for the US, you can do periodic lockdowns if hospitals become overwhelmed but COVID is not going to go away until people get vaccines which won’t happen because Americans are anti-vaxx.</p>

        <p>Have you actually read your links?</p>
<p>Your first one uses cell-phone data to estimate virus spread using "modeling". Modeling, as we have seen, is just hocus-pocus. Cell phone movement has nothing to do with viral spread. <em>Unless you make it seem like it does</em>. Modeling doesn't <em>prove</em> anything. Or .. more specifically, it can prove <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>Your second one seems to hang on the fact that lockdowns reduce new cases, but seems to adamantly refuse to examine if deaths are reduced at all.</p>
<p>Your third about Sweden isn't really a study, but it made me check out Sweden's current situation now. It's funny .. it seems like a big noise being made recently about <em>laws</em> being changed so now the government <em>could</em> tighten protocols, *but nothing has actually practically changed .. and cases are currently receding.</p>
<p>And the last one is more of a "report" than a study, explaining how Ontario arrived at its policies.</p>

        <p>Modeling sounds like hocus pocus if you don’t understand stats. The purpose of the cell phone data was to see how much people moved around in the first vs the second lockdown. The more people everyone comes in contact with, the more people COVID spreads to.</p>

        <p>Those are graphs without context. There isn't enough here to draw a full conclusion.</p>
<p>Here's an article from the cdc if you'd like to take a look.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html</p>
<p>Fair warning, it's dreadfully boring as science can be. Here's the conclusion: </p>
<p>"Experimental and epidemiological data support community masking to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The prevention benefit of masking is derived from the combination of source control and personal protection for the mask wearer. The relationship between source control and personal protection is likely complementary and possibly synergistic, so that individual benefit increases with increasing community mask use. Further research is needed to expand the evidence base for the protective effect of cloth masks and in particular to identify the combinations of materials that maximize both their blocking and filtering effectiveness, as well as fit, comfort, durability, and consumer appeal. Adopting universal masking policies can help avert future lockdowns, especially if combined with other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, hand hygiene, and adequate ventilation."</p>
<p>Masks alone aren't going to save the world, but their data suggests that they help slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <p>Neat.  Here’s another article, also from the CDC, that was done pre-covid:</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>&rt;    Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</p>
<p>Basically: in theory masks can limit transmission, but in practice, they don’t actually do so.   And that makes sense- people aren’t disposing masks like they’re supposed to. They constantly fiddle with them and touch their face.  The moisture builds up and incubates shit. Etc.  </p>
<p>So, sorry - not going to drink the mask kool-aid.</p>

        <p>Mask kool-aid sounds gross. I wouldn't drink that either.</p>
<p>For me, wearing a mask is like deciding to not litter. There's still garbage on the ground, but I don't have to contribute to it. I can only control my own actions and try to nudge things in the right direction.</p>
<p>For what its worth, I'm not trying to lecture you. Just giving my perspective.</p>

        <p>Lmao did you even look at your own graphs? It shows a decline after mask mandates are implemented. </p>
<p>The Danish study was inconclusive, 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). Among participants, 46% wore the mask as recommended and 47% wore it "predominantly as recommended”.</p>

        <p>Explain the logic to me. From a common sense perspective, if everyone stays home more and reduces the amount of people they come in contact with, COVID will be spread to fewer people. Can you explain why that wouldn’t work?</p>

        <p>I'm not using it as justification, but as explanation. The lockdowns didn't work, as evidenced by the media moaning and screeching about muh cases. You said it was because of non-compliance, and it may very well be, I don't know or care. But the fact that they didn't work holds. Non-compliance is a valid and sufficient reason to dismiss lockdowns as ineffective. If a 100% compliance rate is required for them to work, then they will NEVER work.</p>

        <p>Again, this is not justification, but explanation of why it doesn't work. My justification to not comply is something else. Namely, I just don't care. I was living my life, and one day they told me I couldn't come out of my house. Then they told me I had to wear some weird surgeon thing when I come out of my house. And suddenly everyone around me is a hypochondriac. So of course I resisted against all of those things, how wouldn't I?</p>

        <p>That's bullshit. Let's say you have a sister and I kidnap her. I send you a video of me torturing her every day. I tell you that if you watch them for 2 weeks, you can have your sister back. So you do.</p>
<p>Two weeks pass and you demand that I release your sister. I tell you that instead of 2 weeks it will be 2 months. 2 months pass and I tell you that actually, it will be a year. At some point you'll stop watching. And then everyone blames you for not complying with my demands.</p>
<p>Now here's my question. Who's at fault here? You, for stopping to watch the videos once it's clear I have no intention to let her go? Or me, for kidnapping your goddamn sister in the first place?</p>
<p>If it wasn't clear, "you" in the analogy is me, and "me" in the analogy is the government.</p>

        <p>1) Ok, so reality is simpler that the analogy, I don't see how that changes anything.</p>
<p>2) I wasn't taking any action. I was simply living like it was 2019. I didn't make it a point to 'go against the lockdowns' or anything, I just didn't care. But that's the definition of inaction. Conversely, it was the government that took action by locking down, and you blackmailing us with "if you don't comply it will last longer" sounds more like taking action than our "just leave us alone pls".</p>

<p>2) don’t treat it like taking or not taking an action, but a multiple choice menu in an RPG. Each choice has a consequence, and you ( and many others) chose the choice that results in an extended lockdown, just like the action to do nothing can kill the princess in an RPG.</p>

<p>2) You missed the point of the analogy. The kidnapper doesn't break the rule "just because".

        <p>So my solution doesn't work. Fine. You're right, I'm not any closer to ending this circus than I was in March 2020. </p>
<p>However your solution doesn't work either. I don't know what the compliance rate is, but it's pretty high. And still, the media keeps saying however-many new cases every day, and the government keeps coming up with new ways of making our lives worse.</p>
<p>So complying with lockdowns doesn't work, and resisting the lockdowns doesn't work. We're fucked either way. However the non-compliance route doesn't make me want to die (most of the time anyway), and in fact makes the situation kinda tolerable, so I'm gonna go with that.</p>

        <p>Your mixing up absolute cases and transmission rate. Cases can still remain high even if the growth rate is declining. For example if the Reproduction rate is 2, every person with COVID infects approximately 2 other people. A lockdown will reduce your daily contacts so it might fall to 1. That means that every person who has COVID infects around 1 other person. Case numbers are still growing but at a slower rate.</p>

        <p>How do you think COVID spreads? Aerosols right? The virus attaches to droplets from spit and mucus. Masks prevent some droplets from spraying into the air. Cloth masks are minimally effective, three-layer masks or medical masks are best.</p>

        <p>"some droplets"</p>
<p>Not enough of them to make a significant difference.</p>
<p>Plus, any droplets that are large enough to enmesh in the cloth matrix of the mask will either evaporate into smaller droplets over time or get displaced by the next exhalation.</p>
<p>This is actually really basic stuff that is well understood.  It's been known for decades.  That's why Fauci and all the other "experts" said that masks were useless in the beginning of the scam-demic.  They were merely citing the pre-COVID (re: non-political) scientific "consensus" based on decades of experimentation and observation.</p>

        <p>You don’t seem to understand how liquids behave. Water evaporating is better than being sprayed outwards. Droplets don’t hit other droplets with enough force to spray it outwards, if anything they’d bond together. Talking, coughing, yelling can spread spit surprisingly far. https://youtu.be/gElHX1AIIOY</p>

        <p>I don’t like wearing masks or lockdowns either but I’m not disingenuous enough to pretend they don’t work to slow transmission. The biggest issue I see with the US is that they don drawn out half assed lockdowns. If hospitals are reaching capacity, do a shorter, strict lockdown. Studies show mask mandates slow transmission so I’m fine with them until vaccines are widely available.</p>

<p>These are the deaths-per-capita by state. Look up and down and find a correlation between lockdown strictness and deaths-per-capita. Some states at the top locked down hard; some locked down gently; some didn't lock down at all. </p>
<p>The biggest problem in the US is that the governors of the strict lockdown states can't backtrack now, no matter how damaging their crap policies were. You clearly are disingenuous enough to pretend that the lockdowns worked so that you don't have to come to terms with the fact that you supported a policy that sacrificed the youth of this country for no real gain.</p>

        <p>It’s extremely difficult to compare states to states. They’re very different in terms of population density and climate. If you really want to see if lockdowns work, look at the case growth before and after lockdowns. The main issue is that US lockdowns are very messy, they’re not strict and they’re so drawn out.</p>

        <p>&rt; It’s extremely difficult to compare states to states. They’re very different in terms of population density and climate</p>
<p>That's a fair point, and I don't necessarily disagree. However, if you accept that, then I don't want to hear a single word about New Zealand, Taiwan, or any other Pacific island nation with insanely low populations.</p>
<p>&rt;  If you really want to see if lockdowns work, look at the case growth before and after lockdowns.</p>
<p>How is that a fair comp? Now you're looking at totally different seasons (US strictest lockdown was during Spring/Summer, when respiratory viruses are at their least deadly) and totally different situations within those seasons. In the Summer, southern states like Florida, California, Texas, and Arizona spiked, not because of lockdowns, but because the heat there keeps people indoors in the Summer.</p>
<p>&rt; The main issue is that US lockdowns are very messy, they’re not strict and they’re so drawn out.</p>
<p>In other words, the main issue in the US is that some politicians and police officers will not lock the entire population in their homes for months or years? That is one of the best things I could imagine saying about the US, and I'm someone who is often critical of US policy</p>

        <p>Sure seasons play a factor but if you look at COVID transmission rates before and after, you see a decline after 10-15 days so I doubt it’s always the season. I think half ass drawn out lockdowns are far worse than short, strict lockdowns</p>

        <p>I will say, I feel for you. I've tried to post in more mainstream subs, in the most harmless language I could muster, but I've been downvoted in much the same way for expressing even a hint of contrarian views. I've had to wait a half hour just to make a single reply, getting dozens of comments all the while. It pretty much makes discussion impossible. Maybe some people want things to unfold this way, but me personally, I don't. Not even if I disagree with you, not even if you're the asshole, not even at all. Sorry bro</p>

        <p>My stepbrother is extreme far Left and frequents the Leftist subreddits.  The majority of his posts are anti-Trump, anti-police so he's generally well liked on Reddit. </p>
<p>He made one post mentioning that his buddy took the COVID vaccine and still got COVID afterwards... and they tore him to shreds... called him an anti-vaxer, a Trump supporter.  He didn't even speak badly of the vaccine, he just reiterated the story.  They can't even handle percent dissent.</p>

        <p>maybe. I probably haven't seen that movie since I was a teenager, or, like, whenever my family would've rented it at a damn Blockbuster Video. I'm pretty sure I remember exactly what you're talking about though, where one of the two characters recites a poem or something. But I sure didn't do it on purpose!</p>

        <p>yep, that's the one. I remember having the sense that this movie was pretty cheesy, but I also remember liking it when I saw it. Side note though, I really thought Alex Mack was the love interest in this movie. I remember Julia Stiles being her older sister I believe, but somehow I got the main characters mixed up totally</p>

        <p>I mean, according to excess deaths calculations, most of the excess deaths were last year on march-april, right now we are at basically normal number, if only a little bit high, (and we are in a high death season) because apparently all other respiratory diseases disappeared.</p>

        <p>Hi Roosty,  Thanks for asking.  My younger sister had her heart stop in the ER 9 years ago.  She now has a pacemaker.  She was born with a heart defect.  I have visited both of my parents in the cardiac ICU  after mild heart attacks along with my sister before she was 40.  Both of my parents are still alive.  I know all about heart disease Reddit stranger.<br>
Maybe ask yourself,  wHy can’t you care about both people who get covid and people with heart disease?  Why is it such an either or for you?</p>
<p>I’d love to reply to everyone else but I’m only allowed to say anything every 10 minutes.  Yay freedom of speech!</p>

        <p>&rt; From 1980 to 2019, between eight and nine people per 1,000 have died each year in the United States. In 2019, the most recent year with official death estimates, 2,854,838 Americans died, and 3,747,540 were born. That means that 8.7 people died per 1,000 that year — up from a low of 7.9 deaths per 1,000 people in 2009...</p>
<p>&rt;...According to preliminary weekly data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (as of January 6, 2021), 3,187,086 people died from all causes between January 1 and December 26, 2020. While this data is preliminary and is incomplete for at least the last eight weeks of reported data, it provides for useful context.</p>
<p>&rt; According to the same estimates, 2,852,609 people died in 2019, meaning at least 334,000 more people have died so far in 2020 than 2019, despite missing or incomplete data for October through December. Using the recent estimate of the 2020 population from the Census Bureau, the death rate so far in 2020 would be 9.7 deaths per 1,000, the highest death rate since 1949. However, the recent population estimate does not incorporate the results of the 2020 Census, which should improve the accuracy of the estimate.</p>
<p>https://usafacts.org/articles/preliminary-us-death-statistics-more-deaths-in-2020-than-2019-coronavirus-age-flu/</p>
<p>So a ~10% increase in deaths with the incomplete data in the year over year count.</p>

        <p>Compare apples to apples.  Respiratory related deaths in 2019 to respiratory related deaths in 2020.  If you say that the majority of deaths attributed to Covid were people that just up and died and were going to die anyways you absolutely are a covid denier.  If you are all about “with covid” not “of covid” you are a Covid denier.  Even if every single influenza death since this virus came out was attributed to Covid, there are not normally this many respiratory related deaths per year.  I “argued” this same logic here on this sub when it was 200,000 US death and still people are saying the same shit at 400,000 deaths.  At what point do any of those deaths actually matter? </p>
<p>What exactly is a deadly overreaction to 400,000 deaths?  Face masks?  No in person dining?  No gyms?  Having to line up outside stores?  In creased Suicides from mental health challenges?  Families without food on their tables?  People beating their spouses from increased stress?</p>
<p>You know, you are allowed to care about both sides without denying the other side...</p>

        <p>Well there's the case of respitory virus deaths, but it goes far beyond this.</p>
<p>First of all, due to the way they count covid deaths (death within 28 days of a positive test), people who are dying of heart attacks who had heart problems are being listed as covid, saying it's the primary cause. So comparing to deaths of leading causes, and to some extent of old age too, could be significant.</p>
<p>There are also the added deaths to certain causes because of lockdown. I know this a far less direct comparison, but lockdowns have added to suicide deaths for example, which without them there would have been considerably less of this year.</p>
<p>It's not really meant as a counter to your point, it just crossed my mind while reading your comment. I think in time we'll be able to make better comparisons as all of the statistics become less muddy (and in some cases censored), and the effects of lockdowns reveal themselves more as years pass.</p>

Combine that with states the stored covid patients in nursing homes (new secretary of health pulled her mom out of a nursing home and then ordered covid positive patients be put in nursing homes) and you can see how this death total is far higher than it ever should have been. Add on the incentives hospitals have had in the past to report a death as covid and you get an inflated number of deaths. </p>
<p>Not claiming that covid is a hoax, but that the measures we are going to don't seem to align with the mortality rate.</p>

        <p>what they are doing is moving the goal posts to support the preposterous claim</p>
<p>&rt;  If you are all about “with covid” not “of covid” you are a Covid denier</p>
<p>This is akin to saying BBQ sauce is to blame for heart attacks because people that eat BBQ sauce have it on their shirts when they have a heart attack</p>
<p>What they are conveniently ignoring is the excess deaths that are attributed to suicide, drug overdose, lack of preventative medical care, domestic violence, malnutrition, freezing to death on a porta potty because the homeless shelter kicked you out because of covid......</p>
<p>The issue with the commenters argument is primarily that it is 1 dimensional and fails to account for 2nd and 3rd order effects.  <br>
They'd rather 500,000 people die of other causes just so fewer people can die of covid</p>
<p>It's not a rational or informed position to hold, but their ego won't let them see that</p>

        <p>Shipping covid+ elderly people to nursing homes against the CDC's directives leading to nursing home cases to skyrocket, blasting people's lungs out by placing them on ventilators too early, heart-attacks/strokes from being too afraid of or being told avoid hospitals, undiagnosed cancers getting diagnosed too late, missed cancer treatments leading to death, suicides, drug overdoses, alcoholism and deaths of despair from depression, dementia patients dying from loneliness and isolation. What you stand behind is killing people too. There is no solution that does not involve a trade-off of deaths. Stop being so myopic and dense. It's getting really tiresome.</p>

        <p>is the implication I'm not admitting I was wrong?</p>
<p>I've done that about this pandemic.   <br>
In the beginning, around december 2019 I was beginning to get full doomer prepped in anticipation of supply chain breakdown due to massive death rates and mandatory regional isolation.   <br>
Then, as more information came in I was able to reassess and see that my earlier predictions were wrong and any conclusions I had were wrong (around march/april 2020).   <br>
From that point forward I started planning for the economic issues that were sure to ensue from a needlessly panicked public.   <br>
As more time progressed I could see even that was wrong and all I really needed to do was keep on keeping on.</p>
<p>I was wrong in my assessment at the start, gathered new data, looked at the science and reassessed iteratively as new data came in.  <br>
Today I'm back to worrying about the massive asteroid that is on a collision course with our planet - the only unknown factor is <em>when</em></p>

        <p>The CDC explains that the data is not finalized until two years after a year ends, and that reporting is typically a couple months behind.  CDC statisticians have reportedly estimated based on current data and how reporting occurred in past years that the excess deaths will be between 316,000 to 431,000.  Excess deaths are being seen at various levels in countries all over the world. Through November, there were 85,000 more deaths than expected in the UK, comparable to WWII.  Are there statisticians who are looking at all of the current data and reaching different conclusions?</p>

        <p>Oh sorry, I thought you were smart enough to get the info yourself.  In google, just type total deaths US 2016 (or whatever year your looking for)  if you’re saying provisional means the data can change, then why are you freaking out now with all of the current data? Shouldn’t you wait 3 years?  Or can those number only go up, not down?</p>

        <p>What does the CDC know anyways.  So weird they reported almost 300K excessive deaths in America by October 2020. </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm</p>
<p>It most definitely didn’t get worse since then right?</p>
<p>I would have respect for you guys if you actually owned your shit.  Just say “It’s only killing old people we can’t let that screw up our entire economy”.  That at least would be honest and that is a valid way to feel. </p>
<p>It’s not valid to say that nobody extra is dying.  That is straight up bullshit. </p>
<p>No surprise though.  It was the exact same conversation here 3 months ago.  And in 3 months it will still be the same here.</p>

        <p>No one here has provided a sound argument enumerating the flaws in counting COVID deaths. Rather than  capture and explain how the differences across states, physician vs medical examiner determinations, and factors like counting probable vs confirmed cases all are conspiring to over inflate the count, the arguments so far rely on a simplistic understanding of how primary cause of death is attributed to COVID.  for example, statements go around in this thread like “if they had a positive Covid test within 28 days” the cause of death is attributed to Covid.   This is simply and probably not true.  This IS how a case is generally determined as confirmed Vs just probable.  But attributing cause of death to Covid still requires a physician, medical examiner or sometime to determine that it is likely that Covid was the primary cause of death.   Of course they are not always right, but that is not evidence of some vast over counting.  It’s just the reality that people are doing the best they can to reasonably give their best insight as to the actual cause of death without spending additional, often unavailable resources, to be definitive.  </p>
<p>A terminally ill cancer patient who gets killed due to a car crash didn’t die due to their cancer even if they were terminally ill. It was still the car crash the caused the death, even if the person likely would have died due to the cancer at some point in the near future. Now, are you certain it was actually the car crash and not the cancer?  Probably not 100% certain.  </p>

<p>So the 28 day thing is happening in the UK</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm</p>
<p>This chart shows that the deaths "involving" covid is in the 300,000s. That word involving is already telling that not all of those people were killed BY covid but died WITH covid and the 500,000 number that's being thrown around is all deaths INVOLVING pneumonia, influenza, OR covid.</p>

        <p>So now you are all clinging to excessive deaths and nobody cares that normally less than 40K  die each year of respiratory infections of all types. </p>
<p>So you are saying either </p>
<p>A) 400,000 normally die of the flu each year</p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>B) There is a global conspiracy to report all deaths as covid.  No more people died in 2020 than died in 2019.  </p>
<p>Nobody here actually cares about facts like historical flu deaths. Nobody cared 3 months ago when I posted a link to the CDC statistics showing that and nobody cares now. </p>
<p>But heck.  I don’t belong here anyways right?</p>

        <p>What I’m saying is, many of the people who died from COVID would have either passed from one of their chronic health conditions, or were weak enough to where a common cold or flu would take them out. Look at the distribution of ages of death. It isn’t the young and healthy.</p>

        <p>No, many of them are iatrogenic deaths, deaths caused by acute social isolation, and deaths caused by acute stress.  They're being classified as "COVID deaths" because, well, what else are they going to do?  Admit that the very policies designed to "saves lives" actually caused hundreds of thousands of people to die prematurely?  What I find so amazing about you people is your total lack of skepticism about all this.  You simply accept everything at face value without even the slightest hesitation.  You don't question any of it, despite the glaring conflicts of interest and the myriad perverse incentives.  You're like an army of robots mindlessly spewing forth programmed responses.</p>

<p>Almost like mindless robots.  🤔. Pretty darn predictable really. </p>
<p>If I check back in another 3 months I will get the same insults hurled at me and will be told the same reasons why 600,000 people didn’t die of covid and why there isn’t a pandemic.</p>

        <p>No.  You’re calling me a robot because I’m not agreeing with you.  I have my own life experience just like you.  I have family just like you.  And I know nothing about you just like you know nothing about me.  </p>
<p>Yet you are declaring that all the people here form their own thoughts and feelings and I do not.  </p>
<p>It would be awfully convenient if everyone that disagrees with your views had been brainwashed by some authority figure.  Sorry, that’s not how the world works. You can’t paint everyone whose opinions you dislike with the same brush and declare them a robot. </p>
<p>The irony is I’m middle of the road in all this.  But the second I’m not all rah rah NNN this NNN that!!!  this exact thread can be replicated time and time again.</p>

        <p>Did you read that the WHO changed the way confirmed cases should be counted today? That means we need to go back through the data to remove extraneous cases</p>

        <p>Sadly not all teenagers. I frequently argue with a fellow PhD student who must get his info from these echo chambers (saying it’s like the flu...). It boggles my mind how stupid some smart people can still be.</p>

        <p>Right then, let's do the math even the CDC uses: The actual deaths directly due to covid is 2% of what the media claims, meaning that 400,000 is actually around 8,000 deaths.</p>
