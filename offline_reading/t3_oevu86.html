    <strong>Only a few people seem to be pissed off that we still have to wear masks on public transportation</strong>
    <p><p>I've been having to avoid using any kind of public transportation since the mandate. The only times I was subjected to mask tyranny was when I'd have to visit the dentist or hospital. </p>
<p>Yet I just want to travel and it's frustrating. I can't use the subway without being mandated to wear a mask. Can't use the train without being forced to wear a mask. Can't travel on the bus without one. Can't even use Uber, Lyft or a Taxi. </p>
<p>I AM EVEN VACCINATED </p>
<p>Like what was the whole fucking point? We were trained to think if we got the shot things would get back to normal. Well life is at least 90% normal, but can't travel without the fucking mask. Like doing get me wrong there's plenty I can do in my state, but shit man I'd love to go to other states that we you know haven't been able to travel to. We've been sheltered in our own state for the past couple of years now. Unless you actually went through the hell hole of dealing with Covid TSA Agents.</p>
<p>It's just so aggravating even for vaccinated or unvaccinated people who want to travel, but can't drive or don't want to drive for twice the amount of time it would take to get to your destination just to avoid the TSA tyranny. Like at this point with the Delta variant and unvaccinated people are still alive and fine just let everyone who wants to travel do it without being attacked for not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>That's the other thing that pisses me off. You see "unruly" passengers get into fights or verbal arguments, but isn't it handy that the video only shows the part where they are flipping out on the staff? I'm pretty sure these "unruly" passengers were disturbed when they were just minding their own business without a mask. Or would take their mask off their nose to allow themselves to fucking take a breathe of air in. </p>
<p>Really September 13th can't come soon enough. Though public transportation is what will scare me the most when it'll come to using Covid Passports. Thankfully we haven't had to use them to go shopping, into a park, etc. Well depending on where you live. Yet I can see "the people" getting so tired of masks they will actually think Vaccine Passports will be a good way to "get back to normal". Yet normal is being able to travel without fearing someone is carrying a nuclear virus around that'll infect and kill all the passengers on board or some stupid belief like that.</p>
<p>Of course it's only the "far right" people that the news likes to call those who have it out for the mask mandate on public transportation.</p></p>

        <p>It's bc people have normalised it, in Ireland at least, folks were already extremely passive &amp; accepted the restrictions without a whimper. For more than a year now they have willingly obeyed &amp; if this were to continue indefinitely, most would have no problem with it. The point of masks was to completely isolate an already dehumanised &amp; submissive people.</p>

        <p>I’m sure plenty of people are pissed about masks on public transportation. They just don’t complain about it because they realize there’s nothing they can do about it.</p>
<p>It’s expected that the public transportation mask rules will be extended past September 13.</p>
