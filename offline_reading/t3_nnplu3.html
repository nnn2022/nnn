    <strong>Cancer Deaths up because we shut down medical care over a virus with a 99.97% survival rate.</strong>
    <p><p>"I can’t stop thinking about all those videos of dancing nurses and doctors that went viral last year. To me, if a pandemic were reaching plague levels, medical professionals wouldn’t have time to choreograph dance routines and record themselves for clickbait. To me, the leading causes of death shouldn’t be ignored so our medical “experts” can panic over a virus that has proven to be a little more than a bad flu."</p>

        <p>According to this mentality about the nurses, those videos of soldiers in the Vietnam war having fun at base camp must mean that the vietnam war wasn’t that serious and that people weren’t really dying all the time, because if they were, they wouldn’t be playing sports and wrestling back at base camp</p>

        <p>That is an idiotic comparison. People died because they shut down regular medical care because all the hospitals were allegedly "FULL!" Spending time choreographing and recording TikTok videos shows the hospitals were not full and that these clowns had plenty of downtime. </p>
<p>The entire country of Vietnam was not a warzone but we were told, repeatedly that people were dying in hallways because the entire hospital was full of dying Covid patients. This was bullshit and people died of other, treatable ailments because they were enjoying the panic porn.</p>

        <p>Not 100% of hospitals were overflowing, not 100% of hospitals made videos, not every hospital in every city across the entire country was having the same patient intake. Some states have had worse waves than others at different times. It has ebbed and flowed. Just as the entire country of Vietnam wasn’t a war zone, not every single hospital in the entire country was inundated with patients. Does that mean no hospitals were inundated and overflowing? So because some hospitals maybe weren’t bad, no hospitals could be bad, is that what you’re saying?</p>

        <p>So it’s the choreography that’s getting you? I mean we do realize that although they are doctors and nurses, they did have days off right? And on the days they worked, they get multiple breaks and lunches. Or is the fact that they got to go home and had breaks to eat also further proof that this isn’t serious? My point isn’t that the pandemic is serious or not serious, real or not real, my point is that logic is flawed to say that because nurses and doctors made a video of them dancing, this pandemic can’t be real. Of all the reasons why this pandemic isn’t a big deal, that’s one of the more flawed explanations</p>

        <p>I mean when you have the responsibility of peoples lives that are dying at a so called pandemic state, there should be no time to.</p>
<p>Basically you need spare time to get a group of nurses to dance like that.</p>
<p>There shouldn't be spare time in a pandemic situation with hospitals at full capacity.</p>
<p>Go to dance school on free time.</p>
<p>If my boss sees me dancing instead of working im fired, and thats only money on the line, not lives...</p>

        <p>So you’re saying people shouldn’t get breaks while on the clock while working at a hospital? And that on people’s days off, on their own times at home, they shouldn’t be allowed to learn a dance move, not on the clock, on their own time. And then during a 10 minute break they are legally allowed to have, they shouldn’t be able to choose what to do with it, I.e do the dance. So because you wouldn’t do it, are you the bar that most people should love their lives by?</p>

        <p>When you go into a hospital and see a bunch of people sitting and talking behind the counter, do you also tell those doctors and nurses to stop talking and start helping patients? When you’re in the hospital, do you normally have a doctor and nurse standing in your room, waiting for you to need help? Or do doctors and nurse keep everyone stabilized and help people throughout the day, realizing that 100% of your patients do not require 100% of your a physical presence ever day?</p>

        <p>Sometimes emergency rooms are full because patients are in the rooms. Just because they’re in the rooms doesn’t mean they need someone in there taking care of them 100% of the time, the patient may need to wait a couple hours for test results, sleep something off, or just wait until they feel better. That room is still occupied even though no one is in the room giving them care. Just because emergency rooms are fully occupied and overflowing doesn’t mean that there aren’t lulls in the overall busyness because sometimes patients need time between nurse/doctor interactions to see how they’re progressing</p>
