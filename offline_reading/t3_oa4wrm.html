    <strong>Straight from the horse's mouth.</strong>
    <p><p>TASS article from April 2020 by Mikhail Khanov, managing director of Algo Capital</p>
<p>"Pandemic masks cyclic crisis of world economy"</p>
<p>"It would seem surprising how powerful a blow to the global economy can be delivered by a disease whose death rate is lower than that of the well-known flu. But we would not be fooled into thinking that all the current problems are caused purely by the spread of COVID-19. We would venture to guess that we are witnessing the beginning of a legitimate cyclical crisis which has been 'disguised' as a pandemic.</p>
<p>By analogy with the previously unknown coronavirus, we are witnessing a "seasonal disease" of the economy, which occurs in an unusual form. But this does not invalidate for it the need for temporary "bed rest" and the use of previously known standard "medicines".</p>
<p>Let us not forget that even before the coronavirus infection emerged, key stock markets and more broadly the entire global economy were already on the verge of a decade-long cyclical downturn. It was to be on a par with the global financial crisis of 2008 and the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, which went far beyond its region. Incidentally, the 1998 default in Russia was one of its echoes."</p>
<p>"The classic economic crisis in a capitalist economy occurs when the overproduction of goods and services encounters the impossibility of selling them due to a lack of demand from an already indebted consumer. In today's globalised economy, however, with its international division of labour, the story is not played out within individual states, but on a global scale. The difference is that different states take on the roles of individual actors. However, everyone suffers as a result. Let us remember that the global financial crisis of 2008 began with the mortgage crisis in the US, which was initially perceived as a local problem.</p>
<p>"The classic way out of such a situation for an isolated state would be to prepare for a major war. However, in the global economy, a major war becomes a suicidal process for many countries. Therefore, the role of war has been taken over by a coronavirus infection which was very quickly given pandemic status."</p>

        <p>Thanks for the translation.  Very astute assessment, especially so early on in the pandemic.</p>

        <p>Been saying this forever.  This is a play by the elites to consolidate power and keep the cattle in the pen, but the gate is unlocked.</p>
