    <strong>I want to write an article for my journalism class about how maybe lockdown isn't the answer</strong>
    <p><p>What's the best way to go about this without getting in trouble, and getting a good grade? I also have to be kinda choosy with my interviews because a lot of kids in my school are pro lockdown (lame)</p></p>

        <p>Not sure about the exact marking scheme you have, but I really don't think you'll get in trouble as long as you back up your argument as well as possible, and avoid making assertions based on the experience of a few people. Try to argue against yourself and make sure your points hold up.</p>
<p>For example, "lockdowns are bad because I like my friends" is kind of a bad argument. But "lockdowns have negative effects on mental health because we're removed from friends, as shown by [cite proper study that looked at a large number of people]" is stronger (because society should change when it benefits people overall, not just the 3 people you interview)</p>
<p>Hell I think we should have locked down harder, but I'd be interested to see what you have to say as long as you present ideas logically etc</p>
<p>I guess it depends where in the world you are too, some places are more open to different ideas than others, but if you're in the US / UK / similar, you should be fine</p>

        <p>English Prof here: academic freedom should guarantee that your opinions are not graded poorly as long as they're backed up by evidence. There are plenty of studies posted in this sub that you could use as sources to criticize lockdowns. Lean hard on evidence when using controversial opinions. </p>
<p>However, many academics are terrible people, so your teacher/prof might still give you a lower grade. Although, it would be difficult to justify if your paper has a clear thesis and sufficient evidence. Good luck!</p>

<p>Professor, please. You and I both know that a professor doesn't have to defend the giving of a low grade, even when it is given unjustly. A student has little recourse, unless the professor was so foolish as to sexually harass the student, racially slur the student, or do something else that would be actionable.</p>

        <p>Makes me sad to say this, because I think that this would be a cool thing for you to do, but I think you'd do well to abandon this project. You're in a highly subjective field, and antagonizing your possibly highly liberal professor could get your life derailed.</p>
<p>Save the rebellion for after graduation. Don't worry about the historical moment you'll be missing. There will be plenty more of those, all too soon.</p>
