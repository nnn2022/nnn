    <strong>The Current Situation..</strong>
    <p><p><strong>So, let me get this straight:</strong> It seems very likely that "COVID-19" and the so called "vaccines" are not truly new (<a href="https://odysee.com/@FwapUK:1/A-manufactured-illusion.-Dr-David-Martin-with-Reiner-Fuellmich-9_7_21_-720p:5">https://odysee.com/@FwapUK:1/A-manufactured-illusion.-Dr-David-Martin-with-Reiner-Fuellmich-9_7_21_-720p:5</a>), we know that the "vaccines" are not nearly as safe as they say (<a href="https://undercurrents723949620.wordpress.com/2021/05/22/how-many-have-died-from-covid-vaccines/">https://undercurrents723949620.wordpress.com/2021/05/22/how-many-have-died-from-covid-vaccines/</a>), and we know that an ineffective vaccine can cause a virus to become more problematic (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002198#ack">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002198#ack</a>).</p>
<p>Yet we see a push for 100% vaccination, incessant fear mongering/propaganda , endless lockdowns, "COVID Passports", etc. </p>
<p>Many people we know and love have participated in this global experiment, no questions asked. I think we can agree that this is both deeply saddening and infuriating. I believe we should all express our point of view to those we know, but <strong>speak it from a loving place</strong>. Whether or not you are religious, think about how Jesus taught and lead in the bible. </p>
<p>It may seem clear to us that this is a hoax and a means of ushering in total control, but others genuinely think they are being good by following along. Cognitive dissonance is strong, and realizing what is happening will smash one's entire view of the world into pieces. The only way to help people realize that they are being lead by evil shepherds is to lead with love.</p>
<p>Please add any sources that you think would be helpful in educating ourselves and others.</p></p>

        <p>Human nature. Genocides are lead by evil men and carried out by normal people following orders for the greater good. Smart marketing/propaganda can make normal people feel great about doing something utterly depraved, stupid, or against their own interest/health.</p>
<p>Candidly, it’s by the grace of God I didn’t take it. When I saw them become immune from liability and one death in the family and one near-death, I knew this was another pack of lies.</p>

        <p>In the 1930's, there was the "Jewish problem". In 2021, there is is the "Unvaccinated problem". Neither was an actual problem, and both concepts were used to expand governmental control over the citizenry.</p>

        <p>Yes I agree, but I'd like to think that everyone I know is not suffering from psychopathy, but rather, being manipulated by psychopaths. Also, "turning the other cheek" is in reference to not retaliating against personal offenses (i.e. if someone slights your character, vengeance will lead you nowhere) . It is not to say we should be completely pacifist in the face of tyranny (excuse me if this is not the point you are arguing).</p>

        <p>I think  people are being turned into psychopaths by constant abuse. I don't know what the solution is- in my expereince neither the loving neither the confrontational approach works. Maybe love doesn't cure brainwashing either. My own mother refused to listen to both me and my sister and listened to the trash on TV instead and went and got double-vaxxed. She's been unwell ever since. </p>
<p>I am falling out with friends who I send links to and they reply with arrogant dismissals  (never actually looking at the info I sent them) implying that I am one of those "conspiracy crazies".  </p>
<p>The problem is that most people are too good natured to accept the idea that the doctors and pharmaceuticals they have trusted all their lives are criminal scumbags who lie and sell poisons to get rich ,  destroying people's health in the process.<br>
The evil is too great for their hearts and minds to take in and it can really lead to madness - so they are protecting themselves. </p>
<p>In my long experience with trying to get people to wake up: it generally doesn't work- they must wake up by themselves- all you can do is put out the the info and the inspiration as much as you can but don't engage in debate and arguments. Let them process it in their own time.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear about your mom.. Mine is sort of the same way, but she hasn't felt unwell thankfully. Any conversation that leads down that path can quickly end in her dismissing me and walking away in a fit.</p>
<p>It does seem like the social engineering/conditioning, if you will, has instilled some psychopathic characteristics in people. You and I very well may be dehumanized to the point of our own families disowning us... </p>
<p>That's a good point about accepting the evil in the world. I know my mom and sister get into this "evil overload" if I even suggest certain possibilities. Again, this is likely part of social conditioning of being fearful and needing "safety" <strong>at all costs</strong>.</p>
<p>I want to send some links to them, but it's definitely a tough bridge to cross. Perhaps the evil will unfold no matter what we do.. I'm not particularly religious, but The Book of Revelations sure makes it seem like Satan gets his way in this world.. Living isn't even on the table, the devote followers of Jesus just get an "easy" death to avoid the oncoming destruction.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess I'll see you in the gulags? 😅</p>

<p>For the low-down on The Book of Revelation ( it's a psy-op) I totally recommend DH Lawrence's Apocalypse. That's the guy who also wrote Lady Chatterley's Lover for which he is more famous.</p>
