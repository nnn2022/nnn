    <strong>“Stress And Dis-Ease” - How Chronic Fear, Panic and Hysteria Ravage Our Immune Systems And Make Us Ill. Top 20 Ways The Government Are Stressing Us Out Right Now (For A Friend)</strong>
    <p><p>“Mind over matter” is not simply a catchphrase. It is a truth based on what we know to be fact: that the brain, given the right set of directions, the right environment, and the proper stimuli, will always choose healing over disease.</p>
<p>The ability to fend off illness and disease depends on several factors, some of which are beyond our control, but <strong>the way we react to stress and the general health of our immune system are things we can influence. If we’re not able to change our response to stressors, we’ll find ourselves in a constant hormonal battle that will lead to serious health issues like hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. The brain and the immune system are in constant communication in this delicate balance that can be disrupted by any kind of physical or emotional stress.”</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-the-mind-heals-the-body/201411/how-stress-affects-the-immune-system">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-the-mind-heals-the-body/201411/how-stress-affects-the-immune-system</a></p>
<p>“In the early 1980s, psychologist Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, PhD, and immunologist Ronald Glaser, PhD, of the Ohio State University College of Medicine, were intrigued by animal studies that linked stress and infection. From 1982 through 1992, these pioneer researchers studied medical students. <strong>Among other things, they found that the students' immunity went down every year under the simple stress of the three-day exam period. Test takers had fewer natural killer cells, which fight tumors and viral infections. They almost stopped producing immunity-boosting gamma interferon and infection-fighting T-cells responded only weakly to test-tube stimulation.</strong></p>
<p>Those findings opened the floodgates of research. By 2004, Suzanne Segerstrom, PhD, of the University of Kentucky, and Gregory Miller, PhD, of the University of British Columbia, had nearly 300 studies on stress and health to review. Their meta-analysis discerned intriguing patterns. Lab studies that stressed people for a few minutes found a burst of one type of "first responder" activity mixed with other signs of weakening. <strong>For stress of any significant duration - from a few days to a few months or years, as happens in real life - all aspects of immunity went downhill. Thus long-term or chronic stress, through too much wear and tear, can ravage the immune system.”</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.apa.org/research/action/immune">https://www.apa.org/research/action/immune</a></p>
<p>While some have argued that short term stress can boost the immune system, few assert that chronic stress is helpful in any way. I believe our current predicament qualifies as “chronic”:</p>
<p>“We have proposed that short-term stress is one of the nature's fundamental but under-appreciated survival mechanisms that could be clinically harnessed to enhance immunoprotection. <strong>Short-term (i.e., lasting for minutes to hours) stress experienced during immune activation enhances innate/primary and adaptive/secondary immune responses. Mechanisms of immuno-enhancement include changes in dendritic cell, neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte trafficking, maturation, and function as well as local and systemic production of cytokines. In contrast, long-term stress suppresses or dysregulates innate and adaptive immune responses by altering the Type 1-Type 2 cytokine balance, inducing low-grade chronic inflammation, and suppressing numbers, trafficking, and function of immunoprotective cells. Chronic stress may also increase susceptibility to some types of cancer by suppressing Type 1 cytokines and protective T cells and increasing regulatory/suppressor T cell function</strong>. Here, we classify immune responses as being protective, pathological, or regulatory, and discuss "good" versus "bad" effects of stress on health. <strong>Thus, short-term stress can enhance the acquisition and/or expression of immunoprotective (wound healing, vaccination, anti-infectious agent, anti-tumor) or immuno-pathological (pro-inflammatory, autoimmune) responses. In contrast, chronic stress can suppress protective immune responses and/or exacerbate pathological immune responses.”</strong></p>

<p>Ignoring, for now, the adverse effects on our immune systems of digital oversanitisation, lack of sunlight and Vitamin D, let’s focus on mental and emotional distress and fear:</p>
<p>Top 20 Ways 2020 has increased our stress levels and consequently weakened our immune systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fear of the effects of the ‘virus’ itself and the exaggerated projections of its ‘devastation’</li>
<li>Fear of the oncoming measures to fight this ’virus’ and, once ended, the fear of their return (almost more effective on us than the normies, since we know where this is heading)</li>
<li>Lockdown/ social distancing, forcing the separations of (extended) families, lovers, friends and community support networks (especially fatal in the elderly). Cancellation of Easter, Thanksgiving and the threat of cancelling Christmas</li>
<li>Mandatory masks inhibit oxygen intake essential for health, stressing people out, making it harder to communicate and breathe in general</li>
<li>Generalised fear of and uncertainty in the future - normies and conspiracy analysts alike</li>
<li>Fear of each other, now we’ve all been reclassified as biohazardous germbags</li>
<li>Fear and stress about the economy, financial issues, unemployment, bankruptcy and homelessness</li>
<li>The (at least) 20% rise in mental illness and depression across every demographic since the lockdowns</li>
<li>Generalised accusations of racism and oppression against the majority of western citizens</li>
<li>Inability to express or exorcise the inevitable frustration through exercise, social media, protests etc. The media demonisation of those attempting to express these frustrations.</li>
<li>The apparent flip-flopping of governments and the 180 degree U-turns on matters of allegedly scientific developments</li>
<li>Being made to feel like selfish criminals for exercising our erstwhile basic human rights (plus fines, police violence and the threat of imprisonment)</li>
<li>The daily briefings and their ominous death numbers and the telegraphing of further totalitarianism to come</li>
<li>The removal or repression of essential activities, pleasure and joy from the lives of so many</li>
<li>Concern over our children, their education and the way they’re being controlled in the schools (when open)</li>
<li>Rise in child abuse (by adults) and adult abuse (by young people) within captive households (parents forcing their teenagers to stay inside)</li>
<li>The cessation of non-COVID appointments and treatments for the diagnosed and as-yet-undiagnosed sick</li>
<li>The placement of the sick into care/ nursing homes in March - now expected to repeat this winter</li>
<li>Fauci and Gates‘ dystopian pronouncements on what it will take to restore civilisation, and the twists and turns of the vaccine research and studies (perhaps 50% effective, dangers of trials revealed then covered up or concealed)</li>
<li>The MSM’s simply deceitful reporting on the dangers of COVID for children, pets and the otherwise healthy. Despite their eventual and inevitable retractions, the first cut is always the deepest and the horror stories remain in our minds and hearts, even when we actually see the retractions.</li>

<p>heh, i often agree with your posts as it were, i don't agree often with your 'premise' or dichotomies in some of your comments</p>
<p>too many 'non-referential' collective possessive pronouns</p>

        <p>Burdened by the unrelenting stress they are subjecting us too, our bodies, and minds are weakening, which is also resulting in our immune systems being virtually neutralized, thereby intensifying our vulnerability to viral infections among the conditions you mentioned.. This seems all to convenient as they appear to be preparing us for yet another strike.  This "stress test"  has all the earmarks of  a strategic and systematic  play by the TPTB. The severity of the role that stress is playing in our inability to fend off even the simplest of virus's is going unchecked and left hidden in the shadows. And also as you mentioned, couple this with lack of Vitamin D and adequate sunlight, and soon enough they won't need to invent a pandemic, nor develop a lethal virus,  the common cold will in fact become that killer germ with our bodies incapable of fighting it..</p>
<p>These could fall under the points you already made but Ill throw them in anyway.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The inner conflict and division between loved ones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ongoing new fears presented through bogus claims of COVID symptoms and side effects. COVID foot, COVID rash. The latest I've heard is a 28 yer old doctor dying of COVID complications, however she died of n unrelated brain bleed, but the inference is more than enough to make people think and worry. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unending cycle of lock down to freedom to lock down, ensuring that people cannot adjust or adapt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks, which also steal our identity / individuality, mentally breaking us down. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who are suffering from an ailment have become fearful of seeking medical assistance who now burden the additional stress of their current condition and the stress of potentially being afflicted or infected by COVID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rise in substance abuse as people fall into deeper depressions and try an counter the effects. They made sure that drugs are readily available on the streets and the the liquor stores are well stocked. This industry has not faltered in the least. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's  obvious, they don't need to kill us outright, they are killing us indirectly using stress as as the catalyst.  The collateral damage from COVID will last many years as disease and other conditions take a rapid upswing in the coming months and years.</p>

        <p>I’m sure everyone here has had firsthand experience with relentless stressors in our society, from the strains in our relationship, to our workaholic overcompensation for our gradually increasing cost of living, to the seemingly counterproductive and arbitrary legislations and fees we are constantly bombarded with here in America, and the list goes on... You need only pay attention to your personal life experience to fully absorb this fact.</p>
<p>Even if, we were to assume such a stressful cultural environment had been unintentionally created and fostered, or that the numerous stressors were necessary evils for some greater purpose... Look at how we differ from cultures in the Eastern hemisphere. </p>
<p>Where Eastern cultures encourage healthy lifestyle, we glorify the unhealthy ones. Eastern cultures are frequently inundated with herbal medicines and supplements, but we decry it as spiritual woo-woo, unless a particular corporation can benefit from it and sponsor scientific research into the herb (a recent and relevant example would be the popularization of turmeric for ‘general inflammation’ which is indeed helpful but they often tout it as the only solution for inflammation, and a necessary one at that). </p>
<p>Eastern cultures are rife with mindfulness philosophies, educating their public on stress management through meditation, exercise, breathing, etc. Such philosophies were initially dismissed by us Americans as unscientific, but later studies have showed the techniques to be highly effective, and now we are essentially plagiarizing it in therapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for instance, is basically mindfulness hiding behind a fancy medical term). Of course we do not credit the cultures or act particularly apologetic for our knee-jerk reactions to it. </p>
<p>Even if the government weren’t doing it on purpose, they have prevented us from learning stress management techniques, in addition to the many, many stressors they implement on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Edit: My first award that wasn’t a mask! Sweet, thanks!</p>
