    <strong>Czechia to reopen nightclubs next week, but no dancing allowed, only sitting with social distance, and you must wear a respirator</strong>
    <p><p>All the old people have had access to the vaccine and cases are way down in the country but the government is still restricting things.</p>
<p>https://www.idnes.cz/zpravy/domaci/adam-vojtech-ministerstvo-zdravotnictvi-otevreni-diskoteka-kluby-restaurace.A210528_095713_domaci_misl</p>
<p>translation</p>
<p>From Monday, music, game, dance and social clubs and discos, among others, will be able to open with regime measures. People will need to have antigen or PCR tests performed only by a healthcare professional to visit them.</p>
<p>Although discos may be opened and they may not be danced in, according to the measures, Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch announced at a press conference after Friday's extraordinary meeting of the government .</p>
<p>"Dance undoubtedly means much higher contact between people, shortness of breath, spread of the disease," the minister said. "I am convinced that people can come, sit down, have fun, consume, but dancing as an activity related to contact between people is not allowed at the moment," Vojtěch added.</p>
<p>In addition to tests, people will be able to prove themselves with a certificate of illness or vaccination against covid-19. They will have to wear respiratory protective equipment, keep spacing, only seats will be available.</p></p>

        <p>Czechia has completely lost the plot.  You need health paperwork to sit at a terrace, book a hotel or get a haircut. All employees in most companies and children in school are obligated to be tested repeatedly (used to be twice a week, now it is once a week I believe)</p>
<p>People are obligated to wear those FFP2 masks all over the place that really stick to your face and make you breath shallow. Get on the tram and everybody is diligenly obeying, nobody even pulls down the mask a little for a free breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Do what I do, take a train over to Poland, no border or covid check (maybe got a bit lucky), and the situation is much more chill here. You can go to a restaurant without feeling oppressed and people give very little fuck about masks at all.</p>

        <p>That's more or less my impression after a few days here. My Uber driver from the train station didn't have a mask, and that was the best welcome I could get.</p>

        <p>That bad, huh? Was that in Prague or somewhere else? You mentioned "tram", so I'm guessing Prague. </p>
<p>Sad seeing that happen since I was planning on moving there, but if it's like this, then I'm no so sure. </p>
<p>BTW, do you speak Polish? What prompted you, besides Czech's strict COVID regulations, to go to Poland?</p>

        <p>Yeah, I was in Prague, but the rules are just about the same all over Czechia. Funny thing is that I went to Prague from the UK in the summer because things were practically normal back then in Czechia. It was a relief when I arrived.  Then it descended into dystopia, lockdown since September, and now health papers and tests at every turn.</p>
<p>My stand is that I want nothing to do with this medical tyranny, not even being poked in the nose for a test (unless I'm feeling sick). So, not willing to take a test for travel, I had very few options. Albania was one, but Poland was far easiest to reach by train, and I thought I needed to make the move before covid passports in June/July.  So far I'm very happy I made the move. Poland is chilled out. Walking by a cafe knowing it was illegal for me to sit there in Prague just constantly pissed me off.</p>
<p>I don't speak a word of Polish.  I'm a digital nomad / web developer so I'm kinda used to moving around. I used to do it just for the fun. Are you in Poland yourself?</p>

        <p>No, I'm in the US ATM. Parents were born in Czech though so speak a bit of it. I just quit my job as software engineer here, looking to go nomadic myself. Was planning on leaving the US right about the time COVID hit, and so I thought I'd wait it out, thinking it was gonna be a month or two. About a year later and here I still am.</p>
<p>My options are pretty limited right now as to where I can travel, and I don't know how much longer I want to wait for this COVID thing to settle. I could apply for CZ citizenship, but that's a long process and wouldn't be able to get the necessary paperwork for another year anyway. </p>
<p>If Prague is anything like you say it is, then forget it. I'm looking into South America (took a vacation to Ecuador a few months back which was nice) but would rather be in Europe TBH. </p>
<p>I guess we'll see...</p>
