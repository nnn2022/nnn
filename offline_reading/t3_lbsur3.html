    <strong>I can’t cope with this anymore</strong>
    <p><p>I coped fairly well in January but the depression has hit me bad today. I have no motivation to do anything. I force myself to workout and do a few productive things each day but it’s all so boring I hate it. I have been meeting friends once a week but whenever I leave the house now I feel strongly dissociated. I’m worried when I do go travelling again I’m going to find it overwhelming and not cope with it. I hate this country so much (UK). I find it so dull, weather constantly shit, boring landscapes and now there is nothing to do with lockdown. </p>
<p>I went trespassing in abandoned buildings just to explore something new and it felt so good not being so safe all the time. I know it’s going to be like this in the UK for the next few years. I refuse to waste my early twenties here. I’m trying to find a country that I can go to that won’t make me two week quarantine. Now it’s illegal to go on international holidays so I don’t know how I’m going to come up with an excuse to leave. </p>
<p>So my plan is to find a warm country and just live off my savings, stay in hostels and camping so I can live for cheap. Another winter lockdown will destroy me. </p>
<p>Has anyone else escaped the UK? What advice can you give me.</p></p>

        <p>Hey... I’m 25 and stuck in a cold, gray place too, but across the pond. Perhaps you didn’t come here for a pep talk, but I recommend for you to start “planting seeds” to prioritize your happiness and well-being (save up $ to move, limit negative media, keep exercising, see your friends more frequently) - it will help you focus on the big picture and will hopefully help keep you from getting too bummed out. That’s if you’re serious about turning things around. You might not be hearing and seeing it from those in control of government, media, medicine, etc., but take it from an actual person: all of this will get better. Right now it seems like it will never end, but there are better days ahead. Control what you can, and don’t allow what you can’t control to take over your thoughts and feelings. As above, so below. You are the one steering the ship, so do your best not to let this shit get to you. Rooting for you brother/sister.</p>
