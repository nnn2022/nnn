    <strong>A Personal Rant/Story</strong>
    <p><p>tl:dr scared doctor runs, 'rona has gone too far.</p>
<p>I suspect I have myoclonus, (like restless leg syndrome- TONS of people have it) its heavily affecting my sleep (which is already disturbed due to PTSD- shoutout to my GWOT holmes) ). I call the Doc, I get an appointment 2 weeks later. 
It was for 8, I'm there at 7:50. Mask on. I wait an hour, 9am- Dr. comes. I go to the office, have a sit.</p>
<p>I tell him I've self harmed and self medicated myself to sleep. I become emotional at this point, I unhook one ear, and the Doctor runs out of the office yelling he can't be there without my mask on. So I yelled back okay I'll put it back- but he's gone. I come around a corner and hes hiding behind the secretary desk/plastic shield. I  snap at this point. I felt betrayed and fucked-off after I told him what I was thinking about .. and then no heads up about having to leave or anything, ya know? I looked like the bad guy. Big time. Not helping the situation.. I go in the black, I cussed, and admittedly I broke a coral thing? and left. While doing so, I heard a lady say call the cops- perfect.</p>
<p>The most maddening thing is, its not about treating medical problems anymore. The Doctors are so scared of the 'Rona or possibly the repercussions of breaking protocol, they neglect patients real problems and issues. Everything plays second fiddle to the 'Rona.</p>
<p>This is a military hospital and I am a veteran struggling- especially lately, and it feels like these people don't care at all and certainly not enough to deescalate a situation. 
It's no secret our numbers aren't doing so hot, and this is the treatment as of late.</p>
<p>-And yes the cops, good. Stunning track record these guys have dealing with people in duress.</p>
<p>I had to rant. I hope our Normal returns for everyones sake. We are losing too much.</p></p>

        <p>If you want a fellow veteran to rant with/to, I could ask my mom if she would be willing for me to share some of her contact information with you in a PM. She is a Marine Corps veteran, has seen through the circus act for the entire last year, while having to deal with going to over 150 appointments at the VA last year. </p>
<p>Either way, hope you're in a better emotional place than you were in that moment. I don't know what it's like to have PTSD, so I can't imagine what that experience must have been like for you ðŸ˜”</p>
