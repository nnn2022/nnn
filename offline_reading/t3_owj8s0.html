    <strong>Options for someone whos university mandates the vaccine / counteracting the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>My boyfriend is going to grad school in the Fall, and his university mandates the COVID-19 vaccine. (So does mine, so despite my apprehensiveness, I got the one dose and 4 months later have debilitating neurological side effects; this is my burner account, and given I've posted about the very specific side effects on my regular account, I don't want to tie the two accounts together. One day I'll post as myself, and boy what I've going through and the suppression I've faced is quite the story lol, feel free to DM me). Anyway:</p>
<p>He is very nervous about the long-term effects, as are all of us. He's afraid the spike proteins wont go away, and that his immune system may never recover. He's going to try to submit for a religious exemption, but if that doesn't work, he literally has to take it. So just wondering what his options are - are there any supplements/regiments that detoxify the body after the vaccine or neutralize the processes happening? Idk if that makes sense but basically we just want to try and counter any potential effects of the vaccine. So any advice on that would be perfect. Any advice on maybe what to write in the religious exemption would be great. </p>

<p>Really appreciate this page, glad there are some like-minded people who are awake to what's going on. You guys give me hope in a dark, scary world :)</p></p>
