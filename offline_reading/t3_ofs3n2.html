        <p>Yeah this dude is generally seen as a nutcase and his popularity has taken a nosedive since he started spouting this kind of nonsense. All he's doing is desperately clinging on to his radicalized following. None of the other parties in parliament want to work with them, which is inconvenient for him since he controls 5 seats out of 150. His party also cannot stop splintering because, again, he's a nutcase. He's gone through scandal after scandal in the last two years, was kicked out of his own party, got back in a day later, saw several key members leave and start their own parties, with more people splitting off after the elections which has made him lose some seats. He hardly ever shows up in parliament to take part in debates (which is, y'know....his job), but spends a lot of time on Twitter doing a very bad impression of Donald Trump. He also got boo'd on stage earlier today at a massive protest farmers were doing against some legislation. </p>
<p>He also did not successfully ridicule anyone but himself by just mindlessly repeating hot takes he read on Twitter. This is the guy you're applauding. There is no end to the hilarity coming from this sub.</p>
