    <strong>The Fate of Doomers is Only To Be Used and Be Lab Rats For Their Masters, Who is Fauci and Government. That's What They Have Come in This Life For.</strong>
    <p><p>Ahh, after observing many of you irl and on reddit, all of you are the same. Fat, lazy, unambitious and who had no lives prior to covid. You fools only find virtue and happiness in being lab rats to test whatever your Master, who is the government and fauci commands you to. You doomers love virtue signaling us if we protest or don't mask, yet, you all are sitting in your homs and hoping this covid nonsense doesn't end. Why? Because you love those petty government checks and you don't want to go back to your old miserable fucking lives. You blind idiots do not see the economic destruction that is on it's way, and more restrictions that are coming. You fuckers only love getting fucked in the ass hard by your Master. You are their little rag dolls.</p>
<p>You socialists/communists are the lowest of the low and most clownest out of all. You have gave up your freedom, basic rights and honor for a fucking disease which has a 99.7% survival rate. Are you that dumb to give up everything for this? Masks don't do shit (many studies done on this) and social distancing is dividing Us more than ever, and people literally fear each other now. If I was to social distance Myself from anyone, that would be from you worthless doomers. </p>
<p>You conveniently overlook suicides, people being denied medical treatment in favor/fear of Covid, victims being locked up with their abusers, small businesses going under, government's growing tyranny with power and blatantly flaunting their own rules, your friends and families collective-mental health plummeting, children's education and development suffering, and the figures and statistics from States like Florida and Texas which have gone down, in your , borderline psychopathic endorsement of lockdowns and face masks. </p>
<p>You Doomer's only ambition in life is to obey, bow down and be a slave to the government and to add the cherry on top, you will quad mask to please your Masters even more. And oh, also, to be their lab rats to test this experimental vaccine for them, not knowing the long term side effects of it. And, for the ones who obediently took the vaccine and still are double masking and social distancing, WTF. How fucking stupid you have to be to do that? And yet you still virtue signal Us, while you are only making fool of yourselves. Your Master Fauci and his crew are laughing their asses off rn looking at you and I bet it's hard for them to believe how easy it is to brainwash and manipulate this clown society for their own gain.</p>
<p>And for the people on this Sub, we didn't come in to this world to be fucking lab rats. We came here for a purpose, and to do whatever the hell we want to do, and have freedom in this "free" country who promised Us that. There is no high in living just a boring and simple life and submitting to the government, rather life is a wonderful adventure and no 1 should be able to stop Us. I personally like to live My life on the edge, and Idgaf about death and love to take all the risks. Time is very limited here and life is very short, we must make the most of it and do whatever we want in this limited time. No fucking 1 should be able to take our basic rights away. Fuck them. And you doomers, go back to your old miserable lives, who's only source of happiness is by telling others to quad mask.</p></p>

        <p>Doomer mask enforcers are the in-person manifestation of online cancel culture.  They get off on group shaming people who disagree with them in order to express their moral superiority.  Watch them next time you encounter, they always look around to others for approval and support.</p>
