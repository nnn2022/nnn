        <p>This is an older study (march 29 2020), but it marks a point in diagnosing Covid where the PCR was positive, but also they were able to get postive results for other respiratory illness and influenza. The conclusion was drawn that it was BOTH corvid and another illness.</p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Brown and his colleagues analyzed 562 people recently tested for COVID-19 at <a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-clinics/emergency-department-1199-welch.html">Stanford Health Care’s Marc and Laura Andreessen Emergency Department</a>. Forty-nine of those people tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Of the 562 people, 517 were also tested for the presence of other  common respiratory viruses, such as influenza A and B, respiratory  syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus and several types of pneumonia.  One hundred and twenty seven received a positive result for one of these  other respiratory viruses. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Of the people tested for both SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory  viruses, eleven people — or about 22% of the 49 confirmed COVID-19 cases  and 8.7% of the 127 people with other respiratory viruses — were found  to be co-infected with both kinds of viruses.</p>

&rt;We  performed 562 SARS-COV-2 tests in our ED up to March 17th 2020. Of  these 562 patients, 181 were also tested for Flu A/B/RSV and 336 tested  with RESPCR2 panel.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Of the 562 patients, 127 (22.6%) were positive for other viruses. (24.5% if we use 181+336 = 517 as denominator).</p>
<p>The flu's not gone... it's right there!</p>
