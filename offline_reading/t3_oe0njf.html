    <strong>Why are we not brainwashed ? Its not like we’re special</strong>
    <p><p>Why do so many people believe this stuff ? Why can’t they just think about the reality of our world ? Why are they persuaded by anything on tv? Why do people not see ? </p>
<p>I say this because im an average person and individual . There is nothing special about me . Not a main character or anything . So why is it like this ?</p></p>

        <p>I know this might come off arrogant as fuck but this is how I see it: </p>
<p>People who are conscious about owning the responsibility of their own actions, are more likely to question everything. Since everything they do is taken as their own doing, it is up to them to be well informed before making a decision. They don't surrogate their personal responsibility to "the Government" or to "Science™" or "The experts".</p>

        <p>Personally I was "critically" hurt/wounded psychologically in my early 20s by the health "care" system after blindly trusting "professionals" my whole life (caused by medications that I was lazily/carelessly put on/experimented on with - because they don't actually know how medications like SSRIs work and they've somehow convinced society their experimentation on each person is acceptable); I lost trust of everything, even myself at one point, and from there I had to be hypervigilant to watch and question everything to understand all nuance, and only as I learned (including starting practices to help me cope and destress, like a yoga practice) did my PTSD begin to calm - did my baseline stress level begin to lower. This process allowed me to understand systems, to not place full blame on any individual - many who I was rightfully angry at - but who they themselves were arguable victims of the systems and status quo autonomous processes that form and evolve slowly over time; it reminds me of how Jordan Peterson describes the use and necessity of both Liberal minded and Conservative - and how extremes at both ends aren't good: extreme creativity and too rapid of change then you break systems that will cause too much harm, extreme stagnancy of maintaining the status quo means we can't learn or integrate improvement into these systems - you need to find the porridge that's just the right temperature, the bed that's just the right size; Goldilocks and The Three Bears children's story for those not remembering the reference.</p>
<p>So I wonder if extreme trauma (relative to the person's sensibilities) is the perhaps the impetus to whether a person will question or not, or perhaps it's also part in parcel if there's active or strong enough oppression or suppression by their caretakers, parents or perhaps teachers - if they're supported in exploring their thought, or their trauma, or if not supported and so then so their ego mind forms a shell as a coping mechanism setting boundaries of what type of thought and feeling is acceptable; it reminds me of a friend I have/had in Hong Kong, a police officer there - who I had met years ago, was a very physically rigid man, as did many Chinese seem to be, not relaxed - where he clearly wasn't into creative thinking, brainstorming, or questioning - and he unfortunately (or perhaps as a self-protective/survival mechanism, perhaps conscious but likely subconscious)  has bought into all of the CCP narratives and the control on thinking that creates; unable to explore higher level or systems thinking to understand the dynamic and pitfalls of censorship-control/tyranny vs. democracy-relative freedom.</p>
<p>Re: 'They don't surrogate their personal responsibility to "the Government" or to "Science™" or "The experts".'</p>
<p>Is this the same as learned helplessness then?</p>

<p>Uh, are you me? I had a very similar experience. Was prescribed SSRIs at age 12. They severely messed me up. Not only did they change my entire personality in the worst ways, but they also caused me to become suicidal and self-harm, something I'd never done before that. They made me violent, too. </p>
<p>They know now that these drugs aren't good for kids. This is why I say fuck the FDA and we should stop with this "It isn't FDA approved" crap. It doesn't matter if the FDA approves it. FDA-approved drugs harm people all the time.</p>

        <p>Yes. I embraced personal responsibility because my childhood traumas taught me that a lot of what adults say about life is bullshit, which meant that I was going to have to figure out life for myself.</p>
<p>As a very young kid, I remember people saying that doctors are here to help. That we can trust them. That they have answers. But my experiences said otherwise. As I suffered through my endless health issues and pain, I saw that doctors didn't have answers, at least not for me. Not only that, but they often hurt me with their guessing games, throwing random medications at the problem, and making everything worse. It took me years to undo the damage caused by the doctors of my childhood. </p>
<p>Experiences like this at a young age make it so you don't have the option of being a sheep. I had to take responsibility for my health and learn how to heal myself or I was literally going to die before the age of 25.</p>

        <p>I think this is it, completely. It’s a complete lack of self responsibility. They just want someone to hold their land through life, tell them it’s okay, and lie to them during the process. </p>

        <p>I’ve always looked after my health. I cook meals from scratch with wholefoods. I exercise regularly (have done for over 40 years). I researched into respiratory tract infections when I learned this was the most serious aspect of Covid (back in very early 2020, pre-market crash). I vigilantly checked my vitamin D levels and it’s been even a priority to ensure I’m getting daily sunshine. I have a RRR of around 97% from hospitalization from Covid merely from being vitamin D sufficient. I’m also not fat, and I am active (obesity and inactivity are two other factors that increase likelihood of not only serious Covid symptoms, but other diseases). As I actually take responsibility for my health, I don’t just automatically line up to have an EUA vaccine. I do my research. I’ve decided not to take such a vaccine because the benefits of doing so are infinitesimally small whereas there are at the very least unknown risks. The way I see it I’m working a lot harder in keeping myself out of hospital than some fat lazy slob who happens to be double vaccinated. That person is still at risk for a whole host of diseases, including Covid. They probably don’t even realize they can still contract and spread the virus.</p>

        <p>I worked in national political media for almost a decade before I moved on about a year after trump was elected. I just couldn’t take it anymore. The people who write our “news” are some of the dumbest, most unimpressive people I’ve ever met. They sit around all day sniffing each others farts on Twitter, but they think they are smarter than everyone else because they consume so much of their own bullshit all day. </p>
<p>A lot of media outlets don’t even call their staff reporters or journalists anymore. They are content creators. The vast majority of the shit that gets churned out by corporate media is just noise. It doesn’t mean anything.</p>

        <p>25 years ago I worked as a producer for a local TV newscast. (I’m not proud of this, I should’ve just dealt drugs or become a prostitute.)</p>
<p>Before I got hired I figured this industry can’t be as facile as it looks: there must be more to it than pretty people reading teleprompters. </p>
<p>It’s nothing but pretty people reading teleprompters. My then-coworkers remain by far the stupidest people I’ve ever worked with, or ever will.</p>

        <p>Not true, at least for me. Now I do it even more to try and predict what's their next move.</p>
<p>The very first red flag regarding all this was in march 2020, where I found myself <em>agreeing</em> on what they were saying on tv. Soon after, statistically relevant data on IFR came out, and I knew for sure this was all bullshit.</p>

        <p>Were you raised with parents that used the "because I said so" card a lot? Because in other comment I explained how the lack of that frase in my household tended to separate me as the "rebel" in front of authority figures like teachers simply because I asked for reasons behind their commands. </p>
<p>That's just my thoughts on it, though, I realised a lot of parents went for the lazy appeal to authority method and theorized many children must be internalising it as "figures of authority don't need to explain their reasoning to me and questioning it will be met with scorn"</p>

        <p>Holy sh!t you just blew my mind and connected dots I didn't even realize where there!! My mother is a "because I said so parent". From the second I came out she said all I ever asked was why. Why do this instead of that, why is it that way instead of this? I HAVE ALWAYS ASKED THE QUESTIONS. Makes sense now why I do it and my entire career is about asking the question why and proving how. Thank you for the brain wrinkles.</p>

        <p>This is a great point. My mother refused to punish us or lay out rules - almost to a fault. We were always taught to question authority. Due to her toxic experiences with religion, she is incapable of professing confidence in one particular worldview.</p>
<p>She has some deep-seated issues for sure, but as a result she is fervently anti-lockdown and honestly, when I see other moms with their “let’s get vaccinated!!1!11!” Facebook banners, I’m actually grateful I was raised in such an insecure, anxious and ideologically unstable household.</p>

<li>less than normal fear of social outcasting and mocking.</li>
<li>perhaps less deeply afraid in march 2020... even if I died, I felt at peace with God.</li>
<li>not ashamed of anything I did or didnt do in the initial panic... i don't need to lie to myself to protect my sense of self</li>
<li>was offline no wifi, no laptop, no phone during the initial panic. i was scared but drew close to god and trusted my feelings on things and then felt very peaceful and calm</li>
<li>never felt "real" to me, though I was very cautious around elders especially coz i didnt want to test my intution on it</li>
<li>data didn't make sense in march 2020 (no general population sampling to determine actual spread or severity... didnt think it was a deliberate error at the time, just stupid)</li>
<li>I have a natural knack for formal logic and debate... loved these subjects in school</li>
<li>read lots of books in general - lots of history books and autobiographies from people who survived (or didnt) totalitarianism... read "the future is history" about russia's fall back into totalitarianism by Masha Gessen in feb 2020</li>
<li>been thru abuse, forceful confinement, stockholm syndrome, ptsd and counselling after to make sense of what happened and why</li>
<li>im a spiritual person, have insightful dreams ahead of events, do journeying, read cards, etc. to help "go with the flow" of life instead of fighting it as much as possible</li>
<li>experienced long term iatrogenic illness and know what a shit show the med and pharma industry are under the veneer of prestige and professionalism</li>
<li>never finished my degree due to illness above, but majored in philosophy and religious studies. By April 1st 2020, I reconized COVID was developing characteristics of a religion</li>
<li>loved orwell as a teen, and the early COVID propaganda sounded straight out of 1984.. i didnt think it was intentional just incompetent PR officials oblivious of how orwellian they sounded</li>
<li>I'm fairly open minded and curious, not afraid to consider intellectually taboo hypothesis. I'm confident in my intelligence and my self worth isn't threatened by being seen as dumb or being wrong about an idea, so I can entertain a lot of different theories and it doesn't impact my sense of self</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that's all</p>

        <p>6 played a huge role for me as well. The fact that they were presenting raw cases, which are incredibly biased and not so informative, made me question everything. Anyone with a data/stats background would it call out and no one did, even in the government. At that moment I concluded that the experts were either asleep, silent, or silenced. From then on I knew I had to think for myself</p>

        <p>yea, I had a bad cold at the time and I remember looking it up to see how I could get tested... the answer was that I didn't qualify to be tested. They were only testing people who were coming to the hospital with respiratory infections.</p>
<p>Same with all the stuff in the second wave "covid is infecting the heart now!" "covid is impacting the liver :o" ... that's just what you get when all your data comes heart attack patients in the emergency ward.  </p>

        <p>You have to understand the goals of the ruling class. Brainwashing is a major tactic they use to control the masses. These people plan over centuries what they're trying accomplish. They don't want us to be free; that's not in their interests. They want us to fight amongst ourselves so we never figure out the true source of the problem while they are siphoning wealth and power away from everyone on earth. These people are incredibly powerful and literally own almost every country on earth. Politicians and bankers are just puppets to the true rulers and we are just pawns in their much larger game.</p>

        <p>Brainwashing alone is not sufficient as there will always be disbelievers, that is where the heavy hitters come in and gang you up and beat you up or even kill you. On the internet it is harder to do but they can shut you up by killing you online like banning you. You can still see what is going on but you will have no means to voice out your concerns. You might say hey i can open another account, but sadly one day even america will become a police state like china, so you can lose your internet access if you have low social credit scores.</p>
<p>Things remained the same while technology advanced. This is the same thousand year old tactics human kind has been using.</p>

        <p>I remember reading that around 10% of the population are highly susceptible to hypnotic suggestion, 10% cannot be hypnotised, and everyone else falls somewhere in the middle.  My personal hypothesis is that your susceptibility to hypnotic suggestion correlates to your susceptibility to social programming.  We are the 10% whose brains resist the programming.</p>

        <p>Women as a whole are very suggestible and agreeable. They are conformist and prone to collectivism. Their emotions trump rationality and facts. This is why they push for women to occupy positions of power. They would be the easiest to control. Women, given the right to vote will most likely vote left thus ushering in socialism because they innately seek out providers (be it a male or an institute). The state has effectively used women’s selfishness as a weapon to extort men out of their wealth. 
So would it be sexist to say its in society’s best interest to prohibit or severely  restrict feminine individuals (a man can also be feminine) from partaking in politics?</p>

        <p>Found it.  My numbers were slightly off, but here it is:</p>
<p>"Next, subjects are administered a series of test suggestions, graded from easy to difficult, similar to those shown in Figure 15-4, and their objective and subjective responses are scored as present or absent. Finally, a total score is computed and compared with published norms for each scale. Across scales, approximately 10% to 15% of subjects fall into the “high hypnotizability” range, another 15% to 20% fall in the “low hypnotizability” range, and the remainder fall in an intermediate range."</p>

        <p>After speaking to someone who is still terrified and believes all the variant stuff and hates "anti vaxxers" I think a lack of curiosity and a trust in institutions has a lot to do with it. I have always wanted to know details about how things work in all sorts of subject matter. People with lazy minds have called me annoying... Told me "just because" when there is no answer to something. I thing conforming to fit in and remain in the mainstream echo chamber and not be an outcast plays into this as well.</p>
<p>I have always been the kind of person that fits in everywhere but I don't really belong at the same time, if that makes sense. I can get along with just about anyone and I can fit in anywhere, most people take a liking to me I'm a very outgoing fun person but I have always felt like I really didn't belong anywhere. From outward appearances i seem like the typical average person, I have absolutely no problem  making friends and making connections with other people and I love socializing and being around others but that there have been many times when I almost feel as if I was sent here to observe others. I don't feel a part of things a lot of the time. I think it's that weird analytical quality In me that brought me to this place in our current situation.</p>
<p>I also have a very strong bullshit meter and I can pick up on people lying pretty easily. If I feel that something is off in my gut it's absolutely impossible for me to ignore it.</p>

        <p>For me, I've never trusted anyone (which causes other problems in life) and had reason to do so.</p>
<p>I've always been a curious person and was a curious child always looking for answers to things.</p>
<p>I've always been fascinated with patterns and numbers and was always good at math and noticing things out of place.</p>
<p>I believe noticing patterns has helped me to use a lot of common sense and notice things are out of place, don't make sense, contradict, go against logic, etc. and never buy into bullshit that the media and politicians, and fake "experts" are selling.</p>

        <p>Ive got a real head cracker for you. People claim that the bible is a non-fictional book and should be taken literal. It’s prophecy about the mark of the beast seems to come true. It states that people will need the mark of the beast on their forehead or right arm to do be able to buy and sell stuff. Now it’s evident that the vaccine passport they are pushing will soon be required to partake in society. Just like the bible foretold. I’m not religious at all but I agree that this technology is eerily similar to what is described in scripture. </p>
<p>Marinade on this: is it just a coincidence or fate/prophecy if someone read the bible and took inspiration out of it and did their darnest to make it a reality? Would it still have come to past if that passage didn’t exist in the bible?</p>
<p>A real head scratcher. Science fiction is a source of inspiration for scientist. So now would things that were written in science fiction book be the product of said writers ability to seen probable futures or do they merely  possess a wild imagination? Shouldn’t the genre be more accurately be renamed to science prediction/future?</p>

        <p>Oh I just saw the trailer. It's probably not on youtube anymore it had like 2 million views if I remember correctly. The movie was not finished. But the trailer is enough. I was already aware of some conspiracies, but I had my doubts. The past year pretty much confirmed everything I feared. A great documentary that everyone should watch is Endgame from Alex Jones. It's still on youtube.</p>

<p>Some people never question the system, however if the system did little for you or you have struggled a bit in life, why trust it? I've seen a class division among the "obedient", aka working class and poorer less likely to go along with it. I also would fathom that many African Americans don't trust this stuff and aren't lining up for the vaxx given their history like Tuskagee. The system made promises it doesn't deliver to the lower classes. The professional class lines right up, their status in society is high based on their conformity, and most of the time there were "rewards" for compliance. For those on the "hard knock life" trail, they know a lot of the world is based on lies and people on the "make".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some question things, read, think. I lived without TV for 5 years in my youth always wonder if that broke the spell so was able to see outside of the "matrix".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some parenting styles and histories influence. Good parents that promote critical thinking in some cases, in other cases, Mom and Dad so awful or abusive, the only way to survive is to rebel, and question authority becomes a way of life. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people are natural conformists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are using mind control, suggestion and brainwashing techniques. Ever hear of Delphi? One can hear it in the language they use, even the "double blind" bs where they bring up things that contradict each other. The destabilization and lies help, people throw up their hands and then let others do the thinking for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe spiritual reasons, some do take spirituality more seriously, connection to divine/God, don't march along as a robot, question things. Even a questioning atheist may have more "spirituality" to them then someone who just conforms to whatever religion their parents were, without thinking about it or their place in the universe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my case, I believe autism helped me be less brainwashed. I've always been an independent thinker, though I have definitely have my limitations. I do ask myself if I am wrong. I know I am being lied to about this mess in general, and sure of that.</p>

        <p>Even though I assume this is meant to be sarcastic, I'm starting to believe there's some validity to this. From a religious perspective, some people actually lose their humanity little by little (or really quickly, like while committing hideous acts like rape, murder, etc.) and they become more of an animal. It's like the opposite of evolution. Humans are made to be active and use our brains, two things which so many people absolutely do not partake in these days. So maybe they're becoming slightly less human, and morphing slowly into actual sheep.</p>

        <p>I taught myself graphic design when I was 13 so I could help my parents with their small business. I realized immediately that everything that seemed official was just bullshit. The news isn’t true just because of the fonts they use or the flashy graphics on screen or even a professional tone of voice. I can paste in the government logo just as easily as the government can. Type out a vague letter, sign it with a scribble, and suddenly I’m a doctor! We aren’t trapped in a simulation inside a computer. Real life is the simulation. Everything we’re told and sold is make believe. Just like a movie set.</p>
<p>Most people have no interest in knowing who’s behind the curtain in Emerald City. Ignorance is bliss. Maybe it helps that I’m too jaded for bliss? Perhaps if there were any happiness in my life, I too would fear the truth.</p>

        <p>We possess the ability to think critically.  We ask questions, we listen to our intuition.  We don't take things at face value, and know when we are being conned or manipulated. I think we are special. It's been brutal on here today dealing with pissed off 4th of July hating, radical liberal idiots.  I had more then 1 tell me they had no idea the audits were happening in AZ.  One kid asked for proof, lol!! 1 tell me he used Flakka, and that his buddies supply Gen Flynn and Donald Trump on the sly. FLAKKA mind you...then called me delusional when I told him that the elections audits look good for Trump.  The left is so far out there it really all radicals, no in between at all.</p>

        <p>The people who keep going along with this are comfortable, always have been. Just living comfy little lives. "Just wear a mask, what's the big deal?!" Those type of people think if they just do as they are told by their benevolent government everything will go back to normal, and they can continue to live their comfortable lives. I've got bad news for them...</p>
<p>The people who see through this nonsense struggled and fought their whole lives to get where they are. The people who have actually had their lives partially or completely destroyed by this psy-op are the people who refuse to stand for it, and will fight to keep what they earned, and deserve to have for their efforts. That's who we are.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it's class warfare. The haves still have and haven't been affected in any significant way, the have nots that fought to get what they <em>had</em> refuse to have it stolen from them over a fake pandemic.</p>

        <p>1) People are <em>way</em> dumber than I thought in 2019. Like, <em>way</em> dumber. Most of them are literally unable to wire cause and effect together by themselves, they need the tv to know what they're supposed to think. They're completely lost by themselves.</p>
<p>2) Apart from being dumb, people are herd animals. While I suspect people in here have a very strong sense of the self, a shockingly high amount of people out there are really not their own person. After 2020, that NPC meme doesn't feel like satire anymore. That's why hard facts and data do not work on them - if anything, they just get angrier at you when you force them into a corner. You can't be right, the herd is right. The TV is the shepherd. Public opinion is their opinion - it's not that they hide it in public, they have <em>no</em> opinion which is really their own. Note that this has nothing to do with intelligence or academic training.</p>

        <p>For me:</p>
<p>I was into conspiracies before the pandemic started, so I was very aware of how big the government lies can get. Also, I remember in January 2020 seeing videos of Chinese people collapsing on the street with hazmats cleaning them up. This also never happened in the Netherlands . Maybe the virus was incredibly deadly in the beginning and quickly mutated into a less deadly version, or it was just fear propaganda. Also, I worked in a grocery store the whole year of 2021 and the first 7 months no one wore a mask, so I realized the masks were nonsense too. Then, when you see how they did everything they possibly could to shame/judge people into their cult, it was clear. Finally, the truth fears no questions. And these covid cultists fear all the questions.</p>

<p>- a lifetime of the right sort of eye-opening experiences</p>
<p>- acceptance of the feeling of being disliked/not fitting in. </p>
<p>- an inherent ability to think critically and for myself.</p>

        <p>I remember, distinctly, a hypnotist that came to our small town school when I was in 8th grade.  He gave a demonstration, used volunteers, and ended the 'show' by doing a bit of mass hypnosis.  He explained about the power of suggestion and how some people are ore susceptible than others, and that there are some who cannot be hypnotized... or at the very least, are quite difficult to hypnotize.  </p>
<p>So he does his bit, and he asks the entire middle school and high school in the auditorium to stand up.  That was a normal request, so everyone stood up.  The mass hypnotism came when he told everyone to sit down in some outlandish, weird way.  I can't remember the exact manner but you knew it was different from simply asking you to stand up if you wanted to participate.</p>
<p>Myself and maybe four other kids remained standing.</p>
<p>He then pointed out that everyone who complied had been hypnotized and those of us remained standing were not susceptible to the power of suggestion - that we would be the ones to not blindly follow.  </p>
<p>I keep going back to that and wondering if my lack of compliance and defiance of authority then, and now, is what has kept me from falling into the hysteria... and if the hysteria is a bit of mass hypnosis, the power of suggestion.</p>

        <p>I'm not convinced that it is all so many people actually believing this stuff.</p>
<p>I've recently seen a video about this experiment where they showed people lines with different length. 5 were actors who agreed on the same wrong line to be the shortest and one person was an actual test-subject.</p>
<p>Depending on how the actors acted to the other person disagreeing with them, relatively high rates of the test-subject agreeing with the obviously wrong answer were reached.</p>
<p>So I think a lot of people are afraid of showing that they actually came to a different conclusion than what they perceive as the majority which actually isn't a majority at all. So they "agree" on the outside because they want to go the path of the least resistance.</p>
<p>Even I myself am at times affected by that and wear a mask inside of stores that mandate it, making it look like I agree, when in reality I'm just doing it to avoid conflict.</p>
<p>It's basically the "if you are few, appear many"-strategy right out of Sun-Tzu's art of war.</p>

        <p>This is called sheep mentality. An extreme example would be eating shit, if everyone around you are enjoying eating shit and saying they taste great and smells nice, you would be more inclined to test it yourself just to see if what they claim is indeed true, something under normal circumstances you wouldn't even consider. So now you had your first taste of shit, how does it feel? Obviously it taste bad and awful, but everybody is saying there is something wrong about you, because shit tastes great and is very beneficial for your health. You might not believe it right away, but as days passed, weeks passed, years passed and you face the same criticism by everyone everyday, one day you would start to doubt yourself and that is when they have won and you have lost your identity. You now acknowledge that shit tastes great and is good for health and start to promote shit eating to others that are similar to who you once were. As time goes by, more and more people believe in shit eating, the few remnants will be deemed insane and blasphemous, and we all know what ensures, they get hunted down, forced to practice shit eating and acknowledge shit taste great, or get crucified.</p>

        <p>As a vegan I can say, that this is more or less exactly how I imagine how eating dead animals became so popular. :o</p>
<p>I did it as a child because everyone else did it despite not liking it.</p>
<p>I didn't stop it when I became aware that there's people who don't do it. I only stopped when I became aware that I too could be one of the people who don't do it.</p>
<p>And the moment I came to that realization wasn't before someone actually asked me about my stance on it.</p>

        <p>Same goes for the LBGT community. When they were small group it is ok, we let them do whatever they please, but as they grew bigger and bigger and became more contagious, you can see they are trying to force their ways in, asking for equal rights etc, when for example it is clearly not equal when a guy turned girl can now compete in girls only sports which gives disadvantage over real girls. Oh and did i mention that if you call them guys turned girl i or calling real girls real girls it would be discrimination towards them? Same goes for religious groups, in fact, it is the same for everything as we are all humans.</p>

        <p>Now that you mention that.<br>
I'm very suspicious that pharmaceutical contraceptives have such a strong impact on the hormonal-makeup that they may impact sexual preferences and also other character-traits.</p>
<p>I mean if a contraceptive, in addition of preventing ovulation, makes you not want to mate with males anymore, it drastically increases it's overall effectiveness in preventing births.</p>

        <p>I used to think I was a collectivist and I had the right qualities to fit into this type of society. Then I saw collectivism for what it really is, and I realized it's not much different from a backwards religious cult. While I've always been respectful of other people and never liked disturbing the peace in any way, I've never been prone to groupthink and I'm somewhat mistrustful of authority. People started getting nasty in summer 2020, tensions rose, the collectivist spell faded away and I snapped out of it.</p>

        <p><strong>FALSE. You are a unique person with thoughts and dreams. An individual.</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of your beliefs, you are either</p>
<p>Created in the image of God, and everything that entails</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>You are a product of 3.75 Billion years of evolution - countless dice rolls, mutations, deaths, matings, challenges, obstacles, devastation</p>
<p>- and here you are.</p>
<p>Either way, <strong>you are quite the creation, or quite the result. Look how far you've come to be here!</strong></p>
<p>However, again - depending on your beliefs,</p>
<p>Both Satan and The Elites, for whatever reason want to diminish you. They want to devalue you. They want you to believe that you are just a speck on a speck of countless specks - insignificant.</p>
<p>Though in a healthy thought stream, this may be humbling, and put things in perspective, but when it's weaponized, it means that you have no value and can easily be discarded like an old newspaper.</p>
<p>Take a look around you. No 2 artists draw the same (Unless they purposefully do it), No 2 singers sing the same.</p>
<p>in 2021, we may use the term 'snowflake' as a pejorative to describe a spoiled, self-entitled, SJW brat - that's because they have taken that concept to narcissistic levels.</p>
<p>In a healthy use of the word 'snowflake' comes from 'no 2 snowflakes are alike', and we are all those snowflakes.</p>
<p>You are you, You are not me.. You are not the other millions.</p>
<p>Extra Note for emphasis: You can be special and unique, and celebrate that, and be completely healthy minded about it. No narcissism or self-centeredness needs to enter that.</p>
<p><strong>Don't believe the World. Their goal is to tear you down, to pull you down, to make you mediocre, to stifle your efforts, to diminish, devalue and ultimately destroy you.  Don't let it happen.</strong></p>
<p>Find like minded and humble people around you that will build you up and not tear you down.</p>
<p>A friendly rivalry or 'competition' should be welcomed. As I said to a good friend who was a fellow artist or w/e  "If we're not making each other at least a bit jealous or go wow how did you do that, we're not doing it right', and then we both get better as a result.</p>

Think about how easy was to get killed for something you think and said it just few decades, for instance when I've born in 1981 just 40 years ago, militars in my country made "disappear" 30.000 people among of them many young ones, for being accused of communists even if many of them there weren't, they just had a friend and being seen around them or something, from torture to killing them with no mercy. 
And the further you go in time the worst. So it kind of make sense that we are the minority.</p>
<p>Another reason is that we are social beings that live in groups, thinking what authority and the herd think somehow makes you non responsible of outcomes, having and different thought than the herd comes up with responsability.
Remember the story of Jesus? He died for your sins, so you're not responsible for them, he already paid for them.
Btw Jesus is another good example of what happen when you speak against the establishment.</p>

<p>It's really a myriad of factors and no matter how much information you put in someone's hands, they can choose to see it from whatever angle they choose to - based on their belief and value systems.</p>
<p>It takes a lot for someone to accept logic against their personal beliefs. OTOH there are people who pulled the curtain and saw the wizard of Oz and now they can't but help themselves question stuff that might not even need questioning. YMMV...</p>

        <p>Honestly, because the brain is just so damn good at what it does. It believes what it hears and then looks for any evidence to back it up. It’s a spiral after that... </p>
<p>Also, add to that the fact that the brain then doesn’t see any opposition to its original information. Because it is censored. </p>
<p>I must say, even though from day 1 of the pandemic (and before), I have thought it was a load of shit, I am still fully open to the idea that it isn’t a load of shit - my brain is just convinced that it is. However, every time I see information censored from the internet etc, I doubt that I’m wrong even more. </p>
<p>I clearly remember saying to someone at the start, when it was all circulating in China and just starting to come onto the news here (UK) - ‘it only spreads on the news’. They all laughed. Lol.</p>

        <p>"" I think ,therefore I am""  </p>
<p>Cogito, ergo sum<br>
“I think; therefore I am” was the end of the search Descartes conducted for a statement that could not be doubted. He found that he could not doubt that he himself existed, as he was the one doing the doubting in the first place. In Latin (the language in which Descartes wrote), the phrase is “Cogito, ergo sum.”</p>

        <p>I read a great essay last year that said there are two types of people:  Conventional Minded and Independent Minded. These are further divided into passive and aggressive. Aggressive Conventional minded would be the blue check marks on Twitter or the Karens in grocery stores, for instance. Most are just passive. </p>
<p>We are the independent minded, both kinds. </p>
<p>Anyway, it’s how I see the world now. My husband and I are the only independent minded ones in our families, we’re also the youngest of a bunch of siblings each, maybe that’s why? It’s interesting to think about. </p>
<p>Here’s the essay, it’s called The Four Quadrants of Conformism. You can tell already in early childhood who you’ll be:  http://paulgraham.com/conformism.html</p>

It also causes stress that most people cannot handle, even more so today with the safe spaces types. These followers will just go along with the crowd without any self reflection.</p>

        <p>I’ve often thought the same thing. It’s <strong>so</strong> common to see “expert psychologists” write that people believe in conspiracy theories because they think they’re smarter than everyone, or they have nothing in their life so this gives them an identity. </p>
<p>I’ve never felt this to be fair, and it certainly doesn’t apply to me. I certainly don’t think I’m smarter than everyone (although, you know obviously brighter than those that double mask on zoom calls) and I have a life too. </p>
<p>I really don’t know why.</p>

        <p>This argument goes both ways. Someone could be saying this exact shit about all of you. It’s like two very devout people with very different religions—each person is completely convinced they are right and the other is insane. There’s a right way about solving those disagreements, and a wrong way.</p>
