    <strong>Masks are dangerous when you're a woman alone with a kid</strong>
    <p><p>Today while waiting for my husband to pick us up, my son and I were verbally abused by a deranged man. He shouted at my son (9 years old) "there's something wrong with you!" . I replied back to him that no, there is something wrong with you. He stormed up to me standing so close that if his stomach had stuck out another centimeter it would have touched me, screaming "what did you say to me? Say that again!".</p>
<p>I did not step back but glared into his eyes and kept asking what my son did wrong to him. He had nothing to say and walked off and shouted "you're a fucking whore!"</p>
<p>All in front of my son. </p>
<p>Another lady with her daughter (about 6 or 7 years old - really tiny) came over to me and said he had done the same to them and threatened the little girl by saying "are you scared of me? Because I'll make you fucking scared of me!" Poor child was clearly shaken by the exchange.</p>
<p>So... when my husband arrived and I told him what had happened, he asked what he looked like because he wanted to report it to security or police. Lol. He was wearing a mask and a hoody. All I know is he had brown eyes. Very fucking helpful.</p>
<p>So this creep will no doubt do this again to another kid and their mom. He knows he can get away with it because it's impossible to identify him.</p>
<p>These mask mandates need to end. They're dangerous, and not just because of oxygen deprivation or bacterial pneumonia.</p></p>

        <p>Because that guy wouldn’t be crazy and rude if he didn’t have a mask? </p>
<p>Because they would definitely have caught him and thrown him in jail for being rude if you had a slightly less vague description of brown eyed man in hoodie?</p>
<p>I mean sorry someone was a jerk to you, but you’re fine and there isn’t suddenly some masked madman epidemic that you need to panic about. Sometimes people are just jerks. Always have been, always will be.</p>
