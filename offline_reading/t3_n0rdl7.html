    <strong>Nice comment showing the dangers/effectiveness of masks with dozens of sources</strong>
    <p><p>Science &rt; media</p>
<p>Dangers of Masks Include but are not limited to:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Physiological::</strong> Hypoxemia, Hypercapnia, shortness of breath, inflammation, self contamination, increased stress and muscle tension, and immunosuppression. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Psychological:</strong> activation of fight or flight response, chronic stress, fear, insomnia, fatigue, and compromised cognitive function. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Health Consequences:</strong> Increased predisposition for viral and infection illnesses, headaches, anxiety, depression, heart disease, Exacerbation of existing conditions and diseases, and premature mortality. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"It should be concluded from these and similar studies that the filter material of face masks does not retain or filter out viruses." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Yet there is no convincing scientific data that supports the effectiveness of masks for respiratory protection" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Masks will always fit fairly loosely with considerable gaps along the cheeks, around the bridge of the nose and along the bottom edge of the mask below the chin." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated."' </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"There have been extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H)." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"In light of the medical research, therefore, it is difficult to understand why public-health authorities are not consistently adamant about this established scientific result, since the distributed psychological, economic, and environmental harm from a broad recommendation to wear masks is significant, not to mention the unknown potential harm from concentration and distribution of pathogens on and from used masks. In this case, public authorities would be turning the precautionary principle on its head" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"By making mask-wearing recommendations and policies for the general public, or by expressly condoning the practice, governments have both ignored the scientific evidence and done the opposite of following the precautionary principle." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"So, at the end of the day, the only thing that provides personal protection for the person wearing the mask is a respirator. And that is the thing that healthcare workers should be wearing" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"My biggest problem with telling people they can wear masks is it gives you this false sense of security. And it might even encourage you to think that now you’re protected and you’re protecting people around you." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"just want them to understand that they aren’t very much more protective than if they weren’t wearing them. And they’re really not doing a whole lot of good for the people around them." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"the wide use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks.” </p>
</li>
