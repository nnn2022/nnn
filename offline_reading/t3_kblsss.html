        <p>I liked this one best:</p>
<p>&rt; Orange, Don Barnes, Dec. 5: “Compliance with health orders is a matter of personal responsibility and not a matter of law enforcement. To put the onus on law enforcement to enforce these orders against law-abiding citizens who are already struggling through difficult circumstances, while at the same time criticizing law enforcement and taking away tools to do our jobs, is both contradictory and disingenuous. As we have done throughout this pandemic, we must remain diligent in preventing the spread of the virus by following public health recommendations, like wearing a face covering and practicing social distancing. Conversely, policy makers must not penalize residents for earning a living, safeguarding their mental health, or enjoying our most cherished freedoms.”</p>

        <p>Unfortunately it doesn't matter if the Sheriff doesn't enforce it if the city police are enforcing it</p>

        <p>It absolutely does matter, and I’m sick of people saying otherwise. </p>
<p>Going against the grain is fucking hard, and almost no one wants to do it - even fewer people want to do it <em>first</em> (or early).  </p>
<p>The people who do it first may not make a difference in the policy... and really, it’s insane to think that they would. </p>
<p>It’s also lazy and cowardly and entitled - we’re here anonymously complaining about lockdowns and protesting the new normal, and someone takes a <em>public stance</em> against enforcing some of this horrid tyranny, and we downplay the significance of their actions because they don’t magically solve all of <strong>our</strong> problems.  We’re assholes, and just as complicit in building this new normal as are the people eagerly embracing it. </p>
<p>You know who isn’t lazy or cowardly or entitled? Who <strong>isn’t</strong> complicit in building this new normal? </p>
<p>These sheriffs - and more broadly, every individual who puts themselves in the line of fire by PUBLICLY speaking out or refusing to comply. </p>
<p>And they make a huge difference. It’s outrageously difficult to go first, to speak up first - but it gets easier as more people do it. </p>
<p><strong>Every person who takes a public stance against lockdowns, mandates, or anything else related to the “new normal” makes it easier for the NEXT person to do so.</strong></p>
<p>These sheriffs - and the scientists and doctors who speak up, the gyms and salons who stay open and incur outrageous fines, the restaurants who keep indoor dining, the store employee who doesn’t berate you for not having a mask, the cop who tells his neighbor that he’s having a big Christmas dinner and everyone is invited, the person who braves a grocery store with their face exposed (gasp!) ... they make it EASIER for the next person to stand up and do the same. </p>
<p>You know what it takes to kill the new normal? A bunch of people following their lead. <strong>That’s literally all it takes.</strong></p>
<p>These sheriffs may not solve the problem by refusing to enforce certain mandates, but they also <em>shouldn’t</em>. We get the world we <strong>collectively</strong> deserve, and right now we collectively deserve the new normal because instead of praising and celebrating these acts of defiance while following their lead and finally ending this madness, we minimize their significance and bemoan the fact that it’s not sufficient. </p>
<p>And in making comments like yours - oh so practical, and technically correct, so you’ll be able to logically defend them as though that makes it right - something magical happens: <strong>you chip away at the power of those actions to influence others.</strong> </p>
<p>People like these sheriffs are acting in a way that exposes them to personal costs and risks, and by doing so are encouraging others to follow their lead. </p>
<p>Then the EXACT FUCKING PEOPLE who are <em>most</em> inclined to follow their lead early on reject that invitation in favor of sending a different message: </p>
<p>&rt; Why bother? <strong>Don’t</strong> bother. It won’t make a difference. There’s no point. Why incur the costs of resistance when it doesn’t matter? </p>
<p>Comments like this actively discourage action against the new normal, with the consequence that you may as well eagerly embrace the new normal. </p>
<p>And don’t worry - <strong>keep up that attitude, continue contributing to a sense of hopelessness and resignation, continue discouraging any action by someone else that doesn’t magically solve everything for you, and you WILL get it. You will also deserve it.</strong></p>

        <p>My comment is more of a criticism of the town police who carry out whatever unconstitutional order they're given because a fair amount of them got into the field because they love the power trip, another large percentage are just there for the good benefits and couldn't give a shit about the constitution, and a third small percentage are genuinely trying to perform a service to their community</p>

        <p>A lot of city police won’t enforce it either.  For example, the San Jose police don’t have the manpower.  The only enforcement that I have heard about is the County Health Officer is sending the restaurant inspector types out to fine businesses.</p>
