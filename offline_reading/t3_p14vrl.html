        <p>They were definitely vaxxed because The Daily Fail would have NEVER missed an opportunity to remind people that the unvaxxed are dying. The fact that they mentioned their underlying conditions is a huge sign that they were indeed vaxxed.</p>

<p>&rt;A double-vaccinated husband and wife who had been married for 50 years have died of Covid-19 within 12 hours of each other after spending 18 months shielding throughout the pandemic because they both had underlying health conditions.</p>
