    <strong>I feel beaten by this now.</strong>
    <p><p>I find it very depressing. This is happening. Question it and you're a tin foil hat wearer. Oblige by the rules and you're willingly passing freedoms away... why?</p>
<p>It's only a holiday... It's only a mask... etc
Why wouldn't you want to work back towards the world we had, rather than to 'build back better'?</p>
<p>Digital IDs. Central Bank crypto and social credit system. That's what's coming.</p>
<p>We need a free press with investigative powers to hold truth to power. We've let this happen. The 1% own the media, they own the narrative.</p>
<p>If we blindly conform to this new normal the future is a prison planet for us and our kids and beyond.</p>
<p>Don't you already see different rules for the elite? The G7 gave you a clue. No tax for CO2 on private planes. Masks for parliamentary staff but not MPs.</p>
<p>This is the future and it's a neo feudal system, with is as digital serfs. You will own nothing, have no privacy, but you will be happy.</p></p>

        <p>Try to remain strong. I've been seeing people questioning now about "if the vaccines aren't going to bring us back to normal, then what will?" and the fact that they're trying extremely hard propaganda shows that they're not 100% achieving their goals, or else they wouldn't be leaning so hard into it.</p>
<p>Something's definitely going to break soon, whether for better or worse. The CDC is finally acknowledging myocarditis, as late as june 2021, so who knows what can happen by December 2021/January 2022, one year after the vaccines officially started mass distributing.</p>
<p>For other times of mass hysteria, look at the salem witch trials of 1692. I'm sure people at the time who lived through that period also felt similarly, but eventually history vindicated that time period. Stay strong, as you are part of the resistance.</p>

        <p>This is why I bought all the shit I needed to before the shamdemic. Now I can just sit and chill in the house or go out for a drive if I want some nature/fresh air.</p>
<p>My suggestion is try and move somewhere that is quite rural as you tend to have more space and personal freedom there. I moved out the city 10 years ago and it was the best thing I ever did.</p>
