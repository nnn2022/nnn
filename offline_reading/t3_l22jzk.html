    <p><p>Just replace "soldiers" with key-workers or something</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business.  I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone  if possible. Jew, Gentile, Black Man, White, we all want to help one  another, human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's  happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise  one another. And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth  is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and  beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has  barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and  bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.  Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has  made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and  feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than  cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities  life will be violent, and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio  have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions  cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood,  for the unity of us all. Even now, my voice is reaching millions  throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little  children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison  innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say do not despair. The  misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness  of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass,  and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return  to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ... </p>
<p>Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you,  enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to  think, and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle,  use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men,  machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not  machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity  in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate, the unloved and  the unnatural! </p>
<p>Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Luke">St Luke</a>  it is written: "the Kingdom of God is within man" not one man nor a  group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power,  the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the  people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make  this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us  use that power, let us all unite! Let us fight for a new world, a decent  world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a  future, and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes  have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise!  They never will! Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people!  Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the  world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with  hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where  science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. </p>
<p>Soldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!</p></p>
