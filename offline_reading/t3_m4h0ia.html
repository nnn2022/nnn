        <p>The poster looked for a fight. Reading that post over and over, it gave the impression that they wanted to fight because they kept addressing trolls with edits over and over. I was like "STOP ADDRESSING THEM, YOU'RE DOING WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO!" </p>
<p>But the addressing of this sub in particular made me think that by now someone would try to set the record straight and someone here made a mention to this post since the poster did a crosslink. As if...is it a he or she who posted it...was asking for allies to come here to brigade this sub or get it banned. Because they directly addressed this sub thinking that maybe it would alert Reddit to something that this sub never actually did to them. Perhaps by addressing this sub that the accusation is there and the OP is indirectly asking for action to be taken that this sub is better prepared in case it does.</p>
