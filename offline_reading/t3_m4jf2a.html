    <strong>I need a free thinker to talk to</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys. I am a long time member of this sub, and I hated the term "New Normal" before this sub even existed. The early commercials in March 2020 used to twist me up viscerally as I know they were doing predictive programming. How could they know this was going to be normalized? This virus could've easily fizzled out like SARS or MERS in a month from what we knew then.</p>
<p>Here's the good news. I live in Florida and the state is wide open. In fact, I live in a little studio 2 blocks from the beach. There are 5 bars walking distance. They are open and packed. Most people outside aren't wearing masks. Everything's great.</p>
<p>Why am I posting this then? Because in October 2020 I was disabled by medical malpractice. I am a 31 year old man who enjoyed perfect health 6 months ago. Now I have to watch my steps every day as I only get a certain amount before I'm bed bound for 2-3 days. Today I got 2,200 painful steps in. A normal day was 6-10,000 pain free steps last fall. </p>
<p>I was poisoned by a pharmaceutical that does major damage to connective tissue and the nervous system. It may or may not be permanent, many people climb back to health but it takes a long time, usually 1-2 years. I'm at 5 months.</p>
<p>So sadly I am living in the middle of the Old Normal but can't enjoy it, because the same people who want to give me this vaccine crippled me with another one of their mad scientist concoctions.</p>
<p>We have our own subreddit, and the attitude there is very pro lockdown, pro mask, and get your vaccine (which is outright Stockholm Syndrome). Very lonely.</p></p>

        <p>I do hope that every day brings you healing. Five months is definitely not long enough to heal damage like that. I know it's not the same thing, but I had a running injury many years ago and it took me a very long time to heal. I haven't run since, but I stay fit in other ways. Just have to be careful with my knees, just in case. I feel like most of the regular pain was gone within five years and almost twenty years later I only notice some achy pain when the barometric pressure is up. The FL panhandle weather made it worse and I'm in NY now and hardly notice it. I'm still going back to the Gulf as soon as I can. I have no idea if it would help, but using icy/hot and heat pads brought me a ton of relief.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I'm not getting worse, I might even say getting better slowly. I do not know if I'll ever be 100% of the man I was before. I'm setting aggressive goals though. I want to get back to 90% of what I was before, and would like to accomplish that in a year. As a Plan B, I'd take 80% in 2 years. Even that would allow me to live a pretty normal life.</p>

        <p>I got progressively better and better. It was hard because I was so young, but I still had to work on my feet so I wore knee braces for close to a year. I'd apply icy hot at work lol. Standing in place was more pain than walking. It was pretty devastating, but I'd say within two years I was a hell of a lot better. I think I was close to full range of motion by then and able to get up from a squat. It's like it never happened now. I haven't thought about that injury in a long time;)</p>

        <p>I’ve had a similar experience with a well known antibiotic. It took me ages to feel normal again. I don’t trust any pills anymore it’s really scary thinking I could get ill and have to go through that again. I got entirely dismissed aswell and told it was ‘anxiety.’</p>

        <p>All too often for UTI's, prostatitis, epididymitis, etc. Despite the FDA's warning that it is a last resort for life threatening infections only. The doctors do not listen and then blame the patient when we come back and basically say I told you so.</p>
<p>While my reaction is not the case for the majority of the people, it's more common than people think as the doctors suppress the true number by misdiagnosing and failing to report to the FDA. They claim its 1 in 100,000 but when you factor in the number of fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, or RA cases are actually from the antibiotic, but are not linked, it may be closer to 1 in 10 or 1 in 25.</p>
<p>Big Pharma is poisoning us and then having their henchman doctors blame it on "autoimmune" disorders, passing the buck back onto our genetics. That's why I won't be taking their vaccine. I'll take a 9 mm first.</p>

        <p>I just fell into a time vacuum researching this for the last couple hours. I have had chronic fatigue since childhood, “unexplained” tendon/ligament/muscle/nerve pain, and fibromyalgia; so I am no stranger to the hell hole that is our “modern” throw drugs at you to make you go away sick-care system (unless you actually want the drugs, then they treat you like a criminal). Add on top of that that almost every effective therapy I had found that actually worked and had been oh-so-slowly making my health and my life better... is now considered “non-essential” by the fucktards with no clue how utterly essential it is to my well-being. 😩 </p>
<p>Sounds like you have had a rough go of it of late. We should talk sometime.</p>

        <p>I have celiac and hashimotos disease. I cannot take any pill that has gluten in it. The FDA makes it ok for drug companies to change their formulations of medicines at will. </p>
<p>I was near coma level thyroid function and doing all of my own research when I paid out of pocket to go to my Dr. (the one not covered by my shit insurance). The thyroid pills all had gluten in them in the form of salt starch glycolate or in the pressing of the pills.</p>
<p>I took a freezer bag full of pills that made me react. generics, name brands etc. Smart Dr. prescribed a compounding pharmacy that makes drugs from scratch for allergic people.
I got better and lost several years of my life in the process.</p>
<p>Smart Dr. also tested me for other allergies. Turns out I cannot eat chicken eggs. Smart Dr. told me that because of egg protein in the flu shots that tons of people are becoming allergic. </p>
<p>Long story short, I suggest you look into any meds you are taking. Call the companies themselves and if they say “I cannot confirm or deny” that the thing you react to is in the drug.</p>
<p>I still take my giant pill bag to new Dr. appointments along with packets of research articles. My insurance will not even cover the compounding pharmacy, so out of pocket it is. </p>
<p>At least my brain works again.</p>
<p>Good lick to you.</p>
