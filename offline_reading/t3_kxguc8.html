<title>Norway links 13 deaths among the elderly to side effects of the covid-19 vaccine. What's amazing is that they now don't recommend the elderly get vaccinated lest it kills them: the people it's meant to protect. But THESE elderly were on deaths door anyways apparently.

        <p>Side note: This is the first time in 11 months I'm hearing the words "elderly", "frail", and "extremely rare cases" being used as an explanation for anything.</p>

        <p>Good point.  You could probably do some sort of news story analysis and find that these words were barely used since March until now.  </p>
<p>Would be neat to see a graph</p>

        <p>Translation of article:</p>
<p>The Norwegian Medicines Agency links 13 deaths among the elderly and sick to side effects of the covid-19 vaccine. </p>
<p>The authorities have looked more closely at 13 deaths following vaccination</p>
<p>News: The Norwegian Medicines Agency has assessed 13 deaths that may have been related to the coronary vaccine. Common to those who died is that they were old and frail.</p>
<p>More than 25,000 Norwegians have been vaccinated with the first dose of the coronary vaccine from Pfizer and Biontech since Christmas. On Friday, the first dose of the new Moderna vaccine will be given.</p>
<p>So far, the Norwegian Medicines Agency has assessed 29 adverse reaction reports after the covid-19 vaccination. 13 of these had a fatal outcome, shows a new report from the Norwegian Medicines Agency.</p>
<p>Changes vaccine advice</p>
<p>All the deaths have occurred in frail, old patients in nursing homes. All are over 80 years old and some of them over 90, according to NRK.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reports may indicate that common side effects from mRNA vaccines, such as fever and nausea, may have led to deaths in some frail patients, says chief physician Sigurd Hortemo in the Norwegian Medicines Agency.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, both the National Institute of Public Health and the Norwegian Medicines Agency have changed the coronary vaccination guide with new advice for this group.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are very frail, you should probably not be vaccinated, said subject director Steinar Madsen in the Norwegian Medicines Agency at a webinar on coronary vaccine for journalists on Thursday.</li>
</ul>
<p>He emphasizes over NRK that these cases are rare, and that many thousands of frail people have been vaccinated without a fatal outcome.</p>
<p>This is in line with the recommendations that came from FHI earlier this week.</p>
<p>Different symptoms</p>
<p>As of 14 January, a total of 29 adverse reaction reports have been assessed after covid-19 vaccination. Of these, 21 are women and eight are men.
14 of these were in the age group 80â€“89 years, and seven were over 90 years old. Four were aged 70-79 years and four were aged 18-69 years.</p>
<p>13 of the reported reports had a fatal outcome, 9 had serious side effects and 7 are described as not serious side effects.</p>
<p>The most commonly reported side effects are general symptoms, such as decreased general fever and general malaise, and injection site reactions. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and respiratory symptoms such as wheezing and coughing are also among the most commonly reported side effects.</p>
<p>This is the first report on side effects from the Norwegian Medicines Agency, which will in future come with weekly side effect reports.</p>

        <p>This will be used to push the same narrative that they use for other vaccines, which is that healthy young people like you and I will <em>need</em> to be vaccinated to protect the people who can't vaccinate.</p>
