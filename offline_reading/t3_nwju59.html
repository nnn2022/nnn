        <p>Jesus Christ. Hardly anyone here thinks like that and these jabs do not look like the work of the devil, at least at the moment. </p>
<p>The main points of concern are around:</p>
<ol>
<li>We don’t need it, this is not the measles it has a very low death rate for people without pre-existing illness. Why take the risk and why rush into this just to get a shitty holiday in right now?</li>
<li>The lies being told throughout the whole pandemic are of a major concern for a lot of people. You are not being told the truth about test results, deaths etc and some of the decisions on how to handle this information such as reporting them within 28 days of a positive test is beyond absurd and means you can claim vaccine deaths as covid. </li>
<li>Why they are trying so hard to bribe people to take it when no government has ever wanted to “save lives” especially when it comes to old people, more people does not equate to more money for the country once you pass a certain age until you die and your pension is taxable. </li>
<li>They are refusing ANY liability for side effects, illness or death resulting from having this jab which would normally be a concern even if it wasn’t experimental.</li>

        <p>Over 3 million people have died of COVID, allegedly. That's a lot of people. Who is rushing? It took them a year to get a vaccine.</p>
<p>Of course there are lies. Everybody lies and pushes an agenda. People need to look critically at the information they receive. Maybe get info from several sources etc.</p>
<p>They want to save lives so they have their worker slaves to make them even richer.</p>
<p>Corporations are like that. What are the chances of dying of a vaccine against dying of a COVID?</p>

        <p>Starvation is not contagious, and does not really affect us in the Western World. It's weird how the news focuses on issues that affect us directly.</p>
<p>Are you really calling the majority of the planet lunatics? Of course the small group of uneducated fearful idiots are the only sane people here.</p>
<p>And I have questioned COVID. I found answers. Maybe that's just what they want me to think, though? Maybe the Illuminati have infiltrated society and leading the sheeple to their demise with their forced vaccines so they can control us and turn us into sex slaves. I haven't seen any evidence that it's not true, so it must be literally happening right now!</p>

        <p>A lot of the development time for vaccines is multiple phases of testing. If we have the whole world interested in getting vaccine (which we haven't ever really had before), of course this testing can be accelerated. They haven't worked out all the issues after 1 year, but they seem to have worked out enough for it to be safe enough to use.</p>
<p>Re the common cold, it's not a great comparison because there's not a great deal of motivation to cure that because it's so banal. </p>
<p>Maybe you should wait for the long term data on COVID too before you start taking any risks associated with that, like seeing other people or leaving the house. It's just strange to me how nobody seems to care about the long-term effects of a virus which has killed over 3 million people, but a few injections that have killed a handful are such cause for concern.</p>

        <p>Bullshit. Even the vaccine companies say their study end points are only to reduce risk of serious illness or hospitalization. Natural illness produce robust, long lasting immunity. People who got SARS in 2003 have antibodies that react to this virus while that virus is 20% different while variants are only 0.3% different at most. Exposure to whole virus enables bodies to produce several neutralizing antibodies whereas non neutralizing antibodies are produced with just spike protein. </p>
<p>This illness is not smallpox or the plague. Excess deaths are hardly a blip and average age at death from the kung flu is at or above life expectancy usually with 3 comorbidities. People dont wanna get it because it was rushed, it is experimental, the adverse reactions are way higher than a typical vaccine. Look it up. The long term effects are unknown. The govt propaganda and bribery is relentless. They are completely ignoring those who had covid and recovered and insist everyone get jabbed. Cleveland clinic says there is no benefit to take jab after recovery from covid. It seems it is all about the jab. And we have to deal with morons like you.</p>
<p>You can take pro vax propaganda and free donuts somewhere else alongwith your "patronizing prick" hat.</p>

        <p>I just asked some questions. I didn't realise you would be so easily triggered by someone questioning the stupid shit you believe.</p>
<p>It took a year to get these vaccines. How long should it take to develop a vaccine? </p>
<p>You're right we don't know the long term effects. We don't know the long-term effects of COVID either. And if you can dismiss the lethality of COVID so easily, surely you can do the same for the vaccines? What's caused more harm, COVID or the vaccine against COVID?</p>
<p>I think maybe it doesn't make sense to vaccinate those who have already had COVID. Nobody really knows though and there is a lot of misinformation out there coming from all parties, because this is a complex and new issue.</p>
<p>It's hard not to sound patronising when dealing with those less intellectually fortunate that myself.</p>

        <p>Hey bud. Lots of humans may not be very knowledgeable in lots of areas, they may not be clever or even half as smart as you, but a high percentage of people do have a very sensitive bullshit detector. This has been selected by evolution as we had to make life or death decisions based on limited information. Sure you can confuse and bamboozle people, but a large number of people feel this whole pandemic narrative stinks. Something is rotten in Denmark. People know they are being lied to about every aspect of it. From its origins, to masks, asymptomatic spread, the media censorship, suppression of effective treatments. All roads seem to lead to vaccines. The vaccine was rushed. Period. Efficacy rates are misleading. Using relative risk vs absolute risk. Adverse reactions are down played. For example, they say serious reactions are only 5 in 100000. That seems low, but when you understand that for a typical older vaccine it is 0.5 in 100000. That is 10 times higher. Just look at Moderna trial data. Far more adverse events in the vaccine group than placebo. This is only short term effects. We dont know long term. 
We dont need your BS and you are not saying anything the mainstream has not been shoving down our throats for so long and your attempt to debate or talk some sense into us is insulting. Go back to your safe space. Mods here are so forgiving unlike the nazis who control the subs that are frequented by your ilk.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of lies and misinformation and that's true. It doesn't mean it's all lies and misinformation. The vaccine was rushed, relatively, and that's why the risk is 10 times higher than other vaccines. The risk is still lower than the mortality rate of COVID, which is already very low according to a lot of people on here. All roads do lead to vaccines; that is how the fight against disease works.</p>
<p>As an aside, what effective treatments are the media suppressing?</p>
<p>I don't like my safe spaces because I like to challenge my beliefs. I like to hear things from the other perspective. I like to make fun of people while knowing I have the full weight of society and the scientific community on my side. I'm not afraid to come into the fool's den and kick the idiot hornet's nest in the pursuit of truth. I know I'm not going to convince anyone here, because why would you listen to me when you don't listen to experts, but I just wanted to hear the latest bullshit from this community of freethinkers at the forefront of science to see if maybe you had any evidence or good points or even reasonable assumptions. All signs point to no.</p>

        <p>Science is a progress, we often end up finding out things we considered healthy are actually bad (tobacco for example). There are lot of reasons for why science "fails" greatly at times.</p>
<p>I know you cant believe that this is currently happening and Im not willing to write an essay on all the many, many, many reasons why I believe what I believe. Im just very much concerned that we basically treat each other as if it was the dark ages and we need to burn people on the stake for coming to different conclusions.</p>

        <p>Fwiw, Im not scared of the Vax and I do hope it wont end up having any serious side-effects (obv. side-effects will always occur with medicin, but hopefully not more than usual).</p>
<p>Im heavily worried about the plans our "leaders" and those of the people our "leaders" listen to. Especially since they treated this crisis as a chance from day1 onwards to work towards their plans and how seemingly the majority doesnt even care about or is completely unaware.</p>

        <p>People are exploiting this virus as much as they can - that is unfortunately the state of the World and always will be whenever there is a catastrophe. I believe that pretty much everybody is corrupt, but only some of us have power.</p>
<p>The thing with vaccines though is that there is a general scientific consensus they are good. Just because the corrupt politicians agree with this, I don't think it invalidates the opinions of the scientists (who have less power and are less corrupt, I believe). I just don't think the corruption goes that deep. </p>
<p>Maybe it's naïve of me, but to me it seems it's in the best interests of the governments of the World to have us all safely vaccinated so things can return to normal. I don't think they are putting chips in us or compliance drugs.</p>
<p>The thing with corruption is that every individual is a different source of said corruption, normally for the purpose of increasing individual wealth and power. I don't think our leaders are sitting together at the Illuminati headquarters plotting together to destroy society as we know it. Something similar probably does happen but on a much smaller scale. This World is made up of a bunch of individuals and small groups of buddies each looking out their themselves and trying to fuck over everyone else. If you look at how the world's richest have increased their wealth since COVID first hit our streets, maybe it's possible they are behind this wave of antivax propaganda. Maybe getting this vaccine is a way to stick it to that bald Amazon man and tell him that he can't profit of our deaths any longer.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, maybe COVID is fake and also the vaccine is fake and all the governments are working together with scientists across the globe to lie to us for some unknown purpose, but that seems like it would be a logistical nightmare.</p>

<p>See, thats exactly it. Im not talking about Illumati or anything of that kind. But, thats the wierd thing, somehow the people are quick to come up with this stuff and dismiss factual reality.</p>
<p>Read for example: Covid 19: The great Reset by Klaus Schwab</p>
<p>("People will own nothing and be happy about it")</p>
<p>("Modern Politicis wont have much need for votes, because the algorythm will already know your position on the matter based on your data")</p>
<p>Or Check the WEF Website, especially the The Great Reset. Or their young global leaders club....</p>
<p>Im not talking about any Conspiracy, Im talking about the very thoughts &amp; plans our Elites openly discuss. I disagree with their Philosophies and Ideas. But, most people dismiss that something like the World Economic Forum, even has influence on the politics, which is literally insane. Most of the top-politicians of our world, like Trudeau, Macron, Baerbock... have been directly educated by the WEF.</p>
<p>Ever heard of Bilderberger? Again Im not talking about a satanic cult, Im talking about many of the worlds most influencial people meet together to discuss topics such as "Weaponisation of Social Media" behind closed doors.</p>
<p>This is not a Democracy but an Oligarchy and its very bothering that most people are completely unaware that these structures even exist, or they deny their influence which is way, way, way more crazy than believing in a demonic cult if you ask me.</p>

        <p>Well, its kinda strange how everything comes together.</p>
<p>Like, there is this Rockefeller paper from 2010 detailing four different scenarios on how modern society can be reshaped. One scenario (Lockstep) is currently happening. The idea is that admits a Pandemic the Government finally becomes the power to restructure the economy and other things.</p>
<p>Programs such as ID2020 or CBDC are in a phase to go live soon. And oh, surprise, surprise just now we have a solid reason to implement mandatory digital IDs. Which people have been very skeptical about before, but now are happy to use.</p>
<p>There is this Pandemic Prepardness Event 201, just in November 2019, where they plan how a deadly Coronavirus Pandemic would play out. But, they hardly talk about medical things, instead they talk about stuff such as how there will be big businesses that will be considered essential, where as small business willl be considered non-essential, the monetary programs implement by governments will reflect on that fact.</p>
<p>Then Covid actually comes 4 Months later, another Month later the WEF starts their Great Reset campaign...</p>
<p>This is just a glimpse, there is much more comming together just exactly when the pandemic hits.</p>
<p>Its kinda wierd how for the small guys like me, I am told to sit at home and be a hero watching Netflix. While the big guys are to restructure society in the meantime.</p>
<p>Surely the Great Reset sounds great. But, who are you listening to? There is no collective group that has done greater harm to nature (and climate change) than the WEF group. Those are the companies that destroy the rain-forrest, exploit cheap labour and worse. They are majorily responsible for many grievances that we witness today. Why would you believe they are also the ones, changing it to a better state?</p>
<p>Quite frankly, when I read their stuff I envision Elysium. And again, the major issue is: Basically no one talks about it.</p>

        <p>A lot of things are strange but I'm still not really seeing anything that suggests this virus was planned.</p>
<p>Pandemics are not a new thing. H1N1, for example, was prevalent around the time the Lockstep document was written and was certainly on people's minds. The flu pandemic of 1918 was one of the greatest losses of human life and so a lot of people have been trying to make sure that doesn't happen again. Scientists and experts hold a lot of events and write a lot of papers about possible scenarios because it is a massive ongoing issue. This has been an issue even going back to the Black Death, and you can't blame the WEF for that one!</p>
<p>I had a quick read about that Lockstep - <a href="http://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf">http://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf</a> (a second-hand source but I am willing to accept it's genuine). Essentially it's one of four creative writing exercises in which the author imagines how the world would change in response to various world events. If there are any parallels between the story depicted in Lockstep and real life, it's because the writer has done their research and government response to a pandemic is known to some extent, because governments have prepared for this. I would also like to point out that the government (all of them) already have the power to restructure the economy and society because they are in charge.</p>
<p>Prepardness Event 201 does seem like a strange coincidence coming so soon before the start of the pandemic, but I can't see it being anything other a coincidence. As I said, there are a lot of these events, and if you were going to release a deadly virus upon the world, why would you also host a preparedness event a couple of months before? What purpose would it serve? For reference, you can see their comment on the coincidence here: <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/news/center-news/2020/2020-01-24-Statement-of-Clarification-Event201.html">https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/news/center-news/2020/2020-01-24-Statement-of-Clarification-Event201.html</a></p>
<p>In terms of IDs, I can't see what's going live soon and I'm also not too sure if public opinion has changed on them. I had a quick Google so if you have some sources for me to investigate, that would help.</p>
<p>Finally, the World Economic Forum. In the middle of a pandemic which changed the economy of the World, they decided to theme their forum around the pandemic and the future after the pandemic. This does not seem unusual or suspicious and seems like the obvious topic to choose. I don't believe the WEF is unilaterally some evil organisation like the Illuminati responsible for all the world's problems. I believe it's a bunch of rich people virtue signalling while they individually commit all that climate change and exploitation of cheap labour etc. that you talk about. I don't think anything will come of the Great Reset because I don't believe the WEF has any more power than its individual members. I am sure that within the WEF and other similar organisations, there are groups of world leaders and rich people working together to fuck over guys like you and me, but I don't think they have a website.</p>
<p>If we went to see a great reset in this World, we will need to be the ones to bring it about through revolution. Nobody is talking about the WEF stuff because it's not true, at least not in the way you seem to think it's happening, but issues like deforestation, climate change and income equality are happening and they are being talked about and nothing is happening to fix them. That's the real problem.</p>

        <p>They clearly carry more short term risks than previous non gene therapy vaccines as evidenced by VAERs and the yellow card system. Even if there were zero adverse events associated with them I still wouldn't take it as they have never proven that's "Sars-Cov-2" exists.</p>
<p>This is how they discovered "SARS-COV-2" by assembling RNA fragments from samples with multiple sources of genetic material using an algorithm.</p>
<p>&rt;RNA extracted from <strong>bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid</strong> and <strong>culture supernatants</strong> was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. Sequence reads were <strong>assembled</strong> into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) <strong>with the use of CLC Genomics software</strong>, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed.</p>

        <p>I think there is more risk with this vaccine than others. Still probably less risk than COVID though.</p>
<p>I tried to read through the article but the details were a little beyond me. I think I understand your extract and I think it's amazing what they can do with technology. That may be how it was initially discovered, but here is an electron microscope image of some of the virus: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Novel_Coronavirus_SARS-CoV-2.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Novel_Coronavirus_SARS-CoV-2.jpg</a> You wouldn't think these cute little guys could be responsible for so many deaths.</p>

        <p>Look at it from my perspective. I have the NIAID (a group of scientists) showing lots of electrographs showing what they claim is coronavirus, the characteristics of which fit with the global scientific consensus of what a coronavirus looks like. Link here: (https://www.flickr.com/photos/niaid/albums/72157712914621487/page1)</p>
<p>On the other side, there is you telling me it's not true and they need to prove it, while offering no evidence. Why do you believe their evidence (the images) are fake? Also, why do you trust the initial link you showed me from China and think that it proves COVID is not real, but you don't trust the images I showed or any of the other scientists who say COVID is real?</p>
<p>Help me out here because if you have evidence that every government of the World is lying to us, I want to know about it.</p>

<p>Appeal to authority and argumentum ad populum. The burden of proof is on those alleging a novel "organism". They have not nearly satisfied that burden.</p>

        <p>Can you stop being a fucking idiot for one day in your life and just think about what you saying?</p>
<p>They have captured images of it. This is proof. The burden of proof is now on you to explain why these images are not evidence.</p>
<p>Some Chinese scientists assembled it's RNA from multiple samples. This is proof. The burden of proof is on you to explain why you think their methodology was flawed. You have misunderstood the article if you think this shows SARS-COV-2 is not real.</p>
<p>There were also more deaths than normal for a period: https://www.ons.gov.uk/resource?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales/september2020/0b26370e.png (UK data). This is proof. If it wasn't coronavirus, what caused this peak?</p>
<p>They have satisfied the burden of proof at every step. But because you are so fixated on the idea that this virus doesn't exist, you ignore the truth. Just because you don't understand something or can't see it, it doesn't mean it's not real.</p>
<p>Basically you're saying we can't trust experts or the general consensus. While this is true to an extent, surely you can agree it is better to trust the larger, more diverse group of people that are less likely to all have a common nefarious aim than it is to trust a small bunch of uneducated fools on some forums.</p>
<p>Likewise, I don't know for sure it's real; maybe those American scientists and Chinese scientists and UK government are working together to trick us along with the other thousands of sources that suggest this is real, but we would have to assume a global network that has infiltrated the whole world but is entirely secret. If 99% of people say something is real, the 1% need to have some really good proof. Just claiming that all the evidence is fake is meaningless.</p>
<p>And I am sorry for calling you a fucking idiot, but it is entirely justified and I want you to know it. It's good to be skeptical, but when you don't use your intelligence to think about the bigger picture, you end up believing all sorts of stupid and dangerous shit.</p>

<p>All the scientists are using that Chinese paper as the basis of their own work. They are all using basically the same techniques. No researcher in history has ever actually truly isolated a virus and subsequently sequenced genetic material that has it as the only possible source.</p>

<p>The vaccines have all been proven to be incredibly safe.</p>
<p>The only reason not to take it is because you don't like being told what to do.</p>
<p>All the other arguments don't stack up.</p>
<ul>
<li>"I don't need it, I've had Covid" - all medical experts say you do.</li>
<li>"my risk of Covid problems is low, I don't need it" - all medical experts say you do. Plus, society as a whole needs you to. It will cause you no problems having it, it'll protect those around you and it'll ease restrictions quicker.</li>
<li>"it's experimental, I don't trust it" - no one cares. Millions and millions of people have had it with zero problems. The technology is decades old. The research into coronavirus are 50+ years old. There are zero reasons to mistrust it.</li>
</ul>
