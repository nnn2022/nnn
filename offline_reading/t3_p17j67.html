    <strong>Bill Gates…the only reason anyone tolerates him…</strong>
    <p><p>is because he has so much money he throws around. Would anyone put up with him but for all that money? Don’t you think Fauci rolls his eyes every time he calls? He has no business weighing in on most things the media interviews him about. Computers that suck…yes. But vaccines….no, coronavirus…no. Even his wife is sick of him. Ex wife. He makes me barf. Rant over.</p></p>

        <p>Americans have an obsession with celebrities. For whatever reason, if someone's on TV, plays sports, or has wealth, people blindly listen to their opinion on topics they're not qualified to talk about. </p>
<p>Is Bill Gates a smart man, yeah, of course. Is he someone who should be making humanitarian or political decisions? Probably not. </p>
<p>He's someone who has impaired empathy. He sees humans as objects. As most super wealthy people do. Mark Zuckerberg is another one.</p>
<p>It's not their wealth that makes them this way. They were already that way, but they've moved up into an influential position.</p>

        <p>Maybe Bill Gates is planning on using the vaccine to reprogram human DNA lol. Since he knows computer coding, why not gene coding? Turn everyone into little compliant cyborgs. I don't see why else anyone would listen to him in the medical and science fields, besides money like you said.</p>

        <p>To be fair, his computers don’t suck. I’m actually a big fan of his products. But then, there’s the problem. It’s not like he stole his money from anyone. He made a product which was so good that people were willing to overlook his flaws to purchase them, by the millions. </p>
<p>Same with Jeff Bezos. People love to complain about him, but guess what? Most of us voluntarily support him because his service is better than anything else on the market. </p>
<p>We then complain about how these billionaires are funding things we are opposed to, forgetting the fact that we collectively gave them the money do so in the first place.</p>
