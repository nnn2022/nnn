    <strong>People getting sicker who were vaxxed?</strong>
    <p><p>I wonder if there are already subtle effects happening in the vaxx beyond the earlier extreme side effects or even deaths. I know some people who have gotten usual out of the blue illnesses, even young people only a couple months after the vaxx. What worries me is they designed this all for a wide variety of effects, maybe where ever the spike proteins/nanoparticles "settle" in the body so no one will connected it to the vaxx. Maybe there's multiple layers, THAT and then variant ADE stuff to come. Are you noticing the vaxxed are getting more illnesses yet, like colds, flus or other new illnesses?</p></p>

        <p>This is an actual conspiracy theory although more of a grim prediction, however my guess is that most governments will cover up deaths from the jab, which if all works well people will start dropping dead at the beginning of flu season, look at case counts from the beginning of flu season last year, it would be consistent with case counts from last year, although I imagine everyone here knows the amount of false positives from the garbage PCR test. They will blame it on "super variants", "double variants" or whatever they come up with to send a shiver down the sheep's spines to cover up the increasing death toll from "Covid". that's my guess from seeing how this has gone so far, and it's a worst case scenario. Best case scenario, at least from my Canadian perspective would be more lockdowns starting in the fall, going on until spring then summer is somewhat normal, until the people have been fully conditioned to listen without thinking.</p>

        <p>I agree with everything you wrote. And here in Ontario, it's full of god damned brainwashed fools. Our future looks grim. There is a sinister force at work here, and evil can only win when people do nothing about it.</p>

        <p>I noticed it twice now. Perfectly healthy young guys got vaxxed. Both god sick at the same time and nobody else in the office did (all unvaxxed). They got REALLY sick too to the point they had to take time off. Really odd and out of nowhere</p>

        <p>I have the idea it's doing something to the blood specifically. Someone I know took the vax and had a routine blood check 3 weeks later. Some parameters (iron, hemoglobin) were so bad he had to go straight to the hospital where he got a blood transfusion. Ever since, this person seems to be anemic.<br>
Someone else I know takes care of eldery people. She says she's seeing so many of them with big bruises after taking the shot, it's disturbing.<br>
Combined with all the other side effects I'm seeing here on reddit, message boards and social media, I'm quite confident one of the biggest problems will be the blood. There's blood clots, disappearing platelets, the strange menstrual issues which could be blood related, other people also reporting anemia and bruising, etc.</p>

        <p>I think it's doing stuff to the blood too. Probably spike proteins are adhering to blood cells. I am already anemic, one more reason to refuse the vaxx. I think the seizures, etc and other problems are circulatory system related. Strokes, heart attacks etc, definitely are.</p>
