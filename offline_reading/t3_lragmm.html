<p>To paraphrase, you think the lockdown will end when everyone complies and its finally safe. That sounds great but is completely detached from reality. "Until its safe" means never</p>

If you're optimistic you'll sit tight while all of your basic human rights are stripped.</p>

        <p>I know there seems to be this 'us vs them' thing happening now but the unfortunate truth is that you will not get your freedom back until enough of us wake up, get together and take it back.</p>
<p>Numbers don't lie, the deaths from all causes 2020 are all basically average. The pandemic only exists in the media and its 24/7 reminders of it. In fact there is no let up from it, everywhere you go and everything you do now you will hear about the pandemic.
If you need to keep being reminded that there's a pandemic happening, well it's probably not a pandemic.</p>
<p>I don't care if you listen to me or not. I've arrived at a point today where I'm about to give up on everything. I have been trying to wake people up since March last year, and I've been ignored while all my predictions have come true.</p>
<p>You will not be given your freedom back from a group of people who got where they are by lying to the public. You can stay optimistic if you wish but that's just lying down and taking it. Power is in numbers. If you do wake up, please spread the word.</p>

        <p>I am listening, i'm not here to just argue, i do want to understand where you are coming from. i would love it if you were right and its just a conspiracy and theres no such thing as the corona virus and people aren't dying but you can't just ignore the fact that over 120,000 people have died here in the UK alone. The pandemic doesn't just exist in the media, it's the biggest thing to happen in our life time so of course its going to be in the media, id be more worried if it wasn't on the news.</p>
<p>What do you mean by our freedom wont be given back because surely its not in the governments interest to continue lockdown as it is drastically affecting out economy and our lives in general, what would be the benefit?</p>

        <p>I'm not denying covid exists, even though the more I look into it, it just seems they renamed influenza and scared everyone.</p>
<p>But the PCR tests aren't being used properly, they create lots of false positives. The numbers of deaths are not accurate because anyone who's tested positive within 28 days of dying is a covid death. None of the deaths after vaccination are being called covid deaths. The vaccine is approved for emergency use only and is experimental, phase 3 of testing is what they're doing now giving it to the public. Asymptomatic spread is not happening and the scientific consensus on masks stopping the spread for decades before 2020 is that they don't work. If they did, why would we not have used them for influenza?
You're told listen to the experts but many doctors and scientists have lost their job, lost their public voice and more over speaking out against this new science. In fact there's so much censorship that anything other than the tv science is removed for "misinformation". Flu deaths are gone, flu cases are gone, and covid cases are constantly up? </p>
<p>None of the above  is conspiracy theory shit, it is all proven and true at this point..meaning the entire last year of this "pandemic" is not at all accurate. Even if we are to believe the numbers, the stats show that this is not a high risk for most people. But it's actually less deadly because we are being lied to. The mainstream media have nothing to say about any of it.</p>
<p>Now, a government always lies to the people, everyone knows this. I am supposed to believe the government now? Despite censoring actual professionals because they are saying the opposite to them?</p>
<p>You will not get your freedom back because it is clearly not about health. It is not a pandemic. I am in the worst country for restrictions in europe and we are still banging away doing the same lockdown shit but getting nowhere. The only effect are the killing off of the working class. People are out of work, depressed, suicidal and without hope. There are plenty of things that kill more every year, some even more contagious than this and we don't go mad.</p>
<p>Either all governments are totally braindead or there is an agenda and they're pushing it. I know they're liars but I don't think they're completely braindead.</p>
<p>What the actual plan is, I don't know for sure, but this "great reset" is a large part. There was some publication for the world economic forum by the rockefeller foundation about the future of life with improving technology. They include a chapter about "lockstep" where they detail presenting a pandemic to the public, and constantly increasing restrictions and lockdowns and totalitarian rule in the name of public safety. The expiration date for this lockstep project is March 2025.</p>
<p>I don't know what the plan exactly is, but what I do know is that our rights are being taken every day now. It's been a year and people are brainwashed beyond all reason. Afraid of their fellow man. I know that waiting to find out what the plan is will be too late to stop it.</p>

        <p>The reason we have to wear masks is because covid is a lot more infectious then the normal common flu, and there is a new vaccine pretty much each year to protect people and to slow down the rate of transmission. When people are vaccinated for covid then masks will be no longer necessary. And haven't you thought that the reason flu rates have gone down is because people have been isolating the past year, which just proves it works. I haven't had a cold since Feb last year so that just shows that quarantine stop the spread of a virus. 
The fact that people are losing their jobs and mental health issues have become a crisis isn't the fault of people following the rules, its the fault of the governments for not giving financial support, job security or any support in general. And yes, there are a lot of things that cause more deaths each year but we try to prevent them as much as possible, thats why hospitals exist. The reason that the world has gone mad about this is because its new and no one was expecting or prepared for a pandemic. </p>
<p>But i just don't think calling people braindead for believing in the pandemic is fair, theres a lot more evidence that it exists then evidence that its a conspiracy. When has there ever been a time where all the governments across the globe have agreed on anything? Brexit has been ongoing for the past 6 years with no agreement so i think its extremely unlikely that all leaders have agreed to create a fake pandemic to scare us all and lock us away in our homes for a year without it being challenged or fought against.</p>
<p>Our rights are not being taken away, yes its annoying being home all day and you cant go to a bar or shop but its for the greater good. No one enjoys a lockdown but we know its necessary to saves lives. Id much rather stay indoors for a year and have fewer deaths then just pretend it doesn't exist and kill half the population</p>

<p>How is the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 related to mask wearing? Mask wearing (by your logic) is to prevent the TRANSMISSION of the pathogen by reducing airborne droplets. The reason for using masks is to reduce airborne droplets and not infectiousness. </p>
<p>The reason that influenza cases globally have imploded by anywhere from 95-99% is because social distancing, masks and handwashing have been supposedly working. The only way that C19 could still be increasing is because masks do NOT work and/or social distancing does NOT work and/or handwashing does NOT work. Which is it?</p>

        <p>the incubation period is a lot longer than the flu so people are spreading covid when they are showing no symptoms, the transmission rate is higher than the flu and there are flu vaccines each year to slow the spread. the covid vaccine has only just started being rolled out and there is already evidence that it is working. </p>

        <p>Again, you're not applying critical thinking. To be honest, you're just talking like someone who gets all his opinions from watching the news and doesn't do independent research.</p>
<p>Masks have nothing to do with viral incubation periods. If masks work and are indeed stopping airborne droplets, then the incubation period only becomes a factor once someone is infected (which can't happen because masks help, according to your hypothesis).</p>
<p>What exactly do you mean by "transmission rate is higher than the flu?" C19 vaccines were not designed to prevent infection and transmission which is why you are still expected to wear masks, engage in social distancing and keep scrubbing those hands with alcohol. Surely you are aware that the C19 test criteria was changed by the WHO hours after Biden was sworn in and that a clinical C19 case is now described at lower PCR cycle thresholds AND confirmation of symptoms?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;also lockdowns are working, two weeks after lockdowns have been announced the cases decline.</p>
<p>I'm in Europe and we had far stricter lockdowns than those in the US. Lockdowns did NOT work and we've had successive waves of C19 infections.</p>

<p>&rt;and yes i do get my information from the news and i also search it for my self and i make my own opinion; but i don‚Äôt just disregard everything the news tells me and say i‚Äôm being brainwashed by the media. surely you get your info from online sources so how is that any different? your ‚Äòindependent‚Äô research was still written by someone else</p>
<p>There's a difference between MSM talking points and vigorously checked peer-reviewed scientific articles. You've been shown plenty on this sub but want to double down on what the MSM TV doctors say. You're obviously entitled to do so, but random online sources do not constitute 'independent research.'</p>
