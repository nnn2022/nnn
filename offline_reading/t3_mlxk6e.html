        <p>In the Netherlands the church is the only place without any restrictions, now lately there has been a shitload of news propaganda; trying to turn the majority of NL citizens against church gatherings.</p>
<p>With annoying journalist harassing the religious; one got kicked in the stomach that was pretty hilarious imo. Spreading news like everyone in the church has covid and is infecting everyone. </p>
<p>Then trying to act on the psychological side of the sheeple again, by interviewing people with questions like "what do you think about that the church is still open?" and of course they only show people saying "its terrible, close it down". Because they want those mass conformist little sheep minds to work with them. Pathetic, but it always works.</p>

        <p>This is disturbing from a religious perspective. Regardless of your views on the mandates in your area, religious leaders have a responsibility to their community, as well as how their community is perceived by the outside. I can't fathom the justification for a preacher to call ordinary police nazi's for enforcing a law which they are clearly breaking. The police don't need a warrant when you are openly breaking the law. If you don't agree with the law, there are many ways to protest and engage in civil disobedience without losing all integrity and credibility by acting like a mad man.</p>
