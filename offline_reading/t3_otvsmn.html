        <p>Because they know this will get a stronger reaction.</p>
<p>Because they want to scare the populace.</p>
<p>Because they want people to accept masks, lockdowns, mandatory vaccines, the health passports, et al. </p>
<p>They know they can frighten people into compliance, and it's working well for them, so they're pumping even more fearmongering into the public to get what they want.</p>

        <p>People like you/us are in the minority, as much as people here want to deny it. </p>
<p>Most people will react to emotions over their logic, and not just for Covid, but for everything in life.</p>
<p>Obviously, sometimes it's okay to listen to your heart over your head...but people seem to always care more about their fee-fees over logic.</p>

        <p>I feel like the outrageous way the “experts” report on all of this is just so bananas…I cannot believe people follow and trust it. </p>
<p>If I were just to follow what I saw online &amp; on TV…I’d be terrified and sheltering at home since March 2020. </p>
<p>I work with the public. I have an acrobatic studio &amp; two food trucks…and I live in an open state. I will admit, that after I work huge events, I come home and wonder (still), “omg, am I gonna get sick?” —but (knock on wood)….here I am. It kinda makes you step back and realize…”woah, if I have been exposed to hundreds of thousands of people…and I am ok….then something isn’t adding up here.”</p>
<p>I always try to make sense of it on my head…”well, I am only 40, I have no co-morbidities, so maybe I am just lucky?” —but, no. This virus may be real and devastating to some…but that percentage of people of people is so small that I am more likely to get struck by lightning</p>

<p>You can follow the internet and TV news, and it still doesn't make any sense. I dug up many articles back then. I saw the statistics for Italy and other countries, saw that the 80+ population was most affected along with how Italy has had many issues with illnesses and smog that prompt respiratory illnesses, and I knew this was all a sham. All of it. I've been saying this for months, at /r/conspiracy then at /r/lockdownskepticism then here, that the data was <strong>always</strong> there that proved this was a "nothingburger". And yet here we are. </p>

<p>I'm in the camp that believe Covid is the flu/colds repurposed and relabeled. The statistics also support this, including the "droves of excess deaths" claimed by the media and governments. If you look into the numbers (of which the flu "disappeared in 2020"), then you'll see that this is even more of a scam than once thought.</p>
