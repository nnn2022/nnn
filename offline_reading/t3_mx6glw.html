    <strong>If masks and social distancing are so effective. Than why didn‚Äôt it work in the 1920‚Äôs?</strong>
    <p><p>Estimated 100 million dead in the second wave after months and months of social distancing and masks. </p>
<p>Doomers argue this was because conservatives and the pro war effort tried to downplay the virus. </p>
<p>This has a familiar air to ‚ÄúTrump did it!‚Äù. Even though he wasn‚Äôt born yet.</p>
<p>I think if your plan requires 100% perfect conformity than maybe it‚Äôs a shitty plan that hinges on the fact that when it fails you can always claim that we didn‚Äôt do it good enough.  </p>
<p>Side note: </p>
<p>The second wave attacked young people disproportionately. Someone else‚Äôs life may have been literally chosen over yours if you are under 50. I go more into detail about the reverse selection caused by lockdowns here.</p>

        <p>I asked that same question months ago and my online sources have probably been edited by now so do your own due diligence but here‚Äôs the answer that I came up with. 
Back during the Spanish flu a new wonder drug was on the market. This new drug called Aspirin cured fever and inflammation and seemed to be perfect for this new flu. The problem was doctors really didn‚Äôt know much about aspirin and were prescribing it it what we now know to be lethal doses.</p>

        <p>They also hadn‚Äôt invented Tylenol yet. Which would have be exceptionally more effective. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve heard the aspirin thing. But no one mentions how everyone in the 20‚Äôs was using tons of heroine like 24/7.</p>

        <p>Who realistically even knew about that little niche piece of history before all the propagandists got their hands on it? No one, that's the answer no one, it was forgotten and fringe until recently, now they're trying to make it seem as if it was common and widly accepted back then, even though it wasn't.</p>
