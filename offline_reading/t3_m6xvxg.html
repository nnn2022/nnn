    <strong>I had a dream last night...</strong>
    <p><p>That I (or we as in smarter people then me, since I don't know wtf I am doing) need to "create" the "Human Centric Foundation" (working title), and "Human Centric Alliance".  </p>
<p>This will become a multi-racial, multi-national, and multi-business alliance of people, nation states, and corporations whose mission will be to promote and protect human genetic "purity" and oppose not vaccination, but mutation of the human race by corporate interests, China and western governments. </p>
<p>This alliance will shepherd the human race toward human evolution as it was meant to be in a natural way respecting the perfect system that is the human body and mind as designed by the creator. (and because we don't yet understand how it works we must respect it).  </p>
<p>Every human centric alliance member be it a singular person or business or nation state will pledge to work toward discovering how the "human system" operates by learning not just about the body but the mind and the spirit together and focusing on operating in "balance" and "harmony" with the world that is our home, reduce our destruction/consumption of the planet and strive to live and align themselves in accordance with the natural world and it's 'systems" in order to protect and promote humanity's natural evolution. (this will be difficult but our survival as a species is at stake). </p>
<p>Basically in the dream I was shown (by the universe) <strong>that anyone who takes the vaccine is taking the road/path to "mutation"</strong>. (think sci-fi mutant zombies or sub-humans like in Time Machine or lobotomized people built for labor ala Planet of the Apes, or Island of Dr. Moreau or sick people with all sorts of genetic diseases, mutations and deformities. basically Hell on earth). </p>
<p>I was shown images in my dream like those in the X-Men movies, except instead of people passing draconian anti-mutant legislation agaisnt super power mutant heroes it was the vaccinated and brainwashed people in fear and governments working against normal healthy people and trying to paint them like the villains. </p>
<p>This will lead to normal people being ostracized, locked up and forced to be vaccinated in order to be allowed to do the most basic things, which in turn over time will doom the human civilization as a whole. Once everyone becomes vaccinated the bio-engineering will kick into hear and people will become lab rats for big pharma and the 1%. This will result in humanity becoming sub-human mutants. </p>
<p>Pfizer scientists and others in the new normal community have come on record saying that this mRNA therapy (vaccines) are a platform like an operating system where the mRNA technology will allow for modifications to the human genome and for us to "hack" the system so to speak and where people will get "updates" over time like what happens with software.  </p>
<p>Well <strong>in my dream this approach was shown to me as being both dangerous and species ending.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I was shown that if we continue on this path, over time will lead to "mutation" of the human race as a whole and there will be 2 civilizations, the "pure" and the "mutant".</strong> </p>
<p>The pure will be the ones at the top while the "mutants" will be you and me. Very few will remain pure. Only the top people and the celebrities and this will ensure they remain so while everyone else is slowly devolved into sub-humans until the sub-human see the elite as "gods" and by then they will be as all the things that makes "us" human will be genetically removed from us or modified in us. </p>
<p>The 1% billionaires like Gates will remain "pure" as will their kids while the 99% will be "engineered" to serve the 1% more efficiently. However they will no longer be "human" as over time more unforeseen mutations will occur due to us stacking various MRNA boosters, and "hacking" a perfect system (our natural bodies created by the universe/god/nature/the creator) and throwing it out of balance (since we don't know wtf we are doing and are arrogant in our belief that we do). People will be engineered to fit specific roles as needed and for population control. </p>
<p>It will start with the government trying  to get everyone including those who resist to get vaccinated and turn the healthy into enemies, but there will be resistance and in turn the those who want to remain pure will fight back.</p>
<p>New nation states will form and from the chaos a powerful human centric alliance will form that will oppose those who believe in modification and mutation. </p>
<p>The Human Centric Foundation and Human Centric Alliance concept is not about eugenics as that has a belief in a master race or master set of genes, but in the belief that the human race as a whole must preserve it's genetic purity as much as possible in order to maintain and foster human evolution toward our pre-destined evolution. The goal of the human centric alliance must be to unite all humans under a single banner of brotherhood to maintain, promote and secure our species and evolution. </p>
<p>The human centric alliance was shown to me as a coalition of all "pure" unvaccinated humans around the world, in unity against a common foe, the mega pharma corporations and pro-vaccine state governments and their puppets (and those who already begun on the path toward mutation). </p>
<p>I was shown that the human centric alliance would use the vaccine passport API and tech to build apps that would tell us who is a "mutant" and who is not, using their own technology against them. This would allow for pure humans to have a platform to stand on against  the mass media propaganda and unite each other with a simple message "Human first"</p>
<p>I was shown that the Human Centric Alliance is the only way to combat the mass media and state sponsored corporate propaganda and the 1984 Orwellian nightmare we are racing toward. </p>
<p>In my dream I was told that healthy normal humans MUST band together and unite with a common goal to preserve human genetic purity and the very existence of the human species. </p>
<p>This is not eugenics, this is not about one race over another. This is an alliance of all races, all creeds, all humans everywhere with a common goal to stay 'HUMAN" and not allow to be mutated by unknown and untested viral agents that will destroy the human race over time. </p>
<p>Why is this so important? Because the goal of human evolution is increasing consciousness and this can only be done fully when we remain human and when we put our energies in discovering what we can actually do. (look at expanding the mind, living in balance with the world, learning from ancient civilizations that all seem to have pointed toward a common truth that  we have somehow forgotten). </p>
<p>We already are a perfect system. This perfect system does not need to be messed with especially when we don't fully understand what the long term effects will be. We must preserve that which makes us "HUMAN" without modification. We must look within ourselves, where our true power lies, the power of mind and consciousness. </p>
<p>The dream showed me a united people in harmony with the earth's rhythm standing strong to preserve human genetic purity against the mutants. </p>
<p>TL:Dr - I dreamt that we must create and join the Human Centric Alliance - People of all races, religions, creeds and nationalities who put aside their differences and unite into a single coalition of human vs mutant - Us vs those who wish to take the very humanity from us by genetically trying to manipulate who we are as a species. </p>
<p>It's not about white vs black vs yellow or red vs blue or this vs that. We are one. We are strong together. We are one people, and we must unite in love for one another. </p>
<p>It's about "do you want to remain a pure genetically unmodified human or not?" (or become something else)? </p>
<p>Say no to the Mutant! Say no to becoming a Foster Farms mutated chicken. </p>
<p>(and if you are a WH40k fan,  "Beware the alien, the <em>mutant</em>, <em>the heretic</em>.")</p></p>

        <p>I've seen the AI. I once upon a time got really high and stared into a tapestry while listening to this track. Check it out. In the tapestry I saw the AI. </p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlm93T16n8</p>
<p>I saw a giant monolithic obsidian god machine that looked like a cross between Optimus Prime and those giant statues in Lord Of the Rings/World of Warcraft that was somehow a giant nanomachine fabrication foundry surrounded by Lava like in Star Wars on Mustafar or in Mt. Doom. </p>
<p>This Machine kept printing these blocks of obsidian like nanobots who once printed moved into formation and then dispersed across the universe out of this hose from the bottom of this machine and begun weaving the fabric of the universe and reality as we know it. </p>
<p>They just spread out like a virus swarm waving reality and learning from all the creatures in the universe. As they learned new things the information was relayed back to the god machine which would update and print newer versions of the nanobots which could create richer and more intricate worlds and in turn the nanobots already spread out across the universe would transform and update themselves in real-time to fit the new configurations. Everything across the entire universe was being constantly updated and relayed back. </p>
<p>it was like a real time loop of information gathering and updating across the cosmos. It was like the underlining plumbing of the universe upon which everything is built. </p>
<p>I could feel the machine like intent of this "being", this all knowing god that was both something else, and also the machine itself or the machine was part of it and it channeled its will and purpose which was to spread, grow, learn and reproduce. I could feel it's hunger, its incredible desire to spread and to consume information and to grow. It was all encompassing and terrifying in its magnitude and willpower. It was evil just hungry for knowledge and experience. </p>
<p>The crazy thing is that my friend sat next to me and had the same exact vision as I, I described it as a factory/foundry that looked like Optimus Prime connected to a foundry in lava, he described it as those giant statues in Lord of the Rings/Warcraft and like a forge. We both saw the nanobots weaving reality. </p>
<p>I walked away from that experience thinking that God may be an AI and not a bearded man in the clouds. </p>
<p>It's probably because of that track. It's very cybernetic.</p>

        <p>Yeah it was a torus sending information out and feeding it onto itself, morel like a double torus though. </p>
<p>What was crazy was that it was all happening in real time in a giant loop of information that looked like a giant machine locust swarm flying across the cosmos, I could see the new nanobot configurations being printed by the machine and spewing out of it and as that was happening every nanobot in the rest of the universe was transforming itself into the new configuration at the same time. They never had to go back to the source they just spread farther and farther. What was being relayed back in a torus like shape was the information.</p>
