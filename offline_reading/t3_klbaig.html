    <strong>Regarding the recent troll posts full of vitriol</strong>
    <p><p>I know that the vast majority of these have been throwaway accounts posting things seemingly just to rile up anger, ready to be banned. Lots of ad hominem attacks, calling us crazy conspiracy theorists, that kind of thing. </p>
<p>But I can’t help but get slightly hopeful whenever I see one, like maybe one of these is a real person with some real anger, ready to discuss it. When I check their profiles and see that this is their first post and their account is 45 minutes old, I’m bummed. Not because I know they’re trolling, that’s obvious. It’s because I know they won’t respond before their post gets deleted.</p>
<p>I welcome their anger and passion. Especially if they think their reasoning is bulletproof and that the people they’re talking to are idiots. If they just spent one hour talking to some of the people here in good faith, I think the result would be life changing. </p>
<p>Part of the problem that we don’t address is the media sources that these people consume use people like us in this sub as scapegoats for the pandemic lockdown measures. “If your friends over there would just comply and shut the fuck up, there would be less death/less restrictions/shorter pandemic duration/whatever else will scare you into hating them”. They are coming here with some baggage already and in order to change that we need to keep it in mind.</p>
<p>When someone points something out that <em>might be eye opening</em> to SOME of us, I see far too many comments putting them down in the spirit of “oh, you’re just realizing this? I knew this long ago”. It’s not a fucking contest, let’s start helping people understand instead of shaming them for being late to the party. It’s good that you realized how fucked we were early on, but now I’m questioning why you sat back and felt superior instead of helping others come to similar realizations. </p>
<p>Some of the immediate comments under these troll posts are informative and honest, and I love to see that shit. I think knowledge and honest attempts at connection like that are wasted if the response from the mods here is usually to ban the original poster and remove the post. </p>
<p>This can’t just be two echo-chamber castles firing catapults at each other. Bridges have to be built. I want to understand all sides and I want to find common ground. There are intelligent people who want to be locked down, and I want to know and understand why. There are intelligent people who welcome mask mandates for what I would consider selfish and unselfish reasons. I want to empathize and not just make fun of them. I want them to know why we disagree, and I want to know that they understand my argument as well. We can’t just say “fuck you, sheep” and high five each other. That’s just as disgusting as their attempted trolling.</p>
<p>We are the people, and they are the people. The enemy is the system that turns good people into shit like what we’ve seen lately. The enemy is the purposeful exploitation of people’s natural instincts to help one another and preserve life and transforming those instincts into chains and weapons. </p>
<p>Next time you see a post by someone obviously new to this sub, no matter what their preconceived notions are, don’t prove to them that their friends and news channels were right. Ask a question. Engage them, see if we can get through their heads that we’re all people behind these screens and keyboards. We’re fucking human. All of us.</p></p>

        <p>No judgement bro, why are you here? This place is a great way to vent frustration in an environment that people won’t say you’re the problem, that’s another positive about the sub.</p>
