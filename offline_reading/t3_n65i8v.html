    <strong>Another small way to push back.</strong>
    <p><p>YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.</p>
<p>I was in a shop today and two of the staff (young, normal looking) were chatting and pretending to stack the shelves. </p>
<p>They had there masks down because, like most people, they are, at a minimum, tired of this nonsense and sense on some level that it's all horseshit.</p>
<p>Anyway, as they saw me coming they quickly pulled their masks up. The safety theatre of it was genuinely funny in the moment and I laughed out loud. I said to them, 'you don't need to do that' - because it's so strange and pointless to pretend to wear a mask like that.</p>
<p>I think there's a space there to push back against safety theatre by finding it ridiculous and saying so when you interact with someone who is obviously just pretending.</p></p>
