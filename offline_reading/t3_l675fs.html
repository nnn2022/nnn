    <strong>Sometimes I can’t believe this is all real.</strong>
    <p><p>Since this began, I don’t know anyone personally who has died of coronavirus. Not saying that other people haven’t lost loved ones to it, but for me personally, I have seen: 
- My aunt with dementia quickly going downhill when visitors or musical entertainment was not allowed in her nursing home. She died in October, and just a few of us got to attend the funeral, while the rest of her family friends could not. I firmly believe that she deteriorated quicker due to not having the same quality of life. 
- My uncle with chronic depression rot away in his home. People stopped visiting him (apart from my mother and I). The Irish government said that 90% of mental health services continued; that is a LIE. All of his activities stopped, like his weekly hospital visits for older people with mental health issues, his friend programme, everything. He has been alone in his house, with diabetes that he can’t even take care of. It’s gotten to the point where he is hallucinating religious figures. It’s freaking scary. 
- my granny’s closest friend had a serious stroke and was in hospital for about 6 months with NO visitors. This is downright cruelty. 
- my hospital appointment for my joint issues that I’ve been waiting on for 2 years cancelled 3 times. 
- An older lady with treatments delayed die from cancer. I don’t know if she would have died anyway, but to see her treated as if her issue was irrelevant was disgusting. 
- a loss of humanity in people. No matter what your stance is on this, the people who are very pro-lockdown and pro-mask are highly aggressive and demeaning towards people with different views, or even just people questioning things. 
 I am not the worst off in this situation and I am even struggling. I’m 22, had graduated college and started my first full time job. I lost my job, my masters course for next year was cancelled. I haven’t seen my dad in over a year because he lives in England. I used to suffer with anxiety and depression as a teenager, but had been doing great for years and now I feel like I used to back then. 
But who I really feel for are older people with not much time left, who believe they need to spend the remainder of their lives indoors with no contact. The people who are ill from other conditions and are treated as unimportant because it’s not coronavirus. People suffering in abusive relationships who are now cut off and isolated from family and friends. Children who come from rough or abusive households who aren’t allowed to go to school anymore. People in hospitals or nursing homes, alone and isolated with no visitors. Families who will never have closure on a loved ones death because they were not allowed to have a funeral. Young people who have just started off in life, with hopes and dreams, only to be met with this. Even all of the pets people selfishly bought for their own amusement during lockdowns, only to get rid of later on. 
Life is too short. I don’t want to be aggressive to people who are pro this and anti that. I just want to see a bit of humanity. And some thought for ALL people, not just people with this particular virus. Vent over.</p></p>

        <p>If Covid showed something it’s modern human nature. Most humans are a bunch of agressive sheeps and way too gullible in bowing down to the government. Modern humans(most of them) are weak, selfish and ignorant. Sorry to hear you had to experience that. Stay strong and hope there will be a solution to this. Myself I realized long ago the true face of society and how unfair, cruel and perverted it can be. Try to find peace in your soul, even if just a little bit. Take care buddy.</p>

        <p>Amen. Yesterday I was crossing the street and a lady gestured at me to put my mask on while I was 20 feet away from her. It bugs me to see how delusional people are.</p>
<p>Nowadays I feel that there are covert things the media, big figures or the government do under the the guise of 'caring' and it influences the general population who want to feel better about themselves and virtue signal.</p>
<p>You want to respect people but you cannot act calm when someone has a different opinion, vocabulary or ways of doing things, even though the person simply has a different opinion, they are evil and need to be corrected or else, in worse cases. People say I'm judgemental but they're telling me what words to use when I speak.</p>

        <p>I returned from Florida to New York yesterday.</p>
<p>I was met at the airport by National Guardsmen who demanded I inform the state government of all of my travel plans, and agree to pick up the phone to representatives, before I was allowed to leave the airport.</p>

        <p>The brazenness and inhumanity of it is <em>prima facie</em> support for the idea that it's all political. It's such a huge lie and such a big move that its scope seems almost calculated to appear, and to feel, impossible to doubt or question. Like Goebbels' "big lie"....</p>

        <p>The kinds of experiences you're describing really are saddening. To add another drop to the well of tears; there was a lady on my street who had cancer. She had a bad turn and so they took her into hospital, but she wasn't allowed visitors for the duration of her stay. The hospital eventually determined she had reached end of life, and so allowed her to be sent home to pass away surrounded by her family. She died alone in the ambulance on the journey home. It makes me sick.</p>
