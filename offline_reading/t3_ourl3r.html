        <p>I'm going to play dumb French person, and ask what is the meaning of this cartoon?</p>
<p>Because from my point of view it looks like the cartoon is trying to blame Mexicans for the bullshit President Biden is spewing...</p>
<p>Sorry, but what the hell?</p>
<p>I know there is a problem in the US with legal and illegal immigrants coming up from Mexico, but if you agree for even a fucking second with this cartoon, and I am only talking about this cartoon, then you are in exactly the same camp as every shit-for-brains idiot who is blaming those who do not trust the anti-COVID science experiment (aka. COVAX, aka. COVID "vaccine").</p>
<p><strong>ONCE AGAIN! I AM TALKING ABOUT THIS BULLSHIT PROPAGANDA PIECE OF A CARTOON! NOT ILLEGAL OR LEGAL IMMIGRANTS COMING UP FROM MEXICO!</strong></p>
<p>Do not fall for this shit. This cartoon is for those who want to blame someone, but can't blame themselves, and will not place the blame squarely where it belongs at the feet of our governments, the media, and the pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>This is just another "US vs. THEM" hit piece created to give the brain dead masses a different target than those truly responsible. Especially now that said brain dead masses are starting to wonder if WE (NNN, and the other "Conspiracy Theorists") are slowly but surely being proven correct.</p>

        <p>And if you believe that then my original statement still stands.</p>
<p>I understand there are issues with illegal immigrants. I hear about it often enough from the American side of my family.</p>
<p>But if you truly believe:</p>
<p>&rt;No, illegals are crossing the border illegally and being relocated to cities untested and unvaccinated therefore spreading the virus.</p>
<p>Then you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Believing that there is an actual and trustworthy test available.</li>
<li>That the COVAX injection actually works as advertised</li>
<li>~~Quite possibly a troll trying to infiltrate NNN and propagate a new version of the "US vs. THEM" narrative.~~</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT: My last point is discordant and possibly wrong due to personal biases.</p>

        <p>The border crisis is brought up a lot in response to COVID restrictions, mostly just to highlight the hypocrisy of forcing masks and vaccines on healthy Americans who want to work to put food on the table and buy groceries, meanwhile people who don’t even belong in the country can come and go as they please without restrictions. Illegal immigrants have more rights than actual citizens, essentially. No one who argues this is saying immigrants <em>should</em> be getting tested and vaxxed etc, it’s just holding the doomer’s to their inconsistent logic.</p>

        <p>I'll fully admit that I have a personal bias against the cartoon.</p>
<p>And as much as anyone in the USA thinks  "Illegal immigrants have more rights than actual citizens" I can assure you we've got it financially worst here in Europe than you do over there (We are for all intent an purpose some version of a socialist country to the point that our political right would still be left of center in the US).</p>
<p>But I will maintain that this is still an "Us vs. Them" hit piece meant to create discord, and to try to blame someone else for the BS the government and their lackeys is trying to shove down our throats.</p>
