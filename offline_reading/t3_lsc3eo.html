<p>For the past year, how many of you feel like you have been really <em>REALLY</em> living? As opposed to existing?</p>
<p>Heck, how many of you feel like you are almost sub-existing? </p>
<p>We are meant to live for more that what we are being subjugated to. To live does <em>not</em> mean guaranteed safety 100% of the time. Life is messy, we make mistakes, we fall, we get hurt, WE GET SICK. It is part of being human, it is a part of being alive. </p>
<p>We have the GOD GIVEN rights to live a complete life. Not some form of standby like we are currently. </p>
<p>Our rights are given to us NOT by the government, but by a higher power. Call it what you want- God, Allah, evolution. Whatever you wish to believe that higher power is, we are endowed with free will and agency, which has been infringed upon at nearly EVERY level of our lives. </p>
<p>We let it happen. Somewhere along the way (long prior to the pandemic) it was forgotten that WE are the holders of our rights. </p>
<p>The lockdowns and mandates are a travesty and gross violation of our rights.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah doing things but this isn't living at all, it's like the free trial version of life. You barely get any of the good stuff you actually came here for. Certain very powerful people think they can play the hand of god, they are no more of a force of god than anyone or anything on this planet.  Nothing but false idols. I think the only thing I can rest easy on is that it was meant to be like this by the way things have unfolded in the physical and all that interacts with it. Far more of a spiritual battle that has been going on longer than any of us have ever been alive. Ancient forces against ancient forces working against each other manifesting constantly through every single living thing on earth. Everything playing its role within the body of god.</p>

        <p>I’ve been saying this from the beginning they are taking away our free will which is a god given right.
Not to mention that not a single person ever dies in vain and that every person passes at the exact moment and manner in which they were supposed to. The big guy upstairs does not make mistakes. It’s only our perception that makes us think this.
Living in fear is living in what if, what could be and trying to control an outcome that may very well happen regardless of what you do.
Part of living is being happy and doing things that make you feel whole in every moment. When your living in the future, you can’t enjoy your now. 
When you break it down like this, it shows that this is all about control. They want to be able to control your every moment, thought and your future. 
It should be, what’s gonna happen is gonna happen.</p>
