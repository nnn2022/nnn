        <p>That's why the people at the top hate the free and open internet so much. Before the internet they had the monopoly on the flow of information, you were forced to believe whatever it was they presented to you on the TV or radio.</p>

        <p>The real question is how does anyone tell the difference? I'm very open-minded and while I believe the vaccine is legit and (no offense intended) I think most of the stuff on this subreddit is nonsense... This post, however, is the exact thing I'm wondering about... in two opposite ways.</p>
<p>1.) If you all are correct and I'm wrong, I want to know. I want to educate myself, but how can you trust any media at all? What makes the things you read more trustworthy than what the CDC says or "MSM"? In my opinion, it boils down to what you want to believe. People don't watch Fox news if they disagree with the opinions shared, they watch news with their own political slant. </p>
<p>Flat-earthers didn't come out of no where. They were laughed silent because the notion is ridiculous and there were probably 1 in 1000 people believed it and they rarely met each other. The internet has allowed these people to form a community that gave them a voice, but it doesn't make them correct.</p>
<p>2.) If you all are incorrect, how would you know? It's a cult-like mindset when you don't allow yourself to consider whether the "other" side is correct. I don't have an agenda here. I'm just genuinely curious how introspective communities like this are in general and what you think about this kind of thing.</p>

        <p>To the first part:  can’t really be 100% sure.  I usually watch foreign news (Australia, India, etc) about US affairs as I feel (although probably still are) less bias with a political agenda.  I watch left and right news and whatever they both have in common is probably true for ex. Fox: “American patriot went to moon.” And CNN “white supremacy spreads to the moon” then I can formulate that a man landed on the moon, but still don’t know 100% sure unless you were part of the team that put them there.  One part of destabilizing a government is to get the people to distrust the news and divide the people which whoever is doing it to the US has succeeded.<br>
Part 2. For me this boils down to what I see.  For example the lockdowns and covid shenanigans did not affect my daily work operations as deployed overseas.  In fact it was nice as I could go to work without traffic.  People at work got covid as you would expect but was just a cough and headache no worse then the flu.  Field hospitals were constructed and never used.  Whereas the media is saying hundreds of millions die daily from it.  Then I look at the statistics and see that most are 80+ or have a underlying health condition.  So the group of people I work with daily remain unaffected.  While it sucks people died it was really unavoidable if the sick and elderly wanted to go outside.  I believe those people needed to be quarantined, but they wanted the world shut down… why?  Now a day your treated as a second class citizen for not taking a vaccine for a disease realistically will not effect me.  And for the people that say “omg what about the sick, think about them” yes I did they need to be locked down and vaccinate (it works right?) 
But there is no risk for me and for people that already had it. (Sorry for long tangent)
Guess TLDR:  I formulate my own news based off of what I see and can control.</p>

        <p>To answer your questions on a broader front, the first thing you need to do is discover where YOU stand as person and what you want to see in this world. </p>
<p>From there you listen, listen to both sides to everything. Who do you agree with and why? Who do you disagree with and why? Listen, learn and evaluate both through your own words and ideas. </p>
<p>That said, a big trick to tell if someone or some group is full of shit or doesn't know what they're talking about, is to look at how they address big problems. </p>
<p>If they're constantly bitching about the big problems but don't offer any solutions, they're full of shit. If all they do is mock the only solutions available, they have no idea what they're talking about.</p>

        <p>I was once naive enough to believe social media was the cure for mass media disinformation. But the two actually work hand-in-hand. Censor everything except approved talking points and, with platforms like Twitter, those talking points suddenly seem "grassroots" and "common sense."</p>

        <p>"The daily press is the evil principle of the modern world, and time will only serve to disclose this fact with greater and greater clearness. The capacity of the newspaper for degeneration is sophistically without limit, since it can always sink lower and lower in its choice of readers. At last it will stir up all those dregs of humanity which no state or government can control." -Søren Kierkegaard</p>
