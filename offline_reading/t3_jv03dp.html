    <strong>Gyms are open but masks must be worn even while exercising, how do I cope?</strong>
    <p><p>Goodlife Fitness in Toronto has now introduced a masks on all the time policy now that gyms are reopening tomorrow with a 10-person limit. I can't afford to get banned. I swear to Christ I'm gonna be on the verge of a fucking panic attack if that thing is soaked with sweat and I'm breathing heavy through my lifts. On between sets I got used to but even the WHO says this isn't sanitary. I intend the first few days to ease back in to adjust but still it fucks with me. Girlfriend recommended putting it under my nose - can anyone who's living under such a regime and lifts heavy tell me if that will work to keep them off your back or if they're serious about making you waterboard yourself? I sweat like fucking crazy, always have. Current PRs bench 285 deadlift 345 squat 245.</p></p>

        <p>I had a membership at a gym in the suburbs during Toronto's gym closure. It expires on Thursday. It was an amazing experience but door to door it took nearly 2 hours to get there on my bike and the commuter train so I couldn't go more than twice a week because of the travel time. If lifting in a mask really is as shit as I worry it will be I'll renew my membership there and look into Zipcar or some other short-term car rental thing so using it is a realistic option.</p>

        <p>That’s a rough commute, but it sounds like it might be worth it. You don’t want to undo your gains by causing health problems for yourself from exercising in a mask. You breathe that shit out for reason, not to breathe it right back in. Especially when lifting is time to be kind to your lungs, heart, and muscles. Maybe if enough people cancel membership over the mask thing, the closer gym will change its policy.</p>

        <p>I'm optimistic the closer gym may change things considering they sent out a mass email telling members to email their MPP to demand reopening but considering Goodlife is Canada's largest gym chain if push comes to shove they will obey the law and not risk bad press. The whole reason I signed up is they have locations everywhere I can use at my convenience. It is a rough commute but I may just have to suck it up and eat the time and read a book on the train so it's not a total waste.</p>

        <p>I would do that for sure. I wouldn't even consider going to a gym that made me wear masks during exercise, but it sounds like you're really passionate about lifting and good at it, from those stats above.</p>

        <p>So far from what I've looked up both Zipcar and Enterprise CarShare do not have networks that extend to the suburbs. I get around literally everywhere in Toronto by bike including errands social visits grocery shopping and my job as a bike courier on a daily basis so buying a car is not economical as I have need for one a few times a year and just rent one for the road trip or borrow a friend's car for the specific out-of-town errand. Parking permits and insurance and gas are not worthwhile expenses for my current lifestyle. I'm going to call around the city for a gym that does not abide by municipal restrictions (who the fuck knows how I'll figure that out without raising the narc-alarm) but I am not optimistic I won't have options beyond just buying a fuckload of new masks for single gym use like some consoomer idiot and wearing them below my nose or just bite the bullet and accept that I'm spending all my day outside of work sitting on a train reading a book to go lift in the suburbs and having no time for anything else.</p>

        <p>It's completely retarded. I should have known as soon as they put that fucking chart on the wall that this was a possibility. It's a corporate chain so they obey the law, because it's fucking Canada and we value peace order and good government. Fuck this shit I'd rather live in America and have no health insurance. I haven't needed a hospital in 10 years, I take care of my body, what the fuck am I paying into OHIP for when the state fucks me over like this for "health reasons". If I lived in the states I wouldn't have to lift weight to win fights because I could buy a gun without jumping through hoops and being on a list or hanging around crack dealers to get an illegal one.</p>

        <p>Nice lifts. Why is your squat so (comparatively) low? </p>
<p>It sucks. Especially towards the end of a workout when everything is wet and hard to breathe. Here's what I do: Take a surgical mask and cut out 2 of the three layers from the back. The last layer is very easy to breathe through. Nowhere I've seen has requirements on the actual material of the mask, so hopefully this works for you! I was using a thin gaiter previously but that still got very hot. </p>
<p>I had a 225/405/375 a few years ago but I'm focusing more on other sports now so they're much lower.</p>

        <p>I'm a bike courier. Haven't really done a proper leg day on the weights beyond just fucking around as I don't want to exhaust myself so I can't work. It's the same reason I don't go for runs all that often, legs and cardio is to get paid, most of my take-home is based on how fast I can ride. Make deliveries faster and you can fit in more pickups and get better tips. Obviously I'm short-changing myself as all professional cyclists can squat serious plates.</p>

        <p>The shitty "surgical" masks you now see everywhere have 3 layers. Cut two of them out and make multiple slits along the folds/creases so they are less noticeable, but you can breathe. It is fucked up that we are being asked to mask up during exercise, but if you need to go to the gym, that's my advice.</p>

        <p>Well that's what I keep saying about masks. When something hinders physical performance it also detriments your health. It's like lifting weights or sprinting while smoking. It's equivalent. It damages your health.</p>
<p>What can you do? I would invest buying my own equipment and getting a more spacious place to fit them in. Second hand fitness stuff is cheaper these days as many are scared of "infected equipment". The space is the real issue if you are in an apartment. The other possibility are the underground gyms if you have contacts (I would ask in boxing clubs, or similar).</p>

        <p>Vigorous physical activity while masked is a dangerous practice. It has already killed people. You can suffer a lung collapse doing that. Seriously.</p>
<p>No workout is worth dying for. I would cancel my membership and tell them why. I'd also demand to be compensated for the time on your membership when they had the gym shut down. Clear that one with a lawyer, but I think you'd have a solid case.</p>

        <p>I skimmed the post so sorry if you answered this but, can you take off your mask when you get to the equipment you want? That’s how it works in my gym. Wear the mask while walking around but you can take it off when you get to where you want to be. I also don’t put the mask on all the way while walking from place to place, I just hold it over my mouth. No one has said anything so far..</p>

        <p>I quit my gym 4 months ago over this issue and told them exactly why. They said I could sign some sort of waiver, but I said I didn't want to have to jump through hoops just to work out normally while subjecting myself to scorn and judgment from the other sheep. I LOVED the gym too, and had been going for all of my adult life. I bought some free weights, a kettlebell, and some resistance bands and have been working out at home ever since. Don't miss the gym at all and don't think I'll ever go back.</p>
<p>The only way to truly protest is to not financially support businesses who require these types of things. When their wallet starts hurting, they'll begin to care.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to rant, but that sort of thing is the most superstitious garbage I've ever heard of. I could tell you that the only way to fend off this virus is to apply incense to yourself for two hours, and that would be LESS superstitious than what this rule is insinuating.</p>
<p>I have the exact same problem at my university. At my university's gym, you can always see people there, who don't even look like they exercise to begin with, policing people who are actively lifting weights or going on treadmills to wear their masks at all times despite the fact that wearing the masks makes you feel like you're suffocating. Even if that wasn't the case, 95% of the equipment is, to put it in their dystopian language, "socially distanced" from the rest of the equipment, and many of the treadmills and other cardio equipment is, like, four feet away from a brick wall as is! Who am I going to get sick by not wearing my mask in that situation? Some fly on the wall? Surely they aren't suggesting that someone else is going to get sick from me facing a wall for an hour!</p>
<p>And besides, as it's been stated many times over, the World Health Organization itself suggested that face masks while exercising DON'T WORK! Never mind the fact that most people, especially including the doomers, wear crappily weaved-together, decorative masks that are about as effective in stopping a virus as locking lips with someone. Even the WHO, the exact same organization that pushes for eternal mask-wearing, is suggesting that this is wrong, yet the ignorance of some people triumphs over even the WHO at this point.</p>
<p>Anyways, do yourself a favor and get out of that gym until they snap out of their delusions and actually give their customers the ability to do an honest day's workout. I abandoned my university's gym a long time ago and expect to continue doing so until they promptly remove this superstitious practice from their gym once and for all.</p>

        <p>Any recommendations for a gym mask? The masks I use typically have poor ventilation and towards end it feels like being waterboarded with own sweat.</p>
