    <strong>I'm just about done with all this "new variant" talk.</strong>
    <p><p>Like... are people dumb? I mean, obviously they are, but the extent of human gullibility never ceases to surprise me.</p>
<p>There was literally no discussion of "new strains" before the vaccine was authorized. Now that they have been, it's all anyone can talk about.</p>
<p>How on earth is this concern coming to light just now? If this was a serious concern, we should have been hearing about it long before the release of the vaccine.</p>
<p>It feels like governments and MSM were saving up this angle for when they could use it to fearmonger the hardest, and now they've fired it like a slingshot on a bunch of naive, unsuspecting sheeple.</p>
<p>Either the risk is being way overblown, or it was hidden from us so we would naively think "lockdown until vaccine!" only to find that the vaccine doesn't actually help, and no shit, we've gotta lockdown harder as usual!!!</p></p>

        <p>Yup. Forbes magazine, written by a Stein.</p>
<p>Came out right at the beginning of lockdown I remember because I shared it on FB. That was all I needed to see to convince me that the powers have finally gained complete control.</p>
<p>When magazines start writing “don’t think for yourself” and the majority of people can’t even comprehend a problem with that. Well, I think that’s the beginning of the end for humanity.</p>
<p>Maybe the elites are right tbh, maybe I would come to their conclusion too if I was them. Most of us are unthinking idiots who contribute nothing but shit and piss. </p>
<p>Last year happened because the elites think we’re scum. Our pathetic reaction proved them right.</p>

        <p>They don't. Way too many people on this sub say "masks don't work. don't use them" with them smugly linking a study to validate their claim only to have the conclusion of the study literally say the opposite. There's a reading comprehension problem in this country.</p>

        <p>Show me the study that unequivocally proves masks to help stop the spread of this virus.</p>
<p>Ill wait. Masks don’t work like how you are being told. Sorry you fell for it. Learning from your mistakes is how to grow as a person, rather than hanging around on a forum of people your subconscious agrees with but your ego won’t allow. It’s strange.</p>
<p>Aso, the world is bigger than your country. Fucking yanks and their self centred reality. Can you not see how talking like your country is the only thing to exist makes people see you? </p>
<p>You have a comprehension problem if you think masks help to do anything. The info has always been out there for you to consume but people choose to let the TV tell them how to think.</p>

        <p>There is no evidence that masks "unequivocally stop" the virus because, like most things made by humans, it's not perfect and it's subject to different circumstances. They slow the spread. masks have around 50-95% effectiveness rate in reducing exposure to the virus particles (depending on how it is being transmitted). Saying masks don't work because it doesn't block 100% of the particles is like saying that the polio vaccine doesn't work because it only has a 90% effectiveness rate. </p>
<p>Here's a comprehensive website that condenses what the data says about masks. Trust the science, not the voodoo doctors Del Bigtree puts on his show. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02801-8">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02801-8</a></p>

        <p>I don't even know who that person is that you mentioned. That's a terrible way to argue. I'm not American, I hate how you people assume that everyone is from your country. </p>
<p>I asked for a study and all I got was "they slow the spread". You are telling me to trust the science but instead of sending me any scientific papers you send me an article. I'm not interested in propaganda, I have read all the studies since March last year and their conclusions range from masks do nothing at all to masks aerosolise and actually make the spread wrose not to mention make your life more uncomfortable and make it more likely to catch something. All I have done all year is read scientific papers to get to the bottom of all this while you MSM junkies scram at me for not following the science. There are no scientific studies that prove asymptomatic spread either. That is also a lie. </p>
<p>I am not ill, therefore I will not wear a mask. I am very open to science but you have not provided me with any.</p>

<p><strong>"I asked for a study and all I got was 'they slow the spread'</strong> Because that's what the studies say. </p>
<p><strong>"You are telling me to trust the science but instead of sending me any scientific papers you send me an article."</strong> </p>
<p>The article literally cites scientific studies and it has a references tab at the end. You can do your research properly by going through each reference individually and judging them by yourself. Of course, you won't because you're already dug in on the idea that masks don't work, period, but you should if you actually wanted to learn a thing or two. The Nature magazine (the website I linked)  is a peer-reviewed scientific magazine and it's also one of the most prestigious academic journals. The fact that you immediately dismissed it without looking to see if Nature magazine was a reputable source explains why your positions are poorly researched. You have to verify the curator of the information.  </p>
<p><strong>" I'm not interested in propaganda, I have read all the studies since March last year and their conclusions range from masks do nothing at all to masks aerosolise and actually make the spread wrose not to mention make your life more uncomfortable and make it more likely to catch something."</strong></p>
<p>Studies from last march may not be accurate now because of new discoveries. Science evolves over time as more information becomes available. I'd like to see which studies you've seen saying that masks "don't do nothing at all" because you're either cherry-picking the part you like or you're misinterpreting the study. More often than not, it's a combination of both for you people. Even studies from the start of the pandemic that said that it wasn't entirely clear if masks could slow the spread, said that it still had the potential to do so and it should be encouraged. That's what this study from April suggests. Since then, we've had more and more testing to suggests that masks DO reduce the potential for spread.   <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1435.short">https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1435.short</a></p>
<p><strong>"There are no scientific studies that prove asymptomatic spread either. That is also a lie."</strong></p>
<p>Really? Cite your sources for this claim, then. Not only is symptomatic spread real, but there's also a potential of making the virus less dangerous by increasing mask usage and asymptomatic spread. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026913">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026913</a></p>
<p>We've also known that asymptomatic spread happens. Here's a review all the way back from September of 2020 <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-3012">https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-3012</a></p>
<p>Here's another article from Nature magazine that talks about the asymptomatic spread <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3</a></p>
<p><strong>"I  am not ill, therefore I will not wear a mask."</strong> </p>
<p>Doesn't mean shit. You still need to wear a mask.  Some people with COVID-19, or other viruses, will be visibly sick. However, many people with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic, which means they feel perfectly healthy. Asymptomatic patients feel well and appear fine to others. They can still spread a virus to others and therefore can make other people sick. While the COVID-19 pandemic continues, both healthy and sick people should wear masks or face coverings while around others to try to prevent the spread of the virus.  Here's a couple of links you can play scientist with </p>

        <p>You haven't sent me a thing to rebuke my points or a study saying that masks don't work and people should stop using them, or that asymptomatic spread doesn't happen. If you can't support your claims, then your dystopia lives in your head. You know, sometimes, the simplest explanation is the best.</p>

<p>we have multiple credible sources telling us conflicting information. this is a fact. without further research, are we just supposed to guesss which is correct? believe whichever is more convenient?  of course not, we go get to the bottom of it. I’m not going to blindly follow what anyone says, and I’m going to be especially cautious of the advice of someone who just told me not to think for myself.</p>

        <p>“Oh well life goes on” does not bring back all the suicides and the bankrupt small businesses.</p>
<p>People might say “oh well” to you but it’s not good enough, gyms are still closed, protesting is still illegal.</p>
<p>Things need to drastically change. Forgive me if some people saying “oh well” doesn’t fill me with hope. The same thing will happen over and over. Most people are surprised when they find out the vaccine won’t get their freedom back even though the TV openly tells them as much. People are really fucking stupid and it’s only getting worse.</p>

        <p>This is looking so contrived. I find it oddly convenient how the variants suddenly popped up when it looked like we had the regular coronavirus under control. What's looking just as contrived, if not more so, is the notion popping up here and there that the vaccines may not be effective against the variants.</p>

        <p>&rt;If this was a serious concern, we should have been hearing about it long before the release of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Ironically there was a coordinated propaganda/MSM campaign to address the publics concern of viral mutation (and that the vaccine may be ineffective).</p>
<p>The summary was "it is unlikely to mutate but if it does, it is likely to be less virulent".</p>
<p>Now that we have all these strains that have supposedly mutated (a surprise to no one, viruses do this all the time) now we are to believe that these vaccines are effective against the mutated strains as well?</p>
<p>It's a coordinated campaign to not only increase vaccine uptake since people apparently aren't afraid enough to get it in large enough numbers now, AND justify newer covid vaccines to address the new strains.</p>
<p>It's almost like this is never supposed to end or something.</p>
<p>Nah, crazy conspiracy theory. It's just a PANDEMIC. Just gotta BELIEVE in the SCIENCE.</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter anyways. Just stay focused on the fact that 99.x % of people experience cold-like symptoms and 95% of those who die have a co-morbidity in the first place.Any societal reaction to this is an over-reaction. Period.The global cabal (Whatever the fuck that is) needed to rig the US election...um sorry FORTIFY... the election and mail-in ballot harvesting was already proven effective in CA in 2016.

        <p>People should really get some basic biology knowledge, then they will be immune to such fearmongering. There's millions of different types of viruses, they mutate, most of the mutations don't do much, the well-functioning immune system will cover them all.

        <p>Here's a source to help you understand the "talk about new variants' which isn't new nor is it unexpected. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know">https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know</a></p>
<p>Variants of viruses occur when there is a change (mutation) to the virus’s genes. Ray says it is the nature of RNA viruses such as the coronavirus to evolve and change gradually. “Geographic separation tends to result in genetically distinct variants,” he says.</p>
<p>Mutations in viruses, including the coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic, are neither new nor unexpected. Bollinger explains: “All RNA viruses mutate over time, some more than others. For example, flu viruses change often, which is why doctors recommend that you get a new flu vaccine every year."</p>
<p>He notes that one mutated version of the coronavirus was detected in southeastern England in September 2020. That variant, now known as B.1.1.7, quickly became the most common version of the coronavirus in the United Kingdom, accounting for about 60% of new COVID-19 cases in December. Other variants have emerged in South Africa, Brazil, California and other areas. </p>
<p>“We deal with mutations every year for flu virus, and will keep an eye on this coronavirus and track it,” says Bollinger. “If there would ever be a major mutation, the vaccine development process can accommodate changes, if necessary, but we’re not yet at the point when we need to consider that,” he explains.</p>

        <p>There was talk about new strains before the vaccine though.  Dating back to summer of 2020.  This is a natural thing and occurs with pandemics like this.</p>

        <p>&rt; There was literally no discussion of "new strains" before the vaccine was authorized. Now that they have been, it's all anyone can talk about.</p>
<p>Every epidemiologist and virologist was calling this out from the very beginning. One of the principle issues with viruses is their ability to mutate into new strains so this is not new. This is the fundamental reason why people need a flu shot every year is the genetic variation.</p>
<p>Here (1) is a paper from March 2020 detailing the genetic variations that show at least 8 different lineages</p>
<p>Here (2) is a paper from May that is a cladistic analysis of COVID-19 showing just how variable it is</p>
<p>You have to have had your head in the sand to say what you are saying. There were plenty of discussions on new strains and variants but it's far more critical now since we have vaccines and need to understand what variants exist and which vaccines are most appropriate for which. The Astra-Zeneca vaccine is 90% effective against the original strain but only 10% against the SA strain - don't you think that this is newsworthy?</p>

        <p>I don’t know if you understand what I’m implying. Despite the fact that the information was available and experts were talking about it, it was only popularized in mainstream media during December of 2020.</p>

        <p>The first major variant was discovered in the UK in September and it took until Nov/Dec for it to be prevalent enough to be an issue and for people to understand whether this variant meant a change in behaviour - either in infectivity or mortality. The first vaccine was approved in the UK in December. Given the vaccine is created from the original variant it was only really then that people really started to become concerned about what this would mean to immunisations.</p>
<p>I cannot comment on your choice of media outlets or the failings of scientific reporting but your rant above is patently wrong in that the MSM reported it as soon as it became relevant to the general public.</p>

        <p>Bold argument, viruses mutate, can't deny that. Many people were talking about variants before the vaccine, evidently, they aren't the people you're listening to. Seems to be a persistent problem, considering I cannot think of a single serious public health official that claimed everything would go back to normal when we got a vaccine. Not to mention, the vaccines we have are likely to work on almost all the variants, and if they don't, it's much easier to adjust a vaccine for a variant than it is to make a new vaccine, so the timeline would be short. Beyond that, almost every legitimate public health official I can think of was telling people the vaccine would likely work on the variants, so if they were trying to scare people, they were doing quite a shit job. To summarize, this is not the conspiracy you think it is.</p>
