    <strong>Why is the pandemic dragging out? As in all things, follow the money.</strong>
    <p><p>I really haven't seen too much discussion of this particular topic.  A lot of people point at the vaccines as the ultimate money maker.  I would like to simply comment on testing.</p>
<p>In the US, testing is everywhere.  I have friends who are NCAA athletes, they test twice a week.  Everyone is familiar with people who travel, or are going to see family so they get tested first.  Universities require random testing of students. The US is doing something around 1.2 to 1.3 MILLION tests per day.  </p>
<p>Local Governments go into full on freak out mode if positivity rates are 10%.  So 90% of these are really unnecessary.  I won't go into the  problem of false positives with PCR tests.  At high CT rates some say as high as 90%.    But that is really neither here nor there.  1.2 Million tests a day.</p>
<p>Now for most people these tests are free.  Which is to say you don't pay for it directly.  It's paid by insurance, or the university, or your employer, or provided "free" by local governments.  Which means you pay for it in tuition, or taxes, or insurance premiums.  But make no mistake: that money is coming from you in some form. </p>
<p>So basic math;  The average cost of a PCR Covid test is about $150.  Times 1.2 Million PER DAY.  That's  (carry  the 1, check the zeroes) yep <strong>180 Million Dollars Per Day</strong>.  In testing. Not to treat people. Not to protect them.  Testing.</p>
<p>Every month this thing drags out the medical industry pockets (well not pockets, it's not all profit, but grosses) <strong>nearly 5.5 Billion US Dollars.</strong>  In health care products that really no one wants.  This is money not spent on, well anything else.  Not prevention, not pre-natal care, not cancer research, not nothing. </p>
<p>So the industry charged with ending this has a fairly large financial incentive not to.</p></p>

        <p>I remember seeing the amount that the Ontario government spends on tests PER DAY and almost wet my pants. What a waste, when the test isn't even very accurate. I can't remember the exact figure.</p>

        <p>I doubt they are getting charged 150 a test, that's a retail price, but your point is still a good one</p>

        <p>It's a very fair point.   Determining the actual cost of any medical care is about like reading tea leaves. Sure, some state government can negotiate or strongarm a bulk discount.    But I quote from an older issue of <em>Health Spending</em></p>
<p>tl;dr  The test is one part, the sample collection another, the office visit if necessary yet another.  $150 all in on average cost could be off by a quite bit in either direction.  If you are getting a discount, someone else is kicking in the difference. </p>
<p>&rt; Self-pay rates. Twelve hospitals listed the exact discounted rate or price of COVID-19 diagnostic tests for self-pay individuals, which ranged between $36 to $180 per test. A number of additional hospitals indicated on their websites that uninsured or self-pay individuals who didn’t qualify for governmental programs such as Medicaid could receive free or discounted care through hospital financial assistance programs. Patients receiving discounts would be charged for a portion of the listed price (e.g. 75% or 50% of the list price), though finding the exact amount of the discount can be challenging and often entails contacting the hospital to apply for discounted care.</p>
<p>&rt;Related costs. Aside from the cost of a diagnostic test itself, hospitals also bill for specimen collection and the office visit itself, whether in-person or through telemedicine. In most cases, the total cost of care for a test and its related services was not easily distinguishable on hospital websites. However, 13 hospitals clearly posted the list price for specimen collection, which ranged from $18- $200. One hospital listed three different charges based on where the specimen was collected – in a skilled nursing facility, at home, or an outpatient setting.</p>
<p>&rt;Many hospitals require patients to receive provider referral for testing, or require patients to meet CDC guidelines for symptoms before they can receive a test. For self-pay individuals, the cost of screening as well as testing may add up. For instance, one hospital’s price estimator tool demonstrated that the price of COVID-19 screening would be $77 before discounts, and $31 after applying a 60% discount for qualifying self-pay individuals. Such charges in addition to the cost of a diagnostic test and specimen collection can be financially burdensome or prohibitive for uninsured or self-pay patients, especially given the current labor market and high rates of unemployment.</p>

<p>The global central banks want a single, digital currency that can be monitored and controlled based on your “contributions” to the New Order. It’s a huge undertaking and this pandemic is going to last until they’ve accomplished their goals.</p>

        <p>It's one of those problems that can not be quickly solved by throwing money at it.  Trained personnel is the bottleneck, and it's not one quickly or easily solved.</p>
<p>There are those (I may be one) who would say that the AMA artificially limits the number of licensed doctors and nurses to keep incomes high. (supply and demand). Residency requirements force doctors-to-be to work long hours for slave wages to be eventually certified while hundreds of thousands of med school graduates can not get residencies.</p>

        <p>This is very true. My mum knows people who work for the NHS who had nothing to do for months, and people in healthcare who were laid off in the spring (there were a lot of layoffs), but we also know someone who works for the NHS and is finding the amount of work very difficult. It might not solve the problem entirely, but bringing back staff who were laid off would be a start. Money can expand capacity, which doesn't solve the problem either but would help.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm not sure what we can do to fix this problem - the NHS struggle every flu season so really we should have fixed the problem years ago. But we should still be trying to solve it directly instead of with lockdown. Plus is no one thinking about the future? What happens when the hospitals open up and all the delayed treatments start being dealt with? Will they not be overwhelmed or at least have a ridiculously long waiting list because of this?</p>
