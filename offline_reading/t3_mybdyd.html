    <strong>Every employer in the US requiring face masks is likely breaking OSHA regulations.</strong>
    <p><p>Back when all this started, I called our local government agency on the subject of mandatory face masks and asked if the OSHA rules for respirators were suspended.  I got bounced to another agency and another.  In effect, I got no answer.</p>
<p>https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134</p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<p>1910.134(c)(1)
In any workplace where respirators are necessary to protect the health of the employee or whenever respirators are required by the employer, the employer shall establish and implement a written respiratory protection program with worksite-specific procedures. </p>
<p>1910.134(c)(1)(i)
Procedures for selecting respirators for use in the workplace</p>
<p>1910.134(c)(1)(ii)
Medical evaluations of employees required to use respirators</p>
<p>1910.134(c)(1)(iii)
Fit testing procedures for tight-fitting respirators</p>
<p>1910.134(e)
Medical evaluation. Using a respirator may place a physiological burden on employees that varies with the type of respirator worn, the job and workplace conditions in which the respirator is used, and the medical status of the employee. Accordingly, this paragraph specifies the minimum requirements for medical evaluation that employers must implement to determine the employee's ability to use a respirator.</p>
<p>1910.134(c)(2)(ii)
In addition, the employer must establish and implement those elements of a written respiratory protection program necessary to ensure that any employee using a respirator voluntarily is medically able to use that respirator, and that the respirator is cleaned, stored, and maintained so that its use does not present a health hazard to the user. Exception: Employers are not required to include in a written respiratory protection program those employees whose only use of respirators involves the voluntary use of filtering facepieces (dust masks).</p>
<p>TLDR:  Masks being required of employees is covered under OSHA rule 1910.134.   Even a 'dust mask' (filtering facepiece) is considered a respirator.   Employers must get a licensed physician to do a medical evaluation of anyone required to wear a mask.   They must do fit testing.   They must have a documented program and administrator for the program.</p></p>

<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework#what-workers-need-to-know"><strong>Face Coverings,</strong></a> either cloth face coverings or surgical masks, are simple barriers that help prevent respiratory droplets from your nose and mouth from reaching others. Face coverings protect those around you, in case you are infected but do not know it, and can also reduce your own exposure to infection in certain circumstances. Wearing a face covering is complementary to and not a replacement for physical distancing.</p>
<p>They do not filter the air that the wearer breathes in like an N95 mask or respirator does. It's the filtering of incoming air that can cause health problems.</p>

        <p>This is recently invented gibberish. Ignoring it or condemning it as obviously politically motivated propagandizing is the only self-respecting approach.</p>
<p>Dust masks used to be considered a respirator by OSHA. I used to be a model maker in high end arch settings and am familiar with the OSHA rules as well as the resulting SOPs involved in asking employees [of the type employed at high end arch firms] to wear masks day after day as part of their job.</p>

        <p>Dust masks ARE still considered respirators. They filter the air that you breathe in. N95 masks are also respirators as they also filter the air you breathe in.</p>
<p>These are different from face coverings (cloth masks and surgical masks, not dust masks or respirators), which are defined ONLY as preventing respiratory droplets from the wearer reaching others. Face coverings DO NOT filter the air you breathe in, so they cannot harm the wearer.</p>
<p>The difference between a respirator and a face covering is that one filters the air for the wearer (respirator) while the other does not filter the air for the wearer (face covering). This is an IMPORTANT distinction because if the air is being filtered, it can cause problems with breathing. That is why OSHA laws are strict on respirators, but not on face coverings, because face coverings do not cause problems with breathing.</p>
<p>That is the issue with what the OP is saying, his initial question was what the rules were for "masks" which are  not respirators. He cited laws regarding respirators when his question was about face coverings. This is not very prudent of the OP to reach the conclusions he has.</p>

        <p>They supposedly block aerosols from infected persons breathing out, reducing the amount that they spread to others. The aerosols that get blocked are larger than the pores.</p>
<p>I suppose the reason for why the mask doesn't protect against breathing in aerosols is because the aerosols get smaller when in the air, probably due to evaporation. So it can be blocked from the person who exhales it, but not the person who inhales it.</p>

        <p>I guess I will comment again what the purpose of face coverings is since you didn't read it the first time.</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework#what-workers-need-to-know"><strong>Face Coverings,</strong></a> either cloth face coverings or surgical masks, are simple barriers that help prevent respiratory droplets from your nose and mouth from reaching others. Face coverings protect those around you, in case you are infected but do not know it, and can also reduce your own exposure to infection in certain circumstances. Wearing a face covering is complementary to and not a replacement for physical distancing.</p>
<p>They do not filter ANYTHING for what the wearer is breathing in, only what they are breathing out.</p>

        <p>Hey man, TheBonesm, is right here. You need to come correct. Your argument is flaud from a technical perspective. I totally hate masks and will not be getting the jab. All that stuff, but OSHAs standards you reference are talking about tight fighting respirators that require fit testing. Blue surgical masks or cloth face coverings are not covered under this regulation.</p>

        <p>Can I see the source on that? Because they don't say anywhere that a face covering is a respirator.</p>
<p>They make the clear distinction between face coverings and respirators <a href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework#what-workers-need-to-know">here</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;Provide all workers with face coverings (i.e., cloth face coverings, surgical masks), unless their work task requires a respirator.</p>

        <p>You guys do realize by now that something being against the law or unconstitutional does not matter anymore right? They can and will do whatever they want to you, because "it's an emergency" and "it's for your safety".</p>
<p>So we can stop with the crap about "uh actually it's ILLEGAL for Walmart to require you to wear a mask because of XYZ!" or "it's ILLEGAL for a business to ask for your private health information!" because IT DOESN'T MATTER. And if it ever does matter, they will just change the laws.</p>

        <p>I’m waiting to be arrested for not wearing a mask lol. I honestly would be so happy if walmart called the police on me because I wouldn’t give a name and demand to be arrested. The police probably wouldn’t even show up. Its my freedom of religion which is protected under the constitution so any cop wouldn’t touch it because I would spend the money on the best lawyer and file multiple lawsuits against the police and walmart for violation of my civil rights. I want to be able to file the lawsuits but so far nobody even says anything to me about not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>I’d rather be arrested standing up for what I believe in is my point. I don’t care whether or not I get arrested I know where I stand with God and thats all that matters now. My point is I’ve yet to even have anyone argue with me about not wearing a mask. If the police arrived and I tell them I don’t for religious reasons there’s nothing they can do really. It hasn’t even gotten to that point but if I were arrested i’d be filling lawsuits for violations of my civil rights and would most likely get settled out of court but I will win that lawsuit and the police know this which is why arrest is very unlikely at least in America . Other people have already won lawsuits in state supreme courts so case law is already being set that companies can Not force you to wear a mask nor can the state. American Police have actually been pretty good about not enforcing the BS covid policies especially in places like commiefornia</p>

        <p>Yes I do believe i’ll never be arrested in the first place. Not looking for a payout just want to go to court over it but my point is it would never get to a trial with a jury of my peers. The state would never prosecute me for it and most likely drop the charges and or offer a settlement.</p>

        <p>You’d be charged with trespassing, at worst.  It’s a misdemeanor, handled in municipal court.  Really, spend your fantasy time on something else.  The people who believe in masks mostly look at non-maskers as slightly annoying kooks, not freedom fighters who need to be oppressed by the power of the state.</p>

        <p>Also my state will be dropping the Mask Mandate regardless so it really doesn’t matter at this point but no I was never going to be charged for trespassing because once you are formally trespassed by police they escort you off the property and thats all that would happen unless I resisted. I could be arrested if I returned after that formal trespass Theres other ways to fight things in court than with the police on the street. Also yes misdemeanors do go to trial with a jury but typically only about 5% of all cases ever go to trial, usually some sort of plea deal or settlement happens before it ever goes to trial.</p>

        <p>Not to get all lawyer-y on you, but the answer to this depends on the state and the charge.  The Constitutional hurdle is a potential jail term of 6 months; if its less than that, you don’t have a right to a jury trial.  It’s classified as a petty misdemeanor in most states.  Getting kicked out of Walmart because you won’t wear a mask would very likely lead to a petty misdemeanor trespassing charge, because again, most jurisdictions are just treating anti-maskers as annoying kooks.  A “religious belief” that you don’t have to wear a mask is just one more level of kookiness.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, you're right. Referring to laws and basic human rights no longer holds water. Anything that isn't word vomited from propaganda sources is "unscientific," "biased," "harmful," "conspiracy theory," "subhuman," etc. These words now overrule actual science, law and reason (not that all laws make sense, but you catch my drift). It is fucking pathetic and I truly feel sorry for any child having to grow up in this fucked up dystopia where seeing someone's entire face is now truly scary.</p>

        <p>No, that is not true. In fact, there are many lawsuits pending right now on people and businesses forcing the mask before entry and forcing it onto those medically unable to wear them. If I thought that the law could be thrown out the window, I would not be fighting for freedoms by writing letters to Congress and the President.</p>

        <p>Bingo. The laws have been tossed out the window when they started getting police to patrol beaches and kick people off because they were violating Emergency Health Orders.

        <p>I work at a job that requires respirator use (though not the entire campus, just my group) so unfortunately this doesn’t help me. However, I see people at my job put on respirators OVER THEIR CLOTH MASK. We are not allowed to grow facial hair because that interferes with the effectiveness of the respirator but that goes out the window when it comes to showing allegiance to The Party. These people are more scared of breaking rules than the virus and it will negatively impact their health in the long run.</p>

        <p>Here is their definition on a dust mask:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong><em>Filtering facepiece (dust mask)</em></strong> means a negative pressure particulate respirator with a filter as an integral part of the facepiece or with the entire facepiece composed of the filtering medium. </p>
<p>Negative pressure particulate respirators seem to include <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2010-01-29">N95 masks</a> but not cloth or surgical masks.</p>
<p>So it seems that these laws are only regarding respirators (the gas mask looking things or N95 masks), not <a href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/safework#what-workers-need-to-know">face coverings</a>. Cloth masks and surgical masks would be considered face coverings as they are not respirators. So mandatory cloth mask and surgical mask requirements would not be subject to these laws on respirators.</p>

        <p>But cloth masks and surgical masks operate differently than N95 masks or respirators. Face coverings (cloth masks and surgical masks) do not filter what the wearer is breathing in, they are solely used to prevent water droplets from spreading in the air. Respirators do offer protection for the wearer, unlike face coverings. It makes sense why they are classified differently.</p>

<p>Face coverings are defined differently from respirators. The OP cited laws on respirators, when he should have cited laws on face coverings. This is because respirators function differently from face coverings and thus have different health effects on the wearer. While someone may be unable to use a respirator due to breathing problems, they are still able to wear a face covering because face coverings don't do anything to incoming air you are breathing in. The sole purpose of a face covering is to prevent the wearer from spreading respiratory droplets they exhale.</p>

<p>Honestly you guys, this isn't some magical new hidden news. Anti-maskers have been fighting masks since the beginning, and laws poured over. You think <em>nobody</em> has thought of the OSHA route? This was placed to them a number of times. It doesn't violate it.</p>

<p>A facial covering is not a respirator. Respirators require an air tight seal, clean shaven face, and what's mentioned in your post.</p>
<p>Dust masks or n95s do not. The facility I work in has a fair bit of dust. They provide dust masks but not respirators because of the osha bs they would have to go through. </p>
<p>To your credit it just proves masks aren't doing a fucking thing. But don't be stupid enough to believe a little bandana over your face should be classified the same as a respirator by OSHA.</p>

        <p>&rt; air tight seal, clean shaven face,</p>
<p>In most cases, but not all.  In the 1990s I had to wear either a full face respirator when handling NH4OH or half face when handling Diatomaceous Earth as part of the process I was working on.  In both cases I either sported a Horseshoe mustache or a circle beard.  Fit tested annually with isoamyl acetate (banana oil) to detect leaks.  Passed every time.</p>

        <p>this is why they haven't used OSHA to enforce the mask mandate. There was that threat by Biden before he took office, then when he got in he said OSHA would have a order within 30 days. We are here and OSHA hasn't said anything. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If OSHA says that you are required to wear a mask then every job would be required to provide a n95 mask to every employee. Since that isn't possible they aren't saying anything.</p>

        <p>A surgical mask is not considered a respirator.  I have been fitted for a respirator in the past and I currently work where surgical-type masks are required in the processing areas.  They are not the same thing.  No special training is required for wearing a surgical mask.  They are meant to protect the product from being spit or drooled in, just like they are meant to protect patients during surgery.  That said, we are required to wear surgical masks even at our desks even though the rules applied to production are completely ignored by management because they know it's bullshit and they only do it to comply with the asshole Governor's idiotic executive order.  Masks are put on and off repeatedly throughout the day, they are re-used, and they are not disposed of with the regular garbage, none of which is allowed in the processing areas.  Everyone knows it's a joke, but the company is too cowardly to push back on it because the lawyers and bean counters run everything.</p>

        <p>Typically in heavier general industry and construction all the OSHA standards you cited are followed very closely. I cannot imagine however that any office setting would know or following the standards like we do. The other caveat is the term "tight fitting respirator". This precludes the blue surgical masks because they cannot be fit tested as the dont create a seal, leaving the N95 and similar to make your point, which i totally agree with you on. If an employer supplies N95s or similar then they have to fit test and have a medical questionnaire on file for every employee the require to where a respirator. If they don't they are breaking the law.- (im a safety manager)</p>

        <p>Under Guidance click on control and prevention. First bullet. 
Wear cloth face coverings, at a minimum, at all times when around coworkers or the general public. If a respirator, such as an N95 respirator or better, is needed for conducting work activities, then that respirator should be used, and the worker should use their cloth face covering when they are not using the respirator (such as during breaks or while commuting).</p>

        <p>The "masks" are NOT respirators nor even dust masks. OSHA might be why Fauci is specifically saying to not wear N-95s. </p>
<p>I used this  exact thing back in the early days of this insanity when my employer said we all had to wear masks at all times. Surprise, surprise! No facility at the time were open to even do fit testing, even if my idiot employer were willing to pay. Which I would have failed anyway, having a beard.Then they said I'd need to shave. I then countered with religious exemption. (Big thank you to those US military that paved the way on that, so I had precident if the US Army couldn't order me to shave, neither could a property management company!</p>

        <p>&rt; Facemask—A loose-fitting, disposable device that creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants
in the immediate environment. Facemasks may be labeled as surgical, laser, isolation, dental, or medical procedure masks and are cleared by
the FDA for marketing. They may come with or without a face shield. Facemasks do not seal tightly to the wearer’s face, do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection from inhaling smaller airborne particles, and are not considered respiratory protection.</p>
<p>&rt; Respirator—A device worn over the nose and mouth to protect the wearer from hazardous materials in the breathing zone. Respirators must be certified by NIOSH for the purpose for which they are used.</p>
<p>Notice how the two are defined in different places? It’s almost as if you’re full of shit and not reading the things you link. If you’re this persuaded that your rights are being violated, go get a lawyer and sue you twat. I’d love to see that</p>
