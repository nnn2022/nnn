    <strong>To reference Frederick Douglass: It's better to die of covid as a free man, than to live under yoke covid restrictions.</strong>
    <p><p>In no other period in American history would the titans of American Historical greatness have taken these governmental measures lying down. </p>
<p>The fact that we have let our government tyrannize us as they have is a dishonor to our brave founders who laid everything on the line to found this country in the first place.</p>
<p>If so many of us are willing to stand idly by and let this happen unanswered- then maybe we deserve to see the very DNA our country degenerated into what it is becoming: sniveling, bootlicking, entitled, and lazy.</p></p>

        <p>Hey there, I saw this post and was confused - your reference to Frederick Douglass isn't quite correct. The original quote that supposedly inspired you that I found would be "It's better to die free, than live as a slave."</p>
<p>The confusion here is that wearing a mask and not breathing down on someone's neck with your fat, slobbery, and filthy mouth while maintaining basic social distancing is not quite the same as literal fucking slavery.</p>

        <p>Oh, shut up.</p>
<p>Did you give a single fuck in 2019 when people went to the grocery store with no masks on? No?</p>
<p>Then stop pretending to give a fuck now.</p>

        <p>I gave less fucks because people were still getting adjusted to the new guidelines. But it has been more than a year and you still have not started to understand the point of masks, the entire point of the   quarantines and social distancing.</p>
<p>I especially give a fuck now because we are <em>still</em> in a pandemic. People are <em>still</em> dying. And we are past the time that you can claim to be "adjusting" to the new "oppressive" rules. It's a mask over your mouth and nose. How bad can that be?</p>

        <p>Not confused. I called it a reference because that is what it is, I'm parroting the old quote and applying it to a modern day situation. I'm not saying that its (as you say) "literal fucking slavery". You, however are putting that out there in order to make me look outrageous as possible, and yourself look superior by comparison. </p>
<p>Please note that while you quite quickly degenerated into insults in your comment, I'm choosing not too. Because although I may disagree with you, I can still respect you. I made no assumptions about your physique or hygiene, nor general assumptions of you as a person.</p>
<p>And unlike subs like r/coronavirus you are allowed to disagree here without getting banned! </p>
<p>I hope the rest of your day goes well.</p>
