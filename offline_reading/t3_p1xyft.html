    <strong>This is NOT about Republican vs. Democrat.</strong>
    <p><p>I strongly advise we steer away of the red vs. blue,  Trump vs. Biden, Confederate vs. Yankee trends in the fight against the New Normal.   This will only alienate people with 'liberal' leanings from joining the fight against this oppression.    You can be sure there are many in that camp who are not happy with the New Normal and who don't want to be ruled by the medical tyranny of forced masking, lockdowns and booster shots every 6 months.</p>
<p>Rich vs. poor is more accurate.</p>
<p>Corruption vs. humanitarianism is much closer to the mark.</p></p>

        <p>I get where you're going with this but speaking as someone who used to vote Democratic I have to say...</p>
<p>This party left us. They didn't just leave us, go back in time and look more closely They were never with us. It was never a progressive party. It always represented corporations and left us with nothing but excuses about why they couldn't do <strong>anything they promised</strong>. </p>
<p>For decades I endured weak so-called liberals say, "Sorry, we can't do it. The Republicans won't let us."</p>
<p>Truth is, they never had any intention of doing what they promised... And proof of that? They have all three now - Executive Branch, Senate, and House...</p>
<p>And what do we get?  Sweeping changes to fix the fact that half this country is one health problem away from bankruptcy and one paycheck away from homelessness? </p>
<p>Nothing. Nothing but more lockdowns. More masks. More coercive vaccination policies. More censorship. </p>
<p>That's all they have. They could do anything, but they choose to do that, and only that.</p>
<p>I feel like I am justified in responding this way as an ex-Democrat. We need to be done with that party. Do we want to rally behind a 3rd party that doesn't include ANY of these career politicians? (Including Bernie Sanders who turned out to be the biggest fake-progressive of all.) Fine, let's do that!</p>
<p>But not the Democratic party. No. Just no.</p>
<p>What they have done to this country is treasonous at this point... And as more side effects come out about the vaccines they are literally forcing on people, while simultaneously they silence people from talking about these side effects and deaths... While simultaneously they do NOTHING for the families crushed by medical debt or who have lost income from a dead husband who didn't want the vaccine but took it any way to keep his job all to end up with a heart attack and dead shortly after?</p>
<p>This has happened to THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of people --- and serious injury to hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>But that party is coordinating with Big Tech to silence people.</p>
<p>I get your intent. You want to be open and welcoming to new people. But you have to realize this Democrat party isn't what you think it was.</p>
<p><strong>I mean... look what they've done to this country.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Look what they've done to the children.</strong></p>
<p>Democrats? <strong>NEVER AGAIN.</strong></p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>-An Ex Democrat</p>

        <p>Personally I think the entire political system is in need of serious overhaul.    The people are not being heard because lobbying gets big pharma/big tech/big oil, what it wants.    </p>
<p>Ultimately many of these politicians, be they red or blue are just puppets on strings being pulled by these big money power moguls.   I'm pretty sure an honest assessment would show a lot of evil was spawned on the red side as well.    So really boiling it down it's closer to rich vs. poor.    Although it's hard not to agree that Biden and this current administration are working for the wrong side and they look pretty ugly about now, no doubt.</p>
<p>To put it another way, the more we put aside our differences and work progressively together, the sooner we will reach the other side of this mess and be in a better place.   Alienating people because they have democratic leanings is letting progress get caught up in a political mistake.</p>

        <p>There may be a few more republicans who vote independently from their party, but the gop and dems are just two sides of the same coin designed to keep the common folk divided.  The GOP hasn't really done anything for their base either, but they always talk a good game, same as Dems.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I've joined up with Reopen San Diego and I'm showing up at their events now. They do media advocacy, personal relationships with business to change their minds about segregation, and non-violent protests. Next up we're at the San Diego Board of Supervisors meeting. We have media backing from a local station on this one so I think the turnout might be big.</p>

        <p>Yeah if you deny how politicized it is you really miss the point. I live in FL and it's the liberal dems that are insisting on masks in schools. The same ones were crying about removing restrictions 10 months ago and how it would lead to mass deaths. I'm convinced it comes down from the DNC on down--- there simply no way anyone could honestly look at the data and come to these conclusions. </p>
<p>Which is not to say the republicans are good, but they've had a much better track record on new normal type garbage, generally speaking.</p>

        <p>Then where are they? They aren't protesting. They aren't saying anything. Most are already vaccinated. They've all complied already without question.</p>
<p>Why are blue states all on board with heavy restrictions and mandates? Why are they cheering on companies that mandate the vaccine for employees? Which Democrat governor has fought against mandates? </p>
<p>If you think its the MSM, lets look at social media. Look at Reddit, which is largely liberal-slanted these days. Everyone wants this sub banned! And if you even bring up any negativity towards the vaccines or masks, they will downvote you, accuse you of "misinformation," and ban you.</p>
<p>The left wing has picked their side. They are with the elites, the rich, big government, and Big Pharma. They are on their side.</p>

        <p>There is no doubt that the liberal mentality has been tricked (mainly by the MSM) into falling in line with the narrative.    But I think they can be won over.    Superficially it looks like dems are traitors.   Some are, no doubt.    It's the ones that aren't that you have to try to reach out to.</p>

        <p>This is about rural vs city. Every fucking time some shit law or mandate gets passed it's coming from liberal fucking city shitheads. We live out in the country. We want to be left alone and far far away from the shit policies that destroy cities every single time but somehow we get dragged down in the mud with city folk. I've advocated for building a wall around every fucking city and letting them tear each other to pieces.</p>

        <p>Where I live its mostly left and the rest against us "conspiracy theorists" and so on, but since France got their new law, more and more are waking up from all kinds of voting in different directions, to say fuck this shit we don't want it here. But the main narrative is still, question anything and you are an thin foil hat (very anti Trump here) and so on. Big on cancelation narratives and people dont wont to be mocked or cancelated so they just go with the flow and that is to be a good drone and take the wax.  I manage by having had the covid not long ago and just say no I have strong antibodies will wait for now</p>

        <p>Absolutely. I swear many people in NYC are failing to protest solely because they don't want to be associated with right-wingers/Trump supporters, which would be social suicide here. Even though there are people on the left in the movement, the media continues to reinforce the notion that only right-wingers are protesting and the protestors themselves do not help when they bring Trump signs and MAGA hats. I am sure those things might be dandy in red state protests, but that is only going to push people away in Democratic New York City. If we want to win this war, we need to build bridges with the people on he left, not alienate them.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Anyone who thinks this is political (red vs blue/liberal vs conservative) should take a look around the world. Its happening in virtually every country. This has nothing to do with politics other than the politicians are the mouthpieces for the elite sickos they represent. Unfortunately they also control the media and the judicial system. So hoping for any justice legally is a waste of time. Quite simply they've made thier intentions known and unless you want to be taking booster shots every six months and have your vaccine passport be the key to your life, you better join the right side of history.</p>

        <p>Anybody that adheres to any political "Party" is part of the problem.</p>
<p>Political parties are a tool to convince the masses that a certain mindset is the only way to make society work. That's why the US has two... Makes it easier for the corporations/government to divide and conquer. Many other countries have more political parties to placate the masses, but results in entirely nothing but a bunch of squabbling, and they all agree on general policy anyway.</p>
<p>Ditch the party, vote for those that support your best interest in terms of living a free and prosperous, happy life.</p>
<p>Beyond that, ignore anything that goes against that mantra.</p>

Here's a short list of some of the vile things the Democrat party supports: eugenics, forced sterilization,  abortion,  citizen disarmament,  Marxist policies,  forcibly normalizing homosexuality,  forcing people to pretend that a man can become a woman,  affirmative action,  equity(vs equal opportunity), illegal immigration, mass immigration without assimilation,  cognitive personhood, the idea that you are responsible for others health,  lowering education standards, and globalism. That's just for starters.</p>

        <p>Fuck them , im a man first, I voted for some things, they don’t define me ,my mind  can switch based on new information that’s what makes me a man .. you should never limit yourself or identify to much with a group ,or party or affiliation they can always go left or right, it’s your duty to be objective ,and do what you believe in as a man .. that’s the hive mentality that everyone on this sub talks so bad about but it seems to me like u subscribe to it .. interesting 🤔</p>

        <p>I'd be happy if there were NO political parties,  only candidates and their stances on issues. Get rid of that party loyalty and I think things would be much better. Most people don't seem to realize that political parties are private entities that exist to accrue power for the organization,  not to carry out the will of the people.</p>

        <p>It's important to remember that there are a lot more of us than there are of them. They only have what power we allow them to have.  Never forget what went down in 1776, and don't think that there will never be a time where we need to follow in their footsteps.</p>
