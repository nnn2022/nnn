    <strong>Over half of Covid hospitalizations tested positive after admission. Leaked data suggest vast numbers classed as being hospitalized by the virus when they were admitted with other ailments</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/07/26/exclusive-half-covid-hospitalisations-tested-positive-admission/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/07/26/exclusive-half-covid-hospitalisations-tested-positive-admission/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;More than half of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-news-covid-lockdown-rules-changes-self-isolate-app/">Covid hospitalisations</a> are patients who only tested positive after admission, leaked data reveal.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The figures suggest vast numbers are being classed as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/06/28/remorseless-build-up-covid-hospital-patients-simply-hasnt-happened/">hospitalised by Covid</a> when they were admitted with other ailments, with the virus picked up by routine testing.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Crucially, this group does not distinguish between those admitted because of severe illness, later found to be <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/07/16/half-hospitalised-covid-patients-develop-serious-complications/">caused by the virus</a>, and those in hospital for different reasons who might otherwise never have known that they had picked it up.</p></p>

        <p>This is the source of the ridiculous claim here in the U.S. that "99% of the those hospitalized for covid are unvaccinated."</p>
<p>Unvaccinated people and vaccinated people alike are admitted into hospitals for various non-covid related ailments.</p>
<p>The unvaccinated people are tested for covid.</p>
<p>The vaccinated are not.</p>
<p>Those unvaccinated that test positive are now classified as 'covid hospitalizations'.</p>
<p>Those vaccinated that test positive for covid...lol get real, vaccinated people are not tested for covid.</p>

        <p>Vaccinated may be tested if they are actually sick. Of course, hardly anybody actually displays concerning symptoms, if they even have any symptoms at all.</p>
