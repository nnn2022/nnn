    <strong>I'm a walking biohazard and IDGAF</strong>
    <p><p>TRIGGER WARNING.</p>
<p>I live in a medium sized town and build timber homes- mostly rural lake houses.</p>
<p>On an average day, I'll pick up the young guy for the 45 min drive to site- no I don't expect him to wear a mask but I do put one on if I stop for gas or coffee.</p>
<p>I take it off (after touching the door handles, the pump, the debit machine) and throw it on my dashboard. </p>
<p>I've never sanitized my hands after such things, I won't start now. Besides, it contaminates my spits and chew and then I have to smell that shit every time I try to sip my coffee. </p>
<p>There are no utilities on most job sites. No toilets or hand sanitizing stations. <br>
There are cranes, trucks, straps, chainsaws, generators, logs and lots of ice and mud. Grease, chain oil, diesel and mud.</p>
<p>Social distancing is not even remotely a consideration.<br>
Sometimes if I'm trying to talk to an operator, I'm yelling over the machinery 12" from his head.<br>
In timberwork, or any construction, you often need to be close enough to smell a guys breakfast in order to get the job done.  </p>
<p>It's winter. Noses run, people sneeze and cough.<br>
Everyone laughs about the latest covid insanity at lunch. <br>
We share a coffee pot and microwave in a tiny trailer with a propane heater.<br>
If someone borrows my drill, I don't sanitize it when he returns it.<br>
If someone moves my truck I don't demand he wear a mask and gloves.  </p>
<p>More to the point of my story:</p>
<p>It's the end of the day, I am inevitably soaking wet and covered in mud and sawdust.<br>
I've probably washed my hands once or twice in either snow or gasoline, depends on what I got on em.</p>
<p>I often stop at a grocery store or beer store or bank whathaveyou on my way home. <br>
Grab the same disposable mask off the dash and put it on. Pretend to use the hand sanitizer station if I get yelled at walking in. </p>
<p>And I just can't help but marvel at the way everyone is acting. <br>
Following the little colored arrows and bubbles on the floor.<br>
People flatten themselves against the shelves to let you pass. <br>
They nervously move away if you don't stand on your little bubble in line.  </p>
<p>I wear my mask around my chin.<br>
I cough whenever I feel like it. (Into my elbow, as usual)<br>
Sometimes I do it in lineups just to watch the spines stiffen and witness the pure psychological terror of these people.</p>
<p>I don't follow the arrows or stand on the bubbles.</p>
<p>And I wont. I'm alltogether fucking sick of being around infantile humans.<br>
Some of these people have forgotten what it is to be human. </p>
<p>I've worked in -40 and +40 weather. I know what humans are capable of, just as a matter of will.</p>
<p>Humans are powerful. <br>
Be a rebel: start offering your hand to people again. In a professional sense. <br>
You can obey the letter of the law, if not the spirit.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tldr: I practice no Covid-19 safety in my daily life, beyond a mask when absolutely required, and I interact with everything normies do on a daily basis. Call me on it to my face.</p>
<p>Inb4 Redneck. I don't know anyone who has contracted Covid, let alone died. Nobody in my town has died. If I saw bodies piling up, yeah, I'd act differently. I'm not an idiot. I'm a 20 year carpenter. I wear my PPE. Boots, fall gear, ear and eye protection, hard hats and viz vests around equipment. Gloves when required. Because that is rational. 3 masks is psychological torture.</p></p>
