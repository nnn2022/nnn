<p>Been to prison...I see exact parallels how most people are like they have been in prison. Prison is nearly all snitches. You can never trust anybody in there. Plus people act all hard and tough only to submit to the guards because they are AFRAID of going to the HOLE/LOCKDOWN. Been in the hole plus in a prison lockdown. When I mean things can get worse you haven't experience a true lockdown.</p>
<p>Imagine breathing the same air with another person in a 6 x 9 for 47 hours and 50 minutes before you get a shower if you're lucky. No fresh air unless the food tray opens. Breakfast starts at 3 AM good luck getting up for that fresh air and shit food. It's too hot in a cell during summer think over 95F or see your breathe in the winter meaning almost 40F every night. Bundle up in that one blanket you are issued for your entire stay lol. Oh and the guards decide if you are allowed to keep property. The air is so humid that it is like you have to gasp for air if you have respiratory issues or allergies. </p>
<p>People will continue to obey and snitch to the guards despite going thru the stated treatment.</p>
<p>I have always been taught at an early age to never trust your government. I come from a military family too. </p>
<p>The army of Karens are in the Zealot phase wait until all the promises from science and politics fail. People will get back to reality not until they have nearly lost everything to see what has been truly done.</p>

        <p>I have to agree... it is frightening what these people will support and I am seeing more parallels between them and the people who went along with Hitler every single day.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that the Republicans/Conservatives are just as much Fascists in their own way so we are caught between Democrat/Liberal Fascists and Republican/Conservative Fascists... there appears to be no win here.</p>

        <p>There is no red team/blue team.  It's an illusion.  They use it to divide us. I doubt we've had free and fair elections in decades.</p>
<p>For instance, take Bush v. Kerry - both skull and bones guys.  McCain was an obvious rhino. Romney,  I doubt he actually wanted the job.  Trump was just there to get conservatives to buy into the initial lockdown - they'd never do it under Hillary. But, if Daddy Trump says it, it must be ok.  All the elections are rigged.  Ordinary people can't be trusted to choose their own leaders, or so they say...</p>
<p>Congress doesn't even write the bills they vote on.  They're just a rubber stamp for big business and grow their wealth while in office by selling America to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they have us all fighting with each other instead of fighting them.</p>

        <p>Yeah well that's exactly the problem!</p>
<p>We change presidents, we change senators, congressment -- those are just faces of power. The real power is the wealth hidden behind these politicians which rarely changes.  Corporations. Individual with more money than some entire countries, etc...</p>
<p>Most people never look at the trajectory we're on. We go in the same direction, overall, regardless of which party is in power.</p>

        <p>There's no power inherent to wealth. The sycophants are wealthy because the leviathan government can pick winners and losers. None of these companies stand up to government. Youtube just censored punjabi farmers from criticizing their government.</p>

        <p>Well of course the two go together. The kind of person (or entity) who hoards wealth is the kind of person (or entity) who will use that wealth to manipulate government to its own financial advantage, and to the disadvantage of competition.</p>
<p>While it's theoretically possible that the wealthiest people in the world could restrain themselves from using their wealth to control government, it would be contrary to their personality.</p>
<p>Don't be the kind of person that thinks philanthropists do what they do for the good of the world. That's silly. That is marketing hype combined with tax shelters and money laundering.</p>

        <p>We are in a subreddit talking about fascist governments forcing billions of people into world wide poverty, starvation, and all sorts of nonsense for a great reset. We have sycophants in media, science, and corruption at all levels of income, and you want to pretend the tail is wagging the dog.</p>
<p>If we lived in a world without this insanity, there would still be billionaires without a government to corrupt and rig the game. No one hoardes wealth by owning a gigantic company like amazon. Direct you anger where it belongs. Amazon doesn't have the guns and bombs and planes, or the power to shut down the economy. </p>
<p>We are here because a cocophany of sycophants support massive global democide. Keep your eyes on the actual murderers. Without them the billionaires you hate would have to make their money playing by the same rules as everyone else.</p>

        <p>Oh, I see the part you miss.</p>
<p>You're hung up on the word "government." If there was "no government" and multi-billionairres, they would just create the "government."</p>
<p>It would just be their own enforcement. Private police, private military. To enforce agreements and collect debts, etc.</p>
<p>You think the government is the problem, and getting rid of the government would solve the problem... But who funds the elections? Who pays off politicians for laws to be passed?</p>
<p>Removing government doesn't remove the people behind the government. They would just affect us even more directly.</p>

        <p>One more thing. It's not about "hating billionaires."</p>
<p>This is the what, the when, and the why as to what is happening right now. You blame government, I blame concentrated wealth undermining the system and leading us into a global debt bubble which is unraveling now. Either way, THIS is the summation and reality of what the entire last year is about:</p>

        <p>In the UK it's pervasive socially and has over the past couple years been come down on badly by the police. If you say anything that is perceived as offensive by the victim, or a 3rd party (that is the wording of the law) then you can be jailed.</p>

        <p>The people in the comments - I mean it’s not a surprise they spew this crap in every sub they can but it’s bizarre.  It’s so weird.  They really think this could never come back to bite them in the ass... they love this shit.  Man, and we’re the fascists; glad I’ve got the dark sense of humor that can appreciate the irony at least.  </p>
<p>These people terrify me.</p>
