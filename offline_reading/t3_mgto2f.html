<title>College coach suggests to suspend Covid testing so that players who have worked their asses off for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity don’t have to miss out because of some sniffles. Reddit predictably loses their mind.</title>

        <p>Got banned from this sub for posting some wrongthink. The idiocy and fear mongering is beyond laughable. We’re talking about 18-22 year old college athletes here. Not to mention, THE GAMES ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC! Are they going to do 20,000 Covid tests for the people paying upwards of $1000 a ticket to watch? Of course not. But we must protect our vulnerable young athletes in peak physical condition from realizing their lifelong dream.</p>

        <p>Yesterday, after one of the teams (Oregon State) in the Elite 8 lost late yesterday, the team returned to their hotel only to have the NCAA tell them to GTFO, forcing them to get on the plane some 3 hours after losing. Apparently Covid protocols meant that teams that lost had to GTFO, they couldn’t even spend a night in the hotel. </p>
<p>Some asshat was defending the NCAA on this mentioning how they went to great lengths to “safely” hold the tournament because the public insisted on basketball. I got downvoted to hell for suggesting that the virus’ high survival rate meant the basketball season should have never been in question.</p>

        <p>Well most redditor have never worked for anything in their lives — especially something physically challenging, as that would require discipline in getting up from the computer chair. So it’s understandable that they can’t relate.</p>
