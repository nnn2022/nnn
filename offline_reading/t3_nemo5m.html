        <p>PS: I had to take the Fauci Ouchie to keep my job... the ADA and other legal protections only apply to employers with 15 or more employees, and I work for a very small employer. ADA, FMLA, religious exemptions/protection and other protections don't apply to us as they do to a larger business. In other words "Get the jab or lose your job" is perfectly legal-- unfortunately.</p>

        <p>And did anything happen? No. Sorry but I agree with your employer if they want to require the vaccine for their employees they have the right to do so and if you don't like it go get another job</p>

        <p>There are people who cannot take the vaccine for a number of health reasons. Some people, like my cousin and my aunt, had very severe reactions to the first round and a second round could be lethal. ADA protections would not be available for these individuals if they work for a small company like my employer. <strong><em>No one should ever have to face that decision</em></strong>... "do I quit/get fired from my job for refusing the vaccine on the basis of it potentially killing me and be deemed ineligible for even UI benefits based on that refusal to comply with the employer... or do I take the jab and hope that it doesn't kill my ass?" A quit would knock out UI eligibility and any sort of income while looking for a new job. A firing for "cause" (refusal to comply with the employer) would also knock you out. No. No, no, no.  Remember that most of the ADA only covers employers with 15+ people. And yes, it IS legal for employers to bar unvaccinated workers from entering the workplace, and to terminate them if there is no accommodation or alternative, even if the reason for refusal is.. "I don't want to die". <strong><em>NO ONE SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO DIE FOR THEIR JOB.</em></strong></p>

        <p>I am one step away from doing this if my current couple options doing work out the with mesh or other fake mask and getting fired the fun way since I refuse to be injected. I'll sleep soundly knowing that I'm healthy and haven't traded my life for a lifetime of vaccine illness and money I don't make enough of anyways.</p>

        <p>Well, if I was younger and not nagged by some chronic, congenital heath issues that need to be monitored (and the occasional surgery) which means that I have to keep insurance... perhaps my choice would be much different. But since I depend on my health and I need my doctors' care to remain as free of problems caused by my congenital stuff... I have to afford that care. No care means I lose function, which means I am less able to work and get a new job and not be on the dole. When you are homeless, getting a new job is a mighty tall order. I've been there before, 35 years ago, while I was also pregnant AND in the winter, in Illinois. I had enough of that to know that I never want to be homeless again.</p>

        <p>Well, I've been homeless before, and it was not something that I wish to experience again. That's how I know that rapes happen on those streets. I was young, in an abusive marriage, and pregnant. It was because of my now-ex that I was on the street. It's a long story, but suffice to say, it was awful. And if you know ANYTHING about Illinois winters... you can understand that my experience was quite difficult. Trying to stay alive outdoors-- never mind warm-- when the temp is -30 deg. F (-34 deg. C) and the wind chill is closer to -70 F (-57 C) was a massive challenge. It was a very difficult decision to take the jab, but when faced with a veritable Morton's Fork-- I had to go with the lesser of two evils. Not sure if it's really "lesser", but it's the one where I could still preserve what basic living I have rather than risk being in that position again...</p>

        <p>Did you happen to see my username, by chance? Governor Abbott lifted the statewide mask restrictions over a month ago. The wags kept clamoring that "Texas is gonna spike in cases!!" </p>
<p>Guess what happened? Our statewide 7 day rolling case average dropped to less than half the number it was on the day the mask mandate ended and businesses were allowed to operate at full capacity, and continues to fall. Death counts lag new case counts by about 2 weeks, but even those continue to fall.</p>
