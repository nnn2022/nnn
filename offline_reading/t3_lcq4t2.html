    <strong>I finally left an abusive relationship but now feel like the last half of my 20s is being taken away from me</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t wanna get too into detail but I wasted almost the whole first half of my 20s in a relationship that was abusive and also a dead bedroom (very rare sex). I left him this summer, and I’m sure a few of you are going to judge me lol, but I wanted to spend a few years going on dates, meeting people, traveling, and yes, making up for the 4 years I had to literally <em>beg</em> to get sex. I never did that before. </p>
<p>I was so depressed most of the time that I never went anywhere or did anything. On our few vacations we fought all the time. My life was a grey blur. </p>
<p>I finally want to do stuff, but I can’t without restrictions. Traveling is restricted like crazy. I had a few scares with police yelling at me to put my mask on when walking outside, mètres away from anyone. A lot of people don’t want to date or meet up due to covid, or, due to indoor dining being closed, simply want to order girls over to their house straight from dating apps. I’m not cool with that, don’t want to get murdered sorry. </p>
<p>The covid restrictions are more and more getting to me. I was ok with them for a short time, and was even scared about covid myself, but then the restrictions kept going, and I slowly realized that there is no going back to the old normal again. Many of my favorite restaurants are gone forever. It’s even harder to make friends, because in my state everyone is still scared. I realized a while ago how low the death rate is but somehow no one else cares. </p>
<p>I also dislike doctors in general (sorry) because they made me gain weight to the point I was chubby when I was a teenager, when I was recovering from anorexia. Indeed i was underweight and unhealthy, and I could have gained 20 lbs and been fine — that’s the weight I am at now and have been at for several years, and I’m healthy — but they made me gain 20 lbs <em>on top of</em> my healthy weight. This took me to the point where I was chubby. That’s fine for some people, but as someone who’s always been naturally slim, walking around with 20 extra lbs of fat on top of my normal weight was extremely distressing. The fact that it was my body and they were (with plenty of smiles) telling me I had to gain all the way up to the middle of the BMI scale “for safety reasons” — when my healthy, normal, set point has always been on the low end — was violating. It made my ED recovery three times harder. I’m getting echoes of that violation now with all this smiley-face covid “it’s for your own safety” BS. And it’s even worse, because eating disorders have a MUCH higher fatality rate than covid !!! </p>
<p>(I also hate being told what to do due to being ordered around in my past abusive relationship.) </p>
<p>Anyway this is shit and I wanted to put this somewhere where I wouldn’t be torn apart for it like the main rant subforum lol. Also if anyone else has any similar experience feel free to chime in</p></p>
