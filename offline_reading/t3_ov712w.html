        <p>The lid will come off of this eventually and it will be obvious that an effective prophylactic was demonized for...reasons.  Whether people demand Fauci's head or not remains to be seen.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the thing is they arent flat out lying. The stats are there but they are just exagerating and emoting. Long term this is starting to look like a disaster for pharma. They might get  lucky as delta is not very severe and they can claim the vaccines work. But this new mask mandate and the 3rd pfizer dose indicate they are probably worried about ADE. That would really be the end of big pharma as we know it. The herd is with them now but the crowd is fickle</p>

        <p>I hope that is true. But even if it is and we come through and it becomes more apparent that they were lying for profit (Tin foil hat moment: although I also think this a large data gathering exercise for them as mRNA has vast potential) who is going to trust the FDA again? Who is going to trust the government? Who is going to trust big pharma lol? Well some stupid mofo’s will but it will be very clear what kind of world we are living in post this ‘event’ (although it was clear to me before if I’m honest). </p>
<p>I think we are going to be living in something like a hyper crypto corporatistic (not a word yet) world. It will very much be dog eat dog. I used to think communism is coming back (I don’t want it too) but it’s not realistic. Whereas Marx had some great insights as to where capitalism was going and I do believe his predictions will come about. However, Marx was like a machine from what I can gather one of his main flaws was that he didn’t understand human nature very well.</p>

        <p>The more promising any honest study will look, the more likely its results are to be suppressed.  Such info presents an existential threat to authority- though propaganda seems to have furnished a pretty effective firewall against common sense.</p>
