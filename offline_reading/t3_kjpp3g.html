        <p>A woman I occasionally talk to in my local pharmacy told me a few months ago that when this first kicked out, every day she would come home, not allow any of her kids to come near her until she stripped off <em>at the door</em>, put her clothes into a bin bag and into the wash, she got into the bath and <em>shampooed her eyebrows.</em> I mean these people were probably mentally unhinged anyway but dear god.</p>

        <p>Honestly it gave me a good laugh for about a week. Who on gods green earth would think “shit, better wash my eyebrows in case I kill granny.” ???? But just shows how fear mongered people really are.</p>

        <p>I heard stories about people doing this in March when we knew nothing about the virus. I never did because it was crazy then, too. Anybody still doing it is a lost cause.</p>

        <p>I read an article about a month ago where some "journalist" was writing about lockdown burnout.</p>
<p>She went on to describe a woman who had been doing all "the right things" since the beginning of this but was sort of relaxing her rules a little bit so her children could see their grandparents.  </p>
<p>Anyway, during the part of the article where she described "all the right things", she doesn't miss a beat and casually slips in there that the woman even microwaved her morning newspaper everyday to sanitize it.</p>
<p>Like come on, you can't casually slip something like that in there without some follow up questions.  The first of which is "what the fuck?"</p>

        <p>We are all living during the same time period, but for some reason we are not all going through the stages of awakening in the same order. Nobody was more anal about germs than me in Feb of 2020. But like finding out your death is immeinent, there are certain stages one goes through in coming to the realization that this is mostly bullshit.  I'm not sure why the rest of the world is not going through the same stages, and seem to be stuck in the "believe CNN" phase.</p>

        <p>I'll be honest. I did it too when the whole "two weeks" to flatten the curve came out. Looking back, I feel like a moron. Now I wear my ketchup and mustard stained mask with pride.</p>

        <p>Psychology should be the degree anyone thinking of going to college should go for.</p>
<p>These lunatics are going to be screwed up in their heads for the rest of their lives over all this. They were already unhinged. Clearly. But the irrational PTSD they're all going to have after this. The addictions they succumb to to quell their fears. The psychological damage they're done to their kids. Decades worth of 'damage' and new patients by the millions.</p>
<p>There will be entire fields of psychology born from this madness. And not just to deal directly with the idiots. But the analysis of the mass hysteria of it. Following without question, turning on neighbors, the self righteous stances on social media these people live for. </p>
<p>Even once this is over in 4-5 years. You know it's going to last that long. These fools will be pissing and moaning about their problems and fears from this for the rest of our lives. As truly nauseating as that is. If you're 20 right now. If you live to see 80 there will still be people crying about their mental health because of the trauma and fear the think they went through right now.</p>
