    <strong>Anyone Else in Nova Scotia?</strong>
    <p><p>Just looking to hear from others living in NS about the insanity going on here. I get that it's a tough situation and for some reason people here beg for their Government to turn it into a police state, but personally I have lost all confidence in the Gov here and especially the Chief Medical Officer. This guy literally talks out of his ass each week, moving the goal posts, just a bit longer, oh well now it looks like we'll need to extend everything so we "might" have a less restrictive summer, gtf out of here. No new approaches, no plan to end the restrictions, just the same shit week after week.</p>
<p>I am very fortunate to be able to work remotely, but I feel terrible for all the small businesses across the province that are being forced into poverty and bankruptcy. It is INSANE to me that they have not launched any legal challenges against this forced closure of their businesses. I am not from NS originally, so perhaps people are just more docile out here, but it really shocks me. The Government offered "support" to the tune of $5,000 which is a complete joke for most businesses, won't even pay a months rent. It really blows my mind people are just so willing to accept this.</p>
<p>Anyways mostly just a vent post but would love to here from others that are based here that feel the same way, we are certainly in the minority it seems.</p></p>

        <p>For what it's worth, it's not much better in Ontario. Our only saving grace is that our population is more diverse in the larger cities and many of the minorities don't trust the government. White middle class anglophones tend to be the most government-worshipping bootlickers alive.</p>

        <p>That's a good point. I am from ON originally and despite being white, middle class and anglophone it's always shocked me how people just do what the Gov wants and even beg them to manage their lives. Think you are right though that the diversity in the bigger cities helps mitigate the totalitarianism since a lot of the people the immigrated come from countries with openly corrupt/terrible Governments and have a healthy skepticism.</p>

        <p>all  you have to know is that there were tons of studies that came up pre-covid that said masks dont work, then after the virus came over suddenly google de ranked those results and replaced them with studies that were looking for the correct results.</p>
<p>they did a study last year in denmark or one of those countries and found no difference in infection rate between people who wore them regularly and people who never wore them...</p>

        <p>Another thing I wanna add regarding small businesses here is that it's practical impossible for them to stand up for themselves against the lockdown because people in this province especially those Halifax Reddit losers will go absolutely crazy on them. They'll all start giving bad reviews of the business, messaging them threats, blaming them for more cases. It's disgusting.</p>

        <p>While I think you are right Speed, what's the alternative, just go broke?  At some point it's worth the fight, or at least I would think it is. They need to band together and pool funds to hire a legal team. That's my outside view as someone without skin in the game, but I guarantee you if they were forcing me out of business I wouldn't be turning over.</p>
<p>And yes agreed, it's disgusting how people are being treated, the hive mind mentality is out of control.</p>

        <p>I am here and been in and out of the province for 30 years. </p>
<p>It's what happens when the government becomes too big: spend more money on less services.</p>
<p>So much of the province relies on government salaries or handouts that it cripples private business and in response, folks blame private business. </p>
<p>Nothing new here. Private company after private company closes here and you get folks cheering about it in r/halifax and r/novascotia. A factory employing 250 in Truro closed and moved to Georgia because they couldn't afford the taxes and the folks say this shows we have human rights...</p>
<p>But, despite the social media crew, no one really cares and it is kind of funny to hear the CDC say that you can take off masks outdoors in the US, since we live in a compliant province and no one wears one outdoors here.</p>

        <p>Scott Brison oversaw a contract of a few billion dollars for the government to Irving under the assumption that Irving would hire hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Brison was given a seat on Irving's board which comes with an annual stipend of double the average Nova Scotian's private sector annual salary for attending a zoom meeting once a year for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Irving fires the entire shipbuilding department and rehired them at lower wages and said: abracadabra, hundreds of hired people. Last I checked, no boats had been delivered. Some questions arose about Scott Brison being giving a seat on the board of Irving, but he retired from politics and got a senior position with Bank of Montreal after never having any banking experience. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a small organic food vendor in Halifax is telling the employees that if they unionize, the shop won't be able to survive. Queue huge public outrage at "the man" (and by "the man" I think the owner is a woman).</p>

Currently living in HRM, also not originally from here. This place is maddening to me but other provinces aren’t much better. This is definitely a Canada problem right now and all this talk about Vaccine Passports is scaring the crap out of me. I don’t want to be trapped here forever, but I don’t know what to do.</p>

        <p>Definitely a Canada problem for sure. Yeah the vaccine passports is a whole other issue that's also nuts and immoral. The crazy thing is that people don't even realize that the vaccines DON'T give you immunity to catching or spreading Covid. All they trialed was if it reduced symptoms/hospitalizations and fatalities. It's really infuriating to see Dr. Strang say they provide immunity on live TV when this has not been proven. I am all for people making their own choices, but they should be informed without censorship.</p>

        <p>It is very discouraging 😞
I’m just grateful my immediate family and my partner are all on the same page when it comes to all this. I’m pretty much just keeping to myself as much as possible and don’t engage in any COVID/Vaccine conversations at work.</p>

        <p>I'm here and this place enrages me. I can't fucking believe the insane amount of cowards here that are constantly begging for more restrictions. This place is already fucking hell considering they've implemented this regional lockdown crap, can't leave HRM without the risk of the damn RCMP giving you a ticket if they find out. </p>
<p>People here took they're hero's, constantly rating out neighbors if they have too many people over, calling the police if they think somebody from out of area is here. It's absolutely disgusting how majority of these Nova Scotians seem to treat people with out of province plates. </p>
<p>I'm embarrassed to be living in Nova Scotia. A part of me is pretty happy the cases have risen so much because I'm so sick of these fucking idiots always saying how the world should look at us for a great example of handling the pandemic and how the rest of Canada is probably jealous of us. Well I can't see my fucking family outside of this province without taking a ridiculous amount of time off work to take into consideration the crazy quarantine period upon return. </p>
<p>Maybe if we get enough cases we can join the rest of Canada, but then again I don't think our fucking politicians and health people would ever let that happen.</p>

        <p>There was a small one the other weekend, which resulted in the majority of people calling for them to be imprisoned. Whether or not you agree with a protest, our rights are not negotiable, we either have them or we don't - they don't simply disappear because people don't agree with what's being done.</p>
