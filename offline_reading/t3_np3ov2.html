    <strong>The Elitism and Sophistry of the Technocratic World Are Destroying Our Lives</strong>
    <p><p>I just told a science guy on here, he needed to wake the fuck up.</p>
<p>When he tried to tell me there were "no reports" of women having problems with their periods pertaining to the vaxx. I thought, the entire internet is full of women making reports. Where else are they going to do it? Vaers is backlogged to the max. They live by one conclusion, that the vaxx are good no matter what. </p>
<p>Ordinary people who share their experiences are censored and ignored. I think of the classism and elitism in the technocratic world. People who have their noses so far in the world they don't look at the evidence right in front of them. They can't detect patterns anymore. They are such linear thinkers, they see one tree and not the whole forest. </p>
<p>Their world view of wanting mankind under sociopathic technocratic slavery disgusts me. Ever see the movie AI, that movie creeped me the hell out, well that's the future these types envision, no soul or life, and you see it in their words. This is why ordinary people who post on line to report what has happened to them from the vaxx are simply IGNORED. </p>
<p>They live in their own "reality" and don't really care what is happening. Science has become such an utter joke. Some of it worked, but you know when corporations got the money hand around the throat, they pay them NOT to see reality and they cook the reports to the desired results to bring the cash. I don't trust technocrats, most seem to have no souls and the sociopath levels have to be through the roof. They don't care what happens to people, and when I see all the censorship and things blatantly ignored, that pisses me off.</p></p>

        <p>"Science" in this new world has become an ideological tool as much as religion was used as a tool used to control the masses in the old world. Telling people to believe and trust the science, and not to question it, has zero scientific method for anyone with any inkling of understanding of science. For people whose eyes are open and can see it, it is clearly dogma. Science is the new religion.</p>

        <p>Yeah real science allows questions and dissent and listens to reports and "case studies".[aka all the people reporting horrific outcomes all over] Whatever this shit is, it isn't science. It's paid for corporate outcomes with a bunch of bootlicking lackeys who don't care about truth.</p>

        <p>This new science is about heroes and villains, the heroic doctors and nurses and scientists pit against anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, and all those demonized anti-science monsters that go against their narrative. It is a new story, a new drama that the narrow and materialistic mind has been conditioned to accept. Facts and dissent just get in the way of their story.</p>

        <p>Yes it is a "script". I think they were able to use the "insurrection" [I was horrified by it] and the rest too, to push people falling all over themselves to appear "obedient" to authority. I didn't agree with the insurrection--was scared that day Handmaid's Tale would become a new reality, though so much of it didn't make sense, wondered about that guy like Mr. Buffalo horns acting like he was there for a theatre show and it lined up the left to throw all the "question authority mantras" including questioning big pharma in the trash can.  So everyone who questions the system now is a cONsPIracy tHeOrIst Qanon, and that includes previous Bernie supporers leftists like myself. So you are either a technocratic lover who believes in "SCIENCE" defined by Fauci and other creeps who have had their crimes like monkeying with viruses, even exposed but nothing is done, or a demonized anti-science monster as you say. Divide and Conquer has worked wonderful for them.</p>

        <p>Consider the recent backflop they did concerning the lab leak hypothesis.</p>
<p>We have now just been shown beyond a doubt the Media, Big Tech, government, and our institutions, have all been colluding to keep this information from the public.</p>
<p>They just learned that.  That should have been a lightbulb moment for these people.</p>
<p>Instead, they doubled down and continued to pretend "they knew all along".</p>
<p>It's really sad to watch.  It is political in nature.  They don't want to be proven wrong, and they don't want to confront the reality that because they have been wrong, and arrogantly wrong this entire year, that they put you through abuse for an entire year, and have destroyed so many of the lives of the people around them.</p>
<p>They don't want to take responsibility for their own actions.</p>

        <p>I am astounded that now that the lab leak is known why in the hell are we supposed to trust the accompanying vaxx to go with something they cooked up in a lab? In sane world, this would have all these people removed including Fauci, and no one would get any of the damn vaxxs knowing the virus was "created" for "gain of function". The people who are doubling down, have extremely poor characters and are cowards of the highest order.</p>

        <p>I'm astounded they are all pretending like they knew all along, and have absolutely no shame in that.</p>
<p>I feel like the vaccine side effects will be like that.  Six months down the road when people are still complaining of fatigue and brain fog they'll say, "yeah, well you always knew there would be side effects".</p>

        <p>Here's one thing that scares me...how they all defend the system even after being made sick and having their health destroyed. One isn't even seeing the natural anger that should arise from that. I especially wonder about young men who seem to have no verve or energy or even instincts of self preservation and find myself disturbed.</p>

        <p>This was probably one of the best reads describing the origin and parallels of many of the current problems floating around, gumming up the world right now. It's a bit long, but worth it to understand, at least in basic (if not crude) terms, why the inmates seem to be running the asylum.  </p>

        <p>Interesting article...</p>
<p>"Given the fact that they are the tool of manipulative people who exhibit high thirst for power and linguistic savvy, pseudo-realists tend to target the (bourgeois) upper-middle class whose livelihoods depend most upon their credentialing and acceptance by a group of peers, particularly the highly educated, though not most brilliant, among them. An abnormally high proportion of such individuals are employed in education, media, politics, and especially academia."</p>
<p>I've noticed a class difference in the Covid disciples especially the most vaccine loving ones....upper middle class, especially whites are following the Covid narrative without hesitation. I'm poorer--[range from working class to the poverty level above homelessness--lived in boarding houses in my 20s/disability doesn't bring the cash] and I can tell my outlook on life is completely different. I see people ignoring even absolute reality, embracing a system. I suppose if the system serves them, they will have more loyalty to it. Does that make sense.</p>
<p>I think we are realizing the limitations of all the PEER-REVIEWED bullshit, you get group think. One thing they do weed out independent thinkers in all those areas far more now too.</p>

        <p>Absolutely makes sense.  </p>
<p>This author was part of a group that hoaxed a number of peer-review systems, got a portion of Hitler's Mein Kampf published (or at least approved) just by replacing "jew" with "white male" or some simple gibberish like that to appeal to the demographic the journal was attuned to. Although he is purported to be 'a buffoon' on twitter, he has been the most accurate and articulate in depicting the problem we are facing with the catastrophe of post-post-modernism and the potential failures of the academic system. I wouldn't have even noticed him except I was on the tail end of reading Marcuse, Adorno, Foucault, etc. He summarized my worries about the inevitable outcomes of forging full-steam ahead with the concepts these authors put forth. They were writing from another time, for another purpose, and we have to reconstitute our own assessment of reality instead of drawing solely from theories of the past. We need perennial independent thought.  </p>
<p>The peer-review system is flawed insofar as it cannot be <em>non</em>-peer-reviewed by those who fall outside of the review system. The reviewers are essentially in their own echo-chamber, as are all of us, except with the insular intersection of being typically: wealthy, educated, affluent, socialites, and protected nearly totally by the collegiate system. Someone not in that extremely prestigious intersection (poor/minority/disabled/working class/what-have-you) doesn't have a say in building the system that is being imposed upon them from above and also doesn't have any recourse if the system itself is unassailable or is literally censoring opinions that do not jibe with the current ideological talking points of academia. So how is that 'learning' or 'education' and not totalitarianism when they force an unexplained opinion down our throats and punish and alienate you for simply asking any questions? Emergency or not.  </p>
<p>Imagine if you slowly lowered the quality of the peer-review system over long periods of  time, and more people are getting advance degrees which are more and more watered down, but the submission-writers wouldn't notice because they are 'working hard' (and actually don't know if it is good or not until the process is complete) but then are getting bunk, essentially automatic positive feedback to churn them out as degree-holding, leaders of society. Then those with the watered-down degrees begin giving feedback into that system eventually as peer reviewers which allow even worse submissions to be accepted. I'm not saying it <em>is</em> happening, I'm saying <em>how can you tell if it is</em> happening. The social data that I am getting from everyone around me indicate that <em>something</em> like that is happening.  </p>
<p>How do you test the integrity of this system, which is what organizes and educates our society, to make sure that they are not skimping on ground-level societal pacts? It's obvious living near the poverty line, right? And what if all of this is related to the financial incentive brought on by people who are basically 'purchasing' entrance into colleges? If a family paid 6-7 figures to get a person into a college that they wouldn't have been able to test into (think: Lori Loughlin affair, etc.), do you really think that there is going to be a content-based barrier to that person's dissertation being accepted or not? I'm skeptical of that. Anyways, the Sokal-Squared event that this author and his colleagues performed really opened my eyes to the flaws in just 'trusting experts' who aren't willing to reason, out-loud, their thought processes.  </p>
<p>Maybe a little more on track and put a little more succinctly in regards to the current cultural event: why is it the people who are 'not educated properly' about the vaccine or politics or whatever, why is it that the 'country-folk' or the 'backwards political people' are the bad guys if academia has literally no idea how to connect with them? Isn't it academia's sole mission to disseminate information at high, medium and low levels throughout all of society through their own controlled, scientific processes? Something isn't right.  </p>
<p>I really don't think it is that people who don't buy well-meaning propaganda by and large are <em>not convincible</em> but rather that the people who are ostensibly supposed to be smarter and more socially capable than those who are considered 'not convincible' are <em>simply unconvincing or inept in their communications</em>. Seemingly, those in academia and the professional fields are just aghast at the fact that they aren't tactful enough, careful enough or patient enough to connect with the common person. Does that make sense?  </p>
<p>They don't have long term data on these drugs so they can't provide it. If that is what is required then they have to wait to administer it. It is that easy. Plain as day. It is so easy to understand 'hesitancy' that I just simply don't trust these people en masse anymore. Especially with the vicious, unrelenting social and peer pressure along with the lack of clear answers to my questions. I've basically lost all of my friends and have been alienated by half my family because of the shitty public messaging campaign put on by 'the experts' that turned them all away from me as 'unclean' or antivax or whatever, which I'm not (yet). And all because I come to a different conclusion than them about the evidence (or lack thereof) provided. Sorry to vent, really.  </p>
<p>Anyways, sucks to be called a nazi right-wing anti-vaxxer for nearly no reason and abandoned wholesale by everyone in your life because vaccine manufacturers and 'public health' usurped the media to attack you via your social network. So. In my own way, I hear you for sure. I'm surrounded by 'peace-loving' white liberals who all got real vicious when I had a single different idea/position than them. Hell of a year for sure.</p>
