    <strong>Masks are only a short-term solution</strong>
    <p><p>Masks are great at doing a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>stopping airborne particles in their tracks, but only medical masks are really effective at this</li>
<li>maintaining the illusion that you are only safe around others when wearing one</li>
<li>anonymizing people by obscuring their unique, identifying facial features</li>
</ol>
<p>Mainly I'm looking at the first two things; I'm going to try not to make this too rant-y, as much of that is just circlejerking others with the same opinions. But obvs I'm posting here instead of a place like r/Coronavirus so I won't get downvoted to shit, so people can actually see and <em>think</em> about this issue.</p>
<p>Masks were great at the beginning of this pandemic, when there was little understanding of what this virus is––and how deadly––and how people should respond. I'll admit I was scared shitless and my girlfriend at the time had to calm me down because I really did think a significant portion of our population would die from this. The first solution––a reasonable one at the time––was to cover your face with a mask and maintain a social distance of six feet (hereafter MAD––'masks and distancing') because we didn't know what a massive spread of this virus would entail.</p>
<p>But now the virus is fucking everywhere. And we know that this thing has a survival rate of 99.97%. The most affected age range are those 60+ years old––the elderly. (Brief, unavoidable aside: many pro-maskers often use the argument "but you don't want old people to die don't you?!" No I don't, but they're going to die soon anyway. That's why they're called <em>old</em> people.) With literally only a handful of exceptions, nearly every healthy person who gets it not only survives, but barely notices that they got it in the first place. We've now got a better understanding of this virus. It's not going to destroy the human population (although that might reverse a lot of the damage done by climate change... but that's a different conversation). Most of us will be fine. Most of us are fine.</p>
<p>And so our government-mandated MAD is not only a massive overreach of power, it doesn't address how we're going to move past this pandemic and return to an existence free of MAD––and I sure do hope this is the eventual goal of all this MAD. MAD do nothing to strengthen your immune system; however, proper sleep, hydration, time outside, exercise, work-play balance, and nutrition will definitely do the trick (<a href="https://www.wimhofmethod.com/">the dutch athlete and world record-breaker Wim Hof also has some amazing exercises that help as well, that anyone can do)</a>. MAD only covers up symptoms; keeping one's health in tip-top shape solves this problem from the inside-out.</p>
<p>If enforced MAD continues for another year or so, it'll get to the point to where most people feel <em>more</em> comfortable with MAD than without. I don't like the sound of this one bit. I personally don't think masks are uncomfortable during non-physical activity, but I've noticed that my mask, by giving me a relative degree of anonymity in public, closes me off to the rest of the world. This closing-off is already bad w/r/t social media use; masks only exacerbate the issue. People did not evolve to interact with half their face covered; it's totally unnatural. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if this will ever go away. I'm just venting some of my fears if it stays around for another year or two.</p></p>

        <p>A study I saw on masks said that IF they work, they would only work if implemented early on. The study concluded that masks haven't helped anywhere, but we should use them just in case. It also relied on the most doomerish models and was a model itself, so they were really trying to prove their effectiveness, but still failed. I forget which study, saw it linked on here.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/1/236/htm">This paper</a> is really good regarding nutrition and the immune system.  Even though some parts are very technical, I recommend everybody should read it.  One can start developing a good understanding of what's going on with pathogens such as SARS2 from this.  The statistics of the spectrum of outcomes is very much inline with the statistics (especially as found in numerous other papers) as to the lack of healthy nutritional status in the population around the world.</p>
<p>More than anything, this crisis has always been a nutritional crisis, brought to light/made deadly by a virus that's about half the virus the flu is.</p>
<p>The statistics of symptoms and outcomes and such are just measuring the nutritional statuses of people with extra steps, and with misattribution.</p>
