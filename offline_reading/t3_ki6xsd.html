        <p>I want the whole US voting system to change because the 2-party system is baked into the raw mathematics of what we have now. Why can't we have dozens of parties instead? Personally I think that would be a massive step in the right direction - we could end up with something a lot more centrist with a lot of little parties averaging out to something most people could agree on.</p>
<p>But then I've had people tell me in other subreddits that proportional representation leads to plenty of other problems, so maybe it's all just hopeless in the end.</p>

        <p>It would be far better for individual communities to shrug off the federal government and stand on their own. It’s impossible for a government system this large to take care of this many people. They don’t and cannot give a fuck about us. </p>
<p>Without this bloated structure it would be nonsense for political hopefuls in a particular town to say they were running as republican or democrat, because we honestly don’t give a fuck about that shit. We care about the specific issues relative to our own lives and will vote for who is better qualified to address those issues. </p>
<p>Instead of treating politics like a sporting event, we should be more involved in the government of our own areas, speaking at meetings and giving our perspective wherever it is needed. Don’t watch televised debates, debate your local councilmembers and find out if they have your city’s best interests at heart or if they’re using you as a stepping stone in their political career. Uproot the resume-padding types and elect people who are authentic and have a stake in a great future for your region.</p>

        <p>Why do you think we have a two parties? Our electoral system encourages it. You can never get a seat unless you have the most votes in election for a single office. Other countries have tried other systems, but where has that gotten them? Is Sweden's different attitude towards lockdowns a result of a different electoral system? Who's to say.</p>
<p>You hear "ranked choice voting" a lot because that supposedly takes away the "lesser of two evils" problem, but look at all the countries that have it. As far as I can tell, they're typically controlled by a single party the vast majority of the time. It's very difficult for the power balance to shift. That sounds worse to me, that sounds like the communism the left wants.</p>
<p>The two party system actually has an inherent advantage: when one party swings too far one way, "moderates" flock to the other party. Look at American history and you'll see it's actually pretty back and forth as to who controls the white house.</p>
<p>The solution, for any former "Democrats" like myself, is simply that you are a Republican now.</p>
<p>Rather than blaming the two party system, I think we would have much more success if we made lobbying illegal and put term limits on all offices.</p>
