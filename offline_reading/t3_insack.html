    <strong>How are churches responding to covid?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not a churchgoer, but I'm curious about how churches are telling their congregations to react to covid. I've flipped past the religious shows on the radio and I've heard segments like, "masks are our small cross to bear," and that wearing a mask means that you are "walking in the light." </p>
<p>If you go to church, what stance do your priests/pastors/etc. take on covid?</p></p>

        <p>I started going to a new Christian church a few weeks ago. The pastor is very anti mask and preaches on civil disobedience from the pulpit. Strangers hug one another and welcome folks into the flock each week. No masks. Mix of old and young. It’s wonderful.</p>

        <p>Yeah, as I've said before, the Catholic Church went full doomer, pretty much shutting down EVERYTHING until after Easter, probably the first Easter in history when no Masses were celebrated, which is absolutely SHAMEFUL when even in the Bubonic Plague (an actual freaking plague), wars, persecutions, etc. churches didn't shut down across the world.  Depends on your diocese whether Masses are allowed again.  Haven't been back to Mass since before COVID since even though Masses are allowed, it's security theater all over the place in the parishes I've heard of.  Granted, generally the weekly Mass-going population and the average age of priests tends to trend quite a bit older, so in that sense it makes some sort of sense, but even in parishes with a relatively young membership they're instituting all this junk.  I've also stopped watching Masses online and listening to many of my Catholic podcasts because of all the doomer propaganda.  Though I've also said before, the Church LOVES them some authoritarianism, so none of this is in any way surprising.</p>

        <p>I'm catholic and go a latin mass. All of us know the masks are bullshit. We wear them as we enter and leave the church to keep up appearances but rip them off as soon as we get inside, and hug and shake hands etc.</p>
<p>"normie" catholics definitely don't share these beliefs and are all largely cowering in fear - especially boomers. Won't say my location because we've had to deal with enough attempted narcs already.</p>

        <p>I also go to the Latin mass. Almost nobody wears a mask and there are no real regulations. We have more masses on Sunday now just to let people spread out more. But the Bishops in the USA totally bent over and went full doomer, not surprising given the state of the episcopate.</p>

        <p>Ugh, my church is really frustrating me. We have a rather young congregation, and we aren’t even meeting in person yet except for one Sunday a night a month where we meet outside for worship and we have to wear masks. While outside. They have been recording sermons and our small groups will watch them together. They’ve said that we show love to each other by wearing masks and taking precautions. That seemed reasonable at first but after six months it’s getting old. I’m thinking about checking out some other churches.</p>

        <p>My church national organization recommended no in-person services until MAY! </p>
<p>My congregation is doing Zoom only and nobody is allowed in the building. In Illinois, services of 50 people is allowed right now (I think).  If we held church, fewer than 50 would attend. So technically we could do it. I have floated the idea of allowing self selected people to watch the zoom together at church. They are uncomfortable with that. </p>
<p>The choir director just sent an email about rehearsals on zoom. I said I’d only show up in person. </p>
<p>We were losing members for various reasons before the lockdown. We were putting together a growth plan. I’m afraid the church won’t make it through this. I’m really disappointed in the individual responses to the lockdown. It’s a liberal church but I see no compassion for the people affected by the economy.</p>
<p>If there is a global conspiracy to keep people separated from each other, they’ve done a great job! I try not to believe in conspiracy theories because it’s too depressing</p>

        <p>Roman Catholic. </p>
<p>I’ve been really disappointed in my diocese’s response to this. We can have in-person Masses now at 25% capacity of the church or 25 people. Some churches require reservations for Mass like it’s a Motel 6, but my church’s priest decided on 25% of capacity because he doesn’t want to turn anyone away. Masks are required and congregational singing is discouraged. Communion is held with social distancing enforced after Mass and you have to leave as soon as you receive. The floor is even marked and pews are blocked off. A group of volunteers sanitizes the church after Mass and hands out masks beforehand. I think our priest doesn’t love this (attendance is about 20% of what it was before COVID I think and he’s specifically said that seeing everyone in masks makes him sad when he leads Mass) but he has to walk the diocese party line. </p>
<p>The bishop is also not allowing our youth ministry director to do anything in person with the kids, even small groups. It has to be virtual so they’re going to CCD (Catholic Sunday school) online for the fall and winter. We also had to cancel our two biggest fundraisers and have special collections to make up the cost. Our priest hates asking for money but he didn’t have much choice when we were going to miss out on $100,000 in funds. </p>
<p>I love our priest but I can’t support the diocese’s shenanigans. So I won’t be back until the restrictions are lifted.</p>

        <p>Went to church this morning, the first day that in-person services were offered since March. </p>
<p>Beside my family there were five people there, including the people running things. </p>
<p>In the before times we averaged 220 people on Sunday. </p>
<p>Depressing, but also it really is time to leave the state. That's absolutely clear. The tech-dominated left coast is a dump now. </p>
<p>I'm in charge of running weekday evening activities for a group of boys. We are in an area where we could be in harmony with the political requirements and still do outdoor activities like throwing a football around or whatever.</p>
<p>But the messaging from local church leadership is that we're going to continue doing online stuff because we don't want anybody to feel left out if they're not comfortable attending. </p>
<p>When I explain that we have boys who were uncomfortable attending since before covid, and ask if that means we are never going to do in person activities again, I'm met with blank stares.</p>

        <p>The church in my town runs the hospital (yay /s) and they were one of the first places to open for in person gatherings and they also had the first casedemic in our town. They encouraged their members to prepare for the apocalypse and stockpile supplies even before this. They never closed their daycare and their school is one of the only ones open in our town. Many parents are putting their kids in private schools here. Other churches have banned singing and have limited capacity or are still closed. I haven't been in one recently to see what they preach about this, but I support everyone's right to practice religion in any nonviolent manner.</p>

        <p>I'm an organist/pianist at a UCC in the NY Metro area.  Two co-pastors  (one of whom works in healthcare during the week), and a collectively quite elderly congregation that is still by and large afraid of the big bad virus.  We're still remote.  One of the pastors does Zoom services, the other videotapes services in the sanctuary, alone, during the week and sends a youtube link out on Saturday night.  The one who pre-records doesn't seem interested in having me record, she just uses her CDs, so my pay is cut in half.</p>
<p>I subbed at my buddy's Episcopal church a couple weekends ago when he was on vacation, also in the NY Metro area.  They have returned to in-person service, but it looks nothing like a church service as you imagine it.  Limitations on how many people are allowed in the sanctuary, no processional or recessional (everybody is already on the altar at the beginning of the service), masks required, no bibles in the pews (the day's scriptures are printed in the bulletin), no singing, and they had a video camera set up with a bunch of people watching service from home via Zoom.  Communion was weird as fuck too, no bread, and instead of wine they had water (??) in little disposable plastic cups.  People went up one person/one family at a time to receive.  Everyone had to Purell their hands before taking their cup of water.</p>
