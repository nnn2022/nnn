        <p>Posts like this are being done purposely. This is a critical theory double speak trick. They immediately attack you for what they deem is a “selfish” or “unworthy cause” so that when they “assemble” it’s for a “just” or “selfless” reason. Iron Law of Woke Projection. People don’t actually think this. This is being used as a means to demean those who are not on board with the “new normal”.</p>

        <p>I don't care to indulge other's irrational fears. Especially when they risk my life. I am struggling not to die of covid now. Someone else gave it to me. What kind of coward is so terrified of wearing a little mask for a few hours? I don't understand that, it seems like such a ridiculous fear of such a tiny thing.</p>

        <p>Struggling so hard to keep engaging with life. I think you're being sarcastic. If so, your lack of compassion for another human being simply because you disagree with their opinions is just horrible. You don't really 
want individual freedom, you really want to kill those who disagree with you over something as minor as a  fashion accessory. That's the sign of a psychopath.</p>
<p>I'm trying to use my personal experience to show others the reality. Not MSM propaganda, not vague stories  by unknown sources. Everybody says trust your own experience. I am offering mine. At least if I go I can still go out contributing to society, not just a useless burden.</p>

        <p>No one is scared to wear a mask. We’re scared of what the government is doing to individual freedoms in the united states. </p>
<p>Let’s talk about selfish for a moment: What is more selfish than absolutely HAVING to go inside a Target during a pandemic? So, because you JUST HAVE TO, you wear a mask as a false sense of security to buy some useless shit made in china? They have mobile pickup. You don’t have to leave your car. Yet somehow, people saying “well fuck if you’re scared stay home, don’t make us all pretend to be sick because you’re scared” is somehow unreasonable? It’s been a year. Nothing we’ve done has “slowed the spread”. Virus gonna virus. Our narcissism as a species is on full display as our futile attempts to control the uncontrollable, leave us drenched in eggs. </p>
<p>You’re not a serious person. And if life is that scary, I suggest you never leave the house again bud.</p>

<p>I’ve never protested. You’re hallucinating again. Speaking of protests, were the riots over the summer a concern for you as well in terms of community spread? Just checking your ability to be intellectually consistent. </p>
<p>&rt;Key word being unknowing. Unlike the people in this sub, who would willingly cough on someone while having symptoms.</p>

<p>A mask is a false sense of security. People are moving about with symptoms of covid but have been told “MASKS WORK” over and over and think they’re ok to move about. They are not disposing disposable masks after one use. They are not wearing them properly. I’ve never once suggested that you should go to a store while being symptomatic with an illness. Yet another one of your hallucinations.   </p>
<p>&rt;Not you specifically, but that's a general theme with the anti-maskers.</p>
<p>It is not. And if you bothered to meaningfully engage with people past your hallucinations and hyperbole, you’d know that. </p>
<p>We are a year into this. Our attempts to stop this virus have been futile. Lockdown, no lockdown, masks, no masks, none of it matters. Bureaucrats did what Doctors and medical professionals are specifically taught NOT to do in an emergency: knee jerk react because you HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. That’s the opposite of what we should’ve done. And I guarantee you had this not been used as a political tool, we wouldn’t even be talking about it.</p>

        <p>I have been sibject to nothing but ad hominem attacks since i entered this forum. Several people gave told me to just die or that I am too old to deserve to live. Not a single person has responded politely or with any reasons. I came here to learn and share. I tried to be polite.  I wanted to learn why no masks etc. Maybe people were right. But just asking for information was treated with hostility. There seem to be one or two lurkers who are nice,  but what this has taught me is most antimask people are selfish, horrible,uncaring and totally ugnorant because they can't even defend their position. They can't even handle be questioned politely.</p>
<p>What i have concluded is the anti mask brigade are either deranged, psychpaths or just plain horrible humans. If you think you stand any chance of convincing the rest of us you need to lift yourself out of the sewer. Which is good news because the rest becuse your cause is doomed -most of us still have our sense of smell.</p>

        <p>Don't worry. This is my last post in this cesspool. Here's a message to you all. I am proudly Irish in Ireland. If any of you claim to be American-Irish heritage, forget it. The most important quality for the Irish is care for those around us. Sure we moan all the time about nit being able to go to the pub, it's the second church of Ireland. But we all do our bit. If you came here with these attitudes we would turn our backs in disgust that you had lost all Irishness from your soul. And we have. We've thrown Americans out of hotels in the middle of the night for this type of talk. We're proud to make an effort on behalf of others. And I have lived in Germany and Italy. The Germans wouldn't just shun you, they would get pretty aggressive at your lack of compassion and, for them, even worse, your lack of rational thought. So don't claim to be German-American descent, you've lost an essential quality of what makes Germans. And don't claim to be Italian-American because the Italians would regard you with disgust. They wouldn't say anything to your face, but I guarantee they would spit in your food.</p>
<p>The only Europeans I know who would accept your thinking are the worst of the Brits. Congrads you're turning back into the worst of the Imperialists.</p>

        <p>Im sorry people have been rude to you unfortunately that seems pretty common these days. Disagreeing with the majority in any sub almost guarantees a bunch of rude comments. Honestly, I have a few issues with masks.
1. I’ve spent a lot of time in Asia where masks were common long before Covid. Every western dr mocked the mask wearing as useless until very recently. I find it difficult to believe masks secretly worked this whole time and the whole western world didn’t notice till last year.
2. I think some of the mask wearing rules are just absurd. I can go in a restaurant but only need a mask when standing not sitting? How does that work? Would we not be better off with better ventilation and air filtering? 
3. Telling people to wear masks outside seems very silly. Outdoor spread is already rare
4. Disposable masks cause lots of pollution do they really provide enough benefit to make that worth while? 
5. Few actually wear masks like you would at a hospital. They are reused , put on with no hand washing etc. I’d love to see studies about what grows on masks</p>

        <p>How do you know it wasn't a masked person that gave it to you and if it was, would that make you less upset? </p>
<p>Touching your face and fixing your mask, wearing it for more than 2 hours without changing it etc, these things can make your mask pretty much useless. And if you're already infected and don't know it, breathing your own covid breath might increase the viral load in your body and make you sicker. There really isn't any science behind wearing a mask OUTDOORS. </p>
<p>I see what you did there with saying that we are 'afraid' of a small piece of cloth. Why did you use the word afraid? Do you genuinely think someone here is afraid of a mask? That doesn't make any sense. It's not fear that makes some people dislike masks. A lot of us have no choice but to wear them, we're just expressing skepticism.</p>
<p>You're 60 and it's a known fact that after that age covid becomes a bit more dangerous. You choose how much risk you want to take, it's your life after all. But it's a fact that for anyone under 40 the death rate is exactly the same as the flu's and you can't expect a bunch of strangers to give up on their previous lives in order to protect you, especially when there's no end in sight. </p>
<p>I hope you get better. I'm surprised you haven't received the shot yet.</p>

        <p>Actually I do expect others to give up personal liberties to protect others. It is called civilisation. Those who don't are called barbarians. When people do it in wars we call them heros and we all live free because of it. They give up a lot more than unimportant trival consumer luxuries and didn't whine like self indulgent little brats.
You think you got the vote and all that freedom without the sacrifice of strangers. </p>
<p>If you don't want to contribute to your community don't take it's benefits and go live like a susbsistance peasant in the woods. You have that choice. But never have the nerve to call yourself a patriot because your lack of care for your fellow humans makes you unworthy of your birthright.</p>

        <p>Great speech!</p>
<p>Don't forget you're "struggling not to die from a virus", so maybe save some energy for that. It's not wise to waste it all on posts like this.</p>
<p>And when you're totally recovered give it a second thought.</p>
<p>Yes, people payed with their lives for your liberty, and you give it up to get an extra protection from the virus with 99+% survival rate!</p>
<p>And "don't understand" why others don't want to do exactly the same thing?</p>

        <p>I reread this comment and I can’t believe how selfish you sound. You actually expect everyone to bend to your will?  Who the fuck do you think you are?  I don’t believe for one second you stayed home. Your smug, self righteous ass actually believes we should stay home when we are well so you feel safe. How about you stay the fuck home and live in fear over a virus you perceive as deadly when it’s survivable at 99%.  Double and triple mask, wrap yourself in bubble wrap and hide. You will know you’re safe instead of taking your chances going out and risking your life. </p>
<p>If you really stayed home and have only been around masked people you were infected by someone who wears a mask.  I don’t believe you though.</p>

        <p>Exactly, don't care about other's irrational fears.</p>
<p>Start with your own.</p>
<p>We all struggling no to die, life is dangerous, but we learn to deal with it and manage our risks. The chances to survive this virus are 99+%, so asking anyone to do something about it to protect you from it is a paranoia.</p>
<p>Asking anyone to put a ridiculous piece of cloth on the face, which prevents them from breathing normally and make them look like a clown is a weird thing to ask. It has nothing to do with fear, it's just not complying with stupid and unreasonable rules and stand for basic human's decency. Besides, it's not effective. It protects no one from nothing. </p>
<p>The "person" who gave it to you might be the person who was vaccinated and wore 2 masks, it doesn't make any difference.</p>
<p>You don't understand that?</p>
<p>I believe you :)</p>

        <p>The social engineering and brainwashing is on point, you gotta hand it to the media and government for doing such a great job at this.  Notice how the onus is always on you; it's YOUR fault my grandma got sick and died, cause YOU didn't wash your hands and didn't wear a mask.  It's never their fault for taking the proper precautions for someone that was vulnerable.  It's always the fault of some stranger out there, some boogeyman.  The social divisions this has created is staggering.</p>

        <p>I wrote about this kind of thing 6 years ago in my Masters thesis: how cable TV news is an incredibly dangerous new force that's owned by and working in conjunction with both the largest corporations of the world and the government to reinforce, disseminate, and ultimately secure the hegemony said interests want to promote. </p>
<p>I expanded on this to the danger of monopolistic online outlets and how they will create single-stream echo chambers that only support and allow the officially agreed upon narratives said hegemonic forces want to promote and secure, this creating mega-monopolistic oligarchies and creating the illusion of agreement after shutting out all dissenting voices.</p>
<p>I was awarded the Thesis of Distinction but it was a Cassandra Truth I've been watching unfolding in real-time over the past year.</p>

        <p>I feel like people are actually lying when they go off about all the covid deaths they’ve encountered. </p>
<p>I just don’t think its genuine. It feels like all of the most anxious / hypochondriac people I know are the only ones that know someone that died of covid. It’s never a normal person with those stories. </p>
<p>Covid is real, I know plenty of sane people that had it. But they were all fine and the ones that got the vax had a harder time with that. Of course, many people have died <em>with</em> covid, but it’s been over a year and I have yet to know of anyone I’ve ever met actually dying from it. I have a large social network, as I’ve moved around the country a few times. Literally no one I know had a serious case of it. </p>
<p>Posts like this, where people go on about all of the deaths, make me feel like I’m being gaslit. I simply cannot deny my own observations and intuition.</p>
<p>So, I don’t buy it. This person sounds self-centered and dogmatic.  I don’t detect any empathy in their written tone. Like others have said, it is quite possibly a shill, or maybe they’re just stunted.</p>

        <p>Also, it's always the doomers that get sick. I know not one well-adjusted person that got sick "with Covid". I know a lot, including me, that had a mild cold though...</p>
<p>I've been thinking about this: if you're being told for months everyday that there is a deadly disease out there that may or may not kill you but will definitely leave you with long term symptoms, and you really believe that, is there some kind of placebo effect at play that makes you really sick once you get tested positive?</p>

        <p>Please. Just please stop. Did all of you hundreds of thousands of people ALL not know someone close to you who died? How could that be? It killed SO MANY. Hundreds of thousands of people must be lying or heartless. Please stop. 🥺</p>
<p>Edit: /s for the whooshes. </p>
<p>I should have known that this could be taken as not sarcasm... but I thought the bit about hundreds of thousands of people simply lying about their personal experience would tip it off. My bad.</p>

        <p>All of us in years past also likely had someone close to us die when their respiratory infection deepened into pneumonia. That didn't make us mask up, or stop us from attending weddings and going to concerts. </p>
<p>It's time for the truly selfish to avoid society, rather than the other way around.</p>

        <p>That's my point. This was sarcasm. The bit about HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people just lying? </p>
<p>Like seriously, how do these doomers simultaneously believe everyone out there is dying, while seeing so much of the population saying first hand that they don't know anyone who's been affected that way? It's a huge cognitive dissonance now that these protests are getting bigger and bigger.</p>
