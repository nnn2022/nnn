    <strong>Symptoms after vaccination. 100 r/covidvaccinated experiences</strong>
    <p><p>I had noticed that r/covidvaccinated had so many people complaining about what seemed to be heart symptoms so I decided to take a batch of 100 user experiences and tried to extract symptoms experienced with a focus on heart related stuff.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the user experiences, 1 user for each line.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/8FOQlLy">https://imgur.com/a/8FOQlLy</a></p>
<p>About 20% of users reported symptoms related to the heart in my sample.</p>
<p>The UK has now accepted that myocarditis(inflammation of the heart) is  a very rare side effect of mRNA vaccines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9765259/British-health-chiefs-sneak-warnings-Pfizer-Modernas-Covid-vaccines.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9765259/British-health-chiefs-sneak-warnings-Pfizer-Modernas-Covid-vaccines.html</a></p>
<p>The symptoms of heart inflammation are:</p>
<p>&rt;The most common symptoms of the condition include chest pain, a fever, a fast heartbeat, tiredness and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Sounds similar to many experiences on r/covidvaccinated. Makes you wonder if these adverse reactions are really that rare. Almost every day there is  at least another new poor soul complaining about chest pains or other heart symptoms.</p>
<p>The latest post just 5 hours old:</p>

<p>Before someone says it's not reliable data. It's not intended to be a  study but it does highlight how often people reported symptoms related to the heart.</p></p>
