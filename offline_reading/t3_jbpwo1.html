    <strong>How about some Levity?</strong>
    <p><p>Remember the smuggie hand wringers and Doomers predicting the horrible toll this would take on the 'rural areas'?  When they really meant it would tickle them to death for those of us clinging to our guns and bibles to die off... And yet here we are.  And we're leading the charge on living our lives with no new normal... because for us, nothing. has. changed.</p>
<p>Enjoy.  </p>

<p>Articles keep being published about rural living people and their general refusal to conform to society rules regarding Covid 19.</p>
<p>Well, I see your Rona Risk and I raise you our lifestyle and our livelihoods.</p>
<p>Plenty of us have close calls every year, closer calls than any Rona. We drive hundreds of miles, at 80 mph, just to a job site and back. We get on young horses that are actually reincarnated WWII kamikaze pilots and go “cruise around” the warmup pen at a roping or a rodeo, “because he’s gotta learn someway”. We walk across grain bins, climb windmill towers, we run heavy equipment without formal training, and we loophole CDL licensing laws when we’re 16 years old.</p>
<p>We carry firearms on our personage that may or may not be registered, and all of us have looked in the mirror and asked what would happen if ourselves or someone else was under violent threat. We run through border towns and walk on foot through hot zones the Border Patrol is working, because the pipeline is under construction and that’s our job. There’s us that go out in -50 because the livestock needs fed, and we who go out in +115 because the livestock need fed. We sit out on a drilling pad alone for 16 hours to watch the flare and take care of the pumps.</p>
<p>We don’t give a thought to hauling loads of horses or cattle cross country alone, we just get in the truck and go. Have you ever watched a crop dusting plane????? Those guys are insane. We strap up and dangle from helicopters to repair the power lines in Corpus Christi Bay, because it’s too wet for ground equipment. We hunt bears in the Rocky Mountains, with bows and arrows, for fun.<br>
We like our rattlesnake roundups and our Brahman cow roundups (same things really), and we have the odd cousin that raises alligators.</p>
<p>The point is, all of us out here already take risks every day. Whether it’s driving 40 miles across ice and snow highway to the grocery store, or just walking out to the barn to doctor that mean b**** cow’s calf again. Dealing with race horses and stallions of any flavor should be considered and extreme sport. Some people then actually train those things to jump 12 foot water jumps...</p>
<p>We’ve seen those risks, looked them in the eye, sometimes been shaken and shocked when they’ve touched us and our own. But we’ve stood back up, acknowledged those risks, and decided to keep living our life to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>Living life to the best of our ability does not mean this suspended living stuff that is being demanded by people of other walks of life.</p>
<p>I mean, “Have you really actually lived until you’ve almost been killed by an angry bovine, while your friends catcalled you?”</p>
<p>Yes, we know that Covid-19 is real. We know it’s dangerous, but we’re headed outside now, and we signed all disclaimers decades ago. Like I said, we see your Rona, and we raise you our lifestyle and our livelihoods.</p></p>

        <p>It’s kind of like people who live in hurricane prone areas. When a hurricane hit the LA-TX border earlier this year, this one hurricane chaser dude was outside his hotel in 120MPH winds and some local dudes were out there with a beer laughing as they tried to stand upright in the winds. You think those dudes are scared Covid when they laugh in the face of a hurricane? People have a very hard time understanding varying levels of risk tolerance and it’s never been more clear.</p>

        <p>I live in tornado alley.  We prairie dog it several times a year, and sometimes don't even GAF and ride it out on the couch.  Thing is - there's millions of rando ways to die.  Covid is just one more and I accept that and I'm going to keep living my life as I want to live it.</p>

        <p>I'm a trucker for a local company. Travel about 300 to 600 miles a week. Drive in all types of weather around good and bad drivers through construction zones and barricades. I've seen some sh*!. Guess what....I'm still here. One day might not be so lucky, but that's just how it is. I'm fine with it, nothing I could do about it anyway...</p>

        <p>Good to hear!  It takes a little adjusting - like no pizza delivery and you have to stop making lots of small trips 'to town' to get what you need, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I love visiting Dallas, Ft. Worth, Tulsa, and OKC (All are 2 hours from me), but I wouldn't want to live there, or in their suburbs.</p>
