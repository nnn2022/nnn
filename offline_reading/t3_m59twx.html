    <strong>What do you believe about covid?</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, please know this post is in good intent and I am also a part of this community. I just don‚Äôt know what to believe. What is the general consensus here? That the whole virus is fake? Just overreacted? What about the vaccines? </p>
<p>My main confusion is how I remember at the beginning- like January-February 2020 the conspiracy theory was that covid <em>was</em> a big deal, that wuhan was in shambles and the virus was killing everybody and the media was covering it up... but now that‚Äôs supposed to be the truth and the conspiracy theory is the opposite? What do you guys believe? Again, I‚Äôm genuinely a bit uninformed, please know I‚Äôm not trying to be dumb in case so got anything wrong. Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>I believe the virus is real. (had it)
The numbers are way inflated.
The lockdowns, masks and distancing is a joke. 
Vaccines , lockdowns are the real threat.
IMO</p>

        <p>Can I ask you what symptoms you had that differentiated it from the cold or seasonal flu? I'm not necessarily disputing the reality of corona, I'm just saying that if you had symptoms that seemed indistinguishable from the cold or flu, how do you know it wasn't one of those instead?</p>

        <p>The virus is real, but also, really exaggerated. As soon as the panic caused a shortage of toilet paper, the powers that be all over the world saw how they could use the virus to gain control and leverage.  <br>
The lockdowns and other restrictions have caused ten times the damage the virus even thought about doing, and historically, once government gets more powers, they hold onto that very tightly.</p>

        <p>HISTORY! The only history ever mentioned by the corporate media is the 1918 flu pandemic and the 1952 polio epidemic. The fact that virtually all of human history is a recurring story of the concentration and corruption of power, leading to the abuse of the masses by a ruling elite, is never touched upon.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs again only dangerous to old people and those who have weak immune system. Emphasis on older people. Why Canada is allowing only the 90 years or older and soon this week the over 80 years old people take it first is beyond me. If they‚Äôre not in long term care it‚Äôs kind of a waste because a younger adult under 40 and kids need it more because they have more to lose. Older people are only going to live another ten years or so anyway.... so like why waste the vaccine on someone who doesn‚Äôt work and is retired? I am 33 next month. I need it more than they do. I am missing out on wages because I want to be responsible for myself and others... yet this is how I am treated with possible vaccine passport in the future. I might need it because of my metabolic disorder but yeah.... I feel like I am being punished for being responsible and getting that vaccine and it‚Äôs just handed out like free samples at Costco to older people who are probably retired and don‚Äôt need to work!
Grandma killer? No.... how about killing the future of the children and adults! I have at least 30 more years of this life! They only have about twelve at best! Give it to ME first! I would be a better choice! </p>
<p>I feel like I had to rant a bit there.</p>

        <p>The general consensus of the sub is that you should just be able to what you want with your life. If you wanna live inside and wear a mask 24/7, go for it. Just governments shouldn't be implementing incredibly harmful mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns. Stay inside if you're so afraid, and let others live their lives. Politicians and the media are all about fear-mongering, and it's been quite a massive over-reaction.</p>
<p>As far as masks, contrary to doomer thoughts, far from everyone here is blatantly anti-mask. Generally though, again, people believe that you should wear one if you want to, but not force it upon others.</p>
<p>As far as vaccines, there's far less of a consensus. Some are highly skeptical, some are less so. But sometimes doomers conflate any Covid vaccine skepticism posted here with the sub being overall "anti-vaxx", but most people are only skeptical about this particular vaccine. Still, the general feeling is that taking it should obviously be up to the individual.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm highly against all of the governmental restrictions. I believe that masks do work in particular scenarios, but certainly not for the way they're being used to combat this virus. Open up already. I'm not all that worried about the vaccine, but I won't ever be taking it, seeing as I have no reason to, as I'm young and healthy and unafraid of the virus. For me, it all comes down to taking your own personal precautions and letting others do the same.</p>
<p>Side note: I always laugh when doomers come here and shout about how we're "Covid-deniers", when in reality, this sub is founded upon the belief that this virus is, in fact, quite real.</p>

        <p>I believe that it is 100% fake. There is nothing published that actually followed scientific method, that proves that the virus is real. Every published experiment that was done, not a single one had a control group. How can anything be considered legitimate, if the never even attempted to rule everything else out? How that poor excuse for science is accepted is beyond me. </p>
<p>Any diagnosis based on the PCR test, is completely invalid. It is, and never was the purpose of that test to be used for diagnostic purposes. The inventor stated this years ago. If you do enough cycles, everyone would test positive. It doesn‚Äôt show viral load, and sure as hell doesn‚Äôt prove causation. The mere presence of a virus does not prove that it is the cause of a disease called covid 19...especially when they never truly isolated it, and made no attempt to rule other possibilities out. </p>
<p>That‚Äôs like you coming across a dead animal that‚Äôs riddled with maggots, and you saying ‚ÄúThose fuckin flies! They killed another animal!‚Äù Nobody would ever think that, right? Of course not, because that would be fucking absurd. But somehow with covid, that‚Äôs pretty much what they are saying. </p>
<p>Also, the genome was created by a computer program, and is not reliable because of how easily you can skew it one way or by the other. </p>
<p>Total hoax.</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt remember that the original conspiracy was that the virus was a big deal killing everyone in Wuhan. I just recall that China was wielding doors shut to lock in their own people for lockdowns. Oh and that they were killing people trying to spread the word about it!</p>

        <p>I believe it‚Äôs only dangerous to old people and those who have weak immune system. I myself have a metabolic disorder and because of it I have to get flu shots every year because my family was told by doctors to do so. I got sick one year badly as a kid from the flu. So I have to get this experimental garbage. I unfortunately also live with my family mostly because of my disability that affects my muscle strength and balance.  So yeah it‚Äôs uncomfortable to have to risk whatever is in it.... </p>
<p>I think this is a great way if true to bring the new world order. Global singular government.  The masks are just a taste of the conformity you will experience in the future</p>

        <p>The virus is real (I've had it) but its severity is way overblown, and it's being used as a pretext for all kinds of abuse of power by governments, which are in turn corrupt and beholden to tech, pharma and finance companies, which are currently vacuuming up government contract money like pigs at the trough at feeding time. It's kind of like how the Iraq war was started using 9/11 as a flimsy pretext to put in motion things planned for years by neocons with oil and defense contractor connections, except this time the destruction (and opportunity, if you're Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos etc.) is worldwide. The vaccine is being used as another excuse for government tyranny, tech company surveillance of your most intimate personal data, and forced consumption of shoddy pharma products.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know what the conspiracy theory was  in Jan-Feb 2020. I wasn't consuming much news then, and what little I did consume was Democratic primary election news. I only started paying attention to covid19 once San Francisco went into lockdown, and while the virus did scare me for a bit, what the government was doing scared me far more.</p>

        <p>I believe it was a bioweapon they were working on in Wuhan that got out. The Chinese government clearly flipped out over something. </p>
<p>But like all coronaviruses, it quickly mutated into something a lot more tame. What arrived in America is clearly not the same thing that had people dropping on the streets in Wuhan. I believe that this represents an opportunity for government though, who never lets a good crisis go to waste. The disease is real, but the numbers and severity are being grossly exaggerated.</p>

        <p>Don‚Äôt believe people here, this is Reddit. Believe experts, medical doctors, virologists, etc. People with actual educations. Again, unlike the people on this subreddit. </p>
<p>If you want it straight from the source, ask you local doctor. Express your concerns, they‚Äôll explain it to you better than anybody here ever could.</p>
<p>You won‚Äôt find a consensus here because <strong>it‚Äôs a community built on conspiracy theories</strong>, which aren‚Äôt - y‚Äôknow - rational. Hell, they‚Äôll probably delete this comment and ban me in like 5 minutes here. </p>
<p>Main takeaway is this: it‚Äôs ok if you‚Äôre uninformed, but this isn‚Äôt the place for facts, it‚Äôs a place for scared people to make up stuff. Get your opinions from experts.</p>

        <p>With so much mixed information and personal feelings getting mashed up I understand why people are confused. For example: initially we were told to mask up then that masks were bad and then to put them on and double them up. </p>
<p>The point of covid is to scare and confuse the masses. There is literally science and experts on both sides with opposing information. OP was soliciting individual opinions and you've given yours so please accept ours.</p>

        <p>&rt;You won‚Äôt find a consensus here because it‚Äôs a community built on conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>Such as "Stay home if you're so terrified and paranoid"?</p>
<p>&rt;they‚Äôll probably delete this comment and ban me in like 5 minutes here. </p>
<p>Should your post not be removed, at the least? You're being blatantly incendiary and insulting the sub as a whole, while commenting out of the scope of this sub.</p>
<p>&rt;this isn‚Äôt the place for facts, it‚Äôs a place for scared people to make up stuff.</p>
<p>Lol you kidding me? You ventured around the rest of Reddit and social media at all?</p>

        <p>A 'local doctor.' Pfft. I get all my stats from the CDC or Public Health England, science-denier.</p>
<p>Also give the blanket 'conspiracy!!!' label a rest. Everyone knows governments and employers govern and employ. It's not a sin to ask how.</p>

        <p>Ahh yes. The experts can certainly be trusted...I mean it's not like doctors, nurses and dentists deceived the public about cigarettes for around twenty years and were paid to do so. That would be ridiculous! <em>sarcasm meter explodes</em></p>
