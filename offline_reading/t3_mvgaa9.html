    <strong>Hey, looking to have a civil discussion</strong>
    <p><p>I’m what this sub would call a “sheep” as I wear two masks and plan to get the vaccine as soon as I’m eligible. Even when doing sports I wear two masks and gloves just in case. Personally, I don’t understand the viewpoints of this subreddit, and would appreciate if you could reply to this post sharing why you believe in being anti-mask and against vaccinations, especially with all the death counts and how highly infectious this virus is. I know people who have caught it and I know someone who died from it. Again, please try to keep it civil, as I’m simply trying to understand this differing viewpoint.</p></p>

        <p>I was going to be civil but I’m tired of coddling people who need to seek help for their mental health issues. Double masking and wearing gloves <strong>while doing sports</strong> one year into the pandemic isn’t normal. Covid is not a death sentence. You need to see a therapist. </p>
<p>We don’t tell schizophrenics their delusions are real. We don’t tell hypochondriacs that they’re truly sick. I refuse to coddle people who need professional help. I refuse to conform to their mental instability. Honestly not even sure if you’re trolling.</p>

        <p>The primary concern most of us have with how governments have reacted to covid is that is sets up a precedent for the future. Disease happens, and it isn't going to go away, but if we completely shut down society every time a new coronavirus, flu, or otherwise starts we are going to stagnate and collapse as a society. There are several topics at hand that explain why people are here, I'll try to break them down concisely as I can.</p>
<p><strong>Business</strong>
As a result of the lockdowns, tens of thousands of small businesses have had to shut down (hell, three of my favorite small restaurants have closed permanently in my town alone..), and you know who is thriving? Multi-billion dollar corporations. Amazon, McDonalds, Walmart, they have all made a LOT of money during the pandemic, and have left small business owners in the dust because they were legally not allowed to serve. Covid-19 has big the largest wealth transfer from the average Joe to the fat cats in our history. </p>
<p><strong>Personal Liberty</strong>
Most of us here are the "my rights do not end where your concern begins" type. I understand a companies policy of requiring masks to enter the store, and they are well within their rights to do so. No one here is going to say that. What irks many of us is governmental (whether it be state/federal) mandates that all people MUST be wearing masks in public (indoors or outdoors...)</p>
<p><strong>Concern</strong>
Likewise, with the onset of vaccines, many of us are NOT anti-vax, don't let the trolls fool you. Many of us are, however, concerned with the EUA nature of the vaccines being distributed. I am up to date on all of my vaccines, but I will NOT be taking anything for covid until long term data is available. This is my choice, and the instant that mandates start coming out about the vaccine is the minute I'm in the street protesting. </p>
<p>Overall, the way the government has reacted to the virus has been piss poor and an obvious grab for power. Labelling a coronavirus death as caused by covid within 28 days of having it is LUDICROUS. Having people stay indoors, when it has been proven that vitamin-d deficiency and excess body weight are risk factors for covid is LUDICROUS. Forcing children under the age of 13 to wear face masks when they are still developing their social skills is LUDICROUS. I could go on and on about the concerns, and I could give you a 300 page dissertation, but I believe you get the point. A lot of us are just normal people who are simply not okay with having our freedom taken away, with the virus being the rationale.</p>

        <p>Masks have only been shown to work in mechanistic studies, they don’t work when actually put into clinical practice. That’s why the prevailing view for decades has been that they shouldn’t be used during a pandemic. Masks cause increased co2 rebreathing by ~15%, that’s why so many people get headaches wearing them. Two masks is probably more like 30%. Study after study affirms lockdowns don’t reduce mortality, and even an agency of the NZ government has stated the cost in life-years for the lockdowns exceeds the benefit by a factor of 96x. Other studies affirm this, which, again, is why government pandemic strategy plans as recently as the fall of 2019 have stated there shouldn’t be use of blanket lockdowns. General mask use and lockdowns are absent from the accepted four pillars of infection prevention that have been used for decades. We are doing literally everything <em>wrong</em></p>

        <p>It all comes down to individuals making choices for themselves. I am assuming you’re between 14-25. So let’s start there. The chances of you dying from flu is higher than you dying from Covid. Did you have to wear masks for flu? Did you have to lockdown for flu?  No, so the actual rationale for wearing 2 masks is absurd. Now you say we are protecting people, if you actually think a cloth mask or masks will prevent people from catching Covid you are not using logic. The rules are conflicting, I can take a mask off to eat, but I need it as soon as I stand up. The masks are literally just so people feel comfortable and they dehumanize people. Let’s move on to vaccine, this has been done with out any studies on long term effects, if you want to take it take it, I should be able to make my choice. Masking after a vaccine is lunacy, you have about the same chance of getting Covid post vaccine as being struck by lightening. All these laws have no basis in reality. Studies show lockdowns don’t work, masks are ineffective (except properly stored N-95s), and the vaccine is matter of preference. I should by right have the option to do what I want. If you don’t feel comfortable then stay home.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the polite request. I can't speak for anyone else on here, only for me. I don't wear a mask as the overwhelming evidence from almost 100 years of studies say they are at best ineffective and at worst can actually cause respiratory problems (See the latest study from Stanford). I don't wear gloves as it was proven months and months ago that this pathogen does not transmit via fomites (ie. by touch or contact), only via aerosol. An aerosol that is so fine that it will go straight through any mask; surgical, fabric or otherwise. I am not and never have been an "anti-vaxxer", I'm all up to date with everything else I've ever been offered, however, as a late 40's male, who is in no way over weight, exercises regularly and doesn't have any insulin issues; looking at all the available numbers and details about these novel vaccines, with their new, never before tried on humans, technology. Judging by all the figures I can find re deaths from covid v's deaths from the vaccine, potential side effects of the vaccine, etc, it would seem that catching covid is actually the less deadly option of the two for someone in my position (I also have a sneaking suspicion that I had covid in March/April 2020 and all I got were some very, very minor cold symptoms)</p>
<p>I never set out at the start of this to be a contrarian, I just followed the same independent media sources I was already following. These media sources were interviewing experts both from the academic world and the corporate world of viruses and epidemics, people from all over the planet and it all became very clear, very quickly that what the mainstream and politicians, were talking about wasn't always entirely true. So I've just kept on searching for the most qualified and credible people I can find, people using the most credible data sources, people from the world's leading institutions, Nobel prize winners, etc. I have done my utmost to avoid conspiracy type stuff, although I'm fully aware that there is a considerably amount of that about and some of it is no doubt true but I don't want it to muddy my personal waters and I just want to focus on the purely scientific, data driven side of things.</p>
<p>I'm an old punk. I was taught to always question everything, especially authority and the more questions I've had, the more I've found the answers from politicians and the mainstream media were sadly lacking in both truth, honesty and consistency to the available science.</p>

        <p>Thats crazy talk.  You need professional help.   </p>
<p>If you remember,   19 guys from mostly Suadia arabia who were following a cleric in Afghanistan attacked us.  </p>
<p>So we invaded Iraq because they had chemical weapons....  ok chemical weapons are bad,   but are they related to 9/11?   Did we find them?  So either the government lied or was wrong.  Either is ok</p>
<p>Now</p>
<p>The experimental vaccine that has never been in humans before,   no long term safety data,  is a brand new technology.  Is safe.  Since you have no data. You  cant say that.  Can you see the future?</p>
<p>In 20 years will we ask if the government lied or was wrong about this vaccine. </p>
<p>That is my concern. </p>
<p>I have no doubt that in the future this will be the norm but why are we rushing it forward so damn fast ?</p>

        <p>Pre-lockdown, did you walk into parties and ask everybody to stop their conversations so they could explain to you everything they had been talking about? That would be awkward and annoying. Instead, you probably listened to get an idea of what they were talking about. Reading previous posts on this subreddit would be the equivalent to listening at a party.</p>

        <p>I’d rather not inject an unknown substance into my body when the virus is less dangerous than the vaccine itself. Also, they’re trying to cover up anything that goes against what the mainstream media has been pushing so that’s gotta raise some alarm in people. Dissenting opinions are CENSORED. About the masks, efficacy of vaccines, death rates, etc. It’s very suspicious that we can’t even discuss this without being shut down by the government. They don’t care about discussing they’re pushing their ideas down the mass population and hope no one sees through their bs. We don’t know the long term effects of the vaccine either. So you can get it or not get it but it shouldn’t be forced on people in any case.</p>

        <p>most of the answers here are a perfect representation of why people make fun of this sub.
i find a lot of the ‘articles’ posted here interesting (different view points) but mostly this sub is full of angsty teenagers sucking each other’s dicks about how ‘intelligent’ and ‘tough’ they are when entering Walmart without a mask.
there is nothing wrong with trying to understand another point of view. unfortunately most of the answers here aren’t answers at all-just another way for these pathetic internet bullies trying to feel superior. 
you won’t find civil discussion here-just a sad echo chamber. 
it is very entertaining to read though.</p>
