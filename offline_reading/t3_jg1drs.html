        <p>Do not wear a mask and actively avoid businesses that enforce a strict masking policy. Never get tested.  Give false details to track and trace and do not use 'health' apps. Live life as normally as possible. Be respectful but firm when questioned over your refusal to follow measures, know your legal rights and do not be afraid to exercise them eg.  in the UK you have no obligation to give a policeman any details unless you are under arrest, if they touch you that is a assault 
. Politely ask am I under arrest, and when they say no, carry on about your business. Your rights will vary depending on location but in most places these mandates are not enforceable as long as you know where you stand.</p>
<p>If everyone does this, this pandemic will be over in a few weeks.</p>

<p>That does not mean you must proactively wear a mask, and you shouldn’t. </p>

        <p>It is an important first step for the MANY people who are unable/unwilling to just immediately and publicly go against popular opinion, and you are incredibly wrong to dismiss it. </p>
<p>Going from wearing a mask all the time to not wearing a mask at all <em>and</em> standing up for your right to do so is a massive, scary step. Most people, even those who hate masks, will NOT take this step. </p>
<p>But many of those people will take a smaller step such as I’ve suggested. And when they get comfortable with that, they’ll push it a bit further; and so on until they <em>are</em> comfortable going maskless and standing up for themselves. </p>
<p>By discouraging baby steps, you are effectively discouraging people from going through the process <em>most likely</em> to lead them to be willing to take full steps, so to speak. This may suit your moral expectations, but it does nothing in terms of increasing active resistance to masks. Even worse, your all or nothing stance reduces active resistance by telling people not to bother working towards it.</p>

        <p>I agree with you that small steps are the right approach. Yet what does this actually teach the subconscious? That you will be scolded for not obeying.</p>
<p>I don't know if you noticed that most videos showing people not wearing masks display a single person not wearing a mask against a multitude of raging mask wearking lunatics.</p>
<p>Therefore I disagree with you. I say that people should team up to then collectively not wear masks.</p>
<p>To then see:</p>
<ol>
<li>Power is in numbers. If you have people with you siding with you, what is a stupid clerk going to do? Nobody will support him.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have an intimidating look on your face, that helps even more.</p>
<p>Doing it in a group will have a good outcome, doing it alone to then obey just confirms your assumption that it was bad. Like assuming you looked bad today versus being confirmed by another person that you did.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the next topic: how do I find like-minded people?(I wrote in another thread how I only met followers who wouldn't mind "stabbing" my back).</p>

        <p>It seems most of us like minded people are pretty spread out. Good thing we exist and have common sense and I guess spread out, bad thing we can’t get together. </p>
<p>I have not and will not wear a mask. I have been turned a way only one or two places. I walk in they tell me I need a mask and I say no thank you, and I continue to get my items and I’ve never been approached or harassed after that. The places I wasn’t allowed entry was at the entrance and they had security guards. So I’ll say it here MENARDS you can get bent and I’ll never ever shop at your fear mongering, governor ass kissing store again. </p>
<p>Even at the insane asylum that is Costco I told them I can’t wear one and they let me in. I also believe every employee for Costco who took the social justice warrior nonsense to social media should have been docked a weeks pay or fired. When this ends and truths are revealed, heads will roll. Or at least a bunch of people will be sued, and are being sued. </p>
<p>Point is, I wish I could meet and befriend more people who know this is bullshit too. :)</p>

        <p>So, I feel cowardly to this day about telling Costco I can’t because I do tell every where else no or no thank you now. However when this shit first started almost no where would say ok unless it was medical ( and I do actually have medical reason I could use to say this so not complete lie) but I hated using that excuse. Costco was the worse and the lady at the door saw the argument my husband and I got into with three managers the week before the mandate and she told me just tell them you can’t and they won’t give you shit. Honestly I just don’t go to Costco anymore, my husband goes and does the “pretend to wear neck gator” thing.  He never puts its up on his mouth or nose and has yet to have anyone tell him anything but he can also be pretty intimidating looking. </p>
<p>I’m homeschooling our three boys right now so I stay pretty busy but I wish the boys and myself had friends. It’s been pretty tough for them, we haven’t lived in the area long before this happened so it’s really affected the boys making friends. Especially when kids their age in the neighborhood say they aren’t allowed to play with them. Our neighbors across from us have been pretty cool my youngest gets to play with their boys but my other two are too old. </p>
<p>Not sure meetup would help that. :/</p>

        <p>I've stood my ground 3 times. Look, I know you're looking to influence with a crowd but considering the magnitude and success of the brainwashing it will be rather difficult to get that many people to defy these mandates. I don't wear a mask when I shop and if you look at my past post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ivjwj6/kicked_out_of_restaurant_depot_today/">Kicked out of Restaurant Depot Today</a> I told my job I will not return even if it means they have to fire me. I'm done with this sh!t. </p>
<p>There was something that really resonated with me Jillian Micheals said. It's ironic because Jillian Michaels is <em>now</em> a believer in Covid but pre Covid in her work out video she said :</p>
<p><em>"Change is not a future event, it is a present activity</em>. <em>In order to enact change you have to get uncomfortable</em>."</p>
<p>You have to be the change in the world. Resisting this by yourself is uncomfortable but waiting for people to join you will delay that process that much longer. </p>
<p>I live this every damn day. At this point I will physically protect myself if someone takes it too far and my energy, mindset, and body language reflect that. I'm DONE whether there is a group to support me or not I'm DONE!</p>

        <p>Maybe, but I do want to stand my ground and help others. Regardless if I have an “excuse” I wasn’t raised to use it. Also, quite frankly no one needs a reason or excuse to justify the words no I won’t wear one. Like I said, in the beginning it was crazy here and I was guilty of telling them I couldn’t and I still feel ashamed for not just saying no like I do now. </p>
<p>It was eye opening when I started saying no in stead of I can’t and they don’t say a damn word to me. So, maybe if more people start trying this approach and not having the mask ready in case,  we would see this decline in mask wearing. </p>
<p>You’re right I didn’t stand my ground everywhere at first, although I may have a medical reason doesn’t mean I believe they have the right to know that or that I can’t be pissed and want to advocate for other people.</p>

        <p>I disagree.  You state you are exempt or can’t wear one.  Most businesses will back down.  If they are adamant about it then you have to be prepared to leave.  In most places police won’t enforce these unconstitutional mandates that aren’t real laws.   Just ignore random civilians that have loud mouths.</p>

        <p>The only reason I wear a face mask in shops is because I am afraid of being attacked in some way if I don't - I take it off whenever I feel safe to do so, like yesterday I wore it all the way round the supermarket and then took it off between the checkout and the exit door ... and when I was on the tube recently I felt safe to take the mask off because a few others were not wearing them.</p>
<p>I appreciate all of you who are willing to be the role models :)</p>

        <p>I live in a hard lockdown area with a bunch of crazy assholes who are always masked up.  The best I can do is wear a mask only in stores, and it's quite obviously mesh.  I get some dirty looks but no one says shit to me.</p>
