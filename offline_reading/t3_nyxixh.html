    <strong>Anyone (Of Child Bearing Age - Female) Noticing Weird Cycles...Hanging Out with Vaxxed People?</strong>
    <p><p>No jab for me (natural antibodies) but the last 2 cycles of mine have been weird. Shorter overall (32 day typical dropped to 28). Had random spotting during the week post ovulation and all over just a weird vibe. Hung out with a large group of friends — they’ve all been vaxxed and then ended up losing what felt like the week I usually have between cycle end/ovulation beginning. </p>
<p>Do we have a thread on this?! I’ve already got one kid (born 2019) and this makes planning for the 2nd very concerning.</p></p>

        <p>Well Bill Gates has stated publicly that if he is able to "vaccinate" enough people and spread "reproductive health" he can reduce the worlds population.   </p>
<p>Step 1 reduce the worlds population</p>
<p>Step 2 vaccinate/ support women's health</p>
<p>Step 3 *******</p>
<p>Step 4 significantly lower birth rates/population</p>
<p>Something smells off to me....</p>

<p>By the way, google “Dr. Byram Bridle” and you’ll find that he’s warning everyone to stay away from these vaccines. They’re not even vaccines, but more akin to gene therapy. In particular he found that the Pfizer synthetic modRNA lipid nanoparticles that hack our cells to produce the viral spike proteins act as a toxin that pollutes the entire body, and what’s more frightening is that the toxins accumulate mostly in women ovaries, as well as other organs, causing significant damage.</p>

        <p>Posted this on another thread asking the same thing:</p>
<p>I have. Spotting in between periods, and this one came a week early. Mine has always been regular.</p>
<p>While I don’t want the vaccine, I would’ve thought all of the shedding stuff was BS. But it really makes you wonder when it starts happening to you directly.</p>

        <p>And that was what tipped me off. I breastfed my first for 18 months and got my first cycle back after birth at 6 months, and the cycle was still normal. So when this whole thing seemingly went sideways...I was basically Madeline “something is not right!”</p>

        <p>Similar story to you. I breastfed for 3 years, normal period for the past 2, then suddenly after being around lots of vaxed people first (week) late period and also strange neurological symptoms around the same time. Something is up.</p>

        <p>I’m not on any sort of birth control — haven’t been in almost 5 years and this was a first and I initially thought maybe implantation bleeding...but then my cycle started today (2 weeks post ovulation) which is normal but it just doesn’t seem right.</p>

        <p>I've seen plenty of reddit posts about it. However it also could be super early miscarriage. It's not abnormal for an egg to fertilize and even implant but end up not staying implanted and resulting in full blown pregnancy. Of course then you wonder was the missed miscarriage caused by being around vaccinated people or just run off the mill abnormal fertilized egg.....if that makes sense. Unfortunately you won't know at least for a long while bc they won't report on this or study it.</p>

        <p>So I miscarried in January. And I actually also got Covid the same time. So I attributed the miscarriage to that. However, per religiously tracking I wasn’t slated to start a cycle until Wednesday this week. I’m used to maybe 1 day early or a few days late. And even post miscarriage my cycles adjusted right back to typical (for me) Feb/Mar/Apr/May and then this one after hanging out was fucky. But that’s also possible coincidence 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

        <p>My MIL — she got the first vaxx (didn’t tell us) then she went up to WI for her sisters funeral and got Covid from up there and came back down and gave it to all of us. She got the 2nd one too POST Covid too. </p>
<p>And thank you. It was super early (6weeks pregnant) because I’m just so on top of my cycles. It’s something I take into consideration for my personal health always</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry. 🙏🏻😢😔 Two relatives (male &amp; female) of mine dropped by to see my parents, and I happened to drop by the same day (I didn’t know they were there). My dad was out, so only my mom was there. After several hours of reminiscing my relatives left, but I only found out at the end both of them had their first AZ shot. Later that evening I came down with a sore throat, and the next day I had a full blown fever. My whole body felt numb, and I felt nauseous. After a week I was fine (all bodily functions are working in tip top shape). My mom had a lot of tummy cramps, right around the area of her uterus. She had no bleeding or anything, but the cramping really hurt her for about 2 weeks (she’s older and in her menopause years). She’s fine now, but had I know my relatives were planning to visit I would have told them to stay the fuck away for at least a month. I heard that for about a month a vaxxed person will be shedding like crazy.</p>

        <p>Hung with my uncle who got the jab a few days before. Woke up the next day with my period, 3 days early (not that huge of a deal). But the amount of blood was insane. I have never started my period heavy ALWAYS starts light. So much blood that it was similar to my miscarriage several years ago. Then it slowed down went to “normal” and finished on time. Fast forward to this month.... I am a week late!!!! My cycle had always been pretty spot on give or take a couple of days, but never a week. Can’t be pregnant my husband has a vasectomy.</p>

<p>We've lost two pregnancies and had friends all around us losing pregnancies recently. Something is <strong>definitely</strong> going on. I can't say for sure if it's vaxxed people or COVID, but there is no way in hell it's all a coincidence.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my wife is going nowhere near a vaccinated person during our current pregnancy. We're staying right away.</p>

        <p>Yes. My last period was a lot shorter than normal. Nothing too different from the usual I guess as its normally a week of really heavy bleeding where as this was about 3 days. Was kinda surprised and I had just seen some vaccinated people too... But idk. Only had one period since hanging ou wiuth people I guess..?</p>

        <p>Friend of mines coworker got the jab (her parents refused to see her or their grandchild unless she got vaccinated). And she also religiously tracks her cycles (she has a 13 y/o child) and apparently after the 2nd all her cycles have been 3 days long. Screen shots from tracking in Apple Health too.</p>

        <p>My partner didn't get hers at all this month, not even spotting from what I know though she felt as if she did, emotionally and physically. There's not enough stress from work or private life involved at this moment to give a reasonable explanation. At least 2 of her colleagues who work close to her are vaccinated as is her sister with who she was in touch at times.</p>

        <p>I’ve had an extremely normal and regular period for over 5 years, because my birth control regulated it so precisely. End of 2020/early 2021, all of a sudden it was starting a week early and then going for 2-3 weeks, even on the active pills.
No idea why, but I ended up going off my birth control, because my husband had a vasectomy and I’d been wanting to stop it anyway. I haven’t had my period since March, though THAT part I’m not willing to pin on anything other than my hormones being screwy from stopping the birth control. I actually just had bloodwork done on Friday to test my hormones, and get the results Wednesday.</p>
<p>Like I said, I’m not saying my current lack of a period is odd. But I just cannot explain why it suddenly started acting up before I stopped the birth control. I’ve never had that happen before.</p>

        <p>I’m fully aware of what the article is, but you didn’t read past the first line. I’m going to take a study (did you even bother reading it?) of 52k+ people (1300 of which had Covid and did not get vaccinated) from Dec. 2020 until Mar. 2021 as sufficient data. So please, tell me what a “peer review” is going to do? </p>
<p>We don’t tell people who have had chickenpox before to go get the Varicella vaccine, nor do we tell those who have had the measles or mumps to get an MMR. Why would we go inject unnecessary spike proteins into people with natural antibodies? The vaccine eradicates those and as a result you can’t even donate convalescent plasma to people in the hospital with Covid because the vaccine doesn’t work the same way as naturally occurring ones.</p>

        <p>Real science. Yes. 
Trust the “Science.” No. </p>
<p>It seems you’re one who is pinning everyone in this sub “anti-vax” yet you refused to answer any questions I asked regarding vaccines for viruses such as varicella or the measles or mumps. </p>
<p>So either those people who have had those viruses also need to get the vaccines for them or you’re just here to troll.</p>
