    <strong>A relevant quote from CS Lewis...</strong>
    <p><p>"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.” - C.S. Lewis</p></p>

        <p>Here's another timely quote from C.S. Lewis. It applies as much to covid doomers as it ever did to the threat of nuclear war.</p>
<p>&rt;In one way we think a great deal too much of the atomic bomb. “How are we to live in an atomic age?” I am tempted to reply: “Why, as you would have lived in the sixteenth century when the plague visited London almost every year, or as you would have lived in a Viking age when raiders from Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night; or indeed, as you are already living in an age of cancer, an age of syphilis, an age of paralysis, an age of air raids, an age of railway accidents, an age of motor accidents.”
In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented: and quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways. We had, indeed, one very great advantage over our ancestors—anesthetics; but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.
This is the first point to be made: and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things—praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts—not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies but they need not dominate our minds.</p>

        <p>I love using this quote.  Lewis has a pretty squeaky clean background so it's going to be hard to "cancel" him.  He didn't have twitter either so that makes him harder to cancel.</p>

        <p>Much about history and power now makes sense to me after this year. I was naive and thought this sort of insidious power grab and loss of freedom would be more obvious to the population but you can now see how society can get caught up in an unwitting manic psychosis and become Nazi Germany or North Korea. </p>
<p>I'm don't know if I articulated that well but as corny as this sounds, I'm now hyper aware of the importance of family bond, freedom, education, healthy economy, safe streets and general peace.</p>
