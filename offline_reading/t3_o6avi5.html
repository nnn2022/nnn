    <strong>Vaccine is putting a strain on my relationship</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all!
This might be better suited for relationship advice subreddit, but I want to know your opinion, folks.</p>
<p>The recent political situation revealed things about my partner I'm not sure I like.
The situation regarding vaccines, censorship etc scares me. I think its a responsibility of each person to keep themselves informed - from various sources, even the mass media - and form their own view.</p>
<p>My partner is on another side of spectrum. He doesn't really care about any of this. Doesn't read, listen to anything - he says that whats the point, its all fake anyways.
Recently he told me he wants to get vaccinated. I don't have problem with that - all I asked from him to at least attempt to inform himself about it.</p>
<p>I knew he wouldn't search any info by himself - he hates reading and has a short attention span, so wouldn't listen to any interviews or podcasts. </p>
<p>So I've send him some articles and posts - not too many, to avoid overwhelming him. He didn't even look at anything.
He told be on the evening before that the next day hes getting vaccine. </p>
<p>He's reasoning - he doesn't want to be restricted to travel in the future and also - the main argument - EVERYONE else is doing it.</p>
<p>I just can't get pass this. It's not the fact that he did it - ita his body and has a right to decide what's right for him. I cant get over the fact that he just doesn't care - he put ZERO effort on informing himself. </p>
<p>We have a fundamental difference when it comes to this - before i do anything I like to do my research. It comes to every aspect of life. He doesn't really care about anything, just makes decision in a spur of the moment. 
But when it comes to serious decision - like a fact of accepting experimental treatment and following other without any good reason (he's not scared of virus at all) - it bothers me.</p>
<p>Sorry for the lenght of this - I've tried to present situation as clearly as possible.</p>
<p>Am I being crazy? I'm considering ending things between us - not because he got the jab but because of lack of thought behind it.
What do you think?</p></p>

        <p>Imagine believing skepticism is unhealthy.</p>
<p>She's not even saying she's against it, just that she wants him to inform himself. "Everyone else is doing it" is the <em>shittiest</em> excuse you can come up with.</p>
<p>There's a reason your mother should have asked you "If little Timmy jumped off a bridge, would you?"</p>
<p>Skepticism has motivated EVERY great advancement in science throughout history. What if Copernicus wasn't skeptical about the earth being the center of the universe?</p>
<p>That doesn't mean skeptics are always right. Usually, they're not.</p>
<p>But you're also not doing yourself any favors by invoking emotions "think of the poor kids that will easily die if you don't throw your caution to the wind" -- <strong>ALSO KIDS AREN'T AT RISK FROM THE COOF COOF</strong></p>

        <p>By your stupid fucking logic, if you take the polio vaccine you can't get polio correct? If you take the Covid shot you can still get Covid though right? So stop calling it a vaccine you utterly stupid brainwashed fuck. Not many people here are anti vaxx, we're anti experimental mRNA therapies.</p>

        <p>But anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers stance is based on the same premise. They're exercising full bodily autonomy. So it makes no sense to be understanding toward someone who doesn't want this particular shot and someone who doesn't want any. The mental gymnastics you have to make when arguing in favor of the establishment is nothing short of amazing.</p>

        <p>That’s what I’m confused about, I’m seeing articles from yahoo etc saying that the vaccine doesn’t effect sperm counts (I haven’t looked into it myself) and people speculating that it’s women’s ovaries that will primarily be targeted (based off the Japan study on bio distribution). </p>
<p>Could the vaccine cause infertility in women more so than in men? Or to equal amounts?</p>

        <p>I’m glad you’re looking into it, but it’s we the people vs every big corporation and government. You won’t find the truth from the people pushing the vaccines on us. They’re all in on it. Some doctors are coming out saying it’s all shit and they’re on the side of we the people. I know I sound uneducated and conspiratorial but it boils down to that.</p>

<p>Every single person I know that has had the vaccine has used these two arguments.</p>
<p>They think this is a path to "freedom". </p>

        <p>Get out. Seriously, he’s a sheep and such a fundamental difference between two people will inevitably cause major problems. What happens when you have kids and he wants them vaccinated because ‘everyone else is doing it’? Luckily, my wife and I are on the same page (I.e. fuck the vaccine), but if she was like your partner that would be the end of us.</p>

        <p>Thanks everyone for the comments - keep them coming, I'll do my best to reply to each of you when I'm done with work.</p>
<p>I just want to make something clear. If he had done the vaccine because he had a legit reasoning behind it - i don't know, believed that virus is dangerous or we need it for herd immunity, really ANY reason - i think i would be ok with his decision.</p>
<p>Because he's reasoning was "because everyone else is doing it" I have problem with accepting it. It's just so... disappointing. </p>
<p>We couldn't even have a discussion about it, just because he has nothing to say.</p>

        <p>Sorry, I don't know your partner at all obviously, but I would find that such a turn off. Personally for me, an inquisitive and curious mind comes with a little bit of skepticism and truth seeking. Maybe these values are important to you but not so important to him, but it's coming to light over quite a heavy and possibly serious decision.</p>

        <p>His thought process is clearly flawed. His mind has been deeply brainwashed by the various media outlets, so much so he cannot think for himself anymore. Unfortunately he is not alone and the mass of sheep’s are growing rapidly.</p>
<p>You are not crazy,  you have just realised you both have extremely different characteristics. Put it this way, I wouldn’t want someone of that ilk to be in my corner in a battle. We need free thinkers and not zoned out zombies. Take of that what you will. </p>

<p>I'm so sorry. I've had lots of very disappointing people show their true colors in my life this year (15 months) too. I'm looking at it as a blessing, though, because I'd rather know now than spend years wishing they were different than they actually are.</p>

        <p>People that would normally research a couch for months before purchasing are getting the jab because “everyone else is doing it” it’s 24/7 propaganda and brainwashing from MSM, politicians and even the medical/scientific establishment. I wouldn’t be too hard on your partner for falling victim to it. I have seen a lot of otherwise intelligent people do the same. It’s a kind of mass hysteria.

        <p>In the long term, this huge difference in attitudes could cause problems with other big issues which you will have to deal with, so it is certainly worth carefully considering if this person would make a good life partner.</p>
<p>If you ever had children together, you might find that you don't support each other when making important decisions for your children. So it depends what you are looking for in a partner.</p>

I've started noticing that all big decisions and things that require some thinking - like figuring out finances for example - fall on me because he thinks I'm "the smart one" in this relationship.

        <p>&rt; all the big decisions ... fall on me</p>
<p>“For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. He is the Savior of his body, the church.”
‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭5:23‬ ‭NLT‬‬</p>
<p>I don’t know if you’re a Christian or not, but I think the Bible has a wise perspective on marital roles. When the Bible says a wife should “submit” to their husband it doesn’t mean it in a modern sense, but more “accept your husbands leadership” (and it’s the husbands role to also submit to the wife in certain ways and be a careful and loving provider, not a tyrant, just to be clear). It sounds like he’d rather abdicate his responsibility as a man instead of fulfilling the archetypal masculine roles, such as assertive, protective, grounded, leading, brave, stability, support, and strength. </p>
<p>Men and women both have these qualities, but it’s my belief that in a relational context, things flow much more smoothly when the man takes responsibility for masculine things, and the woman takes responsibility for feminine things (and I mean that in a psychological sense, not specifically traditional gender roles). Women tend to be more self sacrificing, caring, gentle, etc, and that’s probably in part because of evolution. But those roles are important, and it sounds like he wants no part in leading you in life. 🚩🚩🚩</p>

        <p>This is the problem feminism has wrought on our society.  I'm not blaming you, we have all been brainwashed with it, male and female for at least 3 generations now. </p>
<p>Boys are feminised in school, shamed for acting like boys and are always 2nd in terms of grades to the girls.  Men grow up castrated.  They have given up. </p>
<p>I'd recommend embracing femininity, traditional gender roles and attracting a masculine man.  It is how we were intended to be, and you will be happy</p>

<p>If he can’t be bothered to put some thought towards what is important to you, then you can expect the apathy to continue and only get worse. </p>
<p>It’s nothing to do with the vaccine like you said, it’s about not contributing to the relationship on the same intellectual level as you. It sounds like that’s very important to you (and should be) and is a deal breaker.</p>

        <p>To be honest,  I would have trouble being with someone who is incapable of informing themselves about anything. Leaving covid out completely,  there are so many things where research is required. I just read a story about a family who bought a house in Ontario where the housing market is very tight. The previous buyer fell through so the realtor contacted the family and said they could have with house with a higher offer and no inspection.  Of course the house has several problems which basically make it uninhabitable. All the "experts" in Ontario are saying housing prices will go up forever so you need to buy now and the realtors are saying only unconditional offers without an inspection condition have a chance of being accepted.  It takes a lot of initiative and strength to go against the conventional wisdom in any circumstance.  Do you want to be the person in the relationship who's doing all the research and all the thinking through of decisions? Do you want to be constantly fighting him over every decision or mitigating the effects of decisions he made on the spur of the moment? The most important financial decision you can make is your choice of partner.  There are so many things that can go wrong if you're not making decisions carefully as a couple.  Covid is an emotional topic (it has been made that way) and most of the world is having trouble thinking about it rationally.  Leave that aside - is this someone you can have a conversation with and work together to come to mutual decisions?</p>

        <p>I totally get you and I have to admit I was in your partner’s shoes at the start of the pandemic. My partner was the first one to warn me that lockdowns were going to happen and we better stock up on shit we needed to buy - I didn’t listen. Here we are a year and a half later.</p>
<p>I also didn’t believe his vaccine stuff at first. I’m very resistant to this kind of information as my mind automatically classifies it as “antivaxxer” bs since that’s what I was conditioned to believe - that anything agains any vaccine is idiotic since these people telling me it’s potentially harmful has “no credibility or titles and is therefore a quack”. </p>
<p>Needless to say this has all changed at this point after painfully going through the readings and keeping a hesitantly open mind. It wasn’t easy and there’s still a part of me that wishes this isn’t true and we’re all going to be fine and dandy by next year. Our differing views put a strain in my relationship as well until I started seeing things for myself. </p>
<p>I did consider breaking up as well, but the more I thought about it this is also part of this whole plan - to drive people apart and create a divide. I would say try to be as patient as possible with your partner if you can. If he’s already taken the jab then he’ll be more likely to be defensive about it. It’s not going to be easy but at least try to get him to hypothetically consider if what you’re saying is true. Find comparisons in topics he would better resonate with (I had a friend who told me he’s not getting the vaccine first in the same way he’s not spending $70 on glitchy, newly released games since he knows it’s always rushed and will be better once it’s been patched). </p>
<p>I hope this helps. I totally feel for you and I hope your relationship survives this if it’s worth it for you.</p>

        <p>I was really scared at the beginning of all of this and firmly believed in lockdown and masks. But we look for info and adjust with what we have learnt right? "Only cows never change their opinions" that's a saying in my country.</p>
<p>When we discussed the vaccine he threw it in my face like an insult - "remember how scared you were at the beginning?" 
I said that I remember, I'm not ashamed of that. Everyone was scared. Now we know more - so we can decide for ourselves...</p>

        <p>I would absolutely not stay with someone who doesn't read and doesn't have a long attention span-- that's indicative of larger issues that aren't going away, and I can't imagine being happy in a relationship with someone like that, personally.  Those things won't get better over time, and this person is just going to drag you down if you DO read and have an attention span.  My experience with relationships is that you get dragged down to the level of the lower-performing person.  I'm just an internet rando, so take this with a huge grain of salt, but I'd be packing my stuff to leave already in that situation.  Being in a relationship with someone who doesn't understand you is lonelier than being single.</p>

        <p>Makes sense!  I don't think curiosity, reading, and attention span is always tied to educational attainment, but it can be.  I just know that the field I'm in takes an insane amount of focus and skill (seamstress/costume designer/textile artist), so being around people with zero attention span, etc drives me up the wall!  I once broke things off with a friend by accident when she wanted to be my apprentice and I told her very, very bluntly that "I had a longer attention span than you do when I was six years old" and she went and acted like a sensitive salad about it and I'm like WTF, I'm not paying you to take selfies for instagram when we have a deadline... ANYWAYS.  I have noticed from "dating down" so to speak that they never, ever get to your level, only pull you down.  One time I dated a guy who only ate fries and I thought he'd pick up my better habits but instead I ended up eating fries and gaining weight.  It's just a downward hill with situations like that.  Like I said, better alone than with someone who drags you down because they can't keep up.</p>

        <p>That's funny because my wife was educated through academia and when she decided to date again she did NOT want someone college educated. I definitely could have gone to uni and my sister is a former English literature professor from Stanford so I'm used to engaging with people with an "education" but I find these people lack common sense, sometimes even more so than your "average Joe".</p>
<p>My sister bought into the covid b.s. Her husband, a physicist, believes some of the propaganda but stops at wearing a mask outside. My point is education sometimes makes you more prone to confirmation bias, at least IMO and more susceptible to MSM brainwashing. </p>
<p>I've always loved reading which is why me and my wife work together. When we met in 2014 she was ready to abandon all that she knew about the world since it was not adding up. I faced no resistance when I discussed controversial conspiratorial subjects, but I also showed her how to verify info using establishment sources since I had been awake since 2006. You learn a lot getting duped over and over. This is what scares the establishment, they don't want you to actually progress and learn on your own, learn how to sift through their lies and come to your OWN conclusions. You need to go through the gatekeepers. I'm sorry about your situation. I would leave but that's me, the decision is ultimately yours. Good luck in whatever you decide.</p>

        <p>That's interesting what you say about academia world and being prone to confirmation bias. My experience with uni wasn't the best - most of professors discouraged critical thinking and the easiest way to pass with best marks was to simply go through motions.</p>
<p>Obtaining first class degree was dead easy - just processing what was already written by other academics. </p>
<p>I found most students lazy and disengaged - nobody really cared about anything.</p>
<p>Perhaps thats what attracted me to my partner - he was from "real world" and working high stress physical job.</p>

        <p>In any relationship communication is key to it being healthy. Maturity in a relationship comes from admitting you are wrong and always being willing to hear the opposite side of the argument even if you still do not agree. </p>
<p>But, if you genuinely do not like the views of the other person that is never going to change and you cannot change somebody else. So you either accept who they are, agree to disagree or both come to an agreement where you both accept the other persons point of view and decisions. Or, you move on. </p>
<p>I am hardcore against this agenda and although I will be really upset when my partner does get the vaccine I know they are in a position that they have no other choice even with my reassurances that they do. So I respect their decision and will support them as they would support me if any harm came to them from that decision. It’s important however that we are both in agreement about our children, which we are as that could change my opinion drastically.</p>

        <p>&rt;I knew he wouldn’t search for info by himself</p>
<p>&rt;”it’s all fake news anyways”</p>
<p>&rt;I sent him a couple articles, he didn’t even bother looking at them. He told me he’s getting the vaccine </p>
<p>&rt;his main argument is “everyone else is doing it”</p>
<p>You seem like an extremely grounded and intelligent person and your partner is an ignorant blockhead that doesn’t even <em>care</em> to hear your thoughts concerning his safety and health.</p>
<p>Not to mention he’s a soyboy follower. “Everyone else is doing it”… Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Imo, just from this post, you’d be WAY better off without him and finding someone who actually has a head on their shoulders and takes the 5 mins out of their day just to hear you out.</p>

        <p>This , he doesn’t value your opinion which should be a red flag . My wife was pressured to get the vax by her doctors because she takes care of 2 elderly people . We talked about it and she ended up getting it ( and had horrible side effects ) and I have not . We have never argued or had any type of disagreement about it , it’s a individual choice , and I respect her decision even though I don’t think it’s a good idea .</p>

        <p>This is such a hard question. On the one hand, people do change: Something may happen in his life that wakes him up, and he may become much more open to new information and ultimately share your world view. But on the other hand, you may find yourself in my situation: Married 20+ years, viewpoints are still worlds apart, and now your differences have major implications, like whether to allow your kids to be vaccinated (our current battle). </p>
<p>All I can say is good luck to you - I hope it works out for the best.</p>

        <p>Dude I'm sorry to hear that. And I'm sorry to say it so bluntly, but anybody who prefers to bask in willful ignorance (he won't read, etc) isn't worth your time. That's, in my opinion, a kind of dangerous stupidity which gets others hurt. </p>
<p>I honestly don't think I could be with someone who had the opposite take on this situation. I wouldn't be able to respect her and it wouldn't be fair to her. </p>
<p>I'm kinda extreme, though. I'm not trying to suggest you uproot your life over this, but you sure have my compassion.</p>

        <p>My wife is vaccinated and kinda did it a lil sneakily but only because she knew how i felt about it(so its on me) but anyway. Its not a prob for us. Neither of us get caught up in the left vs right bs, its a gd virus not political (even tho i believe man made lol). 
  So yes it bothers me of the standpoint that she got wrapped up in the me too type blitz of getting vaccinated and i worry for her safety but other than that i view it as her body, her choice. All u can do. I chose not to. As long as our children arent being pushed into "THIS" vaccine, not all vaccines, we are good. Not gonna ruin all our lives over it.</p>

        <p>I think the most upsetting part is that he isn't being considerate of your concerns. Relationships rely on strong communication. If he can't take you seriously this time, it will likely happen again. Understanding your thoughts should be a higher priority than following the herd. That said, some people just don't care or can't be bothered to search for the truth. Others believe there's nothing they can do about it, so why bother? Ignorance is bliss. Fitting in brings about a false sense of security.</p>

        <p>Gotta agree with most people here and sadly say you might wanna find someone else. I’ve been a skeptic of this world since I was at least 14-15 and I’ve only recently been lucky enough to meet someone who has been skeptical of corona from the start. I would never be with someone that didn’t share my worldview on something as important as this because in the long term it’s gonna be extremely aligned with the way I wanna raise my kids and live out the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Stay out of there if you want to keep your sanity. In addition to that if you are a female %99 of the comments will be "dump him" regardless of what your problem is. Besides that if both of you think there is a future for you, he should at least listen to your opinion before acting alone and not be selfish about it. In a serious relationship both sides are responsible for each others health and well being to some extent IMO. Remind him that if something bad really happens to him you will also be affected by it.</p>

        <p>Some people’s values in life are just incompatible… and we all perceive things differently and have different priorities. Not saying what’s right and wrong but there’s lots of things that people won’t ever agree on. Unfortunately this means considering which values for you are non negotiable and thinking about if a relationship with someone who has such a different core outlook on life is worth it</p>

        <p>Would you have kids with this man?  If so would he put same the lack of due diligence and research into something that may affect them, such as an experimental vaccine? As a parent you have to make decisions for your child and it’s scary to think people would rather follow a mainstream narrative than actually do their own research for the sake of their child, no longer my body my choice it’s someone else’s body your choice, that in my opinion is the scariest part of all of this. It is absolutely his body and his choice and if you can deal with that then good, however i have noticed that this type of thinking bleeds into many other aspects of a persons personality in general. I wish you luck either way OP.</p>

        <p>My husband and I are struggling with something similar.  Although we both don't want the jab we have different opinions on the masks.  I'm firmly against them because they have been scientifically proven over and over again to NOT work.  He still clings to them and is frustrated that I don't make our daughter wear one.  He tells me I'm not being careful and I am putting the health of our family at risk. 🙄  We fight about this at least every 2 weeks.  I'm burnt out on this argument.  He'll sometimes concede that the masks don't work against the virus, but then throws in that it could work against the variants or viral shedding.🤦</p>

<p>Lets not question why your travel can be restricted.... lets just get the shot so I can travel...... uhhhhhh you are on the wrong wave length!!!!!!</p>
<p>If they aren't outraged the government shut down all normal life and are now trying to make everyone inject barely tested drugs into their bodies and saying ITS OK JUST DO IT.... I mean holy shit.........  </p>
<p>what if you had kids.......... you'd have to battle to not have your kids to get injected...and they might do it behind your back.... AND ITS KILLING KIDS.</p>
<p>You've got a special kind of blind one.</p>

        <p>I’m in the exact same situation. My boyfriend isn’t really on either side but will not read or watch anything I send him cuz he says it’s too long. He’s probably gonna get vaccinated because he wants to travel. We both really want children in a few years, but if he takes it I told him I’m not sure about having children. But he still wants to take it. It’s so tough.</p>

        <p>You should absolutely consider ending it, especially if you ever want to have kids some day. Not only is that mindset toxic to raising well-rounded children (he would likely neglect them leaving you to do all the work), but you may not even be able to HAVE kids due to this horrible vaccine’s effects on fertility.</p>
<p>It does come down to whether you think he as a person is worth being invested in for the rest of your life, and based on everything you have said in this post, the answer is ABSOLUTELY NOT. There are far better men out there.</p>

        <p>I'm not going to tell you to stay or go. I may have my opinion, but it's your decision. But I would say consider the way he's acting as big signs. And maybe ask him how he would feel if you did not get the vaccine (even if you are undecided on this, ask the question as if it's decided). Ask him what he would do if he could travel or do things, but you could not. That may give you an answer on how you want to proceed from here or how you will be treated. I do not think you are crazy either.</p>

        <p>My take is regardless of the vaxx, the two of you don’t share the same values. You clearly value skepticism, knowledge, your health, rationality, etc. This guy doesn’t even read, and won’t put in a modicum of effort to become informed about something that has killed people and is considering just blindly putting it into his body. Typically relationships don’t work long term if most values aren’t shared.</p>

        <p>My boyfriend is also pro- Covid vaccine. Otherwise, our relationship is good. I was just changing the subject when it came up. He did give me an ultimatum and I basically lied and told him I got the vaccine. But I also use Prophylactic Ivermectin. So, the way I arrange my mind around this stupid situation is that I am using the treatment that I am comfortable with. He doesn't need to know my medical business. We aren't married! Ever since I told him I got it, it hasn't come up again.</p>
<p>I don't recommend this at all. Frankly, I don't feel great about it either.</p>
<p>I am not against ever getting a COVID vaccine, but I am not comfortable doing it right now with all of the hype and control. That is my 2 cents. Everyone needs to make their own personal decisions.</p>

        <p>Ran into the same thing. Best advice that has helped is to just back down and respect their strong desire to get vaccinated. This is the Pied Piper fable come true. There's no reasoning just let them follow the Piper promises that everything is going to be alright, period. </p>
<p>But agreeing to respect, not discuss, just support has at least got rid of the tension that was getting between us and family members etc. They actually backed down on me and started showing respect for my views on this.</p>

        <p>It sounds like this casts doubt on his desire/ability to analyze info and make a good choice. This is scary for anyone in a serious relationship since his decisions can affect you and potential future children as well.</p>
<p>Also sounds like he might’ve already known his vaccination date when he told you he “wants to get vaccinated” and was just softening the blow by putting it that way.</p>

        <p>Sounds a lot like my co worker who got the vaccine “just cuz”. You both sound like you’re miles apart on this situation. It’s hard to end a relationship (or even think about it), but it could be for the best and for your peace of mind.</p>

        <p>this type of person is the one that you would never have a rational arguement with.<br>
perhaps wants to be always right, but doesnt know anything about a specific topic. low attentionspan = low intelligence, also associates with greed and selfishness.<br>
not the type of person you wanna spend your life with. youre clearly more intelligent than him because you wanna look for actual reasons than believing what is fed to you by tv/news.<br>
If I believed everything the media says, I wouldve never been successful. They are like shepards and if you are little sheep, you will do what they say. Not what you want. <br>
Be careful now of these spike proteins, Im not an expert, but if the thing is in the whole body, maybe it would spread onto you interms of fluid exchange?  But I dont know.  Just be careful, and do not let others who are less intelligent than you, drag you down. That's what losers do. Winners pick others up to win, not to lose. Youre the winner here that doesnt take an experimental vaccine. So keep that in mind.</p>

        <p>I've lost fake friends I've known for 5+ years over a single phone call. Some people are fragile, overly emotional, and a ticking time bomb. My advise to you would be to ask yourself what type of guy your partner is, if you feel like you're walking on egg shells, than chances are you should leave this relationship before you waste another year in it and it comes crashing down anyways. Sometimes you stubbornly try to force a relationship to work, and end up in a heartbreak years later thinking to yourself "if only I moved on before, if only I had left earlier".</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, most of us would likely accept the vaccine if it was fairly vetted and disputed, then put through the same rigor and testing all other vaccines that we accept in society have been like MMR and tetanus. A lot of my disdain for the vaccine is how shutdown the narrative is around it. Legitimate concerns gone by the wayside? That in itself for me reeks. </p>

        <p>No, no pressure at all. I don't know about the future, if we were to have kids. I think I would make a call then because he keeps saying "I'm the smart one" in this relationship.</p>
<p>I think the issue here goes deeper than vaccine itself. I love to do research (also that's my proffesional field). I like to learn about most random things - lately healthy diets and finances. I can never share my newest discoveries with him - because he just doesn't get it. He has no drive for finding out new things - that's the deal breaking difference between us.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I see that a big difference between the two of you is that you sound quite intellectual and he doesn't. I think your ages and whether you see marriage/kids in the near future could help you make your decision. If you're fairly young, he may mature and change, but if you're already in your 30s, maybe not.</p>

        <p>I think that a lot of people throw relationships away too quickly these days, although that's just a personal opinion. If you really like other things about this man, though, I'd stay with him, unless this vaccine/no critical thinking thing really turns you into a steaming ball of rage. If it's just a mild irritant that you can put up with, and you've gotten along well thus far, I'd stick with it. Although I'd say all bets are off if he pressures YOU to get the jab.</p>

        <p>I feel for you. I've pretty much always been the person I am today in some way. Even back as a teen when the internet was in its early stages, I was on there reading conspiracy theories. I've been anti big-pharma since childhood, being ill all my life I saw firsthand how evil this industry  (and sadly, many doctors) are. So I fully get where you're coming from regarding looking into EVERYTHING for yourself and trusting nothing automatically.</p>
<p>I wish I had better advice. This is a lonely path, not going to lie. Struggling to connect with the average type of person has always been an issue for me and one reason I'm still single at 40.</p>
<p>If it helps, a lot of people are waking up now, I think. I feel more hope of finding love now than ever before. So if you end up not wanting to be with this guy, you won't necessarily be alone. I keep saying it, but we need our own dating app.</p>

        <p>I know so many people that just ignore any evidence I show them that goes against the mainstream agenda. It’s almost like a creepy brainwashed cult. Ignorance is bliss. Until it’s not. Also, the argument “everyone is getting it” is used by my family as well. First I ask them why they have to blindly follow the majority of people for no reason and then I tell them there are millions of people refusing the vaccine. That’s why the age for getting vaccinated keeps getting lower. I always say, you can only try to help a person so much. Some people only learn the hard way.</p>

        <p>Hey there! </p>
<p>This post could've been written by me. </p>
<p>Link to my post -&rt; https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o3fxgz/gf_will_get_the_vaccine_next_thursday_and_im/</p>
<p>In my case it's the roles are reversed. I'm the guy concerned about this vax and my GF is the one who didn't want to listen to any of my concerns. I spend hours putting together a PDF for her with articles / studies / interviews in regards to my concerns of the vax, the suppression of ivermectin and the misused PCR-Testing method on which this whole theatre is based. </p>
<p>She didn't even want to look at it. Should've spent those hours watching a movie or something... Fucking hell it's so frustrating. She dismissed me for even having concerns and called me a conspiracy theorist. The thing is I wasn't even against her getting it - just not yet. The troubling part for me, as it seems to be for you is that they didn't even take some time to really listen to us. But as the saying goes "If you don't listen, you got to learn the hard way." </p>
<p>All I wanted was to be heard and taken seriously and for her to wait a little longer before going into this decision without being properly informed. </p>
<p>When I asked her if she would give this vax to her kids she said she doesn't know since she doesn't have any yet. Well duh. That's something to really think about before having any. I just see so much potential for future conflict in this whole thing. Her taking the vax, which she did two days ago, is just the tip of an iceberg that is a far deeper problem.  If our partner isn't even remotely open to our concerns and won't take us seriously how are we to act in future scenarios when it comes to kids? I honestly feel less attracted to her too since all of this and I'm honestly on the brink of breaking up with her. </p>
<p>I can't really give you any advice regarding your similar situation, but I just wanted to let you know, that you're not alone with this and YOU ARE NOT THE CRAZY ONE. </p>
<p>I hope the both of us will come to a decision that is aligned with what's important to us.</p>

        <p>Even if the covid vaccine was safe, it was weird that his thought process is so scrambled and limited. You aren’t crazy and I’d definitely consider ending it. Because if that’s how he makes decisions imagine trying to make important life decisions like that In a day for 10 seconds. I couldn’t do it.</p>

        <p>I don't think you've noticed but the majority of people that oppose this vaccine don't do it because they think there's a microchip in it. In fact, the only people that ever mention microchips being associated with the vaccine are pro-vaccine - trying to discredit anyone that hesitates by resorting to childish, elementary school finger pointing.   </p>
<p>Honestly, prior to vaccine availability, if you weren't exercising every day, taking vitamins, and eating healthy... you should probably just shut the fuck up. 🐑🐑🐑</p>

        <p>I don't think side effects are insanely rare. The fact that people who speak about it are being censored tells me something is not right here. Also what about people who recovered - they don't have a natural immunity? What about deaths from other causes that are being counted as covid, artificially increasing the numbers? Opposed to that everytime we hear something about side effects or death from them media makes sure to say it wasn't in any way related to vax. I'm not buying any of that.</p>

        <p>There's not much to think about though is there, is a vaccine for a harmful disease that is going about. I understand a little initial trepidation but once hundreds of millions of people have gotten it without major ill effect, why wouldn't you?</p>

        <p>studies are already running, the original test cohorts are still involved. given when they started there has been ample opportunity for long term effects to show but if you are still scared its ok to wait a little longer, given how vaccinations ramped up after original approvals the sample size for vaccinated &rt; 6months will be enormous 👍</p>
