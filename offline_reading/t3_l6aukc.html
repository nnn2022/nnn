    <strong>Expert Scientist from r/CovIdiots acknowledges that lockdowns, mask mandates, and other restrictions are NOT BASED ON SCIENCE. 😲😲 Then r/Covidiots bans me for making it public 😁😁😁!!!</strong>

<p>https://preview.redd.it/61wf0dop1xd61.jpg?width=1052&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f66cbd6cf3008745b4a27a21a28b95260a933d65</p>
<p>This morning I posted in r/CovIdiots a link to a recent scientific paper which clearly proves that restrictive measures like lockdowns, confinements, mask mandates, etc. are not effective to fight the spread of the controllavirus. There were two debates in the comments and in one of them what you see in the caption happened.</p>
<p>He started a debate and he was trying devalue the scientific paper (typical covid19 ezpert..), so he was doing abstract critics against it, just to say something, because the study is pretty solid as it compares countries which implemented restrictions against countries from those which didn't (like S. Korea and Sweden), and the comparison didn't produce any significant result.</p>
<p>In order to dismiss the paper, he ended up saying that it is impossible to run scientific experiments to find out which restrictive measures work or not. So, he is basically saying that the decisions to implement lockdowns and mask mandates are not based on scientific studies or results, because for him those are impossible to obtain. Bingo!! That's what we been saying all along...</p>
<p>He is actually wrong on that, as you can easily prove through the scientific method (like the scientists who wrote the paper I shared did) that these restrictions don't work. What you can't prove is that they work, because they actually don't work. But the value of what he says still remains: he believes that the restrictive measures taken by governments are not based on science at all, as for him is impossible to make science over it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PD: I indicate that he is an Expert, because in the conversation he says that he is a "physical scientist" who dedicates to "critically analyze academic papers and evaluate their rigor on a daily basis". So it comes from his own mouth.</p>
<p>To read the full exchange, click <a href="https://i.ibb.co/q1pqBHV/Untitled.jpg">here</a>. I had to upload to a image server as the mods in r/CovIdiots banned me and deleted my comments (they love science over there, clearly...)</p>

        <p>The numbers are going up because they are manipulating the testing cycles, Kary Mullis (the creator of the tests) explained it quite clear many times. Plus, the virus hasn't been isolated, so they are not even testing for any "virus". There is a group of scientist who published a scientific paper proving how wrong the testing is. You can check it <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346483715_External_peer_review_of_the_RTPCR_test_to_detect_SARS-CoV-2_reveals_10_major_scientific_flaws_at_the_molecular_and_methodological_level_consequences_for_false_positive_results">here</a>.</p>

        <p>That study ignores all voluntary measures that the populations of those countries took, and pretends that the government actions were the only thing that mattered.  They just looked at the mandates, and the rates, without factoring in anything else.  They are over-simplifying the problem.</p>
<p>Using a very small set of countries, they tried to pretend that the populations in every country behaved the same, and only did exactly what their government mandated they do, so they could say the less invasive restrictions were just as effective.</p>
<p>They don't even <em>attempt</em> to factor in the rate of compliance with the mandates.  That seems like an important omission, given that citizens of S. Korea are more likely to heed government advice than Americans.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/425281/south-korea-officials-expand-covid-19-restrictions-nationwide-through-jan-17-covid-19-test-required-for-inbound-foreigners-from-jan-8-update-49">South Korea</a> expanded their government mandates to combat COVID.  They ended up taking almost all the same steps that other governments did - stay at home orders, closing business, limiting gatherings, etc.  </p>
<p>So much for that example - S. Korea felt the need to move towards mrNPI's.  They did this on the day this study was published, LOL.</p>
<p>In the end, what they STILL found was that every country that implemented those measures had a decrease in the infection rate.</p>
<p>Are the authors of the paper wrong?  No.  <em>From the perspective they studied</em>, the mrNPI's had little significant effect.  But the <em>perspective they studied</em> is deeply flawed and ignores huge cultural differences and huge differences in how the mandates were enforced.</p>

        <p>Because we had a president that refused to admit it was a real threat that he absolutely mishandled? But if you double down and convince people there was no problem in the first place, then you can't exactly be blamed for mishandling the problem.</p>
<p>My entire argument is that, if we all concertedly treated this virus as a pandemic, then we would be out of it in a month. But we're atill mincing words on if it's a threat or not.</p>

        <p>There is a 99.997% chance the general public will survive with out treatment. I have had covid. I know multiple people that have had covid. This is not a pandemic and the response to this is so over blown and inconsistent. </p>
<p>Why are people dying and others not needing any treatment at all? Why are treatments being kept from patients? Why are doctors being forced to push a narrative that isn’t consistent with what’s happening in the field. Why are doctors being censored? Do you not ask yourself any of these questions?</p>

<p>I hope you know this is something being actively investigated by the scientific and medical community. It's a virus that affects the circulatory system, which can show itself in many ways. Commonly down simulations are when it affects the fine capillaries in the nose or the lungs. A lot is still unknown because virology takes time.</p>
<p>&rt;Why are treatments being kept from patients? Why are doctors being forced to push a narrative that isn’t consistent with what’s happening in the field. </p>
<p>Where is this happening? Unless you're referring to the poorly cobbled together study on hydroxy chloroquine (while likely being doubtful of the new vaccines?) as a magic bullet.</p>
<p>&rt;Why are doctors being censored? Do you not ask yourself any of these questions?</p>
<p>Not sure what doctors your are referring to, but the scientific community isn't like a religion. Status usually deserves respect, but even respected scientists are held to high standards of peer review and reproducibility. Being a doctor doesn't mean everything you say on medicine is correct.</p>
