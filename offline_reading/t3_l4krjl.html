    <strong>Feeling isolated - how do I meet some like minded people right now?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm surrounded by well educated middle class people who seem to be the most insufferable lemmings of them all. It feels like all of my friends have lost their damn minds, although when I really think about it, they have always been very groupthink. The difference was just that, before, the stakes weren't so high, so I could ignore it.  </p>
<p>Has anyone had any luck meeting people who are on the same page? How did you manage it?</p></p>
