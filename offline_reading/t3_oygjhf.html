    <strong>The antivaxx narrative is wrong. For the most part.</strong>
    <p><p><em>TLDR at bottom</em></p>
<p>As said in the headline, this false narrative purported onto us by those who are accepting of this gross violation of human rights is simply inaccurate. While many are anti vaxx in all ways (and these opinions should be respected and validated) many of us have received many or all previous vaccines offered to us, but have hesitancy towards this one because of various reasons, those most commonly being apprehension at the new mRNA technology, mixed messages and misinformation from the media, big pharmas shady past, and the HUGE push to get this vaccine.
  I don‚Äôt know if we can dispel this mistruth with those on the other side but I feel if we could get them past that narrative, we could perhaps find some common ground. I would say with confidence most of us don‚Äôt care about the vaccination status of another individual, we are more concerned with losing our civil liberties. Once you give a mouse a cookie, he‚Äôs going to want a glass of milk and I see this evidenced in the fact that mandates are being placed back even for vaccinated individuals.
  I know this was long, but I wanted to just express my sentiments in a safe place. Maybe if we get out and express to our vaxxed friends and neighbors that we don‚Äôt want to get them sick, put them in danger or anything, we simply want to keep ourselves safe and aren‚Äôt comfortable with this new vaccine yet, we can reach common ground.</p>
<p>TLDR- banishing the ‚Äúunvaccinated are anti vaxx for the most part‚Äù narrative could help us start working together, albeit I know this is a very ‚ÄúLennonesque‚Äù ideal.</p></p>

        <p>you got it right. Most of us are fully vaccinated here. We just dont trust this one in particular.</p>

        <p>Agree. Yesterday I finally decided to post something on Facebook, which I haven't done in years. But, I framed it as anti-authoritarian rather than anti-vax. I realized that while I'm not vaccinated, I don't have to disclose that. Instead, when asked, I can start saying I think the question shouldn't even be asked of me nor an answer demanded. It's rude and it's leading to division and hatred. </p>
<p>Then, in defense of the claim that people are anti-vax if they don't take the shot, the point can be made that there are some anti-vaxers out there, there are some that are specifically Covid Vax hesitant, some that have had the virus and are immune, and then there are some who cannot take the vaccine for medical reasons. We could, and should, defend anyone in any of those categories. And by we, I mean literally everyone regardless of Vax status.</p>
<p>But I've also realized that a big part of the narrative and belief is that we can outrun the virus with vaccine herd immunity. That is false and always has been. That is the belief that is driving people towards this madness. They want the virus gone and instead of accepting that isn't happening, they want to scapegoat as part of their denial. It feels good to them to think there is an answer and an enemy and a way to overcome and move on. It's just they are being lied to and are lying to themselves.</p>
<p>Fear drives denial, anger, manipulation, coercion, controlling behaviors, and much more. People will do anything to make the fear go away, except accept reality especially when they are being fed a false scapegoat. This played out after 9/11. I protested the wars and the Patriot Act then, just as I am protesting the power grab now. And I plan to point that out.</p>
<p>Y'all, I got screamed at, demeaned by loved ones, called anti-american and even put on a government watch list back then. It was worth it, I was right and now 99% of the people agree. They were afraid then and being lied to. They wanted control and decided if they gave it to the government they could feel safe again.</p>
<p>I'm just rambling üòÖ</p>

        <p>Most of us are pro vaccine, but this fact is irrelevant if not reported.  When you can control what is in the news, who cares what the truth is?</p>
<p>edit: so I'm clear, I believe vaccines are a vital human development that has saved millions or billions of lives.  this mrna shot (or any covid spike protein delivery) is dangerous for a mild disease.</p>

        <p>I'm not anti vaxx. I just don't waht to take 5-10 shots of the new teq, if there where a vaccine available (chineese is the only one I think) using old tested teq I might take it, for now I still have t-cells and so on since earlier infections.  What I am against is bullying those who don't want to take the vax, vaccine passport, lockdowns, facism, big pharma, putting people against eatchother, msn for not being objective, as for governments and much more..  btw I dont like politics from eny side as long as it is us against them, and roughly 50% of the population always disagrees with the current ruler.  And for those who call me dumb, I am near mensa in IQ (top 6%) and as much in eq.</p>

        <p>You don‚Äôt have to have issue with all vexxines to be against how they‚Äôve been running the business behind them. They‚Äôve been operating under this regulatory capture model for decades, enriching themselves and hiding harm. You can‚Äôt address the issue by picking around the moldy parts, the whole ‚Äúhealth‚Äù system behind this current mess is rotten.</p>
