    <strong>You have a Higher Lifetime Risk of Dying in a Car Accident than Dying From Coronavirus</strong>
    <p><p>The lifetime risk of dying in a car accident in the UK (one of the safest driving countries in the world) is 1/240 (\~0.4%).</p>
<p>Spain's CFR for coronavirus since May is 0.4%. IFR is almost certainly much lower, many estimates putting it around0.1-0.2%.</p>

        <p>To be honest the lockdown has made me so much more highly aware of the danger of car accidents and have been more nervous.  To see how the numbers of car wrecks went down so much during lockdown was sobering.</p>

        <p>Much like coronavirus, the risk of dying in car accidents is not evenly distributed. Simply avoiding the highway between the hours of 10pm and 5am will <em>dramatically</em> reduce your risk of serious injury or death.</p>

        <p>I know I'm not alone in this observation because I've had this discussion with several people on here. Ever since March I've noticed that people are driving faster, crazier, and getting distracted by their phones even more than before; and it was already getting bad here the last few years. </p>
<p>I've noticed a lot more 'road-rage' incidents as well, even had someone rage at me in a <strong>construction zone</strong> 6mi long, tailgating me then turning on their brights while doing 65-70. There was no shoulder to let them pass by, after the zone ended they blocked the other lane and honked at me a bunch so they definitely didn't have an emergency. I wish I would have reported the area as unsafe, because 3 days later there was an accident in same spot that killed a 12yr old and a 23yr old.</p>

        <p>ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  Dying in a car wreck has nothing to do with this slightly worse version of the flu that’s going around.  Trump went in and edited those numbers just to make himself look good for re-election.  And if you don’t see that, you deserve to die of COVID.</p>

        <p>Also if the virus spreads uncontrolled, maybe 50% of people will get infected, and if you do die in a car accident, you'll probably lose a lot more of your life than someone who dies of covid.</p>

        <p>Ahhh... but this isn’t a one time event. This virus isn’t going anywhere. It’s a mutation (natural or engineered) of a species that we have been familiar with for close to a century. It will continue to come around. We now live with it, just like the coronavirii that cause “the common cold”. </p>
<p>Which is precisely why these people acting like we can do something to make it go away are either compete idiots and/or charlatans who are taking advantage of the situation and should be removed from their status forcefully.</p>

        <p>One of my friends has had two car wrecks, neither his fault. In both cases, the driver who hit him was speeding, and he (friend) had to be hospitalized. The first accident resulted in head trauma that cost him some of his memory. He couldn't recall some of his friends. Thankfully, he seemed to recover later, as he remembered after the friends he forgot introduced themselves.</p>
<p>He's a lot more afraid of getting in other people's cars than of catching any virus.</p>

        <p>You are a special kind of stupid.  To participate in society means to actively resist these lockdowns because they are killing people.  Viruses spread.  That’s the way it works, and you don’t understand that.  It’s not instant death any time you get it either.  By your logic, we should continue to cover our faces and put distance markers on the floor, and freak out whenever someone is 5’11” away instead of 6 ft.  You have the rest of Reddit to cower in fear, so please get out of this thread and reserve it for the people who are realistic.  And by realistic, I mean not freaking out and living in terror over a virus with a less than 1% fatality rate than only affects OLD PEOPLE WITH OTHER CONDITIONS.</p>
