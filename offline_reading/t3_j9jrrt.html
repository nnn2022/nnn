    <strong>Make no mistake, the alternative to the "Focused Protection" plan is the "Great Reset"</strong>
    <p><p>I find it interesting that governments with lockdown-friendly policies aren't really transparent with their constituents on what the end-goal of these policies are. Is it to eradicate the virus? Is it to slow-down infections? If so, for how long? What are the indicators that need to be reached to put an end to these restrictions? Until a hypothetical efficient and safe vaccine is found? Until we vaccinated the entire global population? Health authorities recognize that even a vaccine wouldn't be synonymous with going back to normal. In most cases, the answers to these questions are unclear.</p>
<p>Yes, there are many governments who implemented color-coded frameworks but they usually have no level to which we would "go back to normal". As a matter of fact, it's pretty clear by now that there won't be a "going back to normal" many businesses won't return to the office no matter what and this will have a profound impact on many sectors of our society.</p>
<p>The "Focused Protection" plan advocates for stopping this process and aims as much as possible to going back to some sort of normality but what is the alternative of going down the trajectory that has been initiated by the lockdown policies? The answer is no secret and it was provided by the World Economic Forum, it is <a href="https://youtu.be/pfVdMWzKwjc?t=249">"The Great Reset"</a> (regardless of what people associate with this term and whatever shape or form this reset would take).</p>
<p>I don't like binary-thinking but I don't see what would be the third alternative. If you see otherwise please enlight me.</p></p>

        <p>Would anyone please debate me on this instead of just down-vote? What is the justification for depriving elderly and their families of their rights, the possibility that care workers who already have a tough job quiting because of these measures and most upsetting, why should we allow targeting of multigenerational <em>households</em>? Especially in light of the Canadian parliment vid that was here the other day about internment camps, and some other local legislation around the world that speaks of seperating families ?</p>

        <p>The spirit of the declaration isn't to deprive the vulnerable of their rights. The measures advocated in the declaration would be temporary ("until we reach herd immunity"). In the video, they mentioned a period of 3 months. Also, the declaration also mentions that those who wish to resume their activity could do so ("People who are more at risk may participate if they wish"). If you have a case to demonstrate that these measures restrict civil liberties more than the current ones, I'd like to hear it.</p>

        <p>My argument is that i see no reason why we should give up anyones liberties. This is the tactic everyone warned of, make things so bad that 1/2 bad will be a relief and the new normal they wanted. And like the Patriot act was only suppposed to be a few months, 3 months , like the 2 wks we were promised? I also question what herd immunity as a goal would be.  Flu or other coronas dont really have a herd immunity. People are going to continue to test positive for it at about the rate we see now. All over something that even vulnerable people survive?</p>

        <p>&rt;My argument is that i see no reason why we should give up anyones liberties.</p>
<p>I agree but we already did. The "Focused Protection" measures would ultimately resume everyone's liberties in a much shorter period of time that what the current plan aims to do (which is never?).</p>
<p>&rt;I also question what herd immunity as a goal would be. Flu or other coronas dont really have a herd immunity.</p>
<p>Herd immunity is a biological fact for every virus. The reason the flu comes back every year is that the virus mutates to bypass the previously acquired immunity. It's too early to tell whether this new coronavirus will mutate in a way that will make it dangerous again or not. In any case, it doesn't make much sense to slow down the acquisition of immunity for this virus as we will have to get there at some point.</p>
<p>&rt;People are going to continue to test positive for it at about the rate we see now.</p>
<p>True but that's a problem with our current testing policy. We would get the same issues if we were testing for the flu as we do for this new coronavirus. The GBD isn't calling for mass testing campaigns.</p>
<p>&rt;All over something that even vulnerable people survive?</p>
<p>So you're suggesting that we should reopen everything without trying to mitigate casualties? I understand your point but from a public relations point-of-view, I think The Great Barrington Declaration gets it right (and it is still hard to sell).</p>
<p>To the point of this thread. If you oppose the current situation, why opposing the GBD? It is the alternative that is getting some traction and I think can accommodate most opponents to The Great Reset.</p>

        <p>what do you think people did when they fought wars? We didnt give up our rights, they were taken from us over night. Now we know what we are in for we can and should fight for them. The more you show them you are willing to give up, the more they will take. It will not mutate to become more dangerous, none of the other coronas have, BUT it was never very dangerous to start. The point is danger doesnt matter, theyre using positive cases as a metric.</p>
<p>Mitigating causulties cant be done, if it could covid cases would be much less, and people need to understand the science behind why it never was that dangerous and why it cant be mitigated. People need to learn from this and learn about real science not msm sensationalism, plastering over reality will only make it worse.</p>

        <p>As I said, it is a PR problem. You need to convince people who are scared to death. It's not by saying that they have been scared for nothing that you'd get them on your side. Also, you need to plant a thorn into the mainstream narrative which is to oppose "lockdown measures" VS. "no lockdown measures". I think the GBD has the potential to change this narrative and that's why they avoid covering it.</p>

        <p>Then why not address that? We can do that, and it can be done with science, and  persistance, the virus has been mutating, mutating to become even weaker, just like SARS did. There are the studies that show cross immunity. These are the things that should be put to the forefront . Stopping the promotion of fear in MSM and by the government itself is actually the primary hurdle.</p>
