        <p>All we want is a return to normal where we can be together happily, safely, comfortably, ...friendly...ly.  Being attacked or shamed because you aren't following the trendy narrative sucks, and should never be part of a scientific discussion or a societal approach to a problem.</p>
<p>Congrats on the vax, and hopefully people will start to realize vaccines do work, and stop being so full of fear and hate!</p>

        <p>I am your Guinea pig! And no, I am not full of fear and hate. </p>
<p>Ever since I got round 2 (which gave me no issues btw) I felt "empowered" and LITERALLY the NEXT day the CDC recommendations came out and I was for lack of a better word "elated" that I could least go out in an open setting sans mask!</p>
<p>Now when it comes to entering business/buildings I will ALWAYS err on the side of caution and don my mask (unless stated is a nonrequirement)</p>
<p>Please understand that I will 100% follow the CDC guidelines. IF and ONLY IF they ask for requirements, distancing and closure will I follow, I am vaxxed and I am PROUD!</p>

        <p>I would like to ask, if you believe the vaccines work (and I do), why bother with the mask?  Are you worried you will still get sick?  Or you'll manage to get someone else sick?  Or purely as a courtesy to the shop owner who requests it?</p>

        <p>Your question is 100% valid! Because I am vaccinated, I will listen to the CDC recommendations, outside = mask off, inside = If required yes, otherwise it depends, cuz I'm vaxt...</p>

        <p>After a bunch of these sorts of conversations, it seems to come back to trust in the government, and in general, I have none.  From a past working with several 3-letter US gov agencies and watching the decision- and policy-making processes, while there may have been science in the works somewhere, it's filtered through layers of management (usually without current, or any, domain expertise), agenda, personal motivations and biases, and finally by political pressure from the administration at the time, as well as often industry pressure.  There is a long and sordid history of oil and food industries setting health and environmental policy under the guise of science.  Like the food pyramid.  And even plastic recycling (that was a ploy by the oil industry to make plastic use widely acceptable!).</p>
<p>So for me, a scientific statement attributed to the CDC, WHO, any politician, etc., is worth far less to me than a no-name scientist without (much) skin in the game.</p>
<p>Beyond that, even if I thought them capable of producing quality scientific studies and public policy based on those studies, I don't actually believe that any branch of the government has MY personal well being in mind.  Their policies are a combination of compiled data and studies, yes, but also response to public pressure, hopes of getting re-elected, party alignment, political leverage, catering to big contributors, and even then can only apply as a balance for people in general, not my case in particular.  They will always play health policies on the "safe" side, but by their own actions on travel and dining over the last year, clearly don't feel the risk profile applies equally to everyone.</p>
<p>So I will always do my own research (my wife is a bio phd) and come to my own determination, with the advice of large political bodies rarely even registering on what I consider healthy and safe for myself and family.  Just as the cdc forbids rare meat, sushi, ceviche, runny eggs, (and hundreds more) and we make our own measurements of risk, I feel comfortable doing so regarding transmissible diseases as well.</p>

        <p>Look FWIW I am just your standard Reddit schmuck, what I say has ABSOLUTLEY zero to do outside of the Redditsphere, and I never liked having to wear a mask, but I did what I felt was the "socially responsible" thing, you know mask up, keep at a distance.</p>
<p>Now that I am vaxed, and based on the CDC guidelines being outside and maintaining a distance from people there is ZERO reason to have the mask on. If a store or building REQUIRES me to wear one, I will comply. Outside of that middle fingers all around, IM VAXXED BITCH, VAXED RICK BABY!!!!!!</p>

        <p>Now just imagine you were predisposed to a libertarian perspective. The government is just making shit up as they go with a complete disregard for your rights and they're turning your neighbors into mask vigilantes.</p>
