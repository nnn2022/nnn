    <strong>Meditations on Moloch; or, Conspiracies Without Co-conspirators</strong>
    <p><p>Lockdowns threaten to permanently change how we relate to society, to work, to each other. It's not completely clear exactly what the future will look like, but it's a safe bet that it will be more conducive to digital life and less conducive to physical life. Work, school and socializing will be widely replaced by unrecognizable imitations. It would be possible to revert to the old ways, but few will want to, and even fewer will know how to.</p>
<p>Tech companies will laugh all the way to the bank. Governments' emergency powers will become ordinary powers. Newer, more pernicious forms of oppression will be developed. Entertainment will continue to accelerate, with more and more psychologically powerful Skinner boxes distracting people from their grim material reality.</p>
<p>This can feel like the culmination of a plan to domesticate humans further by destroying traditional ways of life. They must be laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>There's only one problem: who is "they"?</p>
<p>Bezos doesn't have this kind of control on the world. Gates doesn't. The US deep state might be able to pull this off domestically, but no one would have any reason to, and it would remain to be explained why the other countries are doing the same thing.</p>
<p>The only explanation would be an all-powerful shadowy cabal of cosmopolitan conspirators. You can try looking for them. And indeed conspiracy theorists have over the year found a number of odd coincidences that would be explained by such a shadowy cabal.</p>
<p>But look at actual historical conspiracies. Operation Northwoods, the Business Plot, Operation Gideon, whatever. For conspiracies involving more than two or three people "in the know", there are two common themes: at least some of the people involved are tragically incompetent, and the entire operation leaks like a sieve. They don't always fail, but even when they succeed they never come close to staying secret for very long.</p>
<p>If lockdowns are a small piece of a wider tapestry of domination, there must be a conspiracy. Yet if this is truly how conspiracies operate, then how could there possibly be one?</p>
<p>For me the antidote to this kind of thinking was <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Meditations on Moloch</a>. It's a pretty long and abstract piece, but essentially it tries to answer the above question - "who is 'they'?" - with a personification of the system.</p>
<p>The piece describes a metaphorical god of discord named Moloch. He is described precisely and with great elaboration. The piece establishes that Moloch is the cause of much war, famine, poverty, alienation, excess, etc. It describes Moloch's methods and causes, how and why from well-intended men and women he creates systems of pain and privation.</p>
<p>But there's a figure-ground illusion here. Moloch is not a person or a god or an entity, it is a specific component of the system we live in. And once you do away with this agent-like description of the entity, there is nothing left to explain. Of course we're being atomized and alienated and locked down and ground into dust; Moloch wills it. This is different from religious mysticism because Moloch is predictable, systematic, and entirely determined by material conditions. Its causes and effects are out in the open.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend anyone who views themselves as conspiracy-curious give this piece a fair shake. Its author is a renowned thinker who doesn't dabble in bullshit, and who's actually quite sympathetic to certain conspiracy theories; just not any of them.</p></p>

        <p>I'm having trouble making sense of this. Are you saying Moloch is a conspiracy or not?</p>

        <p>I'm saying that there is no conspiracy in the strict sense, no shadowy cabal calling the shots. Nevertheless, the world is still going in the direction it would if the lockdown conspiracy theories were true. These conspiracy theories aren't completely unmoored from reality. Their main error is to posit that a group of goal-directed agents are behind exaggerated lockdowns, whereas the actual cause is an out-of-control superposition of market and social incentives.</p>

        <p>Ah. I would respectfully disagree,  but I could see how it could be that way. Even if the "cabal" were only a few people it wouldn't take much to push a "go along to get along" attitude. Especially in social media. Lemmings off the cliff.</p>

        <p>There are definitely conspiracies, but they must be small-scale. I'm thinking of something along the lines of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JournoList">JournoList thing</a>. Some experts at the CDC and WHO have conspired to mislead the public "for their own good" and to cover their own asses. Some editorial boards have brainstormed how to cover the virus in a maximally alarmist way to get some click. The key point I'm making is that the individual impact of each conspiracy is small, and there is no Master Conspiracy, no one entity calling the shots and setting the tone.</p>

        <p>Oh, I understand your argument.  And I understand how you can see it that way. I just happen to believe there is one big Master Conspiracy.</p>

        <p>Well... alot of research. It's part of the ultimate question. Why are we here? At the very bottom of that rabbit hole are some hard truths. Hard things to accept. If so many people are so willing to turn a blind eye to say..... censorship (and there are ALOT), then how many truly want to face harsher truths? Truths that humanity has always been seen as property,  and treated as such.  We are livestock.</p>
