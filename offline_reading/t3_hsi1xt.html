    <strong>I wrote to my MP!</strong>
    <p><p>For the first time I have felt strongly enough about something in order to contact my local Conservative MP (That's our local representative in government for the non-Brits out there)</p>
<p>While I don't see this as any magic bullet and have been pretty sceptical in the past, it is surely better for us to get our concerns heard with the right people rather than yelling into the void. </p>
<p>I've decided to publish my letter below in the hopes of encouraging more of you to take the next step. Constructive criticism is welcome.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Dear (Local Representative)<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Despite some doubts about Boris I was happy to vote for both you and your party in the December elections. This was my first time voting in a general election, and my first time voting for your party. However after witnessing the way in which this government has handled the current pandemic, I'm highly unlikely to do so again.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Therefore I am writing to you as a concerned member of your constituency in a feeling of desperation at a government which continues to erode the ancient liberties of this land which have long made this country great.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The dictatorial measure of continued lockdown combined with the mandating of masks are both entirely unproven strategies for disease prevention and sets a dangerous precedent for the future and the civil liberties and freedom many of us hold so dear.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I strongly urge you to consider the level of powers the government has granted itself and whether your role as an elected official has been essentially sidelined in this panic for perceived safety as legislation has quickly been hurried through.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If we want to protect the vulnerable members of our society we need both a strong community and a powerful economy which these measures threaten to rip apart. Mandated masks risk consumer confidence rather than improve it as shops will grow to become a place associated with discomfort and fear. Meanwhile ill and unwell citizens are isolated and are unable to access the level of care they need, while cases of child and domestic abuse go unnoticed.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;From our knowledge of the data at the current time, it appears clear that this virus is far from the death sentence it was predicted, the vast majority of those found positive for COVID-19 have either had no symptoms or are fast recovering and people are now keen to get on with their lives. The British people should be allowed to use their own judgement and take precautions where they see fit, rather than being treated like a naughty child who must be told what to do.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I hope that you will take these concerns seriously and stick up for the people of our constituency. I'd encourage you to make the case for liberty, democracy and sensible decision making with The Prime Minister and help urge the government to correct it's disastrous course.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I look forward to hearing from you.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Your sincerely,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;pseudosafety</p></p>

        <p>Iâ€™m a little bit pissed that a recent YouGov poll asked me if I was confident going to the shops and if I would eat out to help out. I said no but they never asked why.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, I've done my share of YouGov surveys too. When you actually do them, it's incredibly to remember that they are actually used as serious tools of government</p>

        <p>Recently every new policy has been polled on YouGov. Britain is pretty much a direct democracy through them atm.</p>
