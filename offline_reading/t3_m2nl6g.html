    <strong>Don’t think I can go on for much longer</strong>
    <p><p>I have no hope for the future anymore. My life was already in shambles before this bullshit started, I can’t take it anymore. I can’t take the thought of knowing we will never go back to a normal life. If people can take away my right to be a free human being on this earth, I don’t want to live anymore. The lockdowns have destroyed my life, my sanity, my sense of being, everything</p>
<p>My entire family has been broken up and I have to live in constant anxiety for what the next day will bring. The constant fear of the unknown. Being afraid of other people knowing I’ll get harassed/shamed publicly for not following mandates. Being afraid of having someone film me and shame me online. Threats to my safety for not following mandates, being told I should die for having my own opinion. Not seeing anyone fucking smile, everyone is visibly angry, depressed and on the verge of a breakdown. It’s like the whole world is covered in a dark cloud of sadness and despair. Being fed misinformation 24/7, knowing it’s all bullshit but there’s nothing you can do about it. Trying to convince people to listen to you but they are so far gone there’s no saving them. Being called crazy or a “covid-denier” if you dare have a fully reasonable response to why lockdowns are more dangerous than the virus. Literally being called a murderer for wanting to make my own choices</p>
<p>I have nowhere to escape to. No one to get immediate help from if I need it. At home I’m so depressed because of the constant tension and fighting, all I do is drink to numb the pain. Every one of my pre-existing mental illnesses has gotten worse. Lockdown has triggered my eating disorder and self-harm after years of recovery. Going out and doing normal things was my only escape. And now if I do choose to go out, where can I go? I can’t escape the sadness because it’s all around me. I don’t want to go out because I have to worry about these annoying virtue signallers. Everything is closed. I’m genuinely scared to go out without a mask because I feel someone might attack me. I’m a sensitive, reserved person who likes to keep to myself, I can’t handle confrontation. Especially when I didn’t fucking do anything</p>
<p>I’m sick of all the bullshit propaganda messages everywhere. “Stay home, save lives,” we’re losing our fucking minds. Or we already lost them a long time ago. We’re being blatantly lied to and manipulated and no one seems to fucking care, or is too stupid to realize it. And the people that do care are silenced and shamed</p>
<p>I had to wait almost two months to see my doctor in person for a fucking blood test. I’ve been trying to get in-person therapy but what’s the point when I can’t express or see human emotions? Sorry that I can’t receive my healthcare over the phone, when has this ever been okay to these people? They say they care about healthcare but are the same people that smoke/drink/do drugs, eat junk everyday and so on. Now all of a sudden everyone “cares” about health, fucking hilarious. These people didn’t even wash their hands after taking a shit before all of this. Yet no one is talking about the huge increase in domestic abuse, violence, drug/alcohol abuse and suicides.  The statistics are being hidden from us, probably because of how bad they are. It would ruin their agenda</p>
<p>We’re not even allowed to hold the hands of our loved ones dying in the hospital (not from covid but they’ll put it anyways). I feel like I’m already dead at this point. We’re living in hell on earth. What is the point of life if we can’t be fucking human beings? </p>
<p>I’m having my youth stolen from me. I can’t take it anymore. If I kill myself, just know I didn’t die of covid. I’ll just be another statistic at this point, so add me to the death count</p></p>

        <p>Sometimes the ability to comprehend the BS around us is a curse.  The entirety of the response to the situation- complete with inconsistencies and contradictions has me more than a little convinced that this is a "<em>plan</em>demic" and much of what you've written is intentional.  </p>
<p>Screw with the population, and utilize media "information" service to push demagoguery and trumpet concern for "equity" devotion  to underserved communities-- for example.  Shame people for venting and we're pressured to hold the toxicity in- so that it eats away at our sanity.</p>
<p>Good rant- and likely a therapeutic release for you.  Seek more opportunities to release the stress and pressure.  While the virus is very real, it is being utilized to effect sweeping changes in how whole populations see their governments and it is normalizing abnormal, antisocial behavior.</p>

        <p>The biggest problem with having an ability to sniff out BS is in how most everyone else is brainwashed into launching attacks and insults when you dare vent.  Having to hold things in itself creates an exacerbates mental problems.  The mind has a limited capacity to deal with bullshit.</p>

        <p>Knowledge implies fact and while that's certainly a critical part of it I think the key ingredient is the contradictions that we're being forced by mandate to assume as being true.</p>
<p>Figuring out how best to carefully ration the data you take in could prove invaluable to you moving forward and shutting off mainstream sources of news is critical.  The media lies; they are NOT our friends.</p>

        <p>I don’t believe fuck all of what mainstream media pushes. It’s all controlled and programmed to get a specific reaction. I can see through all the bullshit. We’ve seen it since the beginning of the social media age, they’ve realized how easy it is to control people. Everyone’s got their own personal information provider in the palm of their hands</p>
<p>We saw it get really bad right before the pandemic, no coincidence in my opinion. They split everyone into two sides. They use politics to control people’s narrative. A lot of people don’t know the difference between an opinionated article and one with actual factual information or reliable scientific evidence. No one’s allowed to be in the middle anymore. If you even criticize these extremists you’re “racist”, “a right winger”, “transphobic” “covid-denier”...etc</p>
<p>Good example of what’s happening now is the whole drama surrounding the royal family. Just another distraction so people stop caring about what’s going on. Imagine caring about a bunch of billionaires complain about their life because someone made a racist comment to them. Happens everyday, don’t marry a prince if you don’t want all that attention. Can’t believe they thought it was appropriate right now to complain about their lives while everyone is struggling. I think people forgot she was an actress... anyways. This world is a mess. We’ve lost all our priorities</p>

<p>We need more people with your ability <strong>and</strong> willingness to think independently.  It's not that everyone is stupid enough to go along with an amalgamation of official policies that will mandate all healthy people go into lockdown because the virus is so dangerous and easy to transmit but at the same time order nursing homes, which house so many vulnerable people, to take in active cases-- for example; but it's just easier to go along to get along.</p>
<p>Interesting points you've made... and the media polarization is spot freaking on.  Interestingly a few moths before they took aim at the proverbial fan with their engineered shit, I was listening to the radio en route to work and the top of the hour newscast began with the following lead: "Democrats react to Trump's racist tweets".  It was very revealing that a news organization that would refer to someone caught red-handed by police committing an armed robbery as the <em>alleged</em> gunman, characterized the President's social media activity as conclusively racist... not "tweets many consider racist" or any pretense to objectivity... but "Trump's racist tweets".  </p>
<p>That was the last time I suffered through media brainwash labeled as news.  I'd rather be uninformed than misinformed.</p>

        <p>Funny thing is Trump is no worse than any other U.S president. Biden’s dropping bombs on Syria right now, killing countless innocent people and children. But they care about peoples wellbeing apparently</p>
<p>People just hated on Trump because they believe everything they see without actually finding the evidence to support the claims. They get their “news” on facebook or from opinionated articles. He’s literally never said anything racist publicly, it’s really all a matter of personal opinion. There’s too many people that think stating actual facts that involve a different ethnicity of your own means you’re racist. People are so offended by everything because it gives them a sense of power. I mean it’s socially acceptable to be racist to white people these days and no one cares. No one dares question the narrative because these people are so quick to attack, and a lot of them are violent</p>
<p>I personally don’t support either side, I’d rather just think for myself. But I really don’t understand why Trump was painted as the “bad guy.” In fact he actually did a lot for minorities, but because he’s a white man it’s okay to label him falsely and create accusations out of thin air</p>
<p>When you live in a world where anyone who isn’t white can cry racism/sexism/homophobia...etc and people support them without context is fucking terrifying. Free speech is no more</p>

        <p>Here's the rub on that... it's a media thing and this is sort of a media/political rant.</p>
<p>Back during the GWB administration, "corporate personhood" was reaffirmed with regard to its First Amendment rights.  The context given was political donations as a form of speech and laws limiting  contributions from corporations were deemed to be unconstitutional (if I remember correctly).  The money aspect of it I believe to be a smokescreen.</p>
<p>News media, social media, etc. are corporate entities.  Those corporations enjoy first amendment rights.  In no way does "free speech" mandate honesty; neither does it prohibit the pushing of a political agenda nor does it restrain the injection of editorial content into that labeled as "news".</p>
<p>Free speech is alive ad well- but only as it applies to those entities with the biggest megaphones.  You and I (as well as every other individual) have few options to exchange views and ideas- most via corporate avenues... and they have a constitutional right to limit what is posted on their platforms the same way that we as individuals have a right to not allow certain types of things to be said within the privacy of our homes.</p>
<p>Much of what's going on now is a result of generations of preparation.  I've reached the point of wondering if freedom ever really existed.</p>

        <p>Hon, turn off the news. Distance yourself from toxic covid militant freaks. There is far more people thinking and feeling exactly the same as you, they're just now given the spotlight. </p>
<p>I know it won't make the situation go away but think of this as psychologal warfare. I think it is to an extent and it's what makes people crack and some lash out. No need to expose yourself to that. Fuck the rules, hug your loved ones, see your friends and try to do something about your future so you get a sense of purpose. Your life is precious and there are places that are putting a stop to this madness. Fleeing is an option.</p>

<p>You mean your immediate family? Or society? In either case I get it, you're probably one of these types of people who CAN'T ignore it and pretend it's not there. It's a rather large elephant in the room. 
If I may ask, pre covid, what did you want to do with your life? What made you happy and brought you joy?
 I know you don't wanna die, I can tell, but you want the pain to stop.</p>

        <p>I’m lucky enough to have an immediate family that doesn’t buy into the bullshit, but most of my extended family does. And society too of course is a big part of it</p>
<p>Before covid I was pretty depressed as well, but I still had plans in place for my future. Now it all just seems pointless. I want to go to school and get a degree but I struggle with online learning. I just want to go to school, live my life freely and be normal</p>
<p>Everything that brought me some joy has been taken away from me. Going out and being free to do as I please was my escape</p>

        <p>Online college can really suck balls and be hard as hell, don't blame you for just wanting to go in person. Maybe, just maybe, this next school year you might be able to. Until then maybe make smaller goals that you can achieve? And it don't even need to be school. Right now, something as simple as trying to have one good whole day could be a goal. Whatever you gotta do to make it happen, do it.</p>

        <p>But when there’s literal government mandates and lockdowns in place that force me to comply, then yes, people are controlling me</p>
<p>Canadian government is already talking about putting restrictions in place for unvaccinated people. Basically they’re going to force us to be vaccinated with an experimental vaccine, whether we want it or not. Because if you don’t get it you actually will have to spend the rest of your life at home. Forget about leaving the country ever again, or literally going anywhere but your kitchen and your bedroom</p>
<p>That’s what they want and it scares the fuck out of me. We’re living in 1984</p>

        <p>Nah, don’t kill yourself. That is what they want. They are actually trying to break people down so they give up. You are giving up, don’t do it! 
Hell is a state of mind but so is heaven. You do not have to let them kill you emotionally. You have more power than you think. 
They may have power over you physically but they don’t have power over your state of mind. Keep strong and keep going because we need everyone we can at this time on the side of freedom. This isn’t over yet!</p>

        <p>Don’t become a statistic. Things are awful, they have been for a year, and they probably will be for a while longer. Don’t show the permanent records that this shit meant anything to you. That’s something keeping me going. The suicide rate during lockdowns is 4-10x higher variable by country and I don’t want to show that this government mandated disease got the best of me. You’re young and you have a lot more to live for. Don’t let this get the best of you.</p>

        <p>Please don't kill yourself. There is light at the end of this tunnel. It's happening right now where I live at in Michigan and we have had it rough here with mandates and such. I've got issues like you do, and I make myself get up and take a walk down the damn road. Or, we hop in the car and go to the woods and walk (not since the snow tho). 
Please please please call the doc today and tell them you can't wait and need to be seen ASAP. And why. Don't hesitate to tell them why! Or, even go to the ER and tell them. You deserve the help. Don't hesitate getting it please.</p>

        <p>You're strong enough for at least still hanging in there, I'm a kratom user but I can't all the same stay sober through this either. The tension and sadness in the air is just too much now to go at raw. I feel pretty sick thinking about the near future. I have ptsd and the environment itself now has the almost exact looming feeling of dread and distrust as I was previously in. Everywhere has become an echo of it. The head games, the gaslighting, the victim blaming, it's got it all! I appreciate the smallest friendly unmasked interaction I have with someone outside untainted by it. The lack emotion and expression because of them is what is killing me with people the most. It falls on deaf senses now, what's the use of even trying to express emotion anymore? This year I really learned how important the whole face is to connecting with people. Most of the time under the mask I'm forced to at least where work is a tense frown anyways stressing the muscles. Some days it's hard to get through it and get home without any tears so I can get my dose and level my head out again rather quickly. Don't even get me started on the bs this has introduced into my relationships with people too.</p>
<p>What has helped though in keeping me mentally sustained lately is lions mane extract though, I recommend it to anyone trying to keep a clearer head and still have the energy to keep going now. Builds new neural networks and can make anyone more functional under the pressure. Once in the morning and a smaller amount later in the day.</p>

        <p>As someone who has problems reading people’s emotions, masks have been so damaging to my mind. I rely on facial expressions and reading lips. I always think everyone is mad at me because I genuinely can’t tell. It just makes me feel so alone and attacked for just existing/being myself. I’m lucky enough to not be deaf though I guess. I can’t even imagine how hard it must be for deaf people right now, no one gives a shit about them though right? Gotta save the 90 year old obese grandmas</p>
<p>I’ve been coping with alcohol. It’s destroying my liver but it’s the only thing keeping me sane right now. I’ve never drank so much in my entire life, I can’t stop because being sober is too painful. If I don’t die from suicide I’m going to die from my organs failing</p>

        <p>Hello fellow Canuck.</p>
<p>I feel your anger, as my wife and I have share the same discontent for our incompetent goverment,  fragile, weak, agreeable and obedient population that shame people for being critical thinking.</p>
<p>You are not alone.</p>
<p>Thank God for people like, Michelle Rempel Garner  Pierre Poilievre, I enjoy watching them blast Trudeau and the liberal goverment. Only sensible people with commonsense nowadays. </p>
<p>I read Denmark must banned AstraZeneca, meanwhile Canada is embracing it and will be offering it to the public and thevye just received shipments!  WTF?</p>
<p>My wife is in Poland, spending time with her dying father, an aggressive brain tumor and post chemotherapy. Outlook, not very optimistic. Let me tell you, her ARRIVECAN form will say "Quarantine at home" .. and the $3000 ticket that will be issued, I'll see them in court. We WILL NOT comply, and I wont have my wife staying at some hotel.</p>
<p>Cherish life, and your health. We take things for granted and our time here,  Make the best of what you have,  break down all barriers. And have a plan. work towards the future. Turn off the liberal sponsored news.  You dont need to see Dr. Tams mutant face anyway, or have propaganda shoved down your throat.</p>
<p>Ill leave you with one of my favorite quotes;</p>
<p>"“Only when we’ve freed ourselves of emotion can we be truly free. Only when you’re willing to sacrifice what you hold dearest.”</p>
<p>Please dont do anything to hurt yourself, put down the destructive alcohol. Work on yourself, mentally and physically please.</p>
<p>Dont let them win. Were here with you, silently for now.</p>

        <p>Alcohol exacerbates depression and CREATES SEVERE mental illness.</p>
<p>Read it again. It CREATES SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS WHERE THERE WAS NONE. HAVING MENTAL ILLNESS PLUS EXORBITANT ALCOHOL RUINS YOU.</p>
<p>Listen to me. Take a multivitamin, b complex, c, d3, lecithin, digestive enzymes and chromium picolinate daily to reverse the effects. They all play a massive role in reversing alcohols long term effects. </p>
<p>Jog as best you can for at least 10 minutes daily.</p>
<p>Eat healthy and sleep.</p>
<p>Do that for a week and your sense of hopelessness will lift. Do it and report back. I'm serious don't do anything stupid. We need more of us. Not less.</p>

        <p>don’t kill yourself. you can make it through this.</p>
<p>try to put down the booze. do you know your vitamin D, zinc levels? how’s your diet? are you exercising frequently? are you eating sufficient calories?</p>
<p>i <em>strongly</em> encourage you to engage with the world around you physically. this will make you feel much better. </p>
<p>also, consider literature. marcus aurelius, epictetus would be especially helpful. but good fiction too - you can escape from your outer world and explore the world someone created on the pages.</p>
<p>you aren’t alone. many, many people think like you but are too afraid to speak up.</p>
<p>you will make it. your thoughts and life matter.</p>

        <p>Thank you, I’m trying my best to get outside but it’s hard when there’s basically no place to go. Can’t even go to the park. I’ve been looking for some roller skates, hopefully I can get some as that would be a fun thing I can actually do. I’m happy winter is coming to end though, it’s been a dark dark time for me</p>

        <p>You said your family had broken up?   Same here. Things weren't great between a few of us before Covid but because they became extreme doomers that was the nail in the coffin. I am, for better or for worse, now estranged from two of my adult siblings. One was a psychotic bitch before Covid--but losing the other one makes me really sad.  At least I have my brother still. My parents have also gone full doomer.  </p>

We’re going to make it through this I promise you, and I want you around when that day comes. With glowing hearts we see the rise, the true North STRONG and FREE!</p>
<p>If you ever need a friendly anonymous stranger to vent to, then fire me a pm and I promise I’ll talk with you. You’re not alone.</p>

        <p>Keep going. I know exactly what it's like. I used to be really athletic but my football (soccer) has been postponed and cancelled time and again. I went from playing 5 times a week with training and matches to zero and now I'm just eating junk food and playing video games (I did that anyway lol but at least I was fit). </p>
<p>And I feel like I've got no future. All I wanted was to move to Japan after my degree and do all the fun shit I wanted to do but now with these vaccine passports and mandatory bullshit then that's off the table. And with no real future career prospects then I've let my degree slip. I'm so fucking furious at the state of this shite. I hate these fucking cunts man.</p>
<p>And as someone who was suicidal for so long, this tanked my mental health. But I won't do it. I won't. I'm not gonna do it. Because fuck them that's why. My life is about freedom above all else and I'll never give it up. Even when my options fall away, I'll never give it up. Even if I have to die defending my freedom. It just won't be at my hands.</p>
