    <strong>I really thought I had more time and I really didn't expect it to come to this</strong>
    <p><p>I've lived a comfortable life and even though I grew up very poor, I had a great family and was surrounded by love. I applied myself, worked extremely hard to self-teach myself enough skill for a decent pay work-from-home job in the tech sector. I've lived an innocent life, have always stood by the law, lived low-key and I don't drink or do drugs. I've always been a peaceful person, flying generally beneath the radar.</p>
<p>I not longer know how to process or handle what it going on around me. My government has lied to me and betrayed me over and over again. Covid passports and forced vaccinations are either almost or already here and I refuse to take it. I'm done wearing masks and I'm done distancing and following those damn arrows in shops.</p>
<p>Now, I feel astutely aware that my life may end far, far sooner than I had originally assumed, and that there may be substantial revolutionary conflict, if it should come to the unfortunate situation that the state starts coming for or segregating dissenters and their families. I don't want to live in a 1984 world.</p></p>
