    <strong>We've been ostracized by some of the larger anti-lockdown subs because we allow (and make) political posts. Sorry but covid is inherently a political movement masked as a public health crisis. It's been all politics for months regardless of country. Wasn't our choice!</strong>
    <p><p>It's obvious this is all political. In the U.S. it's being framed as a blue versus red issue. Similar situation in countries all over the world. But what's interesting is it can also be the opposite, i.e. in some countries the more conservative faction is pro-lockdown. This is all political and it's not even based on principles of liberalism/conservatism. It's about opportunistic power grabs and exploiting scapegoats. Different factions try to leverage "the crisis" to suit their agendas. This isn't a conspiracy theory. It's just raw politics and should be obvious to anyone not previously already heavily invested and indoctrinated in political bullshit.</p>
<p>We didn't make this about politics. But now it seems we have no choice but to engage in politics because that's how things change. This shouldn't be about liberalism/conservatism. This is about basic humanity and dignity. This isn't really a red vs. blue issue. It's being exploited. We need to form our own global anti-new normal coalition and wipe all of this nonsense out. </p>
<p>I don't know anything about political activism nor building political groups. Maybe someone else here does but we need to organize. We can't let our humanity be managed by unscrupulous assholes fighting over who gets to be more powerful for a few more years while we bear the brunt of the nonsense. Fuck them.</p>

        <p>Biden seems to disagree. He's confident he can help by mandating nationwide mask usage outside your house. Harris wants to establish a COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force. <a href="https://buildbackbetter.com/priorities/covid-19/">(src)</a></p>
<p>That sounds super helpful, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Oh, they're also going to use your tax dollars to hire 100,000 more people to "contract trace." That sounds like a great way to spend the next generation's money to me, doesn't it sound great to you?</p>
<p>But, if you still aren't sold on Biden saving you from the 'rona, let me drop the final bomb on you:</p>
<p>&rt;Stand up a Pandemic Testing Board like Roosevelt’s War Production Board.  It’s how we produced tanks, planes, uniforms, and supplies in record  time, and it’s how we will produce and distribute tens of millions of  tests.</p>
<p>So he'll just take over some of the nation's manufacturing capabilities and use it to make tests, in apparently a similar fashion to Roosevelt's efforts for that whole "world war" thingymajig we had a while back. No big deal, I'm sure.</p>

        <p>It’s not a straw man. Trumps played more golf than any other president. When he golfs at his own resorts, the money is going directly to him. Last I checked, Obama doesn’t own Hawaii and didn’t profit from visiting.</p>

        <p>You’re intentionally missing the point. Of course travel isn’t free. Travel isn’t the issue, presidents have a right to travel and they need a break too. The issue is Trump directly profiting from taxpayer dollars when he golfs at his own resorts.</p>

        <p>I'm not intentially missing anything. The issue wouldn't be his cost per round which is probably zero, its the cost associated with his security detail, which has been covered ad nauseum with previous presidents. Again, this is nothing new or unique.</p>

        <p>Aside from Social-distancing and mask-wearing, contact tracing is literally one of the only active measures we can take until a vaccine is released. Attempting to limit the outbreak that’s currently killing &rt;1000 Americans every day seems like a reasonable use of taxpayer dollars to me, yes. Everyone hates on the active measures until they know someone who died or got damaged by it - it’s classic availability bias. America needs more compassion right now, not more cynicism.</p>

<p>Hiring 100,000 people, even part time at 20 hrs/week, is 2 million hours per week. 8 million hours of human labor a month. Assuming the extremely conservative estimate of their wages and benefits and the overhead costs of the program coming in at $25/hr, that's $200,000,000 per month.</p>

        <p>So, about .075% of 2017’s total income
tax collected for a 6 month effort. If that results in American lives saved, seems like a patriotic and compassionate thing to do. Not even factoring in things like the cost of a depleted job market that hinges on the pandemic getting more under control. I won’t dispute the likely inefficiencies of a government run tracing effort, and I absolutely think we should have a more modern strategy (like smartphone apps), but raising my taxes by .75% (generous considering successfully controlling outbreaks could result in significant growth to the economy) for one year seems reasonable. I did the math on my taxes, and would happily pay that much for a chance to save American lives, provide jobs for 100k unemployed, support our struggling healthcare workforce, and protect our infrastructure from further damage. If sacrificing the fruit of ones labor to save the lives and livelihoods of Americans isn’t patriotic, what is?</p>

        <p>You have no basis for any of those numbers. For all you know he's paying a private third party to hire contract workers with the majority making minimum wage. </p>
<p>He could be reassigning a small chunk of the 2 million federal employees in the US to the "task force". </p>
<p>And let's say you're right. Biden wants to create <strong>100,000 jobs</strong> that pay <strong>$25/hr</strong> into the broken US economy? That could have a net positive impact on the economy despite whatever fantasized tax increases you are implying.</p>

        <p>&rt; And let's say you're right. Biden wants to create <strong>100,000 jobs</strong> that pay <strong>$25/hr</strong> into the broken US economy? That could have a net positive impact on the economy  </p>
<p>Well why not shoot for the moon? Let's make it 200,000 jobs. 1,000,000 jobs even.. 10 is better than one, right? Hahaha.</p>

        <p>I find that ridiculous, too. As if Trump weren't president the US would have no deaths or severely less deaths, at least that's what is being implied. Meanwhile here in europe there is no Trump or anyone similar to him and yet shit is more or less the same.</p>

        <p>Oh you can bet your bottom dollar that if Trump hadn't been president then they would have largely ignored it and the number of deaths would have been similar to H1N1, because no one would have been counting cases and padding death toll. Either that or they would have acted like the virus never got a hold in this country...acted like they stopped it back in February.</p>

        <p>Or because it’s been almost a year 😂 you trump but buddies do remember trump promises a vaccine by Election Day?😂😂😂😂 get off his dick, no he didn’t “personally” kill anyone,  the way he has acted has given people justification to go out and do what they want, no obeying Covid rules or even wearing a fucking mask. Witch this is all trumps fault, he clearly didn’t take this serious, or BLM. He was more worried about getting re-elected then saving people. He got private treatment when he was sick and then watched the world suffer lol. He is a Lil dick, failing businessmen. Who told lies and lies for 4 years. Didn’t do shit, and all you ooompa loompa lovers still pray for this man like he actually did something good 😂 this isn’t on “us” it’s on America to shut down fucking bars and stupid ass places no one should even be.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the seriousness and professionalism embraced by /r/LockdownSkepticism, however, labeling us as a conspiracy sub and taking us off the sidebar was a stupid move. We have a lot more open discussion than Lockdownskepticism, we also tend to have a much more extreme position against the new normal. This has always been the case, and I think the the other sub is being unreasonable and perhaps even snooty to act out towards us this way.</p>
<p>I've honestly not seen a difference in quality from when this sub started to now.</p>

        <p>I've noticed it looks like a single mod over there is quick to call everything they don't agree with a conspiracy even if there's fairly well documented support for the position. The same mod shuts down any and all criticism of the left while constantly attacking anyone on the right.</p>
<p>In general it seems a few of their mods have let their power go to their heads and are ironically acting like the government officials the sub was created to oppose.</p>

        <p>I was 24-hour banned from r/LockdownSkepticism for saying I was going to a Trump rally - in the context of "I can finally be surrounded by people who have similar opinions regarding lockdown."  While that sub saved me in so many ways, and I'm glad to see bipartisan support for ending lockdowns, I fear that sub is at risk for turning into almost every other subreddit - ostracizing conservatives.</p>

        <p>To be fair, I don't think they entirely know what they do. I think they're humans who run on instinct, like us, and their instinct leads them to pursue power at all costs. Power does indeed corrupt. And that corruption only spreads, like rust or rot.</p>

Though you're correct that they heavily try to avoid being labeled as "conspiracy theorists", but I find it a little ridiculous that saying that this is politically motivated is considered a conspiracy theory.

        <p>What a bunch of clowns. Honestly, only go to that sub so I can find links to scientific articles and anti-lockdown pieces. I have long since figured out that the sub is populated by a bunch of people who are clearly ruffled by any criticism of their political party...and needless to say we all know which party that is. I'm also sick of the kowtowing and cognitive dissonance. The mods on that sub make no secret of how they are pro-mask, a position that literally makes no sense with all the tons of facts evidence out there that cover the topic of mask and why those who oppose lockdowns should oppose them to...as they are part and parcel of the hideous, psychotic response to this virus, and the Orwellian novel become real life aspect of it all...the "science is what the anointed ones day it is"...how everything got rewritten literally overnight (and not just about masks, but everything else about viruses and epidemiology) and everyone just accepted it. And scientists that went against it got actively ridiculed, dismissed and ultimately silenced.</p>

        <p>It's honestly incredible that on LDS you cannot point out how it's republicans that are anti-lcokdown and how tribal and hypocritical pro-lockdown democrats are.  </p>
<p>We are literally being told not to see our loved ones at christmas while people are dancing and celebrating in the street in crowds of hundreds of thousands. It's only one political party being THAT arrogant and hypocritical.  </p>
<p>And you have to be able to talk about the liberal "I am virtuous you are bad, no I could never be a bad or 1000x worse, yes I'm having a gathering 1000x bigger than people going to a bar or having a haircut, no it doesn't count as granny killing, because a few of us wore masks, ignore people sharing drinks and screamng and taking off their cloth masks"  </p>
<p>It's absurd that you cannot talk about what you see in front of your eyes there.  </p>
<p>The amount of times someone will bite off your head and go "HEY IT'S NOT DEMOCRATS FAULT"  </p>

        <p>It's infuriating how on that sub they still think the government and media- anointed quacks aka "experts" are speaking science and that they are just doing what they believe will fight this virus and this is all due to their great knowledge of science. Like, "oh epidemiologists know how diseases work, they just don't know how the economy works". </p>
<p>What kind of cognitive dissonance from hell is that shit? How can you be against lockdowns yet still believe any part of this psychotic response is remotely based in science? Or that anyone with an advanced degree could be that clueless about how the economy and society work? How can you truly be that clueless to believe there's nothing nefarious going on, and they these "experts" just have "good intentions"? </p>
<p>How can you actually believe that they believe a word of their own lies and quackery? Ask yourself would any of this be accepted at any epidemiological conference last year, or would it have gotten laughed out of the room? Remember how Saint Fauci himself was saying something completely different back in February...gee, back then he actually sounded like a real scientist! The past eight months he and all the others who shill for the narrative including the WHO and CDC, have shot their credibility to hell, have put a permanent stain upon science, they just don't care because they know people are too dumb to put two and two together and they can get away with it. I completely agree that this is gaslighting and psychological warfare to the extreme.</p>
<p>What was absurd nine months ago is now accepted by the masses as truth and logic. They have no memory of life and the world prior to March 2020. Like you said, you can see it all with your own eyes but they will tell you that you didn't see anything and that one and one make three. Are we living in Orwell's <em>1984</em> yet or what?</p>

        <p>I knew they were clichey and high minded there when I saw that I would have a post removed and then it would only be approved based on the moderator wantig to micromanage what I say in it.  </p>
<p>And one time a post was removed, they said "oh someone already posted about that".  </p>
<p>And then I saw someone made the exact same post later but said a little less.  </p>
<p>They do micromanage posts and remove them based on excuses if they don't like your style.  </p>
<p>It was literally a text post discussing the welsh and scottish lockdowns but when someone else made the post <em>after</em> me then they allowed it, it showed they just sit there navel gazing and micromanaging exact posts, going for a certain <em>style.</em>  </p>
<p>It's not even like I made conspiracy conjectures, they are just snooty about what they approve at times, not surprised they have a fart-huffing whatsapp group.</p>

        <p>Agreed.  If various social media keep practicing obvious censorship they risk the creation of competitors that do not and people leaving to join them.   I don't engage in a communication channel to be limited in what I can talk about.  That isn't communication.</p>

        <p>The problem with this agreeable insight is, that since it's political, you've got a lot of people actively or passively agreeing with "the other side", and "our side" is the extreme minority. People are being told that there is a deadly virus out there, and that we need to lockdown and do a bunch of assorted, rain-dance like shamanic procedures to completely avoid risks and death.</p>
<p>There's a lot of people out there throughout all demographics who want to completely avoid risks. To tell them that some risks are unavoidable and everyone is going to die eventually anyway holds no political water.</p>
<p>The precedent has been set, the global response to a minor health risk has been established, signed and stamped, and it will all but go away. A so to say "hedonistic risk-affine" political party will fail by design in these times. It will always be a minority, and it didn't take a pandemic to expose this. People are gullible cowards.</p>

<p>This is why the founding fathers tried to protect us from outright democracy, which is inherently flawed.</p>
<p>Just because 51% vote for something, does not mean it is right, moral, correct, just, or wise.</p>
<p>The constitution was supposed to protect us from democracy. It did a better job than any other document man has ever created. I hold out some small hope that it can be maintained and preserved and our Constitutional Republic can survive.</p>

        <p>I disagree somewhat. People are afraid because the news, social media and politicians have spread as much fear as they can. We need to spread an alternative message. We don't need a majority to accomplish that just a well funded and focused minority might do. A sub reddit isn't going to be sufficient exposure. We need a professionally managed PR campaign with global reach.</p>

        <p>Well sorry if this again sounds defeatist, but good luck competing with a established, highly effective, multi billion dollar global propaganda machine which will out-propaganda you every time in a heartbeat. They already did that with some of the highest credentialed and knowledgeable scientists in the world.</p>
<p>All you need is the people on your side. And that happens when they lose their house, their job, their security, their stability, that happens when their finances are screwed basically, not their freedoms. No broke, hungry man cares about virtue signalling, mask wearing and other mandate obedience. So if I were a cynic, which I probably am, I'd say lean back and enjoy the show.</p>

        <p>I have been mostly leaning back. I started this sub and have been moderating and posting but that isn't doing enough. I thought existing politics would sort this all out but it's clear to me that isn't going to happen sooner vs. later. We've built a little following and some momentum but we need to keep going. </p>
<p>Their message is fear. Fear of the virus. Fear of living life. Fear of one another. No one wants to keep listening to that shit. People want to listen to a better message but no one is selling it. While I applaud efforts like the Great Barrington Declaration, I think they're missing the mark PR-wise.</p>

        <p>First, thank you for starting and moderating this sub, it's a lighthouse of sanity, and therapeutic not just for me but probably for all of those who come here.</p>
<p>You say their message is fear. Now what is the opposite of fear? Of course it's hope. We would need to define what that means. What message and promise of hope is strong enough to counteract and trump their message of fear? What message can undermine and dissolve the animalistic panic they fuel, we are all going to die, hospitals are full, triage, disease, collapse? That's a very strong message, psychologically speaking, it's hard to break it and counter it, since we are animals that don't want to die. And they are basically making death threats to global societies. You can't tell someone to look at the beautiful flowers over there when he has a loaded gun to his forehead. If we come up with a message stronger than a death threat, I'm game.</p>

        <p>You show people who are dying right now because of the lockdowns. The most powerful thing I've seen so far is an older woman in a care facility suffering from dementia and crying because she wasn't able to hug her son on the other side of the glass. Instead of vague threats of death and suffering we can show actual death and suffering.</p>

        <p>Alright. Fair point.</p>
<p>So counterterrorism it is. Let's think about it, because that's a strong strategy, muy bien.</p>
<p>A lot of people wonder about this pandemic because they don't know anyone personally who got sick let alone died. All they see is the daily dashboard and numbers, numbers, numbers of "cases", they see the increasingly deserted inner cities, they see closed and boarded up venues, they watch TV and never see actual footage of mass death and illness, at least not anymore. The "postcard from Bergamo" has expired. The mass graves in NYC have faded. Life, seemingly, and contrary to what they see on TV, goes on ordinarily after all.</p>
<p>Now that's the point where we could gain leverage. It's NOT going on for this father who had to bury his teenage son because a 14 year old decided to take his own life out of desperation and hopelessness. It doesn't go on for those who starve in Colombia and who die because their medical treatment is unavailable. It doesn't go on for this man, who once was a successful business owner and recovered alcoholic, who now descended into homelessness and despair because the government closed his business and his support group. It doesn't go on for this old lady who wants to say goodbye to her daughter, because she feels she's dying and wants human contact one last time. It doesn't go on for those newborns whose urgently needed medical interventions are denied because of arbitrary regulation due to a flu virus.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>

        <p>Thank you for creating this sub.</p>
<p>There are subs with less chaos and more stringent control of posts. There are subs that pick their battles (lockdownskeptism doesn't talk about masks) for better or for worse.</p>
<p>I think what makes this sub so great is people get fired up. There are many passionate people here who know this is bullshit. If a protest breaks out in our city, we will be primed and ready.. and that is what we need - numbers. We are passionate people also aren't scared about spreading the word.</p>
<p>This sub brings awareness.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't worry about the bigger sub. The mods there seem to think masks have nothing to do with lockdown and everyone that doesn't believe politicians are just innocently misguided is a conspiracy theorist. They'll literally ignore the fact that many prominent people are admitting it will never go back to normal, they ignore ID2020, the Great Reset, the Rockefeller's Lock Step, etc and if you bring them up you're a conspiracy theorist. They think it's fine that the politicians are now ignoring the WHO's advice to not lockdown again, and ignoring (if not outright covering up) the actual fatality rate/statistics. I actually think the people over there that believe the politicians are just working through ignorance are more conspiracy theorists than people who can see it for what it is: A disgusting power grab by people who are willingly surrounding themselves with Yes Man. All you have to do is look at England continuing with their second lockdown despite the graphs being reissued. They know full well what they're doing.</p>

        <p>The only obvious thing I see to do is raise money. We need commercials, internet ads, print ads, all of that stuff which all takes money. We probably need some sort of political action committee status in various countries in order to manage these funds and deal with the tax implications etc.</p>
<p>Have you set up a political action committee before? Is that the right vehicle for this sort of thing?</p>
<p>We also need our fund raising and expenditures to be completely transparent. I think we could probably use a publicly auditable cryptocurrency's blockchain to track our funds. Having accountants that are familiar with this stuff would probably help.</p>
<p>We likely also need lawyers. We need to figure out how to operate legally everywhere we need to be. If we raise enough money, in addition to advertising, we could go on the offense in courts. </p>
<p>If this goes on long enough we may eventually need to finance political campaigns for elected office.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: We really need a well funded professionally managed PR campaign with global reach. We have to keep our core message short and palatable to all existing ideologies. Focus on our humanity and dignity. So we also need creatives.</p>

        <p>I agree but I fear that it will never be allowed to gain traction.  Facebook won’t allow it, television won’t allow it so where are we going to show it?  They likely would pull down posters in the town square so I’m not sure what we could do.</p>

        <p>This whole COVID situation only proves to me how necessary - and ultimately inevitable - mass decentralization is. All governments and corporations grow corrupt as they amass power, all nations grow unstable as the population grows larger and more diverse. Indeed, this is far beyond left vs right, USA vs CCP, any national boundary or party line. The corruption of government officials and corporate executives knows no bounds. Sadly, this isn't just some conspiracy. This is human nature. The social cycle.</p>

<p>There's a growing movement for a "<a href="https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/the-new-tea-party-is-rising-libertarians-pay-attention/">Tea Party 2.0</a>" in the Republican Party which would be more explicitly pro-liberty including taking a stronger stance against lockdowns and mandates.

        <p>is it wrongthink here to believe that this was a plandemic? seems awful coincidental to have occurred right before what we are told is the most consequential presidential election in us history. it's all so convenient for the left--the pro lockdown/mask/control party.</p>

        <p>IMO, it's almost irrelevant to the immediate issue. Whether planned, accidentally released, or Randy Marsh fucked an infected pangolin while on vacation in China, we're still dealing with the same lockdowns, masks and business restrictions. We can fight that nonsense without even dealing with the original cause of the virus.</p>

        <p>Honestly I don’t mind the “other sub’s” stance. Frankly the lockdowns shouldn’t make sense no matter your position on healthcare, economic policy etc, and unfortunately some people once they see that trump supports X, they are against X. As a example in the last election, it’s my personal belief that people voted for or against Trump, not “for” Biden per se. In order to get the most number of people against lockdown policy, making it as apolitical makes sense to me. </p>
<p>That said, discussing political policies and candidate stances is important, as is unfiltered views, which is why this sub and to some extent the circlejerk one exists. I wish they would keep the sidebar links, but what’s done is done. </p>
<p>TL;DR: both subs have their niche.</p>

        <p>I like that sub as a database for our stance on lockdowns, but discussion for the bigger picture is much more welcome here. I don't think our leaders are so inept not to see the devastating effects of the lockdowns after 9 months. Compiling all the facts isn't enough to turn this around. If it was, we would have been back to normal already. The politics surrounding this are undeniable.</p>
<p>Implying that something nefarious is going on does not make us conspiracy theorists. We are critical thinkers too, but on a deeper level. I'm with you on organizing. We need to influence the culture and make being a free thinker cool again.</p>

        <p>https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism is part of the problem. And I’m not a conspiracy theorist - at all.</p>
<p>But pretending politics doesn’t affect this is laughable. They are just a bunch of professors patting themselves on the back without doing a god damn thing to change anything. Anything meaningful is disallowed. They just want academic articles about what a shame lockdowns are. I mean; they are academics, so I guess it’s to be expected. I’m glad this sub exists and I’ll sift through conspiracy theories in exchange for less censorship.</p>

        <p>Humble brag, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ip41px/postelection_predictions/">I called this.</a> But you explained it much better and added a missing piece, that it's not necessarily the US election itself that's driving it. Though it's possible the election was necessary to jumpstart this phenomenon worldwide. Luckily for Americans, the air feels different, like reopening is imminent.</p>

        <p>I think it appears to be political but it isn't.</p>
<p>I know many anti masker anti lockdown folks who can't stand trump and I know trump lovers that want masks 'for our safety'.</p>
<p>Another example is Doug Ford in Ontario. He is a Conservative and he is absolutely insane for lockdowns and masks.</p>
<p>Politicizing this is just another way to divide us.</p>

        <p>It is serious, that’s why every person should start actively boosting their immune system through cardio workouts and taking dietary supplements. Only people who need to quarantine are those who are immunocompromised. Otherwise open everything and masks are optional cause they largely are bullshit.</p>
