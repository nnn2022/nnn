    <strong>The people that got vaccinated have too much to lose by admitting the whole thing is a sham.</strong>
    <p><p>The people that have revolved their life around this plandemic and have constantly preached unto others about doing the right thing are too afraid to lose face and come out as being manipulated for the past 2 years. They will never come out and say that they allowed their body to be violated by big pharmaceutical as it would make them lose respect for themselves. They will drive this country into the ground before they will ever admit that they could possibly be wrong.</p></p>
