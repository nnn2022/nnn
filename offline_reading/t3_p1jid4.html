    <strong>Segregation is in full swing now</strong>
    <p><p>I just got banned in "worldnews" for responding to a mockery post against Anti-Vaxxers, which of course was really anti-experimental science vaccinations.</p>
<p>Post:</p>
<p>"What's even funnier is that there is a group of people out there who after over a year and half still believe there's a pandemic even though mathematically and scientifically it's impossible.</p>
<p>It took 70 days from the first death to the 25,000th death in the US. To achieve this the death rate would have been 2% and the the r factor a 3. At this rate, the entirety of the US would have been completed exposed, infected and / dead within 3 months. If one might argue that the death rate was lower, well since death rate and infection rate are inversely proportional, the US would have reached infection saturation even sooner. Then one could examine the origin, and based on international and domestic travel, to achieve infection within 20 countries in less than 2 months, the r factor would have been 6, and the entirety of the east coast of Asia would have been decimated long before any "lockdowns" would have taken place...</p>
<p>No source for math, just simple grade 9 statistical probability calculations lololol...</p>
<p>As for scientifically, RNA viruses break down through mutation becasue they are only single stranded they do not have what you would call a checksum to ensure it's stability and therefore they just simply get weaker over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000003">https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000003</a></p>
<p>Not only that these same people are willing to inject themselves with a completely experimental science that has a horrifying track record in animals made by companies who have paid out millions in lawsuits and being promoted by people who have formerly claimed a drug will cure a disease, however it was lethal.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wxD2w_AQCg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wxD2w_AQCg</a></p>
<p>And to market this pandemic they have now resorted to the Greek alphabet to ensure it's continuity...Just wait until Omega, then you know it's doomsday for sure!</p>
<p>Oh and as for the source provided by the OP, could you imagine if an "anti vaxxer" used the same source? I can hear the ridicule resonating...lol...Don't you love double standards and hypocrisy. Make sure to do some resurch lol...</p>
<p>Good Luck and Cheers!" </p>
<p>So although they were completely mocking anti covid vaxxers in this thread, I was banned for:</p>
<p>"You have been banned for posting content that downplays or mocks necessary public health measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic, such as taking vaccines or wearing masks in the comments section. Such comments violate this subreddit's rule against offensive content and reddit's guidelines on misinformation."</p>
<p>However, I provided evidence and links to support my argument and the only response they could conjure up was that I was mentally ill. They are permitted to mock, ridicule and even condemn the lives of those who oppose the science despite  any degree of evidence. </p>
<p>We are being herded and silenced. They allow us to express our views but the only to the equivalent of a controlled opposition, whereby we may do so only in designated areas. If you do not realize, this is a form of conditioning, whereby we resign ourselves to complacency and operate within our allowable parameters. This is a very scary prospect for our future. Ironically, even if they are in the minority, this type of censorship creates the illusion of being part of the majority and it will spread becasue people fear rejection and ridicule therefore if they feel their beliefs account for only a small segment they will assimilate to the popular belief system.</p>
<p>People better rise up soon with some conviction.</p>
<p>Take Care all!</p></p>

        <p>The fact that a company can pay a 3 billion dollar fine and still be in business boggles the mind.</p>
<p>Also, what I've come to learn moderating here is that these people keep repeating that word and it's kind of lost the original meaning so when they say misinformation you can replace that with "thought crime" or "wrong think" more than half the time.  It's pretty weird because at first I thought they were fucking with me.</p>
