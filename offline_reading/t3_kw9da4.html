    <strong>Online dating during this plandemic: did you ever get blocked / rejected because of your views on it?</strong>
    <p><p>Happened twice to me. </p>
<p>First time, I mentioned meeting up and she went something like, '<em>yes, as long as we follow the public health recommendations</em>'. I don't remember what I said, but she asked '<em>so you don't think it's important to save lives?</em>'. Then I proceeded to mention the numerous collateral damages triggered these insane restrictions. The depressions, bankruptcies, mental health issues, suicides / etc. Right away, she unmatched me without arguing. A NPC I guess.</p>
<p>Second one: I mentioned something about <em>back in the days when we could go in a public setting without wearing a disguise</em> (a mask in this case). She got defensive and went '<em>you're against masks?</em>'. I mentioned my skepticism about the whole thing because we were told early on that they were completely useless. And I told her it was cruel to force kids to wear them all day long, many of them developing headaches from them.</p>
<p>She went all passive-aggressive on me. <em>Yeah, sure, you're an expert." / </em>If you think this way, I don't think we're a fit*.</p>
<p>People are really f*cking stupid. Seriously.</p></p>
