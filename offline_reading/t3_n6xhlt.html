    <strong>GMO mosquitoes in Texas and Florida and possible link to infertility</strong>
    <p><p>There has been some speculation about the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines potentially causing infertility in women with some potentially anecdotal evidence of women having <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9495727/Researchers-studying-women-report-changes-periods-taking-COVID-vaccine.html">infrequent or no periods</a> after receiving a vaccine leading to a <a href="https://redcap.healthinstitute.illinois.edu/surveys/index.php?s=LL8TKKC8DP">formal study</a> on the matter. </p>
<p>While a direct link to these alleged irregular cycles to a covid vaccine remains to be explicitly proven, I believe I have found a potentially cataclysmic threat to all female mRNA vaccine recipients. </p>
<p>For those unaware, the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA-HQ-OPP-2019-0274-0359">EPA has approved</a> (direct link to EPA approval) the release of <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/06/22/opinion/before-genetically-modified-mosquitoes-are-released-we-need-better-epa/">a billion genetically modified mosquitos</a> in Houston Texas and the Florida Keys to allegedly combat <a href="https://www.oxitec.com/en/news/oxitecs-friendly-mosquito-technology-receives-us-epa-approval-for-pilot-projects-in-us">yellow and dengue fever</a>, a disease that is almost nonexistent in both areas. </p>
<p>The planned method by which this will be done is by using genetically modified male <em>Ae. aegypti</em> mosquitos. In this particular species of mosquito (that are extremely common in both Florida and Texas), the female is the one that bites people, potentially infecting people with a disease, because they need a blood meal too produce eggs. The male GM mosquitos will carry a specific gene that, after mating with females, will cause <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/mosquito-control/community/sit/genetically-modified-mosquitoes.html">female mosquito offspring to die before reaching adulthood</a>. From the article: </p>
<p>&rt;GM male mosquito eggs that carry the self-limiting gene are released into an area. Once they have hatched and develop through to the adult stage, they are available to mate with wild females. The genes are passed on to offspring.
&rt;
&rt;The female offspring die before they become adults. As a result, the number of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in the area decreases </p>
<p>The body that has developed these genetically modified organisms is a British company called <a href="https://www.oxitec.com/en/news/oxitecs-friendly-mosquito-technology-receives-us-epa-approval-for-pilot-projects-in-us">Oxitec</a> that has received a total of $8,473,233 from none other than the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants?q=Oxitec">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> over the last 3 years, including a grant for $1,283,287 in 2021. </p>
<p>While the release of a billion genetically modified organisms into an ecosystem should already set off alarm bells for anyone with a brain, the situation is potentially much more dangerous than just food cycle disruption... </p>
<p>Moderna (who, coincidentally, has also received a <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/ecosystem/strategic-collaborators/foundations-advancing-mrna-science-and-research">$20 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>), has developed an mRNA vaccine that, according to them, is akin to an <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/mrna-platform-enabling-drug-discovery-development">"operating system"</a> that is designed to: </p>
<p>&rt;[...]plug and play interchangeably with different programs. <strong>In our case, the "program” or “app” is our mRNA drug - the unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein.</strong> </p>
<p>This mRNA technology is used as a way to make the body produce proteins specified by the so called instruction set "uploaded" into the host. However, according to the Moderna website previously linked: </p>
<p>&rt;<strong>We also have the ability to combine different mRNA sequences encoding for different proteins in a single mRNA investigational medicine.</strong> </p>
<p>Now that all the facts have been clearly laid out and established, it's time for some speculation...is it possible that human males that have the mRNA operating system who get bitten by female infected mosquitoes develop a protein that can mimic the same effect in humans? Can these genetically modified female mosquitos that have been infected with a gene that kills their offspring before they can procreate can be a new "instruction set" that can be processed by this mRNA technology in human females? </p>
<p>This is in no way conclusive, I am merely posing the question; if we have the ability to control and reduce the population of mosquitos using genetic modification, how much of a stretch is it to assume it could be done to humans as well?</p></p>
