        <p>I wonder if De Santis could now get the legislature to come for a special session.</p>
<p>I think the Republicans in the legislature weren't willing to have a special session two weeks ago because they thought that only blue counties would require masks, and their kids wouldn't be subject to this.</p>
<p>However, now Lee County and Bay County have mandated masks for teachers and required students to wear masks unless they get a parental opt out.   Frankly, that's probably just a stop gap measure before they require masks and don't allow opt outs. And Lee and Bay Counties were both won by Trump by more than 20 points. There's also a lot of pressure to mandate masks in schools (or at the very least require opt outs)  in St. John's County, which went to Trump by 26 points.</p>
<p>In order to get the special session, the vote of all 24 Republicans in the Senate are needed.</p>
