    <strong>Walmart experience with no mask</strong>
    <p><p>Being in MD, Hogan came out on Friday and said he was lifting the mask mandate for all, but he said companies could still do it, i was kinda annoyed about that because my boss told me we still had to wear them. One of my co workers told me that our local Costco and Giant lifted the masks and i was like "yes!". I went to Walmart after work to get my weekly supply of food and i had my mask just incase, but there was no sign on the entrance about the masks, So i went to someone that works there and i said if we still had to wear masks. He told me, If you dont want to, we wont have a problem with that. So i was thrilled and i didnt have a mask on the whole being in there. The thing is, everyone else was still wearing them and it felt so weird that i was the only one not wearing one. Part of me was hoping someone say something to me about not wearing a mask so i could go " Well someone up front said it was okay :)" </p>
<p>Its such a liberating feeling, im jealous that FL and TX has had these feeling for a while now.</p></p>

        <p>The only criticism I will offer: don't ask.</p>
<p>I get the fear of confrontation, but you aren't going to accidentally go viral if you put it on when asked (especially if there are signs up).</p>
<p>Went to a local liquor store yesterday - big mask pushers/enforcers the whole time - sign had changed to "recommended."</p>
<p>I was one of two in the semi-crowded store not doing it. I am trying to be the example.</p>
<p>Rip the door off its hinges. Go back to normal and dont let them take it back!</p>

        <p>Also in MD, but just got denied service from a business because I wasn't wearing a mask. It's BS that Hogan made businesses follow the mask mandates under penalty even if they didn't want to, but now he's allowing businesses to deny service at will and not follow the recent mask lifting mandate that he ordered.</p>

        <p>yeah, it makes no sense. Tho i would point out i think the more time goes on, the more clear that i think people will not go to a business if they require masks because other stores are not enforcing it. The thing is, if someone wants to keep wearing a mask, thats perfectly fine; but its insane to me a business would still want their customers and employees to wear a mask even when they arent legally forced to do so anymore.</p>

        <p>Don’t be jealous of Fl. I am usually the only person without a mask in a store . I walked the entire mall in April without one. Maybe 5 others were unmasked.. the rest wear it, even as chin straps just so they fit in.. No one says anything but every large store still has gate keepers.</p>

        <p>Of course this comment is downvoted. Of course.</p>
<p>I swear, the people here are so ignorant about what FL is really like right now. Most people still wear masks everywhere even outside.</p>

        <p>Went to Costco in Washington today. The sign as still up and outdated but I walked in no mask. They made a public announcement, it’s not my fault the store has up old signs. But no one said a word. Only saw 2 other groups without. It was weird at first, but by the end I was so happy to have a choice again. I plan on not wearing a mask unless asked from now on.</p>

        <p>I went into ARCO afterwards. They had a sign up but I decided to walk in massless anyways. No one said a word. I’m comfortable now “forgetting” since rules are now mixed.</p>
