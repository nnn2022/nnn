    <strong>I‚Äôm scared to share my opinions and stand up for myself out of fear of losing my job.</strong>
    <p><p>I have a separate Reddit account I use often but I made a new one because I‚Äôm afraid my employer knows about it. I live north of Los Angeles in a nice area. My husband and I have acreage and a nice house away from people. I work closer to Los Angeles at an accounting firm. I‚Äôm a CPA but I‚Äôm only 21 so I haven‚Äôt established my own firm yet. My husband is a CPA too and works at the same firm. Anyways, we often do work for very wealthy people and celebrities. We get paid very well and have good benefits, so you can see why I don‚Äôt want to get fired.</p>
<p>My boss is very liberal. At the beginning of covid he offered everyone to work from home but we didn‚Äôt have to if we didn‚Äôt want to. Almost everyone decided to ‚Äúwork‚Äù from home but my husband and I kept working in the office. Eventually everyone came back and there were so bratty and pissed off that they actually had to come back. Masks are optional and almost everyone wears one. My husband and I share an office so of course we don‚Äôt wear them. My coworkers have been getting really into the mask thing and often tell me to wear one. It‚Äôs getting close to verbal abuse. I‚Äôm so scared to say anything. One of my coworkers called me a bitch and my husband yelled at him then the dude didn‚Äôt come back to work for three days.</p>
<p>What amazes me is how pathetic these people look. The men in my office are just losers, they‚Äôre very liberal, and to be a bit controversial, Jewish. My husband is more conservative and he‚Äôs pretty. He‚Äôs Australian and he‚Äôs very tall and built and muscular. He looks like a real man whereas these pro lockdown guys are just pussies. Fuck I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a universal rule but it‚Äôs a pattern myself and other users on here are picking up on. </p>
<p>Jesus I know this got off topic but goddamnit I‚Äôm scared of losing my job. I want to leave but we get paid too damn well. We want to move soon. Politics aside, I love California. I don‚Äôt want to leave but I know leaving is for the best. Las Vegas is probably where we‚Äôre headed.</p></p>

        <p>&rt; The men in my office are just losers, they‚Äôre very liberal and to be a bit controversial, Jewish. </p>
<p>OP, including that objectively irrelevant fact isn‚Äôt ‚Äúa bit controversial‚Äù - <strong>it‚Äôs blatantly anti-Semitic.</strong> </p>
<p>Confirmation of your anti-Semitism quickly follows, when you contrast those ‚Äúloser Jews‚Äù with your ‚Äúconservative, pretty Australian husband‚Äù who ‚Äúlooks like a real man.‚Äù Of course, you‚Äôre not claiming it‚Äôs a pattern ... you‚Äôre just saying it‚Äôs a pattern you (and unspecified others) ‚Äúare picking up on.‚Äù </p>
<p>I‚Äôve been opposed to lockdowns and masks and social distancing from quite literally Day 1, based on both available evidence and my personal values. I know plenty of Jews who share my views, and plenty who don‚Äôt; that split in opinion can be readily observed in any group you care to name: liberals, Christians, atheists, men, women, etc. </p>
<p>The fact that you‚Äôve allegedly noticed a ‚Äúpattern‚Äù in an insular, unrepresentative environment tells us nothing of significance... other than that you have very weak logical reasoning skills. </p>
<p><strong>As a Jew, I cordially invite you to fuck right off with your anti-Semitic hate-mongering.</strong></p>

        <p>While I agree with the sentiment that people on the conservative spectrum feel the need to be more quiet (I feel the same in a lot of situations), I'm having trouble believing what's truthful in your post as it would be very difficult to be a CPA in the state of California at 21.  Pretty impressive that you got the 150 academic credit hours with undergrad degree and one year of applicable experience by the time you were 21 in order to be a CPA....</p>

        <p>Yes.  This.  I've been saying this a lot lately.  I don't know why it has taken me so long to realize that the liberals use the government to make things go away so their feelings don't get hurt anymore.  What a waste of time.....and time is money.</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt like to tell people not stand up for their beliefs but losing a job right now would not be good unless you feel you can get another one easily. Just try to view it as any other dress code rule and work on getting a new job. Also document people harassing you in case you make a claim against your employer. </p>
<p>I am forced to be remote so I don‚Äôt have to deal with this specific issue but I do have to listen to my doomer co-workers fear monger in meetings. I definitely won‚Äôt get another job right now if I have to quit or get fired, so I‚Äôve just ignored it for now. It sucks but unless you feel well off enough sometimes you just have to listen to your boss rant until you can own your own business.</p>

        <p>Okay. I‚Äôm going to ignore your racial / physical comments for now since you‚Äôre just venting. But do not repeat any of that to anyone else at work or you‚Äôll be the one losing your job.</p>
<p>Do you work in a company large enough to have an HR department? Report the ‚Äúbitch‚Äù comments, anything snide, and type it all up and e-mail it to yourself as a record. I know your husband was only defending you, but what exactly did he say? If it was ‚Äúhey, what did you call my wife? Leave her alone‚Äù fine, but if it was ‚ÄúShut the fuck up you Jewish pussy‚Äù... well that‚Äôs not fine.</p>
<p>Document hostile workplace, but then you can‚Äôt ‚Äúhostile‚Äù your way back. If there‚Äôs no regulations on wearing masks in the bathrooms then they shouldn‚Äôt hassle you.</p>

        <p>These people sound utterly pathetic, I wouldn't want to work with them.</p>
<p>I don't have your dilemma, as I already got laid off. Before the layoff I had been dreading the inevitable (basically what you're describing). I had no intention of complying, period. But the office does mandatory health check routine stickers everywhere masks etc. I just can't. I can't support anyone that does it and I will not comply, period.</p>
<p>The more lives they destroy with this bullshit will just add to those fighting against it with nothing better to do. The tide has turned <em>even on Twitter</em>, despite their best efforts to censor and manipulate.</p>
<p>Everyone still clinging to this is on the wrong side of history and oblivious to what's really happening. Can't look at those people the same way ever again.</p>

        <p>What are you describing is interesting and something I have witnessed in my life. I currently work with one of my oldest friends (he was in my wedding and we have known each other for well over 10 years at this point), he was never an extremely manly guy - always was more into tech, video games, and art. But still we spent the most part of our mid-to-late 20s binge drinking and chasing women (before we were married). He went from someone who would have unprotected sex with women he just met to fast forward a decade, marriage, and a child later to someone who is terrified of this virus and is willing to accept almost any restrictions imposed in the name of safety. </p>
<p>I literally do not even recognize him these days. </p>
<p>What's interesting to me is he went from someone who was apolitical to having TDS in the time-frame from 2016 to present. He also leaned heavily into the bugman lifestyle, went from being interested in to obsessed with tech. He stopped exercising and really kind of has become round and more effeminate. </p>
<p>I really do think it is social engineering from media/social media that has changed him.</p>
