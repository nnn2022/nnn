    <strong>Guy’s please give me hope, feeling very suicidal lately</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a 24 year old female living in Estonia and things have gotten very bad here recently. The government changes restrictions every week and also threatens us that even more stricter restrictions will come if people do not obey and stay home. The media scares people every day and makes fun of those who don’t want to wear masks or take the vaccine. People get harassed and kicked out of a grocery store because they don’t want to/can’t wear a mask. I just can’t believe it that normal good people are treated like criminals and they are attacked with pepper spray because they don’t cover their noses and mouth! This is absolutely sick!</p>
<p>And the sad part is, most of our society accepts that and a lot of people DEMAND complete lockdown and fines for those who don’t obey. Even my own family thinks that this is all normal and people need to do as the government tells them. People are so willingly giving their freedoms away. </p>
<p>I honestly don’t know what to do. It all feels like some sort of a sick nightmare that will never end. I’m only 24 years old and I’m scared to death thinking about this is it and the normal life will never return. I don’t want to live in this sick society where everything normal is considered unsafe and prohibited. </p>
<p>Plus the poverty is rising because the government is shutting everything down and they wont support the people who have lost their jobs. I work in the restaurant industry and my hours have been cut so much that I don’t even know if I can pay for the rent and electricity next month.</p>
<p>Please tell me how to survive this nightmare and how to find hope in this dystopian world? :(</p></p>

        <p>Listen, don't even <em>think</em> about killing yourself.  If you do that, they win.  Consider the following...</p>
<p>Someday, somewhere, someone's going to let it publicly slip that this was all just a bunch of bullshit engineered to see how much nonsense people will put up with.  When that happens, all of us are going to be able to yell, "HAH!!! I TOLD YOU SO!!!"</p>

        <p>My wife shared something positive with me today. Yesterday when she was picking up the kids from school, one of the other moms asked her if our one younger daughter could play with hers after school some day...then she asked if we had "MSN messenger for kids" (or something). My wife tells me she laughed and said she had never heard of it, but the girls could play at the park or our house some time.</p>
<p>My wife thought that this other woman was offended, but today she left a note with our daughter saying that a "real playdate" would be nice. Either she came to her senses, or she had just been too scared to admit to someone else that she was okay with kids socializing from anywhere but behind a screen. Either way, small hope.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. You're brave and strong to go out on a limb and share. There are hundreds of thousands like you! We will get through this. It's hard to live in this dystopian nightmare. Know that you can do hard things. On the other side of this is a contingency of society who will know fact from fiction. It's a huge burden to understand however it's liberating at the same time. We are here for you.  There will be a greater appreciation for normal and you will experience it with people who also see truth.  Let's find you a telegram group of like minded people near you!</p>

<p>Talk to people when you can. Try to engage them in meaningful conversation. Most people, when pushed, are unsure about all this to say the least. Only truly cruel people (and I don't think there are many of those) would not sympathize with you not being allowed to work enough.</p>

        <p>It can’t go on much longer. After this is over things will return back to normal for at least over 1 decade. I don’t know when the next large scale plan will start but there’s usually a long peace period in between (sometimes lasting decades). 
This can’t last, it must come to an end. Each country’s government is amounting pressure to end their lockdowns by a growing number of people. The U.S. is opening 1 state at a time, the rest of the world will be forced to follow or fall behind. 
The world wide lockdown has passed the halfway point. We’re getting close to the end.</p>

        <p>&rt;The media scares people every day and makes fun of those who don’t want to wear masks or take the vaccine.</p>
<p>This is a tactic to get you to comply, and if you believe that your gut instincts is telling you something is wrong, than go with your gut instincts! We, in this sub-reddit, were you are at, we doubted what was going on, we went with our gut instincts, and it turns out we have been right. </p>
<p>It is natural to feel the world around you is going crazy, that is how we feel, so you are not alone. I would suggest to fine people who think similar to you, and talk to them. Please do not hold what you are feeling inside too long because it will begin to eat you from the inside out, and make you a miserable person. You don not want that, you have people here, and I know that you are not the only one in Estonia that feels like this.</p>
<p>Now, okay, how to survive the nightmare? It is going to be tough, and hard, but it is doable! You are here, that is the first step! You must find your niche, for me? It is speaking out on the web, and making YouTube videos, and blog posts! Once you begin, people will call you crazy, delusional and paranoid, consider that a compliment; I mean it! It means you are questioning what is happening, and it also means you think for yourself: CONTINUE TO DO SO!</p>
<p>Lastly, exercise, turn off the television, and take time to decompress your mental state. Me? I like to take hikes, walks, do martial arts, and game. It helps keep you grounded, and for G-d's sake, STOP WATCHING THE NEWS? Did I mention to stop watching the news? Here in America, the news, the media and their collaborators just report Corona Virus this, Corona Virus that, etc. It is just all bad news 24 hours day, 7 days a week. I noticed this back in February 2020, and in March 2020 I stopped watching the news because it became obvious the media was more trying to scare you then report  the news. So number one, turn off the news/television! </p>
<p>Number two, take time for yourself! Exercise, hike or hobbies are a great stress reducer, and many studies have shown it helps keep you mentally stable, in addition the physical benefits. </p>
<p>Number three, find people who think like you! Create a blog, make YouTube videos, make sub-reddit posts! Find areas where you can speak out, and people to speak to. This is sub-reddit is a perfect place to start. Continue to ask questions, and when you're done asking those questions, ask other questions until you're blue in the face or until you fingers can't type any more.</p>
<p>Lastly, YOU ARE NOT ALONE! You have people here on this sub-reddit who will listen, so do not believe in the nonsense that you are a "conspiracy theorists" or some denier of sorts because you disagree with what is happening in your country. You have EVERY RIGHT to be concerned what is happening in your country because what happens today will affect potentially your children, your children's children! </p>
<p>We are here for one another, and that means you, too!</p>

        <p>What the government is doing is unforgiveable. They are not only telling people to forget about everything fun. They are telling people they should stay home, work from home if they can and if they can't, well stay home and die of starvation cause they won't be giving everyone the money to survive.</p>
<p>And the worst thing is that most people won't understand the magnitude of this until they have nothing to eat or no money. Then they will see how COVID does not come before money to survive. No disease does.</p>
