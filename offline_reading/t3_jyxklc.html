        <p>It’s a known fact that being obese makes people more susceptible to the virus because of their poor immune system response (cytokine storms). Basically obese people are gigantic (in many ways) viral replication machines contributing to viral load in the population. They also contribute negatively to statistics that are prolonging this pandemic due to their poor covid19 outcomes.</p>
<p>I think it’s high time we call on obese people to stop being selfish granny killers and start losing some weight for the greater good. </p>
<p>I’m only marginally not serious.</p>

<p>Johns Hopkins Hospital did a study on this exact subject in 2001 and the results were surprising even to them. They found out that 'obese' people used in their lifetimes 50K less health care than right weight and underweight people <strong>AND</strong> that the health care they did use?</p>
<p>Comparable to that of the right weight and underweight people.</p>
<p>Truth of the real world is that most health care in this country is for conditions that are not obesity related. I.E. I have had HBP since I was in high school and it has NOT gotten better nor worse since I became obese at about 26 years of age.</p>
<p>I just finally bowed to my doctor 2 years ago and allowed him to treat me for the HBP I've had for 24 years.</p>

        <p>That sounds to me more like a problem with their working definition of "obese," because otherwise it completely flies in the face of sense.</p>
<p>Anyone with a lick of reason knows that BMI and "obese" are terrible indicators of health. They fail to account for overall fitness, and many particulars of individual body shape and type.</p>
<p>But if you're trying to make the case that being fat as shit isn't a health problem that comes out in the resources eventually necessary to maintain life for such a person, or, as you appear to be, actually want people to accept that it's somehow <em>better</em> to be blobby, you're going to have to pull the other one. G'head, love, it's got bells on.</p>

        <p>I think you should be serious as shit about it. I have no patience whatsoever for doomers who bloviate on facebook about how lazy they are during the pandemic, and how they've gained a bunch of covid weight. As if becoming a sedentary, alcoholic shut-in was some kind of morally superior lifestyle.</p>
<p>Personally, I got really sick in February, covid or not. 100+ fever for a week solid, and no appetite, sweating constantly. When I ran the course, it was a health wake-up call, so I went ahead and lost 50 more pounds on top of the 10 that went during the sickness. </p>
<p>It's not just about weight issues--it further demonstrates how bullshit all of this is. People who at least appear to fully buy into all this crap <em>proudly declare</em> an even greater commitment to refusing to take care of themselves. They gain weight, they've upped their drug and alcohol consumption, they eat take-out far too many times per week, they don't do anything for their lack of sunshine and fresh air.</p>
<p><em>That's</em> what <em>I</em> have to subsidize? My children can't go to school anymore and I'm supposed to strap a kleenex to my nose to buy apples and bananas for my family, to protect the health of <em>these people?</em></p>
<p>It's an affront.</p>

        <p>I made this argument not too long back that there are 480k people that die from smoking (don't forget about secondhand smoke) a year in the US. This isn't about health to be honest, they don't give a fuck about what kind of fast foods people consume or the soda they drink, if it was about health they would let people know how they can exercise, eat right, take vitamin C, Vitamin D, get sunlight to boost their immune system</p>

        <p>I remember about 30 years ago when my juvenile diabetic mom had an infected sore on her foot that had gone to the bone, and she didn't feel it because of neuropathy. She almost lost that foot.</p>
<p>Soooo...I decided that, for her own good, i was going to collect all of her pretty but not-doctor-approved heels and get rid of them. While she was in the hospital, I threw them out.</p>
<p>At the time, I truly, deeply believed that it was ok to do this--because it was for her health and safety...</p>
<p>It was not ok to do that.</p>

        <p>The big pharma's and the entire medical system love fat people.  All their health problems give them an endless supply of ever-growing revenue.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's not the fat person's problem that they are fat, (sometimes it is pure genetics) but we have conditioned them to believe fat is ok and have taken away all the healthy lifestyles and activities in schools and communities that curbed this and replaced it with video games, social media and  Big Mac's! with doorstep delivery.</p>
<p>They need us to have compromised immune systems so they can make money on treating the side effects, and well to experiment on us as well but that's another story.</p>
