    <strong>Why are people acting like covid is the first virus to ever go around??</strong>
    <p><p>I'd like to ask these mask cultists what they do every flu season when the flu is spreading like wildfire. Their logic with the covid masks is, "Oh, you could have the virus even if you aren't showing symptoms, and pass it on to some unsuspecting person!" Um, fair enough, but you do realize that's the case with...every virus, right? And you do realize that the flu is potentially dangerous as well, in addition to a host of other common viruses that have been going around forever which people don't even bat an eye at. How come masks have never been mandated during flu season? After all, there's always the chance that someone could be an asymptomatic carrier, who <em>might</em> happen to pass the virus on to somebody who <em>might</em> just end up dead or hospitalized from it. </p>
<p>Don't be fucking hypocrites. If you think we should be wearing masks for covid, then we might as well be wearing them during flu season too, and hell, while we're at it, why not every other time of the year as well, since viruses are still spreading then too? I mean, we can't <em>possibly</em> take the chance of breathing openly and killing someone, right?</p></p>

        <p>I've also noticed that people seem to blame individuals rather than the virus itself. </p>
<p>Cases rising? 'oh its those selfish people having a BBQ' (meanwhile thousands attend protests)</p>
<p>Someone you know died? ' oh the selfish children must have brought it home'</p>
<p>Another question i have is that if masks are so effective why cant we reopen, if protests are fine why cant i work or go to college?</p>

        <p>ItS NeW! We know nothing about it except that it's a weak ass cold that the majority of people already contracted or had some immunity to. But tell that to someone with a cundishun who expects the entire human population to stay indoors or wrap rags around their faces because a 104 year old might choose to walk past you and then have a miniscule chance of dying a horrible death worse than any other. I read that one person is crippled for life because of it. No thank you. I'll collect unemployment until some company that's responsible for hundreds of mesothelioma deaths charges me for a brand new chemical cocktail. And I haven't thought anything through after that point. Surely I will be able to safely go see my favorite country music artist in a crowded Las Vegas venue after 100% of people have gotten a 50% effective vaccine, right?</p>

<p>Shh.  Don't give them any ideas.  Let them believe that COVID is the only virus that spreads asymptomatically, that way they'll quit bitching once it dies out.  If they find out that cold and flu do as well, they'll be forcing us all to strap dirty rags on our faces every winter.</p>

        <p>Because its the 1st one theyve noticed due to their own stupidity.  They didnt know flu was that bad, they thought/think it was just like a cold and no one dies from it. They also didnt/dont know flu is a virus. They also have no clue how many people actually just die. They try to cover for their broad, persistant, willful stupidity and laziness with easy rEaSoNs and sCiEnCe</p>
