    <strong>The biggest hypocrisy with the pro-coronaists</strong>
    <p><p>And yes. That is my new nickname for these corona pro doomers. Pro coronaist. The corona communists who want the new normal to extend until the end of time.</p>
<p>One of the biggest hypocrisy’s with these people is that if you mention any point of being reluctant/hesitant with regards to the experimental vaccine, you immediately get shut down by spreading “misinformation”, even if it’s a question. This is because there is supposedly no allowance for the hypothetical that these vaccines could actually negatively impact people</p>
<p>BUT.... we have to live forever with the hypothetical that we could pass on the virus... with or without a vaccine. Positive or negative corona test, and with a lack of conclusive evidence for mask wearing... There’s no way of knowing if you’ve actually given it to someone else.</p>
<p>Rules for thee but not for me they say.</p>
