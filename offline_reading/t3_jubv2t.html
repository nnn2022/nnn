    <strong>It's over.</strong>
    <p><p>Honestly. All because the average person is an absolute moron. No matter what factual statistics I show them about the virus, there's nothing I can do to convince them, and they think I'm a paranoid crazy conspiracy theorist, when the World Economic Forum has their agenda all written out and world leaders around the world are spouting their quotes verbatim. I 100% believe this is an intentional planned demolition of Western economies as per The Great Reset for a virus with a 99.98% survival rate. If you have eyes and a working brain it's staring you right in the face. </p>
<p>I'm from the UK and we've been living under tyranny now for nearly the full year. Boris said in the beginning that it would "take 3 weeks to flatten the curve" and we're still here. Even before this new "hard" lockdown starting early November we weren't really free, we were still under relentless restrictions, and it really doesn't look like this is ever going away. Even with this so-called "vaccine" announced Boris is downplaying it and insisting that things won't go back to normal even with it. We are honestly fucked and we're going to be enslaved for the rest of our fucking lives. Europe has no way to resist this tyranny like US citizens can either.</p></p>

        <p>Don't worry, the US will be joining you on the tyranny train shortly.</p>
<p>They just elected a drooling, corrupt dotard who wants a national mask mandate. And when he kicks the bucket in the next year or so, there is a full-on Marxist race-baiter with a God complex waiting in the wings to take his place.</p>
<p>Nothing short of a full-on revolution in the streets, or the refusal of the police and military to enforce the Globalist's tyrannical edicts, will stop it now.</p>

        <p>Well at least you have the means of resisting. In Europe we have no means of it as we're unarmed. If I were in the US I would resist. I also believe Americans WILL resist. You have that in your nature. I don't see Biden being able to force lockdown in conservative states successfully (which is a really good thing). UK peasants however have been ruled by kings for hundreds of years sadly.</p>
<p>Btw Biden hasn't actually been elected yet, only the media claims he has. Trump is the only politician with clout in the entire world talking about opening up. I really hope he wins mainly for this reason. The fraud committed by the dems is also beyond obvious but I'm so blackpilled that I don't see Trump's election happening. He's got the entire establishment going against him. We'll see though. If he wins it will be a real miracle and a huge boost to my morale but my god the press will no doubt cause chaos if it's the case.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that I'm so blackpilled... it doesn't help anything really. I'm just extremely depressed these days and I've never felt so low in my life.</p>

        <p>I hope you're right About us Americans but while we've been raised since the Declaration of Independence (and even before that !) to stay armed and ready to fight our own government they've spent the last several decades trying to teach otherwise, erase history, and make us compliant.
I've been sorely disappointed in the US citizens willingness to lie down and take it.</p>

        <p>Nope. My wife is very pro-lockdown and mask, and she considers our rights to be privileges that the government can take away for our safety. Sadly she's not alone in her thinking, that's basically the consensus right now.</p>

        <p>Trump today admitted Biden won but refuses to concede. He wants to make as big of a fuss as possible because the only thing protecting him from going to jail on charges of tax fraud is presidential immunity. He also has over 1 billion in debt. That’s why he’s trying to secure another term, (although at least of right now he losing 290/232 electoral votes). May be a bit of topic but there’s the answer for who’s been elected.</p>

<p>Incidentally I posted him being interviewed about lockdowns by Sky News on r/LS but no one could be bothered to listen for ten minutes. A mod later asked me to provide a summary, but why would I invest more time in a post that didn't catch on.</p>

        <p>I have nothing to say. Even as Singapore is by definition a state that was always on the fringe of becoming a nanny state. But now, it is a nanny state. They just mandated a physical tagging or an app on their citizen's phones. And no one cares or even blinks an eye. It is as incredible as it sounds. </p>
<p>They said that it was for the sake of the public safety, that it is an easier system than the QRcode but I know that it isn't. To get just that little extra, it isn't. </p>
<p>This is just making just adjust to a new normal, one that would never end. I want to fight but I simply don't know how, and no one seems to care and think that Covid is the boogeymen that they need to destroy. Regardless of what it does to your social life, your mental health, or even just life in general. Regardless of what it costs them in their freedoms and right to choose.</p>

        <p>The fact that the world never repudiated China in the last 40 years seems to suggest that we're all going to end up in a surveillance state and non-democracy. </p>
<p>I have no faith in any institution to do the right thing for traditional democratic norms and the betterment of the people in it. Not certain people, not public unions, not corporations, ALL PEOPLE. </p>
<p>I'm glad to be middle aged, I couldn't deal with this as a 20yo looking at a wasteland in front of me. This is the first time in any society historically that the older people are arguably glad they're old and not young. Baby boomers with all the money and power, Gen X at least got a fucking childhood and not too indoctrinated education, etc.</p>

        <p>I’m not entirely convinced that this is the work of the World economic forum, but everything that’s happening definitely has political reasons. Read this theory in a brilliant article in Swedish ("Den politiska pandemin") that I’ll try to paraphrase here. The government of any country has very little to lose by imposing a lockdown and other measures to take away our freedom. </p>
<p>Imagine being the leader in a country struck by fear, what’s your course of action? If you impose a lockdown people might get upset with you for ruining their business, but at least you’re doing something, and scared people want quick solutions. If the death rate increases, no one can say you didn’t do anything to save lives. If the death rate decreases you can say it’s thanks to you. You win no matter what. </p>
<p>If you don’t lock down many people will be happy to have their freedoms, but it won’t be thanks to you, cause you’re just maintaining the normal state of things. Same goes in case of a decreased or normal death rate. If the death rate increases however people will blame you for it. It would probably cost you your political career. </p>
<p>Politically speaking it’s a no-brainer, of course you become a police state. People will comply willingly and they’ll even hail you for taking action. Let’s remember that the main goal of politics is to increase your power. I’m sure opinions will change once the media shifts its war narrative, but it’ll take a while. Once the pandemic is over the media will start looking at the socioeconomic consequences of shutting down the world, and once they do, the narrative is gonna change. But I’m afraid it could be years away.</p>
