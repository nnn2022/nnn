        <p>Did they really use the Black Plague as an example? Where healthy people were locked in with their sick family members and left to die? Also, not sure of the stats but I’m pretty sure the mortality rate was way higher. People then didn’t need to be brainwashed into being afraid of getting it.</p>

        <p>I did a little research to see how deadly the Black Plague is compared to COVID, and from what I saw, even with treatment, the Plague has a 10% to kill you.  Without treatment, this chance goes up to 70-90%.  COVID is by far way less dangerous.</p>

        <p>How in the fuck can someone in their right mind use the Black Plague as a comparative example.... the black plague if I remember correctly without looking it up had a 70-80% chance of killing someone without any treatment and if I remember correctly treatment for it came way later on which is why so many folks had died from it.... hell if corona was a scenario similar to that, I would lock myself in my own home and wear 5 masks if it meant survival, I'm sure as hell not doing that for something with a 99.7% recovery rate!</p>

        <p>And there's absolutely no way of even the remotest possibility that this virus could have even been a new Black Death because 1. Bubonic plague was caused by bacteria...not a virus. 2. A huge portion of the population died only because of the times it occurred in...a time without antibiotics, any modern amenities, or even basic sanitation. People literally disposed of their feces in the streets back then, and hygiene was horrific. 3. Viruses have a certain nature where the more easily communicable and contagious they are, the less dangerous and deadly they are. Covid is just like all the other flu and common cold type viruses in that it is extremely contagious, but has an extremely low IFR, with the vast majority of people who contract it having mild or no symptoms. Such viruses only "kill" 100,000 people because they have infected tens of millions and are too easily transmitted to be slowed, contained. Hence when you hear of 500 cases in a city of two million it is laughable and absurd. It's like saying there are 500 flu cases...a there are orders of magnitude more than that, and b. Simple math and proportions. Something like ebola, on the other hand, is extremely dangerous and deadly and has and literally kills half the people who contract it, regardless of their age or health status. The trade-off is that it is way more difficult to transmit, as it is not a respiratory virus And 4...last but not least, there was already plenty of solid data back in January, that clearly showed that covid is a. Along the lines of the common flu in its mortality rate and b. Was only deadly to those who are already very old and frail (the exact same people who would die of the flu or pneumonia in any given year). So essentialy, this was nothing to worry about and didn't warrant anything more than H1N1 did in 2009. Even High Priest Fauci was saying this back in February. But for some bizarre reason, they flipped the switch in March, and went into what can only be described as a complete psychotic break. I still wake up every day and wonder why and how they did that. It's truly surreal.</p>

        <p>Don't they realize that they are victim blaming? A person has to be infected first to spread the disease. They have this idea in their head that there are millions of typhoid Marys running around infecting people but are spared all symptoms. Studies have already proved asymptomatic transmission doesn't exist. They may as well go to the hospital and start yelling at all the covid patients about how selfish they are for getting sick</p>
