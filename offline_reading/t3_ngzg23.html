    <strong>The mentally weak love being ruled.</strong>
    <p><p>It is obvious throughout the plethora of government mandates that two different type of people exist. </p>
<p>One group questions “what evidence do you have to prove the need to restrict freedoms”, and the other says “the government has our collective best interests at heart- even if I have to give up x, y, or z”. </p>
<p>You could define them as right or left on the political spectrum- or independent or dependent on the system. </p>
<p>It is no secret that mental health issues are rampant these days. Or that there is a system that encourages obedience and rewards the population’s acquiescence. </p>
<p>What is the root characteristic that causes this? I believe it is a hijacked mechanism conditioned within the mentally weak (not saying they’re  inferior in any way) which makes them feel like they need to fight for something in their life bigger than themselves continually pressed on them (ie migrants, women’s rights, institutional racism, etc). And when the “government” who has the “power to fix all of this” says do this or that, (wear your mask, call out anti vaxxers, religious people are radicals cause atheism is real) they will fall completely in line. </p>
<p>Btw the fact that most leftists are atheists is another topic but basically if you believe there is nothing after this life, you’re on a one-way one time death mission to “fix as much as possible quickly and damn the consequences”.</p></p>

        <p>They don't realize it, but atheists are the biggest believers on earth. They can be fooled to believe in literally anything, and they are.</p>

        <p>I’m an atheist and I use the knowledge of my impermanence to fuel my hopes and dreams, not trying to fix as much as possible. I get the sentiment though. It’s weird because I always thought people who believed in an afterlife had the mentality of “eh, fuck this place. I’m just passing through”. Obviously both sides are way more nuanced than that. </p>
<p>You’re dead on about the two types of people. I’ve been disappointed to discover which of the people in my life fall into the “government has our best interest at heart” crowd, even when faced with mountains of evidence to the contrary.</p>

        <p>You have some interesting points. I am definitely not affiliated with a religion. I believe...I hope there is some metaphysical world beyond this. Something indescribable. I have no idea, but I have some faith. I could fall in that same category, but for the other side...your side.  I want to do as much good for this world as I can while I'm here</p>

<p>Yes, you pretty much are.  Or is there some context in which "mentally weak" implies superiority? </p>
<p>Never forget that humans are in essence pack animals.  We evolved for hundreds of thousands of years in groups which establish dominance and hierarchy.  Expecting each human to take personal responsibility and be an individual is a concept only a few hundred years old.  </p>
<p>People who think that the next level of human society is total cooperation and communal goals have it backwards.  That's where we are coming from.</p>
