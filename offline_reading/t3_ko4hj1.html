        <p>She is probably full of shit. I do Spark delivery. We have to take a picture of the groceries after we deliver them. That is prob why she has to pay for them again. Walmart has proof (the picture) that she received them. Also, when you have the app open, it has access to your location. So it would know the driver was in the area.</p>

        <p>I know mistakes happen with delivery, like amazon took a picture of my package delivered on my neighbors porch. Not saying this happened with the nurse but itâ€™s not unheard of.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I personally order from Walmart in Aberdeen, Maryland and the one type of GPS that some of their employees use send them all the way over on the other side of Aberdeen from where my house is on a regular basis.</p>
<p>It has gotten to the point where I asked the person who was bringing the groceries to my home and couldn't find it what brand of GPS they used and I contact Walmart and told them "Don't use these... they do not send people to my address which has been extant for 100 years now correctly!"</p>
