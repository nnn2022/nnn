    <strong>Next they’re gonna shut down beaches in the summer because there’s more drowning than in the winter</strong>
    <p><p>I am so sick of all of this. I have a very strong background in statistics and I know very well how numbers can lie, be misinterpreted, and be used to manipulate opinion. I see this all of the time and it drives me crazy!</p>
<p>I see things like “your chances of getting the virus are 5x higher now,” or “you have an x% of getting the virus.” The way they calculate this is such bullshit, it doesn’t even approximate reality. I’ve wanted to use their methods to calculate various things: car accident, airplane, slipping and falling, random shooting, terrorist attack, choking on food, etc, and add all of these up, and “prove” mathematically that your chances of dying from one of these things is over 100% every single day, to show how absurd all of this is.</p>
<p>Here’s another slightly more technical example. Back in the beginning of the pandemic, when they were talking about flattening the curve, there were some real world examples of different curves being flattened in the past. For example, there was one that compared two cities in the United States during an outbreak where one city held a parade, and the other canceled their events early. The results were clear, there was a higher peak in the city that held the parade, and the other city seemingly “flattened the curve.” However, the case number was the same between both, and nobody talked about that. </p>
<p>When you flatten any curve as they show, the sides get wider, therefore the area underneath that curve stays the same (equal number of cases). This isn’t just a mathematical proof, there are real examples of this, where the case number doesn’t change regardless of the actions taken. A huge spike is followed by a sharp drop off. It’s almost as if some people are bound to get the virus and others aren’t. It’s almost as if our efforts are futile. It’s almost as if we still don’t understand the vast complexity of how viruses and diseases spread. It’s almost as if there’s an agenda behind all of this.</p>
<p>Okay, rant over. Thanks to anyone who reads/engages in this</p></p>

        <p>Titles matter. Repost this exact thread with "Statistician here. Their numbers are lies, here's why."</p>
<p>You'll get a lot more interaction.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert in statistics but I did take an experimental psychology course. We were assigned a project where the outcome needed to be statistically significant. </p>
<p>The teacher provided ways I could manipulate my experiment to make the numbers work, so i agree with the topic but it was never something I was very good at. </p>
<p>This topic is a goldmine and you should repost it. Maybe not tonight but in a few days with the alternate title.</p>

        <p>Yeah you’re right. I wasn’t necessarily going for a big response to this, I just wanted to rant, but perhaps I’ll repost/revise this later with a proper title. Thanks!</p>

        <p>I appreciate your post. Most people don't know anything about statistics, myself included, let alone how they can be manipulated to prove a desired objective. At this point it seems like unbiased sources don't exist. It's as futile to argue with someone over jabs and lockdowns as it is to try to convince a Christian to become an atheist.</p>
