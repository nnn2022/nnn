    <strong>Looking for assistance gathering statistics</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all! Throwaway account here, to keep as unbiased as possible. I'm fed up with how actual information and statistics are incredibly hard, if not downright impossible, to find, and that the media seems to be obscuring the facts as much as physically possible.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Want to collect as much nonpartisan statistical data into one source, as unbiased as possible, as well as compare the major dangers that they're putting on Covid to other diseases we're used to, such as influenza, common cold, tuberculosis and others.</strong> </p>
<p>Anyone with verified trusted sources that can't be denounced as left-wing lunacy by the right, or right-wing drivel by the left, is welcomed with open arms. I just want to be able to point at something that has no slant to the best of my ability, and get people's legitimate opinions on what the data is saying. </p>
<p>Bonus points on any information on PCR test reliability, false positive and negative rate, as well as antibody test information and potential inflated numbers in New York because of overly aggressive ventilator use. I'm trying to get information on everything and anything and would love any help you can give.</p>
<p>This is what made me decide I needed to do something -</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm</a> </p>
<p>Scroll down to table three. CDC says outright that only 6% of people died of Covid alone. 2.6 was the average number of comorbidies. And when you look at their numbers, they're not even trying to hide that fact that literally everyone is a covid death. 63,246 people died from 'all other conditions and causes' - some casual perusal of the ICD-10 codes listed death by scalding, death by congenital condition, and bulimia... not exactly something that covid could cause, and yet they got put with the covid people with all the rest. The CDC has all of this information and yet makes no effort to split the numbers from died of covid vs. died WITH covid. The fact that no one is mentioning the false positive/negative rate is making me very concerned as well. They also freely list the fact that they're using probable or presumed covid diagnoses, and those aren't separated from the lab-confirmed tests either, at least as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Continuing with the insanity, "Intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events" is listed. Nearly 4000 people, CLEARLY did not keel over from the beer bug, and yet still a covid death! I'm not in the medical field, but I don't understand how this kind of statistical practice is acceptable. Any help or suggestions you guys can give would be greatly, greatly appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>So Hold2LLC on twitter produces incredible statistics as does TheEthicalSkeptic (honestly he’s a statistician for disasters and his stuff is extremely technical and occasionally hard to stand but it’s just hard numbers and stats. ElGatoMalo on Twitter is more of a commentator but also posts a fair amount of stats.</p>

        <p>I've seen Ethical Skeptic, and as you say, his statistics are a little much for me :') I've tried to follow along but it's a bit above my ken unfortunately. I'll look into Hold2LLC  and ElGatoMalo right now, thanks a million!</p>

        <p>I'm not a doctor, but I'm not sure what else scalding would mean. I just put in random ICD-10 codes from their 'all other causes' category. Tragic for sure, but I don't see how the virus could have caused that! And yet it's being counted with all the rest.</p>
