        <p>I remember back in early April people were saying they were going to use Covid to push for mail in voting in November. I thought there was no way they could scare people seven months from then. I also remember very early people talking about how the ventilators are doing more harm than good and this was at the peak of ventilator mania.</p>

        <p>Not sure how mail in voting breaks PA constitution. Article 7 says as long as it is secret and a ballot, it’s constitutional in PA. Perhaps you don’t agree with the method, but your opinion doesn’t count in law.</p>

        <p>Actually the arguments for it breaking the constitution of PA is because it actually does place voting restrictions in it's constitution. So in order to put mail in voting legally it would need to be an amendment to their constitution which initially it was but in order for the amendment to be added it would have to be voted on by the people of PA in the election they wanted the mail in voting for. So they just wrote a law that violates their own voting restrictions in their state constitution. The other problem is that the courts haven't actually dismissed any case on the actual merits but by procedural grounds not allowing the arguments to be proven or disproven.</p>

<p>That is what the PA constitution says. Article 7 subsection 4. Nothing about changing the constitution or amendments. I actually live in PA and I know how my government works.</p>

        <p>I did. It says the legislature shall provide the methods of absentee voting by way of general law. The general laws in the state of Pennsylvania give large leeway to the secretary of the commonwealth in making decisions around elections and election procedures. Yes, there is other language about what counts, one of which is observance of a holiday.</p>
<p>Much like the covid rules in PA allow for medical exceptions without documenting proof of medical condition, the rules around holidays don’t let the gov confirm there is a religion or holiday actually happening. Freedom you see.</p>

        <p>That's part of why it needs to be decided in court if mail in ballots violate the constitutional requirements since this law was put into effect before covid and when it was originally challenged it was dismissed for lack of damages since it had not been used in an election yet.  There's enough leeway that both perspectives have points so the court needs to do their job and say which interpretation is the one that will be used moving forward. </p>
<p>Though many judges seem to be too scared of the potential consequences of either decision in these polarized times so they side with the ones that won under the current results.</p>

        <p>Except it has already gone to the state Supreme Court, which ruled mail in ballots were legal, and that they could be accepted if postmarked by Election Day and received by the counties by the Friday after Election Day. The US Supreme Court declined to hear the case because it is a state matter, not a federal matter. The case was heard and decided BEFORE the election. </p>

        <p>The most compelling argument surrounding voter fraud was the one about how you'd be the one to stand up to Hitler if you had the chance. Plenty of people are convinced Trump is Orange Hitler and have been conditioned for four years to believe he's an evil puppet of Russia who is solely responsible for your grandmother's death. People are dumb enough to believe that a new nazi regime would allow all mass media to stand opposed to the evil dictator and that every individual would be the hero who stood up to the nazis. These are delusional claims and there are enough useful idiots working at counting centers to go along with it.</p>

        <p>"I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I have a PhD in computer science my partner has a PhD in Chemistry, based on research in the area of Biological Synthesis of Pharmaceutically Active Molecules All of those considering taking, or being bribed into taking this vaccine, with the promise of freedoms restored that you already had and have conceded...
1) You do realise this is not a normal vaccine, yes? 2) You recognise that this permanently and irreversibly changes your DNA? 3) You fully understand that this has never been done before in the history of mankind and there is not a single person on this planet who truly knows what the outcome is? 4) You are totally aware, that if anything does go wrong, you have no come back and cannot be treated?
Just checking you know what I know, Also if you still think Covid is real and very dangerous then ask yourself these questions;
Why are GP's not isolating? dying? Why are frontline staff not isolating? dying? Why are police officers not isolating? dying? Why are soldiers not isolating? dying? Why are bus drivers not isolating? dying? Why are most hospitals empty? Why are testing centres empty? Why is it that 96% of people testing positive are mask wearers?
Why is it bacterial pneumonia is on the rise because of mask wearing? Yet it's kept hush hush. Why is it that large conglomerates can stay open whilst small businesses of the same industry are bullied into shutting? Why is it that the BBC was funded by Bill Gates to peddle pro Covid propaganda? Why is it that the biggest censorship campaign is now in force? Why is it that if you even question the narrative you believe the earth is flat and that lizard people exist? Why is it that the 'Great Reset' is being openly advertised yet people still deny it?
Why is it that in Wuhan people were dropping dead in the streets yet it's happening nowhere else? Why is it that the mainstream media are using crisis actors and dummies to peddle fear? Why is it that our police force has undergone a huge militarisation? Why has police brutality skyrocketed? Why are the fact-check websites funded by the same elites that are funding the media for pro covid propaganda? Why is Google blacklisting well documented science that disproves all this pro covid science? Why is Google blacklisting anything that questions the narrative?
If this virus was so deadly then why; Would you need a test to tell you that you've got it? Why are graveyards and crematoriums not overflowing? Why are hospitals not overwhelmed to the point of everything else is fully cancelled? Why are people not dropping dead like in Wuhan? Why do you need an app to tell you to isolate? Why has China gone back to 'normal' without a vaccine? Why has Covid-19 never been isolated?
"Hell on earth is looking in the mirror and wondering what could of been"
The next stage of the Covid1984 Operation is to "deploy" the vaccine amongst the public. The "authorities" know that a lot of people who accept the lockdown measures and who accept wearing masks to "protect the common good" are unhappy about having rushed vaccine injected into them.
So to deter them the media is now in over drive to portray those with reservations as "dangerous anti-vaxxers". Despite the fact that a lot of people with reservations are not anti vax, not anti science, not anti medicine or pharmacetical drugs. They're just anti not having a choice about whether to have this vaccine or not.
By labelling all Covid Vacine hesitant or refusers as crazed anti science conpiracy theorists it creates an US vs Them dialectic that will then be used to create a conflict where those who say no to the vaccine will be blamed by those content to roll up their sleeves and have it for preventing the country from moving out of rolling lockdowns and "back to normal".
Articles like this are programming the minds of people in society to "choose a side" which can then be pitted against each other and via the divide and rule technique ultimately control us all. How about we respect one another's right to choose what we do with our own bodies and decide for ourselves whether we have the vaccine or not rather than force one another's choice on the other instead? They are called "our own bodies" for a reason.... we own our own bodies. Our bodies are our property and as such no one else has the right to tell us what we should put in or on our bodies. Those claiming that right are saying in not so many words that they own us and have the right to control us against our wishes as that is....slavery.
So ‘Moderna’ have come out with a better vaccine which is 95% effective ....
Remember my prediction back in April?
I said out of hundreds of companies across the world, Moderna will be the ones who bring this vaccine to market!! How do we know this? Because it’s all planned!! Moderna have NEVER brought a human vaccine to market before, they are also using RNA which has NEVER been used in vaccines before and they were bailed out of bankruptcy in 2010 by wait for it Dr Fauci and Gates!! (Year might be wrong but it’s close)
Shall I tell you why I think they’ve never brought a human vaccine to market b4. I think it’s because they never planned too, look at their name ‘MOD e RNA’ they specialise in modifying DNA by using RNA!
They have been waiting for this moment for years!!! The time has come ... no one knows what the side effects will be after a few years (I have my own idea what will happen when you mix a virus with human dna but I’ll leave it there for now)
Please just look things up for yourself, start with the history and set up of the MSM because knowing they’re lying to you is step 1.
Things are going to be hard for the ones who don’t accept this vaccine but no one should sell their soul to the devil (literally)."
Keep safe people!</p>

<p>We need to stop using the term even. CIA came up with it to be used pejoratively after JFK assassination. Better term is “people interested in finding out the truth and not accepting what they’re told blindly research and analyze information to more develop a more accurate understanding of reality”.</p>

<p>I'm not an anti-vaxx. My parents were very neglectful. I wasn't vaccinated until I was 19. This was never a problem. I went to school, traveled, etc. It never came up. I'm talking about I never had the measles vaccine. Measles is more deadly than COVID. </p>
<p>Why are they trying to force us to be vaccinated for something that I have a 99.7% chance of surviving? It makes no fucking sense.</p>

<p>Because there's something in the vaccine that's going to manipulate our bodies in a way that benefits them. It's the only thing that makes sense, really.</p>
<p>There's lot of theories about what purpose the vaccine has. Sterilization is a very popular one.</p>

        <p>Idk man. Science points to mother nature being a powerful force. Historically disease has been Her weapon against humanity. Creating more strains is a natural phenomenon. I know you could argue that this is being orchestrated by the ruling class, but whether or not you predict that we can't fight a disease without vaccines. I really hope it doesn't become a thing that you HAVE to be vaccinated to do things, but this is clearly being threatened to make sure people comply and not spread the virus, not to amass wealth for themselves or something. This virus is damaging to our economy and its unsustainable, it would be stupid in the long term for politicians to be orchestrating this out of greed.</p>

        <p>...ok so you’re kind of all over the place but if you look at a <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">graph of human population growth</a>, literally NOTHING has stopped it’s rise except for a small blip due to the bubonic plague 600 years ago, a disease that killed 30-60% of the European population. If Mother Nature is a powerful force, seems it has a hard time actually impacting our species in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>Covid is a disease that kills ~0.2%.</p>
<p>If we were talking about a killer plague like that then yes basically any and all measures would be justified. We aren’t. That means that there are other reasons for the media-driven response to this, <em>at the very least</em>. Then we get to speculate what those reasons are. </p>
<p>The rich getting richer is always an easy one because well, when <em>aren’t</em> they trying to do so? In addition to the fact that the rich HAVE in fact gotten richer - about $1 trillion richer since March.</p>
<p>Then there’s politicians. “Never let a crisis go to waste” usually referring to amassing more power.</p>
<p>Greed can drive people to do horrific things like rape and pillage and create totalitarian dictatorships. In fact our history is FULL of such examples. What makes you think they wouldn’t drive a narrative to destroy their competition while making themselves richer? For them (politicians and the rich) it’s win win - and that’s all they care about.</p>

        <p>Okay so.. disease has been a driving factor in technological advancements throughout history and has TOTALLY affected our species in a meaningful way. Dissecting cadavers, developing medicine, science, creating vaccines, systems that allow us to be sanitary... None of these would happen if disease hadn't been a threat. Sure, were apter to defend ourselves now compared to then, but microorganisms evolve in their methods similarly to the way humans do. This is what's happening with the new covid strain.</p>
<p>Secondly, as you've said, the rich will always be inclined to continue amassing wealth, and it has only continued. But keep in mind, a driving force in keeping the business elite thriving is ad targeting through social media. News outlets are designed to grab your attention, outrage you, make you share, because clicks equals profit. So wouldn't it make sense that the elite are creating interest in the CONSPIRACIES to continue amassing wealth rather than in mongering fear over the pandemic? Conspiracies attract equal if not more attention than the pandemic news. </p>
<p>In other words, the elite wanting to amass wealth is an omnipresent issue whether or not there is a pandemic, and in fact, feeding into conspiracies and hysteria only feeds into this system that keeps the ruling class in power. We should address the pandemic using SCIENCE as our guide, not these grubby politicians.</p>

        <p>Re: disease. I didn’t mean “it’s passed us by and we haven’t noticed” I meant it has no demonstrated ability to threaten our species. I don’t mean to be cold here but while individual deaths matter to individuals, they don’t matter much to a population unless they impact its survivability. If even the Black Death couldn’t do that 600 years ago, Covid is certainly not doing so now (especially due to all the things you mentioned). And that means we have space for a calm, measured response and not the insanity passing for policy these days.</p>
<p>Re: the wealthy and media. I don’t necessarily disagree, but to put it plainly: why not both? Never think they do only one thing for one reason. People like to win both coming and going.</p>

        <p>Re: 1st paragraph. I know you didn't want to come off as cold but.. do you view people like cattle? I find it's dehumanizing to turn lives into statistics. Think about the words we use in regards to animals- beef, poultry.. stuff to distance from the fact that these are lives. And look at the words you use to discuss the deaths of other people -- "species", "don't matter much to a population". The same rationalization is taking place because we've grown accustomed to luxury at the expense of other lives. It's a LUXURY to be able to live the way most of the western world does. My stance on this whole thing is that ideally, the government should be able to trust the judgement of their people to go out, soft boundaries, but not complete lockdown. Lockdown measures are just the government trying to reassert their authority over those that believe this virus is a"hoax". If people genuinely understood the impact they have over their community with their actions, we wouldn't be here. </p>

        <p>I appreciate the thoughtfulness of your reply. I have LONGED for someone to ask me what you just did, but nobody ever gets that far.</p>
<p>Oh gosh how to explain a lifetime of observation in one Reddit comment. Ok. Here's a try.</p>
<p>So the goal of any effective public policy is, or should be, the effective management of the people's wealth &amp; well being; this is where the various "isms" come from - descriptions of the overarching moral and ethical frameworks under which a nation, or city, or "a people" is operating. Our elected public servants (politicians/leaders) are in fact *stewards* of the world for the rest of us. They're not there to tell us who is right and who is wrong; only to represent us in the machinations of the state. Or put another way, to carry out the demands of the people under the dictates of the framework that society has chosen as its guide. In the west's case, that is big 'L' Liberalism (liberty, free speech etc.).</p>
<p>As with most things at that level, being dispassionate is a strength. Not forgetting that we are people, but if you're being led by passion, you're also not considering alot of points of view that probably need accounting for. And if you're being led by pure reason, you're also not considering important points of view. People are emotional beings after all and that well-being has to be looked after as well (otherwise called mental health). This is saying, that both emotion and reason must be considered in decisions where an answer isn't obvious (and by obvious I mean plain - in 1 million people, basically nobody will disagree. Many if not most activities of the state fall into that category. Maintain roads. Ensure civil protection. Etc.). Dispassion can be used for both good and evil, as with most things human, as can passion. And that means that neither one is a good leader: a consciously-chosen balance between them must be struck.</p>
<p>Where this really matters is where reasonable people do disagree. And it is incredibly important that people are allowed to disagree and do so in meaningful ways, and be heard. Being heard does not equate to being pandered to or agreed with. If people feel heard, they are 1000x more likely to follow you even if they disagree. I have observed this time and time again in my life. This is sometimes called loyalty.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of Amazon, but when I worked there some years ago Amazon had (and as far as I know, still has) a value called "Disagree and Commit." There's actually a formal process by which this occurs. Its purpose is to ensure that people feel heard before being asked to commit to a path they disagree with. It is incredibly effective at making people feel part of the decisions that are being made.</p>
<p>To apply this specifically to the situation with Covid and our various responses to it; perspective is everything. At that level, *"Do the ends justify the means?"* is an incredibly important question, possibly *THE* single most important one. Because while we, today, may care about specific things, remember, our leaders' job is to think not only about today but about our posterity as well. Killing all humans today would probably save the environment, but wouldn't demonstrate very responsible stewardship! To paint an example.</p>
<p>And this means that where questions of rights are concerned, of the balance of power of the state versus the people, and of how that power is used, perspective is everything and dispassion is important to be able to know you came to a reasoned, effective and meaningful decision -- together.</p>
<p>That has been lost. And when companies like Reddit, Twitter and YouTube aid in the silencing of dissent, it takes a process that is meant to increase the stability of a population and instead creates instability -- as we saw today at the US capitol. When people feel caged, you'll see how much like animals they can really behave.</p>
<p>Is it a worthwhile tradeoff to destroy decades of economic growth - to save 300,000 lives? To increase drug overdose, suicide, mental health problems, across the age and political spectrum, to save those lives? Is that number worthwhile? 1 million? 10 million? At what point do we reach the balance? And there IS a point. Dispassion says that, at one extreme, becoming a draconian totalitarian dictatorship for 10 generations to save exactly 1 life isn't a fair trade (the ends don't justify the means); but at 100 million maybe it is. And at the other extreme, doing exactly nothing is also not reasonable.</p>
<p>So where is the break-even point? This is a worthwhile question and one that has been completely ignored. "Just one life" is not an effective means of making public policy because *there are other things that matter too* that get forgotten when that kind of passion rules our decision making. So being able to dispassionately take a look at a number, without judgement, and ask "what is the correct course of action" is important. This isn't treating people like cattle, it's remembering that using only passion as a guide isn't the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Leaders - politicians - stewards - elected representatives - must do better. Be better. And they aren't.</p>
<p>Sorry for the very long reply but you asked a complex question and it deserved a complete answer.</p>

        <p>You've just said it-- it's only being talked about. Not proven and thus "predicted". These are just hypotheses.

        <p>We oppose the supposed new normalcy of lockinf people up and ending their lives. Lives end all all the time. It should never be in isolation. If we die, we should die free or we should die by the hand of the Beast. If you support Life and Freedom, this is a place for you. Obviously we are scared shitless as well, but life takes precedence.</p>
