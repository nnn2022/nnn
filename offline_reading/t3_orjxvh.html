    <strong>DAE seem like their account has been throttled since joining this sub?</strong>
    <p><p>I have been a Redditor for 7 and 1/2 years. In the beginning I saw the message(s): "Looks like you've been doing that a lot. Take a break for 9 minutes before trying again." quite often. However I haven't been told that in years. Now it seems ANY message I reply to on ANY sub I am getting that message. I fully expect to get that message when I attempt to submit this. I was just wondering if anyone else has had this problem or one's like it since joining this group? That was when I started getting the message again. So basically the little boys and girls who run Reddit can basically shut you out if they don't like what you say. </p>
<p>There's a way around this, the little kids probably don't think about or even know about. Download Dissenter browser. Dissenter allows people to comment on ANY post, on ANY site, every time. You click the little symbol in the address (the dissenter logo) and a drop down appears where people can comment. If we have to, I say everyone get this browser and start commenting there. Reddit wokester's can't do shit about that. </p>
<p>Either way they are achieving their goal. I am getting sick of this crap. There are some communities I rely on, mainly r/CPTSD. I will keep trying but it is depressing. Censorship is B.S.</p></p>

        <p>I haven't had this since my account was pretty new, but I also don't actually make many posts/comments on here, just typically lurking so I'm not sure if maybe they just haven't caught up with me. I was banned from a couple of subs immediately for posting a comment on here my first time, though. You aren't the only person I have seen having this problem, either.</p>

        <p>I made this account specifically for this and related subs and don’t post anywhere else, so I haven’t experienced this. But I don’t doubt it.</p>

        <p>I am probably going to have to, which upsets me because I have made friends and cultivated my account to benefit me. Now I am going to have to make a new name and just use that for certain subs. I cannot even answer you in my messages for another nine minutes. And I am the one who is OP. LOL This stuff is ridiculous. These people are very, very small and really are very ignorant and have NO life experience. Wait until they are 50 and everyone changes everything in their life and screws them up. Wait until they all have mental illness like most adults seem to today. I just cannot imagine being such a small evil person, who throttles a 50 year old guy whom is handicapped, and relies on the r/CPTSD group for help with my personal issues. I cannot post anywhere without having to wait. Even groups that I have triple digit karma and posts in. </p>
<p>I know it's probably some snot faced little shit living in their parents house and are woke as hell and are transitioning from one sex to another, or even to a different species like a lizard or a Star Trek person. They just cannot be an adult and handle me making comments, especially anything concerning our rights and freedoms as Americans. The following is meant for the person screwing with my account:</p>
<p>So to you little man or girl or whatever the hell you call yourself that is screwing with my account, here is my message to you:</p>
<p>You (lefty of course and probably woke as hell) used to be anti-censorship, but the left became children and don't know how to play with others in the sandbox anymore. So they sit on the bench and pout and complain about everything everyone does. I get it, I was beat for my whole childhood, so I understand having trauma inside you. But taking your issues or beliefs out on other people is a very small, cheesy thing to do.</p>
<p>Whoever you are, at least have the balls to confront me and show me who you are. I know you are afraid, because you have read my comments before and know I WOULD find you. But I can promise you I won't hurt you, I just want to know which lefty fruit loop it is.</p>

        <p>Yes, but I attributed it to using VPN.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking it's not censorship since it's not the government that's doing it. Maybe we should find a different, preferably distributed, platform.</p>

        <p>I use a VPN and have tried changing things up but it doesn't matter. It is someone at Reddit themselves who are doing this. Someone who would have the ability to do that. I cannot post anywhere, at anytime without being told I have to wait to post my message. It's probably a good thing that I am an old man and grew up without all this crap, so I know patience and how to use it, Kid's today, especially the woke one's, have no life experience and have no patience. They have had instant everything since they were born. Don't test the patience of an old person LOL</p>
