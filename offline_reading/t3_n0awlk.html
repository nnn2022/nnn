    <strong>We should be concerned...</strong>
    <p><p>One thing is clear, the elites &amp; their little puppets who run our world are nothing but a bunch of Satanic scum who will do anything to make us dumbed down and slowly die off. They don’t care about anything but their money and power, and they’ll do anything to keep it and gain more.</p>
<p>This vaxx they want inside us all, this operating system... They are desperate to make everyone take it. But don’t think for one second that if you refuse your safe. These turds are smarter than you think. The cotton swab pcr test that everyone says, “oh it’s just a test but I don’t want the vaxx” well, whatever‘s in the vaxx is most likely on that swab. Which is why they push it so hard.</p>
<p>Don‘t want vaccine passports? They may say ok, BUT force pcr testing always. Anything to get that chemical into you.</p>
<p>We need to be alert, what ever they want inside us will be placed in foods, medicines and so forth. These fuckers are sneaky! They will be injecting new borns and make this vaccine like a normal booster shot.</p></p>

        <p>Even if that's true, and I don't doubt that it is, at least to some extent, we can still be vigilant and boost our immune systems by living well, taking supplements, and eating healthily.</p>

        <p>Exposure to spike proteins probably is damaging to us; but I don't believe that it makes our own bodies produce more of them, so that is probably something that would go away when exposure is removed. </p>
<p>Also, I doubt the spike protein "dander" alone is capable of assimilating us into the borg... ooops, I mean "Internet of bodies"</p>

        <p>The way that I understand it is that the RNA vax's coded spike protein will be produced by every cell of someone's body, and little bits of those self-replicating bits may be shedded in someone's skin or breath or bodily fluids, basically turning them into a biological weapon spreading more spike proteins. </p>
<p>I've heard rumors from people I know as well as people here on reddit that just being around women who got vaxxed is causing other women's bodies and menstrual cycles to be impacted. I don't see how that would be possible unless they were cross contaminating somehow</p>
<p>Check out any info about chronic wasting disease in deer and other hoofed animals, I fear it may be a similar mechanism</p>

        <p>I said the same thing not long ago- about my suspicion that they will be (if not already doing so) slipping that shiess into everything from mmr Vax to tetanus to a prednisone shot. I will not be letting any of these tools near me with anything they intend to inject or have me otherwise injest</p>
