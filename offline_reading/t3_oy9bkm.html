    <strong>Weaponisation of Behavioral Psychology overshooting the mark in the UK - Mass psychosis: Government advisors agree strategy has been unethical</strong>

<p>We see time and again, in real life and online discussions, that no amount of energy and effort put into arguing with indoctrinated spiteful people, will chance their minds. It's a locked-in syndrome, mass psychosis, induced by month and month (actually 11 years already in the UK) of media propaganda using highly effective tools of behavioral psychology (SPI-B and the Behavioural Insights Team or "nudge unit" in UK) to incrementally change societal behaviour into mass compliance. </p>
<p>But that psychological nudging was so effective that even these agencies are scared of their own creation, seeing that the results overshot their mark by a big margin. I believe many of them don't want a civil war either, but their seed of propaganda efforts fell on already fertile ground, especially in left leaning individuals, through decades of sociatal subversion tactics started by the KBG during the cold war, IMO. That subversion programme (eastern German term : Zersetzung) was more successful then they could ever have dreamed of. It all started with the anti-western /Marxist thought taking root in the hippie counter culture generation. From then the erosive effects were self perpetuating through mostly corrupting academia, but not limited to.</p>

<p>If you are interested watch these lecture or the summarizing interview with Yuri Bezmenov, a Soviet defector, in the 80's.
One could argue that these world views, attitudes, feelings through decades long altering of reality perceptions are now culminating in these diametrically opposed views of the world.....indicated by the introduction of a new concept of "alternative facts". No common ground for discussion anymore to talk about the truth, perceptions and reality any more. The end of science basically. Chaos if not based on a moral integrity, which the western world is lacking a long time already.</p></p>

        <p>I'm not convinced that the ministries are "scared".  They've learned a lot and can bend things more effectively than they thought.</p>
<p>But I have seen relatively intelligent people reduced to fearful mice by consumption of the propaganda.   That is what scares ME.</p>
