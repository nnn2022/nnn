        <p>I wrote this, but change it up a bit here and there. Important points are the parts where its illegal and discriminatory, and also that you won't vote for them again if they don't oppose it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"I beg you to do everything within your power to oppose the planned ‘vaccine passports’. <br>
I might remind you that, as I’m sure you are aware this goes against several international laws and agreements we are not only signed up to but are also founding members of (parliamentary assembly for the council of Europe, UNESCO, Nuremberg codes). The council of Europe resolution is from THIS YEAR and relates to corona directly, so clearly is relevant. 732 states that “ensure that citizens are informed that vaccinations are not mandatory and that no one is politically, socially or otherwise pressured to get vaccinated if they do not wish to do so themselves, and no one is discriminated against for not having been vaccinated”. This explicitly contradicts this. <br>
There are a variety of reasons not to take treatments, we are in a free country, we must have that choice free from coercion. Because that is what this is; this is being used to coerce people into taking experimental medical treatments against their will (which is illegal), and is openly discriminatory. <br>
There is also no reason for to even be justified because the vaccine does not stop people from catch or speeding the disease, so not having a vaccine means that you are putting no one at risk but yourself. <br>
This goes against every moral and ethical code that Britain should stand by, I implore you to do everything you can to stop this going through and challenge it every step of the way. <br>
My greatest fear is that this is a line we cannot cross because this system will go further and be used for other means. As we have been lied to the entire way through the pandemic (including about implementing these passes), we cannot trust the government to have the power to tell it’s citizens they are excluded from society. This will start with nightclubs and “other gatherings” and will eventually extend to any shops or services (as they have done is France). And who’s to say that they won’t also give a credit score, and exclude based on other means, because you may not know, this is how the social credit score in China started.</p>
<p>I beg you please oppose this or you cannot count on my vote again. This is my red line in the sand and I shall be joining the hundreds of thousands like me in protesting in London until this has been stopped. <br>
Thank you<br>
Kind Regards"</p>

        <p>When this petition is finished it will make a great list for going door to door to find the dissenters. I’m not saying not to sign it though. Something has to be done.</p>

        <p>The Government response says it believes in a " Covid status" they are mandating a "vaccine status" a covid status should imply antibodies against the virus either through infection, natural immunity or vaccine</p>
<p>Make sure people know "covid status" is NOT "vaccine status"</p>
