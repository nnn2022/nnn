    <strong>Do you guys think that Taiwan actually beat COVID? Or did they just quit testing early on?</strong>
    <p><p>This may sound like a bit of a stretch but I think this is a decent possibility.</p>
<p>Taiwan and China don't get along so Taiwan knew right from the beginning that those videos in China of people dropping dead on the streets are all fake. So what they did was test a few cases and then mostly stopped, that's why their testing per capita is some of the lowest in the world. They still give the illusion that they're covid free by doing things like border restrictions.</p>
<p>Taiwan didn't even lockdown once. Compared to New Zealand which not only is much less densely populated it has also locked down 3 times. </p>
<p>Since Asians tend to be healthier on average (ie much less obesity) they are much lower risk so the lack of testing doesn't create a bunch of excess deaths.</p>
<p>This is just a theory but I think it's fairly likely.</p>

        <p>I’ve often thought about this.  I think their was another neighboring country of China that resisted lockdowns.  Similar theory, they are well aware of the aggressiveness of China, and have put up with their shenanigans for centuries.  They said, no thanks.</p>

        <p>Vietnam. They didn't not lock down, they just did so isolated and early so they could open sooner. While they were doing so, our Western governments were telling us there was nothing to worry about and it was xenophobic to want border checks.</p>

        <p>If you have a fairly young and healthy population, and you don’t test, there’s absolutely no way you would know there was a virus going around. This could easily be the case with Taiwan. </p>
<p>Being close to China, they might also have more cross immunity with other similar coronaviruses (like the first SARS), other human coronaviruses, or even perhaps some other viruses that have yet to be discovered. Some of these things seem to be endemic to Asia. </p>
<p>The IFR there may be well under 1/1000, which would basically mean you could have widespread circulation, it could be easily swept under the rug.</p>

        <p>Whatever happened in Taiwan is an open question. Don’t let anyone tell you it’s because they locked down harder or the people complied better. Perhaps. Those are hypotheses.</p>

        <p>People likely did comply better because Taiwan hit the people who didn’t with very serious fines, like 20 or 30 thousand US dollars for breaking quarantine.</p>

        <p>I live in Taiwan and assure you there is no evidence of community spread here. Although I disagree with the notion that there were "no lockdowns", as the entire border has been essentially locked down.</p>
<p>As far as community spread, it literally cost $5usd to visit the emergency room at a hospital, and most people will even go for simple colds. If there were community spread, the hospitals would absolutely be slammed.</p>
<p>I think the biggest difference between Taiwan and the other countries was the readiness of the government. Taiwan was hit hardest during SARS, so after the last pandemic they essentially built the infrastructure to ensure it doesn't happen again. At the first sign of a pandemic, all they had to do was flip the switch and follow the SOPs that were already in place.</p>

        <p>The main part that confuses me is that how was there never any community spread when even New Zealand had to lock down 3 times? You'd think it would eventually get into the country somehow.</p>
