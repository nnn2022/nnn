        <p>Many of us are questioning the effectiveness of these strategies being employed by our leaders.  Almost all of it is security theater that doesn't do anything except make it look like something is being done in a situation where nothing really can be done.  Ultimately, the virus has to run its course.</p>

        <p>Of course I understand, all I'm saying is in an ideal world a country would always put it's people's health and wellbeing above money.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what it's like in your country, but in recent years the Pound has remained relatively stable, yet despite that our NHS's funding has been slashed and child poverty has more than doubled since the Tories came to power and decided that Austerity was the best thing to "Save the Economy"</p>
<p>What I want isn't practical, it may not even be doable, all I know it's a country's economic strength rarely affects the little people; the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.</p>

        <p>Because we spent over $3 trillion because of this and 40 million people lost their jobs.  It seems unnecessary to go from record low unemployment to record high unemployment in the course of 2 months for something that has a mortality rate of 0.26%, and that's including nursing home deaths.  If you're under 70 you pretty much have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>edit: In case you wanted a source on the extremely low mortality rate statistic.

        <p>I can say the same about influenza, as the mortality rate is about the same for under 70. Even less for people under 21 and zilch for kids.</p>
<p>Do YOU think it is right governments forcing lockdowns basing our policies on public health from an authoritarian, communist government that has concentration camps and welds people into their homes? Do YOU think our civil rights are important? Apparently not.</p>

        <p>I think you’re right. It’s ethical differences. I consider loss of quality of life, hopes, dreams, and opportunities to be more tragic and cruel than loss of life in people who are already close to death. I realize there are outliers, but covid deaths overwhelmingly affect the elderly and those with serious chronic conditions. We could help vulnerable groups protect themselves while letting the rest of life go on. To me, it’s wrong on a biological level to ask the young to sacrifice for the old.</p>
<p>So the difference between us is not that I dislike lockdowns and isolation measures more than you do. It’s that I believe they’re morally wrong.</p>

        <p>Then we've reached a pretty mature conclusion I'd say, neither of us is going to convince the other to put aside their ethical opinion so I'll just have to agree to disagree, I really do appreciate hearing your point of view, even if I'm being downvoted for it lol</p>

        <p>I can’t deal with people who think this way. It’s insulting to frontline workers who are risking their lives for Karen’s and entitled people to go places without masks. It’s insulting to older people and higher risk people as they are made to stay in longer because you are spreading it more. I don’t like how I’m being told to stay in but I do it so it would be over sooner.</p>

        <p>No. One more time, I’m saying that I care MORE about the losses resulting from lockdown and restrictions than about the extra loss of life that may result from a more balanced strategy. I consider the loss of hopes, dreams and opportunities to be MORE TRAGIC than the loss of life in people who (for the most part) are near death anyway. </p>

        <p>Every time anybody with any contagious respiratory illness goes out, they risk infecting someone who risks infecting someone who risks infecting someone who risks infecting a vulnerable person who could die. It has always been that way. That’s just life on a planet shared by humans and microbes. We cannot be responsible for the health of everyone within 10 degrees of separation. Society cannot function that way. I am not breaking any laws or doing anything deliberate to make other people sick, but living my life does not make me a killer.

        <p>Really easy.. don't visit the older relative (unless of course they are fine with it.) We don't visit my 80 year old father, but he doesn't want his grandchildren to sacrifice their lives to "save" hypothetical old people. </p>
<p>My mom literally died of a cold that went into pneumonia. It never crossed my mind to blame whoever she got the cold from for "killing her". That is just ridiculous logic and completely unprecedented in society, we literally could not function with this thought process.</p>
<p>At risk people have always had to take more precautions when it comes to viruses. I have lost two friends to leukemia. When one of them had a bone marrow transplant, SHE wore a (high quality) mask to go out when her immune system was down. Visitors had to take special precautions. She wouldn't have gone out in crowd. She didn't demand the world shut down to protect her.</p>

<p>Nah, a life lived in fear isn't much of a life.</p>
<p>“A coward dies a thousand times before his death, but the valiant taste of death but once. It seems to me most strange that men should fear, seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come.”</p>

<p>Holy shit, dude. Everyone <em>experiences</em> fear at some points in their lives. But you shouldn't be living your life in constant fear. And you shouldn't be allowing irrational fears to prevent you from doing the things that make life worth living.</p>

        <p>&rt;You shouldn’t put others at risk for your own benefit then. </p>
<p>Your complete lack of any sense of proportionality is frankly bizarre. As I put it previously:</p>
<p>Lately, I've seen a disturbing number of people on reddit say things like "your rights (e.g., to leave your home, travel freely in public, peacefully assemble, etc.) end at my immune system" or "you don't have the right to put others at risk of getting sick and dying (by going outside)." That is a jaw-droppingly ridiculous position to take.  </p>
<p>Infectious disease is an ever-present fact of human existence.  <em>Any time</em> you go out in public, you are potentially exposing those you encounter to whatever pathogens you might unknowingly be carrying, just as you yourself are potentially being exposed to whatever pathogens those individuals are carrying.  But life involves risk. And the fact that you, and those you encounter, still chose to go out in public indicates that you all believed the benefits of doing so outweighed the risks. If you want to barricade yourself in your home for the next six months (or the rest of your life), only venturing out onto your front porch in a hazmat suit every few weeks to pick up delivered supplies, you have the right to make that choice. But you <em>don't</em> have the right to forcibly impose that choice on others via the violence of the state.  </p>
<p>It's also worth noting that infectious disease is killing dramatically fewer people than at any time in human history:  </p>
<p>&rt;In 1900, the top 3 causes of death were infectious diseases—pneumonia and flu, tuberculosis, and gastrointestinal infections (a fourth infectious disease, diphtheria, was the 10th leading cause of death). Improvements in sanitation, public health (vaccination development and delivery), and medical treatments, such as antibiotics, led to dramatic declines in deaths from infectious diseases during the 20th century. As the impact of these diseases has been reduced or eliminated, mortality rates from other causes, especially chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer, have increased, and new diseases, such as noninfectious airways diseases, diabetes, and suicide, are now among the top 10 causes of death.</p>
<p>https://www.ncdemography.org/2014/06/16/mortality-and-cause-of-death-1900-v-2010/</p>
<p>And today when an infectious illness is the "cause" of mortality, it's frequently really more the proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back of an already very old and sickly person, a dynamic that's clearly at work in the case of COVID-19.</p>
<p>https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Sex-Age-and-S/9bhg-hcku</p>
<p>The idea that the mere existence of infectious disease (or one particular middlingly-dangeous infectious disease like COVID-19) somehow suddenly justifies ceding all of our most basic freedoms to a totalitarian state is <em>fucking insane</em>.</p>

        <p>Okay then. A+ for the essay. Maybe less people are dying from viruses because we found cures or suppressants? Maybe people are dying from Covid-19 cause it’s new? Last time I checked, ‘careful’ and ‘bizarre’ mean two different things</p>

        <p>&rt; Maybe less people are dying from viruses because we found cures or suppressants? </p>
<p>Yes, of course that's a huge factor.  </p>
<p>&rt;Maybe people are dying from Covid-19 cause it’s new?</p>
<p>Yes, that's almost certainly a factor that's making it deadlier than many other viruses. Although in the grand scheme of things, the number of people dying from it is still very small (despite having a large population of elderly and frail people).  </p>
<p>Consider that the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic killed an estimated 50 million worldwide (the population-adjusted equivalent of <em>200 million</em> today), including 675,000 Americans (the population-adjusted equivalent of <em>2 million</em> today). And unlike the current virus which targets overwhelmingly the very old and the very sick, the Spanish Flu's victims included many children and otherwise-healthy young adults:</p>
<p>&rt;Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years old, 20-40 years old, and 65 years and older. The high mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20-40 year age group, was a unique feature of this pandemic.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html</p>
<p>For some more context, consider the 1957 and 1968 pandemics:</p>
<p>The CDC estimates total US deaths from the 1957 "Asian Flu" pandemic at 116,000, and total US deaths from the 1968 "Hong Kong Flu" pandemic at 100,000.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1957-1958-pandemic.html</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1968-pandemic.html</p>
<p><strong>Today, those numbers would be the population-adjusted equivalent of around 222,000 deaths and 165,000 deaths, respectively.</strong></p>
<p>And that's before you take into consideration the fact that the US populations in 1957 and 1968 were significantly younger and healthier than today's.  Around 80% of US COVID-19 deaths have been individuals 65 and older. Today, that demographic represents around 15% of the population versus around 9-10% in '57 and '68.  Obesity also appears to represent a significant risk factor in predicting COVID-19 deaths.  Today, around 40% of Americans are classified as obese versus only around 10-12% in '57 and '68.</p>
<p>If the '57 and '68 pandemics had hit a US population with the same age and health characteristics as today's, the death tolls would almost certainly have been substantially higher.  If you add a 50% adjustment for the age and health factors (which I think is clearly <em>conservative</em>), on top of the previous adjustments for total population size, you'd get 333,000 deaths for the '57 pandemic and 247,500 deaths for the '68 pandemic.</p>

<p>&rt;What I’m saying is be considerate of people who can die from it. </p>
<p>Thanks for the pro-tip.  But yes, being considerate is good.  Wash your hands. Stay home if you're sick. Be even more conscientious if you live with or frequently interact with someone who's elderly or immune-compromised.  Also be especially considerate of other people's fundamental liberties, e.g., their rights to earn a living, peacefully assemble, socialize, gather for worship, etc.</p>
<p>&rt;Don’t just think of yourself when going out.</p>
<p>Or when staying home. You might be content with watching e-sports and eating grubhub-delivered Taco Bell, but not everyone is.</p>

<p>No idea how my age, race, sexual orientation, state of residence, or given name would be relevant to this conversation. And I know how to use a computer. (Hint: I'm using one now.) I've actually worked exclusively from home for years.</p>
<p>&rt;People need to adapt, like watch a Netflix show, buy a PS4, read a book.</p>
<p>Thanks, but I already have a Netflix subscription, a PS4, and own many books, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzx8KHjQD6c">many of them leather-bound</a>.  And <em>why</em> do they need to adapt? You've done nothing to establish that lockdowns represent a proportionate response to the threat posed by this virus (and nothing to rebut my arguments to the contrary). You've done nothing to prove that they represent an effective response, nor to prove that any marginal benefits they <em>might</em> provide in the form of a reduced death toll from COVID-19 won't be absolutely <em>dwarfed</em> by their harmful second-order effects (e.g., increased joblessness, poverty, suicide, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, infringement of fundamental liberties, etc.).</p>

        <p>Exactly! People at higher risk need to take precautions for themselves, like my friends with leukemia did. No one expected society to shut down for them so they wouldn't catch something.
By "hypothetical old people" I mean the argument you keep making... "people who go out COULD spread the virus and kill someone!" We don't see any high risk or elderly people, so we couldn't spread the virus to anyone we know, anyone who died in some long chain of infection connected to my family would be hypothetical.</p>

        <p>Your question was would I rather get the virus, and I answered yes, I would rather take that risk. Others can make different choices. People who don't want to take any risks can make the choice to be more careful than I would be. I won't intentionally be in close contact with people who are at high risk, so I'm not part of the problem.</p>

        <p>I disagree with your assessment about how the virus spreads and the science isn't on your side, but even if true there are no laws or orders against any of the things you mentioned, so I guess you are advocating we go even further than current lockdowns and literally shut everyone inside with food delivery?</p>

        <p>I’m saying if you carry it, and touch your face or cough into your hand, then open a door in public that’ll spread it. That seems more scientific than ‘I know what I’m doing, I’ll take the risk’. The lockdowns in place are fine, it’s just some people just don’t follow them for their own personal agenda.</p>

        <p>I’ll keep washing my hands and using hand sanitizer before and after touching things like grocery carts. As I always have, even before Covid. Everyone else can easily do the same as we have been being told for months. Wash your hands use hand sanitizer avoid touching your face. Every study out there shows close indoor contact is the main route of transmission.</p>

        <p>I wear masks when required to do so and respect people’s preferences for maintaining distance. And if you read my earlier post, I was referring to other infectious diseases, not cancer. We’ve always accepted that people with flus or colds might go out and involuntarily cause a chain of infection that results in death. With covid we call this murder. Doesn’t seem logical to me.</p>

        <p>"What sort of life do we think we are protecting? There is more to life than the avoidance of death. Life is a drink with friends. Life is a crowded football match or a live concert. Life is a family celebration with children and grandchildren. Life is companionship, an arm around one’s back, laughter or tears shared at less than two metres. These things are not just optional extras. They are life itself. They are fundamental to our humanity, to our existence as social beings. Of course death is permanent, whereas joy may be temporarily suspended. But the force of that point depends on how temporary it really is.”</p>

        <p>My children and many of my friends are losing opportunities in work and in love. If there were an end in sight I would shrug and suck it up. It’s the people who are prepared to hobble society and basic human nature “for as long as it takes” who scare the shit out of me.</p>
<p>Also, Amazon and UberEats hardly represent the businesses I’m concerned about.</p>

        <p>Why cause we care about our future? If we carry on being cooped up, we will get to an end. People who share the same mindset as you have just given up and quit. How can you lose opportunities in love? Maybe two people aren’t compatible? If your children are in school, they aren’t losing opportunities if they do online classes. Adults also have the option to work from home so no opportunities are lost</p>

<p>Most of us on this sub don't see it that way. We've watched the goalposts move further and further away, time and time again. We've watched the public support longer and longer restrictions. We've watched people's risk tolerance shrink to zero. The virus is likely to become endemic, and based on what we've seen so far we expect that people will want to keep restrictions going in perpetuity. To us, this cure is worse than the disease. This is why we favour policies that enable us to adapt to the virus, rather than policies based on avoiding it at all costs.</p>

        <p>Research changes. Also your logic is extremely flawed. ‘Oh if a vaccine comes out to treat it and it disappears it’ll be horrible!’ no. just no Helen or Karen or Linda or something like that. People are applying logic to the situation that’s why risk tolerance is shrinking and why goalposts are moving further away. Because people like to be careful and care for others not just their family.</p>

<p>What if it's not about a virus? We know that certain elements in our society have long wanted to rule over us with an iron rod, with world government and a dystopic, Orwellian surveillance regime. Certain elements have been caught, red-handed, blackmailing public officials. What if this element is making their big move under the guise of a "pandemic"? What if we only have a  brief window of time in order to resist, before the prison door closes tightly and all human freedom is destroyed on planet Earth? Would you be brave enough to fight it?</p>
