    <strong>Support the unvaccinated however we can, the time is now</strong>
    <p><p>The unvaccinated are going to need a place to stay surviving this segregation from society </p>
<p>They will need food water and shelter as they will be suffering financially for their fight for our freedom. </p>
<p>They will need businesses to help support them from being ostracized from society. </p>
<p>They will need people, bosses and businesses owners to help fight for their employment to keep themselves and their families afloat. </p>
<p>I would encourage all of you to stay safe at the same time. Although please understand that there is sacrifice for freedoms. We cannot enjoy living free in this world without fighting for it. I would personally rather fight now before it gets worse than it already is.</p>
<p>EDIT: We should create a charity for this cause, different groups around different areas under their own names. We should have a professional process for people to apply for support with interviews, screenings and questionaries to pair people with the proper support they may need.</p></p>

        <p>I think a lot of small businesses will step up and start selling basic supplies when the big chains lock people out for being unvaccinated. It’s going to be difficult to fill the gap of places like Walmart and Kroger, especially in small towns where choices are so limited. But we own a small gun business, and we have been discussing as this gets worse, of turning part of our store into a corner shop, ie, selling basic non perishable food and household supplies. When this really gets going, it’s going to happen fast. We all have to be ready to step up and support eachother, and we’ll have to be flexible and creative about it.</p>

        <p>This is why small business support is so important, in I try to stay away from supporting big businesses even if that means I’m spending the extra dollar. </p>
<p>Spreading out the power and utilizing our system of checks and balances. When one power fails us, we have something to fall back on, but not if communism is in effect, then we’ll have no power to fall back on when the main one fails; because we would have put all our eggs into one basket.</p>

        <p>My daughter had a dream over a year ago that my family got kicked out of our town.  My other daughter had a dream four years ago that there were people walking by our house throwing things and yelling- it confused her and it felt really real.  I’m  sure that this is a long-con where we will eventually have no where to go IN SOCIETY and will be completely removed from it.</p>

        <p>I was thinking interviews, and questionnaires. </p>
<p>That’s a good question though. We could utilize those apps they are trying to use against us the unvaccinated to see who is vaccinated and who isn’t for our programs. </p>
<p>I’m curious those about how to set this all up too. I don’t think it should be one big organization, the government would take that down. </p>
<p>I want to say we should spread it out within our own communities, reach out over social media, in our social groups neighbor to neighbor and support each other. We could have our own communities for their own support systems for their area, a few in each city or town.</p>
