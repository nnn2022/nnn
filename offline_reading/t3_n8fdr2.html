    <strong>Why Did You Teach Me Science In School?</strong>
    <p><p>You started teaching me simple science in kindergarten.  </p>
<p>In college, you demanded I take three more years of science, even though I was a music and language major.  </p>
<p>For 16 years, you forced me to dedicate one hour to science every day.  You made me cut animals open.  You made me breed fruit flies.  You made me get up before dawn to record the time and place of the sun rising.  You taught me, in depth, about DNA, bacteria, viruses, and vaccines.</p>
<p>I liked science.</p>
<p>I watched The Learning Channel before they rebranded themselves ... when they still broadcast science programs.  I watched Wild Kingdom and National Geographic to learn about animal behavior.  I watched Cosmos to learn about the stars.</p>
<p>I still read about science.  I would read more academic papers, but I can't afford them.</p>
<p>But with COVID ... I am reminded DAILY that none of that science was good enough.  All the biology I learned was apparently garbage ... was all the other science you taught me garbage, too?  It makes me wonder ... does the sun actually rise in the west?  Maybe the Earth IS the center of the universe.   Maybe male birds don't have flashier plumage.  Maybe there is no such thing as the jet stream.</p></p>

        <p>I know this infuriates me so much like when they call me a science denier and it’s some fat Karen in the shop who left school at 16 with no GCSEs except in drama, and I’m actively studying science in university about to graduate yet I’m a science denier for reading papers, research and studies and coming to an informed decision</p>
