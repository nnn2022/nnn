        <p>I personally didn't lost any friends. I mean, I'm not in touch with a bunch of people who I thought were my friends, but that's about it. To put it in more correct terms, I suppose, it was an experiance that allowed me to figure out who my friends are.</p>

        <p>I lost two friends about a year ago. They both received a positive test for COVID-19. Thanks to the media, they were convinced that having COVID-19 meant that you were practically guaranteed to die a slow painful death on a ventilator, while you would also kill anybody you went near. </p>
<p>One OD'd to avoid dying on a ventilator. The other had nowhere to go other than back home to his wife and kid, so he hung himself to prevent them from catching it.</p>
<p>Both were healthy and in their 20s, so their chances of survival were extremely high. Both deaths were recorded as COVID-19 deaths though. </p>
<p>I also have a friend whose mother died from a heart attack as the nearby hospitals were supposedly full with COVID-19 patients and wouldn't admit her.</p>

        <p>People are not behaving rationally at the moment though. </p>
<p>For example, the guy whose mother died from a heart attack claims that he knows that the closest hospital had room to accept her. Yet he justifies her death by saying that the hospital needed to keep those beds empty in case there was a surge of COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>If the same thing had happened in 2019 her death would have been all over the media.</p>

        <p>This is absolutely heartbreaking. The fear/hysteria/isolation has done more damage to people’s livelihood than COVID itself ever could have. I hope you’re doing well.</p>
<p>I remember back in April of last year, two dudes in my town stabbed each other during an altercation where they were both accusing the other of secretly having COVID and were paranoid that the other was lying about it. </p>
<p>Turns out they had both tested positive and it was just the pot calling the kettle black. When I first heard about this, all I could picture in my head was that Spider-Man meme - but then I thought about how sad it was that two guys stabbed/almost killed each other over a virus that has more than a 99% survival rate.</p>

        <p>This is the turning point where people pick the State/Government/Elite over their family. It's sad, but they wanted this breakdown. Without nuclear families, the individual is oh so easy to control.</p>

        <p>I’ve left judgement up to them. Their take on this shit is their own and I respect it however batshit crazy it is. I haven’t cut ties with anyone because of what they think, but some of them can’t get over the fact that I haven’t taken any of it seriously and have stopped talking to me. Being friends with me is easy, I’ll be friends with anybody, but I’m not going to change who I am to appease anyone.</p>
