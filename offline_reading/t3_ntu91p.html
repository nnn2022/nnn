    <strong>I do not get it</strong>
    <p><p>I am not here to get anyone mad, im just curious, so please just explain everything because i really do not get it.</p>
<p>Why do you think that everything is just a hoax and a big conspiracy theory? 
Multiple family members of mine as well as people i know got covid. While only one of them went to a hospital i really dont think that its fake. Yes - most of the cases are a like a flu but a bit worse its still something that actually hurts people and it exists. I didnt just watch TV or media I witnessed people being ill of that.</p>
<p>Why would you call someone a sheep for wearing a mask?
IF it has a chance to protect others why wouldnt you want to wear a mask? Based on my own experience ( as well as family and friends ) its not preventing you from breathing, its just mildly annoying. I'd rather have that little inconvenience if it might prevent someone from being ill.</p>
<p>Vaccines?
We know how they work and why they work and it is free in Europe. I know that it might have negative side effects for people who have allergies or other things that might get it all complicated, but for a person who has no such things it will not do much except the typical thing that come with taking almost any vaccine. 
( As a person who had an allervic reaction to a vaccine when i was a baby i understand why some people in similar situations might not want to take it, but i dont get why a healthy adult wouldnt. )</p>
<p>Goverment controll??
Ive seen something like this pop up here and there and if the goverment REALLY wanted to controll you so badly wouldnt they just use your drivers license or passport or whatever other document is in their data base ? Arent we basically controlled by laws and law enforcment when we live in a country that has a government?</p></p>

        <p>I don’t think covid as in the virus itself is fake. I think I had it over a year ago, after my roommate at the time got back from China.</p>
<p>I think all the restrictions have been completely unnecessary after maybe like the first month when things were still being figured out.</p>
<p>I have nothing against people who choose to wear masks for whatever reason, but I hate masks. I didnt even care if it was for 20 minutes at the grocery store but try wearing one for 14 hours a day and see how you like it.</p>
<p>I don’t trust the vaccine because. -it’s not fully approved by the FDA -it’s an experimental technology -it was rushed -a lot of people have died or had horrific side effects -I don’t need it because I’m 32 and healthy, if I get sick I’ll stay home.</p>

        <p>Mask does not prevent spread. That fact is supported by a lot of evidence, most of all lack of statistical difference between "masked" and "unmasked" regions. We do not know how the vaccines work, since most of the information is controlled and analyzed by the entities with an explicit conflict of interests, and the trials were rushed and lacking necessary phases. Serious adverse effects of respiratory viruses are not unique and there have always been heart complications, kidney removals and deaths of quite young people. Government control is very much about justifying the means. Convincing population to rejects their rights "for the common good" gives them way more power then they have any right to. Disrupting further already corrupted democratic processes assures that the elites retain their positions. Governments place various limits and regulations, often arbitrary and overcautious (to put it mildly), meaning they don't trust the people, yet they demand that people trust them, despite their proven and obvious corruption, hypocrisy and lack of transparency. If the elites have the motives, the means and the opportunity to conduct what can be described as malicious conspiracies, and something strange and suspicious is indeed going on, are people to presume that the rich and the authorities have absolutely nothing to do with it and it's all just coincidences. Politics and ideology don't work like scientific method and Occam's razor - and there are objections to use of Occam's razor in science too.</p>

        <p>The virus is not as serious as the media/governments say that it is. We should never have shut down everything over this virus. Nobody on here says that the virus is fake. This virus has over a 99.5% survival rate.</p>
<p>My doctor says that healthy people should not wear masks. Masks do nothing to stop the spread of a virus. Even Fauci admits this. Also, look on the side of the mask box, it clearly states it too.</p>
<p>No vaccine is 100% safe. All vaccines carry the risk of side effects and death. Yes, death. Look at any vaccine insert and it will clearly state this. As far as this vaccine, it was developed way too quickly. Not enough tests were done. We have no idea what the long term side effects from this vaccine will be. In the USA, it is not FDA approved. Basically, you are like a lab rat and they are experimenting on you if you get this vaccine. Also, plenty of side effects and death have been documented with this covid vaccine.</p>
<p>Government control - Yes, that is real. All governments seek to control people.</p>

        <p>Okay, I'll split this up.</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't. There's no proof. However, the suspicion comes when you see that rich people have benefited from this, there is incentive. Pair that with fearmongering and flip flopping, I wouldn't exactly call how the government has acted trustworthy. Honestly, ask someone else that question.</li>
</ol>
<p>And again, I don't think that covid is fake. It's obviously real. It's just overblown. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1">Here are the death rates by age from the CDC. </a>This is not the end of the world. What I know is fake is the idea that their is a need for non-pharmaceutical interventions that have debatable effectiveness, but most importantly a need for lockdowns with all the damage the wreak upon society. Covid isn't fake, but the fear surrounding is unreasonable. Infection sucks, but we live with pathogens, we have to put up with being ill sometimes. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don't necessarily call mask wearers sheep. If you're wearing an n95 in an environment where there are high risk people (such as hospitals), then okay, you're being cautious but it's based in having thought about it. However, most people wear a dirty bit of fabric to keep up appearances, or so they can say they care when they just want people to like them. Or it's just to go with the flow. Point is, it's based in social pressure, not research. With masks, the effectiveness is very debatable. Our best evidence, an <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">RCT study</a> is inconclusive, for example. We don't know if we're giving substantial protection to ourselves or to others, so sure, wear one of you want, but no mandates. I am against mandates, not masks themselves. I don't care if anyone chooses to wear them, it's the forcing it on everyone that I take issue with. Mask mandates have social consequences on how we have treated each other, and also cause more ocean plastic pollution. Don't force policy with consequences based on conflicting, inconclusive evidence. It's a little inconvenience for you, but not for everyone. And that, as I say, is not the point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With vaccines, the issue is what we don't know. I know I am not at risk from covid more than other everyday risks, due to my age and health. However, I do not know what risk I'm taking with the vaccine. They usually take at least a decade to prepare, and there's no getting around the fact that we've had no opportunity to get long term evidence, so we don't have it. Thus, I cannot make an informed decision because I don't have the information that I need, and since I'm not bothered by my risk in the first place, so I'll stay as I am unless evidence says vaccination is the right choice for me, and it'll be some time before we have that evidence. It'd either be based in peer pressure, or blind trust, and you should not blindly trust anything ever. If people are at genuine risk, then I totally get why they want to be vaccinated. They will then be protected. Their decision. Even if they aren't at risk, their decision still. It affects them. Same as with masks, I am not against vaccines themselves, simply being forced into a decision that could badly affect me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one can deny that the government has been micromanaging our lives since this started. In fact, some of the stuff happening (like curfews) are downright dystopian. Our rights are supposed to protect us from things like that, yet they were disregarded. The precedent that they can be discarded whenever an emergency is declared (even if that emergency isn't actually that dangerous) is frankly awful, and we cannot allow it. I don't know what the government want, but I know they're not some all loving entity and must be challenged and questioned like anything else. They work for us, public service, so they don't get to say when we can have our rights. That's not conditional, not up to them. Laws that uphold rights have been walked all over. And laws are not micromanagement, they deal with actual crimes and protecting people from danger that can be directly caused by another person, at least that department of law. Emergency measures have been put in place which are not laws, the were not voted on or properly debated, just shoved at us on a whim. That is not how a free society works.</p>
