    <strong>Has being a skeptic made you closer with somebody?</strong>
    <p><p>We have heard the stories of people falling out with lovers, friends or family members because of their lockdown views but on the other hand has being a lockdown skeptic made you closer with someone because they have similar views as you?</p></p>

        <p>Yes 100%. Not anyone I knew before, but I go to a gym that is in a county well known for bucking the governor’s restrictions to some extent. I started going there because it’s the only gym I can find that doesn’t require masks to workout. I think we all kind of feel the same about this stuff (I see a lot of don’t tread on me flags in the lot, and it’s clear their business has gone up since the mandates-people looking for a gym that doesn’t require them), but I’ve gotten talking to a few of the people there about all this and have become friends with them based on our mutual views. It’s really really nice, these are people I never would have met otherwise but somehow we passed each other in the gym and make a comment about how annoying it is they have CNN on the TV or something random, and we got to talking and bam friends. It’s so so nice.</p>

        <p>Most definitely. And with some fairly unsuspecting people who I was decent acquaintances with before but now we talk all the time and hang out and go to restaurants together and I just generally feel more solidarity with them. Also made me way closer to my parents who are extremely anti lockdown. I’m 31 but I’m considering going back to live with them because they’d go to bars and shit with me LOL</p>

        <p>My husband, honestly. Not that anything was "wrong" in the first place but he and I are very different people... This has absolutely brought us closer.</p>

        <p>Yes. I was rather estranged from my aunt, who is very religious, after having come out.</p>
<p>She started sending me links to skeptic articles and videos (mind you I was already having skeptical thoughts by then). It seemed we were on the same page. We began sharing articles we would find on the internet - we have now been talking every day ever since, sharing information and having a good old rant over the phone about this madness. Feel this is the closest we’ve ever been.</p>
<p>I am quite vocal of my thoughts IRL and on social media, and I’ve had a few friends confide in me - I’m someone they can talk to to discuss things.</p>
<p>I have fallen out with quite a few friends - a common trend with those people it that they have been in university for years and are doing PhDs. Not working full time. Not sure what to make of that!</p>

        <p>Yes 
I had a mate I was semi mates with, like someone who hangs with your mate but talk on a surface level </p>
<p>But this guy was waking up to this bullshit and now we basically talk everyday and discuss about the bs that's happening 
And with family my dad and step dad have been a lot closer with me and we both now have a topic that we're strongly passionate about "dissecting the new normal" but also theirs been a few people who cut me off or distant due to my view which is whatever</p>

        <p>Definitely my husband. At first we were both a little hesitant to say anything controversial to each other. We’ve only been together since November 2019 and in April when this got bad we didn’t want to say anything that would spoil the relationship.</p>
