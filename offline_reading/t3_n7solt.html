    <strong>What is your opinion on the emergence of new potentially deadly variants of covid?</strong>
    <p><p>Since the majority of this subreddit is anti covid vaccine, im curious on your stance regarding new strains/mutations.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible that a new and significantly deadlier variant can emerge, and avoiding vaccinations only increases those odds. Do you guys believe in this possibility, and if so, why not just get the vaccine?</p></p>

        <p>The variants are blatant attempts by the media in fearmongering and prolonging the pandemic. Viruses tend to mutate into less deadly but more transmissable forms. In addition, all vaccines have been shown to be effective against variants. Do your own research instead of letting fear rule your life.</p>

<p>The variants are tools to justify protracting the government's authority over businesses and individuals- allowing them to destroy lives and livelihoods "for the greater good".</p>

        <p>These variants wouldn’t have a chance to mutate if we didn’t keep people in lockdowns. 
if a disease is allowed to pass through society quickly like every other instance in history heard immunity is reached quickly and those who are worried about getting sick could return to the fold. Lockdowns and social distancing only weakens a species and drags out a virus giving it room to thrive. 
You can see evidence of this in all the places that did not impose any restrictions although they had a spike at the start the numbers are now the lowest in the world this is how nature works we cannot pretend we are immune to the ebb and flow of the natural world populations swell and then die. Fighting it only causes suffering. The vaccines are not traditional vaccines using small portions of spike proteins, what if these new variants loose those proteins because of this immunity then the vaccine does nothing but give people blood clots and god knows what else</p>

        <p>Bingo.  This man is a sage.</p>
<p>Immunity is all about keeping your flesh vessel as strong, vibrant, and resilient as possible.</p>
<p>We know how, the knowledge is there and there are no shortcuts: diet and exercise bitches!</p>
<p>If you cower about living a normal life then you are going to be weak and untested against even mild pathogens. </p>
<p>Get out there, expose yourself to life.  We also live in a global world,  so aside from small uncontacted jungle tribes you no longer have entire populations unable to develop immunity via natural exposure over time.</p>
<p>Isolation is the worst possible thing for development of an immune system.</p>

<p>If I chose not to drink coffee, would you say I’m “anti coffee”?</p>

<p>As almost everything related to this “pandemic” has been politicized (ie, potentially lifesaving hydroxychloroqin) I tend to be very skeptical about headlines like “potentially deadly”. </p>

<li>
<p>Viruses tend to produce variants that are LESS lethal as they try to survive. Dead host = dead virus and no transmission. </p>

<p>Have you considered the variants might be a survival mechanism partially CAUSED by the vaccine?</p>

<p>It was literally found to be more harmful than good. You’ll praise this dangerous treatment, but will turn your nose to a vaccine which was found through extensive trials to be safe and effective? I don’t understand you people</p>

        <p>This “vaccine type” has been extensively studied for 3 decades.</p>
<p>And you’re right, it is your body so it’s your choice. And your choice now puts you at risk of contracting a brand new virus that is known to cause long term damage and side effects after recovery, even in mild cases. </p>
<p>Seems kinda stupid to me to decide to not take a vaccine which has had no observed long term effects (which is your fear I presume), and choose to catch covid (and you will eventually) which has been documented to commonly cause long term damage... where’s the logic</p>

        <p>Studied? Maybe. Used on a broad scale? No. Also it’s clearly not a “brand new” virus. Just a different COVID strain. They will never stop coming in new strains, there will just be a constant push for new lockdowns, shots and restrictions to “save” us all. Go start your advocation for a 15 mph speed limit. Roads are far more deadly than COVID.</p>

        <p>The “vaccines” are clinical trials approved for emergency use only it says so right on the bottle! There is no research on these trials because we simply haven’t had enough time to see what happens. Why would i choose to be a lab rat for a experimental vaccine for a disease which the chance of me dying is almost statistically zero?</p>

<p>You do know that the bogus study used to "prove" that it was dangerous was retracted less than a month after it was released, right? Don't be blinded because of your myopic view that OrAnGe MaN bAd. </p>
<p>HCQ has been used since the 1950s and it's asinine to even suggest that it's poisonous. There were no extensive trials for any of the vaccines because they were done in under 6 months and given EUA. If you get jabbed, then you are the Phase 3 ferret that the vaxx manufacturers didn't have time to use. It is also evident that you didn't even read the papers that the companies published to determine what 'safe and effective' actually means.</p>

        <p>For me the biggest concern is that by promoting the use of leaky vaccines (vaccines which do not offer 100% protection), we might actually help to produce deadlier variants of COVID. This already happened with either chickens or pigs, but I forgot which was the example given.</p>

        <p>All they say they know for sure with the vaccine is it is good at preventing death and hospitalization. They do not know if it prevents infection though. So why would being vaccinated stop it from mutating as well? You're still getting infected, it's just supposed to make it milder.</p>

        <p>Variants will emerge, there is honestly little we can do to control mutations of viruses. We aren't in control of nature, we aren't above it. The potential threat of a possible variant emerging that is possibly more deadly is all theoretical, not a reason to pressure or even force vaccinations. And if it did happen, I'd reconsider my risk with that in mind, and make a decision on taking the vaccine again. Though unfortunately, until we're properly informed with the associated risks of the vaccines it is very difficult to risk assess properly.</p>

        <p>It's possible but unlikely, because deadlier variants don't spread as easily as milder ones, and they get outcompeted and fizzle out (usually).</p>
<p>I don't trust the "vaccine," I have natural immunity, and I'm not scared of variants. I'd never get a gene therapy for anything, no matter what.</p>
