    <strong>Having a hard time being close to friends and family that I have to hide my feelings on all of this.</strong>
    <p><p>They know I’m not getting the vaccine but let’s face it, they were a type of doomer and it’s pretty depressing I feel like I have to hide my opinions on lockdowns, masking, the virus, vaccines, and even religion (as another separate topic.)</p>
<p>I’ve always felt like an imposter and a fake, but maybe I just don’t have any friends/family who really know me.</p>
<p>Anyone else feel this way?</p></p>

        <p>No, you let your opinions be known to them. They are not your family or friends if you can not be yourself around them.</p>

        <p>Some of us wouldn't have anyone left. For survival, I can't piss off every person I know out there. I'm on the spectrum so most think I am weird anyway. Be yourself in this world is often bad advice. :/ If I let it all out there'd be no friends left. I am taking a "its your medical decision stance" with the majority who even know my details. If I told them what I really thought the vaccines were about outside of two online conspiracy friends, there'd be no friends left at all. Family is long gone, their love of the system separated me long ago.</p>

        <p>I understand where you’re coming from. Everyone wants to belong, but why belong with people who would outcast you for your views?</p>
<p>Are those people the type you want in your life? Will these people help you when shit gets really?</p>
<p>Personally, I would rather be completely alone then be “friends” with people that cannot tolerate the way I live.</p>

        <p>I had a co-worker that is in her early 60’s and she was afraid of the virus. I straight up told her “well, I guess at least it’ll fix social security.” Moral of the story is, fuck what anybody else thinks. What I’ve learned from this whole stupid fucking situation is that you can only rely on yourself. I’ve been loud and outspoken since the first hypocritical rules started rolling out.</p>

        <p>I understand why you're hiding. I've left a cult before, it was much the same as this. </p>
<p>I think these experiences are necessary for becoming a whole person who is secure in who they are - which means being secure enough to let people know when you're not ok with something, no matter how that makes them feel. That doesn't mean being a dick, or trying to reverse-proselytize to them about not getting the vaccine - but just saying "No" and meaning it. </p>
<p>It's tough when it feels like your entire world will turn it's back on you - but there's alot more world out there.</p>

        <p>I feel the same. I even warned only a few friends and most did not listen. I have already lost friends who knew about my anonymous blog, where I do post against Covid social engineering and question the vaccines. With people IRL, and I regret opening my mouth to 2-3, I am not talking. There's no getting close. I have to hide my opinions too in everyday life. I don't feel as close to people. I lost friends over religion and politics. Now I am just tired.</p>
