<p>yep, another full on lockdown in England, similar to the one we had in March. I'm gonna try my hardest to break the rules, I'm sick of being lonely. I want to see my mates. I'm so so so cik of this, why is nobody objecting to this balant breach of human rights and freedom. My parents still want me to go to uni in 2 years time, but there's no way I'm paying for a fucking online course, I'm either getting the real experience or working at Tesco's, don't care anymore. I've had Covid myself, and it wasn't pleasant but it absolutely does NOT warrant the whole country being paralysed again. I pray for small businesses, this is all about the destruction of the wroking class, which my family is a part of.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm fuming. I'm feeling a growing sense of despair, my mental health is declining. March was a horrible time for me, I can't bear to go through this again. They say schools will not open again til at least Feb half-term, until then, it's gonna be remote learning. Fuck sitting on my laptop from 8:30-2:45 every day. I can leave my house easily if I wanted to meet someone, but my friends' parents are total doomers and they can't even get out of the house. I'm 17, I should be living my life and having fun, not this. Fuck. This.</p>
<p>It's a never ending game of dangling a carrot of normal life on a stick, creating false hope for us peasants, only to plunge us back into dystopian nightmare. This will never end, and it's going to get worse. People need to protest, we need to riot. I would be more than willing to, but there's only so much a 17 year old girl can do on her own. I've found more and more of my friends agree with me, and see this lunacy. But quiet complaining won't do fuck all.</p></p>

        <p>They will use the excuse that "it's for your safety and others'". No it isn't, if it was they would only tell older people to stay home while the younger working class worked and kept the economy flowing. This virus isn't as bad as they say. In 2020 the United States had less deaths overall than the year before. Like I've said before, 2020 was just the beginning, 2021 will be worse and we will never go back to the way it was a year ago.</p>

        <p>I agree, many countries are becoming more authoritarian. They can only push us so far until we push back. We need to push back sooner or later or it will be too late and we will look back on 2020 and 2021 as the years that we could have done something but chose to comply instead.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it makes no sense when people act like 2021 will be the year of recovery, and sunshine and rainbows. They are just filling their heads with comforting lies. In reality, we have things like, severe inflation, small businesses being destroyed by the lockdowns, mental health problems and suicide from the lockdowns, and many other problems that will make 2021 a terrible year. Not to mention the governments trying to take away the basic rights of the people. This is all planned and we may not be able to do anything about it. But I would rather die fighting for my rights than live in an authoritarian dystopia controlled by the government.</p>

        <p>To be fair, most of the work from home types that havent been financially impacted by this (are likely financially better off from this with no commute, additional stimulus money, nothing to spend money on, and possibly a pay raise) are likely going to lament their favorite restaurant closing, and then go on a mega vacation and it will feel like a distant memory to them.</p>

        <p>Yeah i mean i was mostly taking a dig at those people, as they are probably the ones who think it will be sunshine and rainbows when this is over.</p>
<p>I am one of those people, but i dont pretend like a lot of people didnt just get really fucked for a year and that wont have massive repurcussions for years to come.</p>
<p>I feel like the biggest issue that will really set things off is the eviction moratorium. We are just kicking the can down the road before literally millions of americans are made homeless all at once unless we come up with a solution that isnt postpone that event for 3 more months. Its also fucking over lots of landlords who now cant pay their mortage and will lose their house, unsurprisingly the only ones who are fine are the banks.</p>

        <p>As long as uni is still conducted mainly through remote learning, PLEASE DO NOT APPLY AND DO A DEGREE. It wasn't worth the money when you still had in-person lectures, it sure as fuck isn't worth the money when you're stuck at home doing online learning with shitty streaming and floundering professors who often can't even work the slides properly during in-person lectures. </p>
<p>Go and apply for an apprenticeship, do anything that has to do with learning a craft or working with your hands. They'll be far more worth it than some inflated piece of paper in a decade's time. I was an overseas graduate who did university in the UK. There's a part of me now that genuinely regrets it from an objective educational point of view.</p>

Not really sure what to do with myself to be honest, I have a feeling I'll drop at the end of this year and just find a simple job. I won't be having a family to suppoer anyway, I wanted to be a medical proffessional, or doing something to do with science- there's a nuclear plant near me that needs workers and people with a scientific background but this Covid shit ruined all my motivations and plans for the future.

        <p>I fully sympathise with you. I can't say empathise because I'm not in the same boat as you are. </p>
<p>Yes, a lot of apprenticeship trades can be hard to pick up and physically demanding. But that's the reality of them. That's what will make them such in-demand trades both in the present and the future because most of the general population won't do them (because as you said, it's hard). But they're fundamentally necessary for societal cohesion and survival. And that's the most important factor to think of now for any undergraduate regarding their future: whether the industry they're getting into is SUSTAINABLE. Forget going into white-collar office work or trades and earning fast big bucks, because those very jobs are also the same ones that will be most impacted by remote offshoring of work (made even more possible now with the proving of work-at-home as a concept) as well as AI advancements automating everything. </p>
<p>I can empathise a little with what you said about COVID ruining all motivations and plans for the future. With the world as it is now there's no point in planning five years ahead, or even a year ahead when things can change or turn bad on a dime. It's not your fault, you're not losing your drive, because when you're in a storm your main priority is to ride it out no matter which direction you come out facing. Your most important priority is to survive, and get by, and hopefully in a few years pick up the pieces however you might. </p>
<p>The bitter reality is your generation, even more than mine, is going to have to accept that you're going to pay for the sins of all your ancestors and have worse lives than your parents or grandparents. The sooner you recognise this and make your peace with it, the better.</p>

        <p>I'd echo this, trades will be one of the job types that are needed during lockdown. Building, plastering, locksmith, sparky, plumbing, (one of the last two preferably)... it'll set you up much better than uni these days, and the work will always be needed.   </p>
<p>It sucks eh - but you're on the right money, uni isn't worth paying for remote.</p>

        <p>On the bright side, no more EU bogeyman for the chancers in Westminster to hide behind now. They'll get to own every single shit they come up with in power. And they will be thrown onto pikes the very next election that comes by. And by that I don't just mean the Tories. The entire British/English political establishment needs a gutting all across the spectrum for some meaningful change to happen. And probably the Queen has to kick the bucket too if you wish to institute any meaningful reform of the monarchy and noblesse in the UK.</p>

        <p>first thing that comes to mind for me is the more hostile attitudes towards immigrants and a higher sense of nationalism, and it already is hard for me being originally Polish despite pretty much growing up here. Lots of xenophobia, and it's only gonna get worse.</p>

        <p>People are just so afraid to step outside of the orders they're given, they're apathetic to what's going on, or support it as to feel morally superior. There's a real social pressure to comply- and I've been happy to see some people around me look at the evidence objectively, and seeing this for what it really is, one by one. The adult babies are in the majority however, and won't be changig their ways easily, as the post covid life suits their hermit needs &amp; they want everyone to be as miserable as them.</p>
