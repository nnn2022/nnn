        <p>I’d like to see longer studies. What happens to these children in 5 years? Who is paying their medical bills? Are they allowed to attend college if vaccines are required but they don’t want the 2nd dose?</p>

        <p>Well in the immediate. </p>
<p>Myocarditis often leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the major long-term sequela of the disease and can subsequently cause congestive heart failure. Myocarditis/DCM is the cause of nearly half of all heart transplants in the United States and is responsible for 5–20% of all cases of sudden death in young adults.</p>
<p>We know that in viral myocarditis, the disease can progress from an acute stage to a chronic stage with impaired cardiac function (Ventricular Fibrillation and Ventricular Tachycardia)... leading to DCM. Although most patients with the acute form of myocarditis resolve, about one-third progress to DCM.</p>
<p>Men with myocarditis and DCM develop more severe cardiac dysfunction and have a worse outcome than women.</p>

<p>How can they justify injecting children with this, with results like this? And bear in mind we are still very early in the vaccination of children. The chance of death for these age ranges is basically 0. The whole point of the vaccine is to reduce your chances of death to almost 0. So again, why inject them with this? <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1407378069275426819">Young teenage boys are already dying</a>.</p>

        <p>There (could) be a simpler less sinister explanation. Based of previous negative press about other vaccines, there was a significant drop in uptake. Like that 60 minute piece about autism? Well the public trust in vaccines is very fragile actually, and it’s very easy to start questioning them when you find out the ingredient lists, or the side effects, or when you actually see the data for effectiveness… So the best strategy is to belittle and ridicule any person who questions any part of the vaccine process or outcome. Because the public’s opinion can change very fast because of fear. So fear the virus not the vaccines, and sensor anything to the contrary. Why? Because of some BS formula that dictates that one person vaccinated = x amount of saved lives. But in reality, such a formula is impossible to come up with given the complexity of the situation. 
I mean we could assume that these Pharma companies who were on the edge of bankruptcy in 2018/19 got lucky, but that’s besides the point. Whether this was created to benefit anyone or deliberately unleashed is besides the point when you consider the gobs and gobs of money made by certain entities as a result… I just think that simple old greed is a more likely scenario than depopulation and whether these events are planned or coincidental doesn’t matter in a way.</p>

        <p>It started in Nov 2019 when I heard about a weird disease in china.  I told my wife in 2019, there's something weird going on in China, this is going to be global in 2 months and will fuck the world economy...(Economy crash is pending in the next 6 months). From there It started when the Covid rules started being contradictory and creating mass confusion.  From there, I paid attention to the small minute details around "emergency use" granted for the vaccine which is a loophole to skip clinical trials. </p>
<p>started hearing talk about Ivermectin. And now with the recent podcasts coming out (Darkhorse - Bret Weinstein) and now the emergency JRE podcast with Bret, there's too many unanswered questions. </p>
<p>The counter argument is "vaccine yourself so that you save other people" is insidious in nature. It's mass propaganda through virtue signalling. </p>
<p>It's so bad that my own parents have said casually in conversation</p>
<p>"we are second guessing seeing you because you're not vaccinated". </p>
<p>"We won't feel bad for you if you get sick"</p>
<p>"We're getting vaccinated for you, you're being selfish for not doing it". </p>
<p>The mass confusion and propaganda is insane, and it's at that point that I knew that someone pissed in the punch bowl.</p>

        <p>I understand that there are a lot of inconsistencies and lies and it's quite obvious at this point but what exactly was the breaking point 2 weeks ago, if the narrative started crumbling way earlier? I'm just curious what makes people join our side. A lot of people are fed up with the restrictions but they refuse to look beyond that and try to understand why this is happening. So I'm curious to know what was the last straw for you.</p>

        <p>The last straw I think was when my age group was eligible for vaccination BC Canada, I held off waiting for additional information to come out in regards to the vaccine. From there I received tremendous pressure and inquiry into why am I not getting it, have you got it yet blah blah.  Two weeks ago I went for a walk with my family and in the same breath my mom goes</p>
<p>"We can't wait to travel again, it's so exciting." We're all getting the shot for you, you're being selfish by not thinking of others and getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>At that point I called them out and said "EVERYONE getting the shot is doing it for self-serving survival purposes, that's literally in our DNA. By adding virtue signalling ontop of it, you're playing into the segregation of society if you don't agree with freedom of choice". </p>
<p>From there, I recognized this "oversharing" we've all been accustomed to with social media and this entitlement people have to your information. Which led me to look more into the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I’m not the person you’re asking, but I can answer your question about what makes someone change… I was following some people in early 2020 regarding lab leak… and it looked very convincing, but no one I knew in real life would listen to anything I had found. Like ears plugged lalalala. And  it was a very lonely place, so I dropped it. Came back a year later and now it’s not just a crazy theory, it’s gotten a lot of traction and supporting evidence from the same people I was following back in early 2020. But at that point, it just took someone close to me to tell me that I’m being irrational to even consider lab theory. And with the emergence of the vaccines, I’ve looked up the companies and their track records, and it looks really bad. Then I just have this persistent memory of going to doctors all my life, and then at some point seeing their offices get more and more cluttered with pharma crap, notepads, pens, clocks, posters, free shit they started giving away with brands on it. This was like late 1990? And this always stayed with me, like as an example, how fast this change took place and no one even noticed how the doctors were given all this merch and dinners and vacations to persuade their patients to get on these various prescriptions instead of trying to find the root cause of the problem. And now the focus has been on reminding us that our health is completely out of our control, that only this vaccine can save us… And then this image of a doctors office with all this branded crap, so it’s just too depressing to think that there is really so much greed and corruption, sometimes it’s easier to just not question anything, and most people don’t because it’s gotten well beyond anyone’s control, but it’s not hard to join “this side” it’s just that people would rather not because it’s not fun on this side, it’s depressing as hell.</p>

        <p>It also is important to note that everything reported to VAERS is NOT 100% verified. VAERS only records incidents after a vaccination; not a result of vaccination. There is a distinction.</p>

        <p>Yes but also no.</p>
<p>The point of VAERS and Covid data that look for negative events after a a specific event (positive test or vaccine) is to identify population-level correlations. </p>
<p>This method of statistics is actually quite sound, as you’re never going to be able to reliably demonstrate causality for each particular case without introducing the biases of the person tasked with making that determination.</p>
<p>This type of statistics is how we do most science, believe it or not.</p>

        <p>Also needs to be considered those with severe covid outcomes almost always have severe existing conditions. This doesn't seem to be true for vaccine induced heart inflammation.</p>
<p>For a healthy young male you certainly are increasing your risk through taking these shots.</p>
<p>Also we would have to assume that the rates of heart inflammation will increase with booster shots if it's more prevalent after the 2nd dose.  Opting into the continual injection program doesn't have good odds.</p>

        <p>This is certainly concerning and most likely caused by the spike protein but I'm surprised no one in this sub cares to look at data from an actual covid infection. The rates of myocarditis after covid are at around 60% regardless of severity, there was a study done with student athletes that showed ~15% developed myocarditis despite almost all of them being asymptomatic. Covid is an artificially enhanced coronavirus that replicates through your body overwhelming it with spike protein vs the vaccine which creates a finite amount of spike protein (still damaging but not to the same extent as covid).</p>

<p>It is my possibly incorrect understanding that myocarditis/pericarditis caused from viral infection is quite common especially in young people.  And many don't realize they have it.  In other words, how is myocarditis/pericarditis caused by COVID any different than from some other cause?</p>

        <p>I seem to be confused about how this information is interpreted.</p>
<p>It seems, in total, there are 399 cases above estimate. Even if we double that for assumption of underreporting, that's still 798 cases.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If we compare this to the number of doses administered in the United States: 315,525,205, I get that there's a 0.00000253% chance of this adverse reaction to the vaccine. To me, this minuscule chance of getting this very specific heart disease from the vaccine seems more worthwhile than the death rate of Covid.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Is there a step in here I'm missing that should suggest I don't get the vaccine?</p>

        <p>I would bet a lot of money that if we properly counted Covid deaths in young adults (as in, we don't just assume everyone who died presumably with Covid because they had a PCR test amplified to 45 cycles turn up positive died FROM Covid), we would find that the actual death rate is lower than 0.00000253%.   </p>
<p>But really, the choice of getting the vaccine is yours and yours alone to make. Your body, your choice, please just be gracious enough to extend the same courtesy to people who won't take the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your believing this is being over reported. Sadly, I don't think either of us can ever prove that. Therefore it's mostly just conjecture. If we look at death tolls year over year (here's a fun one here: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm</a>) it definitely does seem to be an abnormally high jump in deaths.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I appreciate your disdain for a "lack of choice" when it comes to getting a vaccine. I truly do. I think that medical should be a protected class, just like race or sexual orientation. If a business isn't allowed to kick out someone for being gay, they shouldn't be able to kick someone out for having a broken leg, or not having a vaccine. Sadly, in a lot of the places that it is mandatory (international travel, schools), the precedence is set.</p>

        <p>I haven't found a source for your 10M doses figure, but I'm gonna run with it anyways.<br>
My previous double statistic for this would bring this down to 0.0008% chance of having this as an issue.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Taking statistics from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#SexAndAge">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#SexAndAge</a> , we get 2704 deaths and 137871 cases for those under 30. Indicating 0.0196% mortality rate within this same age group.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I wouldn't disagree that 0.02% is a fairly negligible percentage, and think it would be fairly safe to consider "no risk." But that means that this pericarditis/myocarditis issue is even more "no risk" than covid. This doesn't even begin to consider the fact that one of them is communicable between people, potentially spreading to those who may be "at risk".</p>

<p>When you say "orders of magnitude", where does that come from?  </p>
<p>And how is "deaths involving covid" different from "Myocarditis and Pericarditis involving vaccines"? What makes them non-comparible?</p>

<p>You can't really control if you get COVID or not.  You can follow all the guidance and still get it.  Where as, you have a choice to get the vaccine or not (at this point).</p>

        <p>I can respect that to an extent. It's honestly terrifying deciding to put something in your body that may make you feel sick. Personally, I find it easier to swallow picking a day or two to feel kind of bad, and knowing I can't get the disease, versus getting the disease and hoping it doesn't knock me down for too long.</p>

<p>Just like many people get the vaccine and don't have any side effects.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong man, I wanna be as critical of the vaccine as possible, but comparing the best possible outcome of getting covid versus the worst possible outcomes of the vaccine is a very unfair comparison. To me, that would be akin to "look at all these people who weren't wearing seat belts and walked away from the accident like nothing happened, and now these guys who wore it and died in accidents."</p>

<p>This is the part that doesn't make sense to me. You say "relatively rare" without any statistics. What is relatively rare versus the 0.0008% of under 30 individuals that obtain Pericarditis/Myocarditis after vaccinated? The death rate is 0.0196% for those in the same age group that died after getting Covid.</p>

<p>Look at the CDC.  It <em>is</em> rare for anyone under 45 or 50 even to die of COVID. </p>

<p>By your own admission the death rate of people under 30 is 0.0196%, that sounds rare to me.</p>

        <p>Not disagreeing with you there man. 0.02% is something that I would call "rare."</p>
<p>That's honestly why I posted here and am trying to understand the viewpoints that are being talked about here. I am to understand that this post is trying to make the point that young individuals not only don't need the vaccine (a decent point in a vacuum) but it is irresponsible health wise to get it (the point I'm trying to clarify).</p>
<p>We're fixating on the vaccine causing a concerning adverse reaction in 0.0008% of individuals within that group, while the death rate is 0.0196% in the virus that this vaccine is preventing. </p>
<p>I would say that pericarditis/myocarditis is "relatively rare" compared to the death rate of individuals -- which seems to be the same point that you're trying to make in reverse.</p>

        <p>Using that reasoning, they're also not at risk of pericarditis/myocarditis either. In fact, there is less of a concern of getting pericarditis/myocarditis than there is dying of covid. </p>

<p>To me, at least, this should make getting the vaccine as a Male under 30 the obvious decision, no? Not even accounting the fact that I may be a not well understood asymptomatic spreader, or even a symptomatic one.</p>

        <p>My point is that there are plenty of other things that cause it.  I would bet most of the cases are not caused by COVID over the past two years.</p>
<p>And the other reason is that there is an ethics one where if there is no significant risk of COVID to people under 30, as well as questionable asymptomatic spread, why give them something that's currently deemed as "emergency use."  In the unfortunate event that there is something wrong with the vaccine, these are the people that will have to live the longest with the repercussions.</p>

        <p>Perhaps we're misunderstanding each other? I'm making no claims, nor have any information about Covid causing Myocarditis/Pericarditis. I am strictly comparing the possibility of contracting these conditions through the vaccine versus the blanket death rate of individuals in the same category. </p>
<p>0.0196% Death from covid vs a 0.0008% of contracting Pericarditis/Myocarditis from vaccine.</p>
<p>I was attempting to avoid discussing vaccinating those who aren't at risk, but sure we can discuss that too. Just because I have an 0.0196% chance of dying after getting covid doesn't mean I'm asymptomatic. I could potentially just have very mild symptoms and pass it on to someone who is heavily at risk. I see that as a possible concern.</p>
<p>I don't think we exactly disagree in terms of EAU vaccine being mandated or required, so I'd like to spend as little on this as possible. In short, I believe that stating no individual under 30 should get a non-FDA approved vaccine is just as irresponsible as mandating it.</p>

<p>Likely.</p>
<p>There's a couple of issues here:  </p>
<p>You're tangling things together in one instance, but then throw out something that needs to be considered.  </p>
<p>First:  I don't know if it's right to compare death from disease to non death side effects from vaccine.  Seems like comparing apples to oranges.  But, in any case, it seems that death from COVID (or any major complications) is rare in children and so far the reported side effects from vaccine are more rare.</p>
<p>Second:  The EUA needs to be considered.  We have no long term data on mRNA vaccines, especially in the general population.  We also have no long term efficacy data on the COVID vaccines.  </p>
<p>Third:  People who are even mildly sick right now should stay home and get tested, even if vaccinated.  My wife has to go into work, and they have a blanket policy:  anyone who remotely looks/sounds sick goes home.  </p>
<p>The question people have on this sub is why should people at low risk in the first place need a vaccine where we don't know the long term ramifications?</p>

<p>This is the exact point I'm making. The absolute worst case scenario with the virus is still more probable than a treatable condition made by the vaccine. I would love to see what you think is a more apt or fair comparison, but this one we're currently talking about is pointing to Vaccine &rt; Covid even for young individuals.</p>
<p>&rt;We have no long term data on mRNA vaccines, especially in the general population. We also have no long term efficacy data on the COVID vaccines.</p>
<p>Nor do we have long term data on Covid itself. We, at least, have been researching mRNA for at least the passed 30 years. Despite this, we have seen adverse long term effects of covid. So I'm not sure that is an apt argument to oppose it. To not give FDA accreditation, sure, but to oppose it wholeheartedly, I fail to grasp.</p>
<p>&rt;People who are even mildly sick right now should stay home and get tested, even if vaccinated. My wife has to go into work, and they have a blanket policy: anyone who remotely looks/sounds sick goes home.</p>
<p>I wish this was true in all positions. Granted it was prior to the pandemic, but I was incredibly sick and was still told I needed to go to work in the food service industry.</p>
<p>&rt;The question people have on this sub is why should people at low risk in the first place need a vaccine where we don't know the long term ramifications?</p>
<p>To get back to the true normal? No shutting down small businesses because of a virus, no masks, so on and so forth.</p>

        <p>We are talking about children. Children have basically 0 chance of death from covid, but the data from CDC shows a huge increase in compilations of the heart for kids aged 12-16 for example. The kids should risk the virus rather than the vaccine, the data is clear.</p>

        <p>The other guy hasn't given me a response, but basically said the same thing. I ran through the math here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o6finm/cdc_finally_posted_an_update_on/h2tq6qj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o6finm/cdc_finally_posted_an_update_on/h2tq6qj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a>  </p>
<p>Tl;dr: It's a 0.0008% of Pericarditis/Myocarditis with the vaccine and a 0.0196% chance of death for individuals within that same age range with Covid. They've yet to give me a response that really explains how those statistics are wrong, so I'd really appreciate it if you could.</p>

<p>Idk man, it just seems to me like a couple shots in the arm and a infinitesimal chance of having a heart condition is a better decision than facing the virus at its convenience and having a death rate higher than that of getting the vaccine's disease.</p>

        <p>False. The average and median age of a covid death exceeds the average life expectancy. These are old age deaths and deaths of the already extremely ill being marketed as covid deaths through overuse of PCR tests.</p>

        <p>Averages are a poor metric, though. Averages are weighed down by early deaths. If 9 people die at 80 and one dies at 10, the average age of death is substantially lower than the mode age of death.</p>
