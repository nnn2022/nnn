    <strong>A Critical Look at U.K. Hospitalization Rates</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/uksciencechief/status/1417204235356213252">So the U.K.’s chief scientific advisor has corrected his earlier comments to say that 60% of new Covid hospitalizations are unvaccinated individuals.</a></p>
<p>U.K. estimates show only 31.5% as unvaccinated this seems to suggest a slight protective benefit although 31.5% vs 40% seems close enough that other confounding factors between the two populations could nullify the difference.</p>
<p>What I really want to point out though, is the difference between what “breakthrough cases” should be based on vaccine estimates vs actuals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7020e2.htm">Based of of this I would like to reference CDC data which states that A single shot is 82% effective while two shots are 92% effective.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations">According to the latest numbers, 68.5% of the U.K. has two jabs while another 19.4% has a single jab which gives us a total vaccinated population of 84.9%.</a> Immediately it is worth wondering why the 15.1% of the population is contributing to 60% of the newly reported Covid cases but the predicted number here <em>should</em> be closer to 92.85%... Obviously, a much higher percentage of the vaccinated population is being hospitalized than should be expected.</p>
<p>I base the above on the expectations that the  68.5% with both vaccines to account for 3.23% of cases (68.5<em>0.05); while the other 19.4% with a single shot would account for 3.92% (19.4</em>0.18). Together the anticipated breakthrough cases should be 7.15%.</p>
<p>Now perhaps we can explain this away by pointing out differences in strains between the US and U.K.. after all maybe the CDC numbers do not apply. But according to the British government, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-hospitalisation-from-delta-variant">two shots are 92-96% effective and a single shot is about 17% less effective when compared to alpha strain. </a></p>
<p>That gives us (68.5% * 0.06) or 4.11% &amp; (19.4 * 0.35) 6.79 which together would be 10.9%... again 4 times lower than actual hospitalizations. With vaccinated rates being so much higher I feel there is a good case to be made that there are complicating factors which are not being accounted for in terms of hospitalization rates. </p>
<p>Ultimately, there are two possibilities that I see:
1. The vaccine is closer to 23% effectiveness in which case the risk-reward ratio shifts dramatically.
2. There are confounding variables which are being ignored. This invalidates any direct comparison of the vaccinated vs unvaccinated population unless adjusted to consider these variables.</p>
<p>TLDR:
Statistics don’t lie but statisticians do. Simple comparisons rarely tell the full story. The U.K. govt/media are twisting the numbers to give a false impression of significance of the vaccine.</p></p>

<p>“Over 99 percent of covid-19 deaths in June were among the unvaccinated. Yet even as evidence grows that vaccines are safe and effective, resistance to them is also growing.”</p>
<p>Wait a second. If they aren’t tracking breakthrough infections, how are they able to tell if these people are dying with covid or not? Shouldn’t logic assume that they aren’t testing these vaccinated people that are dying, whose average age just so happens to be higher than the average life expectancy in the US? </p>
<p>This whole situation is so fucked. Our media sponsored State is so fucked.</p>

        <p>I’d love to see the numbers they are using to get that talking point. Guarantee there is some mathematical sorcery involved.</p>

        <p>Yeah, good news is, you’ll never see those numbers. They’re from AP referencing something that’s referencing something buried who knows.</p>

        <p>Yeah, they reference a tweet which is linked to a CNN article which quotes a lady at the CDC.</p>
<p>If you search nearly every state has an article making similar claims but nobody is mentioning the data. CDC has some deaths data which conveniently doesn’t touch May or June so it’s impossible to look at it and see how it’s being manipulated.</p>
