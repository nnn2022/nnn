    <strong>Which Hogwarts house are you in? (Anti-lockdown edition)</strong>
    <p><p>This is probably really silly, but it can be nice to have something more light-hearted.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre a Harry Potter fan and are anti-lockdown, anti-mask etc, what is your Hogwarts house? 
I‚Äôm curious which house attracts the most independent thinkers who are capable of going against the herd mentality of ‚Äújust obey the government.‚Äù</p>
<p>In percentages,
I‚Äôm highly Slytherin, followed closely by Ravenclaw. 
Moderate amount of Gryffindor and almost zero Hufflepuff on any quiz I take.</p>
<p>I feel like Slytherin and Ravenclaw would be the most capable of seeing thru bullshit and not giving two shits about rules lol.</p>
<p>Wish I could take a house poll of the Doomers as welll. Just to see if there‚Äôs any difference. Maybe they‚Äôre all insane, conformist Hufflepuffs? The evil side of the badger appears.</p></p>

        <p>I'm a Hufflepuff :) Although it has always been considered the most fluffy bunny of the houses (and I can see why, lol) I still think the warm and welcoming Hufflepuff spirit can be used to resist the new normal. I still invite people to meet in person (haven't had much luck, but I keep trying), walk outside looking for lonely strangers to talk to, support small business, especially those who show some resistance, and write positive reviews for them. Let's all defeat our real-life Lord Voldemort together!</p>

        <p>My husband and I are both Ravenclaws and heavily against this insane tyranny. As a hairstylist who loves HP I can say that all my ravenclaw clients are antimask and antilockdown. There are some like that from other houses as well but the majority I know are Raveclaws, even some Hufflepuffs. Most Slytherins and Gryffindors that I know personally are doomers, which I think has to do with their personal political leanings and nonstop consumption of social media. One of the things I love about Ravenclaw house is the pursuit of knowledge and the open-mindedness of intellect. All houses have strong points and I have friends in every house, but I do wish there were more Ravenclaws in politics, that would help immensely.</p>

        <p>Slytherin! :) </p>
<p>I wonder if there is any pattern at all to our anti lockdown, anti New World Order, etc mindset, and Hogwarts house. I can see Gryffindor because I'd think brave people would notice when their rights and freedom are being toyed with and it would anger them. I can see Ravenclaw because of intelligence, open mind, and originality. These are the best three things for seeing what's going on. I can see Slytherin because of cleverness and power. I think of us as being realists, having common sense, and a strong identity, and that we don't want to be controlled or yanked around, so we catch on to corruption. I think of Hufflepuffs as the most likely house to believe propaganda, the media, the government. Sorry. </p>
<p>But, there might not be any pattern at all. My closest family members are all aware of this stuff too, and two are Gryffindor, my Poppy was a third Gryffindor but he passed away, two are Hufflepuff, another is Ravenclaw. Poppy is the only reason my Granny (Hufflepuff) ever caught on. My Dad (Gryffindor) is the only reason my Stepmom (Hufflepuff) knows.</p>
<p>I've always been curious and suspicious, and I credit Green Day for "waking me up" to things. American Idiot came out when I was 8, and I loved the hits I always heard. I liked the lyrics too, and I remember asking Dad what American Idiot and Holiday were about. (By the way, I'm still obsessed with the band and I'm a fangirl of Billie Joe.)</p>
<p>Here are a few past and current friends, their house, and their stance.</p>
<p>Gryffindor- thought like we do. </p>
<p>Hufflepuff one- believed everything the media said.</p>
<p>Hufflepuff two- same as above. </p>
<p>Hufflepuff three- Foggy? I don't know how to put it. She knows some things are messed up but at the same time tends to believe the media, so she's in the middle I guess. </p>
<p>Hufflepuff four- knows the government is a mess and hates masks and lockdowns. She does buy into other things they push though, so not fully awake. </p>
<p>Hufflepuff five- Same as above. I also want to say her and four are not HP fans, and I see them as Gryffindors, but when I showed them information on the houses and asked them to choose what they identified with most, they both picked Hufflepuff. </p>
<p>Ravenclaw- Her and I are very similar. She tends to think like we do. </p>
<p>Ravenclaw two- Kind of in the middle. Example: knows how the government is and believes a lot of things that others call conspiracies, but also thinks Conservatives are all racists, guns are evil, cops hunt black people, etc.</p>

        <p>Slytherins worship the freedom to do whatever they want. They don't like rules. They don't like anything to be off-limits. They have a historical problem that JKR wrote into them, but that is separate from the actual traits of their house. Many fans speculate that a lot of those DE kids only get sorted into Slytherin because they ask the hat to put them there, not because they are true Slytherins and embody "ambition, cleverness, etc." Do Crabbe and Goyle seem clever to you?</p>
<p>Ravenclaws worship academic freedom, so they're very, very similar to Slytherins. No knowledge should be off-limits. Everything is worth studying. Everything should be questioned.</p>
<p>Gryffindors worship acts of courage and attention-seeking. They can be brave and bold, but also foolhardy and stupid, and attention-seeking just for the sake of "showing off". I wouldn't be surprised if "showing off" could sometimes take the form of "virtue signaling". a la <em>"I'm a Gryffindor. Look how holy and righteous I am!"</em></p>
<p>Hufflepuffs worship conformity. The group is more important than the individual. Getting along and being kind is more important than truth, ambition, or courage. This makes Hufflepuffs the easiest, kindest people to get along with in normal circumstances, but it also makes them the least likely to stand up in defiance in an uncomfortable situation, aka going against the group.</p>
<p>The only way I could see a Slytherin going along with lockdowns and masks is if it is a person at the very top: aka politicians who simply enjoy having power over others.  The rest of the Slytherins would be PISSED OFF that you're forcing more rules on them, especially for idiotic reasons.</p>
<p>Ravenclaws would be PISSED OFF if they see thru the garbage, but I 'm sure some of them could easily convince themselves that they are "highly educated" and following "highly educated" experts and so there's no need to question any of it. But I think most Ravenclaws would question it like crazy, as long as they didn't get too high on their own arrogance of being "highly educated".</p>
