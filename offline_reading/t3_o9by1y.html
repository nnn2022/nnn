    <strong>The Government, WHO or Fauci Don't Give A F About You. They Keep Proving This Again and Again. What Don't You Understand Doomers?</strong>
    <p><p>"But No! We have progressed and made vaccines in less than a year." Which... Don't work long term.  You doomers forgot to read the fine print. Most people who are getting covid now are fully fucking vaccinated with these experimental jabs, yet, somehow they're still getting covid. And oh, did I forget these are the same people who are still quad masking while being fully vaccinated. Like what a grand logic üëèüëè. You people don't want freedom on purpose. Who in the right mind, wants to inject themselves with some rushed bs only to still wear masks and want these draconian lockdowns to never end? It doesn't make any sense. I'm convinced now that these lockdowns and masks are like drugs for you guys which keep you high.</p>
<p>You dumb fucks forgot something. In order to get your temporary freedoms back, you have happily injected yourself with this "vaccine" which you yourselves don't know the long-term side affects of. The truth is you anti-social fucks love being locked up in your basements and had no lives prior to covid and you now enjoy getting off from these needles and wearing them masks. And <strong>mainly</strong> from dictating Us to wear it. That's what get's you ultimately off.</p>
<p>Recently, I was at a gas station and just paying for gas. And of course, without a mask. I live in Canada and masks are still mandatory here, but if you claim exemption you can get away. So, as I'm in the line a doomer literally comes upto Me and says, "You forgot your mask" I'm like "I'm exempted." And he's like to the cashier, "Don't serve him. No mask, no service." Literally. I straight up told him, "Shove your mask up your fucking ass. Who the fuck are you to tell Me what to do and not to do? You love getting off by telling Me that huh? Instead, you not only wear 1 mask, but wear the whole mask box and super glue the box permanently on your face so you can permanently stfu, because you have nothing beneficial to say anyway." Guess what? He then called Me a "grandma killer" and was murmuring some nonsense and then walked away.  I'm just fucking tired of these clowns that keep dictating Us. That's their only way to get "happy" because they have no other way. I'm pro choice. I don't give a fuck who does what with their lives. Just don't tell Me what to do. I do only what I fucking want. </p>
<p>You doomers thought it'll be only 2 jabs and you'll get your freedoms back huh? Well, with these never ending fucking variants, they're now in talks for another upcoming lockdown. Like Wtf? I bet there is going to be another vaccine for this delta whatever bs variant now aswell. You fucks keep on getting fooled time and time again but still don't get it. The truth is right in front of you but you're deaf, dumb and blind to see it. Fauci, WHO or whoever the fuck, they all don't give 2 fucks about you. You all are just merely lab rats for them which they're testing all this Orwellian nonsense on and you all keep on complying. Fuck that.</p></p>
