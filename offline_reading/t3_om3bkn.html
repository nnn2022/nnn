    <strong>The gradual decline of self sufficient resources and skills. Coincidence or orchestration?</strong>
    <p><p>When you look or talk to the older generation (past encounters or  currently living today) many grew up in a time that didn't rely on  supermarkets or mass manufacturing of products and services to survive.  Without those things, people were more self sufficient. This could be  seen as a 'threat' to globalists. Has anyone noticed this and do you  think it was due to a multitude of factors (by random) or a cunning plan  to control?</p></p>

        <p>Well, not the cash crop "farmers", but small farms trying to sell directly to market especially organically - yes, they hate them!</p>
<p>Just look at something like the sale of raw milk in the US or the hoops you have to jump through to butcher and sell and animal on your own farm.  This has been decades in the making.  They want you as <em>reliant</em> as possible.</p>

        <p>How can you prevent the accumulation of wealth in a free society? Does that not imply some form of government control. </p>
<p>I dont think that is correct. If elon musk wants to build rockets, he should be allowed to. The solution is smaller government.</p>

        <p>Should he be allowed to make choices that affect everyone else without being elected to do so? You cannot prevent the accumulation, which is why perfection will never come. However, we can have direct democracy today. Everyone can engage on any issue on a grass roots level. When a global decision must be made, it must never be a single person or a small group who decides.</p>

        <p>Annnnd, we have a winner, John nailed it.</p>
<p>A few years ago, just for grins and giggles, I asked my coworkers (~30 or so), "What are the first ten amendments of the Constitution called"? Wanna guess how many correct answers I got? Seven and a half, I gave one girl half credit for her answer "Something about rights."</p>
<p>I also asked which is larger a fifth or a quart, that split fairly even for correct answers, How many quarts are in a gallon? One girl answered 12. There were a few other similar questions, those were the standouts. Oh, I forgot, Where does butter come from? Most common answer - I don't know</p>
<p>This is a pool of High School graduates, High School or GED required for employment. Scary part is the college educated office folks didn't do much better.</p>

        <p>If we use our current system, it really depends on how that wealth is made. So many huge corporations have destroyed small local businesses, dodged taxes and kept things offshore. They find loop holes in the system and they also make deals with their buddies who make their way into positions of power. </p>
<p>We need more transparency in governments and businesses. Also, I feel like the masses are ignorant to the fact that there are a small amount of people in this world that lack a great deal of empathy. These people exploit those masses.</p>
<p>Having said that though, there are a lot of businesses and people in positions of power that do give a shit and do their best to make the world a better place.</p>

        <p>Globalists want to service problems, not solve them. We could be directing our technology towards being less dependent on the system, but globalists will do everything they can to prevent that.</p>
<p>They build planned obsolescence into everything. People should not be reverting to old forms of self-sufficiency, but developing self-sufficiency as part of technological development. But, if there is no planned obsolescence, how can we have technological development? If things don't break, why would we buy new ones?</p>
<p>Edison first sold light, not lightbulbs. They have found it cheaper to make us liable and more profitable, since they can sell a whole slew of products that are needed to get the end product: light.</p>
<p>Don't let them confuse you into thinking the developments were the globalists. The developments were ours, bought and controlled by the globalists, but there is no reason we should not use them, just need to find a better way to do so.</p>

        <p>In the end, it doesn't matter the cause. Coincidence or orchestrated, the globalists will take advantage of what has become a clear weakness.</p>
<p>It could just be human nature to be lazy. Distribution of labor did usher in a era of technological advances. Seemingly causing our own demise. We shackled ourselves.</p>

        <p>Planned, but nobody noticed bc people enjoyed the convenience. Even most farmers are no longer self sufficient. I'm in Ireland &amp; if there was a real national emergency now that lasted more than one week, the country would collapse. A businessman I know told me around the time of Brexit, that Ireland was almost totally dependent on flour imported through the UK as Ireland has only <strong>5 days</strong> worth of flour at any given time (excluding retail sales). 
This leaves people nowhere to go, but on their knees to government.</p>

        <p>I definitely don't think it's a coincidence. My theory is that it's about tax money and control. My grandparents were born in the 1910s and had a mostly self sufficient farm all the way up to the early 2000s with cows, goats, pigs, and chickens, plus acres and acres of vegetables. They were both healthy up to their 90s, and they saved every penny because they were convinced there would be a new Depression one day. The only things they ever bought at a store were flour, sugar, coffee, that they couldn't grow themselves.</p>
<p>If everyone was like that, the government would lose massive amounts of money, because they'd lose the tax they make off all your grocery purchases. If the average modern family spends 200+ on groceries every week, multiplied by millions of families, imagine how much tax that adds up to every year. </p>
<p>Plus they know you're dependent on the system - you have to be a cog in the corporate machine to keep affording food, or you starve.</p>
<p>For the last couple years since I started thinking about this, I've tried to be more self sufficient. We started growing our own vegetables and got a flock of chickens. We're lucky to have the space, but unfortunately not everyone does</p>

        <p>100%. That right there is a great example of healthy living. Very different to what the medical model proposes. I guess for people that don't have the space, community gardens can be good.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 60s in Australia, a lot of Southern Europeans migrated here after the war. They brought with them their lifestyle and knowledge from back home, growing their own food, fixing things that were broken, community networking etc. Very few aussies did this as generally they were more concerned with their lawn and the like (similar to the 'American Dream').</p>
<p>I have seen the decline of this type of living as 2 generations of migrant offspring have grown up. They have simply lost these skills, likely due to a lack of interest, westernization, globalisation, technology, and an increase in wealth - compared to their parents/grandparents.</p>
