    <strong>Should I take the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>So, basically, I live in Brazil, and they are giving the "coronavac" vaccine here, Idk whether it differs a lot from the Pfizer vaccine or not. But anyways, my mother wants me to take this vaccine desperately, even though we can't fight in law if anything happens to either me or her. She has already taken the vaccine and seems alright, should I take it as well or is it too risky? I'd REALLY like to take it just to comfort her, but I'm really afraid of the side-effects.</p></p>

        <p>It's obviously you're choice my man.</p>
<p>I might respectfully suggest, that taking it to make her happy/comfortable might not be the best motivation to follow.</p>
<p>I'll post below some counter information to read up on if your interested.</p>
<p>Personally speaking, I have a fairly strong urge to beg and plead with people not to take it. That's my position for what it is worth.</p>

        <p>Thats the sinovac vaccine. Its an inactivated virus vaccine that is likely safer than the pfizer one. That being said its still new and the long term safety testing is still ongoing so i would probably want to wait until more data has been released.</p>

        <p>Short term side effects will most likely be minimal. It's the long term side effects that are a total unknown. You need to look up if it works by manipulating your cells to make the protein for your immune system to fight, in which case I would stay away from, or does it work like normal vaccines just giving you a weakened version of the virus for your immune system to fight, in that case I would take it. Unfortunately I dont think any true vaccines have been made yet, at least all the ones here in America are the first type and actually fall under the definition of gene therapy rather than vaccine.</p>

        <p>It's not just a month or two, personally I'm going to wait ten years at least. I have heard some scientists express concern that these drugs could hurt your chances of getting pregnant for example, a side effect like that will only be noticeable many years after it's been out. Most drugs are tested for years before they hit the market but this was rushed out in just a couple months. If it worked like normal vaccines than I would be fine with it since it would be just a small tweak to what has already been out for many many years.</p>

        <p>You know, if you're consider taking it, you might want to first invest in serological test for t cells. Chances are you're immune already. Also, the way I see it, taking drugs to make someone else happy isn't the wisest think you can do. Take it if YOU want to take it.</p>

        <p>Good point, regular blood work is covered by my insurance but I didn’t know if it was a super hard test to get as in you’d have to be in a research study or something. Not in the medical field so my knowledge is a bit lacking. When antibody testing first became available in my area it was like $200. But thank you, I’ll look into it!</p>

        <p>That’s awesome to know. I’m in the US but I don’t doubt it can be done here too. I’m assuming it’s just like a normal blood test? They don’t need to do an anal swab or anything? 😆</p>

<p>42 bucks with change, apparently. And yeah, it was positive in my case. 6 months earlier they shoved a stick in my nose and that one was positive too btw. Never had any symthoms</p>

        <p>Most people don't understand how a vaccine works (or not) in the body, including most doctors. It's being pushed entirely for political and profit reasons. </p>
<p>The question you should be asking yourself is: "do I trust the motivations of those pushing an untested preventative product on the entire population with the goal of maybe reducing the worst effects of what is essentially a bad cold?"</p>

        <p>Your mom took the jab within the last 3 months. There's no way of knowing the medium- and long-term results of something that has not even completed Phase 3 trials. </p>
<p>Every single attempt at making coronavirus vaccines has resulted in a DEADLY phenomenon known as antibody dependency enhancement in which animal test subjects (remember, NO C19 jab had animal trials) became extremely sick and died when exposed to the live and/or similar coronaviruses. </p>
<p>TLDR: don't get the jab.</p>

        <p>Just leave the house and come back and tell her you took it. The long term effects  and the legal impunity are definitely something to be concerned with, but it's unlikely the majority of people are going to immediately drop dead within days of taking it.</p>

        <p>Sadly they have commercials of people who seem very happy to be injected with unknown chemicals or at least they pretend to be happy. Why would anyone do such a thing is beyond me, but I guess if people believe everything they see on tv or that their govt tells them then they will believe in the lie. To believe in and propagate a lie is to be part of the problem not the solution.</p>

        <p>I would say "No!"</p>
<p>These are not vaccines. These are gene therapies and you need to get educated on the history of pathogenic priming, wholesale deaths of every single lab animal given these gene therapies, etc.</p>
<p>They just are not safe in the real world. They have been linked to hemorrhagic symptoms as late as 2018 (yes, I'm talking "You bleed out like with Ebola!") and I can find no documentation that they fixed those issues.</p>

        <p>I personally don't trust it and worry about ADE from a coronavirus vaccine. Studies show that it's not common and mild when it does show up. The reason they gave up on SARS vaccines was because of ADE in the animal trials. Past vaccines in human trials for RSV made infants more sick and some even died. They scrapped those vaccines as well. Same thing with Dengue fever vaccines and even one for measles. </p>
