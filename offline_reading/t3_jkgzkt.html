<title>Why is "dirty" almost always used before a racist slur? Well, assuming someone is diseased (dirty) is a very easy way to completely dehumanize another person. If the "dirty" person's very being is an assumed attack on someone else's well being, they will feared and then hated.</title>

    <p><p>An acquaintance of mine's child "contracted" Covid a few days ago. Due to the child having Down Syndrome, battling any sickness is more complicated and unfortunately, the child ended up in the hospital. He is fully recovered now, thank goodness, but my acquaintance's Facebook post when he first found out his child "contracted Covid" was extremely alarming. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Welp, some dirty anti-masker got (child) sick." </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I wanted to call him out but didn't. But assuming someone has the virus with zero evidence is, in my mind, hateful. It's the exact same mindset that created separate water fountains or completely draining pools after use for African Americans. Think about it, did they create the separate water fountains solely out of racism? No, they created them because they assumed black folks carried diseases. It was an assumption that was applied to everyone, and sadly believed by everyone, and was then able to be enforced. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I want to be clear that I'm not comparing the amount of suffering black people have endured at the hand of injustice with this current situation AT ALL... just that the mindset that allowed for prejudice and hatred is being fomented in almost everyone who believes masks work and if you don't wear one, you are spreading disease. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And it's getting worse every day as the rising cases ("confirmed" by the completely fraudulent PCR testing using synthetic virus material based on computer modeling and not an actual virus!!!!!!!!!) are being blamed on the lack of mask use. I see so much hatred already and am so fucking scared for more to come, each passing day, as we approach winter. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lastly, I am so glad I found this group. I have been feeling completely depressed as it seems everyone except me completely buys into the most bullshit narrative ever. Thank you for some semblance of sanity!</p></p>
