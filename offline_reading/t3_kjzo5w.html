    <strong>Not all doomers are same.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm at my mother's gf since a few weeks. </p>
<p>My gf and I dont have kids, her mother has 4 the youngest is 8.</p>
<p>My girlfriend is open to the possibility that something isn't right with the main narrative, she still dont want to take sides although I think she lean to believe there's some conspiracy behind this all, so once in a while she drop some truth to her family.</p>
<p>Whenever you have children I think is much more difficult to accept that there's a conspiracy, when my gf talk to her she ends up saying not to put this thoughts into her mind because she wants to be able to sleep. 
Her brothers twins in their early 20s they are sport guys that don't do drugs and have plans for the future. 
Many people whenever have children or pursue a career have some kind of contract with the state(we all have to some degree) and believing a conspiracy would be like accepting that their boss/partner is untrustworthy would be a really disappointing position since they would feel scammed and lost (like most of us in this sub)</p>
<p>If you accept the main narrative not only you're in the social side of herd but also is easier to face this moments since they feel comforted that your partner/boss has the best interest in you, so they can sleep better.</p>
<p>Many of them aren't dumb, there's so much highly intelligent people who blindly believe and defend the main narrative, they do it as a sort defense mechanism.</p>
<p>If you believe that the virus don't exist or its manmade you're open to the posibilitiy that the people running the show are capable of cause unlimited harm and that's a harder place to be.</p>
<p>I guess I just wanted to say that we have to understand other people position, and this way perhaps it will be easier to achieve our goals. </p>
<p>Until most of the people aren't ready to accept that who decides may not have best interest in them it will be hard to do a change. And this ofcourse is not only about covid 19 but about lot.</p>
<p>Once you're open to the lie the next question that would ask yourself is how long does the lie goes.</p></p>

        <p>Iâ€™m saddened that one side of my family seems to have bought into the hysteria entirely and insisted on everyone wearing face diapers to our Christmas gathering. These are well educated people who all happen to be lifelong Democrats who unfortunately believe everything they read in the news/the government says as gospel. Very much intellectually intelligent, but when it comes to common sense, idiots. Made for a sad experience.</p>

        <p>I don't know man, if i truly love someone i'd do everything in my power to wake them up. That's what i'd like them to do for me if i were in their position. No matter how hard the reality is, you have to face it at some point, and the sooner the better.</p>

        <p>You made a post calling your own girlfriend a derogatory term for the world to see. You must have a rock solid relationship.</p>
<p>I really wish people would stop using the word "doomer" as it has a meaning that doesn't fit the context it's being used in these days. Keeping on using it only furthers the deconstruction of language.</p>

        <p>I totally agree with you, my gf is the worst not only a doomer but she is also a grandma killer as well since she don't take a definite side since she hates the idea of being a conspiracy theorist. She only wears the mask not to get a fine and she leaves the nose outside. Yesterday she went to the giftshops and I asked her if she enjoyed killing grandmas while shopping with the nose put and she said yes, while she is concerned about going to visit her grandmother.</p>
<p>I had to think a lot for the title, I swear I tried to avoid the doomer word, but I didn't find any other word. However I do agree that both conspiracy theorist grandma killer and doomer violent terms by nature and by design. </p>
<p>Any solution to suggest?</p>
