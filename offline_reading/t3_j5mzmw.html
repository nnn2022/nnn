        <p>Honestly I kinda doubt the White House has any of that stuff. It's a remarkably small building with desks and staffers jammed pretty much everywhere they could find a square inch to pack them, actual airflow probably isn't that great. Remember, the last major rebuild of the White House was during the Truman administration, with a big redecoration under Kennedy. Even with piecemeal upgrades and secret goodies the building itself is quite obsolescent by modern standards. It's not an NBC-sealed fortress of hygiene, there are separate places for the President and staff to be moved for that kind of protection.</p>

        <p>Oh for sure.  That building is over 200 years old.  Any building that old is going to be turd underneath all of band aides itâ€™s been given over the years.</p>
