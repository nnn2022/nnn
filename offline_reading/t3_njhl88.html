    <strong>Question about vaccine shedding</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone, I hope you don't mind me asking as I know it has been spoken about a lot recently. I am mostly a lurker here and I feel like this is the only place that would be accepting of such a question (or questions about anything!) My husband is due to start training for a new job soon and it will require close contact in both outdoor and enclosed spaces.</p>
<p>I have been reading so many accounts of people becoming unwell after being in contact with people who had the injections. My anxiety is a little heightened with this, so I wondered if you guys had any personal experiences with this - have you felt unwell after being around them or have you felt just the same as usual? We take vitamins to try and help our immune systems, anything else we could do? If any fellow women don't mind sharing regarding your cycles - has it been out of character or the same as usual? Would be interested and appreciate it to hear both sides of experiences whether you felt unwell or not. Thanks</p></p>

        <p>My cycle has been very messed up since my coworkers started getting the jab. I honestly don’t think it’s anything to be worried about, I can deal with a crazy cycle (which I doubt will be permanent). It’s more worrisome for pregnant women</p>

        <p>You can`t avoid this, unless you lock yourself into a bunker and come out few years later when they are done vaccinating, so preventing it is out of question. High intakes of protein S from those vaxxed takes place when we  talk about fluids, so as long as you avoid exchanging fluids with those vaxxed, the risk is lower. If you do however experience side effects, i would recommend a blood check, and take some supplements that maintain cellular health and regeneration as spike protein tends to damage the cells that form the tissue around your blood vessels.</p>

        <p>yes this happened to me. i had the two shortest cycles i've ever had in 7 years of tracking. i also get petechiae on my face after close contact with recently vaccinated (this happened multiple times - i NEVER had it occur before - there is no way it is just a coincidence).</p>
<p>i was really freaked out at first. however, i believe that this is just happening around RECENTLY vaccinated people. last night i was in very close contact with someone who had the vaccine over 2 months ago. no petechiae today. </p>
<p>i believe it's due to spike protein shedding after getting the vaccine which dissipates over time. obviously this is all just conjecture based on research i've done.</p>

Find a medical source, or scientific article, not a video from the blaze. for the sake of being open minded, I wouldnt use sources from reddit or really any social media.

        <p>The covid vaccine is different from a lot of vaccines, in that it doesn't contain a dead or weakened version of the virus. Rather than using a version of the virus to teach the body how to fight it off, the goal is to create antibodies to the protein that binds the virus to the body's cells. So this being the case, there is no risk of shedding from the vaccine</p>

        <p>not necessarily true. the pfizer insert says not to have sexual contact w a woman who is pregnant or trying to get pregnant , and to wait 7 weeks after jab.  spike proteins break down and have a residual that has to be excreted somehow from the body. so it’s possible.</p>

        <p>This isn't the case. The spike protein is a part of the virus that allows it to cling to the bodies cells. The virus has no way of attaching to the cells once the protein is stripped away. Essentially, the vaccine doesn't help to kill the virus, it just prevents it from taking hold within the body</p>

        <p>People I swear. In the name of honesty and truly seeking answers, I am trying to find a single reliable source saying that there can be shedding. I can't. Im looking at the CDC, Nebraska med, factcheck.org, reuter, etc. Im truly trying to prove your points to myself. I am exclusively finding this type of stuff:</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines “contain only instructions for making spike protein and are incapable of generating virus particles, so nothing can be shed,” said Dr Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the infectious diseases division at Brigham and Women's Hospital, one of the world’s top teaching hospitals and part of Harvard Medical School, in a statement emailed to Reuters.</p>
<p>If You're finding something reliable that proves me wrong I honestly want to be given that information</p>

        <p>Yes. This is Pfizer’s protocol for their Phase 1/2/3 studies. The Adverse Effect (AE) and Serious Adverse Effect (SAE) sections and definitions are common and required to be included in any clinical phase protocol. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that an AE can be anything that happens during the trial, in particular phase 3 are far more stringent… for example: if you were a pregnant woman and part of a trial for a heart med and you broke your arm or got into a car accident. The clinic team is required to report this as an adverse event. Post-trial this is all evaluated.</p>
<p>Now if we’re talking SAEs that’s a different story. This is more akin to the pause AstraZeneca had. Regulators and or Medical investigators will put a safety pause on studies due to SAEs and that hold stays until cleared. </p>
<p>The examples of SAEs are not what will or could happen but examples of possibilities and what to do in the event that it occurs during the trial.</p>

        <p>Maybe quoting the part of page 67 of the Pfizer doc. you are linking would help? I just read through a few pages before and after and there is nothing re spike protein shedding.</p>
