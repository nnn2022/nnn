    <strong>Most people know deep down</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like most people know in at some level what is going on here. I think a lot of people just don’t want to face the truth and actually think about all of it rationally. I actually try to avoid thinking about this entire shitshow as much as I can because the truth is just so damn depressing. I feel like it’s just hard for people to face the truth and it’s just easier to go along with it all and act like everything’s ok. I get so depressed when I actually let myself think about everything that’s happened this year and how awful the situation we are in is. I’ve broken down crying numerous times and I’ve had periods of being really angry which isn’t like me. I feel like everyone’s gone insane. I can’t express how I feel to my family either they just say “it is what it is.” I’m baffled by their mindset honestly and I’m so angry deep down. Last time I got mad at hearing daily covid case numbers in our area everyday by my mom she said there’s no reason to be mad and I was being ridiculous. I’m so tired of hearing about covid cases I don’t give a damn and I don’t know why my family does either. Honestly I’m just so lost right now I feel like I don’t even know what to do anymore it’s exhausting and it never ends</p></p>

        <p>I was furious about all this for months but eventually realised I had to let go of the anger because it was affecting my health and relationships. You can keep an eye on what's happening but ignore the propaganda and find some positive activities to stay sane.</p>

        <p>This is what we have this sub for. It honestly keeps me sane because IRL I only have one friend with this mindset. I'm also finding it hard to look forward to anything. My social life is dead and the plans I had for the future all included traveling, concerts etc and I don't know if they'll come back and what they will be like after this whole fiasco. I'm lucky to have a job and a home but I know many people have been through a lot worse than just having their social lives sacrificed...</p>

        <p>I know how you feel I literally see nothing in my future right now I’m 26 married for 7 years with a 7 year old son and we are living with my parents because my husband can’t find a decent job now after he lost his last job in March. I planned to have another child by now but I really don’t know if I want to bring another child into the world now. I feel bad enough for my son having to be so isolated I just feel like a failure of a parent. Sorry I’m ranting so much lol thank god for this sub though</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you're going through this. You don't have to apologise for expressing your feelings. I empathise with your hopelessness for the future. I'm not a parent, but I recommend the related sub r/NoNewNormalParenting where you might find other parents feeling like you do.</p>

        <p>I agree with this sentiment.</p>
<p>Reddit/Facebook/Twitter is a highly skewed vocal part of the internet, where groupthink prevails and dissenters stay quiet for the most part. Twitter and Reddit are not accurate cross sections of society.</p>
<p>This is anecdotal at best but my Experience is there is around 60% of people in the real world that think something is fishy, and openly will talk to me about it but wouldn’t dream of saying anything online, due to the culture we all live in.</p>
<p>20% are terrified and another 20% or so can’t decide but don’t trust what’s happening. Go and actually speak to real people, not the twitterati and redditors who live online.</p>
<p>I speak to around 100 new families a week in my line of work mostly elites/upper and upper middle classes. </p>
<p>Some have worked on the vaccine and also agree that this is utter horse shit, but they keep turning over in the machine as it pays their multimillion pound houses and Maserati.</p>
<p>The only one I know who is in a state of covid fear in my workplace, is woke as hell. Shares BLM pics and virtue signals all the time despite being the most racist pos, and making the work day a misery for our 3 previous immigrant workers. </p>
<p>So what does that tell you? It’s anecdotal I know but i feel it’s accurate.</p>

        <p>Everyone I know is STILL scared of it.
I’ve been having emotional breakdowns over and over for months.
I can’t really talk to someone who understands, they want to be in the “high risk group”.
They’ve argued with me I’m not looking at the science. </p>
<p>They tell me this won’t last forever...yet they refuse to mask off and live.</p>

        <p>Exactly.<br>
I know someone who feared it, got it, and lived through it. <br>
Now he boasts how everything ought to remain closed forever, just so HE doesn't get sick again.  <br>
His symptom description sounds exactly like the flu to me.<br>
"Not even, this is worse than the flu, I couldn't eat for 2 weeks, and then it took another 2 weeks to feel better!"<br>
Still sounds like the flu to me.</p>
