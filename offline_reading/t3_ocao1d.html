    <strong>After the immune system was not challenged for months, due to Lockdowns, Social Distancing &amp; Co. suddenly many viral diseases appear in Israel, which are otherwise hardly there in summer. Surprise!</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;"We have never seen anything like it," said Tal Brosh, head of the infectious diseases department at Samson Assuta Ashdod Hospital. Specifically, the respiratory syncytial virus (RS virus) is currently spreading in Israel. It is the world's most common cause of acute respiratory infections in young children and infants and usually occurs together with the flu. Infection can often take a dangerous course, especially for young children and older adults.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Unusual spread in summer<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Even if the spread of this severe cold does not seem particularly startling at first glance, the occurrence of the wave of infections in summer is extremely unusual. "Usually we see the virus go away in the summer, but if we look at the numbers now, it looks like the winters in previous years," said Brosh.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We have seen an increasing number of respiratory diseases since spring, and there has been an increase in RSV cases since May. ‚ÄùIn winter 2020/21, however - as with the flu - there was not a single case of infection.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The number of children hospitalized with respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders was also exceptional at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, said Giora Weiser, director of the emergency pediatric medicine department.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"Children go back to school, see friends and have normal lives again, and these viruses take revenge," said Weiser.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The experts agree that no one can predict how this wave of infections will behave in the coming weeks and months. "This is not a pandemic, these viruses exist in the country and illnesses occur every winter," said Brosh. "What's weird now is the season, and we don't know if this will wear off soon or last until next winter and what will actually happen next winter."</p>

<p>Who would have thought that? If you not let your immune system do any work at all, for an extreme long period of time, it will backfire. But this is clearly a conspiracy theory i guess. </p>
