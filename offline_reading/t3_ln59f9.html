    <p><p>You gotta realise, there is no way in hell there is a publicly available conspiracy that hundreds, thousands and in some cases millions of people openly congregate to discuss online and share it around.  </p>
<p>By taking the facts we see, they weave a yarn leading in the totally wrong direction.  </p>
<p>Just because you dont believe the status quo, doesnt mean what you do believe is any better.  </p>
<p>If you havent sat down with primary data and analysised it, if you havent read the papers, watched the interviews,checked the references and investigated it IN DEPTH and come to a conclusion INDEPENDANTLY.   </p>
<p>You are definately wrong.  Cos of all the mad shit out there floating around, you can be damn sure the truth isnt part of it.  </p>
<p>Damn near every  new idea in the last 10 years that has been part of conpiracy sites and groups is so obviously manipulation it seems just as absurd as double masking when you think you got it all figured out and its a secret paedophile cabal depopulating the world.   </p>
<p>Its fine not to know whats going on,  you dont have to post the synopsis of your cookie cutter theory on every  post here.</p></p>

        <p>\&rt;  You gotta realise, there is no way in hell there is a publicly available conspiracy that hundreds, thousands and in some cases millions of people openly congregate to discuss online and share it around that countains even the remotest fragment of truth. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories ONLY have any chance of being true if they're not being shared or spoken or debated by any network of people? </p>
<p>Bad metric.</p>
