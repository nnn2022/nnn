        <p>In 2020, politics rules science. If unbiased science determines masks aren't effective, and later it becomes politically advantageous to push them as effective, you can bet the "science" can and will be changed in a moment's notice.</p>

        <p>I once asked someone on Reddit to show me the specific scientific studies that Fauci et al read and that made them change their stance on masks.</p>
<p>He kept supplying links with no context that he clearly did not read, all of which were either not about about masks, were written after Fauci changed his stance, or were not scientific studies. And when I'd pointed this out it was just more links he clearly hadn't read.</p>

        <p>I've found pre-2020 medical research papers questioning the use of surgical masks in actual surgical settings. It seemed like it was still an open question that's been left unresolved.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Here's an example from the dark ages of 2015: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480558/</p>
<p>&rt;Facemasks do have a clear role in maintaining the social cleanliness of surgical staff, but evidence is lacking to suggest that they confer protection from infection either to patients or to the surgeons that wear them.
&rt;
&rt;Given that there is no evidence that they cause any harm either, proponents would rather err on the side of caution and encourage their continued use, stressing that there is no room for complacency when it comes to ensuring patient safety.25 This opinion is similarly echoed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines which assert that mask usage contributes towards ‘maintaining theatre discipline’.
&rt;
&rt;Another unavoidable aspect of this debate is that of public perception. In the public psyche, facemasks have become so strongly associated with safe and proper surgical practice that their disposal could cause unnecessary patient distress. Indeed, the response on various medical forums following Mr Ahmed’s decision not to wear a mask during his broadcasted surgeries would reflect the prevalence of such a belief among the public.
&rt;
&rt;It is clear that more studies are required before any absolute conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness or, indeed, ineffectiveness of surgical masks.</p>

        <p>It's not just masks. I did a Google search for all research on coronaviruses from before 2020 and learnt everything back in March that it's taken until recently for the "experts" to learn. Things like how the symptoms are exactly the same as for SARS and MERS (just different strength), or that it's seasonal, or that chronic fatigue syndrome is possible from other coronaviruses, or in fact any viral infection, yet all these things were complete unknowns to the "experts" when they decided to wipe the slate clean on any prior research back in March. In all honesty it just adds to the idea that its all a conspiracy. At no other time would scientists say "well have to start all over again with this one!" when they have valid research in front of them. They'd just expand on what's already been done, and until they have new data they'd rely on the closets info they had from previous studies, but they didn't even do that.</p>

        <p>Oh! I found <a href="https://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/n95masks.html">this article</a> about N95 masks for anthrax from 2003 from The Washington Post. It doesn't exactly recommend them. Some highlights:</p>
<p>&rt; Sold at medical supply and hardware stores, they're the lightweight, nose-and-mouth respirators designed for medical settings and good for blocking allergens when mowing the lawn. Which begs the question: Can a <strong>mowing aid fend off a weapon of mass destruction?</strong> How effective would they be in a biological, chemical or nuclear attack?</p>
<p>&rt; "Not much, but better than nothing," says Victor Utgoff, a defense analyst at the Alexandria-based private Institute for Defense Analysis who has studied gas masks. <strong>"They generally protect you from getting particles into your lungs, paint chips and things like that."</strong></p>
<p>&rt; The N95 is made by various manufacturers under different names, from MSA's "Affinity Foldable Respirator" to 3M's "Particulate Respirator." Look for "NIOSH N95" on the package; the "N95" is a government efficiency rating that means <strong>the mask blocks about 95 percent of particles that are 0.3 microns in size or larger.</strong> [COVID19 is .12 microns]</p>
<p>&rt; "Does it have a nose piece like a metal clip you can bend over your nose? That's a better model because the big kicker here is getting a good fit," Utgoff says.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Bad fits are deadly.</strong> Contaminated air breathed from around the unfiltered edges instead of through the N95-rated material undermines the purpose of a mask.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>And, got a beard? "Shave it,"</strong> says Breysse, who <strong>recommends duct-taping the mask to your face</strong> to make a good fit.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>"For you to take a respirator and put it on without any training or fitting probably wouldn't give you the protection you are expecting,"</strong> says Ron Herring, general manager of the Safety Products Division at Pittsburgh-based MSA.</p>
<p>&rt; Another problem is that the single-use masks don't last. "They are disposable because they deteriorate with sweat and wear and age," Breysse says.</p>
<p>You can find some pretty interesting stuff on google if you limit the date to before april 2020! There was also a great tv news report from march pooh-poohing masks someone posted here a while ago, but I've been unable to find it.</p>

        <p>Emphasis on <strong>pre March</strong> because a lot of them have editor notes added that claim support for state maskspolicy but offer no counter to their previous research.  </p>
<p>One of the most egregious is that of the New England Journal of Medicine </p>

        <p>It’s just so crazy to me that literally all the science and data from before March was against widespread mask usage by the general public. Does anyone have any idea what changed? Or who changed it? Why was there a sudden shift? I’m also just trying to remember the timeline back in March and April. Did the CDC change their recommendations on masks first? Or did the states just start mandating them first and then the CDC changed their guidelines?</p>
