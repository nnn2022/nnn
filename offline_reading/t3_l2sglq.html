    <strong>Genuine Question</strong>
    <p><p>I guess I'm a "Doomer" but I wanted to ask someone on this sub. Why do you all mind wearing masks? Personally, I know someone who is immunocompromised and even though I almost never see them I happily stay home and wear a mask wherever I am just on the off chance that I maybe get it and maybe give it to someone who has a lower chance of survival.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Pretty sure I'm gonna get banned but just wanted to ask.</p></p>

        <p>You won't get banned for asking respectful questions. I think the majority of us here (and folks will jump to correct me if I am wrong) understand that the science shows little to no asymptomatic transmission of the virus. While many of us would be totally fine with recommending symptomatic folks wear masks (like many countries already do), which needs to be culturally normalized, we also recognize that healthy people should not need to wear them at all unless they want to, which is cool by me. </p>
<p>Frankly, I like wearing a mask at times, especially in crowded areas because some masks do a good job at maintaining personal privacy by thwarting facial recognition technology. However, forcing the entire country to do so is far beyond reasonable. </p>
<p>The majority of folks with complications from COVID-19 have other comorbidities, most of which are brought on by terrible nutrition and exercise practices and are completely preventable. On a fundamental level, healthy people should not be punished for the poor decisions of the sick.</p>

        <p>My mom is massively high risk. </p>
<p>My dad works outside of the house. He got covid months ago, is now immune, and I feel way safer knowing he won't spread it to my mother now.</p>
<p>I'd rather just get it instead of spending the rest of my life at home wondering if I'm an "asymptomatic speader."</p>
<p>Especially so I dont have to try to prevent a hypothetical butterfly effect of spread. Imagining scenarios where I could have covid and kill some hypothetical person somewhere someday is exhausting!</p>

        <p>It's a very reasonable question. But I do agree with others that I think the premise is a bit off - you'll find a mix of people with a mix of opinions and a mix of reasons here. </p>
<p>I'll give you my personal opinions on why I dislike it, there's a few. </p>
<p>I think the number one reason beyond anything is the fact that many places in the world outright removed the choice for people to do as they see fit. I actually didn't have much of a problem with them until then. And it's also how they went about it, basically forcing private businesses to comply or face penalties whether they wanted to or not.</p>
<p>And before someone says "well we have to mandate it because people won't follow it," unfortunately, that is the consequence of allowing free choice in our society. If we start to remove that, then we are essentially changing our society to be something else, there by taking away the bad but also the good.</p>
<p>That leads into another point - it's the zeal with which this was mandated. The very fact that some people won't even listen to arguments against it ("just shut up and wear your mask") turns off many people, and instinctively they will do exactly the opposite, whether out of spite or doubt. </p>
<p>Honestly, so much of this could have been solved if people simply allowed others to make informed choices themselves and accepted that there would be those who chose differently. But the screaming irrational ones took that option away, since the governments catered to them. Then again I'm not surprised, since many of these people really can't stand the fact that others have autonomy.</p>

        <p>Why I don't wear a mask:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm not sick and not afraid of getting sick, on the off chance of catching it I trust my body to handle it like every other respiratory virus before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it feels uncomfortable on my face, makes me sweat and restricts my breathing.</p>

<li>
<p>I rely heavily on facial expressions and clear enunciation as I live in a country where the language is my third.</p>

        <p>Youâ€™re the one who needs to say why we should wear a mask.</p>
<p>If I say you should kill yourself, and you donâ€™t, you think you need to explain to me why you shouldnâ€™t? Or is it me that needs to explain to you why you should?</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s right, the person who claims something, is the one who should bring evidence and prove it, if heâ€™s not able to prove his claim, I donâ€™t need any evidence to prove him wrong. </p>

        <p>My eldest kid has mild autism, which seems to manifest most around sensory stuff. He gets nauseous if things get too hot, stuffy or if he feels trapped. My father and I seem to get this too, but less so. Anyway, wearing a mask in heat for more than five minutes is apparently very difficult for him. This, accompanied with the fact that social media is full of people praising no-masker pogrums, means he doesnâ€™t want to go out now.</p>
<p>So basically, although healthy, he has to stay away from town/shops/parks. All this for what? Unhealthy people still isolate along with everyone else.</p>
<p>I have to be honest, if someone has a weak immune system for whatever reason, then sort something out. Wear a respirator, stay in, whatever. But donâ€™t make someone else suffer for you.</p>
