    <strong>Respiratory Therapist here...gonna open up a bit</strong>
    <p><p>I was coerced into getting the t-dap vaccine for work about 8 years ago. My arm was completely fucked up after it and my skin turned red for a couple days. After about the 3rd or 4th day, I started getting little white spots of peeling skin. No big deal, but after a weak or 2, it got out of control. I went to a general practice doc and he didn't know shit. Went to a dermatologist and was diagnosed with psoriasis. Now, I cannot prove I got the psoriasis from the vax, but I know in my heart that it was the cause. Wow...put something in your system to trick your immune system and then later on get an auto immune disease. I need to mention that psoriasis meds are the number one money maker for pharma right now.  Well, as the story goes on, psoriasis puts you a great risk for a heart attack. Hot damn...I had an st-elevation myocardial infarction after 3 years with psoriasis. Thanks big pharma. I had a stent placed and ended up with no heart damage (I had massive collateral circulation helping my heart tissue to survive). Lucky as fuck. I had a coin flip chance of survival. Saying goodbye to my boys as teh medics rushed me away was surreal...thanks for that big pharma. Anyway, I decided to take control of my health and started eating only pure food. A crazy diet...super boring, but extremely nutritious. I starting exercising again. Meditation. Supplementation. I was able to get off all my meds...psoriasis meds, statin, beta blocker. All my labs were perfect, my skin was relatively clear...everything all good now. My point is...I do all this...take personal responsibility for my own health so that I don't need medications. Now, they're firing me for not taking a medicine that they think will protect them and will probably harm me. This is some of the most hideous shit in the history of mankind. The world has flipped upside down. All these fat asses walking the streets taking all their pharma meds and eating shit food? WTF is wrong with people. Will people wake up when their putting guns to our heads and forcing us onto rail cars? What will it take?</p></p>

        <p>They used they constant fear and propaganda to create a mass psychosis. The mass is in psychosis right now and can’t think straight, it could go real bad if people don’t wake up, try to educate your peers as much as possible and stand your ground, don’t be afraid to be speak up and some will wake up</p>

        <p>&rt; I was coerced into getting the t-dap vaccine for work about 8 years ago. </p>
<p>I also got the TDAP vaccine 8 years ago.  Within 2-3 days, I ended up with a severe case of myocarditis and had to spend 3 days in the hospital.</p>
<p>Luckily, no damage.  </p>
<p>I did follow up with a cardiologist for a year.  He said if I wanted a vaccine in the future, to see an allergist/immunologist and get their opinion as that's not his area of expertise.  He can treat the heart issues that may arise, but doesn't know much about the immunization end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>I of course work at a community college in NY state.  Of course Cuomo is a douche bag, and will probably require college staff to get vaccinated.  So, I went to see an allergist/immunologist.  Of course, she was like "I won't write you an excuse.  It's unlikely to happen again with a different vaccine.  The reports of myocarditis from COVID vaccines are rare.  You are more at risk getting myocarditis from COVID.  I also cannot test if you will get myocarditis from a vaccine in the first place.  So, I suggest getting a COVID vaccine."</p>
