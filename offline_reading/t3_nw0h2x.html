    <strong>Possible my depression is linked to the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>So before I mentioned I would update you all if I noticed anything weird with my vaccine. It's been a month and I've had depression during the pandemic. Yet it feels worse since I've gotten vaccinated. During the whole time of the pandemic even though I was depressed I never thought about suicide. Since the vaccine not only have I had frequent thoughts I was able to say out loud "I don't want to be here anymore". That's fucking scary compared to before when I still cared about life. Even though it was still rough before. I've heard a lot of the times for different medicines advertised on TV state possible side effects include depression or suicidal thoughts.</p></p>

        <p>Could it be because you were told, constantly, that if you just did what was asked and got the shot you could go back to "normal" and then you realized you had been lied to?</p>

        <p>OP, don't give up. Jesus loves you and wants to change your life. Just give Him a chance. I'm pray for you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>'Come to me all of you who are tired. You are like people who have worked for a long time. You are like people who have carried heavy things. Come to me. If you do that, you will find a place to rest. Do what I teach you to do. Listen to my message and learn from me what is true. I am very kind and I do not make myself important. I will help you. Then you will have peace in your mind. I will not tell you to do things that are too difficult. I will not tell you to carry anything that is too heavy for you.â€™'  - Matthew 11:28-30</p>

        <p>The story of Jesus is a story of human sacrifice, specifically: human sacrifice to appease God.</p>
<p>However human sacrifice is an <strong>abomination</strong> to God.</p>
<p>Carefully keep in mind that human sacrifice is a specific type of murder.  The story of Jesus is a story about a murder that people such as you think is a good thing.</p>
<p>Among the people that respond to this being pointed out to them, the response invariably has the meaning: "No, no you see what REALLY happened is that humans actually murdered God.  Yay!  Yeah, you see:  God had always <em>wanted</em> humans to murder Him!"</p>
<p>The type of deception that has been perpetrated against all of humanity for the past ~16 months (such reversing the meaning of very many critical things, and getting people to actually believe in those falsehoods) is simply an outgrowth of that exact same type of deception of that last ~2000+ years.</p>

        <p>Why do you want to make this be about me?</p>
<p>Simply reject human sacrifice (particularly human sacrifice to appease God), reject the mythology that God wanted humans to murder Him, and reject the mythology that humans did murder God.  It's not that hard.</p>

        <p>I just want to know if you are jew, so I can reply with old testament.</p>
<p>Jesus was 100% human and 100% God, his sacrifice was agreed by him when He decided not to bow and worship Satan. He willingly went to the cross in our place. He willingly decided to separate from God when He took our sins over him. But He beat death and resurrected. Now, He sits on the throne at God right hand and will judge all people, good and bad according to their deeds. Those who have their names written in the book of life, because they believed in Him, will be spared from condemnation and welcomed into heaven.</p>
<p>There is still time my friend, believe in Jesus and you will also have eternal life starting now.</p>

        <p>I don't think you are imagining it, I had a theory about what could cause it.  You could try  L-Alpha Glycerophosphocholine (Alpha GPC),  it helps you body make Acetylcholine (ACh). ( see https://www.rxlist.com/alpha-gpc/supplements.htm ) 
It has to do with immune cell function, and could be the reason some antihistamines cause depression and suicidal ideation, because antihistamines are anti-acetylcholinegenic.</p>

'Furthermore during infection this immune-derived ACh is necessary for the T cells to migrate into infected tissues'</p>

        <p>Friend, I hear you. You have infinite value as a unique human being that you are, don't let your mind trick you into thinking otherwise. Don't let the <em>exterior circumstances</em> dictate your inner state. I believe you can do it.</p>
<p>Also, on a physical level, maybe look into gamma-amino butyricÂ acid (GABA) supplements. There is evidence that this amino acid may help regulate the chemical imbalance that causes these thoughts.</p>
