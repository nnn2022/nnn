        <p>I think it means that in a vaccine trial, the placebo might be another vaccine that is known to be safe. The benefit of this is being able to discern significant side-effects that can be attributed to the vaccine being tested, by removing from the list of side-effects, the "normal" side-effects that are observed with the placebo vaccine.</p>
<p>OP's observation is that he had a sore arm and body aches with the placebo <em>and</em> the real vaccine. Those side-effects can be <em>subtracted</em> from the list of vaccine-unique side-effects, because they were encountered with the placebo vaccine.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, they are only going to follow up on the saline placebo group for 6 months. So things like autoimmune issues that often take a while to develop won't be attributed to the vaccine. They weren't going to have a saline placebo group at all, but ICAN (Informed Consent Action Network) made them have one.</p>

        <p>Interesting, thanks!</p>
<p>Weird that they wouldn't follow up on the saline placebo group longer, since that's in a way <em>protective</em> of their product. How expensive is it to send out an email?</p>

        <p>Ah, that makes sense. I'm pretty sure they are allowed to get it whenever they want -- that's a required ethical thing for the trials -- but I guess after 6 months they will be <em>invited</em> to get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>No. Usually, in a vaccine trial, the vaccine is not available to the general public until the trial is over and the vaccine is licensed. The Covid vaccines are available to the general public under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) before the trials are finished and before the vaccines are licensed.</p>

        <p>Is the general population in excellent health? No. Could some health problems be from the meningitis vaccine? We don't know and cannot know because the meningitis vaccine was never tested against an inert placebo. It was tested against a different vaccine. Well, that other vaccine it was tested against is <em>like</em> an inert placebo, is it not? NO. Because that other vaccine was tested against a different vaccine, which was tested against a different vaccine. Do you see how this is a problem?</p>

        <p>&rt; Do you see how this is a problem?</p>
<p>Not if everyone is safe!</p>
<p>If someone said Vaccine X is safe because it only killed 1% of those who took it, which is the same death rate as the placebo vaccine Y which also killed 1% -- <em>that</em> would be a problem. The fact that Y kills 1% doesn't mean it's OK for X to kill 1%. Obviously it would be a bad idea to use a placebo vaccine that has serious side-effects.</p>
<p>If we see 1% hair-falls-out with X and 0% hair-falls-out with Y -- then we infer that X causes hair-falls-out for 1% of its recipients. We can correctly make that inference even though the placebo group is a vaccine.</p>
<p>With Pfizer and Moderna, people <em>did not</em> die, period -- right? I haven't been following it closely.</p>

<p>That might be true for a healthy 20-year-old. I'm high-risk 6 ways (old, fat, diabetic, hypertensive, male, blood type A) so the probability of covid being <em>fatal</em> for me is on the order of 7-10%. I'm 100% certain that the vaccine won't kill me.</p>

        <p>Cheer up, 7-10% is a complete myth.  Check back when you're late stage heart disease, renal failure, or cancer.  The majority of covid deaths are nursing home patients and over 85.</p>
<p>A 100% safe vaccine is also a complete myth (ask the Norwegians), and the severity of the response scales with your health too.  Also, the worse your immune system, the less chance of producing a useful and lasting immunity.</p>
<p>Vaccines are for the healthy to build herd immunity, not the unhealthy.  I know science got rewritten in 2020, so you have to look back an extra year to remember how biology actually works.</p>

        <p>I went through <a href="https://19andme.covid19.mathematica.org/">this site</a>, got risk of death 3.9%. That's better than I thought it would be. <a href="https://covid19risktools.com:8443/riskcalculator">The site I used before</a> that produced the higher number is broken.</p>
<p>&rt; Among people who are the same age, sex, and health status as you and get sick from COVID-19, the risk of hospitalization is 39% , the risk of requiring an ICU is 6.5% , and the risk of not surviving is 3.9% .</p>

        <p>Do they use the who-mandated covid fatality determination to establish those rates? Because no other disease has been counted this way, nor have we ever used pcr as the sole diagnostic tool. There's a rhode island foia for pcr cycle data that shows at least half of the "positive" tests were at tok high a cycle count to actually have any liklihood of live virus present. I.e., half of the positive tests didn't have covid. So if you're using that data to calculate deaths, your risk value is still an overestimate.</p>
<p>Finding quality data in 2020 has been rough.</p>

        <p>It's a web site that produces a number. There's no insight into the algorithm or the data it's based on.</p>
<p>&rt; So if you're using that data to calculate deaths, your risk value is still an overestimate.</p>
<p>The studies that look at excess deaths have found that covid deaths are <em>under</em> estimated. Check out /r/covid19 to verify. That's the strictly-science sub, IMO <em>the</em> authoritative source for covid information on reddit.</p>

        <p>It's a heavily moderated and censored sub actually. You get banned for even mentioning subs such as LockdownSkepticism. I spent months there until they got aggressive with the bannings, feel free to check my post history. </p>
<p>But excess deaths are an interesting metric. They're up in the US, but not in Europe. They're no higher in Sweden than its neighbors. Euromomo is the source of most of this data, and people like ivor Cummins have done a lot of analysis of the data. We know there are a variety of second order impacts of lockdowns, so not all excess deaths can be attributed to covid. San Francisco was reporting more drug overdose deaths tha covid deaths. Violent crime is up across the country as well.</p>
<p>If your data analysis glosses over other possible causes of death, you should be more skeptical of it. As I said, quality data is hard to come across, especially when the cdc directly mandates (via covid alert #2 from March 24) such lenient and unscientific reporting. The UK as well, had to rescind and recalculate deaths after using the "any positive pcr test 30 days before a death should be declared a covid death" policy. This is not how real science works.</p>
<p>And if your risk assessment site doesn't cite sources and methods, you should be skeptical of that as well. It may be right, but it should never tell people to be afraid without great caution and appropriate caveats.</p>
