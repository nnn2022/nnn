        <p>Why are universities and doctors going along with this censoring of data?! What do they have to gain from this? </p>
<p>This is why people think we’re crazy. This data is out there and it’s real and proven real. But then mysteriously deleted and labeled as “misinformation” even though it’s very clear JHU never hinted that any of the data was false. </p>

        <p>My wife is a professor. The answer is institutional pressure. My wife's research isn't related to covid but her stuff does dovetail with a lot of "woke" culture stuff (which she stands against). She is finding it harder and harder to do real research because the "woke" narrative has taken over.</p>

        <p>They have since released a longer statement accusing the author of not being a doctor (because you have to be a doctor to study statistics, apparently) and callously "trivializing" covid deaths. Their refutation of the claims amounts to "but the CDC said...", completely ignoring that the entire point of her article was to critique the CDC's accounting practices. Also ignores the fact that her data comes directly from...CDC sources. </p>
<p>The fact of a dissent from the official narrative is being presented as proof of dishonesty and malicious intent. We no longer have an academy or a scientific community, we have a Ministry of Truth.</p>

        <p>My wife is a college professor and researcher and she told me this morning that this is actually terrifying to her. She grew up in the Soviet era and knows all too well how governments and institutions censor people to keep the narrative pure. </p>
<p>And think about this... we now have one of the most credible medical institutions in the world deleting data to keep people "on message". </p>
<p>The data showed what we knew months ago. The elderly who are dying would have died anyway this year or within a few months. Except now instead of dying of advanced cancers and dementia they are dying of covid. One death replaces another and the total number of deaths remains the same. </p>
<p>The crisis is a political one not a medical one. </p>
<p>That is chilling.</p>

        <p>This is terrifying, it always has been since the very start when the real facts about covid were not disseminated.  It is terrifying because it is actual, verifiable proof that there is a conspiracy with malicious intent happening, because there is no other explanation for why a well reasoned article citing non-controversial statistics from mainstream sources would be erased other than that.  No, it isn't incompetence, it is malicious.  And that, is terrifying.  What is even worse, is people like us are labelled as deluded conspiracy theorists because we know the truth and once you know, you can't go back to not knowing and join in the farce with the rest of the populace.  Maybe I'm an outlier in this though because I was pretty 'awake' from the very start, I was against lockdown before it was even implemented in the UK and couldn't understand what was happening, what I wasn't awake to though was that this is an actively malicious plan being enacted against us, not a 'natural' mass hysteria or incompetent politics.  To know that and know it is true, is incredibly scary and makes you feel insane.</p>

        <p>This story goes along with what I have been saying for months. We know that viruses of all kinds cause complications. Before 2020 (hell, before this spring!), if someone died of a heart attack, they rarely did a flu swab to discover if flu was the reason behind it -- even though myocarditis is mostly caused by viral respiratory infections like flu. Anyone who dies now gets a COVID swab, and if it's positive, not only do they get counted as a COVID death, but everything wrong with them gets listed as potentially caused by coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>On top of that, we know that most people infected with the virus have either no symptoms or very mild symptoms, easily mistakable for typical conditions like allergies and changes in weather. Before 2020, if someone got sick enough to need medical attention, they'd get tested for flu and/or strep. Now they add COVID to the mix, but if more than one is positive, which one is causing the symptoms? Is it symptomatic strep and asymptomatic COVID? All three share roughly the same set of symptoms, so how could anyone know for sure?</p>

        <p>This is concerning. 
But wasn't there a post yesterday that proved US has approx 300000 excess deaths this year?</p>

        <p>Direct 2019/2020 excess death comparisons are misleading. Deaths increase every year in the US. <a href="https://www.prb.org/usdata/indicator/deaths/chart">U.S. Indicators: Total Deaths - PRB</a></p>
<p>Feel free to look. About a 20,000-30,000 increase every year from what I see. Also all these death counts are provisional. We likely won't have the official death number for awhile for 2020. The 2019 one is still hard to find.</p>

        <p>There may be more deaths this year, I’m not denying that. And yes, they may be due to Covid (without going into the intricacies of what is and isn’t a Covid death and weather that person would have died anyway). </p>
<p>What I don’t agree with is this being used as a justification to limit/control people’s social interactions and general freedom in life. Especially when it’s being presented without context. </p>
<p>E.g. back in the early 2000s in the UK, the population was 55million with roughly 600k deaths/year. In 2007 (I think) this suddenly dropped to 500k and stayed there for several years (no reporting of this then, or now). In 2013 and 2015, there were 20k and 40k more deaths than the previous 5years, was there mass panic and restrictions then? No. Do we have a more severe respiratory disease every few years? Yes. Have the last few years seen an overall decrease in deaths and a milder respiratory virus, yes. The population is now 70million. Are 75% of “Covid deaths” over 75, yes. Are 90% of “Covid deaths” already critically ill with heart disease, cancer, dementia or clinical obesity (BMI over 30), yes. </p>
<p>Is there a better and more rational response to this virus? Yes.</p>

        <p>It probably isn't a worse respiratory disease in most cases, it is just that if you have a year where more of the vulnerable survive, it stands to reason that you are far more likely to have a year where a lot more of them die the following year.  If you have a stretch of 2 or 3 years with very mild flu seasons, then you just have a 'normal' level season, then of course, you'll get a ton more deaths that make it look way worse because so many more vulnerable people are alive who would of died had there been worse strains in the previous years.  This is one of the reasons Sweden actually had a high number of 'covid' deaths - they had a very mild 2018/19 flu season, which lead to more vulnerable being alive who died to covid.</p>
