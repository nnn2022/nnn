    <strong>"Some on the left have seemed to want restrictions to go on for as long as possible"</strong>
    <p><p>A bit of self reflection from the Guardian (about the UK): </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<em>Some on the left, by contrast, have seemed to want restrictions to go on  for as long as possible: not just, perhaps, to keep the virus under  control but also because life in such conditions has ticked so many of  their political and philosophical boxes: a huge expansion of the state,  the primacy of “the science”, clear</em> <em>benefits for the environment</em><em>, and an insistence on collective sacrifice. With all this has come often</em> <em>swingeing judgment</em>  <em>of “Covidiots”, and the assumption that going maskless or being  sceptical about getting jabbed puts you in the same category as irate  callers to talk radio stations and the dreaded Laurence Fox.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<em>Thinking of government as essentially benign and well-intentioned is,  perhaps, the preserve of a certain section of the middle class. If you  have had any experience of the nastier aspects of policing, the benefits  system or this country’s immigration regime, you too might balk at the  idea of downloading the official Covid app, dutifully turning up for  your injection or registering Covid tests.</em></p>

        <p>Don't politicise a health issue, I'm not talking about politions or governments, mass surveillance, unbridled capitalism, big pharma or nefarious businessmen exploiting the pandemic. Listen to the people that know the most and have no horse in the race, the health experts, they dont want to control you or take away your rights. This whole sub is dumb propaganda that distorts your perception of reality ffs</p>

<p>A large reason why we are in this debacle is <em>because</em> we listened to those "experts". Only problem is, they are trained in their field of expertise, which is medicine. The last years have shown that they have no experience in analyzing the consequences of their recommendations in a broader picture. To weigh the costs and benefits of policies is what we've entrusted politicians to do. However, they have completely failed to do their job, and instead been too eager to grab more power.</p>
<p>Another example of the short-sightedness of medical professionals is in the insistence on full vaccination during an ongoing pandemic. According to Geert Vanden Bossche, that is something which has not been tried before on this scale, and also has severe risks. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtHfI00D_s4">In this interview from March this year</a>, he predicts what we're seeing right now with the delta variant; that the virus will mutate and spread to younger people but also the vaccinated.</p>
<p>So no, basing all policy of the entire world around people who cannot see beyond the tip of their own nose is not the way forward. Rather, it's the cause of problems we're in the middle of right now.</p>
