    <strong>Got fed up, so I told my truth.</strong>
    <p><p>In another group I posted a reply with a link to an article about Israel masking up, and possibly going on lockdown due to Delta. I asked how much longer will this nonsense continue.</p>
<p>Their response was that since it was to save "billions" from infection, and "millions" from death it was okay to keep masking back up, and locking back down.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I got fed up, and the following was my response:</p>
<p>&rt;Let's get this out of the way.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I'm about to become the most "Evil" person you have ever interacted with online. I will also add I have no illusions about what I am writing, and I include myself, my wife, my children, and everyone in this.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;People die.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Disease, accidents, and violence kills.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;No one, not one person, knows when their time to die will come. The only plausible exemption is an elder who has lived their life and they accept that they will be going to sleep that night and will not wake in the morning, and I consider that poetic license more than a fact.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;COVID has never been the cause of death. It has exacerbated other issues within the people who have died, but they did not die of COVID. COVID is not the same as Pneumonia. Pneumonia can kill you just fine on it's own, COVID can not, Pneumonia with COVID makes it more lethal.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;99% of the deaths from COVID, as reported, were elderly or had another factor. There is no way to know that they wouldn't have passed away at the same time or soon after if COVID wasn't involved. And unrelated to this entry it is sad and pathetic that when an elder died soon after getting the vaccine it was written off as "Unrelated and due to old age", but if it had happened a week prior to being vaccinated they would have written "Cause of death COVID."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Every single dataset we have for how many infected from COVID is at the very least suspect. If you consider the date the WHO published that the PCR test wasn't done correctly due to to many cycles creating false positives then basically all the numbers given prior to that time is incorrect. That includes those that died, those that lived, and asymptomatic.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"Asymptomatic" is a marketing term, and an aberration. There is no proof that they even exist (see faulty PCR tests), and the idea of someone infected but doesn't show any signs at all (if ever), and can transmit it by breathing the same air as other is a Hollywood scenario.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Now for the "Evil" part.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I refuse to roll myself into a ball and stop living just for others to live.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And expecting a majority of the world's population to do so is evil and cruel.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You cannot stop death, just as you cannot stop time.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You cannot save everyone, and the idea to even try is foolish.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You might try to tell me "If you got vaccinated you'd protect yourself and others." Well, the Delta variant seems to be proving contrary to that argument.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"But booster shots!" Okay that covers Delta, but them we get the "Epsilon variant."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"Another booster shot!" What? Are we going to go through the whole Greek alphabet before we start wondering if this might be futile?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And what happens if COVID mutates, or another superbug appears, due to these "solutions" the same way certain bacteria has been getting stronger due to overuse of antibiotics?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;To be clear, when I write "You" I am not talking about the OP or the reader.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Now, if you are okay with the idea of "Rolling yourself into a ball" every time some new scary super disease shows up then you need to build your "Climate controlled and sterile safe" domes and live in them. Don't worry I won't come knocking, and I'll probably get as far away as possible since all the waste produced inside said dome will more than likely be dumped right outside its front door.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I want to live on this Earth fully.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I want its risks and its rewards.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I want my grandkids to grow up seeing other peoples faces, and not cowering every time some half assed easily digestible "plague" shows up on TV.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If that means millions of people will die so that homo sapiens sapiens can continue living, so be it.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And if tomorrow I die, or someone in my family dies, or even someone close dies, it probably wasn't COVID but I'm sure they'll write it on the death certificate as such.</p>

        <p>You can live safely, or you can live.</p>
<p>They keep saying the non-maskers and unvaxed are at the most risk of dying.  It's the masked and vaxed who are hit hardest.  Yet, they still believe the MSM and the shill "experts".</p>
<p>Historically, the people who aren't as affected by a plague, because the live healthier, are blamed for the plague.  Witches, Jews, anti-maskers, different names for scapegoats.</p>

        <p>Not arguing, clarifying.</p>
<p>Witches generally lived outside of the community they were closest to, had knowledge of plants that could cure and soothe, since they were alone or in a very small group they did everything and had no problems with "getting their hands dirty." Most of their knowledge and traditions were handed down mother to daughter or Witch to apprentice.</p>
<p>Jews and Romani had/have strict rules (Laws even) about "cleanliness", how to act/react to certain things, and how to handle certain situations that were handed down from generation to generation.</p>
<p>When things got bad those groups seemed to be immune, so the general populace thought they had made a deal with the Devil to avoid getting sick.</p>
<p>Personally I wouldn't consider us anti-maskers and anti-COVAX the same as those i wrote about above, but the similarities are damned close.</p>

        <p>You're right.  The comparisons aren't 100%, but they were the best I could think of.  There's a recurring theme.  Whenever a doomer gets sick, it's always the fault of someone who didn't follow the rules.  They never consider that maybe the precautions don't actually work.  Add to it this myth that people like is are all somehow carrying the virus, but we're immune to it.</p>
<p>It's all an expression of modern people always wanting to blame someone else for their misfortunes.  It's never their fault or just bad luck.  It's some "selfish" person who isn't sacrificing everything for the "greater good".  Never mind the person complaining has sacrificed nothing.  They can't be bothered with facts.</p>

<p>I also like how you talked to fearmongered blind people with the right counter, stating their will to "not let anyone die of covid" is bullshit.</p>
<p>The very same bullshit that's served by the corrupted elite; corrupted elite really doesn't care about life or death of the crowd they just wanted control and power. I'm saving this thread for my own arguments later, my father and some friends have got real mad that I won't vaccinate.</p>

        <p>Given enough time and motivation people like your father will always find a paper debunking this or that. Unfortunately it would take something horrible happening to them or someone very close to them to have a chance of shocking them to reconsider their position.</p>
<p>And I always find it disturbing when a male (I am male) tries to argue anything when it comes to women, fertility, and reproduction. Even if anecdotal there is enough first hand information of healthy women losing their unborn child shortly after getting injected, and there are doctors talking about how the spiked proteins from the injections are concentrating in the ovaries.</p>
<p><strong>Entering dangerous waters I do not care to argue further afterwards:</strong></p>
<p>It's a bugaboo of mine. After "squirting their DNA" men have zero to do with the the gestation of growing a human being, and as such should have zero input on anything to do with women's fertility or sexual organs (doctors in that field are the exception). After the child is born it becomes a different conversation.</p>
