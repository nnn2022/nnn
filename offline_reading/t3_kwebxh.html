    <strong>Rutte and De Jonge says 3 Weeks extra lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>Yesterday,  Rutte and De Jonge told the public we're gonna have 3 extra weeks of lockdown in their speech conference. </p>
<p>Rutte and De Jonge says it's because a English variant has been mutated, Is that true is there a mutated english version? because I don't believe that bs at all.</p>
<p>How did they come up with that lie?</p></p>

        <p>Yes, they claim there is an English mutation of the virus. What they say is that it's less dangerous, but can be spread more easily.</p>
<p>1 + 1 = 2</p>
<p>To sum it up:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Covid-19 isn't that dangerous. Some people get ill, a very small amount of people die from it, mostly elderly people. (Of course, this isn't anything like the flu... at all...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most people survive C-19: after a couple of days they're better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, since we're dealing with a 'killer-virus' here, everyone should be tested in order to know one has the virus or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So people do the tests. The outcome: more negatives than positives. (One of the reasons they only show 'xxxx new infections' which doesn't say anything. How many have they tested? 25k? 100k?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So they needed more positive tests. How to do that? Easy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just count all negative tests and rename them to 'UK mutation'. Negative tests means no symptoms, which describes the UK variant: you're not sick, but we're calling it covid-19-UK anyway.</p>
<p>TLDR: The UK variant = being tested negative on C-19. After all, the UK variant = less dangerous. And it's spreading more, which makes sense, because more and more people test negative on C-19.</p>
