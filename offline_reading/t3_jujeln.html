    <strong>Some Simple Numbers</strong>
    <p><p>The first thing to remember is the 2018 US life expectancy as determined by the CDC: 78.7 years</p>
<p>The second thing to remember is the 2018 US mortality rate as determined by the CDC: 
8.678 deaths/1,000</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm">source</a></p>
<p>For the next part I‚Äôm going to do some math with the numbers from the first chart in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">this</a> CDC document.</p>
<p>The first thing I‚Äôm going to do is estimate the median age of death of those that have died with this covid. Since there are 223,984 total deaths of people with covid, we can determine that if the ages were listed in increasing order, the number at the 111,992‚Äônd position would be the median number. Adding the death totals from ages 0-74 we get 94,972. The next age group (75-84) includes 59,760 deaths with covid. Since 
94,962 &lt; 111,992 &lt; 94,962 + 59,760 we know that the median age of death of people with covid must fall within the 75-84 age range.</p>
<p>But we can get a more accurate estimate than that! If we take our median death index: 111,992, and subtract the total number of deaths from ages 0-74: 94,972, we get a remainder of 17,020. This means that the 17,020‚Äôth youngest death within the 75-84 age range is our median death. We can determine the percentile at which this occurs by dividing 17,020 by the total number of deaths in that range: 59,760. This comes out to be 28.5%. If we assume an even distribution of age of death within the 75-84 range we can now conclude that the median age of death of those with covid is 77.85 years old. Furthermore, since it is likely that age of death within the 75-84 range is actually skewed towards the upper end (since older people within the range are more likely to die) rather than an even distribution, it is very likely that the median age of death of those with covid is actually higher than 77.85. </p>
<p>Now remember the 2018 US life expectancy of 78.7. This means that people in the US with covid aren‚Äôt dying any younger than they would be expected to die in a normal year!</p>
<p>‚ÄúOkay, so people aren‚Äôt dying younger, but there‚Äôs still more of them dying!‚Äù Is, I‚Äôm sure, the next argument that the sheep will make.</p>
<p>If we go back to our chart we can see that there have been 2,452,180 total deaths (all causes) in the US through the week ending in 11/7 (at the time of writing this post). This is the 44th week of the year. By setting up a ratio 2,452,180/44 = X/52 we can estimate the total number of deaths by years end (X). In this case X = 2,898,031. By dividing 2,898,031 by the entire population: 328,239,523, we can determine the mortality rate in 2020 to be 0.00829 or 
8.829 deaths/1,000.</p>
<p>This is only slightly higher than the 2018 mortality rate of 8.678 and it is actually lower than the (pre-covid) US projected 2020 mortality of 8.880 deaths/1,000!* (this small increase in death rate has been a yearly trend since 1990 due primarily to increased obesity &amp; heart disease)</p>
<p>*<a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate">source</a></p>
<p>So, we now know that not only are people with covid expected to live just as long as those without it, but additionally that mortality in the US has actually decreased vs pre covid expectations for 2020! It‚Äôs almost as if people are dying from the same things they have always been dying from and some of those deaths are just being listed as covid. Which, if you look at the 3rd chart in the CDC document which covers comorbidity, you can see that this actually does seem to be the case ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>I simply do not understand how someone can see these numbers and still think that there is a dangerous pandemic sweeping through this country.</p></p>

        <p>Very legit, I agree with every bit of your analysis. Real problem, covid-19 isn't a real problem. They are just using it to control everyone. The plan meets somewhere in the middle between the green new deal and the world economic forum and it's not a conspiracy when they literally lay it out for everyone to see beforehand. The last piece required was getting Trump out of office and it's looking like a done deal at this point. The next few years will be filled with more lockdowns and restrictions to bring as many people to the absolute desperation required to turn a free country to socialism. Socialism requires you to need the government.</p>

        <p>/u/h3yis4h0rces, I have a confession to make. I‚Äôm a serial killer who likes to kill small children. Okay, I know that sounds bad but you‚Äôve given me some hope. You see for every kid I kill I also kill two octogenarians, to sort of even things out.</p>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs do some math. I‚Äôve killed 3,000 people this year in total. Of those, 1,000 were in the 5‚Äì10 age range and the other 2,000 were in the 80‚Äì89 age range. So the median age of people I killed was between 80 and 89. I didn‚Äôt really keep track, but let‚Äôs assume the ages of the people I killed were uniformly distributed in the 80‚Äì89 age range. That means the median age of people I killed is <em>81.7</em>! Now as we all know, the average life expectancy in the US as determined by the CDC in the year 2018 was 78.7 years. So on average, the people I killed lived <em>more than 2.5 years longer than they would have otherwise and I have done nothing wrong!</em></p>
<p>I desperately need your help explaining this to the court. Please respond quickly, my trial starts in two hours!</p>
<p>Edit: Clarified my predilections at /u/h3yis4h0rces‚Äô suggestion.</p>

        <p>Maybe, since 2/3 of your victims are 80+, you should stop lying and say that you primarily kill elderly people ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
