        <p>Lol I was in the covid vaccine side effects fb group and got blocked by a mod. Why? Well someone shared that their vaccinated sister didn’t want to go near them bc they didn’t want the vaccine. Then I shared a Reddit post a teacher posted last night that said they got their last shot in February but just tested positive today and their students can go maskless (not sure I believe masks work). Then the mod told me the vaccines are 90-95% effective and if the student had a mask on near the teacher they would have been “DOUBLY protected 😊” and I was like ummm even the vaccine makers have said a million times that the vaccines only prevent covid hospitalizations and death (which isn’t even 100% true obviously) and then I was instantly blocked. Deleted my fb then bc I can’t take the censorship. Couldn’t before but I found the group to be interesting. You don’t need a fb to read the comments but I logged in to participate. </p>
<p>My dad said a coworker was doing a job at a doctors house. Dr asked if they had been vaccinated and his coworker said “hell no. Have you?” And the doctor said “hell no” and said you’re better off taking care of yourself. </p>
<p>He also told me another coworker was at the doctor and their doctor hadn’t worn a mask this whole time. We live in liberal Massachusetts, mind you!! And this doctor wasn’t getting or recommending the vaccine. They told him they prescribed HQC (or whatever it is lol) if their patients had covid. </p>
<p>Then there’s the NP my family knows who won’t get it because she wants kids. And then my friend’s nurse mom who won’t get it. And my sister’s best friend who works in DNA sequencing and is very smart and has worked in cancer research who won’t get it. And my friend who got the vaccine and doesn’t want kids who told me one of her friend’s doctors suggested not getting it bc her friend does want more kids. So some healthcare professionals are speaking out against it. I’m sure many are afraid of being “canceled” if they tell how they really feel to the wrong person though...</p>
<p>My own grandparents got the vaccines and I’m sort of glad because I did worry about covid hurting them because of their age and luckily they’ve been fine so far and got the vaccines in like January. I think it was worth the risk for them but I think even people their age need to weigh the risks because of all the deaths surrounding the vaccines in nursing homes. I’m still nervous around them because I know the vaccines aren’t that effective but I think they’re happy I’m
Not as nervous to hug them. The media just made me really scared for elderly people if they got covid. I know that could be silly but I think it’s harmless in most of the population but a bit scary in the elderly. My friend’s gramma fell last spring and the hospital did a covid test just bc she was there and it was positive but she never had any covid symptoms. And she’s 84. So idk... the whole thing is crazy. But I do get nervous for my elderly family. Idk how nervous I should be but I just can’t help it. I don’t think people my age (30) or kids really should be worried about covid
Though.., they’re more likely to die from many other things the media doesn’t want us to panic about. </p>
<p>Just sharing!</p>

        <p>Thanks for trying to help her. Honestly, that line about her making fun of people doing research disgusted me. I bet she won't even take any of the shots, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ncima5/a_visual_for_anyone_who_says_the_experimental/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>let's pray that she never does</strong></a>, or anyone for that matter.</p>
