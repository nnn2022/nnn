    <p><p>&rt;But hey, might as well piss on the graves of the 578 Saskatchewan people who have died from this disease. </p>
<p>578/1174000</p>
<p>0.05% of the population.</p>
<p>99.95% survival rate for <strong>all</strong> ages. </p>
<p>Here's death data from 2007.</p>
<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20190701053303/https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/84-215-x/2010001/tbl/t021-eng.htm</p>
<p>9000 people died in total.</p>
<p>2271 from Malignant neoplasms.</p>
<p>2115 from heart disease.</p>
<p>595 from Cerebrovascular diseases.</p>
<p>Now here's the funny bit, If this was an actual pandemic and the virus wasn't killing those at risk, it would be #4. However, since it's killing those who should have been recorded as a heart disease death, or similar, those numbers will shrink. While this will inflate the WuFlu's death number, it'll keep the overall deaths at near the same level.</p>
<p>So come back to me when you want to lockdown and wear muzzles in order to prevent people from overeating, a cause of heart disease, and I might take you seriously. But right now, you're freaking out over nothing. Oh, and I'm assuming your number is from 2020 until today, so it's not 578, it's 2/3rd of that, 2020-2021, not 2020- July 2021. Which is 385.</p>
<p>Which puts chronic lower respiratory diseases (414), and <strong>accidents</strong> (422) as more common causes of death.</p>
<p>Even diabetes kills 322 Saskatchewan residents a year. Our average flu numbers are 249. </p>
<p>So it's not even twice as deadly as the flu. And you seem to think it's the worst thing to ever hit us.</p></p>
