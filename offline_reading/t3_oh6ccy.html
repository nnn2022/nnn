    <strong>Thoughts on vax shedding?</strong>
    <p><p>Do you all believe that the spike protein from the c*vid vax can be shed through saliva/air? Or is this another method of fear mongering? I'm not getting the vax, but I do have to be around people who got it. I just want to hear your thoughts bc I keep seeing conflicting opinions about this.</p></p>

        <p>It would make sense that shedding would occur.  It occurs with viral infection and the mRNA vaccines kind of mimic that.  However, I do not believe that this would cause any real problems to somebody who came into contact with that shedding. Heck, if anything, it might trigger an immune response again it.</p>

        <p>Sooooo…. This might be TMI, but ya I believe the saliva part for sure. I happened to share a drink with a friend who’s gotten the shot (realised my mistake the instant I swallowed my sip) and two days later I passed two clots from my uterus. Let me mention that I have a hormonal IUD and haven’t had a period in over 6 years, so this was really strange for me. </p>
<p>Prior to this, I noticed after seeing my doctor who examined a small lump on my leg that I had uterine cramps for a few days following. She’s also had the jab… so it makes me think that there’s something with skin-to-skin contact, as well. </p>
<p>But take this all with a grain of salt, as it’s simply anecdotal.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry that happened to you, I hope you're fine. I've been taking elderberry and echinacea supplements to help my immune system. I'm around vaxed people a few times a week, and I feel okay but I've heard many stories similar to yours. It could be a placebo thing but the supplements help, I also exercise everyday. Someone on here recommended pine needle tea as well, I'm gonna try that soon. </p>
<p>Similar to you, a few weeks ago, I let a friend take a sip of my drink at a party and she told me she was "fully vaxed" later that night :/ That happened right after my period was over and I didn't get any more bleeding. I'm supposed to get it again in a few days, so I'm praying that it's normal. I don't want to avoid people and be a hermit, but I also want to be careful. </p>
<p>Someone also linked me this "protection guide" for people who got the shot, also has info on shedding: https://detoxandreplenish.me/product/c-shot-protection/ </p>
<p>I downloaded it, but idk how true everything is so use discernment when reading it. Stress can also cause irregular periods and other health problems, so try not to get too stressed. I'll pray for all of us.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I hear you. I’m trying not to stress over it. Bought some pine needle tea and drink a cup a few times a week. Not sure if it does anything but it tastes good haha</p>
<p>Also taking quercetin, vit d, vit c, and neem capsules. Picked up some chaga tea as well as that’s supposed to help too. </p>
<p>Hope everything goes well for you!</p>

        <p>My wife and sister in law both had their cycles get super messed up soon after members of our family that we are around constantly were vaccinated. Not sure how the whole spike protein thing works but they are both convinced that the extreme irregularity of cycle timing is from shedding. I have not noticed anything out of the ordinary with myself though.</p>

        <p>I have been searching for this. I hope folks will finally listen to me. I’m 31F. For my whole life I’ve had regular 28 day periods no issues</p>
<p>After staying with my bf parents post their vaccine I had 3 periods in 2 months</p>
<p>After spending more time with them I developed an ovarian cyst that ruptured for the first time in my life</p>
<p>It happened a second time a month later while I was staying at their house</p>
<p>It happened a third time after staying with my dad post his vaccine, spent a 2 hour car ride with him to a hiking spot- half way up the mountain it ruptured</p>
<p>Maybe this is all coincidence .. I have not gotten the vaccine.. But this has been the weirdest 6 months of my life and maybe coincidence it lined up with me spending time around vaccinated folks idk</p>

        <p>I hear pine needle tea is helpful. I was worried for a bit I'll admit. I personally had to pray on this one. I came up with "What would Jesus do?". I believe Jesus would hug a "vaccinated" person. I didn't for one day live in fear of "Covid" and I won't through this!</p>

        <p>Doesn’t gene therapy interact with DNA in the nucleus of the cell, whereas the mRNA vaccines supposedly do not? Nothing on that gene therapy network page references covid vaccines or viral inoculation at all.</p>

<p>Here ya go.... The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy disagree with you. I'm sure you're more qualified than them. If CNN had called it gene therapy, you may have looked into it.....probably not though.

        <p>I appreciate that, I’m only asking/discussing so that I can learn and understand, I didn’t mean to be combative. </p>
<p>On that site, the video explaining “how mRNA vaccines work” seemed more propaganda-like, or at least too simplistic an explanation to answer my question. But I was able to find <a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/news-views-3-questions-you-will-get-about-new-mrna-vaccines">this page</a> (I have no way of vetting any of this info) that says the mRNA is active in the cytoplasm and is unable to penetrate the nucleus. If that’s true, then it isn’t altering our genes. </p>
<p>I guess that doesn’t mean that OP wouldn’t get some secondhand spike protein, though. I don’t know much about these things, is the main concern that basically even if someone isn’t vaccinated, they will receive the same material into their bodies just from being around someone who is?</p>

        <p>So it's hard for me to believe anything that is being said about the "vax" which is actually gene therapy. But reverse transcription just like "Covid".</p>

        <p>Another way....</p>
<p>"So, the only way the COVID-19 vaccine mRNA might enter your DNA is if you were unlucky enough to be infected at precisely the same time with HIV, or another kind of retrovirus, and this virus was active for the few short hours the vaccine mRNA was present in your cells. The chances of this happening are vanishingly small."</p>
