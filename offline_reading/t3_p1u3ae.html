    <strong>Am i going crazy?</strong>
    <p><p>So let me get this straight..... 
According to the folks pressing me and others to get a jab, if you have the vax, you will be still able to get and pass on the ‚ÄòRona, but ‚Äúthe symptoms will be less severe ‚Äú ?</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt watch much news, and i live in a pretty remote place and haven‚Äôt cared much, but this is the basic info as I understand. Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.</p>
<p>Now, if that is correct, and the reason for getting the jab is so we can get back to normal, and the people who have gotten the shot are already being told they can travel freely and do what they want, then aren‚Äôt they ‚Äúsuper spreaders‚Äù? </p>
<p>Their head honcho said masks don‚Äôt really work anyway. 
Not that i care, I‚Äôd rather everyone wear a mask than see alot of ugly expressions from folks anyway, people are too fucked to be happy and pleasant anyway. 
They travel and spread and blame the unvaxxed... they have a false sense of security and a false sense of Righteousness and are on the warpath. </p>
<p>Or I‚Äôm seeing this all wrong? Really just wondering. I don‚Äôt want the shot, i don‚Äôt take any pharmaceutical drugs at all in my life. Vitamins, cannabis, good fresh food and a healthier than average lifestyle has done me great.</p></p>

        <p>It‚Äôs all made up science/ lies to make the drug companies money. A face mask doesn‚Äôt work as they are hardly going to stop particles from leaving them and they give you chest infections, like in the Spanish flu days. Stay away from the mainstream media as they all sell the same lies in each country/different channels, word for word. Your better getting your vitamin D levels, Zinc and vitamin c levels up. It‚Äôs more protection than the jab and you can still get covid after having it. Covid is just a bad flu but I‚Äôve had both and the flu was worse.</p>

        <p>You're not wrong. </p>
<p>At this point pretty much everything that happens will be the fault of the unvaccinated in their minds. I keep asking what the heck are we going to do about the billions of people in the world who are not vaccinated? Are we going to shut down their borders, put sanctions on them, nuke them? No one will answer this question with anything other than, "get the vaccine". People refuse to think.</p>

        <p>You are not going crazy. The vaccine does not stop infection, it does not stop viral replication, it does not stop transmission. Those who are double vaccinated, and according to Israel even triple vaccinated, get infected with the virus just the same as anybody not vaccinated.</p>
<p>The vaccine was supposed to prevent infection and when that failed they said it was to prevent serious illness and transmission and when that failed they said it was to prevent serious illness and now we are seeing a lot of double vaccinated people suffering from very serious illness.</p>
<p>There is a very serious concern of antibody dependent enhancement which appears to have already started some people and there is also the concern that the shift in immune profile in people who are vaccinated causes illnesses that the body has kept at bay to fully emerge such as herpes, mono, shingles, hiv, and cancers.</p>
<p>Many doctor and nurse whistleblowers are stating that hospitals are actually filled with vaccinated patients who are suffering from side effects or severe covid which might be the ADE. </p>
<p>Any vaccinated person could be a super spreader because they are getting more leeway into where they can spread and their symptoms can sometimes be less so they don't even know they are spreading.</p>

        <p>"But at least the symptoms are less severe" is almost certainly a distortion of the truth. In my first-hand experience, the vaccinated people I know are having worse symptoms from the "Delta Variant" than the unvaccinated. (For us it was like a common cold that passed in a few days.)</p>
<p>The reason symptoms are less severe is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people susceptible to death from Covid have already died.</li>
<li>Viruses generally evolve to be more contagious but less lethal. (Simple evolution -- a virus that kills the host does a poor job of spreading.)</li>
</ul>
