    <strong>Oregon hell</strong>
    <p><p>So I moved to beaverton oregon in August because we wanted a better quality of life. I came.from las vegas which had grown to become a cali hell so wherever Californians go they destroy idk why but that's what it is. So stupidly we had the idea it will be ok as I'm was not very right learning at the time but i was getting there. Living here has been interesting to say the least we went to Portland once and it was fucked up homeless people fucking on the train and also smoking Crack with zero response with absolutely zero security after confronting him because my kid was there I has a fat thing approach me telling me to check my privilege mind you everybody involved was white. Mine you living in vegas there were plenty of gay,Trans, and homeless people everywhere so it was not so bad and im use to it but the people here are totally different in the way I don't like. I've never been to a whiter place in my life vegas is plenty diverse but here oh no not at all. People wear 2 masks and when I don't I have had 6 different times people in cars gave yelled something whole.i drive alone to work about im a pos for not wearing 2.masks yet people here are either super skinny and exercise friendly or obese and nasty so it's kinda funny to see people telling me about risk of health while most are going to have major issues due to being massively overweight and wearing 2 masks. I'm just shocked of how white and ignorant most people are when i have asked simple questions im a nazi who loves trump when I just asked you believe in this shit? I have asthma and im a kitchen manager with a very very open kitchen so any time I need to take a breath people sit and wait.to say something even tho these people are jammed packed in a tiny tent inches from one another yet me being 10 plus feet away alone im a nazi so needless to say I'm moving in August to Tennessee to get away from this weird white liberal hell.</p></p>

        <p>They truly do Vegas in the 90s was awesome then all these scumbags came and ruined it with their way if thinking gangs and voting. So it's funny they leave cause they can't afford to live there then they do it again once they move.</p>

        <p>In that case, come on down. Of course republicans are by no means perfect, but at least they’re not actively and openly trying to usher in authoritarian socialism. </p>
<p>You’ll find that life is completely normal here in most places, especially outside of Nashville. In my town you hardly see a mask and most businesses have been operating normally the entire time. At my work we regularly have hundreds of people in the building without a single mask. You’d never know anything was going on if you didn’t read the news.</p>

        <p>Lived in Tigard just outside of Portland from 2008 to 2016.</p>
<p>At first it was pretty rad. Great restaurants, great breweries. Was a little weird, but what major city isnt.</p>
<p>Worked in downtown Portland. Year after year witnessed it get worse as well as the Police being supported less and less. In 2016 saw the start of Antifa there and new I had bail.</p>
<p>Im just glad I moved to a red State instead of where I was considering, Seattle. They have been infected with the same disease there too.</p>

        <p>I just escaped Portland a month ago. I was living downtown.</p>
<p>It is really a shame because Oregon is a beautiful place. The coast, the mountains, the waterfalls, the forests. Gorgeous.</p>
<p>I kind of hope it rebounds but I am starting to come to terms with the fact that Portland is really unrecognizable and if it does recover it will take years.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Miami is also beautiful, and there are things to do and people are friendlier than in the PNW.</p>
