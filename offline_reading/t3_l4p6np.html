    <strong>Government authoritarianism &amp; tyranny is FAR more damaging to the populace than COVID19 could ever enact.</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, we are the government and we will keep you safe. Free I hear you say? No, don't be ridiculous citizen, you pay with your liberty! What a deal I hear you say?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Shut your business</li>
<li>Don't see your friends and family</li>
<li>Wear your mask</li>
<li>Do not dissent</li>
<li>Do not question the narrative</li>
<li>Take this vaccine</li>
</ul>
<p>In return, we will pay your way whilst you sit at home on furlough. Hey, I forgot to mention. You're now reliant on us, the government! Working for yourself? Forget that! Earning your own bread? Forget that, we need to keep you safe! We are in control of your destiny now!</p>
<p>When will your liberty be returned in full? Well, when we say so. When could that be? When we get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Hey Mr Government, you said when the vaccine had been distributed we could return to normal? Hey citizen, I'm just fucking with ya!</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>The cure cannot be worse than the disease. Government authoritarianism and tyranny is FAR more damaging to the populace than COVID19 could ever enact.</p>
<p>Saving those from COVID comes at a cost of your liberty.</p>
<p>Good luck getting that back in full once (if) this crisis ends.</p></p>
