    <strong>1/3 of the 1st graders in my school district had to attend summer school this year.</strong>
    <p><p>Saw a teacher today while out shopping and just found out that 42 out of about 120ish first graders needed to attend summer school this year. Not sure what the numbers were in previous years were, but this seems way too high.</p>
<p>She also told me they opened the school cafeteria up for the students attending summer school and a lot of them didn't know what to do. They had to tell the kids it was okay to take the milk, food, trays and cutlery. During the school year, the kids were eating breakfast and lunch in their classrooms and the teachers would pass out the food.</p>
<p>On a happier note, she told me they got rid of all the distance markers in the hallways and other places.</p></p>

        <p>Well, my mum is the Head Teacher's assistant (high school) and she told me that there are 135 students who have 1-3 negative final marks. Last year this number was 50, and before covid about 30, if I recall correctly.</p>
