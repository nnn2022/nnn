    <strong>How did we get to the point where almost 100,000 Redditors are okay with a police state?</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleDieInside/comments/il4wd2/covid_denier_dies_inside_while_being_arrested_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">I‚Äôm dumbfounded as to how this post has almost 100k upvotes.</a> The doublethink required to support the BLM protests and also support the arrest of someone for planning an anti-lockdown protest on Facebook is literally right out of 1984. Have we gotten to a point where a majority of people support what is essentially thought police? I‚Äôm really hoping that this is just an internet bubble on Reddit and not what the actual majority of people think- but this still has me scared. If I was an Australian I would be out in the streets protesting this right now. We cannot let our basic rights to freedom of speech &amp; peaceful assembly be taken away. I fear that this kind of authoritarianism will spread to other countries the longer that COVID lockdowns go on.</p></p>

        <p>I mean, yeah? It's that simple. Feels like people on here are confused on this fact when it's really not that complicated. People are stupid and hypocritical, once you accept that, the rest of these reactions makes much more sense.</p>

        <p>That's always been the danger with authoritarianism. Most people think they're right and think that the people enforcing their beliefs are wholly good, and, even if they aren't, what they're doing is for the greater good. </p>
<p>That's a reason that civil society requires people to compromise which fewer and fewer people on both sides are willing to do. And that leads to authoritarianism and sectarianism. There's a reason people used to say,  "I may disagree with what you say, but I'll defend your right to say it with my life." Somewhere that was lost to newer generations. Police states always start policing language and expression.</p>

        <p>Fareed Zakaria (yes I know not everyone is a fan) wrote an interesting book on this topic called "The Future of Freedom". Whole angle of it was how off-the-rails democracy can go, largely due to the tyranny of the masses, without a well thought-out constitution. The tl;dr of it is that democracy does not equal liberty without constitutional bulwarks.</p>

        <p>Looks interesting...adding it to my future list. I will say that it's interesting that in the book description, he describes "liberal democracy" as prone to such failings. Zakaria argued that having a strong constitution was what separated liberal democracies from illiberal democracies, and having the former would help prevent (or at least slow) the descent. I wonder if it's a semantically different use of the term "liberal" (e.g. the generic US politics definition vs the classical one), i.e. what would that author consider an "illiberal democracy". But definitely looks worthy of reading.</p>

        <p>I would say that it was trained out of several generations of kids when schools taught them that questioning authority figures, even when said authority figure is dead wrong, is a disciplinary violation and is met with swift punishment. I still remember when my fifth grade teacher wrote "Openly challenges teacher" on my report card, next to a grade of "unsatisfactory" for behavior.</p>

        <p>Got nothing to do with politics. Given the appropriate circumstances almost everyone would go on a rampage. It's taken countless generations of constant social programming to get to the point where violence is no longer an ordinary part of daily life. That savagery is part of our nature. It had to be or we wouldn't survive. This violence is bad idea is a very recent invention.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Guys used to go out every Friday and Saturday night to the bars with their bros and knock the shit out of random people for no real reason. If people had a dispute of any nature it would escalate to blows more often than not. A century or two ago if a man talked shit about your puffy powdered wig or your lace cravat you'd be a pariah to your whole community if you didn't challenge him to a duel with pistols. Parents would beat their children, children would beat other children, men would beat women, women would beat animals, kids used to have fun by taking a bunch of firecrackers to the pond and shoving them up frogs' asses and drown squirrels in buckets. Go ask your father, it was what kids did back in the 50s and 60s.  And none of it had a point, it didn't have a higher purpose, people were just tougher and more direct before all the hormones in the food and the propaganda on the schools and television made them soft. You know that 1980s movie trope where two guys are into the same chick and she says you two fight and the winner gets to take me on a date? It has a basis in reality, it's how things used to be, two guys fight, the winner fucks the prom queen, the loser goes home to jerk off. I don't know what kids these days do when both of them are into the same chick, probably act like cucks and share her.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The point is this idea that violence is unusual and it takes a sick mind to enjoy it is a socially invented concept.</p>

        <p>This is basically everyone, you're more likely to hold the opposition to stricter ideals than the side that you agree with. This issue is exasperated when the media becomes one sided and pushes radical ideologies. There is always an equal &amp; opposite reaction and it brings out the worst in both parties so that the mentality of the public is not in a rational place. </p>
<p>Look at the Kyle Rittenhouse situation, any rational person would see that there is blame on all sides. It starts with the media for instigating violence, it continues with Donald Trump's lack of empathy which gives credence to violent riots, moving to a conservative militia that should have never been there in the first place, and finally the radicalized marxists who take advantage of the chaos. </p>
<p>It's our government's job to protect our cities from violence, no one should have been in Kenosha WI that evening, but people were there. We have two sides that believe that their presence is necessary and the divisiveness prevents either from recognizing the hypocrisy on their own side.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree, Trump has the attitude of almost every millionaire I've ever met. These are results focused people who don't care about anything other than the task at hand. It's that overall attitude that pushes people the wrong way when they disagree. </p>
<p>I respect Trump for staying genuine and true to himself, and he's too far down that road to change anything.</p>

        <p>The phrase "COVID denier" really grinds my fucking gears.  Nobody is saying the virus doesn't exist (well okay, maybe <em>some</em> are, but those people are loony tunes).  We're just saying that it may not be <em>as dangerous</em> as we've been led to believe, and that the prevention/mitigation efforts are more extreme than they need to be.  Why does that line of thinking get dismissed as "HURR DURR COVID DENIER"???</p>

        <p>Exactly the point.</p>
<p>Expressing the opinion (and backing it up with quite a bit of data from medical professionals and virologists, to boot!) that the danger from this virus may just be blown out of proportion and certainly the need for a "new normal" police state is = you're an evil, selfish granny killer.</p>

        <p>Hegelian dialectic. It's a CIA discourse control tool.  you create a dichotomy of two options only but allow rabid debate but zero nuance outside the 2 positions.</p>
<p>So we now are at the only position this train of thought could lead down with a virus which is it does or does not exist.  because it can not be exactly bad or good it must occupy some other extreme position of dichotomy; which is the ludicrous idea that it does or does not even exist.</p>

        <p>Hi, "Nobody is saying the virus doesn't exist (well okay, maybe some are, but those people are loony tunes)."</p>
<p>Oh, maybe it's not such a loony position after all, judging by these curious information : </p>

        <p>Bots, the Reddit hivemind, and unproductive slimebags who have nothing going on for themselves. Some subs (like r/justiceserved which openly cheered for a woman getting choked for not wearing a mask) have a long history of a psychopathic userbase. This is the same site that had subs like watchpeopledie. If it wasn‚Äôt banned-I‚Äôd wager at LEAST 40% of the users here would be on the jailbait sub right now as they ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù quarantine. These are pathetic people. Their ‚Äúmoral judgements‚Äù isn‚Äôt worth the cell phone data I use to browse their subreddit‚Äôs shitty opinions (cause most of them rather than have minds of their own are more like little borgs that think according to the agenda of their subreddit).</p>

        <p>When I was younger it felt like Nazi Germany was a long time ago, and that it couldn't happen again.  But it wasn't really that long ago, only 75-80 years.  The Germans may have been defeated in the war, but their ideals most likely didn't die.  It is not surprising to me anymore that these type of people exist.</p>

        <p>It's not as though he's the only one.  Trump's campaign has literally said "No one will be safe in Joe Biden's America."  Their biggest thing right now is showing images and footage from riots happening now, some of which <em>aren't even in America</em>, and saying this is what will happen if Biden is elected.</p>
<p>Edit: Downvote if you want, but you can't really deny that both sides are happily playing on people's fears right now.  This isn't whataboutism or enlightened centrism.  It's just an acknowledgement of a shitty time.</p>

        <p>I see your point (and I did not downvote you btw because I think you‚Äôre correct), but at the same time, I think we have to acknowledge that Trump voters/supporters actually are in more danger for openly supporting him than Biden voters/supporters. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm not omniscient, but it seems like the volume of attacks on Trump supporters from the left is FAR higher AND more widely accepted than the attacks on Biden supporters from the right.</p>

        <p>I can't speak for everywhere, but in my city in Texas, there's open Trump support everywhere.  People have giant Trump flags, signs, and even wear their MAGA hats and face masks everywhere they go.

        <p>The youth of today, which is what Reddit, mainly, consists of are the most obedient generation in history. Conditioned by an education system to do as they are told and then honed by social media platforms to shout down any non-conforming view (which would be bullying in any sane universe - but there is a complete blind spot for mob rule on social media) and to scorn anyone who dare go against the grain. </p>
<p>I don't blame them. They've been programmed. The right jokes about NPCs on the left, but this has gone beyond a left-right divide, it really is NPCs vs the rest of us. They can't think for themselves. Their arguments always turn out the same; "I don't fink wearing masks can be dat bad and it might save a granny." With no evidence for their claims provided. </p>
<p>They celebrate anyone who is "canceled" (literally a clinical way of saying "has had their life ruined by bullies" so that they don't have to confront the consequences of their actions) and love authoritarianism as long as it's their brand on the box.</p>

<p>Thankfully we only need a small portion to win. Many of these people sway whatever way the wind takes them, very easily manipulated by those who would want to. A few can be convinced and illuminated, but honestly, most of them spend all day in front of a screen watching pop culture nonsense, they're NPCs that have to believe they matter.</p>

<p>No. No, I think they are pretty bad people, actually. Look at what these people have done. Hell, they are cheering on people opposed to masks who are getting injured, arrested, and even killed. No sympathy. Many of these people are also snitching on their neighbors, and partaking in acts of violence. I don't know, sounds like they are bad people to me.</p>
<p>Edit: Yep. Getting downvoted to oblivion over this already. It's like. Would you guys say that the people who took part in the Salem Witch Trials were "not necessarily bad people"? They killed others who were different, out of their ignorance and fear. Same with people who took part in the Holocaust. Again, they were ignorant, but they allowed that ignorance to breed acts against humanity. I find that there's no excuse for this, and these people are not "good deep down", they are monsters who use fear as a justification to perpetuate death and destruction.</p>

        <p>Yes, I agree. While we should not demonize people or turn them into cookie-cutter one-dimensional villains, I don't see why so many of us go out of our way to praise these people's goodness or their intentions. Their characters range from gravely deficient (in the case of the fearful) to malevolent (in the case of the snitches), and we shouldn't be ashamed to admit it.</p>

        <p>They are brainwashed sheep.  This is exactly what the powers that shouldn't be want.  They want people to enslave themselves.  The manipulate the masses through the media with constant barrages of fear, half truths, and outright lies.  They call people "deniers" and use "science" as a weapon, but don't actually follow what the science says.  This virus is the catalyst for everything 40+ years of "environmentalism" couldn't accomplish.  That's total top down government control enforced through violence under the guise of saving people from themselves.  </p>
<p>The parallels between the "solutions" to this virus and what as been proposed for saving the planet from global warming are many, and it's same people promoting it, and the same brainwashed fools falling for it while attempting to force it on everyone else.</p>

        <p>This. I have been saying that they literally accomplished in 4 months what they were trying to accomplish for 30 years and they did it without having to win any elections or pass any real legislation. It was a genius move on their part and has made me disgusted and angry at people who should have seen through this but instead just went along with it all. It's almost like a switch was pulled and they instantly went dumb after living their whole lives smarter than this.</p>

        <p>The parallels are there because the solution is always authoritarianism and redistributing more power from the individual to the ruling class (i.e. them). The only thing that changes are the excuses. Overpopulation, resource depletion, environmental degradation, crime, civil disorder, global warming, global cooling, economic boom and bust, dysgenics, racial degeneration, conspiracies by evil foreigners, and disease have all been offered as excuses, with the same sort of solution always offered every time.</p>

        <p>Because everyone wants to go along with the norm. They want to feel powerful by joining the larger team and being able to have more people to back them up when they dehumanise anti-lockdown people, and people who are against mandatory mask usage, calling them "selfish", "retard", "dumbass", "sociopath", "scumbag", "asshole", "Karen", "evil" and whatever else.</p>
<p>Unfortunately population's have a tendency to conform and go along with tyranny until it is too late and the Government and establishment has too much power. Just look at Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and even modern day China, whom many pro-lockdown people praise for handling the disease better than us "stupid westerners". I would have thought people would know better than to support the CCP after what happened to Hong Kong but I guess I was wrong.</p>

        <p>Redditors loving playing hero, as they get to live out their apocalypse and superhero fantasies from the movies, TV shows, video games and comics they see. Reddit's piss poor attempt to find the Boston Marathon bomber comes to mind when you think about this.  The MSM and social media has vastly inflated people's egos as they have given purpose and meaning to staying inside and doing nothing all day. Society would frown upon these people normally, but now that the media has made staying home into some kind of heroic act, its now the exact opposite. Society now frowns upon people who want to live their lives.</p>

        <p>It's generational, I grew up thinking each generation was more anti-authority than the previous one as that was my experience. Logically though, it can't always be like that or we would be in some kind of Sodom and Gomorrah by now.</p>
<p>We're swinging back to a strong respect rather than a disdain for authority. Personally, I'm blaming it on them taking the lead out of petrol.</p>

        <p>I'm a "millennial" (not sure if you are) but I felt my generation was much more pro-authoritarian than Gen-X and other past ones. I've seen it since I was a child, and saw that it got worse in the 2010s once many millennials began to enter positions of power.</p>

        <p>Meh. </p>
<p>Gonna get downvoted to oblivion here, but I feel like both extremes are bad to teach kids. Telling kids to go punch a bully into a bloody pulp (something people here keep saying we should do to pro-maskers...) isn't the answer, nor is running and hiding. Feels like people just go to one extreme, instead of finding a healthier balance, like teaching children how to ignore bullying or how to fight back without resorting to extreme violence. Martial arts has principles of this kind (there's a lot of spirituality to the art, it's not about how to injure or kill enemies), but obviously, not everyone enrolls themselves or their kids in these classes.</p>

        <p>The only thing worse than that was zero tolerance. If some kid was repeatedly bullying you no matter what else you tried, or even if they were physically assaulting you, you could not fight back. If you did, even if it was blatant self-defense, you would be punished the same as the bully. This plus the encouragement to run to the teacher created a bunch of passive aggressive informants who relied on The Authorities for everything. You'd think the experience of being punished for self defense would've made people anti-authoritarian. I know I hated it.</p>

        <p>&rt;or we would be in some kind of Sodom and Gomorrah by now</p>
<p>We aren't already? Sodomy is awfully popular nowadays. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+19&amp;version=NIV">If angels in the form of men came to one of our wonderfully progressive cities, would there be a lack of men wanting to collectively fuck them in the ass?</a> Don't we <em>celebrate</em> shit like that now?</p>
<p>Not only that:
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel+16%3A49-50&amp;version=NIV">"Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen."</a> Sounds like we're already there, if not worse. What sin <em>don't</em> we elevate? We openly disregard our parents and throw them in nursing homes, fuck anybody we want to at any time, consume food and entertainment in mindless excess, "follow our dreams" and do whatever we feel like with no sense of duty or self-sacrifice, throw the needy under the bus...</p>
<p>People in the past would have found us detestable. Even just the way we speak to our elders would have been detestable, let alone everything else. We're so mired in filth we barely notice the stench any more.</p>

<p>That is absolutely irrelevant to the conversation. There's no law against having thoughts. If someone expressed an intent to murder, similar to posting an intent to incite an illegal gathering, you could definitely raise that to the appropriate authorities. </p>
<p>Know the laws, it's important, because right now you are the answer to your username.</p>

        <p>Well according to you there is no need for a trial then, because she's already guilty. </p>
<p>How do you know all this? Did you see her making the specific post? Are you a witness?</p>
<p>The primer in Victoria <em>urged Victorians not to take part in protests.</em> </p>
<p><em>No matter what your postcode or purpose, protest is not safe, it's not smart, it's just not right</em>  </p>
<p>Isn't that an incitement against civil rights? He should be accused the same way for incitement.</p>

Furthermore the term immediate threat even there seems to be too vague and opens the door to governors using it as an excuse to crush political protests (unless they‚Äôre BLM of course cause COVID is woke).</p>
