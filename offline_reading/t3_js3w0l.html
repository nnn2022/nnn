    <strong>Young children growing up right now...</strong>
    <p><p>I know this has been said a lot but...seeing what I‚Äôm going thru at the age of 25...I know eventually I‚Äôll bounce back because I know what life was like pre-covid, so I have something to look forward to. </p>
<p>But the young children growing up (I mean like the ones even too young for grade school) I really feel bad for. They‚Äôre being taught to fear and demonize other peoples‚Äô real faces, and don‚Äôt know any different. </p>
<p>I see what lockdowns and masks have done to my mental health, which was already trash, and I wish I could do more to make sure these kids don‚Äôt grow up fearing a real smile. </p>
<p>I wish I could get a job working with kids just to be able to do something ‚òπÔ∏è. (Before I‚Äôm asked why, I‚Äôve been in some trouble in the past - nothing involving kids or even hurting anyone, but because of it I can‚Äôt get a lot of jobs - working with kids being one of them - and no I‚Äôm not a sex offender.   You‚Äôll have to dig in my post history for an AMA I‚Äôm lazy and it‚Äôs 2:38am)</p>
<p>EDIT:  this hits hard because I have a 2 year old sister, and one of my closest friends is pregnant.</p></p>

        <p>I am grateful I was born in the late 80's, my childhood was 99% offline. Most advanced technology we were using was Pokemon transfers with the link cable between game boys.</p>
<p>Growing up with smartphones and being bombed with all that mind controlling information and confusing social media sounds awful</p>

        <p>I just said this to my buddy. He was born in the early 70s and I'm from the early 80s and both of our childhoods were offline. It was such a happy simpler time. We used our imaginations and played in the dirt with worms and stuff. Things have become so complex and torturous for no reason at all. It's like it's a psychological game to fuck people up on purpose.</p>

        <p>It shocks me that kids as young as my own (6&amp;9) are connected through tech. They have <em>phones</em> !</p>
<p>Obviously my kids play phone games and watch tv, I'm not a monster ü§£ but like hell they're using fucking social media - this includes following Youtuber kids whose parents are using to get rich quick. It's sick.</p>

        <p>So from birth to 5 years is when the brain does its most critical development. </p>
<p>Children in that age range are being taught en masse that their very existence is a direct threat to others, and that every other human‚Äôs existence is a threat to them. </p>
<p>Those children are also missing out on key social development. We heavily and instinctively rely on faces for communication; it‚Äôs hard to gauge what the impact will be on children who miss that input for so long, but it‚Äôs a good bet that it‚Äôs very negative. </p>
<p>Beyond that, this has also killed off ‚Äúinsignificant‚Äù interactions that cumulatively are of great importance. You know when you‚Äôre in line at a store and someone has a baby in front of you, and you smile and wave at the baby, and the baby smiles back? Or when you have a quick laugh with a stranger at Starbucks or in the park in front of their toddler? Those interactions cumulatively shape the way that those children see the world: they teach that new people are good and friendly . Between lockdowns and masks, these types of casual interactions have all but disappeared. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs really not good.</p>

        <p>This is something I worry about often. Even if a parent doesn't brainwash a young child to fear coming close to people, its very sad to see adults outdoors put on a mask as a young (under 2) child approaches, or walk out into the road to avoid being too close to them.  What is that teaching the child? Especially when they were used to walking around and having everyone smile and say hi to them before March.  I have seen my kid grow more and more shy over these past 8 months.</p>

        <p>You do not need to say a single thing to brainwash a child into fearing others - the use of a mask is sufficient, because wearing a mask or seeing others in masks carries an implicit message: you need protection from them, they need protection from you. </p>
<p>That message is absolutely unavoidable, and it‚Äôs hammered into your brain every time you see a mask or wear a mask. Older humans may be able to counter that message with knowledge and experience, but the message is there nonetheless. Children, who cannot counter the message with knowledge and experience, are extremely vulnerable. </p>
<p>The mask itself is brainwashing. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs sad when I‚Äôm more concerned about children than their own parents are. (Not you! Just in general)</p>

        <p>My already extremely shy nearly 9 year old is fucked, I'm pretty sure.</p>
<p>She was making big strides saying thank you, ordering her own food, not hiding behind me when people talked to her in public even if she didn't respond. She was even talking to other kids occasionally.</p>
<p>Took her trick or treating this year and she barely spoke .. almost no stranger has spoken to her since March and all activities have been cancelled. Why wouldn't she go back into her shell ?</p>

        <p>I was voting and everyone was forced into a mask. This man walked by with a hip aged baby and I realized he/she must have been born early this year and I nearly cried..</p>
<p>I smiled at the baby and realized they couldn't even tell. They just looked ahead, blank faced, as Dad walked by the line of people. </p>
<p>I hope the very fact he BROUGHT Baby to such a crowded place means he's a skeptic and makes sure Baby is around others. I know a woman who had a baby late last year who has pretty much been inside the house since early this year.. seeing absolutely no one but the household members. It's heartbreaking to me for this little guy.</p>

        <p>Yeah if it's bordering on traumatic for me having it on and seeing everyone else with it on and never seeing normal people anymore I can imagine for children it's creating an even worse problem. These kids growing up now are going to be so mentally ill. The indoctrination is only keeping them docile while the scars of this all are underneath, they don't know what's really going on besides there's a bunch of propaganda about some virus they have never seen before and that they just "need" to do it. They will not be able to function like normal people if we went back to normal, they didn't have normal experiences and we're brought up on fear of them.</p>

        <p>I work with kids. Trust me, there's nothing you could do even if you were in our line of work. Their parents either encourage them to be free-thinking and normal or to follow the crowd and live in fear. Unfortunately, enough of their teachers and coaches are also stuck in the matrix and only serve to reinforce the media worldview that everything and everyone is a danger. It's truly psychotic. I've seen teachers essentually threaten students to "stay away from each other or we'll all have to go back into lockdown!" and I can't help but think to myself how sick and twisted it is to pass down that guilt and paranoia to the next generation. I'm so grateful that I don't have children and that I grew up in the last remnants of the free world, pre-internet, pre-9/11, all of it.</p>

        <p>I have a 4yr old.  He just turned 4. We don't make him wear a mask anywhere.  Sometimes he will ask for one but will only keep it on a for a little bit. I'm lucky that we have a hand full of neighbor kids and all the parents don't wear masks and no one is crazy Karen.  My wife has a large family(mexicans) And we have had every get together and birthday parties.  We haven't changed anything about our lives really.  He just started in person preschool and they take his temp before he goes in but he doesn't have to wear a mask. The only time me and mom do is right before we enter a store.  We try and raise him away from all the nonsense and just live our lives as normal as possible.</p>

        <p>Just kind of psychological speculation here, but I wonder if infants even recognize mask wearers as other human beings. If you can make yourself "disappear" to them by hiding your face when playing peak-a-boo, does wearing a mask that covers the majority of your face have the same effect?</p>

        <p>That's interesting and I'm not sure. They know eyes, so I assume ? But also when my kids were in the under one group a person they know well could dye their hair, shave off a beard, or even put on/take off glasses without their watching and they'd be totally mindfucked and not know who it was anymore.</p>
<p>I know the first time one of my dogs saw a masked family he lost his mind thinking we needed protection... Dunno if he thought they were not human or thought they were not safe people because they were trying to stay hidden.</p>

        <p>I have a 6&amp;9 year old (well nearly) and what hurts me is that they remember before and ask almost every single day why things are different now (in different terms- more like "when will X open again ?" Or "why can't we go to Y ?" "I miss the zoo" etc)...and I try to explain it to them but I can't because it's above their understanding. They get it but they don't understand Before is gone, Before will never be again. 
I don't know if they will <em>ever</em> see a tiger again or if they will <em>ever</em> eat at a restaurant again or go to a library...and then I wonder if I'm just insane and everyone else is right because how selfish am I to deny them a full life over masks, a vaccine, etc ? I feel like <em>I'm</em> taking it all away from them... And what if we have to eventually flee ? Is it really worth it to live underground on rations to avoid it all ? Is that the life I want for them ?</p>
<p>But as I said, I understand what all of this means... All they fully understand is that the zoo won't let us come without a mask anymore because people are being stupid, ridiculous, and unfair.
So from their viewpoint they're missing out on all of Before but I understand in the end not giving in, not allowing them to give in, is more important than they will ever realize before they're much older. It just makes me fucking sad. </p>
<p>I try to stay optimistic but realistic in my answers with care to not scare them yet, when the time comes they <em>need</em> to be scared I hope I know, right now I'm able to carry that burden for them and will as long as possible... and I'm also keeping papers,pictures, and my own writing about it all in a safe place for them to have when they get older. No matter where we find ourselves I want our history and story to be ready for them to read.</p>
