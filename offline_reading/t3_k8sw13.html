    <strong>Isnt there A LOT of lawyers out there? Why dont they pivot to civil right/ constitutional cases and flood the system like scientology did against the IRS?</strong>
    <p><p>The reason these mandates are allowed to happen is because they are not being challenged. So why doesnt the over supply of unemployed lawyers make it their business to take on cases? </p>
<p>In the 80-90's Scientology got its tax exempt status by flooding the courts with IRS challenges.  This drained the resources and political will at the time. As a result they won.</p>
<p>The same can be done here. Challenge the businesses about masks. Challenge them about vaxxines. Challenge them about not being able to open your business.</p>
<p>Come on lawyers, step on up!</p></p>

        <p>My guess is that they feel (rightfully so in my opinion) they would be vilified by media and public, leading to the demise of their reputation and career. I can’t imagine it’s easy to sue a mayor / governor.</p>

        <p>Hate to burst anybody's bubble but the ACLU never cared about civil liberties <em>per se</em>, it was just a means to an end - the end being patiently chipping away at the traditional WASP power structure / social mores / racial cohesion. In a precedent-based legal system, all you have to do is take some high-profile cases which advance your cause indefinitely into the future: one victory, infinite potential applications down the line. Cost one entity a ton of money in legal fees (and a decision against them), all similar such entities will fall into line automatically, lest they get sued.</p>
<p>Now that they have effectively succeeded (that former power structure being all but obliterated, replaced with Universal Leftism), they don't give two fucks about civil liberties such as free speech and the right to assembly (except for those benefiting Leftism). They are much more concerned with making sure transsexual atheletes are able to compete as their preferred gender.</p>
<p>Pretty brilliant, really.</p>

        <p>As a rule lawyers only work when they are getting paid. Or when they want good press, which is worth whatever a pro bono case might cost them in time.</p>
<p>So my question is, why aren't small and medium-sized businesses teaming up statewide to buy the best legal representation they can find, and fighting this shit in every state with an army of lawyers? I know they aren't doing well financially but if this keeps up they will have absolutely nothing left. What's to lose at this point?</p>
<p>Also, a thought: if all the local / small businesses went on strike, and people were forced to eat McDonald's / wait in line for 3 hours at Wal-Mart for every last thing they need to buy (food + goods), they might actually start to give a shit about what's happening to these businesses. Why should small business continue to accommodate the very people who are cheering on lockdowns and capacity reductions?</p>

        <p>there are no 'lawyers', there are only  BAR 'attorneys', who are themselves 'officers of the (star chamber) courts'</p>
<p>who will pay these attorneys?</p>
<p>millions of bankrupted small businesses? millions of forceably unemployed? the welfare class? the warfare class? the state agent and minion class? banksters? who?</p>
