    <strong>It's all so absurd</strong>
    <p><p>If you really look at the world, its all so absurd! Sitting at the table without a mask and putting it on when going to the toilet for 3 meters. The cashiers at the supermarket behind a plastic shield but touching all the goods you touched and returning your change around said plastic shield. The children standing alone in drawn circles in the school courtyard but are then stuffed inside a bus after school or playing later together without masks on the playground. I could go on....</p>
<p>At least for half a year now almost nobody really follows the rules any more and nobody gets sick. You should know a lot more sick people around you for these measures to be justified. </p>
<p>They are doing a LOT of tests and if just 100 of 100k people are tested positive they close down the whole district although possibly 80 of them don't even have any symptoms.</p>
<p>Why do the majority people not see this?</p>
<p>Most people are just wearing masks because they were told to not because they fear the virus. If tomorrow masks would be optional in supermarkets my guess is that most of the people would not wear them any more. </p>
<p>Most people are just getting the shot to get their life back not because they fear the virus.  </p>
<p>And now there a vaccine passports you will have to show when traveling, going to the gym, to restaurants etc. </p>
<p>Why does the government want to inject every human on earth? Why the propaganda? Why the money or donuts to get vaccinated? Why do they care about our health all of a sudden? </p>
<p>If every life counts why didn't they do the measures during flu season before. That could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the last decade (flu season was non existent this year). Why don't they ban alcohol and cigarettes like weed. </p>
<p>Sorry I had to get this off my chest. Rant over...</p></p>

        <p>Yes but it looks like you have to take part in it soon or be left behind. Soon you will need the vaccination passport for work, travel and life in general.</p>
<p>But you are right, if you can lean back and enjoy the show instead of living in fear, thats a big plus üòÅ</p>

        <p>I recently went back to the office.</p>
<p>I work for a large company in a building that usually houses around 1000 people. There's only about 100 people on site right now (think file clerk level jobs that can't be done remotely).</p>
<p>Anyway they've got all the directional signage up, they've got corridors blocked off so you have to follow the arrow maze, they have sanitation supplies everywhere, and by govt order we are required to wear masks when not at our desks.</p>
<p>There are maybe 3 people on site in my team's area, which normally sits over 100. There is absolutely no one around me.</p>
<p>But if I were to take off my mask when walking to my desk, or not follow the signage, and someone saw me and reported it, or my boss saw me, it would cause a big stink.</p>
<p>It's fucking insane.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO ONE HERE FOR ME TO INFECT! (and I'm not even sick to begin with)</p>

<p>i have no problem doing things that will actually help. stay home if I'm sick, keep my distance if I'm sick. </p>

        <p>LOL, Ban alcohol &amp; weed? You mean 'essential services'? More essential than clothes!!!! Welcome to the Dope Show...</p>
<p>As to your guess, you are sadly, very wrong. I live in Oregon, they are now optional (for the vaccinated). I'm the only one I've seen not wear it. </p>
<p>I'm leaning very hard to the 'precations' are the actual pandemic. SD, FL &amp; TX were supposed to all be dead by now, yet they are doing far better than the 'lockdown' States. </p>
<p>As to why not before for the flu- because back then every actual study showed the masks are useless. Fauci even repeated that when he pulled his "2 masks" bullshit out his ass. (Yet an actual mask that might offer some slight protection- N95, was not recommended. Funny huh?)</p>
