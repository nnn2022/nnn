    <strong>Got stared down for Not Wearing a Mask in Parking Lot</strong>
    <p><p>I was on my way to a rec center where I was going to do some exercise and had a mask in my hand as I was going through the parking lot.  I planned to put it on as I went up to the door since they require it when you walk in, and as I approached about 20 yards away from the door this guy wearing a mask gave me a heavy angry shaming glare and it almost seemed like he was going to be aggressive towards me.  We had to walk past each other and I didn't put my mask on since the door was a ways ahead.  It was pretty awkward when we passed each other.  Before all of the stores were requiring masks I would go into the grocery store without one a few times and I noticed I got some mean looks there too.  </p>
<p>I've read the abstracts and conclusions of a lot of studies about masks and they really do not help, and even if they did and the virus was so bad that everyone should wear one then people shouldn't be going to places like rec centers, restaurants, etc anyway.  </p>
<p>I really think what is happening is more psychological than anything.  It's not that people want to wear masks, but there's a sense of showing other's your a good person that certain "enforcers" are feeling, and the social shaming gets everyone else to comply.  Also our society has so much generalized rage and anger embedded within it at this point, and the mask has become a symbol for people to leverage that hate towards a certain type of person.</p>
<p>The area I grew up in has always been known for being friendly and open.  I hope we don't lose this over time.  I fear that the longer this new normal lasts the more we will lose this connection to one another.  I'm also worried that viruses will start to be used as a regular weapon to keep people on edge and cripple economies, and a full generation of people growing up in this kind of world will certainly start to lose the natural human connections that make life worthwhile.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks for your post. I have the same fears.
It’s like it’s a crime to smile at people!</p>
<p>I want to try an experiment now, and go to the store without a mask on and smile cheesily at everyone and wave and mouth the word HELLO.</p>
<p>I want to see their reactions to this!</p>

        <p>I haven't done this in a store, but I do it on walks/hikes (yes, people in Los Angeles are insane and wear masks to exercise). They PANIC! Their eyes get wide, and they usually jump into the street. One of them almost got hit by the bus. </p>
<p>Imagine being more frightened if pedestrians than the prospect of being hit by a bus!</p>

        <p>I suggest everyone that is mentally sound, financially able and willing to get a concealed carry permit along with additional firearms training. Helps to live in a 2A friendly state too. People are downright insane these days over this rona/mask hysteria. Speak softly but carry a big glock 😂</p>

        <p>Just wait until you get yelled at in person for walking too close to someone else - accidentally! It's horrible. So many people have lost all tolerance and attribute pure malice to innocent mistakes (like, I'm not a mind reader, I didn't know you were going to start walking at that exact moment, lady who yelled at me in the grocery store).</p>
<p>People get mad now if you browse, look at an item and put it back on the shelf, take too long to move your cart, etc. It's really sad and fucked up and it's the reason why I'm staying home now and shopping online wherever possible. At least I can still support some small businesses that I love by shopping online. I have no desire to go into public spaces now.</p>

        <p>No one takes their masks off in the parking lots anymore, everyone’s a mindless drone, I’m sure they don’t even realize they have it on. The mask bothers me, I sweat like a pig under it and it’s 100 degrees out. I’ll wear it in the store just because they’ll tell you “if you don’t have a mask you have to order  pick up”, but I take it off the second I’m out the door.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I was walking up to the store without a mask and this couple walking back, probably in their late 20’s and both extremely obese, decided to tell me that I was being selfish and disrespectful for not walking up to the store with a mask, they were really heated about it. I just kept walking. I came out and I was putting my groceries in the truck and I was like I smell urine. Yup, there was a big puddle of piss surrounding my car... I wish I was joking.</p>

        <p>This is chilling. It's frightening how mindless they all are. Last week, a man yelled, "You should be wearing a mask!" at me as I was walking down the street in my neighborhood. I'm a small woman; he easily had 100 lbs on me. I was frightened, and for some reason, said, "I can breathe". It was surreal, and I was shaking as I walked home. Imagine being so brainwashed that you yell at a stranger walking down the street in a residential neighborhood.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry this happened to you. In a sane world any man around would have defended you. Don't men realize if they yell at a woman, especially if they are tall and/or big, it can be pretty frightening to them. I can't imagine my reaction if someone yelled at my spouse like that.</p>

        <p>&rt; I've read the abstracts and conclusions of a lot of studies about masks and they really do not help, and even if they did and the virus was so bad that everyone should wear one then people shouldn't be going to places like rec centers, restaurants, etc anyway. </p>
<p>A deadly virus isn't going to be stopped by a half ass attempt at a mask.  If it were more deadly, you wouldn't see so many people blatantly disregard the rules as their way to protest.</p>
<p>Masks are security blankets for people who have nothing to do but fear monger because they are stuck at home - at least, when used in the normal population.</p>

        <p>Some guy gave me shit at 711 the other day "Where's your mask?" Without missing a beat, I looked him dead in the eyes and said "It's up your ass, got a problem?" He seemed very taken aback that I was willing to stand my ground and quickly hauled ass away from me. That felt really good, now that's going to be my default response. I'm just fed up at this point. </p>

        <p>I had a horrible moment of insight on incidents like this. I will wear a mask (bandana) if I have to do it to go somewhere I need to go, and I resent having to play a role in the psy-op. The other day, I was in a store, and it was hot as hell, and the mask was definitely making it harder to breath. I passed a guy who had his mask pulled down below his nose and felt this unexpected flash of anger at him. It caught me completely off guard, and I immediately felt ashamed of the feeling. It was jealousy. I was mad that he dared to flaunt the rules when I didn’t have the balls to do it. Then I started imagining how I would feel if I actually believed I was saving others by wearing the mask and that I was so good and so righteous for doing so. Then I just felt dirty and freaked out. Anyway, there is a lot of psychological conditioning happening with all of the mask bs.</p>
