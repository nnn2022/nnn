        <p>I’m about to vote straight R in November. I was done with the Democrats even before this, but I am officially done now. Biden wants a national mask mandate (I’m already thinking of ways to violate mask rules in places because that’s how fed up I am) and he and Harris will not incentivize people to work again or encourage lifting of restrictions. They’ll just find a way to keep printing money so the Reddit cowards can sit home on their lazy good for nothing asses and watch Netflix and not look for work.</p>

        <p>God I wonder how much better off we would have been had we not given away trillions in that tax cut at 2017 that produced no growth. I further wonder how much better off we would have been had we never renewed the cuts under GWB that produced no growth ir the trillions spent on the fraudulent Iraq war.  We could use the tens of trillions wasted there right now. </p>
<p>God I wish we had a parliamentary system so we could hope to one day have a fiscally responsible party in charge.</p>

        <p>It cut the taxes of millions but has produced no growth.  Anyone who has taken even Macro 101 would not have expected it to grow the economy as it was done while the economy was strong and was not funded by spending cuts.  </p>
<p>It was a remarkably stupid move especially considering the cuts done by the GOP under GWB were done under similar circumstances and only exploded the debt.  If we made those cuts now it would have boosted the economy but any attempt to cut taxes ATM will produce weaker results than if we hadn't been so dumb in 2017. </p>
<p>Neither party advocates for fiscal responsibility the only difference seems to be that the democrats want to blow up the debt to help the larger number of people whereas the GOP seems to only benefit the extremely wealthy.</p>

        <p>Well, I think when you look at economic markers and how good the economy was doing I think its tough to justify that the economy did poorly after the tax cuts.</p>
<p>When you give money into the hands of the people (which it substantially did) it makes all their lives better and it increases their spending power because the money goes into circulation rather into the hands of the government (yes it is still in circulation but its spent inefficiently).</p>
<p>I also think that given the massive amount of trade disruption with the trade war with china, and the trade deals that trump has made globally any sort of "you can't show me specifically on a specific metric where the tax cuts showed and you can distinctly and directly showed it" is difficult to do for you, and is imho an unreasonable request.</p>
<p>I can show that the economy continued to grow strongly even under massive trade disruptions on a domestic, and international scale. The stock market (representing corporate value) continued to go up which means increased investments as well as increased spending (profits of corporations); I can also show the economic metrics (unemployment, gdp, investments, etc etc) all went up during trumps presidency.</p>
<p>What evidence do you have that the tax cuts harmed the economy?</p>
<p>I don't think "well, we could have used those tax funds" is much of a real response. Trump was running a ~relatively~ reasonable budget before covid which afterwards is no longer really his bag to hold.</p>

        <p>It isn’t an unreasonable request.  If the economy did in fact grow as a result of these cuts there should be an increase in the rates of growth once they became active.  If it remained steady then it is safe to say they did not produce growth.</p>
<p>The fact that the various indices trended positive while Trump was in office doesn’t mean that Trump’s actions  were the reason why the economy was healthy.  POTUS factually has less impact than the Fed or Congress on the economy so it is possible for these numbers to trend positive in spite of who is in office and not because of them.</p>
<p>You mention the trade war which seems to not have been a wise move either as I doubt you can find many respected economists that back trade wars.  To be clear “economists” means people with an education in economics not Larry Kudlow who has a history degree and one half a semester in a masters econ program he dropped out of.  </p>
<p>The only evidence I need to show harm to the economy is the debt we have incurred which is trillions of dollars.  Unless you want to prove MMT, and good luck there, the existence of debt that we will have to service is all the harm I need to show.</p>

        <p>Because making masks mandatory (they should be my choice) and demanding that others give up a right to an income, the right to worship and practice religion, and their basic freedom of choice isn’t fascist?</p>

        <p>Why tf can u not wear a mask if it means this pandemic will be over sooner suck it up be a adult and help us get back to normal sooner rather then later. People who don’t wear masks are selfish. Or I might just call it natural selection. Downvote me for speaking the truth</p>

        <p>I'm sorry your grandparents died. Mine have too. That wasn't the point.</p>
<p>You've heard "correlation doesn't equal causation" right? They never got the virus because you didn't have it. If you got it and were asymptomatic which a large number of people are - and then transferred it to them - they would be extremely at risk depending on certain factors. But I get it, it's not real to you because you don't have it.</p>
<p>My friend didn't wear a mask, hung out with his friend who had it and coughed in his car, then he got it, brought it home to their family of 4, who all lost their sense of smell. They were the lucky ones. The dad who brought it home (my friend) was hospitalized for 2 weeks. He's upper 40s. If my mom were in that situation, who already has trouble breathing, she'd be dead. I don't see what's so hard to figure out about this. Are the symptoms just not visceral enough for you?</p>

        <p>That's what I said, you're selfish. If you have too choose between your family or society in general, I would understand it entirely if you chose your family, I would do the same.

        <p>I think you know very little about me, however you clearly stated you only care about yourself and your family.  </p>
<p>I think the <em>temporary</em> restrictions were appropriate given how little we knew at the beginning.  And as we learn more, I do fully expect those <em>temporary</em> restrictions to be lifted.  </p>
<p>Look at the colleges that opened - every single one has had a significant outbreak.  We still have things to learn, and need to come up with a better way, <em>temporarily</em>.</p>
<p>As an ex Christian - the building you worship in is <em>far</em> less important than how, and who you worship.  If you feel otherwise, you are interpreting the Bible to fit your current needs.</p>

        <p>The restrictions should have already been lifted. People like you say it’s temporary but it has already been six months. No wonder people like me are so sick of sacrificing and done cooperating. People like you say “it’s just temporary!” but what you mean is that this could go on for years </p>
<p>I personally need the building to worship. Facebook Live Mass does nothing and I refuse to participate. Nor have I returned to church because of mask requirements and being told not to sing.</p>
<p>Do you not get that we can’t just keep life on hold until we have zero cases? Even if every college closes tomorrow and has online classes for all of the academic year there will still be cases in August 2021.</p>

        <p>\&rt;&rt;  Do you not get that we can’t just keep life on hold until we have zero cases?  &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>I think that that was the case and it clearly worked in the countries that used that approach - Australia, New Zealand, all the Pacific Islands, South Korea, etc. etc. But it didn't catch on in the US, and by this stage it doesn't really matter who you blame. The fact is that the virus is now pretty much endemic - lodged in the country, so to speak. Faced with this resistance, and accepting that a lockdown to clear the cases already within the US population would take months of stay-at-home rules, what to do? Is the answer just to let the virus saturate the US and let those who die, die?</p>
<p>If so, there are two questions that you need to answer (and one supplementary):</p>
<p>a) exactly how many deaths are acceptable?</p>
<p>b) how will the US cope with the worldwide travel ban on its citizens? If one country takes a different path, like the US, then the other countries will not want to risk their hard work in eradicating the virus be put at risk. This means that any US industry or commerce overseas will basically grind to a halt. Is this acceptable to the majority of US citizens as a price to pay for ignoring health measures right now? If so, all good, we just need to hear you say it.</p>
<p>supplementary) there are a growing number of reports that while youths generally survive catching Covid-19 there are some very worrying side-effects. These include brain damage and permanent damage to lungs, livers, etc. Is this acceptable, if it turns out to be true?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm all for an alternative solution as it's clear that the US is way past easy or traditional solutions. What do you have?</p>

        <p>Of course I get that life can't be kept on hold.  And it isn't.  I think you really need to put things in perspective.  Look at Australia, new Zealand, Singapore, Panama, Peru, Argentina, etc.  They all have far more restrictive measures in place.  This "poor me ((United States))" attitude is pretty obtuse.</p>
<p>If being in a house in worship is the only way you can worship your God, then maybe you are there for social reasons more than spiritual reasons.  And that's ok - but call it what it is.</p>

        <p>Natural herd immunity. If masks work, then they make the pandemic last longer. Isn’t the whole point of masks to slow the spread? If your side wants the pandemic to end sooner rather than later, you need to change your slogan to #acceleratethespread... and stop wearing masks.</p>

        <p>Yes, some people, mostly elderly, will be dispatched by COVID-19. Man is mortal like that. When you get old, you die. Moreover, many people will perish due to the poverty and hardship caused by the restrictions. We can get through this fast or it can happen slowly. You’re going to have to explain to me how dragging this out for a long time is better for employment because that’s quite astonishingly counterintuitive.</p>

        <p>Furthermore this “find a cure” phrase that you’ve used is quite out of place. This isn’t multiple sclerosis. Almost everyone recovers from COVID-19 in short order and without a problem. Are you under the impression that this is usually a deadly disease? If so, I’m going to let you deepen your understanding of the issues on your own. Good luck with your research.</p>

        <p>How many of those people would have died of something else in the next 12 months anyway? How many people die in that country in a normal year, all causes considered? How many years of life will be lost on account of economic devastation? Have you considered those questions or is this the first time you’re being exposed to them?</p>

        <p>Why do you think that? Biden has been very consistent in his messaging to wear a mask. If you look at countries where masks are widely adopted, their lockdowns were much less severe and lasted for a much shorter time. </p>
<p>Plus, Biden won’t waste his time on bullshit snake oil cures. That focus alone should speed up the timeline for a vaccine.</p>

<p>For good reason. Until all the rushed and badly done studies that came out during this pandemic, it was generally accepted that widespread mask use in the public outside of a healthcare enviornment was not helpful. Even now the evidence is extremely weak.</p>

        <p>You do know that it takes a while to die from COVID right? The problem with increasing cases is that in 2 weeks, there will also be an increase in deaths.

<p>See, I stopped reading right here. It's this hypocrisy that has turned me away from all the lockdown bullshit. By that logic, we should be locked down forever because of all the diseases that kill people. Or are the yearly 600-700k deaths more acceptable for you than COVID deaths? Because as shocking as it may be to learn, humans were dying every day before it became trendy for you guys to start caring. 160k people died on your birthday, but I can bet that you were partying and not caring at all. Hell, you probably didn't even know. 380k people in nursing homes die every year from infections ALONE. What about the 1.5 million who die yearly from TB? That number is going to be higher this year because of our stupidly myopic focus on COVID. Should we lockdown for those too?</p>
<p>You only care about COVID deaths because it's trendy. It's easy to go online and proclaim you care so that you can get social brownie points. Not once in your life have you given a shit about everyone else who died from infectious diseases, so let's stop pretending that you or anyone else really does so now.</p>
<p>UNICEF predicts 6000 children dying daily from starvation caused by the lockdowns. I don't see outrage for that. Suicides have risen in many places dramatically. No one seems to care. Poverty, which is associated with increased mortality, has gone up immensely because of the economic fallout. Yet no one cares.</p>
<p>So what's special about this? Who decided that THIS is the disease that we suddenly have to give a shit about?</p>

<p>Bad news. We're all mortal beings, and we're all going to die.  </p>
<p>&rt;If locking down could avoid that, isn’t that best option? </p>
<p>Locking down almost certainly <em>can't</em> avoid that, at least not without causing even more premature death and human suffering via, e.g., increased poverty, joblessness, stress, anxiety, substance abuse, suicide, etc.</p>
<p>&rt;Or maybe you think getting to go to the movies is more important than someone dying.</p>
<p>To some extent, <em>everyone</em> thinks that -- and should! Every time you get behind the wheel, even if you're stone-cold sober and a super-conscientious driver, you are thereby putting other motorists and pedestrians you might encounter at some heightened risk of death from an accident you might cause, e.g., as a result of an unfortunately-timed moment of inattention, being stung by a bee, having your first seizure, etc. Indeed, car accidents claimed the lives of around 36,560 Americans in 2018, and caused serious (sometimes debilitating) injuries for a <em>few million</em> more. ("Motor vehicle-related injuries send more than 2.3 million people to hospital emergency departments every year.") And many of those people were young and otherwise healthy.  The disease burden of auto accidents in the US in a given year in terms of life years lost or quality-adjusted life years lost is almost certainly quite a bit higher than the US disease burden of COVID-19 will be for all of 2020. And yet we don't ban cars, or even just "non-essential" car trips. ("How dare you drive to a theater just to watch a movie? Or to the beach just to watch a sunset? Or 500 miles just to visit your grandkids -- that's what Facetime is for? Don't you realize you're putting other's lives at risk when you do?")  And that's because <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/lord-sumption-the-lockdown-is-without-doubt-the-greatest-interference-with-personal-liberty-in-our-history/">"there is more to life than the avoidance of death."</a></p>

        <p>Sorry, getting a little conversation whiplash here. Can I infer from the sudden topic change that you've accepted the arguments I made in my previous comment?</p>
<p>&rt;You think wearing a mask is bad?</p>
<p>I think wearing a mask is going to have different costs and benefits for different individuals in different contexts (e.g., they can be fun at Halloween).  Do I think the routine wearing of face masks by presumably-healthy, asymptomatic individuals in public is "bad"? Yes, absolutely.  It creates a more paranoid, fearful, and dehumanized environment for everyone, and inhibits normal human socialization and communication.  But I think people should be free to wear them if they so choose (or not wear them if that's their choice). Or patronize only establishments that have mask requirements (or only establishments that don't).  Expanded thoughts <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/id1z2q/its_not_about_our_safety_its_about_making_us/g27rlld/">here</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;Boy you would’ve been in real trouble back when we had the draft.</p>
<p>Sorry, am I misreading your tone here, or is the same guy that wrote "one death should be too many" speaking approvingly of conscripting people to fight and die in war? The draft was a pretty fucked-up thing. It's obviously an extraordinary infringement of personal freedom (yes, even worse than a mask mandate).  But so what...? "It's not as bad as the draft" is about as useful an argument as "it's not as bad as genocide" or "it's not as bad as slavery." Few things are.</p>

        <p>That's funny. It seems to me that the ones being completely "selfish and self-centered" and exhibiting an unhealthy "sense of entitlement" are those seeking to use the coercive violence of the state to control others' lives in a massively-misguided, fantastically-destructive, and frankly "stupid" effort to assuage their own fears.  But anyways, it was nice chatting with you. Stay safe!</p>

        <p>Its true, but ya still gotta go through the motions. 2016 should have been a huge wake up call for Dems, instead they doubled down on the stupidity and hubris.

        <p>Ya I’m honestly wondering if they want to lose based upon how poor of a candidate they picked. Then they can still throw a tantrum but not have to make any changes. I really think it’ll be a repeat of 2016 and the DNC has nobody to blame but themselves. I wanted a strong, articulate, sensible candidate to change my mind but Biden wasn’t it so it’ll be Trump for me.</p>

        <p>The Dems at state level need to be voted out too then. I'm like OP in that I was a lifelong Dem voter but im just over the Democrats shit. They didn't get it in 16 and either they get it in 20 or they crash and burn. Hopefully what replaces them is better because I'm not delusional about the Republicans either.</p>

        <p>Reading this discussion I'm having a mental picture of a battle for states rights and have concerns about a Federal mask mandate getting tied up in the courts... I mean the powers not specifically granted to the Fed is left to the states. I'll admit some ignorance with respect to the legal precedents both for and against, outside of what's laid out in the Constitution.</p>

        <p>Well, the federal government could argue interstate commerce (stores, etc, cross state lines with supply chains) and national pandemic, states would argue that circumstances differ from state to state and the fed gov't is not empowered to reach down into local stuff that far.</p>
<p>The fed might argue for mask standards (wrt to material, etc), that would probably pass. But then enforcement would be pushed onto the state, and unfunded mandates are bad.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot of court cases involved too, so it's hard to say what would happen.</p>
<p>See: the drinking age</p>
<p>Federal government said its 21 or we pull funding, courts said you can pull some, but not all. So... Yeah</p>

I feel that they sit on their hands over important matters that can positively impact citizens while rushing out legislation that only benefits them and/or the highest donors.

        <p>I get the sentiment that both parties are rotten, but it's pretty clear to me that Trump is an outsider to their games.  If it were an election between Mitt Romney and Biden, I'd agree with you.  The fact that they are so fucking terrified of Trump and so welcoming of Mitt Romney is good evidence that a / the correct fuse is being lit somewhere.</p>

        <p>Yea I think that Trump’s been neutral at first he didn’t want lockdowns but then it all went down. He was never wearing a mask before, only publicly wore it in the hospital.   He hasn’t been a doomer but he hasn’t been stopping it. Apart of it is the election people are so freaking scared of this   His federally appointed judge went against CA with the churches so yea it gives me better hope than Biden.</p>

        <p>Exactly, still blows me away that people believe there is a difference between Republicans and Democrats. They all work for the same people- and those people are NOT the average Americans. Past couple of elections I have voted third party- most people say that it's a wasted vote but at least I can confidently say I voted for a party that I believe in, and didn't just vote for the 'lesser of two evils'.</p>

        <p>I’m a libertarian and voting gold this year, but I am holding out some hope that Trump might be able to do something in his second term. Perhaps he won’t be as afraid to be politically crucified if he doesn’t have an election to win. Although to be frank, as a libertarian, there isn’t much that I would support him doing about this whole thing, if I were to remain ideologically consistent. He could theoretically enact some federal mandates that bar states from making ridiculous mask and lockdown orders but that too treads along the thin line towards authoritarianism. In other words, anything Trump would do wouldn’t be much better philosophically than what the orders that are active now are doing already. </p>
<p>He could, though, threaten to withhold federal funding if states keep up the idiocy as a way of gaining leverage against them. Just like Reagan did with federal highway funds to raise the drinking age. I’m not 100% sold on the idea (still seems too authoritarian to me), but on the other hand in our current legal framework, the federal government <em>can</em> intervene to protect civil rights. I’m afraid my biases come into play here though.</p>

        <p>Communism and fascism are separate things and not to be divided with a backslash. Further, fascism is the merging of state and corporate power, which has already happened. Fascism is putting giant walls around your white house like it's a compound, then sending DHS agents (see: Privatized Blackwater mercenaries) into cities to further antagonize the situation. This is the EXACT scenario 2A and early alex Jones fans warned about: unidentified federal troops descending upon domestic territory like a private army.</p>
<p>Communism is not possible in the US. The opposite of "income inequality" is not communism or "everyone making the same salary". We are already in a highly leveraged situation of service workers vs high dollar earners. Average wages have stagnated while corporations pay zero in taxes. Americans already subsidize Walmart with their tax dollars to pay for the food stamps their employees have to draw due to low wages. There is nothing sustainable about our current economy, and arguing to change the rules does not make you a communist.</p>

        <p>No - what I'm saying is:</p>
<p>1) A party platform which seeks to address income inequality does not make it communism or socialism.</p>
<p>2) When nationalistic republicans rail against "socialism" - I ask them to define it. They say "everyone makes the same amount of money". Of course that is beyond ignorant, but that's the point I was making.</p>
<p>But socialism is not the same as communism. And a <em>social democracy</em>, which I am in favor of, is even further removed from communism.</p>
<p>When you talk about "capitalism with a safety net and market regulations" - we don't have that, OK? It has completely run off the rails and the people writing the rules (both sides, same coin) are the ones who stand to gain the most from them. </p>
<p>So again, arguing to increase minimum wage is not, in ANY WAY, communistic. Switching to medicare for all is not communistic. The healthcare system is beyond broken - it is destructive and actively destroying our society. Unregulated capitalism allowed social media companies to <strong>almost completely</strong> dictate the way our society functions now before Congress (or citizens) even knew what happened. Unregulated capitalism led to massive consolidation of industry, destroying communities. Unregulated capitalism seeks to inhale everything in its path. Religion, culture, social fabric, privacy, and so on. WE ARE HERE. It has succeeded. </p>
<p>So sure, call it whatever you want - call it "extremely well regulated capitalism" - but it has fed like a leech on the middle class and now, participating in society goes one of two ways: end up very successful, or living a hopeless life.</p>

        <p>I have been a Democrat my entire adult life, but it's kind of a "requirement" as a gay person. With that said, my politics have done a complete 180 since March for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every liberal I know has lost their f'ing minds over COVID. It's brainwashing by MSNBC and it's frightening. So many of them still refer to "lockdown" or "quarantine" and I literally have no idea what planet they spend most of their time on. I live in the Chicago burbs and with the exception of the dystopian nightmare that current is Downtown Chicago, life is pretty much back to normal here. </li>
<li>I'm a proud realist and I questioned the economic impact of the lockdown from the start. This might have been sustainable for a month AT BEST, but a lockdown without end that has constantly changing goalposts will be destructive to a level no one seems to fully comprehend. </li>
<li>The fact that lockdown fetishists completely disregard the impact of lockdowns to the mental health of everyone from kids to the elderly is disgusting. Period. End of story. </li>
<li>The hypocrisy of saying the protests/riots in May/June were totally fine because "everyone has on a mask" is just ridiculous. If every lockdown protestor had a mask on the narrative would have still been "SELFISH GRANDMA KILLERS!"</li>
<li>Teachers unions (DEMOCRATS) are gross and are turning this political and are essentially demonizing children as "teacher killers". Some of them are even refusing to teach remotely from home because it's a "violation of their privacy". Well...what is it? </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still not voting for Trump because he's an awful person and a bad leader, but I now consider myself a proud conservative thanks to COVID!</p>

        <p>The idea that a gay person is also a leftist is so weird. I guess this is related to the fact that a portion of the "right" is more conservative in nature and was somehow more opposed to homosexuality in recent history. With that being said, the economic right is more about individual freedoms and less government intervention which is very much in agreement with sexual freedom. My brother is gay and has been an economic/fiscal conservative for as long as I can remember. He's very tired of the left trying to tell him how he should think and vote since he's gay. I'm more of a libertarian myself so I do not identify as right or left, but one thing is sure, I'm opposed to the current leftist movement that is all about control and big government.</p>
<p>This is also a switch from a few decades ago when being a "liberal" meant being for personal freedom of choice in all matters of life.</p>

        <p>The Democratic Party is the only religion it is socially acceptable within the gay community to be a member of. I have always been a fiscal conservative but was socially liberal when Republicans were actively fighting against my right to marry. When SCOTUS resolved that it pretty much eliminated any need I had to support Democrats. COVID annihilated any thought I had that I was still a Democrat.</p>

        <p>How ungrateful of you. One party supported your Rights to the bitter end and the other fought their hardest to end it, yet you go to the party that wanted to end it because of the scotus decision? Will you be running back to Democrats when republicans try to undermine your Rights again to exercise their "religious freedoms"?" There is a reason the gay community support the Democrats and it is not just out of loyalty but because the other party doesn't even accept them fully.</p>

        <p>I'm very grateful for the support Democrats provided in the fight for marriage equality, but we also can't forget that Democrats like President Obama said marriage was between a man and a woman for a LONG time and conservative Republican lawyers like Ted Olson fought for our rights in court. I don't believe in identity politics and I've voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past. I vote for the best candidate, regardless of party affiliation. If the rest of the country did the same maybe we wouldn't be so polarized. </p>
<p>I never said I was a Republican either. I'm an independent conservative but there is no way I can align with the Party of Trump, QAnon and religious fundamentalists.</p>

        <p>Yes! You can be conservative without supporting Trump! People tend to forget that... I have conservative views, but I'm not sure there's a single politician out there I really support.

        <p>I'm not American. I'm Canadian. But our politics have gotten just as whack. It's my hope for you guys that if the Republicans win again. The Democrats might re-evaluate their platform and realize the centrist working class vote is important and that most Americans actually like America (Mind you that was my hope when Hillary lost.) You are really caught between a rock and a hard place. It so heartbreaking to watch scenes of New York City right now.</p>

        <p>I have always been liberal in the past, at least on policies, but Democrat culture has gone completely off the deep end.  </p>
<p>The constant barrage of anti-Trump shit is like a disease.  I don't like the guy either but Jesus don't you get tired of complaining about him at some point?  Then they rally behind an ill-looking, hair-sniffing, ass-grabbing, crime-bill-signing, career politician septuagenarian who can't even make it through a full sentence without forgetting where he is, and the only thing they have to say in his favor is "HE'S NOT TRUMP! ANYONE BUT TRUMP!"  Even his own campaign has no substance to it aside from "vote for me to get orange man out of office."  At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if they voted for a sack of rice just because it isn't Trump.  Being <em>that</em> obsessed with one person isn't healthy.  I swear for some people it's a manifestation of OCD.</p>
<p>Many, especially people my age (20s) have become literal communists.  They blame everything, including their own shortcomings, on capitalism,  and they think that just handing over full control of everything to the government is somehow going to save them from themselves.</p>
<p>This COVID/lockdown bullshit is just the final nail in the coffin.  They twist it to be all about politics and somehow turn a public health issue into an "orange man bad" circlejerk, and then they have the balls to accuse <em>him</em> and <em>Republican governors</em> of "making the virus political"!  They push these tyrannical lockdowns and nonsensical restrictions on what you can and can't do, and if you dare to question any of it they just accuse you of being a "right wing shill" and scream nonsense about how bad Trump is until you give up and walk away.</p>
<p>I can't stand it any more.  I no longer talk politics with liberal friends or on liberal subreddits, because they have completely lost all sense of nuance and it's impossible to have a reasonable discussion or healthy discourse with them any more.  I'm sure all my liberal friends think I'm a Trumper by now.  I don't even give a shit.  I'd rather be perceived as a Trumper than a far left nutjob at this point.</p>

        <p>That's your prerogative, but I encourage you to take 15 minutes, read up on the down-ballot races and show up for those. The majority of decisions regarding masks and reopening schools and businesses will occur at the local level and the freedom-candidates will need your vote in those races.</p>

<p>Two years ago I would NEVER have believed this. One year ago, it was slightly more of a possibility, but I would never have admitted it to anyone else I knew.</p>

        <p>The restrictions should have already been lifted. People like you say it’s temporary but it has already been six months.

        <p>Me too. Never voted Republican in my life- voting straight ticket GOP in Nov. I’m done. I put 90% of the blame for this lockdown BS on Democrats and the media. Republicans are caving WAY too much but they are still WAY better than Dems. If my kid can’t go to school or to the playground, our business can be closed indefinitely at any time, and I have to wear a muzzle every time I leave the house....the rest just doesn’t matter anymore IMO.</p>

        <p>Trump's not that bad.  Watch some Tim Pool and Karlyn Borosenko on YouTube, they're lefties voting red.  Also recommend FleccasTalks and Vladimir Jaffe if you want to see how insane the left has become.  If you want to hear conservatives talk try Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin is good with his guests, Crowder is a bit much but he's always factually correct.</p>

        <p>Jo Jorgenson. She's the libertarian candidate. I don't know much about her platform but you can look it up. If the choice between not voting and voting for her I strongly recommend voting for her. If she gets enough votes it might shake up the system.</p>

        <p>There are actually several other choices but the number of votes they get render them insignificant. The Libertarian Party is the biggest and best known of them, and in its entire history, its very best showing has been 1% of the vote.</p>

        <p>Same, but I think I'm going to sit this one out. Neither side is putting up anyone I have any confidence in. I won't vote for Trump for obvious reasons, but I also won't vote for a party that supports antifa and blm (the organization, not the sentiment; I absolutely believe police and justice dept need serious reform, but its not defunding or dismantling). There's not a lesser of two evils, both parties are equally useless, and it makes no sense to throw my vote away on a non-entity.</p>

        <p>I’m Independent and didn’t vote in 2016 because I didn’t like Trump or Hillary. And I took the lazy way out rather then voting 3rd party like my husband did.
But this time I’m voting for Trump. It’s not Biden that worries me as much as Harris does. Coz I really think if Biden wins he won’t be president long and then Harris will take over. 
I’m just worried about what will happen before and after the election. I’m worried they will make the current riots look like “peaceful protests”.</p>

        <p>Most people saw a cut but most of the money went into the hands of corporations that engaged in buybacks or to wealthier people.  The average cut was not significant enough to offset the debt incurred. </p>
<p>The question isn't "was the economy strong after the cuts", rather it is "did the cuts have any impact beyond the debt incurred"?  You can call it unreasonable all you want but frankly that's you avoiding backing up your claim that it <em>grew</em> the economy. </p>
<p>Yes parts of the economy improved while Trump was in office BUT <em>you need to prove that it was because of Trump and not in spite of him</em>.  You have already cited the trade war which was also harmful to the economy which further demonstrates the lack of fiscal responsibility by the GOP.</p>

        <p>I have no data to back it up, and I'm no macro (or any sort of) economist by any stretch of the imagination, but my thoughts are that part of the reason the trade war has hurt us is due to the fact that we sent so many manufacturing tasks overseas that they had (have?) to be rebuilt here. It seems to me it's a long game, not a short one. On the tax cut side my personal experience is that I saw a reduction in my payroll taxes and as a result of my increased net income I have both increased my savings as well as consumer spending. I can't be the only one, right?</p>

        <p>If you had any macro you would know trade wars are considered to only harm the consumers and don’t have a history of being good ideas.  One of Trump’s biggest issues from a purely economics perspective is that he selects advisors who agree with him and thus gets people like Kudlow whom the better regarded academics tend to look down upon largely because the projections from guys like Kudlow are more often wrong than right.  Trump would be better off if he sought the best people rather than those that confirm his biases.  Sadly for the GOP most of the better conservative leaning economists have left the party or are expressing extreme displeasure with the party’s policy choices.  </p>
<p>In general trade wars are regarded as extremely stupid undertakings.</p>

        <p>I feel like I have no choice. I hate the Republicans. I used to consider myself a leftist too. What the fuck happened? The left has gone on a deep dive into authoritarianism. And Trump is awful but seriously, he is NOT the fascist monster the Democrats are making him out to be. It's absurd. They're the ones who are shutting down society and implementing total control over people's lives. At least Trump doesn't hate America and all of its institutions. </p>
<p>I REALLY would like to feel comfortable voting for the Democrats again. I'd love it if the Democrats actually started caring about the American middle and working classes again and investing in the future of the country. I used to (and still do!) consider myself a very progressive and open minded person. But the current left has lost the plot. They're not open minded anymore, they hate everyone who opposes them and will silence anyone who gets in their way. That's not the left I used to support.</p>

        <p>We have given trump chances to help solve this and what has he done? He has thrown out the idea of injecting bleach. He did not wear masks for months( scientifically proven to work) and he golfs as the USA hits 150k deaths. Biden will put better mask/lockdown laws. Ik y’all don’t like it I don’t either but I’m willing to step up for the country and wear a piece of cloth if it means we will lose less lives and this will be over sooner. And people who say trump can’t do anything about it. Japan is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and they never went into economic shutdown and not many people lost their jobs. It can be done but what We are doing currently is not it. I’m in Massachusetts hell we are doing amazing w the virus. People wear masks everywhere.</p>

        <p>All this would have been over a couple months ago if people wore their masks. but I guess putting a piece of cloth over your face is "too hard" and violates peoples "freedom." Just wear your masks you goons</p>

        <p>Typically those on the left only have insults in their bag of tricks.  Logic, facts, reason, and rational dialog have left them long ago.  But I suppose that is what happens when emotion starts dictating all decisions and responses.</p>

<p>Also, I agree with the other people here who say it doesn't matter who wins at this point. There seems to be an equal opportunity for both sides to fuck up shit no matter what. But who knows what'll happen...</p>
