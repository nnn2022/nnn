    <strong>So much for Herd Immunity....</strong>
    <p><p>with more and more States lifting mandates, alot of the Doomers are freaking out and its both pathetic and pretty amusing tbh. Their wet dream is Vaccine passports/IDs, but the thing is that will never happen and they know; because thats an easy civil lawsuit just waiting to happen. For me personally, my family has been pressuring me really hard to get vaxxed because they fear that because im overweight i am higher risk. For me, i am fat; but i work out 4 times a week and i hardly eat fast food.  Also the fact my family has watched a little to much cable news and believe Covid is the end all be all doesnt help. tho obviously we arent talking about that lol.</p>
<p>there was a post that someone did where the CDC LITERALLY changed what the definition of Herd immunity is to fit their bullshit messaging. When someone touts that everyone needs to get the vaccine, that is incorrect. 70% is the number where herd immunity will kick-in; most likely their gonna claim we should have it over 90% with zero facts behind it but hey. They never explain why someone who got covid and recovered from it needs to get a vaccine when the literal reason the immune system exists is to fight viruses. there is a cell called a Memory cell which works to fight a virus that comes into your system, vaxxed or not.</p></p>

        <p>The gov't will offer as many 'free' pcr tests as we want but we have to pay for a antibody test. If the gov't was offering antibody tests so people could make an informed decision based on their natural immune response, maybe less would be rushing to get a vaccine.</p>

        <p>My cat got covid, it was absolutely disgusting and we thought he was going to die. Got some weird cat cold drops that we shoved in his mouth 3-4 times a day for 12 days before he was back to normal. Makes me wonder how many other pets got it but no one talked about it.</p>
<p>We found green goo snot on the ceiling. It was insane.</p>

        <p>A couple years ago our cats all got the cat flu shot and GOT the flu.  Sneezing snot legit everywhere.  Called the vet and they said, yes, they can actually get the flu from the shot. No humans in the house got it but it was gross and the cats were miserable.  </p>
<p>It’s too bad human medicine can’t the the truth.</p>

        <p>Yeah omg it was awful! Poor baby was so weak, wheezing and couldn't even clean himself. We have two cats and the other one was fine, not even a sniffle from him. It was so weird. We tried to separate them but the little one wasn't having it and insisted on being near the sick one the whole time.</p>

        <p>i hate to say this op, but theres no such thing as "healthy" overweight (depending on how overweight you are). Even the covid statistic data says you cant exercise and eat healthy your way out of comorbidity issues. You need to lsoe weight if you want to be low risk. I highly recommend doing so, as it can have awesome unforeseen consequences on your body, imo</p>
