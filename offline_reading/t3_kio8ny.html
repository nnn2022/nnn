        <p>&rt;If you idiots think the mask is making it hard for you to breathe</p>
<p>"You're all idiots for thinking it's factually more difficult for you to breathe" lol wtf. I guess fuck all the people with asthma too.</p>
<p>&rt;If you think social distancing/not wearing a mask doesn't work, it does.</p>
<p>Depends on what you define as "working". I'm sure it's helped in small amounts here and there, but not enough to be relied upon to the extent that it currently is. Masks are only going to work if essentially everyone wears them, wears them properly, stores them properly, doesn't touch them all the time, and wears a quality of mask that's actually effective at doing something. Plus, you'd need to pair all that with large-scale lockdowns, which is a ridiculously terrible idea to begin with, to really see a significant result.</p>
<p>&rt;when people don't abide by social distancing, they get sick.</p>
<p>Well considering there are a shit ton of people who reported always wearing a mask and socially distancing, yet still contracted this virus, it most certainly goes both ways.</p>
<p>&rt;I am swamped with work, we are completely full</p>
<p>I'll give you the benefit of the doubt with that paragraph. So even if it's 100% true, it's still purely anecdotal at best. It's quite similar to a cop who polices a small, relatively safe town, but believes that his town is quite dangerous since he's on the front lines and seeing some terrible stuff in the streets. It's always gonna seem worse than what it actually is when you're in such a position.</p>
<p>&rt;its only because you are giant babies bc "muh rights"</p>
<p>It's about plenty more than someone's rights, freedoms, and liberties. Love how you say this as though a tiny fraction of the general populous is directly responsible for all the deaths the world has experienced.</p>
<p>I always found it disgusting how people are so openly willing to shit all over their rights, freedoms, and liberties - things that so many people would and have died just to get chance at attaining. It really shows that you don't have any idea how good you have it in today's age in the Western world.</p>
<p>&rt;you are literally spitting in peoples faces when you breathe/talk.</p>
<p>Uhhhhh, no? Besides, if you're truly that paranoid and terrified of this weak as fuck virus and us scary people, then feel free to stay home and truly don't put others at risk. It's easier than ever to stay home and be lazy.</p>
<p>&rt;Enjoy crying over nothing</p>
<p>(Says the person who came here strictly to cry)</p>
<p>&rt;you sad and pathetic losers who are so spoiled by the first world</p>
<p>(Says the person who is openly shitting all over their freedoms, liberties, and rights - the same ones that afford them the opportunities to come here and bitch at others.)</p>
<p>&rt;wearing a piece of cloth and being told to keep your distance is enough for you to claim oppression.</p>
<p>Stay home if you're so afraid. That simple.</p>

        <p>First if all I know people with asthma and wearing a mask isn't a problem for them most of the time, but you know what would be a big problem for them? Contracting covid. And second of all, this post isn't about me being afraid. I had covid, it sucked but I got over it since I'm young and healthy. But this is about sick people, with preexisting conditions. Like my grandparents, or your grandparents. We need to keep infection rates lower, so that we have more hospital space for people like them. Its selfish to only look at this virus from your own perspective.</p>

        <p>&rt;wearing a mask isn't a problem for them most of the time</p>
<p>Lol coming from someone who's had asthma his entire life, yet doesn't even put up a fuss about wearing a mask when a business requires me to in order to enter, I strongly disagree. Am I gonna suffocate? No. But acting like it doesn't restrict your breathing capabilities, regardless if you have asthma or not, is silly.</p>
<p>&rt;you know what would be a big problem for them? Contracting covid.</p>
<p>Then they should stay home if they're so terrified, and/or take all the proper precautions necessary in order to ensure that they feel safe. The world is cleaner and more sanitary than ever.</p>
<p>&rt;this is about sick people, with preexisting conditions. </p>
<p>Who should be protected. We should all take a personal responsibilty of ensuring any of our friends amd family who are quite vulnerable to this virus are protected, take any all proper precautions that we deem necessary to stay safe, and let everyone else go live their lives as they see fit.</p>
<p>&rt;Its selfish to only look at this virus from your own perspective.</p>
<p>I'm not, that's the thing. All of these mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns really haven't at all harmed me. But I know the economic crash, paired with massive amounts of increased job loss, poverty, starvation, educational failure, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, anxiety, depression, and suicide, amongst plenty of other things, have taken a definitive toll on countless people aroumd the world. All to possibly stop this virus from maybe potentially infecting someone, and maybe kind sorta possibly harming them.</p>

        <p>Same concept. You're always going to think it's terrible when you're the one who physically sees something happen.</p>
<p>But don't you guys have huge mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns in place? And have never really even opened up at all? Things that should, in theory, be working?</p>

        <p>So in your puny little mind, Discord == teenagers. Yeah I'm sure they hired a teenager as a security guard at this place. I just told you you'll be free to join and watch while he's on shift, but you ignored it of course because you don't want it to pop your little bubble.</p>

Willing to lockdown everything and bankrupt businesses because somewhere, maybe, in the chain of transmission of this weak virus, you might contaminate someone who might contaminate someone vulnerable. </p>
<p>By this logic we should lockdown forever without question.

        <p>Lol what. Nobody is socially distancing here in Japan. You obviously have no clue.</p>
<p>I actually live in Japan; Trains are still packed, restaurants karaokes and the red light districts are open and have good attendance.</p>
<p>As soon as people enter these locations, masks go off and everything goes to normal.</p>
<p>By American thinking standards Japan should be being crushed by Covid, but obviously this isn‘t the case.</p>
<p>This just goes to show you that Mask Wearing isn‘t thr silver bullet for whichever issue you are having in the US ( be it fearmongering by media, misrepresentation of „cases“ vs actually sick people, or just American people being less healthy in general).</p>
<p>And you should stop harassing people that don‘t wear masks for the situation you are in.</p>

        <p>↑ How does that happen when just months ago they were praised for being such a low infection rate country. I cannot believe anything on the news anymore. Anything can be false or inaccurate. All political.</p>

        <p>Ummm, I'm pretty sure Germany was the only ones with the low infection rate at the time with because they acted early in January (and the US probably would have if they weren't playing the impeachment games) and Sweden's herd immunity failed.</p>

        <p>That’s a bunch of BS, I live in Japan. We are not isolating nor social distancing 🤣</p>
<p>Hell, we couldn’t social distance here if we tried. Everywhere is crowded here daily, stores are packed full of people and inside trains are like being stuffed into a sardine can. If you doubt me, go watch live videos of Japan over on YouTube.</p>

        <p>Is that a fact? Oh my! Patients that can’t breathe or collapsing!😧 Gosh, the horror!So erm, BIG question for you if I may...?</p>
<h1>Why the fuck haven’t we seen this out in public?</h1>
<p>I live in Japan, you know... That tiny super crowded country right next door to China. I haven’t warn a mask since March and I go out in public around thousands of people daily. We couldn’t social distance here even if we wanted. I ride trains daily smashed into others, I can literally feel them breathing on me. Never once have I seen anyone sick, collapsing or dying.</p>
<p>I’m also a teacher teaching children and drive to over 16 schools a week. Each day I’m around thousands of kids who constantly touch me, sneeze around me and pick their noses. None of the children have been sick, no staff either.</p>
<p>I‘ve had a few friends test positive for Covid, I purposely high fived them, gave them hugs and even sit and watched movies with one.</p>
<p>And guess what? <strong>I’m perfectly healthy and never once got sick.</strong></p>
<p>So do us all a favor, take your lying ass down to the hospital, get the vaxx and slowly die off for all of humanities sake. Oh, I been to hospitals also and not a single damn thing going on there.</p>
<p>As for quarantine areas, yeah.. I could imagine them full... Full of healthy people that got false positives on the corrupt Covid test. Possibly a few with the common cold or flu, nothing more.</p>
<p>Oh, and one last thing. As for your “ virtue mask” <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/face-mask-mandates-seem-to-make-ccp-virus-infection-rates-climb-says-study_3629627.html">https://www.theepochtimes.com/face-mask-mandates-seem-to-make-ccp-virus-infection-rates-climb-says-study_3629627.html</a></p>

        <p>I'll answer for him fuckhead, it's almost like the US has lock downs, so the few places you would need to be at to see them struggling to breathe or collapse would be their homes or quarantine centers, moron. You know anyone who stalks people like that normally to watch if they're collapsing or struggling to breathe? If you're struggling to breathe, you're not going out to go to a restaurant, you're most likely staying in bed because you feel off.  </p>
<p>You high fived them and gave hugs. Uh huh, sure you did. Keep LARPing.  </p>
<p>Oh okay great one, as I say to idiots in the US as well, walk into the fucking emergency rooms, take your cameras our, and start recording. You know that thing in your pocket called a smartphone? It can record and upload things. Please go show us how fake it is.   </p>
<p>Also genius, you can be wary of people in power enjoying their power trip, rushed vaccines etc while acknowledging the severity of a disease, putz.</p>

        <p>I run marathons. If you think working 16 hr shifts is hard, trying running 26 miles (that’s 42 kilometers). If I can run 26 miles, you should be able to do it too without complaining. I also have a PhD. If you think working as a security guard is hard, try six years of intensive grad school. Why aren’t you working as a doctor at this facility and just a security guard? If I can suck it up and abide by the requirements to get my PhD, there’s no reason you shouldn’t be able to do it too.</p>

        <p>I don't think he said it was hard to wear the mask, and how can you compare a full body workout to walking around as a guard with a mask?   </p>
<p>You have a PhD. Did you get it out of a Kelloggs box? You can get a PhD if you give enough money to a uni. What Uni, and what was the dissertation on?  </p>
<p>Um, it's a quarantine facility. Not a hospital.   </p>
<p>I'm not sure how you jump to being able to acquire a PhD to wear a mask and distance when necessary. So if he says you have to follow these guidelines, then he should be forced to study for a PhD through graduate school? Was your PhD in Gender Studies?</p>

        <p>I’m not going to dox myself for you. Nice try though. The point is, what is easy for some people, isn’t always easy for others. I have ptsd which makes it extremely difficult for me to cover my face. For some people, running a marathon or getting a PhD would be more difficult than wearing a mask, for me it is the opposite. It takes all types and just because something isn’t difficult for one person doesn’t mean that’s the case for everybody.</p>

        <p>Lol dox you? Trust me, I don't really care to dox you or anyone. You could of literally given a generic idea of what it was, since you didn't, I'm gonna assume BS. <br>
I'm sorry if you have legit PTSD which somehow prevents you from wearing a mask, but I'm sure that's a small portion of the population, and it was specifically referring to people that use the most absurd reasons.</p>
