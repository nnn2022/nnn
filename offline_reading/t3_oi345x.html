    <strong>I feel like the United States is responsible for the coronavirus</strong>
    <p><p>The fact that most US states have lifted restrictions, mask mandates, banning vaccine passports etc. so early compared to the rest of the world seem very suspicious to me. </p>
<p>Our government has a plan to tighten restrictions and get us locked down again this autumn if the coronavirus cases spike again instead. </p>
<p>The United States always have been a country that wants to rule the world and attack countries that don't comply or murder their leader. The president of Tanzania died after he denied the coronavirus and let people life normally. The president of Haiti is dead now too because he also denied coronavirus and rejected the vaccine. They also unsuccessfully tried to kill Lukashenko or  overthrow him. </p>
<p>I think that it's the US that created the coronavirus to dominate other countries through medicine. The vaccine is an effective way to earn enormous amount of money and they want to vaccinate as much people as possible around the world. They started first with china because they wanted to wreck havoc within their economy. They now will let their people live normally but keep the others dominated.</p></p>

        <p>The US is responsible because UNC et al outsourced their GOF research to labs in China. When the CCP says that the US is responsible for the virus, the CCP is not lying.</p>

        <p>I don’t agree, I think several governments are in on the whole thing. I don’t absolve the US actors, but don’t blame all of us.</p>

        <p>Watch event 2021 by Dr Fleming. It shows all the money, patents, and research the US and China did on gain of function research and than it just happens to break out by a research lab in China and now they suddenly have this amazing, new vaccine!! Follow the $$$. Now, with how other countries are so on board I doubt the US works alone to enforce it...but funding the research to create it? Absolutely.</p>
