        <p>Because of the way they live. India has nowhere near the comfort level of most 1st world countries. The 1st world is passive because theyre so comfortable and will remain passive until that comfort is gone.</p>

        <p>\^\^This x1000.  I don't think Americans realize how privileged we are to shut down the economy for a year for a disease that statistically is only to kill the very elderly or people with extreme comorbidities.  We should absolutely focus resources to protect the vulnerable groups, but that is a very small % of the population, and frankly, someone dying at 80+ is normal, its not some unthinkable tragedy. There's an infinite number of possibilities why someone who is 80+ will die, its because you're body is old and isn't meant to live much longer than 80.  I think most elderly actually get that and opted to make the most of their final years despite covid lockdowns.  I saw a fair share of 70+ year olds giving 0 fucks, smoking and going to bars that ignored lockdown rules.  Meanwhile, millenials (like myself who beat covid in a week) are cowering over something that is less deadly to them than chance of death from auto accidents.   Best of all, were gonna be the ones with the nuked economy in a few years, which is awesome because I was starting to miss the 2008 recession.  </p>
<p>If any 3rd world country to the extreme measures we did there would be far more deaths from starvation and total supply chain breakdown.  However, I'm still worried that even our extreme GDP isn't going to be enough to stop a massive economic correction in the US.</p>

        <p>Money doesn't mean anything if there's nothing to buy.</p>
<p>I wouldn't want to be living in a rich neighborhood a year from now.  I actually feel sorry for those folks too.  Hard times are coming, but it should be fairly quick, just a lot of death and destruction for a few months, nothing people in Iraq or Vietnam or Syria or any of the West's victims haven't experienced for years on end.</p>

        <p>This sums it up......</p>
<p>Revelation 18 King James Version (KJV)</p>
<p>18 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.</p>
<p>2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.</p>
<p>3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.</p>
<p>4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</p>
<p>5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</p>
<p>6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.</p>
<p>7 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</p>
<p>8 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</p>
<p>9 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,</p>
<p>10 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.</p>
<p>11 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:</p>
<p>12 The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,</p>
<p>13 And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</p>
<p>14 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.</p>
<p>15 The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,</p>
<p>16 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!</p>
<p>17 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,</p>
<p>18 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!</p>
<p>19 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.</p>
<p>20 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</p>
<p>21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.</p>
<p>22 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;</p>
<p>23 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.</p>
<p>24 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</p>

        <p>Religion is just a product of human imagination, nothing more.   </p>
<p>The Bible is just a storybook of myths.  Don’t read into it farther than that.   It doesn’t actually mean or do anything beyond telling you a cool story of people the majority of which might not have even existed in the first place</p>
<p>That said, if I want to be preached to, I’d go to church.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 50:9-31 King James Version (KJV)</p>
<p>9 For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.</p>
<p>10 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>11 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;</p>
<p>12 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</p>
<p>13 Because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</p>
<p>14 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the Lord.</p>
<p>15 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the Lord: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.</p>
<p>16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.</p>
<p>17 Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.</p>
<p>18 Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.</p>
<p>19 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.</p>
<p>20 In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.</p>
<p>21 Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the Lord, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.</p>
<p>22 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.</p>
<p>23 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</p>
<p>24 I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the Lord.</p>
<p>25 The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.</p>
<p>26 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.</p>
<p>27 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.</p>
<p>28 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance of his temple.</p>
<p>29 Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>30 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>31 Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord God of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.</p>

        <p>I don't think the author was trying to be metaphorical.  It would be far more convincing had they referenced nations that had yet to exist fighting over lands that were yet discovered and had detailed descriptions of the weapons used and the rulers involved.  This should be trivial for a being that knows everything about everything past present and future no?  The problem with "prophecy" is that it is never specific enough to make it falsifiable.  Unfalsifiable claims are nonsense.</p>

<p>Though she mounts up to heaven </p>
<p>Jeremiah 51:53-57 King James Version (KJV)</p>
<p>53 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the Lord.</p>
<p>54 A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:</p>
<p>55 Because the Lord hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:</p>
<p>56 Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the Lord God of recompences shall surely requite.</p>
<p>57 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts.</p>

        <p>no its not a viable excuse. If you mean a viable excuse in the sense that they don't deserve to be beaten for telling someone to put a mask on, sure. But it's not an excuse to enforce it in the first place. Any employee  who insists on enforcing masks or any other bullshit, mostly comes down to their personal opinion on the matter.</p>

        <p>I think that's a good point, it depends on what it is.  Asking someone to wear a piece of cloth cuz your boss said so because insurance and/or the licensing board is on his ass, is not at all the same as some cop beating someone or someone trying to poison you.  Either way I don't condone violence of actually injuring another other than for very obvious self defense but you'd be more justified to take more forceful action in some situations than others.</p>

        <p>I feel you brother, most people are sick of this shit. But violence should be the last resort. You'd be amazed how many times a calm word and a calm demeanor can help a person open their eyes (internet not included). I dont know what's happening in india, so maybe it turning to violence means they are on the last resort  due to whatever is going on there.</p>

<p>I am with you that we shouldn't stoop to their level; I don't wish death on the vaxxies, and I try not to look down on them.  They're victims, and mostly I feel sorry for them.  If they start forcing or compelling people to take the devil venom, it may be necessary to make them feel threatened.  It would be self defense in that case IMO.</p>

        <p>I have to agree with the other person, we should not condone violence, especially on a person physically.  I can understand the people being angry but we should not encourage any violence other than really clear self defense.  Although frankly it looks more like they were just trying to scare those workers out of town without really doing any major injury other than to the truck.  THey could have easily dragged those peeps out of the truck and beaten them but they just flailed a  stick kinda half ass until the guy took off running.  Then one guy half ass chased him and the rest just kinda watched.</p>

        <p>Well, the video is missing context and since I don't speak the language, I can't translate to identify if there is any context. However, if one chooses to be a minion of the current powers, then they also must accept the consequences, and ignorance is no excuse. "MSM and my boss tells me I'm saving lives, and since I refuse to think for myself so I don't come to the realization of what this is really all about, I'm just doing my job"...Sorry, this doesn't cut it..</p>
<p>I am by far an advocate of violence, but when words fail, sometimes good people are left no choice but to stand up and defend themselves through whatever means.</p>

        <p>I read through and seems like that is what "doing his job" entailed, revoking ration cards if you refuse the vaccine. That's not a job, that's mercenary work. He's condemning innocent people to a very high probably of death for the sake of doing his job.. </p>
<p>"COVID is very likely not going to have any effect on you, never mind kill you, but if you don't take the vaccine, which may or may not kill you, may or may not cause permanent damage, we will kill you by starving you to death" </p>
<p>The unfortunate thing is until the people are taken seriously enough they will "keep doing their job", consequently far more people will die as collateral damage than any farce of a pandemic. Their means might be subtle and without bloodshed, but the result is the same, they are committing murder. </p>
<p>I am well aware of the problem, violence begets violence, and "civil disobedience" will give them the excuse they need to bring in military support, which will result in even more bloodshed. The answer is too cut the head off the snake, however the snake is well insulated and they have formed a civilian army of believers to buffer them even further. How many innocent lives have to be sacrificed before it is time to mount a serious revolt, one that yes will end in countless lives lost, but if the head of the snake can be severed then would this not be worth the sacrifice, a chance at rebuilding the right way, or do we completely forgo that chance, lie down and let them completely destroy humanity and ignore the collateral damage as long as we are not affected directly. </p>
<p>It is a conundrum and no hard feelings, I know where you are coming from,  I have just witnessed up close and personal the lives lost and  devastation that this last year has caused so I have little empathy left for these enforcers, advocates and followers.</p>

        <p>True, maybe he really is just doing his job. But since he willfully chose a job in wich he represents the authority on the monopoly of violence, he can expect violence comming back his way. In other words: Being attacked is part of his job.</p>

        <p>Walmart employees don't represent the monopoly on violence. — What i'm stating is that a police officer chose to do a job in wich it is expected of him to fight. He willfully does a job in wich violence is required, so that means on some level he does it because he wants to fight. Walmart employees on the other hand didn't chose a fighters job. So no, we shouldn't beat the shit out of them.</p>

        <p>Never said he isn’t allowed to say something like that. People can and do say whatever they want. Just that it’s unfortunate that things like that are acceptable. Someone was “rightfully beaten” for driving a van. Have a nice night.</p>

        <p>Right. That’s why saying he’s being “rightfully beaten”... for what? No context. Condemning someone to violent punishment based on no evidence, no proof. </p>

        <p>Very few people anywhere know what is going on in their countries. India is, like USA, one of the countries where these globalist health bodies, organizations, bankers, and plutocratic rich bastards have massive power. </p>
<p>It is shocking to imagine, but in India the stupid 'liberal' [actually globalist neocolonialists] actually have a BLM like organization creating strife between Hindus and Muslims as a way to also then insist on widespread globalist changes.</p>
<p>It is happening all over the world - the same clique of globalist supervillains are making their move. Truly historic times.</p>
<p>People have no willingness to discuss this in even remotely realistic terms such as 'complete end of western social contracts', or 'global financial system enacting an IMF\WTO style economic hitjob on western countries as they enact the UN 'Sustainable Development' roadmap to technocratic tyranny'.</p>
<p>No one has any idea, at all, wtf is going on. The only normies who even know the right terms to look into learned them from articles spinning anyone looking into those terms as being a right-wing terrorist or some sort of anti-vaxxer, or whatever. </p>
<p>Given the nature of those inflicting this world-wide change to openly dystopian evilness, I fully expect some sort of mass culling to begin. Maybe multiple overlapping mass cullings.</p>

        <p>They are, but its the same as here. The MSM and virtually anyone with any resources is on the side of globalism. The rich upper class indians all have slave-like servants, but spend half their time virtue signaling western style SJW bullshit and henpecking the indian working class.</p>
<p>younger, potentially upwardly mobile indians are in the same position of western youth: if you support natioanlism at all you are called a nazi and shunned from upwardly mobile society.</p>
<p>There is 13 million modern slaves in india - workers who have had their freedom of movement removed - or sex workers, many child sex prostitutes. Very bleak that globalism means those problems which were once at the forefront of liberal global discussion are now completely accepted under globalism, which appears to support developing world slavery and probably intends to bring it to USA.</p>

<p>I don't know what is happening in India, I think economically the situation is far different, but you can see that from the point of view of a youngish westerner, we have been abandoned completely by globalism, and now are being subjected to racial dehumanization.</p>
<p>It is controversial, but personally I consider what is being done to be overt Genocide of the western civilization.</p>

        <p>Maybe it's Karma for the passive acceptance of your pedo western rulers.
What is the excuse of the westerners regarding the 1 million victims in the war in Iraq, a war based on a false flag and lies?</p>

        <p>Thanks for this massively insightful comment. It puts into perspective why I can barely understand wtf is going on politically and socially in my own country even though I live in it. It's like everyone is plugged into a different maniacal narrative (likely via those handy "recommender algorithms" built into every single platform we interact with) designed to steer us into being confused and mad enough to be at each others' throats for a while, not enough to commit significant violence but enough to need some sort of savior force to put us back on the "right track".<br>
I suppose a lot of bases need to be covered if society is to be reset. I only hope we also have enough time to get organised and act. It seems like many of us are starting to recognise the shadows in this cave for what they truly are.</p>

        <p>R/India is an exception because most folks who post in it are not from india. They're mostly 1st and 2nd generation kids of Indian origin folks who are born and raised in western countries. They bring shit toxic left and identity politics culture to r/India subreddit and try to force-fit it to a Indian setting even though it doesn't apple for india at all( in no uniform policy applies to whole of India as whole, it is extremely diverse in terms of language , culture,religion, cuisines, weather and topography. Any policy needs to carefully modified depending upon the region in which they're implemented).</p>

        <p>I think the real conversation should be oriented around lockdowns. They're pseudo science and have done so much more harm than good (if any good at all).</p>
<p>Even if vaccines are 100% safe and effective, herd immunity can also be acheived organically. Herd immunity is an inevitable phenomenon, not a goal. It's up to each individual to decide to risk the effects of the vaccine or risk of contraction and effects of virus.</p>

        <p>Economically and in terms of health problems that aren’t covid, yes they’ve fucked things up, but when they’ve been implemented they HAVE slowed the spread quite considerably, at least here in the UK. I actually think people at risk should just shield and everyone else should go about their business but it’s not up to me.</p>

        <p>Right but that was exactly the point. The government intentionally created fake narratives to pit people against each other, distracting them from the true enemy. Instead, here were are pretending to fight against “racism” in America and “hate crimes” against Asians and last but not least, conservatives- the deplorables. It’s all fiction but too many sheep buy right into it. </p>

        <p>That's true that the government has done all that but its disappointing how easily brainwashed many Americans are.  I have always been curious by nature and my home was destroyed in a hurricane just 3 years ago and it created alot of problems in my life. So my survival instincts were quickly re-activated.  It amazes me how many people lack survival instincts.  I felt something was off when we were told we didn't need masks and then they made masks mandatory.  I had this bad feeling of just sheer fear. I didnt know at that time why but I knew something was off and I started searching and seeking answers and I found them. But so many ignore their instincts and just go along with their day in denial.</p>

        <p>If something feels off, then it almost always is. Especially right now, this vaccine getting pushed onto ppl, commercials and constant media trying to “encourage” ppl to get vaccinated and then the censorship or cancellation of people discussing anything against the narrative. It’s eerie.</p>
<p>Edit to add: It seems as though the ~~government~~ media is now encouraging bullying against unvaccinated people. Wild times.</p>

        <p>Ok so the stories are that the govt in India is force vaccinating people and denying ration cards if you don't, that's why they are fighting back.  All the guns we have here are probably why they are NOT doing that here to start with.</p>

        <p>Jesus. Is this how far we’ve come? Jealous of India?! What about the age old “if you don’t like America, why don’t you leave” trope? Go live in India for a year and let us know how it was. And BTW when you go over there you’ll probably need a vaccine to even live in that country for a week</p>

        <p>You just accused a vaccine of being a tool to commit genocide, this isn’t vaccine scepticism this is complete ignorance of all science and morality and institutions which, time and time again, have protected humanity from the exact thing you’re fearful of. If we’d had vaccinations during the great plagues they wouldn’t be some of the most famed near-extinction events in modern human history.</p>

<p>They don’t give a fuck about you and since most people like Bill Gates are also into Eugenics, they probably hope you fucking die too. </p>
<p>If you want to make it far in this world you have to understand “secondary motives” most people ain’t even heard of that concept and must think these people are the second coming of Christ. </p>

        <p>It's not uncommon that India public medicine is tampered with. They pharma distributors are known to substitute placebo or half dosing, or even actual poison. If it happens once, it's 10 times more likely to happen again. 100 times when it's forced against your will.</p>

        <p>Do you realize you're rationalizing. One of the 10 defense mechanisms in psychology. You're experiencing cognitive dissonance. Hear me out, maybe just maybe the virus is so scary, that the people aren't afraid to go out and protest, maybe just maybe hunger poverty and homelessness is scarier than the virus. As an European, if the virus was scary, people WOULDN'T want to leave their homes, just like during the bubonic plague, you wouldn't need to force people to stay home. Go suck an authoritarian dick and piss right off.</p>

<p>Search on b**chute "India" and then sort by "new".</p>
<p>I can't link them, but here are a couple titles:</p>
<p>"INDIA - IN SOME PARTS PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED TO TAKE THE VACCINE AGAINST THEIR WILL"</p>
<p>"VILLAGERS IN INDIA FIGHTING COVID RESTRICTIONS"</p>
<p>"INDIA'S B.S PANDEMIC EXPOSED! [MIRRORED]"</p>
<p>"INDIA DOESN'T WANT THE DEATH VAX"</p>
<p>(Translation in the comments of this last video: They were forcing her get vaccine or you will not get ration card renewed ( used to get subsidized food for poor people ) She replied said If God wishes i will die by his will and not by your poison injection )</p>

<p>What’s that? People with maybe a very basic education don’t trust their sleazebags leaders who get fat off of money designated to make their dysfunctional cities function?

        <p>Agreed.  </p>
<p>We decided to invest in the security apparatus rather than our third world health care system.  </p>
<p>Half the country is peaking through the blinds, terrified of their neighbors, spurned into hysteria and delusion.</p>
<p>Of course any of the negative side effects in society can be blamed on COVID, but not the mass detentions, the forced closures, the arbitrary new policies coming out every week.</p>
<p>The national motto might as well be "at least we're not Americans," which ironically enough, is driven by the opportunity to read and see the self-criticism of Americans.  Meanwhile our internal discourse is driven by nonsense like "Why Vancouver is the most livable city in the world."</p>
<p>It's only pathetic at this point.  I used to think we could blame Ottawa and the know-nothings in the provincial capitals, but honestly, it's the rest of us too.</p>

        <p>Haha I saw :</p>
<p>"It's safe, look here is the test data, all the other countries checked it and agreed that it's perfectly good."</p>
<p>"Some of the data seems inconclusive... You mind doing the tests locally so we can verify the results ourselves?"</p>
<p>"Dude, why are you... We did a nationwide test in Israel and they agreed to classify the results so they can't report any problems if they find any. What gives you the balls to question the experimental injections we sell you? Screw this, we don't need a billion people market..."</p>
<p>Sure, doesn't sound at all like they've got something to hide. When you give zero guarantees and refuse any independent testing, that just screams confidence.</p>
<p>Then again they accepted all the other vaccines, so maybe the bribes weren't high enough.</p>

        <p>Let's explore this topic. If we were an authoritative government would we genocide the obedient citizens or the non-obedient citizens? If we were to select for population traits that keep us in power, would we shave off gullible/loyal types or skeptical/rebellious types? Should we reduce the amount of citizens that trust us or the amount of citizens who don't trust us?</p>

        <p>You know I watched a doctor who came onto another doctor's show to talk about the situation in India.  He made the comment that they were seeing a lot of people who had been vaccinated in the hospital.  Of course, they are trying to vax everyone right now, so it's hard to say if it's just because they got infected while waiting in the lines.  I could see the association though leading to extra stress and chaos.</p>

        <p>Yes. India is facing alot of problems right now (hunger, lockdowns, 50 degrees heat wave,  vaccines, lack of oxygen from month ago as it is not related to covid19 explosion). Just one thing is for sure .. the media is lying because it has been proven in two previous posts .. media using pictures and videos from 1 year ago to scare us.</p>

        <p>Yep, and so when on top of all of that, people still die after getting the shot, it's no wonder why the Indian people are responding so strongly.  Maybe the shot is causing some deaths, but even if it's just a straw that broke the camel's back or associated by proximity, it's something to rally around and against to them.</p>
<p>Such a high population density place with a big gap between haves and have nots will also lead to problems.  The guy also mentioned how the poor there have been dying in droves for a year, but now the middle class are just being impacted, so I'm sure that's also leading to the escalation of troubles.</p>

        <p>Yes, they are just used as a pawn in this global control madness, just like they used China to start the 'pandemic', tho nothing that happened in China proved to be real. The way i see it and it`s easy to explain. Even tho india did not use the modified mRNA vaccines, they still have the spike protein in them.A scientific study published 1 day ago, proves that spike protein is enough to kill someone, you dont even need to have anything else, just that, as it damages your blood vessels. So .. 'bad' blood vessels + heat = ? </p>
<p>This could be totaly unrelated, as i mentioned, there are alot of other health problems that can kill you there and RT-PCR tests are 95 % unreliable (? there was a post about this, not sure if i got the percent right but it`s close).</p>

<p>Revelation 13:13-17 King James Version (KJV)</p>
<p>13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,</p>
<p>14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</p>
<p>15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</p>
<p>16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:</p>
<p>17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</p>

<p>Cops got beaten up because they tried to stop a local festival for which thousands of people had gathered during a weekend shutdown (lockdown). Interestingly, the official rules only ask businesses to be shut down, but that doesn’t stop cops from beating people up in any gatherings.</p>

        <p>Posted a video yesterday from Dehli, with someone filming an empty crematorium despite what media was showing, if you check my profile.That had subs also and proven to be actual. So i went with this one also, as we get so lttle news from there, but made sure to say that it needs further investigation.</p>
