    <strong>Parents and Vaccine Talk</strong>
    <p><p>Now that my parents are in panic mode cause they both are just glued to MSM, now came the pressure to get the jab.</p>
<p>The thing was I was actually on board with getting the jabs later on. The interesting part was when I told them I wanted to get the J&amp;J cause I usually trusted traditional vaccines. I even talked a bit with my doctor who said it was a good choice. The wierd part was now they both demand me to get the Pfizer shot. They keep going on about "the blood clots" even though only a few people have actually had that issue and it was people who were much older.</p>
<p>My dad won't stop going on about the jab cause "India" and now "Taiwan 30 people died". I gdt the feeling my dad's just repeating CNN at this point. Anytime I bring up my reasons it gets met with "So you want to kill other people"? He keeps saying to gdt it cause "sure you could get covid but at least you wont die".</p>
<p>My mom is just full on the Pfizer train. Her reasoning is that Pfizer works with the government which means you ca totally trust them. Also "new mrna technology" just sounds cool to her. She opposed my decision for J&amp;J cause of the blood clot reason and "what if you have problems when your older". She just seems to have really surface reasons for Pfizer. She says its cause its more popular (cause its the only vaccine kids can take if they want to go back to school). Also cause "Pfizer has more funding so they can develop medical advancements faster than other companies."</p>
<p>All this has just made my mind go in circles. And to top it all off since I'm in California, our "well-loved and universally praised" governor said that if even 1 person in a company is not vaccinated then everyone has to wear a mask (which totally isn't peer pressure).</p></p>

        <p>“Pfizer works with the government which means you can totally trust them....” If you’re a minor, file immediately for minor emancipation and leave that crazy train. No one with sanity has ever uttered the words “they work with the government so it’s completely trustworthy.” But if your of age, it’s up to you, I also live in Cali, and I’m not getting any jab, injection, or shot they try to give me. Also, our governor is not “loved and universally praised.” That’s why he is facing a recall election this fall.</p>

        <p>JJ is not traditional either and also has a replicating spike protein just like the mRNA vaccines. If you want a more traditional one, wait for novavax</p>

        <p>Ask them if they eventually want grandkids. Ask them if they will pay for you to freeze some eggs or sperm. It may take a while to collect enough (particularly if you're a woman), so perhaps it will be end-of-year before you can take the shot.</p>

        <p>Well, our lord and Savior trump said that we shouldn't trust no government. They stole the election! So you should just wait it out until he is re-presidented on the 12th of August. </p>
<p>You got this little buckaroo. I'm sure your middle school science class taught you enough to be smarter than any parental!</p>
