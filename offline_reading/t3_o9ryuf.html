        <p>All of the heavy lifting in improved health through the years has been done by the water and sewer operators and the garbage collectors, NOT the doctors, and not their chemical treatments.</p>
<p>From <em>The Questionable Contribution of Medical Measures to the Decline of Mortality in</em><br>
<em>the United States in the Twentieth Century - John B. McKinlay; Sonja M. McKinlay (link below)</em></p>
<p>"Rather more conservatively, if we attribute some of the subsequent fall in the</p>
<p>death rates for pneumonia, influenza, whooping cough, and diphtheria to medical measures, then perhaps 3.5 percent of the fall in the overall death rate can be explained through medical intervention in the major infectious diseases considered here. Indeed, given that it is precisely for these diseases that medicine claims most success in lowering mortality, 3.5 percent probably represents a reasonable upper-limit estimate of the total contribution of medical
 measures to the decline in mortality in the United States since 1900."</p>

        <p>Modern medicine outside of trauma medicine is a fucking joke. I agree with this dude…don’t take the medicine. Medications stop symptoms. Symptoms are not caused by a disease, symptoms are the cure to dis-ease. </p>
<p>Symptoms are created by our own body to get rid of toxins and dead cell debris(viruses). It’s the body’s way of correcting itself. If you stop your body from getting rid or all that shit, it accumulates, and that’s what causes real problems to occur.</p>

<p>This may surprise you, but our knowledge of health has increased over the past century.  We even know about the existence of viruses now.  In general, we have a functional understanding of how they spread and also how to reduce or even prevent their spread.</p>

        <p>The irony is killing me. Do you realize our entire covid response is based on bludgeoning the public with dogmatism, while burying any relevant medical truths?   All I can conclude is that you watch too much TV, and must believe everything you see on it. There’s a reason they call it “programming”</p>

        <p>For what it's worth, I don't watch TV at all and I don't recommend anyone else does either.</p>
<p>One of my friends unexpectedly turned into a anti-vaxxer to due gross misinformation, perhaps even the same you reference.  I've clicked every link he's sent me.  I've read AFDS's outdated garbage.  I've heard the cringey and factually incorrect talk from Dr. Gold.  I've watched Highwire's hilariously confused second-hand interview with Dr. Bossche.  While I'm sure Dr. Bossche was acting out of best intentions, he's nevertheless been proven wrong by his own prophecies.</p>
<p>At this point, some 8ish months after the initial vaccinations, and now with millions and millions of people vaccinated, I don't see it valuable to debate anti-medical position of anti-vax doomsayers.  The results speak for themselves.  Open your eyes to this!</p>
<p>Not only is the mRNA vaccine extremely effective, but the remarkable technique is right now in this moment being actively explored for treatments and prevention of cancers, HIV, flu, ebola, zika, rabies, and more.  (Citations available upon request.)</p>
<p>One of these days you're going to wake up and realize this global conspiracy fever dream was a waste of time and effort.  I sincerely hope this happens before you spread the disease to someone you love.</p>

If you act and talk like a pfizer salesman while they aren’t paying you, then maybe you have internalized the propaganda and need treatment to get out of the cult you’re in.

        <p>My anti-vax friend didn't have the disease either.  Until he did, and his whole family got it with him.</p>
<p>But in fact covid is not the only disease you are at risk of spreading.  You have been infected by a cult of ignorance, where incredulity is the sovereign currency.  Challenges to pre-conceived conclusions are either dismissed without engagement or else belligerently mocked.  Traditionally, this develops into a paranoia as you realize that the entire world must be wrong and only you and your buddies have the truth.  Smaller conspiracy theories will begin to cascade into larger ones, and if you're not careful, you'll find yourself sincerely wondering if all the human around you are soulless reptilian androids or just p-zombie slaves.</p>

<p>The crazy stuff here, is what you think I believe.  Your conspiratorial imagination of how unhinged a person must be just to be hesitant about an unproven experimental vaccine is ridiculous.  I'm a vaccine safety advocate. It's that simple.  You are a dangerous experimental drug pusher - you don't agree with informed consent, and you endorse human experimentation against the Geneva Convention.</p>

        <p>Vaccine safety advocate?  To "educate the masses to not take medicine"?</p>
<p>If it were just me pushing for experimental therapy, you would have a valid point.  Sure would be weird for some rando on the internet to cheer on a weird and new and scary-sounding medical technique and push it on everyone.  But that's not what's happening, is it?  It's not just some hiveminded reddit users "endorsing human experimentation against the Geneva Convention."</p>
<p>I'm also not sure why you think it's unproven with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/recent-u-s-covid-19-deaths-have-been-largely-among-the-unvaccinated-says-new-analysis-01624615932">results like this</a>.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, back in November I certainly wouldn't have wanted to be the first in line to get the vaccine.  I'm not saying uneducated skepticism is automatically justified, just that it is understandable.  But we're way past that now.  The vaccine isn't killing people, or sterilizing them, or altering their DNA, or turning them into virus shedding machines, or any of the other nonsense that anti-vax doomsayers claimed.  It's time to move on.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason I bring up the warning about conspiracy theory cascade is because I've witnessed it happen.  Don't let it happen to you!</p>

        <p>Your USA Today headline is not compelling.  </p>
<p>There is no amount of argument that can change my mind.  Show me the data.  Until the medical establishment comes clean about the safety and efficacy of the product, there is no debate, just propaganda and the truth-seekers who refute it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be honest about the harms caused by the vaccine - the number of injuries and deaths from the jab is worrisome, and underreported by at least 10X.</li>
<li>Be honest about the fact that the jab does not prevent infection, and does not prevent transmission.  It may provide these results based on reduced severity, but that's not a vaccine, is it?  That's an alternative to Tylenol.</li>
</ol>
<p>Without proper statistics on vaccine harms, one can't properly assess the pros and cons of natural infection versus the pros and cons of getting the vaccine.  If one can't compare these risks and come to their own conclusion, then there is no informed consent, and thus, crimes against humanity are being committed.  </p>
<p>The default position is unjabbed, not the other way around.  The burden of proof is on the pro-vaxxers to back up their ludicrous claims of safety and efficacy that are daily proven to be fantasies of wishful thinking about medical miracles.</p>

        <p>Holy shit! Is there a piece of propaganda that you won't endorse?  This is the condensed data sheet.  1. It's not the vaccine insert paperwork (the one all vaccines require). 2. It doesn't list the potential side effects.</p>
<p>Since you won't listen to reason (that is unbiased by big pharma $$), just know this.  I and billions like me, will not even consider the vax until it's actually approved by the FDA (It's not now, and will never be - the safety profile is atrocious).</p>

        <p>I take it you didn't notice the other links.  Reddit doesn't make it easy to distinguish when they're lined up, so I won't blame you for that.  Here's a direct link: https://data.cdc.gov/browse?q=covid&amp;sortBy=last_modified</p>
<p>Just to clarify, you're telling me that when the vaccine goes through the normal (justifiably slow) FDA approval process, you'd be all for it.  Is that right?  As I mentioned earlier, the mRNA technique is being explored for a host of other treatments and cures.  It's reasonable to assume that in the future the FDA will approve some of them. Will you be okay with that?</p>
<p>By the way, I have to say, it looks bad when your two posts contain these two sentences:
&rt;There is no amount of argument that can change my mind. Show me the data.</p>
<p>and</p>

<p>Be honest, you don't care about the data.  You don't believe the official data, and as you've just stated you don't have any alternative data.  One would be forced to conclude you're making claims without any data at all.  For example, "the safety profile is atrocious," you and I both know there's nothing behind that assertion.  But as you say, nothing - not argument, not data - is going to change your mind.  Be careful about that.</p>

        <p>What is the utility of that link?  It tells how many people died of covid, and how many got the vax.  No link between the two.  People are dying post-vax - these people are not dying from Covid - the vaccine is part of the equation, but every headline says it's rare rare rare.  But there's a new one every day.  Seems it's not so rare.</p>
<p>&rt;when the vaccine goes through the normal (justifiably slow) FDA approval process, you'd be all for it. Is that right?</p>
<p>Wrong.  It means that after FDA approval, I'll apply the pros and cons to my own personal Covid risk matrix and decide for myself if I will benefit from the jab.  It's really that simple.  I'm leaning towards NO, because my own covid risk is so small, that there may be no benefit to the vaxxine.  </p>
<p>&rt; It's reasonable to assume that in the future the FDA will approve some of them. Will you be okay with that?</p>
<p>I don't care.  They approved Vioxx and other drugs.  Their approval means something, but one thing it doesn't mean is that a product is safe and effective.  What it means is that the hurdles to approval have been hopped through. Case in point, vioxx and dozens of other drugs that seem to have been approved prematurely, and once the real world (as opposed to lab world) data came out, it turns they were dangerous and should never have been approved.</p>
<p>&rt;By the way, I have to say, it looks bad when your two posts contain these two sentences:</p>
<p>There is no amount of argument that can change my mind. Show me the data.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>nope, I just read the data, and continue not to be moved by it.</p>
<p>Argument is just naysaying - no amount of it will change my stance, but compelling data will.  As to the last part, your data was not compelling.  It's that simple.</p>
<p>&rt;You don't believe the official data</p>
<p>No fucking way.  The official data wants to say nobody has ever been harmed by this mRNA vaccine.  VAERS says otherwise, but it's not official.  So I don't believe the official data because I know it's cooked, and you don't believe the VAERS data because it supposedly anecdotal.</p>
<p>I'm not necessarily opposed to the jab, but I know it's not for me.  Tell me what's so bad about just getting covid, or not (only 10% of the US has had it, including all of the false positive PCR tests), and getting on with life.  If you mention spreading a disease I don't have to a hypothetical person, I quit.</p>

        <p>You say "show me the data", but you don't trust the data.</p>
<p>You say "until it's actually approved by the FDA", but you don't care about what the FDA approves.</p>
<p>Bad news about your other argument: VAERS shows that the vaccine is safe.  Is it statistically <em>perfectly</em> safe?  No, nothing is perfect.  Is it statistically safer than the risk of covid?  Yes and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html">by a lot</a>.  But I know you're going to ignore that, too, because it doesn't fit your conspiracy theory.  (And/or you think you're invulnerable, but I don't want to assume too much.)</p>
<p>VAERS is managed by the CDC and FDA.  I don't know who told you it was unofficial or anecdotal, but you need to realize you've been lied to.</p>
<p>You say you "know" that the official data is cooked, but that is a bold claim that you cannot epistemologically defend.  How do I know you cannot defend it?  Because you have no data!  And do realize that it's not just one company or one nation making these claims.  Your line of reasoning <em>requires</em> a world-wide conspiracy of massive scale.  Beware of where this takes you.</p>
<p>As for what's so bad about catching covid, I don't think there's anything I can tell you.  You've already been informed, and you refuse the warnings.  You don't believe what you don't want to believe, and you don't care if other people catch it.  Like I said before, I sincerely you don't spread the disease to someone you love.</p>

        <p>&rt;Like I said before, I sincerely you don't spread the disease to someone you love.</p>
<p>You're literally unbelievable.  Like I said before, I don't have covid, so how could I pass it on?  Tell me about how catching a case is a death sentence*, yet the survivability is over 99%.   *and therefore I should surrender my corpus to the pharma gods for the unproven salvation of the vaccine (which has caused several peoples' skins to fall off - a fate worse than the dreaded covid).</p>
<p>&rt;VAERS shows that the vaccine is safe.</p>
<p>Explain to me how VAERS shows it's safe, when VAERS clearly shows it's more dangerous than all previous vaccines, combined.</p>
<p>&rt;VAERS is managed by the CDC and FDA. I don't know who told you it was unofficial or anecdotal, but you need to realize you've been lied to.</p>
<p>It's a smokescreen.  It's voluntary, so it doesn't collect all the injuries.  Doctors are reluctant to report (as my own experience has proven), so however many cases they collect, it's only a fraction of the total - but this allows that they're "doing something."  And each case is not directly, and clinically connected to the vaccine.  . .they allow reporting of things, but while doing so, deny the connection.  The system, by collecting a fraction, and being anecdotal in nature, allows them to both claim the number of adverse events is low, and also to deny the cases they do collect as not really meaningful.  The plan was created by the vax companies themselves as part of the 1986 vaccine act - they wrote their own hall pass.  Every company making these vaxxines is already a convicted mass murderer (except Moderna?), but they're used to getting away with it, and will continue to do so, thanks to support by folks like yourself.</p>
<p>Riddle me this. . why would I replace the hypothetical risk of maybe catching covid, and maybe getting sick, and almost definitely being just fine, with getting the jab and playing russian roullette with an unknown safety profile, for no benefit with respect to my covid outcome?  Why would I swap a known very small risk for an unknown risk that may be nothing, but may be far worse than anything the small risk could represent?  Clear headed people, who are risk averse, are not getting the vaccine.  Fear headed people, who are statistically illiterate, are lining up in droves to be injected with an experiment an a parking lot behind a stadium.  You seem smart enough to be able to see the fuckery that's going on.  You also seem thick headed enough to continue to support it.</p>
<p>&rt;Your line of reasoning requires a world-wide conspiracy of massive scale. </p>
<p>Have you heard of The Great Reset?  It's not a conspiracy THEORY if there's a book by Klaus Schwab, a documentary, a website, G7 meetings, etc etc etc.  It's a real conspiracy, and we're in the midst of it.  Conspiracies are true.  Theories are theoretical.</p>

        <p>Regarding statistics, since you don't trust any data, since you "know" that all the official data is cooked, since you "know" all the contraindications are a smokescreen, there's no way to make a proper risk assessment, is there?  Much less discuss it.  But more seriously...</p>

<p>Please take my warning in earnest.  Make a calendar alert for yourself a year from now to see where you are with this idea.  Just as a kind of sanity check-in.  You have nothing to lose, right?</p>

<p>Are you with the FBI? Fuck off.</p>
<p>I didn't say I don't trust any data, but I'm glad you mention contraindications.  It's unethical to attempt to vaccinate every human without considering them, which you haven't.  They exist, but there is no informed consent when all of the public is being told, via propaganda, to get the vax, and legitimate reasons not to are not discussed by each and every person with their own familiar medical advisor before enrolling themselves in the experiment.  What you are advocating are crimes against humanity.  I do not need a sanity check to know whether opposing that is the right thing to do.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: when I got the vaccine, I was given paperwork explaining contraindications, shown a list of allergies and medications that might cause problems, and then verbally asked to confirm the same information.</p>
<p>In fact, I still have the printout here.  Let's see, it gives a list of situations like allergies or medicines that affects immune system that you need to speak up about before you get the vaccine.  In fact, it explicitly says not to get the vaccine if you've had severe allergic reactions to any of the ingredients, which it lists out.  It states the purported benefit.  It gives a list of risks, including nausea, lymphadenopathy, and various allergic reactions.  It gives the website for VAERS for reporting anything.  The FDA status is clearly stated and it briefly describes the emergency use authorization.  It even discusses the countermeasures injury compensation program. Oh, and there is a website listed for this document.  I should have started there.</p>
<p>If you want to read it, it was very similar to <a href="https://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=14472&amp;format=pdf">this PDF</a>, but an older version.  If you were to walk up to a vaccine site to get the Pfizer shot, you'd be given all that information.</p>
<p>So yeah, everything you stated was wrong.  Who is giving you this information?</p>
<p>Also, you did state you didn't trust official data, and that you had no alternative data, so that does suggest you don't trust any data.  But maybe I missed the nuance.  What data do you trust?</p>

        <p>It’s not anti medicine, but anti over medication. It is an effective back up solution when all else fails, but over medication and mixing incompatible medication is a genuine problem and ideally you should lead with diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes rather than trying to find the correct mix of chemicals.</p>
