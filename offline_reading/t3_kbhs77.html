<title>COVID has eradicated the Flu! San Diego County is reporting 39 flu cases this year, compared to 20,000 last year. Dr. Wilma Wooten said it's because "people are wearing masks." But despite everyone wearing masks, our coronavirus cases continue to increase.</title>

        <p>Doctors, no less. I already didn't think very highly of them (relative to the common man), but this whole 'pandemic' has fully established for me what uncritical Big Pharma robots every last one of them is.</p>
<p>And the worst part is, even if this somehow magically goes away, we'll still be forced to wear masks if not all the time, then at least during flu seasons, because they've seemingly established how effective they are. Great.</p>
<p>Nevermind that worldwide, they used to just roll their eyes at what the Japanese do, saying it was superstitious and unnecessary, or not primarily for health reasons.</p>
<p>And of course Fauci's own opinion before The Big Turnaround in March ...</p>

        <p>Not a doomer but here‚Äôs my 2 cents: covid is new and no one has immunity. The flu isn‚Äôt new and at any given loping in time some people will have immunity. If you have the flu and then give it to someone who is more immune it won‚Äôt spread any farther. If you have covid  everyone you give it to will catch it. So masks + social distancing + natural immunity would bring the R for the flu lower and it doesn‚Äôt spread. Covid is spreading bc masks + social distancing isn‚Äôt brining the r value below 1. </p>
<p>Hope that cleared it up a bit :)</p>

        <p>And yet I've gone the whole year without catching it. However I was sick in Feb this year. Maybe that was it and now I'm immune. I haven't gotten sick again even going to indoor dining at the places staying open.</p>

        <p>LMFAO my sister‚Äôs explanation was because COVID is more contagious. Please explain the logic in that. On top of that, she‚Äôs a nurse that loves to virtue signal and agrees with the mask mandates, but barely wears it when we‚Äôre out in public and thinks they‚Äôre dumb. Bunch of virtue signaling hypocrites in this world, especially healthcare workers hahaha.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm honestly curious to know who else is with your sister or where is she at when she is agreeing to the mask mandates. Healthcare workers are actually becoming more terrified to speak out against the mandates when around certain people or at certain places because of fears of losing their job. I don‚Äôt know your sister but I‚Äôve just seen that with other health care workers and figured I‚Äôd mention it.</p>

        <p>My logic: Masks are in use, flu is down. Logical conclusion, masks and social distancing are slowing the spread of flu. Covid is high, but likely lower than it would be without those guidelines, which makes sense since they are <em>what has been used around the world to stop the spread of deadly diseases.</em></p>
<p>Your logic: masks don‚Äôt work, we shouldn‚Äôt social distance, flu is down but magically what is working to slow the flu does not work for covid. Flu is worse cuz it kills kids, but I still won‚Äôt wear a mask because of that. </p>
<p>For the life of me I can‚Äôt understand why you find the idea of masks not working so attractive.</p>

        <p>The argument would be more like flu cases are being recorded as covid because the creator of PCR testing said it isn't a diagnostics tool. Take a look at places without all the insane rules like Sweden for example, who are set to have no excess deaths this year with no masks. When mask mandates were enforced in many places, is there any clear drop in the "curve"? Can you disprove the studies which prove masks ineffective such as the Danish mask study?</p>

<p>Sweden‚Äôs average pop density is 25/km, New York is 27,000. Stockholm, most populated city, is 4200, so it isn‚Äôt exactly apples to apples, but go ahead post how the socialist country w socialized medicine and low population density is relevant to places like nyc. </p>
<p>Also, hospitals are full, so are you proposing that not wearing masks or social distancing will lower the number of people in the hospital?</p>

<p>This is an RCT study, which since it's conducted in real life, is of higher quality than an observational or laboratory study. It is the first one to have been conducted specifically on SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>Yes, Sweden has a lower population density. But does the fact that they didn't use the restrictions and <em>nothing</em> happened not ring a bell to you?</p>
<p>And I'm rather tired of the "hospitals are full" argument. At this time if year, they are normally above 80% capacity, and it is not any different this year. Hospitals my family have been to, and people we know work at are not full. And hospitals being full does not justify this treatment of the public. In the 2018 flu season they were very full but that didn't make the news because we just accepted that it happens sometimes. The original lockdown if you remember was to gather resources and prepare hospitals, not a justification to lockdown indefinetly.</p>

        <p>They do help, that‚Äôs the whole point of wearing them. They are not going to solve the problem all by themselves, but they are an important part of the overall guidelines. That is what the CDC says, that is the logic behind responses to viral outbreaks around the world that have been helpful. </p>
<p>Imagine an Ebola outbreak in Africa, and reporters saying ‚Äúdespite multiple different worldwide agencies promoting the use of masks, people in (insert country Trump would call a shithole) still refuse to wear masks. The hospitals are full and over a quarter million people have died, record numbers dying every day, yet they still won‚Äôt wear masks or change their behavior at all, but we <em>have</em> seen a rise in low effort memes on their subreddit.‚Äù Even picture them being ‚Äúlibruls‚Äù or whatever makes it easier, tell me you wouldn‚Äôt roll your eyes and think ‚Äúwell no wonder they are having problems.‚Äù</p>
<p>Imagine going into surgery and the surgeons and nurses and orderly are all like ‚Äúmasks?! Ha ha sheep, next you‚Äôll want us to wash our hands üôÑ‚Äù because they don‚Äôt like being forced to follow the guidelines because it infringes on their rights. </p>
<p>Imagine a guy in a lab studying infectious disease saying ‚Äúmasks? Pfffft, masks don‚Äôt help.‚Äù That‚Äôs what y‚Äôall sound like over here.</p>

        <p>So everyone is wearing masks so it prevents spread of the flu yet nobody is wearing masks so covid cases are rising? </p>
<p>Pick one and stick with it. Either people are wearing masks and it‚Äôs doing nothing for covid or the flu and they‚Äôre just marking flu as covid because it sure as hell didn‚Äôt disappear, or people aren‚Äôt wearing masks thus covid is out of control due to that in which case the flu would be just as high as any other year.

        <p>This is a very interesting paradox. So let's try to be open minded and do a mental experiment. People say that Coronavirus is more contagious than the flu and that should explain the difference in the effects of measures. So far so good. I can even think of an analogy to visualize that, similar to the Swiss cheese model that the doomers like. </p>
<p>Let's imagine our masks, social distancing, and stay at home orders work as a sieve. The flu is too big to go through the pores of the sieve, so it cannot propagate. Coronavirus is smaller, so it manages to go through the pores, and continues to spread. Imagine peas and salt. Salt (Corona) goes through, while peas (flu) gets caught. Sounds logical?</p>
<p>Now the problem above is that we are observing the disappearance of the flu, as well as the spread of Corona, globally. It is well known that different countries, even different states apply vastly different measures. That's equivalent to having sieves with different size holes.</p>
<p>If you've managed to read this far, you should see now where the explanation start to fall apart. The sieves work the same independently of pore size. So in one country the flu is the size of peas, in another it's walnut sized, and in third it's as big as a watermelon.</p>
<p>Does that make sense? A lot less than the initial sieve model, if you ask me.</p>
<p>My alternative suggestion is that none of the public measures make much of a difference, and it is the individual behavior which provides a natural hindrance for viral spread. This individual behavior is consistent across countries because it makes us inevitably self isolate when we are really sick. Most of the time with coronavirus we are not, and then no measures on the level of society help much.</p>

        <p>I had a similar theory at first, but it doesn‚Äôt hold up under more scrutiny.  I can‚Äôt imagine anyone who actually has the flu isn‚Äôt also getting a COVID test, at least for peace of mind.  Yet the extreme majority of all positive tests are coming back COVID.   So we‚Äôre to believe we eradicated the flu in one year (and remember every year there are new strains, this is why people get shots)...because of staying home, masks and social distancing, yet those same measures are proving totally futile when it comes to COVID.  I‚Äôve got a hard time swallowing that.</p>

        <p>Your assumption about influenza and SARS-CoV-2 having equal infectiousness is a little off.</p>
<p>Most people have limited immunity to the flu from past infections. Up until Nov.-Dec. 2019, no one had immunity to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>From the point of view of your body flu is familiar and easily defeated, SARS-CoV-2 is new and scary and dangerous.</p>

        <p>That's not what I am saying. More people get Covid than would have gotten the flu, because it is more infectious and because nobody was immune. Those people stay at home, so they can't get or spread the flu. Both respiratory infections have the same groups of people who are susceptible. In the end covid gets them first and the flu is left without potential carriers. The distancing measures play some limited role as well.</p>

        <p>This entire COVID response has showcased the world's absolute failure to understand effective risk-management.</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone has a risk appetite.  Additional rewards without additional risk are rare arbitrage opportunities, so rewards mostly require taking risks; an organization has to define how much and what kind is acceptable.</li>
<li>Risk mitigation measures have a cost, and completely eliminating a risk is often not worth the cost.  Depending on your risk appetite, it may be more desirable to take a partial measure to head off the worst negative effects of the risk, or not mitigate it at all.</li>
<li>Risks cannot be evaluated in isolation.  Mitigating a risk may introduce other, unseen risks, and you have to identify those and decide whether they, too, are worth their cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>What governments have done with COVID is encourage an unsustainable near-zero risk appetite, ignore the cost entirely, and willfully blind themselves to the additional risks they have introduced.</p>

        <p>There's a type of statistical analysis that involves systematically entering variables into the equation and another that involves just throwing them all in at the same time to see what comes up as correlated/related. What we're doing with this flu/covid issue is the latter - throwing around all kinds of hypotheses without any consideration to falsifying one at a time. We need the former. And we can do it in different orders to evaluate and try to falsify each one. For example, PCR testing, then NPI effects, then contagiousness, then size of the particles. Then start over in a different order. </p>
<p>If someone remembers what these are called I'd love to be reminded.</p>
<p>Just guessing is doing absolutely nothing. We need data and we need good analysis that starts with the scientific principle of falsification.</p>
