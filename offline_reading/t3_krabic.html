    <strong>Spineless cowards.</strong>
    <p><p>Iâ€™ve got a large group of friends, weâ€™re (mostly) all from different ethnic backgrounds, who more or less agree that this whole scenario is batshit insane. I live in Australia, where we have like one case and are required to wear masks everywhere.</p>
<p>I was discussing with my friends in a large group chat (~14 of us) about the reaction people give when telling you to put on the mask. I have some friends who are called out everywhere they go for not wearing the mask. One was even throatened by security to be banned from a shopping centre, the same one I go to 3 x a week without a mask. They are all mostly average height, build, cleanly shaven, â€˜well presentedâ€™, etc. Some of them are even on the goofier side in the way they carry themselves, donâ€™t know how to explain. </p>
<p>I am no mammoth, but I am 6 foot 2, have been lifting for 6+ years, Serbian (Eastern European) with a thick black beard down to the bottom of my neck (another reason why I hate wearing a mask). I have been called out a total of TWO TIMES in months of not wearing a mask. Both times by women in their small businesses - I simply just say no worries and walk out. I wonâ€™t make her life hard, of course - but she wonâ€™t get a dollar out of me. My cousin is a 6â€™6 Serbian-Hercules looking f*cker, top .1% of genetics and personal security for some famous personalities here in Australia. He has never been asked outside of work to put on a mask. Not once. He claims he canâ€™t wait for the day someone asks him to put on a mask, lol ðŸ™„. Also, my girlfriend, who refuses to wear a mask, is also called out here and there when sheâ€™s alone, but NEVER when with me.</p>
<p>This goes to show you the spineless nature of these cowards. They pick and choose who they want to confront. It makes me sick. </p>
