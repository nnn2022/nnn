    <p><p>Who the fuck is going to ENFORCE any of those ‚Äúlaws‚Äù (mandates). If I walk down the street unmasked and cough in your libtarded line of path (or let‚Äôs be extreme, cough purposely on your face), whose going to do anything about it if all u tards got rid of the police??</p>
<p>I‚Äôve actually had a different opinion on it now, of course I‚Äôve always been back the police, but come to think of it, Republicans and other gun owners libertarians or not, have all the means necessary in America to protect and police themselves. I don‚Äôt think these libturds üí© really understand what a completely defunded police country would look like. Antifa isn‚Äôt too terrifying. Homeless people aren‚Äôt too scary. Democratic voting (brainwashed) gangsters are relatively scary but you know what IS terrifying? The 300 million guns that are mainly Republican and libertarian owned.. Thats a pretty big army/police.. Are they sure they want to defund the real police that follows strict guidelines and almost ALL have body worn cameras, in exchange for self-policing Republicans??? Stupid is as stupid does. LiBtaRdS uNiTe!!!</p></p>
