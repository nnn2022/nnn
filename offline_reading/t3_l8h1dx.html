    <strong>Service NSW App - How to appear compliant while protecting your privacy.</strong>
    <p><p>Here in NSW, Australia the government has developed an app called <a href="https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/campaign/service-nsw-mobile-app">Service NSW</a> </p>
<p>The government recommends that people install the app to make it “easy” to check-in and stay “safe”when visiting a <a href="https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/covid-safe/customer-record-keeping/mandatory-electronic-check-in">business, organisation and events that must use electronic check-in. </a> to check in you must provide name and phone number, business name and check in time. They claim your name and phone number is encrypted after they collect it.</p>
<p>For people who are using or considering using this system, it’s important to ask the yourself these three questions. 
1. Where is your contact information being stored?
2. Who has access to the encryption key to decrypt your data?
3. How is your data protected from unauthorised access from malicious government employees or hackers.</p>
<p>If you don’t know the answer to one or more of these questions, I would seriously reconsider providing your real name and phone number.</p>
<p>Remember, this system is fundamentally flawed as there is no requirement for you to prove your name and phone number to the government or the business you are visiting. </p>
<p>It’s a small step you can take to protect your privacy while appearing to be compliant. However, they’ve already suggested that this app could be used to show “vaccination status”.</p>
<p>Stay safe and protect your privacy. It’s the one thing you can control in these dystopian times.</p></p>
