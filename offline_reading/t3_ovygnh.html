    <strong>Drastic increase in sales of cardiomyopathy and anticoagulant drugs from Pfizer in 2021</strong>
    <p><p>Source: <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000078003/9eb81b7a-2ab8-4a1f-bfd2-51e447d5d7e7.pdf">8-k form by Pfizer in Q2 2021</a></p>
<p>Page 5, Quarterly Financial Highlights</p>
<p>“Vyndaqel/Vyndamax (cardiomyopathy treatment drug) globally, up 77% operationally (compared to Q2 of 2020), primarily driven by continued strong uptake of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy indication in the U.S., developed Europe and Japan;</p>
<p>Eliquis (anticoagulant), up 13% operationally, led by growth in the U.S. and emerging markets, driven primarily by continued increased adoption in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and oral anti-coagulant market share gains”</p>
<p>Remember the reports where the NHS <a href="https://yourtenderteam.co.uk/contracts/nhs-framework-agreement-for-the-supply-of-direct-oral-anticoagulants-doacs-for-the-nhs-in-england/">buying £3.2 billion worth of anticoagulants until 2024</a>? Remember that slide in the fda already knowing severe side effects? They’re already preparing for the fallout and ready to scam for more money in their racket</p></p>

        <p>Somebody at a party said "Google, Apple and Facebook are going to run the world".</p>
<p>Pfizer said, "Hold my beer".</p>
<p>This murderous company, headed by a you-know-what-but-we-can't-say, is about to poke and cripple the entire world and then provide the medicine. Oh, you didn't hear about the regime of "anti-virals" they are developing to treat the vaccinated with?!? Oh yeah, Doomers. Wait until they get some good anti-virals pumped into you. Your liver will be turned to liquid and sliding out of your colon in a week. After all, it's just so much fun to "trust the science".</p>
<p>Pfizer is about to become the medical version of Avon. People will be throwing pharmaceutical parties where you can stock up on all the latest vaccines, anti-virals and anti-coagulants from the comfort of your neighbor's living room.</p>
<p>Even the Sun isn't more obvious than this scam, but here we go!</p>
