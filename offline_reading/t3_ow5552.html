    <strong>Long ass rant about a lot of things. We‚Äôre all trapped.</strong>
    <p><p>So I probably repeated this once in the past but because of the Covid bs I decided to take a deeper look in my political stance, especially Covid. Lol I had an idea in mind of what I was gonna say so excuse me if this is just a rambled mess. I look back at myself back then and I was a Covid nut, telling my mom to wear a mask <em>correctly</em> because she had it under her nose or would complain. She‚Äôd also have crazy conspiracy theories that I scoffed at. But I eventually changed my ways once I was out of my comfort zone and realized that you gotta stop worrying about other people and being paranoid and worry about yourself. Ugh I sound like a broken record. I thought I had a point but I don‚Äôt know. </p>
<p>Well, I‚Äôll at least get this off my chest. I did give in and get the vaccine, only because I have a trip I can‚Äôt get a refund for next year in NY and I don‚Äôt want to wear a mask. I basically just want to be left alone and be under the radar because Cuomo is a c*nt and NY gives me anxiety. Yeah I gave in and I hate it and regret it!! I know that they wouldn‚Äôt stop at just Covid. Nooo they had to add the Delta variant. Not just that, vaccinated people are now the carriers. Unvaccinated people are still selfish and carriers too so there‚Äôs nothing new on that end. </p>
<p>But apparently NOBODY‚ÄôS safe from this supposed new variant!!! But I felt icky giving in. It goes against everything I believe in: coercion. I gave in to those pigs. Granted, I didn‚Äôt do it for the fucking donuts or the lottery, but I did it because I know NY‚Äôs more strict and anal than my state so I decided to do the bare minimum. </p>
<p>Well as it turns out, the bare minimum wasn‚Äôt fucking enough so now they want people to get the third shot (totally predictable, not getting it) oh and on top of all that, ALL THREE SHOTS AGAIN!!!! So what‚Äôs the fucking point of the peer pressure this year??! Oh and the news said that they suggest that people mask up again EVEN WHEN VACCINATED!! So again, what was the damn point?!!?! Oh and Disney decided to take like ten steps back after lifting the mandates for like a whole ass month. Hopefully people enjoyed it because the rug got ripped out right under them. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre going back to square one, I know we are, and they want us to. Like how long are we gonna have to deal with this shit?? Wearing masks at the DMV and doctors offices, regardless if you‚Äôre vaccinated or not?? It‚Äôs bullshit and I hate that I gave in!!! I‚Äôm definitely not getting the third shot because fuck that! I did the bare minimum so fuck off and leave me alone!! I‚Äôd gladly give the shot repeatedly to B*den and the other dicks in the government. They can fuck right off!!!</p>
<p>I got the second experimental jab July 16th, I believe and ever since then I‚Äôve been feeling sick. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but it‚Äôs mostly my gag reflexes to where if I brush my teeth or basically just exist, I start to gag and attempt to throw up. In some cases I did, both at work and home. There‚Äôs no other explanation. </p>
<p>A day after the second dose I felt nauseous, then up until now I‚Äôve been having strong urges to throw up. I stand, I feel like throwing up. I bend, I feel like throwing up. I lift something heavy, I feel that urge again. Well today I actually did it. I only ate two things, a snack and mini Pizza Hut pizza. Threw it all up. I ate them at different times too. The snack was in the afternoon (2ish) and the pizza was at 4 or 5ish. I usually have good luck with food so it‚Äôs not food poisoning but it seems like I‚Äôm normal and fine one minute then I‚Äôm sick the next. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm gonna try and go to the doctors again and basically say ‚Äúhey, I think it was the shot.‚Äù Because I‚Äôm pretty damn sure it is. There‚Äôs no other explanation. Again, morally I feel icky for getting it and I‚Äôm now part of the experiment, but I‚Äôm not getting the third. This is so fucked up!!!!</p>
<p>Sorry for the long ass rant. I have a lot on my chest. üôÉ</p></p>

        <p>Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
<p>I‚Äôm this close ü§è to saying on Facebook or something that my not feeling good is probably connected to the shot but I‚Äôm not in the mood for any backlash. Hell, I will eventually. I‚Äôm sick of this. It comes and goes and is random af. On Thursday I was super nauseous and had to go home early. The next day there was no nausea but I felt like throwing up. Yesterday I felt a little meh. I literally can‚Äôt do anything, I feel like lol.</p>

        <p>Yep, I feel your anger. I got it because the masks give me migraines, and I pretty much needed it for daily life. I really didn‚Äôt want to get it, but it was deciding between two terrible options. But now it‚Äôs back to masks for everyone, and it‚Äôs infuriating. Not even the one and done was worth it in my opinion. It messed up my whole week afterwards, and now we have this extra shot/booster nonsense. 
I hope you feel better! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

        <p>Haha yep! I know a part of it is because I‚Äôve been feeling sick forever but I cannot go back to wearing a mask. No way!! And yeah with the shot, it‚Äôs definitely not worth it. If I could take it back I would, but like I said my trip next year is non refundable at this point so I felt like I had to. But apparently nobody‚Äôs safe. We‚Äôre all trapped. <em>Insert scary fearmongering stuff here.</em> Lol</p>
<p>And thank you, I hope so too! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

        <p>Just breath family - most of us feel what you are going through. It‚Äôs nauseating to read popular covid opinions on Reddit. I am constantly upset by social media and news outlets, and would prefer not to use them my only problem is I‚Äôm addicted to using them as a barometer for how crazy society is. Just went on vacation though and you would think the last year never happened it was nice.</p>
