    <strong>Just curious - where are you guys on the political spectrum?</strong>
    <p><p>Always seems odd that everyone assumes we're all conservatives/Trump supporters (most redditors think that's the same thing) I was wondering where you guys sit on the political spectrum?</p>
<p>I am not here to start ANY sort of fight, please keep discussion civil (Rule 2), I just wanted to see who our allies are, and get to know you all better.</p>
<p>I guess I still consider myself a leftist on most issues, but overall I'm closer to the center. </p>
<p>Conservatives have been a MASSIVE help during our struggle, even wrote a thank-you letter to right-wingers over on r/conservative which is in my post history if anyone wants to check if out. Any conservatives that didn't see that - thank you so much. I know we disagree on quite a bit, but if it weren't for you guys we would never question anything. It drives me nuts to see how much conservatives are bullied on reddit and real life. I'm very upset with the democratic party for their immature responses to dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>Thank you to the leftists on here as well - you guys went against the narrative, thought for yourself and came to your own conclusions. That is a very honorable thing to do, especially with extremist liberals hurling out insults at us left and right because they have no logic to argue with. Especially with CNN and other biased news networks trying to shove fear down our throats.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'll get back on topic. Where do you guys stand politically? Just interested to see who I'm working with. Wherever our political views may lie, we seem to be working together very well on this sub and that makes me happy :)</p>
<p>EDIT: Guys, please don't downvote others for staring their political beliefs. The entire point of this post was to learn about the members of this sub, and where they stand on the political spectrum. I've seen a good mix between left and right so far, and I'm glad to see that we are able to keep this as civil as possible. We have been doing a great job working with eachother thus far - please don't let that stop!</p></p>

        <p>At this point I don’t identify with any party and have my own value system of right and wrong. Most of my views are liberal. I’m definitely not a conservative or trump supporter. I think most politicians are in on this and the differences between them are smaller than we’d like to think.</p>

<p>Would very much point you towards this video if you’d be interested. </p>
<p>Basically the election system, in most places, isn’t about an election but a selection of a pre-approved parties. Voting only further validates their power and not doing anything is actually better than voting. Voting, in the USA, will only lead to more powers being given to the 2 parties since they pretty much carry through the terms, regardless of party orientation. An example is George Bush implementing the Patriot Act, Obama only extended it and didn’t repeal it. So much for difference of opinions. It’s all a huge scam.</p>

        <p>The best thing you can do is VOTE. you don’t even need to vote for 2 main parties you can vote independent or vote for candidates who are for things like ranked choice voting. Vote in your local elections because they’re even more important.</p>
<p>NOT VOTING is what allows the parties to gain power, an apathetic population that doesn’t vote is the one that politicians will take advantage of</p>

        <p>Voting actually gives TPTB consent to do whatever they like which is why that always happens after elections. You should checkout the Princeton study that confirms this.  While it is generally viewed being active in the political arena is a good thing those of us who are actually paying attention see it more like "spinning  your wheels" so to speak. If we as a whole were to boycott the entire system it would seriously put those in power in a bind since they cannot move forward without any of our participation. All they have is a lot of money but that means nothing if we don't take it. How shitty would it look if no one voted and they somehow declared a winner? As someone who has been characterized as a libertarian I still say do what you want and see if what you did was effective. If it is not than you most definitely need to change what you're doing since it clearly isn't working..</p>

        <p>Libertarian in the sense that I don’t believe government has any business being involved in most of what they have their hands in. I’m pro marijuana, pro choice, pro-2nd amendment and pro minding your own fucking business. I’m a lesbian and I really don’t care who else is or isn’t gay, straight, trans, whatever. Be whatever you want but don’t expect others to kneel before you or pay for your expectations. Both political sides in the US regularly piss me off and so I tend to shy away from political conversations because people are just way too right or left about things and I just am not. Identity politics of the left have ruined the world but so have radical religious pushes from the right. I hate that there are humans who hold immense power and decision making ability who are as flawed as I am yet feel they get to dictate the freedom I am or am not allowed to have in this short life. </p>
<p>So yeah if anyone can tell me my political affiliation, knock yourselves out LOL</p>

        <p>I'd say you're similar to me - a left-leaning centrist. I don't really like the democratic party because they think everyone needs to believe the exact same things they do, every last belief.</p>
<p>I'm with you on most of those things (I think) I don't think I could call myself pro-choice until we can all agree on what a sentient life should be defined as, but at the same time prohibiting abortions does not work, and creates a very sketchy black market for them. I can see where both sides are coming from - if I was a woman and was sexually assaulted I couldn't even imagine if I didn't have access to an abortion, but at the same time many conservatives firmly believe that babies are being murdered en masse so I can see where they're coming from too.</p>
<p>Just curious, where do you stand on full drug legalization, regulation and tax money going to the government to fund schools, better treatment facilities/healthcare and (hopefully) tax cuts?</p>

        <p>Full drug legalization: on the fence. I guess it worked pretty well in Portugal and they were able to incentivize just not doing drugs but life is shit for a lot of people in the US and drugs are an easy go-to for escapism so I’m not sure I’d trust the same kind of policy here. Opioids nearly destroyed my family. Can’t wait I’d want those more easily accessible than they already are. I see a lot of homeless people in cities like LA and Seattle who don’t want to get off drugs regardless of incentive or job opportunity or housing opportunities. Not sure I’d want to give them more of a pass to just take up space on the streets. </p>
<p>I’m fine with my taxes funding schools but I do believe that public schools in the US are far too often filled with indoctrination efforts and it’s why so many kids think communism is the answer to everyone’s problems and think the US is the worst place in the world. I wish there was a way to curtail all that while still giving kids a chance with publicly funded education. </p>
<p>When it comes to healthcare, I know that our shit system is why they’re coding every last dead body for the past 5 months as Covid because they’re desperate for government kickback. If healthcare was just solidly funded, there wouldn’t be as much of a possibility for them to fuck around and get states to do shit like death certificate matching for more Covid money. I think every state-funded healthcare system has its flaws but I have a lot of friends in other countries who say the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to socialized healthcare so I would be willing to give it a shot. I’m a little jaded by all the greed that’s around our privatized healthcare system so it’s hard to not think they’d find ways to fuck the average citizen over even with socialized healthcare.</p>
<p>Personally I think we need to get back to taxing everything like we did in the 80s and 90s. A larger portion of people lived better, the wealthy were still wealthy but prosperity seemed like it was more prolific. We wouldn’t have to tax like they do in many European nations to give more Americans a shot at a prosperous middle class life.</p>

<p>unfortunately for you, if you support freedom of choice and liberty it needs to be all or nothing. if you don't support an individuals choice to abuse drugs and waste their life you aren't a libertarian or individualist. otherwise there need be some form of authoritarian control framework to prevent this which is counter to libertarian ethics</p>

        <p>This is kind of a ridiculous position to take. Most things aren’t all or nothing situations, and artificially reducing them to all or nothing situations makes it impossible to have any sort of discussion. This has always been libertarianism’s Achilles heel, and a large reason for the continual failure of the Libertarian Party in American politics.</p>

<p>but by necessity ethics and morality must be though, which are what the fundamentals of libertarian and ancap philosophy are based on. you can't have a different set of right and wrong or good and bad subject to the whims of whomever- they must apply always and equally to everyone at all times or we're just into preference and opinions. guy in a coma? check. infant child? check. adult astronaut in space? check. junkie on the corner railing meth? check. this is why the principles of property rights, self-ownership and non-aggression can be universalized</p>

        <p>This is why I'm a decentralist. If small communities with different wants and needs are able to make their own rules, however strict or lax, those rules could be enforced more fairly and justly than in a large nation with a centralized government. Humans are pack animals and some degree of hierarchy is in our blood, but a healthy hierarchy depends on people actually knowing each other and giving a fuck about each other.</p>

        <p>Decentralism is one of the best ideas nobody is presently taking notice of or pushing for. So much of what we fight over in the US could be solved if we just let local/regional communities make their own decisions. Whether that means state governments or individual counties or something else entirely I do not know, but it would certainly be better than what we’re doing now. I guess we’d still have to fight over immigration though, the only way to avoid that would be to make actual borders between states/counties.</p>

        <p>Ha, just the thought of border walls between states and counties would cause a public outcry. But I imagine more people would privately support the idea than what polls might show. Personally, I already live in an area with a border between states: a big fucking river. No one says we should drain the river. Bridges are the only way in and out, not so different from the gates of a wall.</p>

        <p>I think you’re right about more people supporting the idea than would admit to supporting it. We’ve got a very strong shy Tory effect going on right now. I’m personally predicting a much closer election than most polls indicate, and that’s the reason.</p>

        <p>That’s what I was guessing; recent converts are generally the most outspoken on matters of principle. Libertarianism is an attractive ideology, and many people, including myself, have gone through a phase where we were convinced it’s the answer to our political problems. Most of us eventually realize that it isn’t the solution, and we cringe when we look back at our former zealotry. </p>
<p>Why isn’t libertarianism the solution to our problems? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It starts from an inaccurate worldview, in which everyone is smart, capable, and driven. If everyone was like the average libertarian the system would probably work pretty well. But most people aren’t like the average libertarian, and a libertarian system has no good way to deal with people who can’t or won’t support themselves. Sure you could just ignore them and let them wallow in poverty, or just let them die, but those solutions aren’t acceptable to a vast majority of people, libertarian or otherwise. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no path to creating a libertarian state without violating libertarian principles. Forming a new nation state or reforming an existing one pretty much always requires violence, and not the self defense kind of violence. This problem also extends to maintaining a libertarian state, even if one were to be magically formed. If you must follow the NAP you have no way to deal with people who are unhappy with the system and want to change it. A bunch of collectivists could start hoarding weapons and plotting revolution to overthrow the libertarian state, and you’d be powerless to stop them until the shooting started. You’d also be powerless to prevent monopolies and pretty much every other variety of economic fuckery there is. In a nutshell, you need force to create and maintain a government, but libertarian principles prevent you from using force outside of self defense.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the main problems with libertarianism as an ideology. If we’re talking present day US politics, rather than general theory, there are more problems. The biggest of these problems is being so devoted to principles that they would rather lose again and again than violate those principles. In general Republicans, while not libertarians, are friendlier to libertarian positions and goals than Democrats are. Yet libertarian candidates, who know they have no chance to win, often deliver victory to Democratic candidates by siphoning a small portion of votes that would have otherwise gone Republican, thereby hurting their own interests just to uphold principles. This ties in to one of the other problems with libertarians: They make the sidelines the moral high ground. In reality they’re not doing anything important, and nobody cares, but as long as they can maintain ideological purity and feel superior to others they’ll be happy. But they won’t have any impact.</p>
<p>Sorry this got kind of long and ranty, I don’t mean to berate you or change your mind. Just remember that new things always seem shiny and perfect, but with time flaws become easily visible. I’d be shocked if you’re still a libertarian one year from today, and I’m curious where your ideological journey will take you. Just be careful when evangelizing, you’ll save your future self from cringing.</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree with you on almost all of this! As somebody tapering off an opioid habit (or opium habit, to be specific) us addicts agree that the opioid epidemic needs to be approached from a different angle. I TOTALLY understand where you're coming from (mom is drinking herself to death) Here are some of the benefits to my ideal approach to legalization:</p>
<p>-Pharmaceutically pure drugs (no more fentanyl or other cutting agents) just to add to this point, some dealers put fentanyl in their dope because they want their customers to die - if someone dies from their dope and others hear about it, everybody's gonna be hitting him up for his "Fire H"
-Access to clean needles
-No more nBOME on acid blotter, no more PMA/PMMA in MDMA etc.
-Taxes from drugs can be used to improve infrastructure
-Many young people use drugs because they are a "forbidden fruit" it tastes the sweetest, and they think it makes them look cool because it's rebellious - it isn't quite as rebellious if it's illegal, and it would be likely be less available to most underage kids
-No more funding a failing war on drugs
-Drugs will be slowly destigmatized. Many people look down on homeless addicts for this, and it's a reason many won't hire the homeless - they view them as worthless junkies, and not people who need help. In addition addicts are more likely to sell help.
-Drugs dealers will have to get real jobs that contribute to society and pay taxes
-<em>Possibly</em> (slightly) less government corruption
-An (unknown) impact on gangs with drugs as their primary source of incomes (pro or con?)
-Illegal things are glamorized, especially in the hip-hop industry - I don't think they'll brag about laws they aren't breaking (unless they're Will Smith)</p>
<p>I dunno, that's why I always supported FULL legalization, but I think it should be done over a year or so because if they're all made legal suddenly, addicts are gonna go nuts and overdose left and right now that they are getting pure products. What do you think about the points I've made?</p>
<p>Also, as a bonus, I'm curious, what's your stance on decriminalization/legalization of psychedelics? That's why I decided to start weening off opium in the first place.</p>
<p>P.S. I am so sorry about your family. Similar thing with alcoholism here. Opiate addicts are treated like criminals and junkies instead of people in need of support, and it just makes them feel bad, and they use their only coping mechanism - drugs :(</p>

        <p>&rt; Full drug legalization: on the fence. I guess it worked pretty well in Portugal and they were able to incentivize just not doing drugs but life is shit for a lot of people in the US and drugs are an easy go-to for escapism so I’m not sure I’d trust the same kind of policy here. Opioids nearly destroyed my family. Can’t wait I’d want those more easily accessible than they already are. I see a lot of homeless people in cities like LA and Seattle who don’t want to get off drugs regardless of incentive or job opportunity or housing opportunities. Not sure I’d want to give them more of a pass to just take up space on the streets. </p>
<p>This is why I kinda silo off marijuana from the "drugs" discussion. Opioids and methamphetamine are a horrifyingly destructive, aggressive business and every single dealer knowingly participates in hooking and destroying people's lives, in the process inflicting a scale of damage that makes a mass shooter look minor in comparison. </p>
<p>In the strongest possible terms, fuck those people. They belong in prison.</p>

        <p>I tend to think of myself this way as well. I was raised growing up as a conservative, and I have a tendency to lean more to the right, but I’m pro choice and pro-being left alone by the government. I really don’t care what people do as long as they don’t force their beliefs on me. </p>
<p>I didn’t care for either choice in 2016, and don’t really again this year. I’d love to see Kristi Noem from South Dakota run in 2024. Prior to all this lockdown/virus bullshit, I wasn’t getting involved in any political conversation because I didn’t care. 6 months in, it’s a bit of a different story.</p>

        <p>Nowhere apparently.  I'm on the side where we can look at the evidence and make a reasonable stab at decent policy decisions, and no party stands for that.  Many would have called me left wing before, but I've always supported a mix of policies some of which would of been considered left wing and some right wing before.</p>

        <p>I think you might be a centrist. I don't know why people say that like it's a dirty word, but balance is a good thing. If you go far on either side of the spectrum you get extremism, totalitarianism, anarchy etc.</p>
<p>I can totally relate. Liberals don't accept me as a liberal and conservatives don't accept me as a conservative (although, to my initial surprise, they are actually very accepting, kind and thoughtful people!). Some conservatives actually do think I'm a conservative because of my views on lockdowns/masks but I don't think that should really be a partisan issue.</p>

        <p>I would of called myself left wing before this started because I support more policies from the left than right, free at the point of service healthcare, strong social safety net etc.  but I just can't anymore because of the way left wing people have reacted in general to this event, which absolutely disgusts me.  I didn't realise they were all a bunch of jumped up authoritarians who would be more at home in the USSR than a liberal western democracy until they showed their true colours during this whole ordeal.  </p>
<p>At the same time, I strongly disagree with many policies from the right which also disgust me, for example many on the right incessantly worry about immigration and love to scapegoat immigrants as the reason for every problem in whatever country (I'm from the UK).  In the UK the right wing is also strongly associated with Brexit, which I believe, before this anyway, is the biggest mistake the UK have made since Neville Chamberlain chose not to go to war with Germany.  That isn't because I have some misplaced love for the EU, but because I'm not so deluded that I can't realise we live in a global world, and that being part of a massive trading bloc where you hold considerable clout as to what rules they instigate is obviously far, far better than the alternative of being left out on your own for the corporate vultures, other trading blocs, the USA and China to tear you apart.  Our right wing think we can go back to being 'Great' Britain and somehow control most of the planet again and that everyone will just bend to our will because of our colonial past, they haven't realised that we aren't that special or 'great' anymore.  For many, Brexit is just a thin veil over their prejudices towards immigration, and many actually think that their vote for Brexit was a vote to kick out all the 'eastern European scum' from the country.  The day after the referendum one of my friends was walking down a road in London and some guy yelled at her out of a van as he was driving past that she can 'go back home where you belong now bitch!'.  She was born here but her parents are Indian - the really funny thing, India isn't even part of the EU, so the vote has no bearing at all on whether Indian's are allowed in the country or not, so not only is it obviously racist, it's breathtakingly ignorant as well.  That's what the right wing looks like in the UK.</p>
<p>So either way I can't really associate with either side.</p>

        <p>I think I'm just now realising that the majority of people don't actually have any opinions at all.  They just pick a group, and then parrot back everything that group is told to believe.  I think the vast majority of people have never considered why they believe the things they do.  It just so happened, that before this event the left wing groupthink overlapped quite a lot with opinions I also held, but I believed them due to researching the issue and reaching my own conclusion, not being force fed a narrative by whatever media source, so I could immediately see the obvious hypocrisy over supporting the reaction to this so called virus threat and the things that the left wing claimed to care about before.</p>

        <p>It surprises me when I see people who were Bernie supporters openly conversing with and supporting known conservatives. As much as the powers that be try, there are issues that will never be fully political and lockdowns are one of them.</p>

        <p>Oh that’s not what I meant...I tend to expect more hesitation from the left, if anything. Most conservatives I know are totally willing to discuss opposing views and it’s crazy radicals that even other conservatives don’t like who are often the face of conservatism. So that wasn’t what I meant. It’s hard to see non-tense political conversations these days so I just didn’t expect it from any side before this sub.</p>

        <p>OK, I'm sorry I misunderstood you. I guess I'm too used to being demonised lol. </p>
<p>I'm a conservative, nothing radical, I don't really care about the social side, financial is more important to me. I'm happy to discuss with people I disagree with, as long as we can have a calm discussion. I have a few left leaning friends I can spar with and it's good to have people try to pick holes in your opinions. </p>
<p>Honestly I think a lot of right leaning people are totally reasonable, but we get attacked and silenced so the only right wing opinions you hear are the people that decided 'fuck it! This is what I think and I don't care!'. If people bring up politics at work conservatives have to be careful what they say, whereas left wing people can shout their views from the rooftop.</p>

        <p>Just joking for the most part but really man, I don't know what a racist or a Nazi is anymore. Put it this way, I think that it's ok to be white. GASP I know that's a controversial statement on this shit website that's been taken over by bots and Leftist NGO-paid shills. Anything that is censored, anything you tell me is off limits or taboo or closed for discussion, I will be curious about and I will follow the truth wherever it leads me. And it just so happens that most of the stuff being censored on sites like reddit and youtube lean to the right. Really makes you think about why that is. The truth fears no investigation. But people will call me a Trump supporter nonetheless, so by extension, they mean a "nazi" or a "white supremacist" of which I am neither. And I don't like Trump. Probably for different reasons than most here but I don't live in the 2-party paradigm.</p>

<p>I don't know why anyone assumes anyone that assumes ANYONE that agrees with ANY conservative viewpoints is a trump supporter. I know plenty of conservatives and only one of them supports Trump lol.</p>
<p>Oh man, I gotta try and dig up my post on r/conservatives thanking those guys. That was where I got my first (and only) death threat from a conservative. The rest have all been from liberals.</p>
<p>Some liberal piece of garbage even went on there to rip on me while I was recovering from an awful benzo addiction. Who makes fun of someone for that? Worst withdrawal from anything by far - I was at the point where I was finally able to feel some happiness again, and this guy had to come in and trash me for being a recovering addict.</p>
<p>Remember the Salem Witch Trials? They never ended - this is just another witch hunt, this time against conservatives and normal people who want life to return to normal. Sad world we're living in :(</p>

<p>I'm glad you got the help you needed and beat that shit man. I did the same with booze a while back. And now that we've completely gone mental as a society, I can't even go to AA meetings to see people in person- they're all on Zoom now. </p>

        <p>Exactly, according the morons that run this site now, "anything we disagree with is white supremacist".  They think everyone must go along with their racism and revisionist history, or somehow you're carrying some sort of "white supremacist" scarlet letter.   Like their weak baseless accusations hold ANY weight whatsoever.  </p>
<p>There really aren't very many "white supremacists" in existence in the fashion those morons think they are.  Yet they're secretly convinced, hopeful even, that literally half the country are one.  You can't get any dumber than that.</p>

        <p>I was a Clinton voter in 2016, I'm honestly flabbergasted to be looking at myself in 2020 and understanding that I've now become a Trump voter if not Trump "supporter". </p>
<p>Trying to cling to a sane world with silly things like freedom and liberty by voting Trump feels like trying to swim with a cinderblock tied to one leg, but voting for Democrats feels like trying to swim when your ankle is cuffed to the rail on the Titanic.</p>

        <p>Interesting! May I ask why that changed? Was going to vote for trump in 2016 (even as a liberal at the time) but I was 17 at the time so I couldn't.</p>
<p>Am now glad I didn't, but I am still curious to hear your viewpoint? Again I am not here to attack anybody, just to get to know you guys - as a former supporter I know you're often accosted by others, screamed at, getting your face spit in etc. and that's absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Anyways I'm ranting again haha. So what strengthened your opinion over the last 4 years?</p>

        <p>In 2016 I voted for Ted Cruz in my primary, I thought he best represented my views. When he dropped out and it became clear Trump would win nomination I was very depressed. I was a “never” trumped, I never liked trump. I never watched his reality shows, didn’t like that he always seemed to be about self promotion and vanity, and even though I wasn’t an Obama voter I thought the whole birth certificate thing was stupid. So when Trump won the nomination, I was way more fearful of a Hillary win, so I voted against her, and was set to be disappointed, but when he won I was very relieved.</p>
<p>What’s moved me more to enthusiastic is I’ve watched him for 3 years. Yes, some of his tweets are cringe and rude, but he does not back down from the far left. The media, Hollywood, and democrats have thrown every lie and tactic possible at him. There isn’t even a hint of pretending to be fair or neutral, everything is constantly negative. Trump Derangement is real, and it sickens me. I didn’t agree with a lot of what Obama did, but I respected the office and if he did or said something I liked, I gave him credit.</p>
<p>I was so used to “conservative” politicians backing down and being the nice guys while the left tore them apart and shut them down. Trump is a fighter, he does not back down and doesn’t play nice. I think that’s what’s needed going forward if there is to be any chance to stop the hard push left, so I’m looking to support leaders with backbones!</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

        <p>Well I was a democrat before this year happened lol. I was a Bernie Sanders supporter and cried when he lost the nomination. I believe strongly that healthcare should be available to everyone regardless of how much money you have. Then the lockdowns happened and I found myself questioning everything. I guess now I’m more of a libertarian, I really don’t know- I agree with what Ron Paul has to say on all the government overreach. I feel like the mainstream media had kind of conditioned me to hate trump supporters and now I’ve kind of woken up to how divisive society is. So I was kind of forced to realize how some of my values are more conservative and at the same time I was shocked at how authoritarian the left was. I thought we were the good guys, you know?! So it has been an awakening. And I kind of credit my interest in conspiracies for helping me to finally face the fact that both sides of our two party political system is corrupt. I don’t like either trump or Biden and I don’t believe politics is going to save us. It’s a mirage that makes people feel empowered and like they have a choice. It’s a distraction so that people don’t realize their own power and self sufficiency IMHO.</p>

        <p>Conservative, but leaning more towards the moderate side as there are a few key social issues I tend to agree with the left on a bit more (abortion and gay marriage being the two big ones I can think of). However I don’t like trump, or at least him as a person. Big fan of what he had done economically up until all this but I just cannot get on board with him as a person whatsoever. However I refuse to vote left, so I suppose it’s either not voting or him, and I do feel the need to vote so him it is. Especially after the last few months, I don’t think I’ll ever vote left in my life</p>

        <p>If not for this fiasco I'd probably be voting democratic. As it stands, I now see Trump as the last remaining barrier between us and the woke far left that has gone insane. If it was up to those lunatics, we'd all be locked up with the economy in deep depression, eating Spam and waiting for the <strong>vaccine</strong>. We're already seeing this trend progressing apace in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

        <p>Was a lifelong progressive democrat before the lockdowns made me fearful of a rabidly authoritarian left. Now my head is spinning and I’m questioning how much of our lives should be controlled by the government at all. Everything given can be taken away if we are “naughty,” so things like universal healthcare and UBI, which I strongly supported 6 months ago, now seem like they could be merely means of more social control (refuse vaccine? No healthcare for you. Caught not wearing a mask? We’ll take away your UBI) I’m feeling politically orphaned and it’s disorienting and disappointing. Toying with not voting in November; can’t imagine casting my ballot for either candidate. I’ve never not voted in a presidential election.</p>

        <p>Afaik for "defund the police" what they are actually saying is to keep the police for response to violent incidents, and have therapists for those threatening suicide, drug abuse counselors/former addicts for nonviolent drug "crimes" and maybe couple's counselor-types for domestic disputes, although it would make sense to have an officer with a gun there imo.</p>
<p>I do NOT support the police at all - they have screwed me over every chance they get (even when I didn't do anything wrong) and right now, well, they're just going nuts. In Minnesota many are scared to even call the police if necessary because of fear of either being laughed off the phone, getting their houses searched or getting hurt. I had a cop grab me and throw me to the side, and I fell and hit my head on a wall, because I was "walking too far ahead of him".</p>
<p>The optimistic part of me thinks there has to be SOME good police out there (or at least police that truly do think they're doing the right thing) but if you don't like the laws you have to enforce, there are plenty of other careers to choose from. I've heard "it's just my job" a few times. If you really don't want to enforce draconian laws and lock people up for a dime bag you shouldn't be a cop.</p>
<p>Of course police have done wonderful things and saved many lives before - but it seems to me that they've been doing a lot more harm than good recently.</p>

        <p>I’m a Democratic socialist . While I’m not a fan of his policies and nor will I vote for  him but I hope Trump is re-elected . 
One, it will serve as a middle finger to the political maneuvering of democratic governors who are holding us hostage with lockdowns . 
Second , a Biden victory would be disastrous for those like me who are to the left of the Democratic Party . I am convinced it would extinguish even the faintest flicker of hope I have for  a truly progressive president in my lifetime. 
All that being said , I have been against lockdowns since pretty much the beginning .</p>

        <p>This is where I am. I cannot bring myself to vote for Trump and still think he’s awful but at this point I think Democrats deserve it if he gets re-elected because people think he’s the only way to freedom. If Biden goes with Gretchen Whitmer (I don’t think he will but I’ve seen multiple articles saying they met recently) Trump will win. I think he’s got a huge chance anyway but that will seal it for anyone terrified of being locked down with no end in sight.</p>

        <p>Trumps betting odds are looking worse than ever, and the woke left is <em>extremely</em> energised after 4 years of trump, they hate him with a seething passion and will certainly show up at the polls which they didn’t for Clinton.</p>
<p>Trump would destroy addled Biden in a debate, but they aren’t going to allow that to happen. It will be under the guise of “social distancing” or something similar. All Biden has to do is coast to the White House, keep this COVID “crisis” as much as an issue for Trump as possible, keep the media on him hard to swing the regular lefties and moderates.</p>

        <p>I am an old school British Labour voter. I believe in all the things that the left used to believe in before it got embedded in divisive and disgusting identity politics. To me free speech is the bedrock of society and the cancel culture and endless manipulation to set people who should be allied against each other is beyond the pale.</p>
<p>So, I find myself politically homeless. I am still "left" on some issues, "right" on others, and even, god forbid "libertarian" on others. But I would say, I've become a single issue participant in politics to some extent - questioning narratives and promoting free speech have become the focus of everything to me. People do not realize what they are throwing away.</p>

        <p>I’m very left.  I support direct democracy/worker ownership models as in worker co-ops and such.  What makes me incredibly uncomfortable are the emergency orders that give all the power to the executive, without any input from the population at large or other branches.  Emergency declarations are meant for short term disasters like floods, earthquakes, hurricanes etc.  COVID will be with us for a while and it’s unclear to me when these executives plan on ending those orders.  When there is a vaccine?  Only if there are no new cases?  The citizens should know what those thresholds are and what’s the plan to get us back to normal governance on a state and local level.  As it is now it’s the worst of nanny state liberalism.</p>

        <p>Well, I voted for the democratic governor currently on a power trip in my state, so that's my fault. I generally lean left especially on social issues but I like to take things on a case by case basis. Basically, if I haven't read up on an issue I don't have an opinion until I do--I don't just go along with the party narrative. I've voted both Republican and Democrat as the issues demand. I've voted against extremely popular Democrats in the past on the state and federal level. Looking back, I was never liberal enough to run with the cool kids. I always had something to say counter to the narrative, even if I generally agreed. This has not made me a popular guest at parties lately, if indeed any parties were happening.</p>

        <p>I used to consider myself left of centre but with the rise of the woke left, I’m reluctant to call myself that anymore. I think they’re very dangerous. Plus annoying. So now I consider myself neither left nor right. I lean libertarian though.

        <p>When I first started getting into politics (13/14 years old) I considered myself center-left. Then, as I continued to learn more and grow as a person, I shifted more towards the conservative side, and when people asked, I'd say I was a conservative, though I was pretty much in the center. Now, at 18, I'd say I'm more libertarian than anything else (I've shifted quite dramatically over the last year), but I don't really identify with any party. I look at each issue on an independent level and form an opinion. Although I have nothing against people who lean left, the <em>radical</em> left is becoming increasingly more dangerous every year.</p>

        <p>Liberal. However after this mess I really don’t know. I will not be voting for Trump but if Biden chooses Gretchen Whitmer as his running mate I won’t know what the hell to do. Based on what she’s done in Michigan, we will be locked down until 2030 if she gets any kind of national platform.</p>

<p>I have some disagreements with GOP, to be sure. But if I can’t even take my kid to the playground, choose what I want to wear or NOT wear (fuck these masks), send my kid to school, run our family business without being shutdown by the govt every time a disease comes around etc.....the rest just doesn’t matter to me anymore.</p>

<p>I do not personally identify as anything where politics is concerned. I don't like politics, and I think the entire left/right paradigm is a false dichotomy which serves no purpose but to sew conflict and division.</p>
<p>Very interesting thread, as I have also observed people saying we are all "conservatives", whatever that is supposed to mean. Yes, I've heard all the different labels before. They don't really mean anything though.</p>

        <p>I used to be classic Democrat. I have pet issues where I see the value of personal freedom. We need a healthcare solution that takes care of all citizens but isn’t a centralized bureaucracy that has poor service and health policies by committee. Government has to take care of big things like transportation infrastructure. A lot of federal services like the post office are reliable. The Left has become authoritarian and censors/cancels voices it doesn’t like. I’m super tired of identity politics. I’m not really sure the lockdown problem is partisan. The states that locked down the hardest have the biggest cities and happen to be a Democrat. Though, the ones challenging the lockdown are Republicans.</p>

        <p>Going off the Sapply compass test I took recently, I’m <em>almost</em> basically a centrist. I’m neither particularly progressive nor conservative, relatively libertarian (small L), and somewhat to the right, but I truly think that my overall beliefs (as well as everyone else’s) can never be neatly sorted out onto a scale or spectrum.</p>
<p>That said, I’m strongly skeptical of anything the federal government anyways, and this constant peddling of the “new normal” bullshit is no different.</p>

        <p>The left calls me far right, the right calls me far left. Really depends on the issue at hand. Libertarian in the streets, authoritarian in the bedroom, more of a decentralist or secessionist than anything. Anti-expansionist, anti-imperialist, anti-interventionist, anti-globalist. 8values quiz says I'm a green libertarian or libertarian capitalist, RightValues says I'm a classical liberal  and LeftValues says I'm a utopian socialist. Basically I don't really have a problem with authoritarianism so long as certain policies remain reasonably isolated to families and small communities.</p>

        <p>Left leaning/libertarian-ish I have always been this way, but the situation has reinforced my views even more in the libertarian direction. I have lost all faith in the democratic party. They really have shown to be wolves in sheep's clothing in my opinion. Still however, not a fan of the republican party either, can't jive with some of their views, but that's okay.</p>

        <p>Somewhere in between conservative and neolib. Note that I live in the UK and these things have a slightly different meaning here. I strongly support economic freedoms. At the same time, I think that uncontrolled social changes are dangerous and we need to evaluate their long-term impact (that's why I'm not a full neolib, for instance, I think that we need to be careful with mass immigration and have control over who comes in, making sure that they integrate well).</p>

        <p>I am apolitical. Ironically I've been called a mindless liberal by those on the right, and a degenerate Trump supporter by those on the left. I just want the truth and practical solutions to shared problems by those on both ends of the political spectrum. From my observations most problems highlighted by the left and right seem to be socially engineered to keep the public infighting. Allow me to elaborate. </p>
<p>On the left, we see their cornerstone issues are abortion: a woman's right to choose, economic safety nets: welfare social, security, and health care etc. </p>
<p>On the right we have terrorism: the inherent need to have a bloated military, welfare (ironically) and the need to cut most of the programs since it promotes lazy behavior and removes incentives to work and immigration, the idea that an influx of immigrants degrades our economic way of life and degrades our social structure by erasure of "native culture" and current social norms (the term "native" being debatable I know but bear with me) . </p>
<p>Most of these problems can be solved by overhauling the banking aspect of the world's economies and limiting corporations from participating and covertly funding military adventurism. Currently most workers here in the US are taxed before we even get our checks through the federal income tax. This is literal theft since something is being taken BEFORE you possess it despite it being 100% yours and no one else. That would eliminate at least 1/5 of the people seeking assistance since they are now able to keep ALL of what they earn.</p>
<p>Limiting corporations from stealing other countries resources would cut down on immigration and would remove incentives for those trying to grab power in 3rd world countries to appease those in power here in the US in exchange for wealth and prestige. Ending the drug war also keeps these countries in abject poverty so that needs to be addressed as well.</p>
<p>There is a huge problem with the deliberate destruction of family values especially in minority communities that cause people to consider abortion and to stay on welfare/section 8 housing. With the promotion of rap, which was hijacked in my opinion, and made to promote self destructive behaviors is a huge contributor to the problems POOR minorities face. I do believe that not all minorities are poor due to the fact that the black community alone contributes trillions of dollars in purchases in this economy and I am one of them actually.</p>
<p>Health care is another issue that is not addressed properly. The left will constantly promote socialist ideas regarding doctor visits and medication but nowhere do we see the promotion of healthier lifestyles and eating habits which is far more cost effective and beneficial. No, on the contrary we see body positivity/fat acceptance and a culture that shames anyone daring to say otherwise. Partisan view points keep people in a state of "it's my way or nothing at all" when in reality these are very solvable problems which is one reason out of many why I reject politics all together. At some point they become extremely impractical and burdensome regardless of where you stand on the political spectrum. </p>
<p>How do you continue to be a military supporting republican when your son gets his legs blown off and the VA decides he's not injured enough to meet his claims? How about the soldiers with PTSD? I guess waking up in the middle of the night screaming bloody murder isn't enough reason to meet that soldiers claim either. When he signed up he was fighting for ALL americans and you were proud of his sacrifice and yet he is abandoned by his own government when it was time to help him in his darkest hour. </p>
<p>How do you continue to support abortion when you see your daughter spiral into depression and continues to live a dysfunctional life of alcoholism and promiscuity after having her second one? Where are all those proud strong feminist when she goes to the clinic? Will they skip going to the club to check on her? Will they come over and hold her while she cries for the 4th night in a row? I mean I could go on but the reality is at some point we're going to start to have to look at things with human eyes instead of shades of blue and red. That's my take, didn't know I was going to go this direction with your question but here it is, lol.</p>

        <p>I’ve been a die hard conservative for years. However, after Trump’s EO yesterday giving money to people who refuse to work, I don’t know where I stand anymore. I am so disappointed in him but I also can’t ever ever go to the other side after watching what has happened these last six months in left wing states. They’ve shown their true colors and what they really want to happen and it scares the shit out of me.
Edited to say: didn't realize honesty got downvotes around here.</p>

        <p>I'm a Libertarian and vote for them when there's an opportunity.  I don't believe the government has ANY right to dictate ANYTHING about your personal life.  What you own, what you consume, what you read or say.  </p>
<p>Absent a libertarian option though, I always vote Republican.  Democrats have gotten <em>shockingly</em> bad to the point where I cannot believe anybody is not able to see past their sheer evil and corruption.  I guess I would have not believed that level of mass delusion possible, if it weren't also for this whole COVID freakout making everyone rush to throw the world in the trash in a panic.</p>

        <p>Im somewhere center-left, I suppose I align closest to that of a Social Democrat. I supported Bernie Sanders in the primaries but later realized he didnt have the backbone to take on any sort of real corruption. I believe the government has a responsibility to help its struggling citizens...something it obviously isnt doing during these lockdowns and has taken the path of infringing on basic rights instead. Too many corrupt politicians and money in politics has prevented any real change in the country for years, and its no surprise the government is working with the media to scare everyone into submission so that their interests can take hold (such as corporations filling the void of small businesses that have closed, as everyone else loses their jobs, the wealthy have been getting richer). Id also like to point out that too many people dont understand that most true leftists dont support all the SJW bullshit and authoritarian overreach. That stuff is mainly supported by identity politics loving neoliberals who have nothing else to cling to since they want to keep everything the same. Leftists definitely dont love people like Nancy Pelosi lol</p>
