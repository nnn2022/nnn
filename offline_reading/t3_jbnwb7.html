    <strong>Are all nurses against the new normal?</strong>
    <p><p>Every single person at my work is a sheep. Everyone I know except a very select few people are sheep. They will have a borderline heart attack if I mention that a rushed vaccine might be unsafe and remind me that if nobody listened to "scientists" that the world would be in peril.</p>
<p>Anyways, one thing I noticed is that I have a few friends that are RN and LPN and neither of them give a flying fuck. They aren't actively anti mask or covid, but they pass clear through all hand sanitizing stations and I have never seen them wear a mask. </p>
<p>Are hospital workers wise to this bS?</p></p>

        <p>My one doctors office has a sign saying masks are optional. Then yesterday I had to go to an imaging center, and although they had every single covid protocol in place at the front of the office, I was pleasantly surprised to find the tech that I saw was one of us. We had a long talk about “no new normal”.</p>
<p>My cousin is an ICU nurse. She is pro-schools opening, pro-Halloween etc. Her one thing is that we need to be mindful of loud, sloppy bars with drunk people yelling and making poor choices, and to be mindful of hand washing. </p>
<p>I have a doctor friend who worked covid floors in NYC. He is extremely vocal about being anti-lockdown. </p>
<p>My botox nurse doesn’t care if I wear a mask when I am seeing her. Only have to in the lobby. </p>
<p>Most medical professionals I know are on our side. They believe the cure is more dangerous then the cause.</p>

        <p>Healthcare workers are taught how to properly don and dispose of PPE, and they have to be properly fitted for their gear at regular intervals. As a result, they are acutely aware that the whole masking mandate and social distancing is just security theater nonsense.</p>

        <p>I think it’s half and half in my hospital. Some know it’s complete bullshit, but there are also others who are completely pro-mask, lock down, and doom and gloom of those restrictions ever lifted.</p>

        <p>I don't work in a hospital, but am currently being treated for something recently so I am in and out of hospitals a lot in recent weeks. Lots of security theater around here, and the medical staff seem to treat me and other patients like lepers they are afraid to touch...which sucks for me because the ailment I have requires them to examine me thoroughly, which I feel they are not.</p>

        <p>They're out there, they just can't speak up because they may lose their job if their doomer mob colleagues gang up on them and get them "canceled."</p>
<p>As people were clapping "for the heroes" every evening, hundreds (if not thousands) of providers in the US were being laid off.</p>

        <p>I don’t think many healthcare workers are willing to risk getting fired to speaking out. It’s becoming the new McCarthy era. I don’t blame them. With cancel culture they could get canned for even hinting at Jon-compliance.</p>

        <p>I'm not a nurse. In my country the pro lockdown and pro mask nurses and medical professionals have been very active on social media and in news, so most likely there may be a silent minority too that we rarely hears about. The skeptics just don't share their opinions in the public.</p>

        <p>Nurse here :).  In healthcare world, it is basically the job of the nurse to be the “voice of pragmatism” in the sense of being a bit of a shield between the patient and the doctor(s).  It’s not in our scope of practice to prescribe any meds, treatments, interventions, etc., BUT we are a “safety net” to ensure that the patient is being advocated for and heard.  We are also responsible—even though we don’t prescribe them—for knowing every treatment and medication our patient is receiving, so that we are able to intervene and stop the patient from being harmed in the event of a physician or pharmacy error (i.e. ensuring that the dose of medication we are instructed to give that patient actually makes sense and isn’t a typo or clinical error—think difference between 4 and 40 mg of a narcotic is the difference between pain relief and respiratory failure).</p>
<p>Anyway, because of all that, I do think we tend to be realists—every day we’re supposed to look at the treatments our patients are receiving and assess whether it’s actually WORKING, or if it’s just neutral or even causing harm.  So I (and a LOT of my nursing friends) get rather leery when we see something touted as a “solution” that is wildly unsustainable (lockdowns).  I know some nurses who are Doomers, but overall I’d say we’re not generally prone to hysterical emotional reactions or fear-based actions. :)</p>
