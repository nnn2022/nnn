        <p>We've already had a discussion on this very topic. There's an easy answer that the doomers will give you, and it is that "all of the above" have some partial effect, therefore they are needed. That answer misses the point that in fact <em>no</em> measures are needed <em>at all</em> when the mortality and hospital loads are dropping continuously.</p>
<p>I personally don't appreciate the conspiracy theory elements of adding the "evil Gates" picture with zero supporting information about what he has to gain from vaccines and such.</p>

<p>Thats irrelevant to the discussion. The issue is ..is Gates financially invested in these corporate entities and what does that entail ...if not for the vaccine then perhaps the tracking and record keeping</p>

        <p>So I definitely think Covid-19 was planned, it’s being exaggerated to cause fear and consequently a distracted population that will easily submit. The new world order is not a conspiracy anymore, I live in the UK and the term has been slipped in a few times on the news - BBC, ITV, etc. </p>
<p>If there actually was a deadly virus, social distancing, PPE, hand sanitiser (and the likes) would actually be useful, but there would also be a wave of hundreds of thousands even millions being evidently effected and not dramatised by our corrupt media.</p>

        <p>If seatbelts work, why airbags? If airbags work, why seatbelts? If they both work, why traffic lights? If all of them work, why have traffic laws? No one safety measure will be 100% effective. That’s why we need to combine them. And about fauci saying masks don’t work, I think what he was trying to get across was that they weren’t effective enough to justify taking the PPE away from hospital workers, who really needed it, but now that they are being made in large quantities, why not use them if they have any effect on the spread. Try this out: blow out a candle with no mask, then try to do the same with a mask on. It will be much harder (if not impossible) to blow it out. And I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty sure air molecules are smaller than viruses. I’m not really pro-lockdown or mandates, but I want to do what I can to get back to the old normal. And if you don’t want a new normal, you should be doing the same</p>

<p>they dont work. The cdc research bears it out https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they dint work. A simple experiment bears this out https://youtu.be/IjJSYHdYQt8</p>
</li>
<li>

        <p>Come on, this post again? </p>
<p>Masks, assuming they work, aren’t a hazmat suit. They function similarly to something along the lines of covering your face with your elbow, albeit to a more effective degree. Air still goes out the top and sides if one were to sneeze, and a small portion of particulates are launched forward as well. As such, both mask wearing and social distancing are recommended to be applied together, in order to further reduce the spread than either one alone.</p>
<p>This isn’t even touching on the subjects of people touching their masks, wearing them incorrectly, or wearing ineffective masks, which social distancing covers under its umbrella of protection as well.</p>
<p>Even if you completely disagree with what I’ve said, you should still acknowledge that, with the post’s scenario of masks and social distancing being effective, masks and social distancing are more effective together than alone.</p>

        <p>When did I say that masks protected the wearer? The only statement that I said even remotely related to that concept was to clarify that they <strong>weren’t</strong> hazmat suits.</p>
<p>Not to mention, your post was the one that gave the statement “If masks work”, not me. I just went off that example to show that, even if they do, one should still apply social distancing as a concept.</p>
<p>I never argued that masks do, in fact work, just that in your example of them working, social distancing should still be applied.</p>

<p>https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high</p>

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.

        <p>No. All the actual data shows that masks do not prevent the spread. How you can still believe that masks slow the spread is unreal. Almost every place on earth that has mandated masks has not seen any measurable impact on slowing the spread of covid. Your faith in masks is not backed by science, data or common sense.</p>

<p>Also, Norway didn't mandate masks until <a href="https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/norway-makes-first-face-mask-recommendation-pandemic-began">August 14th</a>. So masks certainly played no part in its low number of cases and deaths. But let's look at <a href="https://imgur.com/pWZHw6V">Norway</a>. Norway imposed a mask mandate on public transportation on August 14th, and since then it has seen seen a steady increase in cases. So what did masks do in Norway?</p>

        <p>It's like you are ignoring that social distancing plays a big role.  Public transportation is very crowded, so just wearing masks and not caring about social distancing explains why there were still cases, but not as much as Sweden, because they did not mandate masks, even if they are vulnerable, they still would have been protected by the mask.   And don't forget that there are a lot of people who either don't wear the mask right or just have it on their chin."Basically, the 2018 and 2019 flu seasons in Sweden were much less lethal than its neighbors, leaving significantly more vulnerable people in Sweden that were ultimately killed by Covid in April." Show me the sources that say this.   And Sweden's cases have started rising.  And are you forgetting  that so many people refuse to wear a mask and protest against it in florida?  just look at the anti-mask protests, they don't social distance. And look how many people like you are there. And in Illinois the masks slowed the spread, according to the graph. There might be peaks, but because of reason I already said. The numbers are dropping in Illinois. And I actually showed you studies focusing on how the masks help stop the spread of Covid.  And they have sources, and are peer reviewed.  You have not shown me something that clearly says that masks don't work.</p>

        <p>I shared the article that explains what happened in Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia. Here is is again. https://www.aier.org/article/swedens-high-covid-death-rates-among-the-nordics-dry-tinder-and-other-important-factors/ . All of Scandinavia was able to see the spread of covid reduce without any masks. Sweden had more deaths early on for very understandable reasons laid out in the article. It is also a significantly bigger country than any of its neighbors.</p>
<p>I posted like 25 places where masks have shown no measurable impact at preventing the spread of covid. Illinois has had a mask mandate since May, yet their cases have climbed to nearly the same level as their first peak at the beginning of May. All the measures that were implemented there have not really done anything, the disease spread quickly regardless. </p>
<p>I definitely am not forgetting that people don't wear masks right or refuse to wear them. Those are two big factors that make mask mandates not work. It is an unrealistic policy that requires universal compliance and untrained people to correctly wear their masks. And this </p>

<p>There are countless examples that show that masks make no measurable impact on preventing the spread of covid. Masks are illogical and irrational, and the justification for their widespread use is very weak.</p>

<p>&rt; the number of excess cases per 100,000 residents in states reopening without masks is ten times the number in states reopening with masks after 8 weeks</p>
<p>&rt;This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19. States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.</p>

        <p>This is a perfect example of lying with stats in order to manipulate and deceive. So the study looks at when indoor dining was opened, and then counts cases for 8 weeks. I wonder why?? Most places opened up for indoor dining around the start of May. From May to July is when we saw the largest increase in testing. And June and July are when the disease had run its course in the north east and just started to spread in the south and west. Few states had mask mandates before May. The places that had early mask mandates, for the most part, are the places that got hit hard early (NY, NJ, etc). So the disease had already peaked before people started wearing masks, and before anywhere was opening up.This study is just looking back at what we know, and then figuring out a way to make masks look effective by picking arbitrary time frames and comparing places with no real context. If you are convinced by this study, you are a moron.</p>

        <p>Raw data needs no peer review. It speaks for itself. I know you need to wait for your priests to tell you what you are allowed to believe, but one day you are going to realize that you have been misled and that you chose to put your faith in lies, and honestly I feel sorry for you. But I get why you have chosen to ignore the actual data by blindly hiding behind "Peer Review". It's a convenient defense mechanism that protects you from having to think for yourself. And even though you have no idea what was actually reviewed, who reviewed it, when it was reviewed, or how it was reviewed, you will continue worshiping your Gods and showing your true devotion regardless. It's unfortunate.</p>

        <p>But that's why different doctor have them peer reviewed and tested, to get different perspectives to make sure it's safe.  That's how they found out it was dangerous.  And no I don't trust anyone with a lab coat.  I look for their sources, to see if they are peer reviewed, If the writer has any info and is credible.  And if they don't have these, then they are probably not trustworthy.</p>

<p>Wrong it was pulled off the market because the lawsuits from deaths was too much for the pharmaceutical maker to bear and an embarrassment for the FDA. </p>

        <p>That was on your article, you are getting mad at your own evidence. "Public health officials here argue that masks are not effective enough at limiting the spread of the virus to warrant mass use, insisting it is more important to respect social distancing and handwashing recommendation" Again you already know what happened, "For several weeks this spring, Sweden had the highest death rate per capita in Europe, and one that was 20 times that of neighbouring Norway."  That came from your own article.  So now you are the "Fucking Liar" Who gives articles that were proven wrong and still has not shown me any valid article with actual studies showing masks work.

<p>But unlike many countries in Europe seeing a resurgence of cases -- such as France, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Italy -- Sweden's data now seem to be pointing in the right direction: down. <em>thats called Herd Immunity</em> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its daily death toll peaked in April and is now down to a couple of deaths a day, the number of cases have been in steady decline since early June, and its R-number has pretty much stayed under 1 since early July. </p>

<li>
<p>Sweden's public health officials say they see no reason to change their strategy given the seemingly positive trend -- including their stance on masks.</p>

        <p>"Sweden's public health officials say they see no reason to change their strategy given the seemingly positive trend -- including their stance on masks."  But other health professionals say it's not a good idea, just like herd immunity isn't a good idea for covid-19,  because more people would die and not just people of old age.  They could spread it to more and more people if they don't wear masks or social distance till the vaccine.  That's why you should wear a mask. and I'm pretty sure you are the "pathetic liar" since you give claims with no evidence to support them, and I showed you why Sweden doesn't have herd immunity and why masks do work to help stop the spread of Covid-19 in my previous comments.</p>

In America policy is set more or less by Fauchis group at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. </p>
<p>I can name at least 4 doctors off the top head (in public practice) including the one recently added to the White House Covid Taskforce (Dr Scott Atlas) who dont agree with Fauchi or our national policy.  </p>
<p>Even Fauchi doesnt agree with Fauchi </p>

<p>Point is disagreements exist in a country but policy is set by their Chief medical doctor or Health minister. For us its Anthony Fauchi for them its Anders Tegnell </p>

        <p>Yeah, but most studies made by other doctor or universities show that masks do help stop the spread, and why herd immunity is a bad idea because of how many people will die.  That is why people died in Sweden more than other countries that had a lock down.  It would make more sense to wear masks and social distance.</p>

Norway had masks and shutdown, and they had 275 deaths, way less than sweden.  "For every study you post I can post one that says otherwise."

        <p>Italy had so many deaths because 37% of the population were over the age of 65, there were more elderly people.  And after the masks and lockdown the cases and deaths started declining.  And Covid spread so fast and there was many people infected with it in NYC before the masks and social distancing.  And in my previous article presented it states, "One category of evidence comes from laboratory studies of respiratory droplets and the ability of various masks to block them. An experiment using high-speed video found that hundreds of droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers were generated when saying a simple phrase, but that nearly all these droplets were blocked when the mouth was covered by a damp washcloth." And, "A recent study published in Health Affairs, for example, compared the COVID-19 growth rate before and after mask mandates in 15 states and the District of Columbia. It found that mask mandates led to a slowdown in daily COVID-19 growth rate, which became more apparent over time. The first five days after a mandate, the daily growth rate slowed by 0.9 percentage-points compared to the five days prior to the mandate; at three weeks, the daily growth rate had slowed by 2 percentage-points." And don't forget, "Two compelling case reports also suggest that masks can prevent transmission in high-risk scenarios, said Chin-Hong and Rutherford.

        <p>"Blah blah blah. Sour when your bull shit nit picking game is turned against you."  Excuse me who showed you why there were so many deaths, you can search up the death count.

A claim and an explanation are not the same.  "Sour when your bull shit nit picking game is turned against you."  Were you not the person who got mad at his own sources because they didn't fit with your opinion?  "Blah blah blah."  That is pretty ignorant and childish, you only listen to your opinions and you cant handle criticism.</p>

        <p>Again, It spread really fast and like most of the world, they were not ready for it, so it took a while before they  could get the situation somewhat in control.  Like NYC.  And Sweden still had deaths, more deaths than some countries like Norway.  Sweden does not have herd immunity.</p>

        <p>No, wrong again. </p>
<p>The masks were useless. </p>
<p>Nyc has herd immunity because its dense packed environ (for the record I grew up in the Bronx) means airbone pathogens are UNAVOIDABLE. </p>
<p>If youve ever been to the 5 boroughs of Nyc you'd realize how laughable the notion of protecting yourself from a viral agent with cloth masks are. </p>
<p>It took months before the idiots at the MTA to realize that they should be cleaning trains, that was long after the April peak. And you think masks made a difference?</p>
<p>That April peak is duplicated worldwide in all countries with and without lockdown</p>

<p>The masks were useless."  NO, how do you think the studies I gave you show why masks work.  Do you have a lab where you study mask fibers against Covid-19?  Have you come up with a conclusion and have your studies peer reviewed?  Have you published your studies?  Because you sure as hell have not done any of these.  You have only showed me death counts, which I explained.  But you haven't gave me something that has a study where masks were tested against this virus. I gave you evidence focusing on the mask and why it works, and they actually tested it, you have not. So you can't say that masks don't work.  So now, "Youve graduated from moron to imbecile".  Stop being so arrogant and ignorant, and learn how to spell before you brag about how you could, "Sleep through writing classes and get As".</p>

        <p>"Youve graduated from moron to imbecile"  That was the point, I repeated them to show you your hypocrisy.  "Look, you are not very bright and your idiotic arguments are ones that my 7 year old can rip to shreds. Accept it and move on"  Then why the hell can you not spell you've or I'm correctly?  You can't tell you are not arrogant after your bragging. "Your studies are politically motivated. I just told you that for every mask study you post, i can counter with one that says they dont work".  Then show me an article that clearly states that Masks are not effective against the spread of Covid-19, that has studies, and sources.  "Two compelling case reports also suggest that masks can prevent transmission in high-risk scenarios, said Chin-Hong and Rutherford. In one case, a man flew from China to Toronto and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. He had a dry cough and wore a mask on the flight, and all 25 people closest to him on the flight tested negative for COVID-19. In another case, in late May, two hair stylists in Missouri had close contact with 140 clients while sick with COVID-19. Everyone wore a mask and none of the clients tested positive."  Is that politically motivated to you? "One category of evidence comes from laboratory studies of respiratory droplets and the ability of various masks to block them. An experiment using high-speed video found that hundreds of droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers were generated when saying a simple phrase, but that nearly all these droplets were blocked when the mouth was covered by a damp washcloth."  Is that politically motivated?  Stop lying and actually read and do what you say.  And just because Sweden didn't have mask mandates or lockdowns doesn't mean nobody wore masks, because a lot of people in Sweden are not dumb, arrogant, ignorant, and hypocritical like you.</p>

        <p>You're not though.</p>
<p>A car crash is much more likely to be fatal than COViD is, unless perhaps you're very old and in that case your body becomes more fragile and I'd be willing to bet fatality rates are comparable in that age group between both tragedies.</p>
<p>Also, some of that equipment can hurt you too, like airbags. Know people with some BUSTED noses from that to say the least. Seatbelts can bruise and glass can break. </p>
<p>We deal with situations that could cause irreparable damage to us every day. But we must learn to live with this temporarily like we have before.</p>
<p>We should be cautious, of course, but we shouldn't panic. There is no good type of panic, and as a severe anxiety sufferer I vouch for my statement.</p>
<p>Fine line between the two states of mind</p>

        <p>That CDC study talks about influenza not covid-19, they are not the same, and are you really stupid enough to forget that they showed evidence why masks are effective to stop the spread of the virus: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html  So you are wrong about, "Cdc studies tell you it doesnt work".  It's like you don't read your own sources.  No sweden does not have herd immunity, you could check my other comments to know why.  And Sweden has more deaths than norway, you still have not explained that yet ( I wonder why?)  And your own sources even said that Sweden has not achieved herd immunity, "David Oxley, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, said the contraction showed Sweden was not “immune to Covid".  No where in your articles does it say that masks don't protect from Covid-19.   And really, you think the molecules from a vape are the same thing as Covid-19?  How dumb do you have to be to think that they are the same?  Vape molecules are about 0.1 microns small. One Covid-19 virus is about 0.125 microns.  Vape molecules can go straight through.  So next time I suggest you fact check yourself before you start misinforming.  And that video, said that sweden doesn't need a vaccine or lockdown or masks.  They do,  unless they want it to spread to other people which makes this last even longer.  And they do need a vaccine,  because if everyone else gets a vaccine but Sweden, they would keep spreading it to other people.  This happens because when someone is sick with the virus, it multiplies quickly, and it multiplies a lot.  And since it multiplies, the virus could mutate and a new strain would go into a person that was immunized to the last strain, not the new one and therefore they get sick. Do you get it? And look at the  channel's other videos.  Clearly this man isn't a doctor, he gives opinions, and doesn't even fact check.  So now I believe you are the ignorant.</p>

<p>That is only an inference (AKA a hypothesis). You would need perform a scientific experiment to create evidence that proves your hypothesis true. The CDC and the WHO could have easily conducted such a experiment by now within the last 8 months, but they have not. Why, it's almost as if there's no evidence to prove that masks do in fact prevent COVID-19 from spreading.</p>
<p>&rt; that video said that Sweden doesn't need a vaccine or lockdown or masks. They do, unless they want it to spread to other people which makes this last even longer. </p>
<p>No, what makes this last longer is when you stop a population from achieving herd immunity. Do you remember how everyone initially showed the graph featuring the two curves when they were saying "Just two more weeks to flatten the curve!"? If you integrate the area under both of the curves, the number of people infected is exactly the same. The government and health officials knew straight from the start that the lockdowns and other measures to slow down the spread of COVID-19 would NOT reduce the total number of people infected in the end. And if you noticed carefully, they only ever claimed that all these bogus precautions would only <em>slow down the spread</em> at best.</p>
<p>FACT: A successful vaccination program requires herd immunity, so either way, we will never be able to defeat COVID-19 without herd immunity.</p>
<p>&rt; Just wear the god-damn mask</p>
<p>First off, not all masks are created equally. You're the same type of person who would insist that EVERYBODY should vaccinate themselves (which actually works) in order to achieve herd immunity, and yet you also believe that we should NOT go along with Sweden's herd immunity strategy. You are foolish to argue against this.</p>
<p>And how do you explain how Hong Kong and Taiwan's infection rates have not gone down despite ~99% of those populations wearing masks?</p>
<p>You don't know what you're talking about.</p>

        <p>&rt;Polls suggest Swedes have started to lose faith in their country’s response to the pandemic </p>
<p>You are a <strong>pathetic</strong> liar. I want to those polls </p>
<p>https://www.thelocal.se/20200831/sweden-remains-an-outlier-despite-nordic-u-turn-on-face-masks </p>
<p>Thats a Swedish newspaper article. Straight from the horses mouth </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sweden never closed its schools, businesses or cafes and restaurants, allowing the virus to circulate, and has had a consistently high level of community transmission. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its daily death toll peaked in April and is now down to a couple of deaths a day, the number of cases have been in steady decline since early June, and its R-number has pretty much stayed under 1 since early July </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell of the Public Health Agency insists scientific studies have not proven that masks are effective in limiting the spread of the virus, suggesting they can do more harm than good if used
sloppily. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"To try to replace those measures with face masks won't work," Tegnell insisted. "Several countries that introduced masks are now seeing big resurgences," he said on August 14th. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stockholmer Gilbert Sylwander, 69, peruses the masks at Ohlsson's shop, admiring the bright designs. <strong>He says he has faith in the Swedish Public Health Agency's strategy.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>"It seems as if they were right about many things with their research," he tells AFP.</strong></p>

        <p>What are you on about?</p>
<p>I'm not arguing if masks are effective or not, you gave the example of "If masks work" in your post. Given that masks work, social distancing should still be applied, due to stuff like air going out the sides or improper usage, like I've said. That's my point, I'm not trying to debate you on something that you wouldn't change your mind about. I was just highlighting the poor line of reasoning used in your post.</p>

        <p>Yes, you’re arguing against them by suggesting that in a situation where masks work, social distancing wouldn’t be logical to apply.

        <p>Okay. Let me elaborate once more.</p>
<p>Even in a scenario where masks are as effective as possible for the purpose that they serve, that being to reduce spread from an infected individual, masks aren’t 100% effective at reducing spread. Again, they aren’t a hazmat suit.</p>
<p>As I’ve previously mentioned, air still comes out the top and sides of the mask, people touch their masks, people wear their masks incorrectly, people rub their eyes, point being, there are plenty of vectors for transmission. </p>
<p>On the other hand, all of those vectors require close personal contact in order to actually spread the virus. The air exhaled from coughing or sneezing, while still present, is drastically reduced in both range and volume from wearing nothing at all, and you’d have to actually touch somebody to spread the virus through something like touching your mask or rubbing your eye.</p>
<p>As such, social distancing is used, in addition to masks, in order to further reduce and mitigate the spread of the virus.</p>

        <p>&rt;If seatbelts work why airbags? </p>
<p>Seatbelts keep your body in the car </p>
<p>Airbags cushion the blow to your face and organs </p>
<p>&rt;If airbags works, why seatbelts?   </p>
<p>See above. </p>
<p>&rt;If both work, why brakes? </p>
<p>Thats an idiotic statement. 
Do brakes keep you in the car or cushion against impact? </p>
<p>The function of brakes is to stop the car or reduce its speed.</p>
<p>&rt;If all of them work, why car insurance?</p>

        <p>Masks reduce the amount of germs in the air.<br>
Social distancing ensures that we don’t touch each other and keeps everyone from breathing in what germs masks don’t stop.<br>
Lockdown is an emergency measure to keep people socially distanced.<br>
The vaccine will greatly reduce the cases and spread.<br>
The no liability clause is in place to protect the companies from (pretty rare) vaccine injuries that can happen.<br>
Just like in a car, each safety measure works together to keep people safe.</p>

        <p>"freedom hating". Do you even know what freedom is?  Its okay to live your life however you want, as long as it doesn't hurt anybody else (Just like a virus spreads)  But you think making you take precautions to protect other is taking your freedom away?  That is selfishness at its finest.  It's like saying that the law making you drive sober is taking your freedom away because "you should drive however you want."</p>

        <p>I think I can probably talk for the majority of people here when I say that we were ok with staying home for 2 weeks to help “flatten the curve” and make sure hospitals weren’t overwhelmed. </p>
<p>THAT WAS 7 MONTHS AGO. Hospital capacity hasn’t been talked about for months now. They have completely upended society over this, destroyed hundreds of thousand of jobs and livelihoods, and yes, took away people’s rights and freedoms to varying degrees of authoritarianism depending on where you live. All for a virus that over 99% of people will be completely fine from. If you don’t realize that the second order effects from this are going to be FAR more costly and deadly, then you really are brainwashed.</p>

        <p>The reasons why we survived past plagues like the Black plague was because it killed 1/3 of Europe and because it killed people so fast it ran out hosts.  You wouldn't want that to happen today.  And when I used my analogy I was talking about how you could injure someone or even kill them.  It doesn't matter if it's natural or not because if you knew you could possibly or absolutely know you have Covid-19, and you didn't follow social distancing or wear a mask someone's death would be your fault. And Sweden is not doing so well, and no herd immunity isn't a good idea for covid-19:https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/herd-immunity-and-coronavirus/art-20486808 and :https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87812 and https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/sweden-keeps-ban-large-gatherings-covid-19-cases-rise and Taiwan :https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/30/taiwan-lessons-fighting-covid-19-using-electronic-health-records/ So don't try to use that as an argument. (and again, you could always check their sources) So now, "Youve graduated from moron to imbecile".</p>

        <p>"But the strategy has also resulted in Sweden having one of the highest death rates in the world, at <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">56.4 per 100,000</a>, and it’s unclear whether the economy will fare much better than in neighboring Denmark and Norway, which initially imposed strict lockdowns and have seen substantially lower fatalities. "  That was in one of your articles, It just proved you wrong.  I was talking about the deaths and how herd immunity is not a good idea for Covid-19.  Another article of yours also states, " David Oxley, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, said the contraction showed Sweden was not “immune to Covid”. "  So your own evidence disproves your, " We have this clever feature called an immune system and as Sweden has proven it works for the healthy when left to do its thing."  And don't forget your article also says, " For several weeks this spring, Sweden had the highest death rate per capita in Europe, and one that was 20 times that of neighbouring Norway. "  And don't brag about, "  I can sleep through her "writing" classes and get As." We all know that is not true, because you can't even spell you've or I'm correctly. It seems like you don't like the idea of you being wrong, even with your own evidence proving you wrong. It looks like you can't accept you are not always right can you? So I suggest next time listen to actual doctors and credible sources with evidence.  Science is more important than an idea that has been proven wrong.</p>

<p>Do you see the potential issue of assuming any criticism of a particular view point equates to advocacy of the polar opposite of that viewpoint?</p>
<p>Your last statement we agree 100% on and thats my point: By making broad assumptions / absolute statements and downvoting anything that even remotely touches on criticism creates an echo chamber no better than /r/coronavirus.</p>
