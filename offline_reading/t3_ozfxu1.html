    <strong>Is a Coronavirus Vaccine a Ticking Time Bomb? The potential for Antibody Dependent Enhancement from Covid-19 vaccines.</strong>
    <p><p>Here is a fantastic article that explains in layman's terms the potential for Antibody Dependent Enhancement due to the use of Covid-19 vaccines.</p>
<p><a href="https://sciencewithdrdoug.com/2020/08/01/is-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-ticking-time-bomb/">https://sciencewithdrdoug.com/2020/08/01/is-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-ticking-time-bomb/</a></p>
<p>I highly recommend reading the entire article but here are a few tidbits:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;For a vaccine to work, our immune system needs to be stimulated to produce a neutralizing antibody, as opposed to a non-neutralizing antibody. A neutralizing antibody is one that can recognize and bind to some region (‘epitope’) of the virus, and that subsequently results in the virus either not entering or replicating in your cells.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;\~\~\~<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In some viruses, if a person harbors a non-neutralizing antibody to the virus, a subsequent infection by the virus can cause that person to elicit a more severe reaction to the virus due to the presence of the non-neutralizing antibody.  This is not true for all viruses, only particular ones.  This is called Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE), and is a common problem with Dengue Virus, Ebola Virus, HIV, RSV, and the family of coronaviruses.  In fact, this problem of ADE is a major reason why many previous vaccine trials for other coronaviruses failed. Major safety concerns were observed in animal models. If ADE occurs in an individual, their response to the virus can be worse than their response if they had never developed an antibody in the first place.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;\~\~\~<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;ADE has proven to be a serious challenge with coronavirus vaccines, and this is the primary reason many have failed in early in-vitro or animal trials. For example, rhesus macaques who were vaccinated with the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV virus demonstrated severe acute lung injury when challenged with SARS-CoV, while monkeys who were not vaccinated did not. Similarly, mice who were immunized with one of four different SARS-CoV vaccines showed histopathological changes in the lungs with eosinophil infiltration after being challenged with SARS-CoV virus. This did not occur in the controls that had not been vaccinated.  A similar problem occurred in the development of a vaccine for FIPV, which is a feline coronavirus.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;For a vaccine to work, vaccine developers will need to find a way to circumvent the ADE problem. This will require a very novel solution, and it may not be achievable, or at the very least, predictable. In addition, the vaccine must not induce ADE in subsequent strains of SARS-CoV-2 that emerge over time, or to other endemic coronaviruses that circulate every year and cause the common cold.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;\~\~\~<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;A major trigger for ADE is viral mutation. Changes to the amino acid sequence of the Spike Protein  (which is the protein on the virus that facilitates entry into our cells via the ACE2 receptor) can cause antigenic drift. What this means is that an antibody that was once neutralizing can become a non-neutralizing antibody because the antigen has slightly changed. Therefore, mutations in the Spike protein that naturally occur with coronaviruses could presumably result in ADE. Since these future strains are not predictable, it is impossible to predict if ADE will become a problem at a future date.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This inherent unpredictability problem is highlighted in the following scenario: A coronavirus vaccine may not be dangerous initially. If the initial testing looks positive, mass vaccination efforts would presumably be administered to a large portion of the population. In the first year or two, it may appear that there is no real safety issue, and over time, a greater percentage of the world population will be vaccinated due to this perceived “safety”. During this interim period, the virus is busy mutating. Eventually, the antibodies that vaccinated individuals have floating around in their bloodstream are now rendered non-neutralizing because they fail to bind to the virus with the same affinity due to the structural change resulting from the mutation. Declining concentrations of the antibody over time would also contribute to this shift towards non-neutralization.  When these previously vaccinate people are infected with this different strain of SARS-CoV-2, they could experience a much more severe reaction to the virus.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>And there's more....</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Does this vaccine industry know about this problem? <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The answer is yes, they do.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Quoting a Nature Biotechnology news article published on June 5th, 2020:““It’s important to talk about it [ADE],” says Gregory Glenn, president of R&amp;D at Novavax, which launched its COVID-19 vaccine trial in May. But “we can’t be overly cautious. People are dying. So we need to be aggressive here.””<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And from the same article:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“ADE “is a genuine concern,” says virologist Kevin Gilligan, a senior consultant with Biologics Consulting, who advises thorough safety studies. “Because if the gun is jumped, and a vaccine is widely distributed that is disease enhancing, that would be worse than actually not doing any vaccination at all.””<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The vaccine industry is aware of this problem. The degree to which they are taking it seriously, is another question.While many vaccine developers are aware of the problem, some of them are approaching the problem with more Laissez-faire attitude. They see this problem as “theoretical,” and not guaranteed, with the idea that animal trials should rule out the potential of ADE in humans.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>And there's still more..... Even Pfizer and the FDA acknowledge this potential problem in the official vaccine literature!</strong> <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download</a> - pg. 52</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Vaccine-enhanced disease<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Available data do not indicate a risk of vaccine-enhanced disease, and conversely suggest effectiveness against severe disease within the available follow-up period. However, risk of vaccine-enhanced disease over time, potentially associated with waning immunity, remains unknown and needs to be evaluated further in ongoing clinical trials and in observational studies that could be conducted following authorization and/or licensure.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It seems that the medical industry is glossing over and dismissing the potential because studies have not shown any ADE happening <strong>yet</strong>. The problem is that ADE occurs most commonly in two very specific scenarios: (1) in the case of waning antibody protection and (2) in the case of variants that do not precisely match the antibodies generated by the vaccine. The studies that were done did not test these two specific conditions as they tend to take place in the mid or long term future.</p>

        <p>The only way to make a real covid vaccine is to take a weak dying version of the virus and introduce it to someone as a flu nasal spray, this gives your body what it needs to naturally immunize it self without any thing else... Granted... They can't seem to get a sample of covid from any one (meaning this whole thing was probably a hoax) and as such cannot make a vaccine....</p>
