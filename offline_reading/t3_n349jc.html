    <strong>Pathologer explains the covid scam lucidly.</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry if this has been posted before. Didn't see it yet. A (pensioned) pathologist explains in clear language that we are being scammed. He cannot be sacked, which is why he can be so open.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I was saying this from the beginning. In a real pandemic you have people dying left and right. No matter what age. On any given street in America there will be people dying. That's what an actual pandemic is. </p>
<p>That's not what this was. A virus so deadly you have to be tested to know you even have it. So deadly you have a 99.98% chance of living.</p>

        <p>on average. Many people getting injected with experimental RNA are so young, it's more like 9,9997% or so.  </p>
<p>If we would count like we did with the flu, and call most of the deaths natural deaths because they happen at like 80+, the average would be significantly close to 100%</p>

        <p>I didn't learn anything from this video, but he was spot on with everything he said.</p>
<p>The only things I had any disagreement with him on was that the vaccines have been successful, since we still don't know the long term effects. </p>
<p>His opinion was that these measures have been put in place because the government want to appear to be doing something, are acting upon the worst case scenario and are generally idiots when it comes to anything scientific.</p>
<p>He also said that he felt that the restrictions have continued because the government don't want to admit that they made a mistake and they have forgotten why they implemented the measures in the first place. He feels that they are constantly moving the goalposts in order to aim for zero COVID, which will be impossible. </p>
<p>I think his views on why these restrictions were implemented and have continued despite the fact that they clearly don't work are extremely optimistic and also na√Øve. I don't think governments could genuinely be stupid enough to think these measures are for the best.</p>

        <p>I could not agree more. But maybe this would be a good bridge for many of those who tremble in fear for the covaids.</p>
